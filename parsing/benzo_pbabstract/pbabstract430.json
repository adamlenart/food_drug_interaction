Rats were given two daily injections of muscimol (0.1 mg/kg M1 group of 0.2 mg/kg M2 group) or ethanol (1.5 g/kg) between the 1st and 21st postnatal days, with saline-treated animals serving as controls. At the age of one month, the activity of the M2 rats was decreased in the open-field arena. At the age of four months, ethanol-treated rats consumed less 10% ethanol solution in a free choice situation. No changes were seen in the elevated plus-maze test. Maximal GABA stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was decreased in the cerebellum and hippocampus in M2 rats at the age of one month but not four months. A significant positive correlation was found in all rats between maximal GABA-stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the cerebellum and ambulation in the open-field arena at the age of one month. Ethanol intake correlated negatively with maximal GABA stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the cerebral cortex. None of the treatments affected the cerebellar binding of an imidazobenzodiazepine, [3H]Ro 15-4513. There was an age-dependent decline in the efficacy and potency (EC50) of the GABA enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the cerebellum in all treatment groups. Basal binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to hippocampal and cerebellar membranes as well as binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 to cerebellar membranes was also decreased as a function of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Male rats at six different ages received diazepam on a 4-day treatment schedule. Cross-tolerance to hexobarbital was tested several times during withdrawal period with an anaesthesia threshold technique. Pattern of cross-tolerance was different at different ages. Thus, age and maturation of the rat is a variable which must be considered in studies of tolerance to diazepam.", 
    "2": "Carbachol, a full muscarinic receptor agonist, stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in both the ventral and dorsal hippocampus, but its efficacy and affinity were higher in the former area. The partial agonist oxotremorine had a weak stimulatory effect in both regions. The affinity profiles of pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 in antagonizing carbachol-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation indicated that M1 and M3 receptors contributed equally to the response in either region. On the other hand, there were no differences in the receptor density, or in the distribution of muscarinic receptor subtypes between the two regions of the hippocampus which could account for the effect as determined in binding experiments with selective antagonists. Analysis of carbachol binding curves did, instead, indicate a difference in the way the agonist interacted with the receptors within the hippocampus, i.e., carbachol recognized three agonist affinity states (superhigh, high and low) in the ventral hippocampus, and only two (high and low) in the dorsal part. The findings thus suggested that the regional diversity in the efficacy of carbachol in stimulating phosphoinositide turnover was related to the complexity with which it bound to muscarinic receptors. Transduction processes that intervene between changes in the muscarinic receptors' conformation and activation of phospholipase C might be relevant to these differences.", 
    "3": "The role of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger of heart mitochondria in cellular functioning is not yet clear. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of stimulation and inhibition of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger on the matrix free Ca2+ concentration in isolated heart mitochondria and to determine the consequences of these changes on the rate of NADH production via Krebs cycle turnover and the oxidative phosphorylation rate (OPR) supported by alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, a Ca(2+)-regulated matrix enzyme. Activation of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange by increasing extramitochondrial Na+ concentration was found to decrease the matrix free [Ca2+] in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibitors of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity inhibited the decrease in matrix free [Ca2+] mediated by Na+. Increasing concentrations of Na+ were also found to inhibit both the rate of NADH production and OPR. Inhibitors of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange also blocked the effects of Na+ on the rate of NADH production and OPR in a similar concentration range. The results indicate that alterations in matrix free [Ca2+] induced by changes in mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity are translated into changes in the rate of NADH production and the overall rate of oxidative phosphorylation.",

Cyclothiazide 10 microM also reversed the action of a 2,3-benzodiazepine, GYKI 53655, which is a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, but not that of the quinoxalinedione, NBQX, which is a competitive AMPA receptor antagonist.", 
    "5": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Two classes of GABA receptors (GABAA and GABAB) have been identified. GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels that are competitively antagonized by bicuculline, noncompetitively blocked by picrotoxin, and often allosterically modulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. GABAB receptors regulate potassium and calcium channels through G-protein and intracellular second-messenger pathways, are selectively activated by baclofen, and are antagonized by phaclofen and 2-hydroxysaclofen. For some years, evidence has accumulated that there are GABA receptors, especially prominent along visual pathways, which are neither antagonized by bicuculline nor activated by baclofen, but are activated by certain conformationally restricted analogues of GABA, including cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA). These receptors have been designated GABAC receptors. As yet, membrane current responses from isolated neurons that reflect this novel pharmacology have not been reported, although such responses have been recorded from oocytes injected with retinal messenger RNA. Here we describe a chloride-mediated current response from isolated rod-driven horizontal cells (H4) of the white perch retina that has this novel pharmacology.", 
    "6": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, is known to operate bicuculline-sensitive Cl- channels through GABAA receptors and bicuculline-insensitive cation channels through GABAB receptors. Recent observations indicate that the retina may contain GABA receptors with unusual pharmacological properties. Here we report that GABA gates bicuculline-insensitive Cl- channels in rod bipolar cells of the rat retina, which were not modulated by flunitrazepam, pentobarbital and alphaxalone and were only slightly blocked by picrotoxinin. Moreover, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen, and the antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen had no effect. The underlying single-channel conductance was 7 pS and the open time 150 ms. These values are clearly different from those obtained for GABAA receptor channels recorded in other neurons of the same preparation, and in other parts of the brain. The bicuculline- and baclofen-insensitive GABA receptors were activated selectively by the GABA analogue cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA). Hence they may be similar to those receptors termed GABAC receptors.",

    "11": "The distribution and number of DA uptake sites, DA receptors (D1 and D2) and cholinergic muscarinic receptors (M1 and M2) were examined by autoradiography in the striatal complex of Parkinson's and age-matched control cases. The greatest loss of DA uptake sites occurred in the dorsolateral striatum which was the only region showing an increase in D2 receptors. The number of M2 receptors was reduced in the dorsolateral striatum and M1 receptors were reduced in most regions of the striatum. The anatomical pattern of changes in DA uptake sites, D2 receptors and M2 receptors suggests a coordinated change in the dopaminergic-cholinergic interneuron synapse in Parkinson's disease.", 
    "12": "Replacement of Met31 by (N-Me)Nle in CCK8 or CCK4 has been shown to improve the affinity and selectivity for CCK-B receptors. In order to obtain molecules with enhanced bioavailability, two novel series of protected tetrapeptides of the general formula Boc-Trp30-X-Asp-Y33 have been developed. Introduction of (N-Me)Nle and the bulky, aromatic naphthylalaninamide (Nal-NH2) in positions X and Y, respectively, does not greatly modify the affinity for guinea pig brain CCK-B receptors. In contrast, incorporation of hindering N-methyl amino acids such as (N-Me)Phe, (N-Me)Phg, or (N-Me)Chg, but not their non-methylated counterparts, in position X induced a large decrease in affinity for the CCK-B binding sites. Among the various peptides synthesized, Boc-[(N-Me)Nle31,1Nal-NH2(33)]CCK4 (2) (KI = 2.8 nM), Boc-[Phg31,1Nal-NH2(33)]CCK4 (15) (KI = 14 nM), and Boc-[Phg31,1Nal-N(CH3)2(33)]CCK4 (17) (KI = 39 nM) displayed good affinities for brain CCK-B receptors and had good selectivity ratios. These pseudopeptides, in which the presence of unnatural and hydrophobic residues is expected to improve their penetration of the central nervous system, were shown to be very resistant to brain peptidases. Interestingly, whereas compounds 2 and 15 proved to be full agonists for rat hippocampal CCK-B receptors when measured in an electrophysiological assay, compound 17 behaved as a potent antagonist in the same test and displayed a good affinity in rat brain KI(CCK-B) = 51 nM as compared to the Merck antagonist L365,260,KI(CCK-B) = 12 nM. This illustrates a simple means to obtain CCK-B antagonists and suggests that the free, CONH2 group plays a critical role in the recognition of the agonist state of brain CCK-B receptors.",

The compounds were evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for the muscarinic cholinergic receptor. The best M2-selective antimuscarinic agent studied is 5-[[4-[4-diethylamino)butyl]-1- piperidinyl]acetyl]-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepin-11- one, which is approximately 10 times more potent at M2 receptors than previously known compounds such as 11-[[4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]- 1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one (AQ-RA 741).", 
    "14": "The role of several P450 enzymes in the metabolism of diazepam (DZ) has been investigated. Hepatic microsomes of adult male rats were pretreated with antisera raised against the P450s CYP3A2, 2B1, 2C6, 2C11, 2D1 and 2E1, and their influence on the subsequent metabolism of DZ was determined by simultaneously measuring the changes in the relative rates of formation of its metabolites. Several forms of P450 were found to be positively involved in DZ metabolism. Antisera of the \"male-specific\" P450 enzyme CYP2C11 partially inhibited both DZ N-demethylase and C3 hydroxylase activities (60%) which resulted in decreased formations of N-desmethyl-DZ (NDZ) and 3-hydroxy-DZ (3HDZ), respectively. In a reconstitution experiment with the purified enzyme, CYP2C11 predominantly catalysed the formation of NDZ from DZ. Antisera of a further male-specific P450 CYP3A2 strongly inhibited (95%) the C3 hydroxylase of DZ and thus 3HDZ formation. A corresponding reconstitution experiment with this same P450 enzyme gave 3HDZ as principal product. CYP2D1 antisera inhibited the aromatic hydroxylation of DZ (98%) and subsequent formation of 4'-hydroxy-DZ (4'HDZ). This enzyme was also observed to inhibit DZ N-demethylase activity (60%). A reconstitution experiment with pure CYP2D1 catalysed the formation of both 4'HDZ and NDZ.",

Following an initial bolus injection, the radiotracer [123I]iomazenil was infused at a constant rate for 5 to 8 h. This procedure induced a state of sustained equilibrium at the receptor level. Nondisplaceable activity was measured after injection of a receptor saturating dose of flumazenil. Experiments performed at high and low specific activity permitted estimation of an equilibrium binding affinity constant of 0.47 nM and a maximum binding capacity of 127 nM in occipital cortex.", 
    "16": "Muscarinic receptors in murine fibrosarcoma HSDM1C1 cells were characterized using both radioligand binding and total inositol phosphates accumulation (IPs). Muscarinic agonists elicited a concentration-dependent enhancement of IPs accumulation with a maximum of 14-fold stimulation above basal level. The following potencies (-log EC50) were observed for the full agonists: (+)-cis-dioxolane 5.4, oxotremorine-M 5.3, (+)-muscarine 5.2 and carbachol 5.0. Bethanechol (4.1) and arecoline (5.0) were partial agonists, evoking 43 and 55%, respectively of the maximum level of stimulation to (+)-cis-dioxolane, whereas pilocarpine and McN-A-343 were inactive as agonists (1 mumol/l-1 mmol/1). The apparent affinities for muscarinic antagonists (-log KB) estimated by Schild regression were: 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide) 9.2, dicyclomine 7.0, pirenzepine 6.9, (+/-)-p-F-HHSiD (para-fluoro-hexahydro-siladifenidol) 7.0, AF-DX 116 6.2, methoctramine 5.7. In saturation binding studies using [3H]N-methylscopolamine a homogeneous population of sites was identified, with a density of 145 pmol/mg protein. In competition radioligand binding studies, the following apparent affinities (-log Ki) were observed: 4-DAMP 9.7, dicyclomine 8.3, (+/-)-p-F-HHSiD 7.6, AF-DX 116 6.8, methoctramine 6.6 and gallamine 6.8. In binding studies all antagonists studied recognized a single population of sites, as judged by the Hill coefficients from the displacement isotherms. These data are consistent with HSDM1C1 cells expressing an apparent homogeneous muscarinic M3 population that mediates a large level of total IPs accumulation. This clonal line may provide a useful model to further elucidate relationship between endogenous muscarinic M3 receptor stimulation and IPs accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "24": "Benzodiazepine-induced modifications of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) activated Cl- currents were studied in native GABAA receptors expressed in neonatal rat brain cortical neurons in primary cultures and in recombinant GABAA receptors expressed in transformed human embryonic kidney cells (293) after a transient transfection with cDNAs encoding for different molecular forms of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of GABAA receptors. The efficacy of triazolam in cortical neurons was higher than that of diazepam. In transfected cells, triazolam showed a greater efficacy as a positive modulator of GABA-elicited Cl- currents in alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1, alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 3, alpha 6 beta 1 gamma 2 and alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors than diazepam, except in alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors where diazepam was more efficacious. When triazolam and diazepam were applied together to GABAA receptors assembled by transfecting cDNAs encoding for alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 subunits, the action of triazolam was curtailed in a manner related to the dose of diazepam. In recombinant receptors assembled with alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 receptors, maximally active doses of triazolam were more efficacious than those of clonazepam, alpidem, zolpidem, diazepam or bretazenil.",

The c-fos expression in these areas was suppressed by the administration of L364,718 (120 micrograms/kg). Since L364,718 is known to be a powerful selective antagonist to the peripheral CCK-A receptors, these data suggest that the effects produced by exogenous CCK are due to peripheral receptors that project to the NTS.", 
    "26": "Akathisia is frequently reported to be caused by neuroleptic drugs and sometimes by certain other agents such as fluoxetine. Benzodiazepines are a common treatment. The principal mechanism of akathisia is thought to be neurochemical, probably dopaminergic with serotonin also playing an important role. It is not usually thought to be related to benzodiazepine-caused disinhibition. Four episodes of atypical or paradoxical benzodiazepine-induced akathisia in three patients are reported and analyzed. All four episodes of akathisia were atypical because they were caused by clonazepam, clorazepate, or lorazepam. In one patient neither thiothixene nor lorazepam caused akathisia, but clonazepam and clorazepate did. In another patient both lorazepam and fluoxetine caused akathisia. It is also noted that all three patients had a history of traumatic brain injury and seizure disorder. The data support the hypothesis that atypical benzodiazepine-induced akathisia exists. Its mechanism may be different from neuroleptic-induced akathisia, but may still involve serotonergic systems or the forced normalization phenomenon. The similarity of these cases to reports of benzodiazepine-induced disinhibition raises the possibility that in some patients they may be the same entity.", 
    "27": "Diazepam (10 mg) was administered to two men performing a delayed matching-to-sample task in which the number of elements in a compound sample stimulus (one of which appeared among 4 comparison stimuli) was manipulated from 1 to 3. After each trial, subjects pressed either a \"Yes\" or \"No\" button in response to a computer-presented query about whether the last choice met a point contingency requiring selection of the matching comparison stimulus within a time limit. Diazepam simultaneously produced marginal decreases in matching-to-sample performance and more pronounced decreases in the accuracy of self-reports about the same performance. Diazepam selectively increased false reports of success; false reports of failure were not systematically affected. A signal-detection analysis summarized these patterns as a decrease in self-report discriminability (A') with no systematic change in bias (B'(H)). These preliminary results converge with those of clinical lore and the results of studies with other benzodiazepine drugs in suggesting that diazepam can produce an \"overconfidence\" in performance self-evaluation, the mechanisms and parameters of which remain to be identified. The results were inconsistent with those of one previous study of diazepam's effects on performance self-evaluation, but given procedural differences between the two studies, the discrepancy may reflect the functional independence of verbal operant classes in Skinner's (1957) taxonomy.", 
    "28": "The current research methods, findings and questions that are being addressed in studies of the pharmacology of human memory and cognition are reviewed. Memory is not a unitary function. Neuropsychological studies of brain-damaged memory-impaired patients, as well as neuroimaging and drug studies in normal individuals indicate that different forms of learning and memory are subserved by different brain systems. Animal drug studies have also provided evidence that, while distinct, memory systems are not independent, but operate in close interaction with one another. Recent human studies of benzodiazepines and of cholinergic drugs demonstrate the value of the psychological models and of the experimental paradigms that are available from cognitive sciences for exploring how drugs alter cognitive and memory functions. They also show how drugs can be used as tools for analyzing the distinct neurochemical mechanisms underlying independent cognitive processes, and so find effective drugs rationally from a knowledge of the neurochemical bases of cognition. This research leads to specific recommendations concerning treatments that may improve memory functioning, for instance in Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "29": "The present reference drugs for the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia are imipramine and alprazolam. The latter decreases performance and cognitive functioning. No study of such functions in panic/agoraphobia is available. Fifty four out-patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PAG), taking part in a parallel groups controlled trial of imipramine (mean dose \u00b1SEM 114\u00b19 mg), clomipramine (50\u00b14 mg) and propanteline (active placebo) over 8 weeks, were studied. A test battery of psychomotor and memory tests was administered at baseline, and after 1, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Their results were compared (at baseline and at the end of the trial) with those of a control group of 57 normal untreated subjects. There was no difference between treatments, and no drug effect on any test at any time. No consistent difference between patients and controls was detected. Given its apparently higher potency, and the absence of deleterious effects on cognitive measures known to be affected by benzodiazepines, we conclude that clomipramine is better than imipramine or alprazolam as a reference drug for panic/agoraphobia.", 
    "30": "Fifteen normal volunteers were administered placebo, 0.250, 0.375 and 0.500 mg of triazolam in a double- blind cross-over design. Triazolam induced robust dose-dependent impairments in explicit memory of information presented after drug administration. Subjects were unaware of their memory deficit (an impairment in meta-cognition). In contrast, memory for information presented prior to the administration of triazolam was facilitated following the administration of low doses of triazolam. Implicit memory and access to knowledge memory was unaltered by this benzodiazepine. An analysis of these results controlling for concurrent sedation as measured subjectively, through the use of self rating scales and objectively, based upon psychomotor performance, demonstrated that the amnestic effects of triazolam are largely independent of sedative effects. The pattern of memory changes induced by benzodiazepines, such as triazolam, is similar to the memory inpairment expressed in amnestic patients but unlike the pattern of impaired memory evident in dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "31": "Oxazepam and its chlorinated derivative, lorazepam, have similar half-lives but differing potencies. This study compared the effects of these two benzodiazepines with a placebo on memory, mood and psychomotor function. Thirty six volunteers took part in a double-blind, independent groups design. Subjects completed a battery of tests before and 2.5 h after drug administration. Lorazepam 2 mg produced more profound subjective and motor sedation than oxazepam 30 mg, and this in turn produced a similar, global pattern of impairments across a wide range of tasks. However, lorazepam produced greater decrements than oxazepam on a task involving episodic memory even when sedative effects were partialled out. We suggest that this finding may reflect either differential task sensitivities or a contribution of priming to performance on the explicit memory task.", 
    "32": "The effects of ipsapirone and cannabidiol (CBD) on healthy volunteers submitted to a simulated public speaking (SPS) test were compared with those of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam and placebo. Four independent groups of 10 subjects received, under a double-blind design, placebo or one of the following drugs: CBD (300 mg), diazepam (10 mg) or ipsapirone (5 mg). Subjective anxiety was evaluated through the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) and the State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The VAMS anxiety factor showed that ipsapirone attenuated SPS-induced anxiety while CBD decreased anxiety after the SPS test. Diazepam, on the other hand, was anxiolytic before and after the SPS test, but had no effect on the increase in anxiety induced by the speech test. Only ipsapirone attenuated the increase in systolic blood pressure induced by the test. Significant sedative effects were only observed with diazepam. The results suggest that ipsapirone and CBD have anxiolytic properties in human volunteers submitted to a stressful situation.", 
    "33": "Pre-natal exposure to benzodiazepines has been associated with neurobehavioral alterations in human and animal studies. To evaluate effects of pre-natal exposure on subsequent efficacy of benzodiazepine ligands, we exposed mice to lorazepam, 2 mg/kg/day, during days 14-20 of gestation and evaluated offspring at 6 weeks of age using pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions. Mice exposed to lorazepam were similar to vehicle-exposed and untreated mice in pentylenetetrazol threshold. However, lorazepam-exposed mice had a reduced threshold after an acute dose of lorazepam compared to vehicle-exposed and untreated mice. For the proconvulsant inverse agonist compound FG 7142, threshold was also reduced after pre-natal lorazepam exposure compared to the other treatment groups. These data indicate that pre-natal lorazepam exposure is associated in mature mice with a shift in benzodiazepine efficacy toward the inverse agonist range of the benzodiazepine spectrum.", 
    "34": "Neurotransmitter receptor studies are beginning to be applied more widely to human brain tissue obtained at autopsy. By taking tissue from well-documented cases which have been extensively characterized on histological and morphometric criteria, it is becoming possible to make clinicopathological correlations in studies of the effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Recent findings of alterations in the nature and amounts of amino acid neurotransmitter receptors in alcoholism are summarized, with special emphasis on the effects of chronic severe liver disease. There are selective changes in receptors in the superior frontal cortex of alcoholics. There is a marked increase in the density of the GABA binding site, and a lesser change in the density of the 'central-type' benzodiazepine site, on the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. In contrast, glutamate receptors may be much less affected. Together with morphological and cognitive studies, the results suggest that the superior frontal cortex is preferentially damaged in chronic alcoholism. An increase in 'central-type' benzodiazepine sites in both superior frontal cortex and motor cortex in cirrhotic alcoholics may reflect a more global brain damage, as observed in morphological studies. However, it should be noted the changes in [3H]GABA/muscimol binding were less pronounced in cirrhotic alcoholics than in non-cirrhotic alcoholics.", 
    "35": "Benzodiazepines (BZD) possess anticonvulsant properties that may potentially elevate seizure threshold, inhibit seizure propagation, and alter some of the neurobehavioral effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in animal models. Nevertheless, considerable controversy exists regarding the clinical impact of oral BZD use during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The existing literature is contradictory, and all studies attempting to address this topic suffer from important design flaws. Most studies are retrospective and some address only seizure duration. Also, studies examining treatment outcome are difficult to compare because of differing types and dosages of BZD, varied electrode placement and stimulus energy, and lack of information about the relationship of the stimulus energy to the patients' seizure thresholds. While firm conclusions must await further studies, limited data suggest that BZD have the potential to shorten seizure duration and decrease treatment efficacy, particularly with unilateral ECT.", 
    "36": "Ontogenic development of muscarinic receptors was examined in the hippocampus of rabbits (from P2 to P60) using radioautographic method. Muscarinic sites were labelled with (3H)-quinuclinidyl-benzilate and pharmacologically defined M1 and M2 receptor subtypes with (3H)-pirenzepine and (3H)-oxotremorine, respectively. The distribution of binding sites was compared to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in adjacent hippocampal sections. The two cholinergic components are progressively set up in the hippocampus during the first three postnatal weeks. The AChE staining was very low in all hippocampal fields in P2 rabbits. At P8 and after, the AChE staining was more pronounced in CA3 and CA4 than in CA1 and CA2. On the contrary, the M1 muscarinic binding sites were more abundant in CA1 and CA2 hippocampal fields than in CA3 and CA4 at all ages studied. M2 muscarinic binding sites were only distinguishable at P45 and have a relatively homogeneous distribution. This study shows a differential developmental evolution in the distribution of AChE and muscarinic M1 receptors, and no obvious correspondence between these two cholinergic markers was observed.", 
    "37": "Anticholinergics, benzodiazepines and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists have been shown to modulate the expression of nerve agent-induced seizures. This study examined whether the anticonvulsant actions of these drugs varied depending on the duration of prior seizure activity. Rats implanted with electrodes to record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were pretreated with the oxime HI-6 (125 mg/kg, IP) to prolong survival, and then challenged with a convulsant dose of the nerve agent soman (180 micrograms/kg, SC); treatment compounds (scopolamine, diazepam, MK-801, atropine, benactyzine, and trihexyphenidyl) were delivered IV at specific times after seizure onset. Both diazepam and MK-801 displayed a similar profile of activity: At both short or long times after seizure initiation the anticonvulsant efficacy of each drug remained the same. Diazepam, and especially MK-801, enhanced the lethal actions of soman by potentiating the respiratory depressant effects of the agent; scopolamine given prior to diazepam or MK-801 protected against the respiratory depression. Scopolamine and atropine showed a dose- and time-dependent effectiveness; the longer the seizure progressed the higher the dose of drug required to terminate the seizure, with eventual loss of anticonvulsant activity if the seizure had progressed for 40 min. In contrast, benactyzine and trihexyphenidyl showed a third profile of activity: There was a smaller increase in drug dosage required for anticonvulsant activity as seizure duration increased, and both drugs could terminate seizures that had progressed for 40 min. The early anticonvulsant action of anticholinergics is interpreted as a specific effect that blocks the primary cholinergic excitatory drive that initiates, and first maintains, nerve agent seizures. If allowed to progress, the seizure activity itself recruits excitatory neurotransmitter systems (i.e., NMDA) that eventually maintain the seizure independent of the initial cholinergic drive. This is indicated by the eventual ineffectiveness of scopolamine and atropine as the duration of the seizure progresses. Diazepam and MK-801 appear to act to moderate nerve agent seizures by enhancing inhibitory activity (diazepam) or dampening the secondarily activated noncholinergic excitatory system (MK-801). Benactyzine and trihexyphenidyl represent compounds that possibly have both anticholinergic and NMDA antagonistic properties.", 
    "38": "The number and types of target variables quantified from the spectrally analyzed EEG used in topographic pharmaco-EEG studies are still being discussed. Drug-induced changes of target variables obtained in the alpha frequency band--four absolute and four relative powers as well as three frequency measures--were utilized to assess the effects of xantinolnicotinate in demented patients using a parallel group design and the effects of buspirone in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. We conclude that for the proper evaluation of the different drug effects on the alpha activity, all these target variables should be considered. Descriptive p values of multiple comparisons within the framework of descriptive data analyses are important tools in interpreting drug effects.", 
    "39": "Twelve healthy volunteers were tested in a double-blind crossover study to assess the effects of oxazepam and an extract of kava roots (Piper methysticum) on behavior and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a recognition memory task. The subjects' task was to identify within a list of visually presented words those that were shown for the first time and those that were being repeated. The repeated words were associated with an increased positivity beginning approximately 250 ms poststimulus. Oxazepam led to a reduction of a negative component in the 250-500 ms range for both old and new words and to a reduction of the old/new difference in the ERP associated with a significantly worse recognition rate. Kava on the other hand showed a slightly increased recognition rate and a larger ERP difference between old and new words.", 
    "40": "The effects of pretreatment with a seven day course of ciprofloxacin on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an intravenous (5 mg) dose of diazepam were investigated in a group of 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Ciprofloxacin pretreatment significantly reduced diazepam CL (without ciprofloxacin: 19.5 ml.h-1 kg-1; with ciprofloxacin: 12.3 ml.h-1 kg-1). Diazepam t1/2 was also prolonged (without ciprofloxacin: 36.7 h; with ciprofloxacin: 71.1 h), but volume of distribution was unaltered (without ciprofloxacin: 1.1 l.kg-1; with ciprofloxacin: 1.1 l.kg-1). However, no significant changes were detected in psychometric tests of digit symbol substitution, tapping rate and short memory, as well as levels of concentration, vigilance and tension measured by visual analogue scales.", 
    "41": "The effects of epinephrine-free and epinephrine-containing local anesthetic solutions on plasma potassium and blood glucose concentrations were investigated in 20 patients undergoing oral surgery with intravenous midazolam sedation. Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive 4.4 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine as a local anesthetic and 10 were given 4.4 mL of 3% prilocaine with 0.03 IU/mL felypressin. There were significant changes from baseline potassium and glucose concentrations both within and between treatments in the early postinjection period. The epinephrine-containing local anesthetic significantly reduced the plasma potassium concentration 10 min after injection, by 0.16 +/- 0.20 mmol/L (mean +/- SD), and increased the blood glucose concentration at 10, 20, and 30 min (by 0.46 +/- 0.37, 0.63 +/- 0.45, and 0.56 +/- 0.28 mmol/L, respectively). Conversely, plasma potassium increased and blood glucose decreased 10, 20, and 30 min following the administration of the epinephrine-free solution. At 30 min potassium was increased by 0.24 +/- 0.16 mmol/L, and glucose was decreased by 0.23 +/- 0.16 mmol/L. It is concluded that epinephrine-free and epinephrine-containing local anesthetics differ in their metabolic effects during oral surgery with midazolam sedation.", 
    "42": "Conscious sedation was provided for a 21-yr-old mentally retarded and cardiovascularly compromised women who required dental extractions, by initially infusing propofol (3 mg/kg/hr), augmented with a bolus dose of intravenous midazolam (1 mg). After 45 min the propofol infusion rate was reduced to 1 mg/kg/hr. The patient remained well-sedated during the entire procedure and no adverse effects were experienced.", 
    "43": "Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was monitored postoperatively with pulse oximetry in 72 dental patients. Intravenous general anesthesia was employed in 57 patients. All of these patients received supplemental oxygen intraoperatively, and of these, 29 received supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Fifteen patients received only local anesthesia without supplemental oxygen and served as the control group. Continuous pulse oximetry revealed 43 episodes of arterial oxygen desaturation (SpO2 decreases greater than 3% from baseline) in patients who did not receive postanesthesia supplemental oxygen and eight episodes of desaturation in patients who did receive postanesthesia oxygen. Patients with a smoking history had more episodes of desaturation than did nonsmokers in the group that received general anesthesia and breathed room air postoperatively. The total amount of methohexital administered had no significant effect on the number of patients with desaturation episodes. These observations emphasize the need for postoperative oxygen for patients who undergo general anesthesia for outpatient oral and maxillofacial surgery.", 
    "44": "The unique distribution of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its receptors within the central nervous system, its pre-eminent role in mediating the endocrine, behavioural, autonomic and immunological effects of stress and its potent effects after direct administration into the CNS all support the hypothesis that alterations in CRF neuronal systems contribute to the pathophysiology of depression and certain anxiety disorders. This report summarizes a series of preclinical and clinical investigations which have sought to test the hypothesis that CRF-containing neurons show alterations in depression and anxiety, and that drugs used to treat these disorders alter CRF neuronal circuits. Direct injection of CRF into the locus ceruleus or nearby parabrachial nucleus evokes an anxiogenic response. Stress increases CRF concentrations in the locus ceruleus, whereas alprazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, decreases the concentration of the peptide in the same area. Clinical studies reveal that drug-free depressed patients show: (1) hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis; (2) increased CRF concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid; (3) a blunted release of ACTH in response to CRF; (4) a reduced density of CRF receptors in the frontal cortex; (5) pituitary and adrenal gland hypertrophy. These findings are all concordant with hypersecretion of CRF from hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic CRF neurons in depression.", 
    "45": "Sixty patients, undergoing minor gynaecologic procedures, were prospectively enrolled in this randomized study. They were anaesthetized with either propofol or midazolam supplemented or not with fentanyl or alfentanil. Respiratory depression was evaluated using repeated measurements of ventilatory response to CO2 (Read's method) during the preoperative period until the second postoperative hour. No respiratory depression was observed when propofol was used alone. By contrast, midazolam alone induced a significant respiratory depression during the first postoperative hour.", 
    "46": "Earlier work demonstrated that prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ) selectively affected the noradrenergic (NE) terminals in the hypothalamus, leading to decreased basal NE levels, turnover rate, and release in adult offspring as well as altered responses to stressors in these NE projections. The exposure also affected plasma hormonal responses to stressors. In the present work, we used immunocytochemistry to study the effects of prenatal DZ exposure on NE terminals and on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. DZ exposure (2.5 or 10 mg/kg over gestational days 14-20) led to a decrease in dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)-immunoreactivity (-ir) and a decrease in CRF-ir containing cells within the PVN of adult rats. The exposure also decreased DBH-ir in the ventral portion of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) but did not affect CRF-ir in the oval nucleus of BNST. Therefore, this study provides anatomic evidence that targeting benzodiazepine binding sites prenatally affects two neurotransmitter systems involved in responses to stressors.", 
    "47": "One hundred eighteen dogs were studied at three veterinary teaching hospitals after the administration of midazolam (0.1 mg/kg, intravenously [IV]) or a placebo. Midazolam and placebo treatments were randomized and blinded to the investigators. The dose of thiamylal required for tracheal intubation 3 to 5 minutes after midazolam or placebo was calculated. The dose of thiamylal at the three hospitals was 10.6, 9.8, and 10.1 mg/kg i.v. after midazolam, and 12.1, 11.2, and 11.6 mg/kg i.v. after placebo. Pooled data from the three hospitals yielded a significant (p < .001) decrease in mean IV thiamylal dose after midazolam (10.2 mg/kg) compared with placebo (11.6 mg/kg). Overall, there was a 12% decrease in the dose of thiamylal required for tracheal intubation after midazolam compared to that after the placebo. The thiamylal dose was significantly (p < .001) decreased after midazolam compared with placebo for dogs weighing more than 15 kg but not for dogs weighing less than 15 kg.", 
    "48": "Benzodiazepines have been regarded as relatively safe drugs but since triazolam was introduced into Denmark in 1978, six fatal cases of poisoning by triazolam alone or in combination with ethanol, have occurred in East Denmark. In one case where no ethanol was detected, a blood triazolam concentration of 0.11 mg/l was found. In another case in which blood was unavailable because of putrefaction, muscle was analyzed. In the four cases in which the ethanol concentration was in the range 110-202 mg/100 ml, the triazolam concentration range was 0.04-0.22 mg/l. Blood concentrations from these five cases were compared to those from living persons who had also ingested the drug, and these were in the range 0.002-0.03 mg/l (n = 28), with an average concentration of 0.01 mg/l.", 
    "49": "This report characterizes the cytochrome P450 isozyme involved in clonazepam metabolism. This study was undertaken using a library of liver microsomal fractions prepared from untreated rabbits or those treated with drugs known to specifically induce various cytochrome P450 isozymes (ie P450 2B4 by phenobarbital, P450 1A1 and P450 1A2 by 3-methylcholanthrene and beta-naphthoflavone, P450 2E1 by acetone and ethyl alcohol, and P450 3A6 by erythromycin). Only microsomes obtained from phenobarbital-treated rabbits exhibited a type II binding spectrum upon addition of clonazepam (Ks(app) = 31.4 +/- 3.8 microM) and significantly metabolized clonazepam to 7-aminoclonazepam. Benzphetamine, which is a known substrate for P450 2B1 was also extensively metabolized by microsomes prepared from phenobarbital treated rabbits. This indicates that the same isozyme (P450 2B subfamily) was involved in the biotransformation of both substrates. Experiments performed on 14 human liver microsomal preparations showed a wide interindividual variability (from 1-4) and a good correlation (r = 0.70) between benzphetamine and clonazepam metabolism. Since P450 3A4 (nf25) was involved in benzphetamine metabolism, clonazepam was probably nitroreduced by the same isozyme. An oligonucleotide specific for the P450 3A4 gene subfamily was synthetized and used for hybridization on total RNA from human liver samples. Two transcripts of 2.2 and 3.0 kb were detected and the level of the 2.2 kb mRNA expression was significantly correlated (r = 0.61) with the intensity of clonazepam nitroreduction by the corresponding microsome batches.", 
    "50": "In order to establish a profile of the abuser of dextropropoxyphene (DPX) in our community, we reviewed all the records from the Detoxification Unit in the Mental Health Institute in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. A total of 209 records were reviewed, and 73 were included in our study. Those included had a diagnosis of DPX dependence according to DSM-III-R and no associated psychiatric pathology. Most of them were single, unemployed males, with a history of at least 4 years of continuous DPX abuse. They were consuming an average dose per day 3.5 times higher than the maximum therapeutic dose recommended. The onset of generalized seizures associated with the DPX abuse was confirmed in 53% of the cases. The drug most frequently abused along with DPX was a benzodiazepine (p < .01), followed by marijuana, heroin, alcohol, stimulants (cocaine and amphetamines), and inhalants; 17% of the cases were pure DPX abusers. DPX was the first opiate ever abused in 67% of the cases, 19% had abused heroin before DPX, and 14% started the use of both at the same time. The difference among these groups (p < .01) suggests DPX as an opiate of primary abuse and not as secondary to heroin dependence.", 
    "51": "1. Carbachol produced a relaxation of dilator muscle at a concentration lower than 1 microM and a contraction at a concentration higher than 1 microM. 2. We studied the effects of the M1-selective antagonist, pirenzepine, the M2-selective antagonist, himbacine, the M3-selective antagonist, 4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and the non-selective antagonist, atropine, on carbachol-induced relaxation and contraction of the rat iris dilator smooth muscle. All the antagonists competitively inhibited both the responses to carbachol. 3. In relaxation and contraction, the low affinity of pirenzepine and himbacine suggest that the rat iris dilator smooth muscle receptors are not of the M1 and M2 subtypes. In contrast, 4-DAMP potently inhibited the carbachol-induced relaxation and contraction with affinities similar to those reported for the M3 subtype. 4. Carbachol-induced relaxation and contraction of the rat iris dilator appears to be mediated through a homogeneous population of M3 subtype.", 
    "52": "The authors report their experience with the use of loco-regional anaesthesia for the surgical treatment of inguinal and femoral hernias. Their series includes 1730 operations, 235 of which for hernia relapses, performed exclusively in the outpatient department. In the authors opinion, with loco-regional anaesthesia it is possible to treat any type of inguinal-femoral hernia, reducing the risks related to total anaesthesia and the complications arising from bedrid. Excellent results were achieved especially in the elderly and high risk patients like cardiopathic or those affected by respiratory and hepatorenal insufficiency with a complete absence of mortality and morbidity.", 
    "53": "Enhancers of the percutaneous diffusion of clonazepam in the isolated single-pass perfused rabbit ear were evaluated and included propylene glycol (PG), polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of different molecular weight, as well as skin pretreatment with lauryl alcohol (LA). PG caused a concentration-dependent increase in the diffusion of clonazepam, due partly to the increased solubility of the active principle in the hydrogel. PEGs of molecular weight up to 3,000 Daltons added to the PG hydrogel showed a simple additive effect on percutaneous diffusion enhancement induced by PG. Transdermal delivery of clonazepam also increased as a function of exposure time following pretreatment with LA.", 
    "54": "Buprenorphine was used as a preanesthetic drug for peridural anaesthesia. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate the sedative/anxiolitic activity of this drug as compared to prometazine and diazepam. Two hundred male patients, divided into two groups (A and B), who were to undergo urological surgery under peripheral anesthesia, were included in the study: L2/L3 or L3/L4 epidural block. The group A patients were premedicated with buprenorphine; the group B patients received traditional anesthetic. The following factors were evaluated: the course of the AP and CF, the state of intraoperative sedation, the presence of side effects and data obtained, elaborated with a statistical test constructed to compare the percentages in two independent samples. There were no statistically significant variations of the AP and CF in the two groups. Additional sedatives were administered to 56.2% of the patients in group B and to only 27.1% in group A, premedicated with buprenorphine. Thirty seven percent of the group A patients and 10% of the group B patients presented preoperative nausea. The authors believe that the buprenorphine/atrophine association should be encouraged for pre-anesthesia when operations in peridural anesthesia are to be conducted, as it provides a state of constant sedation, avoiding rather ineffective pharmacological mixtures.", 
    "55": "The effects of lorazepam (2 mg), oxazepam (30 mg) and placebo on performance in implicit and explicit memory tasks were compared in a double-blind, independent group study with 36 healthy volunteers. Both benzodiazepines (BZs) impaired performance on the explicit task (free recall). However, only lorazepam impaired performance of the implicit task (word-stem completion). A similar pattern of drug effects was observed on a secondary task which used different instructions at stimulus presentation. BZ effects on the explicit task were more associated with levels of sedation (indexed by finger tapping speed) than their effects on the implicit task. It is concluded that both BZs impair episodic memory but only lorazepam impairs priming.", 
    "56": "Opioid analgesics and other drugs interact through multiple mechanisms, resulting in pharmacological effects that depend upon the pharmacodynamic action studied, the interacting agents and the route of administration. Many interactions result from induction or inhibition of the hepatic cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase system. The elimination of opioids is largely dependent on hepatic metabolism, and drug interactions involving this mechanism can therefore be clinically significant. Antibiotics are often used concomitantly with opioids in patients undergoing medical or surgical procedures; the best documented metabolic interactions are with erythromycin and rifampicin (rifampin). Erythromycin increases and rifampicin decreases the effects of opioids. Cimetidine may increase the effects of opioids by increasing their duration of action; there have been no documented cases of interactions with ranitidine. Carbamazepine, phenytoin and the barbiturates can enhance the metabolism of opioids that rely on hepatic metabolism. Other pharmacokinetic interactions include those with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines and metoclopramide. Interactions involving pharmacodynamic mechanisms are more common than pharmacokinetic ones. Such interactions are manifested clinically as as a summation (additive or synergistic) of similar or opposing pharmacological effects on the same body system. Idiosyncratic interactions also occur, the mechanisms of which have not been proven to be solely modulated by either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic means. The knowledge of particular opioid-drug interactions, and the causative pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and idiosyncratic mechanisms, allows for the safer administration of opioid analgesics.", 
    "57": "The case of a 51 year old woman diagnosed with hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) requiring hospital admission on one occasion is presented. The patient was scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy of uterine myomas. Upon presentation to the authors, the patient was not under treatment and was asymptomatic. The patient was given 1000 units of C1-INH two hours prior to surgery. The operation was performed under peridural anesthesia to which no complications were presented. Specific treatment included: short term prophylaxis prior to surgery with C1-INH or fresh plasma and/or antifibrinolytic and hormonal agents. The authors considered that the locoregional techniques are elective to avoid tracheal intubation.", 
    "58": "This study was designed to document possible changes in bupivacaine kinetics in mice after a single 1 mg/kg injection of flumazenil. After a single 20 mg/kg i.p. dose of bupivacaine, C max, Vd, Cl and AUC were not significantly modified by flumazenil; even if T max was shown to be significantly shorter when flumazenil was associated, bupivacaine bioavailability did not seem to be modified and thus may not be involved in the explanation of previously reported increasing bupivacaine-induced mortality by flumazenil.", 
    "59": "Status epilepticus, particularly the convulsive form, is a medical emergency, warranting prompt and aggressive treatment. To do this, one must have a thorough understanding of the pharmacology of the anticonvulsant agents. Therapy should be directed toward rapid termination of the status epilepticus, prevention of seizure recurrence, and treatment of any underlying cause. Most importantly, one should establish and adhere to a standard treatment protocol for best results.", 
    "60": "Zolpidem, an imidazopyridine derivative, is a chemically novel, non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent. Many uraemic patients complain of sleep disorders and ask for hypnotic medication which is well tolerated both clinically and biologically in such patients. We studied the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolpidem in 12 end-stage renal patients regularly treated by hemodialysis three times a week. Zolpidem (10 mg) was given orally for 14 or 21 days. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations were repeated at the end of the study on day 14 or day 21. Cmax, Tmax, t1/2 and the area under the curve were not modified in hemodialyzed patients. After daytime dosing, zolpidem induced the same level of sleepiness after the first and last dose and was well tolerated as a hypnotic agent after the night-time dosing. From these results, it can be said that zolpidem may be administered safely to patients with severe renal impairment without any modification of the dosage regimen.", 
    "61": "The efficacy and safety of zolpidem, a hypnotic of a new chemical class (the imidazopyridines), was compared with a reference benzodiazepine in elderly insomniac patients in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial. Hospitalized patients aged 58 to 98 years were randomized to receive zolpidem 5 mg (70 patients), zolpidem 10 mg (74 patients), or triazolam 0.25 mg (77 patients) at bed-time. (Three patients were excluded and 13 patients did not complete the study.) The 3-week active treatment period was preceded by 3 and followed by 7 days of placebo administration. Sleep quality was assessed by the patient via a questionnaire and visual analog scale. A clinician's global impression was also recorded. All measures of sleep quality were improved by both doses of zolpidem and by triazolam. The improvements between the end of the placebo phase and the end of the active treatment phase were significant for all treatments and assessment instruments. Moreover, the significant improvements in all measures were maintained during the week following withdrawal of both doses of zolpidem. The improvement in most sleep assessment parameters was maintained after withdrawal of triazolam. Tolerability of all treatments was excellent. The majority of patients reported no adverse effects. The reported adverse effects in all groups included nightmares, daytime drowsiness, and day- or nighttime agitation. There was no evidence of rebound insomnia; the therapeutic effect of zolpidem outlasted drug treatment. There were no signs of agitation or anxiety following cessation of treatment, which might be indicative of withdrawal phenomena. Confusion was recorded only in the triazolam group. These results suggest that zolpidem is at least as effective as triazolam in geriatric insomniac patients. Zolpidem 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated a good safety profile. On the basis of these data, zolpidem 5 mg should be given as a starting dose in elderly patients, with a possible increase up to 10 mg in more severe cases of insomnia.", 
    "62": "The effects of intra-arterial injection of Temazepam are described in 11 drug abusers admitted over a 6 month period. All patients suffered severe ischaemia, and injection into the radial artery invariably resulted in tissue loss leading to amputation. The pathogenesis and options for treatment are discussed.", 
    "63": "Oral alimemazine and cisapride, or diazepam and cisapride, or iv midazolam and metoclopramide were given as premedication for small bowel biopsy to three groups of children from a total population of 185 individuals. The biopsy procedures were performed under intermittent fluoroscopy and times for both were recorded. The median biopsy procedure time was significantly shorter in children given iv midazolam and metoclopramide (6 min) compared to those given oral premedication (10 min) (p < 0.001). The median fluoroscopy time was very short in all groups, ranging between 3 and 6 s. It is concluded that iv premedication is superior to oral premedication for small bowel biopsy in children because more effective sedation is obtained.", 
    "64": "Toxicological analyses are presented in connection with the decrease of a 51-year-old female medical practitioner. The woman was found dead in a woodland about 250 metres far from her motor car. According to her relatives the woman had expressed her intention to commit suicide. Two single use syringes, two empty (300 units) cartridges intermediate type human insulin, and one empty ampoule of 10 mg diazepam were found near the corpse. The toxicological analyses of the heart-blood resulted in 210 ng diazepam/ml, 382 mu units/ml insulin and 0.58 ng/ml C-peptide. After extraction of a tissue sample from the injection area (cubital region) 113 milliunits insulin could be detected by radioimmunoassay. The insulin concentration in relation to the C-peptide concentration in the blood of the corpse indicated an exogenous supply of insulin. The HbA1c and fructosamine data in the blood and the histological examination of the pancreas showed that the woman had not suffered from diabetes.", 
    "65": "Mice given 1% alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in the drinking water for 5 weeks developed a hyperactive behavior characterized by uncontrolled running upon stimulation with noise. The running was followed by seizures and sometimes death. These behaviors are characteristic of audiogenic seizures. Strain differences in susceptibility to DFMO-induced audiogenic seizures were observed. The order of sensitivity to this DFMO effect was: C3HeB/FEJ = C3H/HeN > CBA/J = BALB/c. Chronic DFMO treatment was found to deplete whole brain putrescine and spermidine, but not spermine nor gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the 2 strains of mice analyzed, C3H/HeN and BALB/c. The audiogenic seizures were eliminated by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium) (40 mg/kg, ip) 105 minutes prior to testing for seizures.", 
    "66": "Primary cultures of dissociated cerebral cortex cells were used to characterize the muscarinic acetylcholinergic receptors (mAChR) present and to study receptor down-regulation and receptor mediated 2nd messenger responses induced by muscarinic agonists. Binding of the hydrophilic antagonist [3H]N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]NMS) to the cultured cells was saturated after one hour at 4 degrees C with a Kd of 93 pM and a Bmax of 958 fmol/mg protein. Competition binding studies with several antagonists and agonists indicated that the mAChR present in the culture were of a mixed M1/M3 subtype. The number of muscarinic receptors at the cell surface decreased by 60% after one hour pre-incubation of the cultures with 10 microM carbachol or oxotremorine. After down-regulation with carbachol affinity for pirenzepine was decreased, while low affinity sites for 4-DAMP were lost, indicating that especially M1 subtypes are sensitive to this type of regulation. Carbachol and oxotremorine-M induced a 2-3 fold increase in phosphatidyl inositide (PI) turnover, which was blocked with high affinity by both pirenzepine and 4-DAMP. Down-regulation of the mAChR and stimulation of PI-turnover by agonists with different potency and intrinsic activity appeared highly correlated. These data suggest that activation of the PI second-messenger system is involved in the desensitization and down-regulation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.", 
    "67": "Alcohol is used in most cultures despite knowledge of the physical, psychological and social problems associated with its abuse. Behavioural impairment is a function of several factors, including blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and the rate of alcohol metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase and the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system. Their availability and activity depend upon alcohol use history, ethnicity, other drug use and gender. Adverse social consequences related to alcohol intoxication include impaired driving, acts of aggression and violence towards self and others, and various types of accidents. About 40% of all fatal traffic accidents in Canada and the US in 1986-1987 were alcohol-related. Similar statistics have been reported in the UK and Europe (e.g. Sweden). The risk of a fatal car accident increases exponentially with a driver's BAC, prompting recommendations to lower the legal BAC limit for driving and piloting aircraft. Risks of falls, drownings, and fires and burns may also be increased by alcohol intoxication. At least 22% of work-related accidents may have involved alcohol use. These data are probably conservative estimates as under-reporting of alcohol use is likely. Alcohol facilitates aggressive behaviours, but it is difficult to separate the pharmacological effect from psychosocial effects or some other common factor (e.g. low CSF levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-H1AA have been reported in alcoholics, suicide attempters, violent offenders). In addition, alcohol interacts with other drugs to increase or decrease their behavioural and therapeutic effects. An acutely high BAC inhibits the metabolism of other CNS depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines), but long-term alcohol use increases the metabolism of most drugs. A potential amethystic agent, to block or reverse alcohol's effects, has been identified in preclinical studies (Ro15-4513, an imidazobenzodiazepine). Some clinical studies indicated that naloxone, lithium, ibuprofen, zimeldine and catecholamine agonists may reduce ethanol-induced behavioural or cognitive effects but the results have not been consistently replicated. More research is needed to determine the potential clinical use of amethystic agents and other pharmacotherapies in the prevention and treatment of problem behaviours associated with alcohol abuse and intoxication.", 
    "68": "The purpose of premedication and the best form have been frequent subjects of controversy among anaesthetists in the past few years. Anxiolysis is now accepted as the main purpose. The preferred route of administration is by mouth. The intention of this study was to examine whether clorazepate dipotassium has the same sedative-hypnotic and anxiolytic effects as i.m. premedication with promethazine, pethidine and atropine.", 
    "69": "A total of 100 patients aged 20-65 years and due to undergo arthroscopy took part in this study. Patients in group I were given 1 mg flunitrazepam p.o. on the evening before the operation and the i.m. premedication described above. The premedication for group II consisted in clorazepate dipotassium, 50 mg on the evening before operation and 25 mg on the morning of the day of the operation. The sedative-hypnotic effects were measured on a four-point scale. The Erlangen anxiety scale (EAS) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) were used to evaluate the anxiolytic effects according to the patient's own and the observer's evaluation of mood. In addition to this, we measured amnesia, heart rate and blood pressure.", 
    "70": "Clorazepate dipotassium or flunitrazepam p.o. significantly reduces anxiety 1 h after administration as measured by the EAS (P < 0.05) on the evening before the operation. This result was not, however, confirmed by the VAS for self-assessment. Patients who received premedication with clorazepate dipotassium are less anxious on the morning of the operation than patients given flunitrazepam the evening before the operation (P < 0.05); this, however, does not correspond to the VAS results. There were no differences in the other parameters compared.", 
    "71": "Oral premedication with clorazepate dipotassium has the same sedative-hypnotic, anxiolytic and amnestic effects as i.m. premedication with promethazine, pethidine and atropine. The results of this study are better than those obtained by Tolksdorf et al., owing to the higher dosage used in our study (50 mg as against 20 mg). Tolksdorf et al. [21] failed to show any improvement on a placebo. Our results correspond to those of Drautz et al. [2] who used 50 mg of clorazepate dipotassium on the evening before and 25 mg on the morning of the day of the operation.", 
    "72": "Alfentanil-midazolam analgesic interactions were studied in rats with continuous infusions or bolus injections of the drugs. Analgesia was determined by measuring the threshold of motor response to noxious pressure. The continuous constant-rate infusion of alfentanil demonstrated that after an initial peak, the analgesia profoundly declined due to the development of acute tolerance. When alfentanil (250 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) was given together with midazolam (3 mg.kg-1.h-1), the decline in the analgesic effect of alfentanil was attenuated. Following the 4 h period of the constant-rate (250 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) infusion of alfentanil, when acute tolerance was already developed, midazolam (3 mg.kg-1) given as a bolus injection enhanced the alfentanil-induced anesthesia. At the same time, when alfentanil was given as a bolus injection (30 micrograms.kg-1) with or without midazolam (3 mg.kg-1) also by bolus injection, no changes were seen to indicate an enhancement of the analgesic effect of alfentanil by midazolam. The results suggest that midazolam attenuates the development of acute tolerance to the analgesic effect of alfentanil.", 
    "73": "Although benzodiazepine medication is generally considered to be inappropriate for patients with obstructive sleep apnea, further investigation is required to evaluate this. Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics may improve sleep quality without causing respiratory depression. In central sleep apnea, hypnotics not only improve sleep but also decrease apnea frequency probably by reducing arousals and elevating arterial PCO2. Consequently, I submit that the statement 'hypnotics should not be used in patients with sleep apnea' should be changed to 'hypnotics may sometimes be used in patients with sleep apnea'.", 
    "74": "There is limited information on the time course of recovery of sleep architecture in patients withdrawn from benzodiazepines (BDZ). This study examined the effects of substituting a new class of hypnotic drugs, namely the cyclopyrrolones, for current BDZs in patients presenting with BDZ dependence. The results indicated a clear improvement in a variety of sleep parameters after commencing with a cyclopyrrolone (zopiclone). These changes remained to some extent after zopiclone was discontinued. Also, the absence of certain withdrawal effects (i.e. rebound insomnia) upon discontinuation of zopiclone allows for patients to be carried through a potentially difficult period after stopping BDZs, while expediting the eventual discontinuation of all hypnotic medication.", 
    "75": "Morbid obesity affects 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and poses challenging problems to the anesthesiologist during the perioperative period. We present a unique case of the management of a morbidly obese woman complicated by a massive ovarian cyst. The major cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and technical features special to this patient population are discussed.", 
    "76": "To validate the superiority of higher-dose oral midazolam as an anesthetic premedicant in children 6 years of age and younger, to determine whether less expensive diazepam is a viable alternative oral premedicant in this age-group, and to assess the preoperative oxygenation effects of both benzodiazepines.", 
    "77": "A prospective, randomized, double-blind study.", 
    "78": "Outpatient surgery department and operating room (OR) of a freestanding children's hospital.", 
    "79": "Seventy-five ASA physical status I and II outpatients 1 to 6 years of age.", 
    "80": "Patients were randomized to receive either midazolam 0.6 mg/kg, diazepam 0.3 mg/kg, or a placebo orally in a timely manner prior to surgery.", 
    "81": "Each child's subsequent reaction to separation from his or her parents in the presurgical holding area was scored on a three-point behavioral scale. Once in the OR, an initial room air oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) was obtained. Each child's initial acceptance of the anesthetic induction mask was then scored on a four-point scale. No significant differences in parental separation scores, initial room air SpO2, or postanesthesia care unit admission time were observed among the three study groups. However, both midazolam and diazepam were observed to be superior to the placebo in facilitating the initial acceptance of the anesthetic induction mask.", 
    "82": "Even without premedication, a majority of children did not react negatively to an impending anesthetic. Therefore, neither midazolam nor diazepam appears to be necessary in most children younger than 6 years of age. Rather than implementing the routine use of an oral preoperative sedative, the challenge appears to be the selective identification of those children at risk for preanesthetic difficulties and psychological trauma.", 
    "83": "A 39 year-old man with malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum received 3500 mg mefloquine over 3 days, in addition to 3250 mg chloroquine and 175/3500 mg sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. He developed severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and had to be hospitalized. Treatment with diazepam, haloperidol and thioridazine achieved relief of the severe symptoms after 4 days. The patient was still suffering from discrete neuropsychiatric symptoms 8 months after treatment.", 
    "84": "Female rats have been found much more sensitive to lethal effects of soman than male rats. Therefore it was of interest to examine the efficacy of different antidotes against soman poisoning in females which are usually not being used in soman poisoning studies. The effects of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) non-reactivating antidotes atropine and diazepam were analyzed in combination with physostigmine prophylaxis against supralethal doses of soman. Physostigmine prophylaxis was much more effective when supplemented by atropine and diazepam therapy, applied at the onset of the first signs of poisoning. The interval between the injection of a supralethal dose of soman and the appearance of signs of poisoning was shorter in physostigmine pretreated animals than in non-pretreated controls poisoned with the same supralethal dose of soman. The prophylactic effect of physostigmine (used at maximal dose) disappeared in about 120 min. The addition of HI-6, an AChE-reactivating oxime, to atropine + diazepam therapy further increased the survival in soman-poisoned and physostigmine-pretreated rats, yielding the highest protective ratio of 6.4. Pretreatment with physostigmine offered marked protection against inhibition of AChE by soman, as shown by enzyme activity determination in different brain regions and in diaphragm muscle. Application of HI-6 in addition to the combination of the above mentioned antidotes even preserved more AChE activity in the skeletal muscle but did not influence inhibition of the enzyme in brain.", 
    "85": "Clinical trials with muscarinic agonists or acetylcholine esterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia have shown disappointing or equivocal results. An alternative treatment of this disease is the development of drugs which enhance the release of acetylcholine. It is believed, that of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes so far identified in the brain, M2 receptors are located presynaptically in the cortex and hippocampus and upon stimulation inhibit the release of acetylcholine. Based on this hypothesis, we initiated a drug discovery program with the aim of identifying selective and centrally active M2 antagonists which are capable of enhancing cholinergic transmission. These efforts resulted in the successful design and synthesis of novel muscarinic antagonists able to cross the blood brain barrier. Moreover, these compounds show few peripheral effects and possess a superior M2 versus M1 selectivity. The prototype of this novel class of M2 selective compounds, BIBN 99, could be a valuable tool to test the hypothesis that lipophilic M2 antagonists show beneficial effects in the treatment of cognitive disorders.", 
    "86": "High overnight plasma growth hormone (GH) levels in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are reflected in both an increase in the GH pulse amplitude and elevated baseline GH concentrations. To determine whether these are a result of an increase in GH secretory episodes, we undertook deconvolution analysis of overnight GH profiles using previously determined half-life data.", 
    "87": "Deconvolution of overnight GH profiles (2000-0800 h) was undertaken from normal and diabetic adolescents (either on their usual insulin regime (n = 15), during overnight euglycaemic clamp using a variable rate insulin infusion (n = 29), or during clamp plus 100 mg pirenzepine to suppress endogenous GH (n = 7)).", 
    "88": "Thirty-five normal and 29 diabetic adolescents of both sexes at all stages of puberty.", 
    "89": "GH secretory rates were calculated from deconvolution analysis, and Fourier transformation was increased mean overnight GH secretion when analysed by sex and by puberty stage compared to normal subjects; overnight GH secretion median (range) of diabetic group 1.88 (0.56-3.81) mU/min; control group 0.62 (0.32-1.92) mU/min (P < 0.001). Fourier transform analysis of these secretory episodes showed greater pulse frequency in the diabetics with dominant pulse periodicity of 90 minutes compared with 135 minutes in normal subjects. During overnight euglycaemia, mean +/- SEM overnight GH secretory rates were comparable to subjects' usual regime night (1.82 +/- 0.33 vs 1.91 +/- 0.37 mU/min) and there was no change in the dominant pulse periodicity of 90 minutes. Pirenzepine administration in diabetic subjects significantly reduced overnight GH secretion from 1.57 +/- 0.19 to 0.71 +/- 0.80 mU/min (P < 0.001) showing a median (range) reduction of 63 (9.3-82.8)% when compared to the subjects' clamp night. However, dominant pulse periodicity was not altered by pirenzepine administration, and remained at 90 minutes.", 
    "90": "In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus there is an increase in both the amplitude and frequency of pulsatile GH secretion compared to normal subjects, which is not affected by maintenance of overnight normoglycaemia. The anticholinergic drug pirenzepine appears to suppress the amplitude of GH pulse secretion but has no effect on frequency.", 
    "91": "The acute onset of chorea was seen in a ten week-old male following abrupt cessation of a seven-day course of sedation with diazepam and pentobarbital. These movements slowly resolved over a six-day period and the infant was without neurologic sequelae one week after his chorea resolved. A cerebral MRI was normal. We speculate that the mechanism by which chorea may occur as a withdrawal phenomenon to benzodiazepine/barbiturate treatment is by a functional overactivity of the dopaminergic system in the basal ganglia.", 
    "92": "Considerable evidence indicates that dopamine (DA) may play a neurotoxic role in brain in certain pathologic circumstances. To investigate this issue, dopamine (1000 nmol/1 microliter) was directly injected into the striatum of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Control animals received equal-volume injections of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or NaCl at identical concentrations (diluted in distilled H2O, pH 7.0-7.7). Brains were removed 7 to 9 days later and frozen or fixed and sectioned for histologic and autoradiographic analysis. Dopamine injection resulted in a small-volume (3.3-mm3) lesion in comparison to control GABA and NaCl injections which produced only a needle track < 0.6 mm3 in volume (P < 0.01). Dose dependency of DA toxicity was demonstrated, with substantial parenchymal damage requiring an injection of 500 nmol/1 microliter. Within the lesion, marked neuronal loss, macrophage invasion, and capillary and glial proliferation were present. Acetylcholinesterase staining and D1 receptor binding were markedly reduced as well. [3H]RO5-4864 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (on astrocytes) was increased in the periphery of the lesion. The binding of 1-[3H]benzo[b]cyclohexylthiophenylpiperidine to dopamine uptake sites was also reduced, but over a wider striatal area in comparison to local parenchymal damage. Prior interruption of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway (by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine) appeared to potentiate the toxicity of intrastriatal dopamine injection. The findings indicate that local injection of dopamine produces both post- and presynaptic damage to nigrostriatal structures, and support the contention that dopamine may act as a low-potency neurotoxin.", 
    "93": "Thirty-two women underwent major gynaecological surgery with a midazolam-alfentanil total i.v. anaesthetic regimen. Adequacy of anaesthesia was assessed using a \"pressure, rate, sweating and tears\" (PRST) scoring system in conjunction with the isolated forearm technique (IFT). The IFT revealed that 72% of patients responded during surgery, but none had spontaneous, unprompted postoperative recall for the event. Three patients, on prompting, provided evidence of recall. The IFT, while indicating which patients are responsive, cannot be used to predict who will have postoperative recall. Lack of explicit postoperative recall does not indicate unconsciousness during surgery. Twenty patients, asked specifically during surgery to indicate the presence or absence of pain, experienced pain at some time during their surgical procedure. The PRST score could not be used to predict when a patient was awake. This low-dose i.v. anaesthetic technique cannot be recommended for general use.", 
    "94": "We have measured in 38 patients the plasma concentration profile of atracurium and its effect on the electromyographic first response of the train-of-four. One of three techniques was used to supplement anaesthesia with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen, 0.9% isoflurane (end-tidal), 0.5% halothane (end-tidal) or midazolam 3-10 mg. A four-parameter threshold pharmacodynamic model was fitted to the data in each patient. Compared with a group of patients anaesthetized with an i.v. technique, the steady-state plasma concentration producing 50% block (Cpss50) was reduced by halothane, and to a greater extent by isoflurane. The rate constant for exit from the effect compartment (k(eo)) correlated negatively with age and was greater in female patients, but unaffected by anaesthetic technique. The values of gamma, the slope of the concentration-response curve, and of the threshold (Cpss theta) were not affected significantly by age, sex or anaesthetic technique.", 
    "95": "The dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) is a well-known region for processing defensive behavior in the brainstem. Rats implanted with cannulae in the DPAG were submitted to the elevated plus-maze test for 5 min. The effects of morphine following systemic (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) or DPAG administration (5-30 nmol) were compared with the benzodiazepine compound midazolam injected similarly (1-10 mg/kg, IP, and 10-80 nM, DPAG). Morphine and midazolam caused dose-dependent increases in the number of entries and time spent in the open arms. A systemic injection of naloxone in doses that block mu-opioid receptors reversed the effects of centrally administered morphine. Higher doses of morphine (70 nmol) induced a non-naloxone-reversible \"fearful\" hyperreactivity. It is suggested that low doses of morphine inhibit the neural substrate of aversion in the DPAG, probably through activation of mu-receptors, and that microinjections of higher doses of morphine cause proaversive actions not mediated by these opioid receptors.", 
    "96": "The Syva ETS is an automated system designed for analysis of drugs of abuse in urine. Recently, the Syva Company has upgraded this system to the ETS Plus, which is capable of analyzing ethanol in urine, serum, or plasma. We evaluated the new ETS Plus for urine screening of barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine metabolite, opiates, and phencyclidine. Results of 505 patient sample assays obtained by ETS Plus were compared with those of ETS. There were only four discrepant results which had absorbance rates close to the low calibrator cutoff values. The within-run precision of the ETS Plus Ethyl Alcohol Assay yielded a CV of 2.6% at a target value of 1.00 g/L (1.06 +/- 0.03 g/L, n = 32) and a CV of 3.2% at a target value of 0.40 g/L (0.42 +/- 0.01 g/L, n = 30). The linear regression analysis of 30 patient serum ethanol results by the ETS Plus and by gas chromatography yielded y = 0.939 x + 0.03 g/L. The software modifications in the new ETS Plus allow the accurate quantitation of ethanol in serum and reliable detection of drugs of abuse within the same batch.", 
    "97": "Rebound insomnia, a worsening of sleep difficulty beyond baseline levels, can complicate the physician's attempt to use regularly scheduled drug holidays in the management of insomniac patients. Quazepam, a benzodiazepine with a long half-life, has been shown to exhibit carryover effectiveness for the first night or two following withdrawal. This finding suggests a potential utility for an alternate-night drug regimen in which the withdrawal features of the compound serve as a potential benefit.", 
    "98": "A randomized, double-blind, three-compartment, parallel-group design of 5 weeks' duration, comparing quazepam 15 mg, triazolam 0.5 mg, and placebo, was conducted in 65 insomniac subjects. This study was a nonpolysomnographic study utilizing sleep questionnaires.", 
    "99": "No differences were noted between quazepam and triazolam on treatment nights. Evidence of carryover effectiveness with quazepam and rebound effects with triazolam were noted on off-treatment nights.", 
    "100": "The efficiency of alternate-night therapy with quazepam should be rigorously evaluated using polysomnographic determinations.", 
    "101": "Atypical panic attacks include features such as focal paresthesias or sensory distortions, but attempts to demonstrate a relationship to partial seizures have been unsuccessful. Two patients with atypical panic attacks had attacks during EEG monitoring: one during a routine EEG in the EEG laboratory, the other at home during ambulatory monitoring. Focal paroxysms of sharp wave activity appeared on both patients' EEGs coincident with the spontaneous onset of panic attack symptoms. Both patients remained conscious. The correlation of focal paroxysmal EEG changes with panic attack symptoms suggests that these attacks were produced by partial seizure activity. Further study of the relationship between panic attacks and seizures is indicated."
