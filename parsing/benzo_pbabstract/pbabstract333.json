    "0": "Patients experiencing a first seizure need a careful history and examination to confirm that the presenting seizure is truly the initial event and to identify other possible risk factors for recurrence. The decision of whether to start therapy should be made by the clinician and a fully informed patient. Status epilepticus presents in several forms, with generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) being the most dramatic. Management of GCSE requires life support and monitoring measures as well as timely administration of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to terminate the seizure and reduce the risks for morbidity and mortality. Benzodiazepines, phenytoin, and phenobarbital can all be used to treat GCSE. Clinicians need to be familiar with the dosage and administration, adverse events, time to onset, and duration of action of these drugs. Should seizures continue or recur despite AED administration, induction of coma with pentobarbital may be considered. This must be done with continuous EEG and other physiologic monitoring in an intensive care unit. Additional assessment of the patient who has experienced GCSE focuses on identification of the underlying cause.",

    "2": "Patients with epilepsy may experience ARS episodes despite optimal anticonvulsant treatment. Such episodes require rapid treatment as medical emergencies. Typically, the patient is treated in an emergency medical setting with i.v. medication by trained medical personnel.", 
    "3": "The authors undertook a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind study of a single administration of Diastat (diazepam rectal gel) for treating episodes of ARS. ARS episodes and treatment criteria were defined for each patient at the start of the study. Caregivers were taught to determine ARS episode onset, administer a predetermined dose of study medication, monitor outcome, count respirations, and record seizures and adverse events.", 
    "4": "A total of 29 centers enrolled 158 patients, of whom 114 patients had a treated ARS episode (Diastat, n = 56; placebo, n = 58). Diastat treatment reduced median seizure frequency (p = 0.029). More Diastat patients were seizure free post-treatment (Diastat, 55%; placebo, 34%; p = 0.031). Kaplan-Meier analysis of the time to the next seizure favored Diastat treatment (p < 0.007). The most common adverse event was somnolence.",

    "6": "The authors tested in 101 patients the clinical effect of Myolastan (tetrazepam), generic name 1,4, benzodiazepine (BZD), in indications with increased muscular tonus of varying etiology. The drug has a balanced affinity to central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, it enhances the presynaptic inhibition of GABAergig neurones at the peripheral and supraspinal level. Clinical experience has shown that a decline of the increased muscular tonus in the affected segment mitigates subjective complaints, in particular pain, if the dosage and time of administration are adjusted for every individual patient. A favourable effect was proved during clinical administration to a heterogeneous group of patients which reflects the spectrum of our ambulatory patients with a locally increase muscle tonus. In addition to vertebrogenic complaints, non-discogenic and discogenic (proved by MR or CT), the group of patients comprised also some with multiple sclerosis. In the latter a favourable effect was recorded in 50%. The effect on spasticity in these patients was comparable with other drugs used by the patients before administration of Myolastan. The heterogeneous group of the remaining patients to whom Myolastan was administered suggests its possible further indications, without the possibility of significant conclusions. Possible side-effects could be eliminated by the administration of low doses in the evening or at night. Myolastan extends the range of drugs which have an impact on an increased muscular tonus.", 
    "7": "This paper reports a simple, expeditious procedure for confirming the presence of benzodiazepines in previously screened positive urine samples. Samples are manually hydrolysed to the corresponding benzophenones in an acid medium. The hydrolysis products are continuously aspirated into a photometric flow system for screening; positive samples are then confirmed and benzodiazepines identified by using a different flow system that conditions the analytes for gas chromatographic separation and unequivocal mass spectrometric confirmation. Detection limits for benzodiazepines in the nanogram-per-millilitre region are thus achieved by using 0.5 ml of hydrolysed urine; also, repeatability, as R.S.D., is less than 6.5%. The high specificity and sensitivity of the proposed method enables the confirmation of different benzodiazepines in urine samples obtained from drug addicts and patients from a local hospital.", 
    "8": "As a measurement of the level of anxiety in psychiatric outpatients with anxiety, we determined the saliva level of free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyleglycol (MHPG) using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry and scored the levels of anxiety with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS) in patients, before and after drug treatment with alprazolam for 1 week. The saliva level of free-MHPG at first visit to hospital was significantly higher than that of control individuals and disease control individuals and was reduced by alprazolam treatment for 1 week. There was no correlation between MHPG level and the HAS score at the first hospital visit. The MHPG levels after treatment correlated with the HAS scores. The reduction of the anxiety level as scored by the HAS correlated with the reduction of MHPG level. These results indicate that the free saliva MHPG level may be a useful indicator for assessing not only the level of anxiety, but also the response to drug treatment for anxiety in these patients.", 
    "9": "Chronic low level lead (Pb) exposure is associated with decrements in renal function in humans, but the molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity are not understood. We investigated cytosolic Pb-binding proteins (PbBP) in kidney of environmentally-exposed humans to identify molecular targets of Pb and elucidate mechanisms of toxicity. This study is unique in that it localized PbBPs based on physiologic Pb that was bound in vivo. Two Pb-binding polypeptides were identified, thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4, 5 kDa) and acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP, 9 kDa, also known as diazepam binding inhibitor, DBI). These polypeptides, which have not been previously recognized for their metal-binding capabilities, were shown to bind Pb with high affinity (Kd approximately 14 nM) and to account for an estimated > 35% of the total Pb in kidney cortex tissue. Both T beta 4 and ACBP (DBI) occur across animal species from invertebrates to mammals and in all major tissues, serving multiple possible functions (e.g. regulation of actin polymerization, calmodulin-dependent enzyme activity, acyl-CoA metabolism, GABA-A/benzodiazepine receptor modulation, steroidogenesis, etc.). Thus, these data provide the first evidence of specific molecular targets of Pb in kidney of environmentally-exposed humans, and they suggest that low-level Pb toxicity may occur via alteration of T beta 4 and ACBP (DBI) function in renal and other tissues, including the central nervous system.", 
    "10": "The effects of triazolam on cognitive function and vigilance on the morning following a nocturnal administration were investigated using event-related potentials (ERP) measurement and a sleep latency test (SLT). We previously reported a significant reducing effect on target N1 amplitude on the morning following triazolam administration, suggesting a residual effect of triazolam. In order to demonstrate, which aspect of cognitive function alteration caused the reducing effect on N1 amplitude, we added the ignore condition for ERP measurement, which enabled us to separate mismatch negativity (MMN) from other subcomponents overlapping N1. As a result, MMN was attenuated and sleep latency was shortened on the morning following triazolam administration. Two possibilities were suggested for the mechanism of MMN attenuation. One is GABAergic activation caused by the residual effect of triazolam per se, and the other is the lowered vigilance level demonstrated in the SLT. Further studies are necessary to determine whether this alteration in physiological bases underlying mismatch detection is specific to triazolam and/or other benzodiazepines or related to nonspecific vigilance level.", 
    "11": "In the present paper we describe the presence in avian CNS of an endogenous inhibitor of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. This compound was extracted from a synaptic membrane fraction isolated from chick optic lobe and brain using an exhaustive aqueous washing procedure, then purified by means of solid-phase extraction with C18 cartridges and several HPLC steps until an homogeneous peak was obtained. Its chemical structure was studied by size-exclusion chromatography of the purified material which indicated that it possesses a molecular weight below 1350. Although its inhibitory activity was lost by HCl treatment, its peptidic nature was ruled out by an amino acid and N-terminal sequence analyses. Ultraviolet absorption spectrum showed two main peaks at 230 and 280 nm. The endogenous compound was found to inhibit competitively [3H]flunitrazepam binding to its recognition site without affecting [3H]GABA binding to the same receptor complex. The behavior of the endogenous factor in an \"in vitro\" GABA \"shift\" test and GABA-dependent chloride flux experiments were similar to that of benzodiazepine receptor agonists. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the existence in avian CNS of a competitive endogenous inhibitor of benzodiazepine binding with agonistic action on benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "12": "In the rat cerebellar slice preparation in vitro, excessive DL-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-receptor activation elicits a characteristic type of excitotoxicity of Purkinje cells (PCs) known as dark cell degeneration (DCD). DCD models neurotoxicity of PCs and hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vivo following hyperexcitable states. The intent of this study was to: a) determine whether AMPA-induced neurotoxicity of PCs is correlated with temporally and spatially restricted rises in intracellular Ca2+ and b) whether GYKI 52466 and nominal external Ca2+, conditions that reduced expression of AMPA-elicited DCD, altered the induced Ca2+ patterns. Employing the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-3 and a confocal laser scanning microscope, we evaluated changes in intracellular Ca2+ within PCs in a cerebellar slice preparation. AMPA application alone (30 microM for 30 min) caused a significant initial rise in perinuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ that returned to control levels during the latter part of the AMPA exposure period. Following removal of AMPA (expression period), perinuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ displayed a significant delayed rise peaking transiently 60 min after AMPA removal. The efficacy of GYKI 52466 and nominal external Ca2+ conditions to attenuate AMPA-induced DCD was correlated to reductions in AMPA-induced transient elevations in perinuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels during the expression phase and to a lesser extent during the exposure period. The present data suggest that during the expression phase, the delayed perinuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ transient may be the harbinger of impending loss of Ca2+ homeostasis and cell damage.", 
    "13": "Bupivacaine is a commonly used local anesthetic in dental, ophthalmologic, and simple surgical procedures. Its current popularity derives from its potency and relatively long half-life. Widespread use of bupivacaine has resulted in sometimes severe adverse reactions when significant systemic absorption has occurred.

    "15": "They measured the distribution volume of benzodiazepine receptors in 11 recently detoxified patients with type II alcoholism and 11 healthy comparison subjects. The tracer was given as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion to achieve sustained binding equilibrium at the benzodiazepine receptors. Data were analyzed by using a region of interest method (regions of interest were identified on coregistered magnetic resonance imaging scans) and by a pixel-by-pixel method (distribution volume maps were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping for between-group differences).", 
    "16": "The region of interest analysis revealed that alcoholic patients had significantly lower benzodiazepine distribution volume than comparison subjects in the frontal, anterior cingulate, and cerebellar cortices. Statistical parametric mapping revealed two large excursions in which the distribution volume in alcoholic patients was significantly lower than in comparison subjects: the anterior cingulate, extending into the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left occipital cortex.", 
    "17": "Benzodiazepine receptor distribution volume is significantly lower in several cortical regions and the cerebellum in alcoholic subjects than in healthy comparison subjects. These results are consistent with previous reports and might indicate either a toxic effect of alcoholism on benzodiazepine receptors or a vulnerability factor for developing alcoholism.", 
    "18": "There have been diverse reports on the effects of diazepam on cardiac contractility. The purpose of this study was to examine whether diazepam modifies the inotropic response elicited by histamine on an isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle. The responses of electrically driven papillary muscle to histamine and cyclic AMP-related inotropic agents were recorded in the absence and in the presence of diazepam. Histamine and forskolin, which directly stimulate adenylate cyclase, significantly increased the contractile force in the papillary muscle in a concentration-dependent manner. A histaminergic H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine, but not a H1-receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, at 10 microM produced a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for histamine. Diazepam (10 microM) shifted the concentration-response curve for histamine and forskolin to the left by 1.8 and 1.6 times, respectively. Neither a central type (fulmazenil) nor a peripheral type (PK11195) of benzodiazepine receptor antagonist modified the effect of diazepam on the histaminergic-evoked contraction. Phosphodiesterase blockade by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine shifted the concentration-dependent curve for histamine to the left. A combination of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine also produced a leftward shift of the curve. However, there was no significant difference between the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine only group and the combination group. These results indicate that diazepam potentiates the positive inotropic effect produced by histamine, probably mediated via an increase in cyclic AMP levels induced by histamine.", 
    "19": "Disposition of diazepam (DZ) 2 mg/kg after single bolus intravenous (i.v.) and rectal (p.r.) administration before and after 30 day oral phenobarbital therapy was investigated in normal dogs. Adverse cardiovascular and neurologic effects for each drug, dosage and route of administration were evaluated. Plasma benzodiazepine concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. This assay measured DZ and its active metabolites, oxazepam and nordiazepam to provide a total benzodiazepine concentration. Mean peak plasma concentrations after i.v. administration were 5963 and 5565 ng/mL, before and after phenobarbital treatment, respectively. After p.r. administration, mean peak concentrations were 629 ng/mL and 274 ng/mL and were reached within 30 min before and after phenobarbital treatment, respectively. The target concentration for potential seizure control (i.e. 150 ng/mL) was attained in five dogs in the post phenobarbital p.r. group with a median time to attainment of target concentration of 8 min. The administration of phenobarbital resulted in significantly lower areas under the plasma concentration vs. time curves (AUC) for both i.v. and p.r. administration. Similarly, there was a reduction in maximal plasma concentration, bioavailability (F), mean residence time, and time to target and peak concentrations in the postphenobarbital p.r. group, as compared to the prephenobarbital p.r. group. Adverse cardiovascular and neurologic effects were short-lived and were considered of minor clinical significance. Overall, chronic phenobarbital therapy in the dog reduces total benzodiazepine concentration after i.v. and p.r. administration presumably due to increased hepatic clearance of DZ and its metabolites oxazepam and nordiazepam. Despite this finding, administration of DZ rectally at 2 mg/kg may be a clinically useful alternative to i.v. administration to treat emergency seizures when i.v. therapy is not possible in dogs on chronic phenobarbital therapy.",

This review considers the efficacy of irreversible and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, high-potency benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers and presents the response rates for each of these classes. Aspects of the social anxiety syndrome that are sensitive to drug treatment are discussed, and the data relating to relapse following treatment discontinuation are presented.

    "21": "To investigate the role of cholecystokininB (CCKB) receptors in the brain in the control of food intake, we administered PD-135158, a specific and potent CCKB antagonist, into the lateral ventricle of male, Sprague-Dawley rats 30 min before a 60-min intake test. PD-135158 (0.001-0.5 mg) increased intake significantly; the mean peak increase was 39% more than the intake after vehicle treatment. The increased intake was due to a larger first meal and more intake during the last 30 min of the test. Because intake during the first 3 min, a measure of palatability or orosensory stimulation did not change significantly, we suggest that antagonism of brain CCK at central CCKB receptors decreased the satiating potency of the ingested food during the meal and decreased the potency of the mechanisms that prevent the reinitiation of eating during the postprandial intermeal interval.",

Typical neuroleptic medications cannot be used for suppressing hallucinosis because the extrapyramidal side effects worsen parkinsonian motor control.

The introduction of a hydrophilic substituent group into the 5-position of the benzodiazepine ring resulted in an increase in oral availability. Especially, the (3-pyridyl)methyl (31b), the 2-(4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)-2-oxoethyl (32i), and the 2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl (33g) derivatives exhibited high antagonist activities and high oral availability.

    "31": "To describe the effect of endogenous dopamine on [11C]raclopride binding, we previously extended the conventional receptor ligand model to include dynamic changes in neurotransmitter concentration. Here, we apply the extended model in simulations of neurotransmitter competition studies using either bolus or bolus-plus-infusion (B/I) tracer delivery. The purpose of this study was (1) to develop an interpretation of the measured change in tracer binding in terms of underlying neurotransmitter changes, and (2) to determine tracer characteristics that maximize sensitivity to neurotransmitter release. A wide range of kinetic parameters was tested based on existing reversible positron emission tomography tracers. In simulations of bolus studies, the percent reduction in distribution volume (deltaV) caused by a neurotransmitter pulse was calculated. For B/I simulations, equilibrium was assumed, and the maximum percent reduction in tissue concentration (deltaC) after neurotransmitter release was calculated. Both deltaV and deltaC were strongly correlated with the integral of the neurotransmitter pulse. The values of deltaV and deltaC were highly dependent on the kinetic properties of the tracer in tissue, and deltaV could be characterized in terms of the tissue free tracer concentration. The value of deltaV was typically maximized for binding potentials of approximately 3 to 10, with deltaC being maximized at binding potentials of approximately 1 to 2. Both measures increased with faster tissue-to-blood clearance of tracer and lower nonspecific binding. These simulations provide a guideline for interpreting the results of neurotransmitter release studies and for selecting radiotracers and experimental design.",

The extraction of diazepam from the five brands of spiked and simulated cold drinks was carried out at pH 8.5 by two different extraction solvents viz., diethylether and chloroform. The identification of diazepam was done on the basis of RF values and in situ UV spectra. The quantitation was carried out by densitometric scanning of the chromatogram at a wavelength of 230 nm. The method is rapid and reliable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of cold drinks adulterated with diazepam and can be used by law enforcement laboratories for routine analysis.", 
    "33": "The notion of stabilization in schizophrenia has been investigated, in France, through a survey of 875 psychiatrists. This survey, which has been conducted on the 9th, 10th and 11th of December 1997, looked into the clinical, therapeutic and socio-demographic variables, and the means of patient management, which are used by psychiatrists to ascertain that their patients are stabilized. The data was collected by each psychiatrist by way of a questionnaire administered to his or her next three patients, either at the hospital or in private practice (2,464 questionnaires were completed).", 
    "34": "65% of the patients seen during this survey were considered stabilized by their psychiatrist (n = 1,597). The most common clinical presentation was of the parano\u00efd type. An insiduous onset of disease seems to be correlated with an absence of stabilization. Stabilization appears to be estimated at a given time rather than over a time period, since over half the patients who were considered stabilized had suffered at least one relapse over the last 2 years, and had been rehospitalized an average of 2.4 times over that period. In terms of drug therapy, they received 1.4 neuroleptic drugs, which does not differ markedly from the 1.5 neuroleptics administered to patients who were considered non stabilized. Co-prescriptions of anticholinergic medications, benzodiazepines and antidepressants were very common in these patients considered stabilized (49.9%, 39.8% and 24.8% respectively), which is similar to that observed in their non-stabilized counterparts (47.6%, 45%, 8% and 26.4%, respectively). Patient follow-up remained above an average of 1 patient visit per month (an average of 8.9 visit over the last 6 months), despite the fact that patients were considered stabilized. Two primary criteria were used by psychiatrists to determine that a patient was stabilized: treatment compliance and the absence of positive symptoms. However, 43% of the patients which were considered stabilized still presented with positive symptoms. Negative symptoms were also very prevalent in these patients (65%), as well as concomitant depressive signs (36%) and anxiety (64%).", 
    "35": "Even though the concept of stabilization remains difficult to define, it appears that schizophrenic patients are considered by their psychiatrist as stabilized on the grounds of good treatment compliance and decreased positive symptoms. Therefore, even in these so-called stabilized patients, enhancements are still possible, as symptoms remain present.", 
    "36": "The trend of illicit drug seizures and analysis in Singapore over a 10-year period from 1986 to 1995 was examined and reviewed. The main drugs were heroin, opium, cannabis, and illicit tablets containing benzodiazepines and amphetamines. The emergence of amphetamines in early 1996 was a major departure from the traditional drug abuse pattern in Singapore. Changes in the legal definitions of opium and cannabis were also reviewed.", 
    "37": "Benzodiazepine potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission is associated with the presence of a gamma-2 subunit in the GABAA receptor. A method was developed to modify the gamma-2 subunit expression in adult rat brain. Unilateral intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of a 17-base phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) was performed every 12 hr for 3 days. Controls were treated with a sense oligodeoxynucleotide. Parasagittal brain sections were used for quantitative autoradiographic analysis of radioligand binding. ASO treatment caused a 15% to 25% decrease of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding in most brain areas, with statistically significant decreases in frontal cortex, cerebellar molecular layer, zona reticulata of substantia nigra and CA3 of hippocampus. In contrast, [3H]muscimol binding was not changed. [3H]GABA binding was also unchanged, except for a 10% decrease in cerebellar granule cell layer. The effect on the chloride channel of the GABAA receptor complex was examined by 4'-ethynyl-4-n-[2, 3-3H2]propylbicycloorthobenzoate binding; most brain areas showed small decreases in 4'-ethynyl-4-n-[2, 3-3H2]propylbicycloorthobenzoate binding. However, hippocampal regions showed much larger decreases. Binding of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine was used to examine possible secondary effects of the ASO. There was a decrease in [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine binding, but this was much smaller than the change in [3H]flunitrazepam binding, and no area showed a significant effect. Quantitative immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes GABAA receptor beta-2 and beta-3 subunits showed no change in immunoreactivity in cerebellar tissue after ASO treatment. The results indicate a selective effect on benzodiazepine binding to GABAA receptors and a possible change in receptor subunit composition.", 
    "38": "We studied effects of a novel alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, YNS-15P (N-[(2R,11bS)-9-methoxy-1,3,4,6,7, 11b-hexahydro-2H-benzoquinolizin-2-yl]-N-methylmethanesulfonami de hydrochloride), on colonic propulsion stimulated by wrap-restraint stress (WRS) or bethanechol, on normal colonic propulsion and on diarrhea induced by castor oil in rats. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists, rauwolscine and RX821002, decreased the increase in the number and weight of fecal pellets induced by WRS. YNS-15P also inhibited WRS-stimulated fecal excretion in a dose-dependent manner. A 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist, granisetron, trimebutine and diazepam, but not a 5-hydroxytryptamine4 receptor antagonist, GR113808, significantly inhibited WRS-stimulated fecal excretion. YNS-15P inhibited WRS-stimulated colonic transit in a dose-dependent manner. However, YNS-15P had no significant effect on normal fecal excretion and colonic transit or on bethanechol-stimulated fecal excretion. YNS-15P also failed to inhibit castor-oil-induced diarrhea. These results indicate that YNS-15P selectively inhibits WRS-stimulated colonic propulsion, and that alpha-2 adrenoceptors may be involved in stress-induced colonic motor dysfunction in fed rats.", 
    "39": "FAST and SLOW selected mouse lines were bred for differences in locomotor response to low-dose ethanol. FAST mice exhibit an extreme stimulant response and SLOW mice exhibit locomotor depression at the same ethanol dose. We tested the hypothesis that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems modulate ethanol's stimulant effects by examining convulsant responses to GABAA receptor ligands, and by assessing the effects of GABAA and GABAB ligands on locomotor activity in the presence and absence of EtOH. FAST mice were more sensitive to the convulsant effects of GABAA drugs, and to one of two non-GABAergic drugs also tested. FAST and SLOW mice differed in locomotor responses to two benzodiazepines, but not to other GABAA receptor ligands. Ethanol's stimulant effects were not selectively altered by bicuculline or picrotoxin. The selected lines differed in sensitivity to the locomotor depressant effects of the GABAB agonist, baclofen. Ethanol-stimulated activity of FAST mice was inhibited by baclofen, and this effect was reversed by administration of the GABAB antagonist, CGP-35348. These GABAB receptor mediated effects were replicated in DBA/2J inbred mice that exhibit extreme sensitivity to ethanol's stimulant effects. In summary, we found moderate to strong evidence that some sites on the GABAA receptor complex were altered as a consequence of selection of FAST and SLOW mice, but found little support for GABAA mediation of EtOH-stimulated activity. In contrast, we found moderate evidence for differential alteration of GABAB receptor function; however, GABAB receptor involvement in ethanol-stimulated activity was strongly supported by results in the selected lines and an inbred strain.", 
    "40": "GABA-potentiating neuroactive steroids such as pregnanolone have potent protective effects in the pentylenetetrazol seizure test. We sought to determine if tolerance develops to the anticonvulsant activity of pregnanolone with chronic administration. Mice were treated with two daily injections of a 2 x ED50 dose of pregnanolone (25 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days. On the day after the chronic treatment protocol, the dose-response relationship for protection in the pentylenetetrazol seizure test was obtained. The ED50 value after the chronic treatment protocol was not significantly different from that in naive mice (12 mg/kg), indicating that tolerance does not develop to the anticonvulsant activity of pregnanolone. In subsequent experiments, we extended the chronic treatment protocol to 14 days with three daily injections of pregnanolone (25 mg/kg, i.p.). Again, no tolerance was observed (ED50, 13 mg/kg). The anticonvulsant activity of pregnanolone was well correlated with plasma levels in both the naive and chronically (14 day) treated mice. The estimated plasma concentrations of pregnanolone representing threshold (10%) protection (125-150 ng/ml) and 50% protection (575-700 ng/ml) were similar in naive and chronically treated animals. In both chronically treated and naive animals, plasma levels of pregnanolone declined rapidly (t1/2, 16-19 min) and there was a corresponding reduction in the anticonvulsant activity. Our results with pregnanolone suggest that tolerance does not develop to the anticonvulsant activity of neuroactive steroids as it does with other GABA potentiating drugs such as benzodiazepines, supporting the potential clinical utility of neuroactive steroids in chronic seizure therapy.", 
    "41": "The involvement of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex in rat pup ultrasonic vocalisations was studied by testing benzodiazepine receptor ligands with varying intrinsic activity and selectivity for benzodiazepine subtype receptors. Ultrasonic vocalisations were recorded under two temperature conditions (37 degrees C and 18 degrees C), presumably reflecting a low and high stress state. The latency to the negative geotaxis response, a measure of motor coordination and the rectal temperature were determined to assess putative side effects of drugs. The full, non-selective benzodiazepine receptor agonists diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, alprazolam and oxazepam suppressed ultrasonic vocalisations both at 37 degrees C and 18 degrees C conditions, although more efficaciously at 37 degrees C. The partial, non-selective benzodiazepine receptor agonist bretazenil and the partial benzodiazepine, selective receptor agonist alpidem significantly reduced ultrasonic vocalisations at 37 degrees C, but not at 18 degrees C. The full benzodiazepine, selective receptor agonist zolpidem behaved like other full, non-selective benzodiazepine receptor agonists by reducing ultrasonic vocalisations under both high and low temperature. The effects of zolpidem indicate that activation of benzodiazepine, receptors alone already suffices to suppress ultrasonic vocalisations. The non-selective, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil and the partial, non-selective benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG 7142 (N'-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) and the full, non-selective benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist DMCM (6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) had no significant effect on ultrasonic vocalisations under both temperature conditions. The involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in rat pup ultrasonic vocalisations (37 degrees C-condition) was confirmed by antagonism of the ultrasonic vocalisations reducing effects of chlordiazepoxide by flumazenil (1 or 3 mg/kg). Using the rat pup ultrasonic vocalisations paradigm under 18 degrees C and 37 degrees C conditions combined with measurements of negative geotaxis-latencies and rectal temperatures it is possible to (1) distinguish benzodiazepine receptor agonists from other anxiolytics because of dissimilar dose response curves at 37 degrees C and 18 degrees C, (2) differentiate partial from full receptor agonists by absence of effects at the 18 degrees C condition, (3) suggest a key role for benzodiazepine, receptors in the modulation of ultrasonic vocalisations. These data contribute to the predictive validity of pup vocalizations as an animal model of anxiety.", 
    "42": "A total of 97 patients were recruited into a prospective, follow-up study after they were prescribed an adjunctive antiepileptic drug. The patients were followed up over a 6-month period. The interview included questions on Quality of Life, side-effects, adverse events and seizure frequency and severity. We operationally defined patients 'satisfaction' as (i) still on new drug; (ii) experiencing no side-effects (iii) experiencing no adverse events and (iv) had a greater than 50% reduction in seizures. A total of 13 patients (17%) reported being 'satisfied' according to our operational definition.", 
    "43": "Six 1-month-old lambs were anaesthetized for cervical spinal cord surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) then halothane delivered by mask in an O2-N2O mixture. After endotracheal intubation, the lungs were ventilated mechanically and anaesthesia maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide. Buprenorphine and flunixin were given before and after surgery, and the wound margin was infiltrated with 0.5% bupivacaine solution. Neuromuscular block was produced with repeated injections of atracurium; neuromuscular transmission was restored with edrophonium. Lambs made a rapid recovery without obvious signs of discomfort, sedation, or weakness after operations lasting up to 156 min. Anaesthesia was induced in a seventh lamb using etomidate, which probably contributed to death during recovery from anaesthesia.", 
    "44": "A phase 2, single-blinded, randomized, multicentre trial was conducted to compare recovery times from anaesthesia between patients induced with a new short-acting benzodiazepine Ro 48-6791 (Hoffman-La Roche, Sydney, N.S.W.) or propofol. Seventy-six patients were randomly allocated to receive either Ro 48-6791 or propofol for induction followed by a standardized anaesthetic. Alertness and ambulatory function during recovery were scored by a rater blinded to treatment group. Mean time to awakening was longer for the Ro 48-6791 group (15 min), compared with propofol (7 min, P < 0.001), as was mean time to full clinical recovery (116 min vs 75 min respectively, P = 0.002). Both groups showed similar cardiovascular stability following induction, but shorter apnoea times were demonstrated for Ro 48-6791 (48s vs 133, P < 0.001). The longer recovery times with Ro 48-6791 would make this drug a less suitable sole induction agent than propofol for routine use in day stay surgery. Further studies of Ro 48-6791 should pay particular attention to the effect of dose reduction on recovery profile.", 
    "45": "1. At the molecular level much progress has been made towards elucidating the mechanisms of action of general and dissociative anaesthetics. However, little is known about how these molecular actions may lead to disruption of cognitive function. 2. A promising physiological correlate of cognitive function is the ability of spatially separate areas of the brain to synchronize firing patterns via mutual inhibitory, gamma-frequency (20-80 Hz) electrical oscillations. Here we examine the effects of five different anaesthetic/hypnotic agents with different primary mechanisms of action on these oscillations in the hippocampus. 3. Gamma oscillations were elicited simultaneously at two sites at either end of area CAI by tetanic stimulation. Such oscillations are synchronous between these areas even when separated by up to c. 4 mm in control conditions. 4. Agents which act directly on GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition had different effects on synchronous gamma oscillations. Thiopental (10-200 microm) markedly disrupted the oscillation and resulting synchrony whereas the benzodiazepines diazepam and temazepam (0.05-1.0 microM) had little effect. 5. The opiate morphine (10-200 microM) and dissociative agent ketamine (10-100 microM) had a different profile of effects on gamma oscillations. However, as with thiopental, both agents markedly disrupted between site synchrony. These three agents demonstrated this effect at aqueous concentrations relevant to anaesthetic ED50. 6. Using the hippocampus as a model neuronal network we propose that, despite differing primary mechanisms of action, anaesthetics may disrupt cognitive function by interfering with the mechanism of generation of synchronous firing patterns between spatially separate areas of the brain.", 
    "46": "We investigated the effect of dexamethasone (80 mg/kg per day for 2 days) and prednisolone (600 mg/kg per day for 2 days, equivalent to dexamethasone for glucocorticoid (GC) potency) on both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam (MDZ), a substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, in 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals received a single injection of MDZ (pharmacokinetic study, 10 mg/kg; pharmacodynamic study, 55.5 mg/kg) in the tail vein 24 h after the last dose of GC or placebo. The elimination half-life (t(1/2)) and the area under the concentration-time curve of MDZ were significantly reduced by pretreatment with dexamethasone to 58.9% and 44.7% of the control value, respectively, and the clearance of MDZ was significantly increased by dexamethasone. Similar changes observed by prednisolone pretreatment did not reach significance. The t(1/2) of the dexamethasone pretreatment group (14.4+/-0.7 min) was significantly shorter than that of the prednisolone group (20.9+/-1.5 min). The amount of CYP3A2 protein and the activity of erythromycin N-demethylase were significantly increased by dexamethasone and prednisolone pretreatments, but dexamethasone showed a greater effect than prednisolone. Sleeping time was significantly shortened by dexamethasone and prednisolone pretreatment to 38.7% and 57.1% of control value, respectively. The current study demonstrates that the anesthetic effect of MDZ would be reduced in patients treated with dexamethasone or prednisolone, and that the CYP3A induction was greater by dexamethasone than by prednisolone, implying that the potency of CYP3A induction may differ among GCs even when GC activity is the same.", 
    "47": "A 2-year-old male developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity, tremor of limbs, muscle weakness, ataxia, and hypertonia after he swallowed 16 50-mg tablets of lamotrigine. His vital signs were normal, as were electroencephalography and laboratory investigation tests. The urine toxicologic screen revealed no other drugs. Treatment included midazolam and gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal and fluid loads. Symptoms resolved within 24 hours, and the child was discharged without any further complications. Serial blood samples revealed plasma lamotrigine levels at the high adult therapeutic range (3.8 mg/L) but a slow elimination rate. This is the first report of seizure activity reported in a patient receiving an overdose of lamotrigine. However, no evident concentration-effect-side-effect relationship has been established in children. Interestingly in this child, lamotrigine overdose presented exclusively with treatment-emergent neurologic abnormalities, sparing all other systems.", 
    "48": "Significant progress has been made in the pharmacotherapy of alcoholism, specifically in the areas of withdrawal reaction, decreasing consumption, relapse prevention, and comorbid psychiatric illnesses. Psychosocial interventions are an important component of treatment strategies, and studies into the efficacy of medications often include psychotherapy or other nonpharmacological modalities. Increasingly, however, the evidence reveals the effectiveness of drug treatments for various components of the illness. Many different pharmacological agents and dosage regimens have been investigated for the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The effectiveness and simplicity of giving long-acting benzodiazepines, using a loading-dose technique, make this regimen first-line therapy. Both naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) and acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate) increase rates of abstinence and decrease relapse rates in alcohol-dependent individuals who are in abstinence-orientated programmes. If patients enter a comprehensive treatment programme, either naltrexone or acamprosate should be considered as an option in the treatment plan. The choice of medication is most likely to be determined by the availability of each, which differs considerably throughout the world. Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) seem to have short term effects, and are more effective in depressed alcoholics-dependent and in men. For all medications there is wide variability in treatment response (i.e. effect size) and compliance seems to be essential for successful treatment. Preliminary evidence suggests the usefulness of pharmacotherapy in treating alcohol dependence in the presence of other comorbid psychiatric illnesses. Antidepressants have shown efficacy in the treatment of alcoholism with comorbid depression, as has buspirone for the treatment of comorbid chronic anxiety symptoms. Further understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of dependence in animals and humans as well as improved knowledge of predictors of treatment response will lead to improvements in the pharmacotherapy of alcohol dependence.", 
    "49": "Since February 1996, high-dose buprenorphine has been approved for use in the treatment of opioid dependence. In addition, recommendations concerning indications, patient selection, prescribing information and patient delivery have been addressed to doctors and pharmacists. Between its date of approval for use and late 1996, the medical service of French National Health Insurance followed 149 illicit drug users who received high-dose buprenorphine. They all lived in the Vosges 'd\u00e9partement' and were affiliated with French Social Security Health Insurance. In general, the recommendations (consultation with a specialist, psychosocial follow-up and dosage schedules) were not followed by prescribing physicians. Concomitant prescriptions with psychotropic drugs, mainly benzodiazepines, were frequently encountered. This raises considerable concern since there have been recent reports of lethal intoxications with high-dose buprenorphine.", 
    "50": "Opioid analgesics are widely acknowledged as the most important drugs for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. Although these drugs can in most cases control severe pain, even when they are used appropriately, they may produce new symptoms or exacerbate preexisting symptoms, most notably nausea and somnolence. The combination of severe pain, anorexia, chronic nausea, asthenia, and somnolence is a frequent finding in patient with advanced cancer. An adjuvant drug should meet at least one of the following criteria: 1) to increase the analgesic effect of opioids; 2) to decrease their toxicity; 3) to improve others symptoms associated with terminal cancer. Many drugs, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants, corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, antiemetics, oral local anesthetics and bisphosphonates have been suggested to have adjuvant analgesic effects. Unfortunately, most of the evidence for the effects of these drugs is anedoctal. Controlled clinical trials are badly needed to precise the indications and the risk/benefit ratios of these agents, some of which have significant toxicity and could potentially aggravate narcotics toxicity.",

    "53": "The octadecaneuropeptide ODN (QATVGDVNTDRPGLLDLK), originally characterized as an endogenous ligand for central-type benzodiazepine receptors, increases intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in rat astroglial cells. A series of ODN analogues was synthesized, and each compound was studied for its ability to induce Ca2+ mobilization in cultured rat astrocytes. Replacement of each amino acid by an L-alanine residue (AlaScan) showed that the N-terminal region of the molecule was relatively tolerant to alanine substitution (2-8, 10), except for the Ala9-substituted analogue (9) which was totally devoid of activity. Pyroglutamization (21) and acetylation (22) of the Gln1 residue reduced the Ca2+ response suggesting that a free N-terminal amine function is required for full activity of ODN. Alanine substitution of the residues in the C-terminal region of the molecule (11-14, 16-18) significantly reduced the biological activity of ODN. In particular, modifications of the Leu15 residue (15, 20) abolished the Ca2+-mobilizing activity. The analogues [Ala9]ODN (9), [Ala15]ODN (15), [D-Thr9]ODN (19), and [D-Leu15]ODN (20) partially antagonized the Ca2+ response evoked by ODN. Most importantly, the octapeptide ODN11-18 (OP, 24) produced a dose-response curve that was superimposable to that obtained with ODN, indicating that the C-terminal region of the molecule possesses full biological activity. Finally, the AlaScan of OP revealed that replacement of the Leu5 residue by Ala (29) or D-Leu (33) totally suppressed the calcium response, confirming the crucial contribution of the Leu15 residue of ODN to the biological activity of the neuropeptide.", 
    "54": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor is a hetero-oligomer consisting of five subunits, the combination of which confers unique pharmacological properties to the receptor. To understand the physiological role of native GABAA receptors, it is critical to determine their subunit compositions. The pharmacological characteristics of human alpha5 beta3 gamma2 and alpha5beta3gamma3 GABAA receptors stably expressed in L(tk-) cells were characterized with the alpha5-selective ligand [3H]L-655,708 and compared with the pharmacological characteristics of [3H]L-655,708 binding sites from rat and human hippocampus. Saturation analyses revealed a 9-fold selective affinity of [3H]L-655,708 for alpha5 beta3 gamma2 receptors (Kd = 1.7 +/- 0.4 nM), compared with alpha5 beta3 gamma3 receptors (Kd = 15 +/- 3 nM). Rat and human hippocampal [3H]L-655,708 binding sites had affinities of 2.2 +/- 0.6 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 nM, respectively, comparable to the affinity of alpha5 beta3 gamma2 receptors. Pharmacological analysis of [3H]L-655,708 binding sites in rat and human hippocampi revealed a strong correlation with the affinities of seven benzodiazepine site ligands for alpha5 beta3 gamma2 but not alpha5 beta3 gamma3 receptors. Immunoprecipitation of [3H]L-655,708 binding sites from rat hippocampus with a gamma2-selective antibody yielded 19 +/- 4% of total benzodiazepine binding sites measured using [3H]Ro15-1788, whereas no specific binding was measured after immunoprecipitation with an anti-gamma3 antibody. Combinatorial immunoprecipitations of [3H]muscimol binding sites with anti-alpha5 and anti-gamma2 or anti-alpha5 and anti-gamma3 antibodies established the preferential expression of alpha5 gamma2 receptors, accounting for 22 +/- 2% of total rat hippocampal GABAA receptors. These observations provide pharmacological and structural evidence for the prevalence of alpha5 beta3 gamma2 GABAA receptors in rat hippocampus, despite the clustering of alpha5 and gamma3 loci on the same chromosome.", 
    "55": "We have reported previously that the transmembrane domains of the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCK-BR) comprise a putative ligand binding pocket. In the present study, we examined whether amino acid substitutions within the CCK-BR pocket altered the affinities and/or functional activities of L-365,260 (the prototypical nonpeptide CCK-BR antagonist) and two structural derivatives, YM022 (a higher affinity antagonist) and L-740,093S (a partial agonist). Eight amino acids that project into the CCK-BR pocket were individually replaced by alanine, using site-directed mutagenesis. Affinities for the nonpeptide molecules, as well as ligand-induced inositol phosphate production, were assessed with the wild-type and mutant receptors. For each of the nonpeptide ligands examined, a distinct series of mutations altered the affinity, suggesting that each ligand possessed a characteristic pattern of interactions within the CCK-BR pocket. Basal signaling levels and inositol phosphate formation induced by the full agonist CCK octapeptide were comparable for the wild-type receptor and all of the mutant CCK-BR forms. In contrast to the peptide agonist CCK octapeptide, the functional activities of the nonpeptide molecules were selectively altered by single point mutations within the CCK-BR pocket, resulting in interconversion of agonists and antagonists. These findings suggest that interactions between nonpeptide molecules and transmembrane domain amino acids of the CCK-BR can determine the functional activity and affinity of the ligands.", 
    "56": "Few pharmacotherapy trials have been undertaken in young people with anxiety disorders. Of those conducted, few are placebo-controlled or blinded, and often sample size is small, making interpretation of the data difficult. Case report and uncontrolled trial data generally support the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in many of the anxiety disorders seen in young people. However, most attempts to confirm these impressions in controlled trials have not been as encouraging. Further controlled studies in larger, diagnostically homogeneous samples are needed. At present, the decision as to whether or not to use medication in this patient population must be made on clinical grounds. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that anxiety disorders in young people can become chronic and cause at least moderate functional impairment in some individuals. This possibility has to be weighed against the potential for adverse effects of many of the drugs used clinically. Serious adverse effects appear only in a minority of patients; however, there does not seem to be a reliable method of predicting which patients might be at risk. Benzodiazepines are used to treat anxious children, notwithstanding concerns about dependence, behavioural disinhibition, cognitive impairment and mood changes. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are generally well tolerated, but their effects on cardiac conduction at higher plasma concentrations are well documented and there have been sporadic reports of sudden death associated with their use in children. Toxicity in overdose is an added concern. The use of selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors in children and adolescents is widespread, but few rigorous supportive trials have been conducted. The occurrence of both potentially serious adverse effects and other less serious, but troublesome, adverse effects and a possible discontinuation syndrome may complicate the use of these agents in younger patients. However, their relative safety in overdose and the apparent reversibility of adverse effects may favour their use over the TCAs. Other drugs used in this setting include buspirone and beta-blockers. No controlled trials are available at this time, but their adverse effect profiles appear to be relatively favourable and further study is warranted, given the promising nature of the uncontrolled data. The reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be useful in younger anxious patients, but controlled data are needed. The decision to use pharmacotherapy should be made after consideration of multiple factors, and firm recommendations for the use of drug therapy in anxiety disorders in children and adolescents await more rigorous data.", 
    "57": "Older people in the UK receive a disproportionate amount of medication. They comprise 18% of the population but receive 45% of all prescription items. Not surprisingly they experience drug-related illnesses - in 1980, 1 in 10 admissions to acute geriatric units were wholly or partly due to adverse drug reactions. Drugs which should be used with particular care or even avoided in older people include benzodiazepines, warfarin, digoxin, aminoglycosides, tricylic antidepressants, antipsychotics and long-acting oral hypoglycaemic agents. Pharmacists can promote safer prescribing practices by advising both patients and doctors. The community pharmacist can assist in drug compliance by providing patients with additional information about individual drugs, identifying potential adverse drug reactions and interactions, supplying appropriate drug containers or compliance aids, and even arranging home visits for patients unable to visit the pharmacist. Some community pharmacists provide pharmaceutical advice and services to residential and nursing homes. Pharmacists' advice to doctors can include one to one discussions in either primary or secondary care, assisting in medication review, providing information to prescribing committees, compiling drug formularies, assisting in auditing of prescribing practices and organising disposal of unwanted medicines and poisons campaigns.", 
    "58": "Therapeutic modulation of the increased GABAergic tone in chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) by the benzodiazepine receptor (BR) antagonist flumazenil (F) has led to conflicting results in humans and animal models for HE. The BR inverse agonist sarmazenil (S) has only been used in animal models of acute HE. Therefore we investigated the effects of intravenous injection of F and S in dogs with chronic HE 8 to 12 weeks after placement of a portocaval shunt and 40% hepatectomy (n=7), compared to sham-operated pair-fed controls (n=7). The HE dogs had hyperammonemia (298 +/- 48 microM v 33 +/- 3 before surgery (mean +/- SEM)) and signs of HE at the start of the experiments (0.9 +/- 0.1 (scale 0-4)). Three (S3) and 8 (S8) mg/kg of S resulted in a significant improvement of encephalopathy (grade 0.9 +/- 0.2 immediately before v 0.5 +/- 0.1 after injection (S3) and 0.7 +/- 0.1 v 0.3 +/- 0.1 (S8)) and increase in mean dominant frequency of the EEG (MDF; 9.1 +/- 0.7 Hz v 11.1 +/- 0.3 (S3) and 8.9 +/- 0.5 v 11.0 +/- 0.3 (S8)) in HE dogs, whereas 15 mg/kg of S, 3 and 8 mg/kg of F, and the vehicle had no significant effects. The efficacy of S in these dogs is consistent with an increased GABAergic tone in the pathogenesis of chronic HE. The lack of effects of F makes a role for endogenous benzodiazepines herein unlikely.", 
    "59": "Increased plasma and CSF concentrations of substances which bind to brain benzodiazepine receptors have previously been reported in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, their relationship to previous intake of pharmaceutical benzodiazepines has not been clearly established. In the present study, plasma levels of benzodiazepine receptor ligands (BZRLs) were measured using a sensitive radioreceptor assay in 12 control subjects with no evidence of hepatic, neurological or psychiatric illness, 11 cirrhotic patients without HE, 24 cirrhotic patients with moderate (grade I-II) HE and in 45 cirrhotic patients with severe (grade II-IV) HE. In addition, CSF concentrations of BZRLs were measured in 8 cirrhotic patients with HE and an equal number of age-matched controls. Recent intake (within 10 days) of pharmaceutical benzodiazepines was assessed by detailed review of medical files, and interviews with the patient, at least one family member as well as the pharmacist. Significantly increased plasma concentrations of BZRLs were observed in cirrhotic patients with severe encephalopathy (p < 0.02) compared to controls and to cirrhotic patients without (or with mild) neurological impairment. Increased plasma BZRLs could be accounted for by prior exposure to benzodiazepine medication in all cases. CSF concentrations of BZRLs in cirrhotic patients were not significantly different from control values. These findings do not support a role for \"endogenous\" benzodiazepines in the pathogenesis of HE in chronic liver disease but suggest that pharmaceutic benzodiazepines administered to cirrhotic patients as sedatives or as part of endoscopic work-up could have contributed to the neurological impairment in some patients.",

As far as the duration of ADs is concerned, clobazam in doses of 1 or 5 mg/kg i.p. blocked the progressive increase with repeated stimulations in all age groups and the higher dose significantly shortened ADs in 25-day-old rats. The intensity of movements accompanying stimulation was decreased only by the 5 mg/kg dose in 25-day-old animals, whereas clonic seizures were less intense after both doses in 12- and 25-day-old rat pups.

Under double-blind conditions, the acute effects of placebo and alprazolam (0.25, 0.50, 0.75 mg) were tested during both luteal and follicular phases. Women with confirmed PMS experienced substantial changes in mood as a function of menstrual cycle phase. However, under controlled laboratory conditions, acute doses of alprazolam did not improve negative premenstrual mood, but rather increased negative mood in the follicular phase. Alprazolam impaired task performance, although this impairment was generally similar in both phases when baseline phase differences were taken into consideration. Consistent with the failure of alprazolam to improve mood premenstrually, subjective measures indicative of abuse liability were not increased following alprazolam. Taken together, these data suggest that acute administration of alprazolam doses are not clinically useful for the treatment of PMS.", 
    "73": "The anticonflict effect of the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, was investigated employing an operant conflict task in pigeons. Behavior (key pecking) was stimulated by food presentation. A fixed-interval program of alternated punished (electrical shocks) and unpunished responding was employed. The effects of drugs were evaluated at two levels punishment intensity; i.e., baseline responding during the punished interval was 5% (higher punishment) or 10% (lower punishment) of the unpunished responding rate. Ondansetron released responding suppressed by punishment only when pigeons were working at the lower levels of punishment. Under these conditions, ondansetron (100 microg/kg, i.v.), increased key pecking by 119% above control and vehicle values, and doubled the number of shocks received by the pigeons during the punished intervals. Similarly to ondansetron, the anticonflict effects of buspirone (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 and 1.5 mg/kg) were strongly dependent on the intensity of the punishing stimulus. When punished responding was suppressed to 5% of unpunished responding by applying shocks of higher intensity, diazepam and buspirone had negligible anticonflict action. However, at lower levels of punishment, diazepam and buspirone produced much greater anticonflict effects than ondansetron (p < 0.001). These results indicate that ondansetron exhibits a modest effect in releasing behaviors suppressed by punishment (anxiolytic-like action), which was highly dependent on the intensity of punishment applied. It is proposed that the anxiogenic response to punishment is less sensitive to 5-HT3 antagonists than the behavior induced by aversive, unpunished situations, where 5-HT3 antagonists have shown comparable efficacy to benzodiazepines.",

The effects of Ro 15-4513, beta-CCE and beta-CCM were examined in four rhesus monkeys breathing air or 5% CO2 in air. When monkeys breathed CO2, minute volume (VE) and frequency (f) increased, on average, to 158 and 140% of control (air), respectively. Ro 15-4513 did not modify ventilation in monkeys breathing either gas mixture; however, beta-CCE and beta-CCM increased VE and f in monkeys breathing air to between 123 and 141% of control and had no effect on ventilation of 5% CO2. Increased ventilation produced by the negative GABA(A) modulators appeared to be maximal, because ventilation was not further enhanced when the dose was increased three-fold. Each of the three negative GABA(A) modulators reversed the decreases in ventilation produced by diazepam, suggesting that these drugs are acting at benzodiazepine receptors; however, the increased ventilation produced by beta-CCE and beta-CCM might suggest that they have more negative efficacy than Ro 15-4513. These data extend previous findings by showing that some negative GABA(A) modulators (Ro 15-4513) do not alter ventilation and further indicate that changes in ventilation can be used to evaluate efficacy differences among GABA(A) modulators.", 
    "75": "The effects of ethanol on spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) were studied in a culture of embryonic rat cortical neurons. In these experiments, EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded concurrently as inward and outward currents, respectively. These spontaneous currents were dominated by a slow (<1 Hz) repetitive pattern of prolonged N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-EPSCs and co-occurring IPSCs when Mg2+ was left out of the perfusate. A 3- to 5-min bath perfusion of 100 mM ethanol reduced the average integrated EPSC by 65%, while simultaneously potentiating IPSCs by about 3-fold. EPSC frequency was also reduced by about one-third. NMDA-mediated EPSCs were inhibited more than non-NMDA currents. A perfusion of 30 mM ethanol was less effective and probably represents a threshold concentration for these effects. The ethanol inhibition of currents evoked by directly applied glutamate or NMDA to these cells was much less than that observed for spontaneous EPSCs. Currents evoked by exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) application were never potentiated by ethanol. When spontaneous NMDA-EPSCs were blocked with an NMDA antagonist, ethanol no longer potentiated the IPSCs. However, benzodiazepine treatment increased these IPSCs 2-fold. In other experiments, spontaneous IPSCs were blocked by a GABA(A) antagonist. Here, the EPSCs occurred as groups of repetitive bursts. Ethanol decreased the total number of EPSCs per burst but did not decrease their overall amplitude, as in the control recordings. Thus, the way in which ethanol affects concurrently recorded spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs appears different from the way in which it affects isolated GABA- and NMDA-evoked currents. In addition, the antagonist studies show that concurrently activated NMDA and GABA channels each tend to limit the responses of the other. Thus, the overall effect of ethanol on spontaneous activity may result, in part, by a modification of this synaptic interaction.", 
    "76": "Previous research has suggested that rats tested at 28 to 30 days of age show a marked subsensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol. In the present study, rats of different ages were tested for aerial righting following acute ethanol (3 g/kg) treatment. These results were compared with the effects of the atypical benzodiazepine zolpidem (3 and 5 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (10 and 15 mg/kg). Animals tested at 25, 28, or 35 days of age were significantly less impaired by ethanol than preweanling rats (age 20 days) or older rats (age 65 to 75 days), whereas animals tested at 25 or 28 days of age were less impaired by the higher dose of zolpidem. With pentobarbital, the most distinct age-related trend was greater impairment in 20-day-old rats. Because ethanol may be active at the same type I GABA(A) receptor site selectively labeled by [3H]zolpidem, levels of [3H]zolpidem binding were determined for rats of different ages. Although some brain regions showed progressive increases in binding of [3H]zolpidem across development, other regions demonstrated increased binding from day 12 or 17 to day 20, then a plateau of binding levels across days 20, 25, and 28, with further increases occurring by day 36 or day 60. This pattern was observed in the cingulate cortex, medial septal nucleus, globus pallidus, inferior colliculus, red nucleus, and cerebellum. Overall, the results indicate that the period of subsensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol is coincident with a change in the developmental pattern of GABA(A) receptor sites targeted by [3H]zolpidem.",

For each driver, the risks of having a road-traffic accident while exposed and not exposed to a drug were compared.", 
    "79": "19386 drivers were involved in a first road-traffic accident during the study period. 1731 were users of any study drug. On the day of the accident, 189 individuals were taking tricyclic antidepressants (within-patient exposure odds ratio for an accident 0.93 [95% CI 0.72-1.21]), 84 selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (0.85 [0.55-1.33]), 235 benzodiazepines (1.62 [1.24-2.12]), and 47 other psychoactive drugs (0.88 [0.62-1.25]). The risk associated with benzodiazepine use decreased with increasing driver's age and was greater when the breath test for alcohol was positive. A dose-response relation was evident with benzodiazepines. The increased risk with benzodiazepines was significant for long-half-life drugs, used as anxiolytics, and for short-half-life hypnotics (all zopiclone).",

    "81": "Biodegradable polyesters have increasing importance as materials used for the preparation of microspheres. The knowledge of their degradation process is important to prepare microparticulate delivery systems with suitable drug release rates. In this work an in vitro degradation study of empty and drug loaded microspheres is described. Three different polyesters were used: two poly-d, l-lactides of different molecular weight and a poly-d, l-lactide-co-glycolide (50:50). Diazepam has been chosen as the model drug. Solvent evaporation and spray-drying were used as preparation methods. To study the polymer degradation process, a new HPLC method is proposed for the direct and (in the case of the copolymer) simultaneous determination of the monomer(s): lactic acid (LA) and glycolic acid (GA). SEM and particle size analysis highlight the different characteristics of the particles, depending on their preparation method: spray-dried spheres result to be always smaller with respect to particles obtained by solvent evaporation. The results obtained indicate in particular that: the preparation methods play an important role in determining the degradation behaviour of microspheres, as unloaded spray-dried particles are characterized by a higher monomer release rate with respect to microspheres obtained by solvent evaporation; PLGA spheres degrade faster than PDLLA microparticles, according to the higher hydrophilicity of the copolymer; the two monomers are released at a different rate in the case of PLGA (faster for GA, slower for LA); the presence of diazepam increases the polymer degradation rate, with respect to empty particles.", 
    "82": "A sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassay for FK480, a novel cholecystokinin type-A (CCK-A) receptor antagonist, was developed to study the pharmacokinetics of the drug at low-dose administration using a specific monoclonal antibody. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method had been used for studying toxicokinetics, but its determination limit (2.5 ng ml-1) was too high for use in clinical studies. Subsequently we developed an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using rabbit anti-FK480 serum (polyclonal antibody). It had higher sensitivity (0.1 ng ml-1) when 0.5 ml of plasma was used but its specificity was low because of the cross-reactivity of the metabolites of FK480. Therefore we produced several monoclonal antibodies for FK480 by cell fusion, and selected the antibody which was least cross-reactive for the isolated metabolites of FK480. Finally we developed a sensitive and specific EIA using this monoclonal antibody. The lower limit of quantification of this method was 0.2 ng ml-1 when 0.2 ml of human plasma was used. The coefficient of variation over the calibration range (0.2-10 ng ml-1) was less than 15%. We used this method for clinical studies, and it showed a good correlation to the HPLC method when plasma concentration was 2.5 ng ml-1 or more.", 
    "83": "To study the mechanisms leading to diazepam (DZ)-induced chromosome loss, we evaluated the effect of the drug on the distribution of cytoplasmic and mitotic apparatus proteins using specific antibodies. The use of antibodies directed against dynein and kinetochores (CREST staining) suggested that chromosomes arranged in monopolar spindles were interacting with short fibers originating from the monopole. Interestingly, nearly 50% of DZ-induced monopolar mitoses showed a punctate staining of centrosomes when evaluated with an anti-gamma-tubulin antibody. The extent of phosphorylation of mitotic proteins was not affected by drug treatment, as shown by staining the cells with an antibody against mitotic phosphorylated proteins (MPM-2). After recovery of DZ, nearly 20% of anaphases were abnormal and mainly consisted of multipolar anaphases and lagging chromosomes; this was consistent with a high frequency of kinetochore-containing micronuclei as evaluated by CREST antibody staining in cells that had divided only once after drug removal, i.e. binucleate cells obtained by cytochalasin-B treatment. Our data confirmed that DZ is a powerful inducer of chromosome loss in cultured rodent cells. Moreover, our results indicate that DZ interfered with the correct assembly of centrosomes.", 
    "84": "A multiple-trial passive avoidance paradigm was used to examine and compare the ability for estrogen replacement to attenuate learning and memory deficits produced by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the benzodiazepine lorazepam. The multiple-trial paradigm was used in order to distinguish effects on acquisition from effects on retention. Estrogen replacement significantly attenuated a scopolamine-induced deficit on passive avoidance acquisition, but not retention. The ability for estrogen to attenuate the effect of scopolamine on acquisition was observed only when the analysis was limited to animals with serum levels of estradiol <200 pg/ml, suggesting that higher levels of estradiol were ineffective. This observation is consistent with at least one recent study showing dose-related effects of estrogen on ChAT-like immunoreactivity in the basal forebrain and supports the hypothesis that effects of estrogen on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons can help to reduce cognitive deficits associated with cholinergic impairment. Estrogen replacement was also observed to protect against a lorazepam-induced impairment on passive avoidance retention. This effect was observed specifically in animals that received estrogen prior to and during training and was not due to any effect of estrogen on serum levels of lorazepam following acute lorazepam administration. Collectively, these data demonstrate the ability for estrogen replacement to attenuate specific pharmacologically induced impairments in learning and retention and provide additional clues as to potential mechanisms by which estrogen replacement may help to reduce cognitive deficits associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease in postmenopausal women.", 
    "85": "The most crucial step in the management of an antiepileptic drug (AED) hypersensitivity reaction is the recognition of the clinical syndrome and cessation of the presumed offending agent. The severity of the developing reaction will shape the course of treatment because multiple organ systems may become affected. Management of conjunctival involvement and treatment of skin lesions dominate care, with patients whose skin lesions are extensive benefitting from treatment in a structured burn unit. Neutropenia and sepsis are common and potentially fatal complicating factors. The use of steroids remains controversial, as is the utility of immune modulation with other agents such as cyclophosphamide and i.v. immunoglobulin. Acute treatment of seizures should be addressed with i.v. benzodiazepines, given either intermittently or by continuous infusion. Choice of long-term maintenance AEDs should take into consideration the crossreactivity among AEDs that share an arene oxide metabolite.",

In the presence of ruthenium red a dramatic increase in [Ca2+]m occurred 5-10 min after rigor development (the indo-1 fluorescence signal was saturated); [Ca2+]c also increased but to a lesser extent. On reoxygenation, [Ca2+]m fell rapidly even though cells hypercontracted and [Ca2+]c remained elevated.",

    "90": "This study has examined the effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone, nifedipine and verapamil on duration of immobility in the forced swimming test in mice. The 5-HT1A agonist-8-OH-DPAT (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg) and dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist-nifedipine (10 mg/kg) produced decreases in immobility time. These effects were similar to those of the tricyclic antidepressant-imipramine (5 and 10 mg/kg). Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist-verapamil (10 and 20 mg/kg) had no effect on immobility time. The non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic and 5-HT1A agonist-buspirone (1 mg/kg) when given in a single injection or as repeated treatment, did not exert antidepressant-like activity in the forced swimming test. Pretreatment with dopamine antagonist-haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) significantly antagonized the effects of 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg), imipramine (10 mg/kg) and nifedipine (10 mg/kg). Pretreatment with benzodiazepine anxiolytic-diazepam (2 mg/kg) antagonized the effect of imipramine (10 mg/kg) but not that of 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) or nifedipine (10 mg/kg). Neither haloperidol nor diazepam produced any effects in this test. Single or repeated administration of buspirone (1 mg/kg) did not alter the reduction of immobility time produced by imipramine (10 mg/kg). These results suggest that 5-HT1A agonists and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may have antidepressant efficacy in the forced swimming test, but the effects of buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT may be mediated via different mechanisms. These results also indicate that the relationship between serotonin and dopamine neurons may play a role in the action of antidepressant drugs. In addition, the interactions involving both GABAergic and serotoninergic processes exist between benzodiazepine anxiolytics and some antidepressants.",

Although the precise mechanism of the novel antipsychotic-associated diabetes is unclear, we hypothesize that histaminic and possibly serotonergic antagonism induces weight gain, which in turn leads to changes in glucose homeostasis.

Peak visually guided saccade velocity was decreased by lorazepam and chlorpromazine in a dose-dependent manner, with corresponding changes seen in VARS. Lorazepam, unexpectedly, did not affect peak antisaccade velocity. The background level of antisaccade directional errors was 6.43%, which is relatively low compared to control groups in patient studies.",

    "103": "At synapses, a transmitter released from a pre-synaptic terminal binds to specific, ligand-gated receptors in the post-synaptic membrane to open up ion channels through the receptor molecules. The flow of ions through these channels generates electrical signals. Electrophysiological techniques have been used over the past 50 years to understand transmission of these signals at synapses. The most recent of these, the patch-clamp technique, allows very small picoamp currents through single-channel molecules to be recorded but gives little information about receptor structure or how drugs influence their function. Now, the subunits of most ligand-gated ion channels have been cloned and sequenced. Cryo-electronmicroscopy has revealed the structure of the ion channel activated by nicotinic agonists. It is pentameric and only a small part of it is in the membrane. In spite of this simple structure, the conductance of chloride channels activated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A) channels) is very variable and can be increased markedly by drugs such as diazepam. Site-directed mutagenesis and labelling of cysteine residues in the open and the closed states are being used to define the residues that line the ion channel. Similar methods are being used to find the way in which drugs such as general anaesthetics modulate the function of GABA(A) receptors.",

    "108": "High concentrations of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) have been detected in brain areas containing dopaminergic cell bodies and nerve terminals. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of a proteolytic fragment of DBI, the octadecaneuropeptide ODN, on apomorphine-induced yawning in Sprague-Dawley rats. Injection of graded doses of ODN (12.5 to 100 ng i.c.v.) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erections. At a dose of 100 ng, intracerebroventricularly administered ODN was able to inhibit, during more than 3 h, the apomorphine-evoked yawning. ODN also inhibited pilocarpine-induced yawning. Apomorphine induces a bell-shaped dose-dependent effect on yawning with a maximum response at the dose of 100 microg/kg and a much lower effect at a dose of 200 microg/kg. Injection (i.c.v.) of 100 ng ODN markedly attenuated the number of yawns induced by 100 microg/kg apomorphine but partially restored the yawning behavior in rats treated with a 200 microg/kg dose of apomorphine. At doses of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg s.c., diazepam did not modify the inhibitory effect of ODN on the apomorphine-induced yawning. Taken together, the present data suggest that ODN inhibits yawning downstream dopaminergic as well as cholinergic synapses involved in yawning. In addition, the effect of ODN cannot be ascribed to an inverse agonistic activity on central-type benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "109": "Two pharmacoeconomic studies on the treatment of acute seizures have been conducted. In 1991, Kriel and colleagues surveyed parents of children with a history of cluster seizures, prolonged seizures, or status epilepticus who had been instructed in the use of rectal diazepam. A comparison of data before instruction with data after instruction showed a reduced need for emergency department visits with rectal diazepam. Instruction thus provided a pharmacoeconomic benefit, despite the cost of the product. In 1996, Marchetti and coworkers found that intravenous fosphenytoin was associated with fewer adverse events than intravenous phenytoin. Fosphenytoin thus reduced the need for adverse event management and provided a substantial pharmacoeconomic benefit, despite its higher cost, compared with phenytoin. This study had a number of limitations, however, and hospital pharmacists remain resistant to the use of fosphenytoin. Additional studies may provide more pharmacoeconomic data to support the greater use of fosphenytoin in the treatment of acute pediatric seizures.", 
    "110": "The pharmacologic interventions for treatment of acute repetitive seizures and those for treatment of status epilepticus are similar. The choice of treatment should be based on the drug's onset of action, spectrum of anticonvulsant activity, route and ease of administration, elimination half-life, therapeutic margin of safety, and redistribution from the central nervous system. Treatment should be initiated early in patients who are prone to seizure clusters or prolonged partial seizures that may generalize or progress to status epilepticus. Benzodiazepines have become first-line drugs for treatment of acute seizures and status epilepticus, followed by phenytoin/fosphenytoin and phenobarbital. Short-acting benzodiazepines, including diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, and midazolam, can decrease the frequency of emergency department visits if given at the appropriate times. The recently approved intravenous formulation of valproate may be of use in children receiving oral valproate who develop breakthrough seizures caused by subtherapeutic plasma levels that are secondary to missed doses or an inability to tolerate oral valproate.", 
    "111": "Fosphenytoin, a prodrug of phenytoin, is rapidly and completely converted to phenytoin in adults after intravenous or intramuscular administration and is significantly better tolerated than parenteral phenytoin. Fosphenytoin is highly plasma-protein bound and, when present in sufficient concentration, will displace phenytoin from plasma proteins. The clinical utility is that fosphenytoin may be used to achieve therapeutic phenytoin concentrations more rapidly than intravenous phenytoin infused at its maximum recommended rate. In a clinical study of generalized convulsive status epilepticus, fosphenytoin, with or without benzodiazepine pretreatment, controlled seizures in 76 (93.8%) of 81 patients. In other studies, fosphenytoin maintained seizure control when substituted for oral phenytoin and for seizure prophylaxis in neurosurgery and trauma patients. Adverse events associated with fosphenytoin generally were related to the central nervous system and were similar to those associated with phenytoin, except for a higher incidence of transient pruritus with fosphenytoin. Intravenous fosphenytoin has significant advantages over intravenous phenytoin: It requires a shorter infusion time and fewer intravenous disruptions, causes less pain and burning at the infusion site and minimal consequences in case of intravenous infiltration, allows longer maintenance of intravenous sites, and has better intravenous fluid compatibility and stability. In contrast to intramuscular phenytoin, intramuscular fosphenytoin is well tolerated in both large loading doses and maintenance doses.", 
    "112": "Pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease has been studied by measuring cerebral blood flow and energy metabolism using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). These parameters are measures for brain tissue consisting of heterogeneous components such as neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels. It is still difficult to evaluate brain damages specifically involving either neurons or other components. Several trials were recently conducted to visualize neuron-specific injury in cerebrovascular disease by means of 11C flumazenil for PET and 123I-iomazenil for SPECT. These tracers selectively bind to central benzodiazepine receptor which is purely neuronal. A reduced accumulation of these ligands was found in the area surrounding the complete infarction and in the cortex remote from putaminal hemorrhage, indicating the existence of neuron specific injury not visualized by CT and MR. Neurological deficits were well correlated with the loss of cortical accumulation of these ligands. These preliminary studies indicated a potential of neurochemical imaging in cerebrovascular disease. Vulnerability to ischemia which may differ among brain tissue components, among subpopulations of neurons, and among pre-synaptic and post-synaptic functions can be more precisely examined. Neurochemical imaging can be also applied to reveal releases and re-organization of each neurotransmitter-acceptor system after stroke.",

Seventeen patients with unilateral partial epilepsy were subjected to 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT, and early and delayed IMZ SPECT. Then we quantitatively obtained the blood-to-brain transfer constants (K1) and binding potentials (BP) for nine regions of interest, and the regional CBF was also by using the simple angiographic method. From our data, significant asymmetries of BP in the inferior medial temporal lobe and cerebellum were shown and may be related to a remote effect such as crossed cerebellar diaschisis. In conclusion, the asymmetry of BP with iomazenil SPECT was demonstrated in patients with unilateral epilepsy that was not detectable by HMPAO SPECT.",

Because of the potential for central nervous system side effects, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-period crossover study evaluated the effects of 2.5 and 5 mg doses of zolmitriptan on psychomotor performance and investigated any pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction with diazepam. Twelve healthy volunteers received the following \"treatments\" as single doses: zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg + diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg + diazepam 10 mg and placebo. Pre-dose and at 1, 4, 8, and 24 h post-dose, the following validated battery of psychomotor tests was performed: Bond-Lader visual analogue scales (calmness, contentedness, and alertness factors), critical flicker fusion test, choice reaction time (recognition, motor, and total reaction times), finger-tapping test, number cancellation test and digit symbol substitution test. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan, its active metabolite, and diazepam and its active metabolites were measured at the same timepoints. Zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5 mg had no effect on psychomotor function when given alone. In contrast, diazepam 10 mg had profound effects, consistent with its sedative properties, but there was no synergism on concomitant administration of either dose of zolmitriptan. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan, diazepam, and their respective active metabolites were similar when the two drugs were given alone or in combination.",

After baseline haemodynamic measurements, the study drug was administered over 5-10 sec according to group assignment: Group A (pilot) cisatracurium, 0.20 mg.kg-1 (4 x ED95), (n = 7); Group B-cisatracurium, 0.30 mg.kg-1 (6 x ED95), (n x ED95), (n = 31); Group C-vecuronium, 0.30 mg.kg-1 (6 x ED95), (n = 31); Group D cisatracurium, 0.40 mg.kg-1 (8 x ED95), (n = 21); Group E-vecuronium, 0.30 mg.kg-1 (6 x ED95), (n = 10). The haemodynamic measurements were repeated at 2, 5, and 10 min after cisatracurium or vecuronium.", 
    "117": "Two patients in Group D had > 20% decreases in MAP, but only one required therapy for hypotension. The haemodynamic changes from pre- to post-injection in the cisatracurium patients were minimal and similar to patients receiving vecuronium.", 
    "118": "In patients with coronary artery disease, rapid cisatracurium (4-8 x ED95) boluses and vecuronium (6 x ED95) result in minor, clinically insignificant haemodynamic side effects.", 
    "119": "For the treatment of anxiety disorders and panic attacks in elderly patients a multidimensional approach including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and behavioral modification is crucial. More than in younger patients side effects of drugs have to be taken into account. For the long-term treatment only a few psychotropic drugs are recommended. Useful substances are antidepressants including tricyclics and the newer class of SSRI. Buspirone may also play a role in the long-term pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders. Neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and betablockers should only be prescribed after careful evaluation; by and large, they are of minor significance in the long-term strategy due to significant adverse effects. The pharmacological treatment should always be accompanied by psychotherapy. In particular, behavioral therapy and behavioral modification strategies are of benefit.", 
    "120": "A substantial portion of schizophrenic patients demonstrate suboptimal response to conventional antipsychotics. These agents are primarily effective in the treatment of psychotic symptoms; their efficacy in other domains of psychopathology such as negative symptoms, chronic aggressive behavior, and cognitive deficits, is limited or non-existent. In this group of refractory patients, the novel atypical antipsychotic clozapine has demonstrated robust efficacy, with response rates approaching 60% after twelve weeks of treatment. Efficacy of clozapine extends to symptom domains other than psychosis, including negative symptoms, mood stabilization, aggressive behavior and compulsive water drinking. Several novel agents, each of which shares some, but not all, of the preclinical and clinical characteristics that make clozapine so unique, have been introduced in the last 4 years. These agents demonstrate a broader spectrum of efficacy and an improved side effect profile in non-refractory patients. Initial data on their efficacy in refractory patients suggests that olanzapine does not achieve overall superior efficacy in this patient population compared to conventional agents although there is some evidence of relatively greater efficacy in negative symptoms and aggressivity. Several studies suggest that the efficacy of risperidone is superior to that of conventional agents in refractory patients. Preliminary conclusions are not possible for quetiapine because of a paucity of data in the literature. The literature supports a risperidone trial prior to a clozapine trial in a treatment algorithm for refractory patients because of its more favorable risk/benefit profile.", 
    "121": "Benzodiazepines are sedative hypnotic medications that can induce a state of dependence. Dependence however is not the same as addiction. The development of dependence is a predictable phenomenon, influenced by dose, duration of treatment, and a number of other factors including individual characteristics of the benzodiazepine user. It is unclear whether there are meaningful differences among benzodiazepines in producing a state of dependence. Benzodiazepine dependence is also characterized by a predictable discontinuation syndrome. Benzodiazepines are rarely abused by non-substance abusers. The regulation of benzodiazepines although the legitimate therapeutic use has been significantly reduced.", 
    "122": "Both physical activity and emotion produce physiological activation. The emotional component of heart rate (HR) can be estimated as the additional HR (aHR) above that predicted by O2 consumption. Our innovation was to substitute minute ventilation (V) for O2 consumption, calculating aHR from individual relations between V and HR during an exercise test. We physiologically monitored 28 flight phobics and 15 non-anxious controls while walking (leaving the hospital, entering a plane), and during a commercial flight. Raw HR did not differ between phobics and controls when leaving the hospital (118/114 bpm) or entering the plane (117/110 bpm). However, although aHR was not different when leaving the hospital (7.0/8.6 bpm), it was significantly greater when entering the plane (17.5/9.9 bpm), accurately reflecting the increased subjective anxiety of the phobics. V was not higher in phobics than controls during any condition, suggesting an absence of hyperventilation in the phobics. The results demonstrate the utility of our method for analyzing HR in people whose stress occurs when they are physically active.", 
    "123": "1. The present studies evaluated the participation of central muscarinic receptors in the cardiovascular effects of centrally injected neostigmine, a quaternary anticholinesterase, in conscious, sham-operated rats and in sinoaortic denervated animals. 2. The dose-dependent pressor effect of neostigmine (0.1 to 1 microg i.c.v.) was greater in sinoaortic denervated rats than in sham-operated animals, but only a dose-dependent bradycardic effect was seen in sham-operated rats. 3. Doses of 3.3 nmol (i.c.v.) of both the M1 muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine, and the M3 muscarinic antagonist, 4-DAMP, prevented the pressor response to 1 microg of neostigmine in sham-operated rats and in sinoaortic denervated animals; however, the M2 muscarinic antagonist, AF-DX116, partially blocked this response in sham-operated rats while failing to do so in sinoaortic denervated rats. In sham rats, doses of 3.3 nmol (i.c.v.) of both pirenzepine and 4-DAMP prevented the bradycardic response to 1 microg (i.c.v.) of neostigmine, whereas AF-DX116 induced a partial blockade. 4. 4-DAMP, at the dose of 0.3 nmol (i.c.v.), but not pirenzepine at the same dose, prevented the pressor effect of neostigmine (0.1 to 1 microg i.c.v.) in both groups of rats. Both muscarinic antagonists at this dose prevented the bradycardia elicited by the anticholinesterase (0.1 to 1 microg i.c.v.), but 4-DAMP showed a greater antagonistic action on this cardiac effect than pirenzepine. In sham-operated rats, i.c.v. injection of 0.3 nmol of AF-DX116 failed to modify the cardiovascular responses to 0.3 microg of neostigmine. 5. Results suggest mainly an involvement of brain M3-subtype muscarinic receptors in the cardiovascular effect of intracerebroventricular administration of anticholinesterase neostigmine in both groups of rats.", 
    "124": "1. The effect of several central nervous system active drugs was studied in vitro on ATPase-ADPase activity and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity from the cerebral cortex of adult rats. 2. Lithium (1.0-10.0 mM) had no effect on either ATPase-ADPase or acetylcholinesterase activity. 3. Imipramine (0.5-5.0 mM), desipramine (0.5-5.0 mM), amitriptyline (0.1-1.0 mM) and diazepam (0.5-2.0 mM) inhibited ATP and ADP hydrolysis at all concentrations tested. 4. AChE activity was altered by imipramine (1.0-2.0 mM) and by diazepam (0.5-2.0 mM). 5. The possible participation of ATP diphosphohydrolase and AChE in the action of these drugs cannot be ruled out. The probable reduction of ATP, ADP and acetylcholine hydrolysis by the inhibitory effect of these drugs is discussed.", 
    "125": "1. The peptide hormone and neurotransmitter, cholecystokinin, is widely distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system and mediates a diverse number of biological functions. 2. Two receptor subtypes, CCK-A and CCK-B, have been identified by both pharmacological characterization and molecular cloning. The CCK-A receptor is the predominant peripheral CCK receptor subtype and the CCK-B receptor is the predominant central CCK receptor. In addition, there are discrete populations of CCK-A receptors in the brain and CCK-B receptors are present in gastric mucosa. 3. Subtype selective antagonists have been developed which discriminate between the two receptor subtypes. One of the major chemical classes has exploited a benzodiazepine template present in asperlicin which was initially discovered in a natural product screen for CCK receptor antagonists. 4. The structurally related benzodiazepines L-365,260, L-740,093, and YM022 are selective antagonists of the CCK-B receptor subtype. Their in vitro pharmacological profiles have been characterized using the human CCK-B receptor expressed in CHO cells. 5. L-365,260 behaves in a manner consistent with that of a competitive antagonist and both L-740,093 and YM022 behave as insurmountable CCK-B receptor antagonists in vitro.", 
    "126": "1. Imidazole 4-acetic acid (IMA) is a naturally occurring metabolite in brain, although it is unclear what biochemical pathways are involved in its biosynthesis and breakdown. Some evidence, however, suggests that IMA is an oxidation product of histamine. 2. The compound has pronounced neuropharmacological properties, many of which are consistent with an activation of GABA(A) receptors. Indeed, IMA is able to displace [3H]GABA from GABA(A) sites in a potent manner. 3. IMA displays definite partial agonist characteristics as an enhancer of benzodiazepine binding to the GABA(A) receptor complex in membrane preparations. In addition, it has an affinity for GABA(C) receptors, where it seems to act as an antagonist, and perhaps as a weak partial agonist. A third recognition site for IMA in brain is the I1-imidazoline receptor. 4. Parenteral administration to experimental animals leads to a sleep-like state which can often be accompanied by seizures. In addition, central application of IMA has been associated with a dose-related reduction in arterial pressure and sympathetic nervous discharge. 5. No specific receptor site or uptake system for IMA has yet been discovered, adding uncertainty to its role in central nervous system function. Yet the possibility cannot be overlooked that IMA plays a role in regulating blood pressure.", 
    "127": "In the second of this series of updates on recent advances in medication, RICHARD GRAY summarises trials into the novel antipsychotic olanzapine, which has been shown to compare well to haloperidol, and is now widely used for treating schizophrenia and related psychoses.", 
    "128": "We previously reported that carbachol (CCh) caused the enhancement of NO production coinciding with negative chronotropy in cultured rat ventricular myocytes. In this study, we examined which subtype of muscarinic cholinergic receptor mediated these effects of CCh by measuring the NOx production with an HPLC-Griess reaction system and monitoring the beating with a Fotonic Sensor. The enhancement of NO production and negative chronotropy by 10(-4) M CCh stimulation were significantly inhibited by 10(-6) M atropine, 10(-6) M methoctramine, 3 x 10(-4) M L-NMMA, and 10(-5) M methylene blue. On the other hand, 10(-6) M pirenzepine and 10(-6) M HHSiD had no influence on the negative chronotropy by 10(-4) M CCh stimulation. Both 10(-6) M pirenzepine and 10(-6) M HHSiD suppressed the enhancement of NO production by 10(-4) M CCh stimulation slightly though not statistically. In addition, the m2 cholinergic receptor gene was expressed in our cell preparations, as demonstrated by reverse-transcriptase/PCR analysis. We concluded that M2-cholinergic receptor-mediated negative chronotropy may be due in part to activation of the NO-signaling pathway in cultured rat ventricular myocytes.", 
    "129": "Patients with social phobia who responded well to 6 months of open-label treatment with clonazepam were assigned to receive either continuation treatment (CT) with clonazepam for another 5 months, or to undergo discontinuation treatment (DT) using a clonazepam taper at the rate of 0.25 mg every 2 weeks, with double-blind placebo substitution. Clinical efficacy was compared between the CT and DT groups using three different social phobia scales. Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms were also measured. Relapse rates were 0 and 21.1% in the CT and DT groups, respectively. Subjects in the CT group generally showed a more favorable clinical response at midpoint and/or endpoint, although even in the DT group clinical response remained good. With respect to withdrawal symptoms, the rates were low in both groups (12.5% for CT and 27.7% for DT) with no real evidence suggesting significant withdrawal difficulties. At the end of 11 months of treatment with clonazepam, however, a more rapid withdrawal rate was associated with greater distress. This study offers preliminary evidence to suggest that continuation therapy with clonazepam in the treatment of social phobia is safe and effective, producing a somewhat greater clinical benefit than a slow-taper discontinuation regime. However, even in the DT group, withdrawal symptoms were not found to be a major problem. The study can be taken as supportive of benefit for longterm clonazepam treatment in social phobia, as well as being compatible with a reasonably good outcome after short-term treatment and slow taper."
