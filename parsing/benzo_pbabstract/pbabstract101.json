    "0": "Hippocampal theta rhythms have been associated with a number of behavioural processes, including learning, memory and arousal. Recently it has been argued that the suppression of hippocampal theta is a valid indicator of anxiolytic drug action. Like all such models, however, it has relied almost exclusively on the experimental effects of well-known, clinically proven anxiolytic compounds for validation. The actual predictive validity of putative models of anxiolytic drug action, however, cannot be rigorously tested with this approach alone. The present study provides a stringent test of the predictive validity of the theta suppression model, using the drug phenytoin (50 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg), and a positive comparison compound, diazepam (2 mg/kg). Phenytoin has two important properties that are advantageous for assessing the validity of the theta suppression model: 1) it is a standard antiepileptic drug with no known anxiolytic effects, and 2) its primary mechanism of action is through suppression of the persistent sodium current, an effect that should also suppress hippocampal theta. Because of the latter property, we also directly compared the effects of phenytoin in the theta suppression model with its effects in the most widely tested behavioural model of anxiolytic drug action, the elevated plus-maze. While an anxiolytic-like effect of phenytoin in the theta suppression model might be expected simply due to its suppressive effects on sodium channel currents, anxiolytic effects in both tests would provide strong support for the predictive validity of the theta suppression model. Surprisingly, phenytoin produced clear anxiolytic-like effects in both neurophysiological and behavioural models, thus providing strong evidence of the predictive validity of the theta suppression model.

    "1": "Acute repetitive seizures (ARS) are a debilitating part of episodic seizure activity that can sometimes progress to status epilepticus. Currently approved treatment that can be administered by non-medical personnel to patients with ARS is a diazepam rectal gel. While effective, rectal administration can be difficult, inconvenient and objectionable. A diazepam autoinjector has been developed to deliver diazepam via an intramuscular (IM) injection. This study evaluated the dose proportionality of the diazepam autoinjector and the consequent diazepam bioavailability relative to an equivalent dose of diazepam administered rectally as a commercial gel.", 
    "2": "This was a phase I, randomized, open-label, two-part, single-dose, crossover, single-centre pharmacokinetic study in 48 healthy young adult (aged 18-40 years) male and female subjects. Part I of the study (n\u2009=\u200924) evaluated the dose proportionality of three strengths of the diazepam autoinjector (5, 10 and 15 mg) administered into the mid-outer thigh via a deep IM injection. Part II (n\u2009= 24) assessed the relative bioavailability of the diazepam 10\u2009mg autoinjector versus the diazepam 10\u2009mg rectal gel. Parts I and II were run concurrently. Each subject completed screening up to 30 days prior to three (Part I) or two (Part II) dosing periods. Serial blood sampling for plasma diazepam and desmethyldiazepam (metabolite) concentrations, vital signs and adverse event (AE) assessments were performed at prespecified times. Treatments were separated by a 14-day washout period.", 
    "3": "In Part I, dose proportionality was demonstrated for the diazepam autoinjector at 5, 10 and 15 mg doses by increases in mean maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC(\u221e)), and mean AUC from time zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUC(last)). The median time to reach C(max) (t(max)) was consistent at 1 hour for each dose. In Part II of the study, IM administration via diazepam autoinjector (10 mg) resulted in plasma concentrations of both diazepam and desmethyldiazepam that were slightly higher and less variable than those observed following administration of diazepam rectal gel (10 mg). The geometric mean ratio (diazepam autoinjector/diazepam rectal gel) and 90% confidence intervals for diazepam C(max) and AUC(last) were 0.94 (0.84, 1.05) and 1.14 (1.08, 1.21), respectively, indicating that the overall bioavailability of the diazepam autoinjector was approximately 14% higher than that of diazepam rectal gel. Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Although the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was higher with diazepam autoinjector compared with diazepam rectal gel (21.7% vs 13.6%), the difference can be attributed to injection site pain. Injection site pain also correlated with the diazepam autoinjector dose administered in Part I: 5 mg (4.3%), 10 mg (21.7%) and 15 mg (27.3%). However, no patients discontinued the trial due to injection site pain. No other AEs correlated with dose, and there was no evidence of respiratory depression with either administration.",

    "7": "HTDP-2 inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by 4-AP in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of glutamate release by HTDP-2 was prevented by the chelating intraterminal Ca\u00b2\u207a ions, and by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1, but was insensitive to the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate. HTDP-2 did not alter the resting synaptosomal membrane potential or 4-AP-mediated depolarization whereas it decreased the 4-AP-induced increase in [Ca\u00b2\u207a](c). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of HTDP-2 on the evoked glutamate release was abolished by the N-, and P/Q-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channel blocker \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIC, but not by the ryanodine receptor blocker dantrolene, or the mitochondrial Na\u207a/Ca\u00b2\u207a exchanger blocker CGP37157.", 
    "8": "Based on these results, we suggest that, in rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals, HTDP-2 decreases voltage-dependent Ca\u00b2\u207a channel activity and, in so doing, inhibits the evoked glutamate release.", 
    "9": "The present study was designed to explore the possible nitriergic influence and role of p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB in the diminished anti-anxiety effect of diazepam in stressed mice, using the elevated plus maze and light/dark box to assess anxiety. Immobilization stress for 6 h enhanced an anxiety-like behavior and increased plasma nitrite levels in mice. Diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) produced an anti-anxiety effect in unstressed mice, but could not produce any change in anxiety levels of stressed mice. SB-203580 (2 mg/kg, i.p.), a specific inhibitor of p38MAPK, per se produced a significant antianxiety-like activity in stressed mice. Administration of a combination of SB-203580 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) in stressed mice produced a significantly higher antianxiety-like activity than that produced by SB-203580 alone. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an inhibitor of the activation of NF-\u03baB, per se produced a significant antianxiety-like activity in stressed mice. Combination of PDTC and diazepam also served to produce a higher significant antianxiety-like activity in stressed mice than that produced by PDTC alone. Diazepam could not produce any change in plasma nitrite levels in both unstressed and stressed mice. Both SB-203580 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) and PDTC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased plasma nitrite levels in stressed mice. The observations indicate that the diminished anti-anxiety effect of diazepam in stressed mice may involve strong nitriergic influence and may further be p38MAPK- and NF-\u03baB-dependent.",

    "18": "Panic is commonly co-morbid with schizophrenia. Panic may emerge prodromally, contribute to specific psychotic symptoms, and predict medication response. Panic is often missed due to agitation, impaired cognition, psychotic symptom overlap and limited clinician awareness. Carbon dioxide exposure has been used reliably to induce panic in non-psychotic panic subjects, but has not been systematically studied in schizophrenia. Eight inpatients with schizophrenia, recent auditory hallucinations, none preselected for panic, all on antipsychotic medication, received a structured Panic and Schizophrenia Interview (PaSI), assessing DSM-IV panic symptoms concurrent with paroxysmal auditory hallucinations. On that interview, all eight subjects reported panic concurrent with auditory hallucinations. At one sitting, subjects were exposed, in random order, to 35% carbon dioxide and to placebo room air, blinded to condition. All subjects experienced panic to carbon dioxide, one with limited symptoms. Only one subject panicked to placebo. One subject (one of only two without antipanic medication) had paroxysmal voices concurrent with induced panic. With added adjunctive clonazepam, that patient had marked clinical improvement and no response to carbon dioxide re-challenge. This first systematic examination offers preliminary evidence that carbon dioxide safely induces panic symptoms in schizophrenia.

One-pot preparation of this benzodiazepine derivative was achieved using microwave irradiation giving 49% yield of the desired product. BDC inhibited FNZ binding to GABA(A)-R with an inhibition binding constant K(i) = 0.89 \u03bcM and expanded a model membrane packed up to 35 mN m(-1) when penetrating in it from the aqueous phase.

This study examined the ability of N-desmethylclozapine and N-desmethylolanzapine (metabolites of the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine, respectively) to induce cross-tolerance to the discriminative stimulus effects of clozapine. After C57BL/6 mice were trained to reliably discriminate 2.5 mg/kg clozapine from vehicle, a clozapine generalization curve was generated. Next, training was suspended and the mice received a maintenance dosing regimen in which they were injected twice daily with 10 mg/kg N-desmethylclozapine for 10 days. Then a second clozapine generalization curve was generated. This was followed by a 10-day washout period during which the mice did not receive drug injections or discrimination training. Finally, a third clozapine generalization curve was generated. These same procedures were followed for N-desmethylolanzapine (10 mg/kg twice daily during maintenance dosing). Both N-desmethylclozapine and N-desmethylolanzapine produced significant rightward shifts in the clozapine generalization curve indicating cross-tolerance between N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine and between N-desmethylolanzapine and clozapine. After a washout period with no training or drug administration this cross-tolerance effect was lost for both metabolites. This cross-tolerance drug discrimination procedure demonstrated in-vivo similarities between these two metabolites and clozapine and suggests that common underlying pharmacological mechanisms were responsible for the cross-tolerance that was observed. These findings also demonstrated that this procedure may be useful for identifying drugs with therapeutic efficacy similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine under repeated dosing conditions.", 
    "61": "Perfluorooctanoate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) agonist, has the potential to lower testosterone levels as a result of testicular toxicity. To elucidate the mechanism and impact of PPAR\u03b1 on this reproductive toxicity, ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) at doses of 0, 1.0 (low) mg/kg/day, or 5.0 (high) mg/kg/day was orally given daily to 129/sv wild-type (mPPAR\u03b1), Ppar\u03b1-null and PPAR\u03b1-humanized (hPPAR\u03b1) mice for 6 weeks. Both low- and high-dose APFO significantly reduced plasma testosterone concentrations in mPPAR\u03b1 and hPPAR\u03b1 mice, respectively. These decreases may, in part, be associated with decreased expression of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein or peripheral benzodiazepine receptor as well as microsomal cytochrome P450(17\u03b1) involved in the steroidogenesis. Additionally, both doses increased abnormalities in sperm morphology and vacuolated cells in the seminiferous tubules of both mouse lines. In contrast, APFO caused only a marginal effect either on the testosterone synthesis system or sperm and testis morphology in Ppar\u03b1-null mice. These results suggest that APFO may disrupt testosterone biosynthesis by lowering the delivery of cholesterol into the mitochondria and decreasing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and androstandione in the testis of mPPAR\u03b1 and hPPAR\u03b1 mice, which may, in part, be related to APFO-induced mitochondrial damage.",

Three different methods of coating preparation (dipping, brush painting, and spraying) were evaluated; the spraying method was optimum in terms of its stability and reusability. The high-throughput sample preparation was achieved by using a robotic autosampler that enabled simultaneous preparation of 96 samples in 96-well-plate format. The increased volume of the extraction phase of the C18-PAN thin film coating resulted in significant enhancement in the extraction recovery when compared with that of the C18-PAN rod fibers. Various factors, such as reusability, reproducibility, pH stability, and reliability of the coating were evaluated. The results showed that the C18-PAN 96-blade SPME coating presented good extraction recovery, long-term reusability, good reproducibility, and biocompatibility. The limits of detection and quantitation were in the ranges of 0.1-0.3 and 0.5-1 ng/mL for all four analytes.",

Every effort should be made to quickly and efficiently relocate the disrupted ankle joint. Within the emergency department setting, narcotics and benzodiazepines can be used to sedate the patient before attempting closed reduction. The combination of narcotics and benzodiazepines provides relief of pain and muscle guarding; however, it conveys a risk of seizure as well as respiratory arrest. An alternative to conscious sedation is the hematoma block, or an intra-articular local anesthetic injection in the ankle joint and the associated fracture hematoma. The hematoma block offers a comparable amount of analgesia to conscious sedation without the additional cardiovascular risk, hospital cost, and procedure time.",

From its inception until 1985 more than 170 scientists produced over 800 scientific publications that largely influenced the direction of neuroscience research. Under Dr. Costa's scientific guidance LPP made numerous discoveries that contributed to the understanding of neuronal function and push the fledging field of neuroscience forward. Methods were developed to measure the turnover rate of catecholamines, serotonin, acetylcholine and GABA, and to assess the dynamic state of neuronal stores of peptides; the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity was revealed; the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter receptor signaling and regulation were explored; the concept that opioid peptides function as neuromodulators in structures that are not involved in pain threshold regulation was proposed; the role of GABAergic transmission for the action of benzodiazepines was pioneered; the endogenous mechanisms operative in opiate tolerance were elucidated; and approaches to measure mRNA and evaluate its regulation were introduced. As a tribute to Dr. Costa, this article presents the initial journey and the many contributions to teaching and research that he made from 1963 to 1985, a period that I worked with him and call it \"the golden years\".",

An indole carboxylate-PBD hybrid with six-carbon spacer structure (IN6CPBD) has been previously demonstrated to induce melanoma cell apoptosis and reduce metastasis in mouse lungs. This study aimed at investigating the efficacy of the other hybrid compound with four-carbon spacer (IN4CPBD) and elucidating its anti-metastatic mechanism. Human melanoma A375 cells with IN4CPBD treatment underwent cytotoxicity and apoptosis-associated assays. Transwell migration assay, Western blotting, and ELISA were used for mechanistic study. IN4CPBD exhibited potent melanoma cytotoxicity through interrupting G1/S cell cycle progression, increasing DNA fragmentation and hypodipoidic DNA contents, and reducing mitochondrial membrane potential. Caspase activity elevation suggested that both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways were involved in IN4CPBD-induced melanoma apoptosis. IN4CPBD up-regulated p53 and p21, thereby concomitantly derailing the equilibrium between Bcl-2 and Bax levels. Transwell migration assay demonstrated that stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) stimulated A375 cell motility, while kinase inhibitors treatment confirmed that Rho/ROCK, Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways were involved in SDF-1\u03b1-enhanced melanoma migration. IN4CPBD not only abolished the SDF-1\u03b1-enhanced chemotactic motility but also suppressed constitutive MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Mechanistically, IN4CPBD down-regulated Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK total proteins and MYPT1 phosphorylation. In conclusion, beyond the fact that IN4CPBD induces melanoma cell apoptosis at cytotoxic dose, the interruption in the VEGF expression and the SDF-1\u03b1-related signaling at cytostatic dose may partially constitute the rationale for its in vivo anti-metastatic potency.", 
    "86": "Medications often interfere with allergy skin test interpretation. This study was performed to determine which medications interfere with allergy skin tests. We retrospectively reviewed skin-prick test results from patients who had discontinued H(1)-antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), benzodiazepines, atypical antidepressants, antipsychotics, hypnotics, sedatives, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and H(2)-antagonists between 0 and 7 days before allergy skin testing. Ninety-seven subjects had taken second-generation H(1)-antihistamines within 7 days of skin testing; all patients who had stopped 3 days before testing had positive histamine controls. Two hundred sixty-eight skin tests performed on patients taking a single medication of interest showed that patients had the following percentages of a positive histamine control: TCAs, 56.5%; SNRIs, 100%; H(2)-blockers, 100%; SSRIs, 97%; PPIs, 97%; benzodiazepines, 85.7%; and atypical antidepressants/sedatives, 92.6%. The 580 patients taking multiple medications of interest showed that the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals of a negative histamine test for patients taking TCAs were 6.33 (2.11-20.5), for H(1)-blockers were 4.95 (1.78-15.1), for benzodiazepines were 5.01 (1.72-15.80), for atypical antidepressants/sedatives were 3.11 (1.09-9.61), and for H(2)-blockers were 2.91 (0.97-9.37). The odds of a negative histamine test for SSRIs, SNRIs, or PPIs were not significantly increased. SSRIs, SNRIs, and PPIs are unlikely to interfere with skin testing. TCAs, H(1)-blockers, benzodiazepines, quetiapine, and mirtazapine should be discontinued temporarily if clinically able. H(2)-antagonists, bupropion, eszopiclone, trazodone, or zolpidem showed minimal interference with immediate hypersensitivity skin test histamine response.",

Inhibitory compounds targeting components of DNA damage response pathways have been identified and are being used in clinical trials, in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, to enhance cancer therapy. Inhibitors of checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2, have been shown to sensitize tumor cells to DNA damaging agents, and treatment of BRCA1/2-deficient tumor cells, as well as triple negative breast cancers, with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors has shown promise. But systematic studies to determine which tumor subtypes are likely to respond to these specific inhibitors have not been reported. The current study was designed to test sensitivity of specific breast cancer subtype-derived cells to two classes of these new inhibitory drugs, PARP and Chk1 inhibitors. Luminal, HER2 overexpressing, and triple negative breast cancer-derived cells were tested for sensitivity to killing by PARP inhibitors, ABT-888 and BSI-201, and Chk1 inhibitor, PF-00477736, alone or in combination with gemcitabine or carboplatin. Each of the triple negative breast cancer cell lines showed strong sensitivity to the Chk1 inhibitor, but only the BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cell lines showed sensitivity to the PARP inhibitors, suggesting that in vitro testing of cancer cell lines of specific subtypes, with panels of the different PARP and Chk1 inhibitors, will contribute to stratification of patients for clinical trials using these classes of inhibitors.", 
    "88": "Response rate can influence the behavioral effects of many drugs. Reinforcement magnitude may also influence drug effects. Further, reinforcement magnitude can influence rate-dependent effects. For example, in an earlier report, we showed that rate-dependent effects of two antidepressants depended on reinforcement magnitude. The ability of reinforcement magnitude to interact with rate-dependency has not been well characterized. It is not known whether our previous results are specific to antidepressants or generalize to other drug classes. Here, we further examine rate-magnitude interactions by studying effects of two stimulants (d-amphetamine [0.32-5.6 mg/kg] and cocaine [0.32-10 mg/kg]) and two sedatives (chlordiazepoxide [1.78-32 mg/kg] and pentobarbital [1.0-17.8 mg/kg]) in pigeons responding under a 3-component multiple fixed-interval (FI) 300-s schedule maintained by 2-, 4-, or 8-s of food access. We also examine the effects of d-amphetamine [0.32-3.2 mg/kg] and pentobarbital [1.8-10 mg/kg] in rats responding under a similar multiple FI300-s schedule maintained by 2- or 10- food pellet (45 mg) delivery. In pigeons, cocaine and, to a lesser extent, chlordiazepoxide exerted rate-dependent effects that were diminished by increasing durations of food access. The relationship was less apparent for pentobarbital, and not present for d-amphetamine. In rats, rate-dependent effects of pentobarbital and d-amphetamine were not modulated by reinforcement magnitude. In conclusion, some drugs appear to exert rate-dependent effect which are diminished when reinforcement magnitude is relatively high. Subsequent analysis of the rate-dependency data suggest the effects of reinforcement magnitude may be due to a diminution of drug-induced increases in low-rate behavior that occurs early in the fixed-interval.",

The sensitivity for the drugs in solvent matrix was at the same level with DESI-MS and DAPPI-MS (LODs 0.05-6 \u03bcg mL(-1)) but the decrease in sensitivity due to the urine matrix was higher with DESI (typically 20-160-fold) than with DAPPI (typically 2-15-fold) indicating better matrix tolerance of DAPPI over DESI. Also in MS/MS mode, DAPPI provided better sensitivity than DESI for the drugs in urine. The feasibility of DAPPI-MS/MS was then studied in screening the same drugs from five authentic, forensic post mortem urine samples. A reference measurement with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (including pretreatment) revealed 16 findings from the samples, whereas with DAPPI-MS/MS after sample pretreatment, 15 findings were made.

In these patients induction of general anaesthesia to allow artificial ventilation is an important therapeutic option. Previously, it has been demonstrated that cholinergic overstimulation impaired network depressing effects of etomidate and sevoflurane. In this study we tested the impact of cholinergic overstimulation on inhibitory effects of diazepam in organotypic slice cultures of cerebrocortical neurons. Effects of clinically relevant concentrations of diazepam on spontaneous action potential activity were assessed by extracellular action potential recordings under basal cholinergic tone as well as in the presence of acetylcholine (1 \u03bcM). Diazepam at anaesthetic concentrations (25-500 \u03bcM) impeded spontaneous network activity in a concentration dependent manner (EC\u2085\u2080 80.5\u00b18.0 \u03bcM). In the presence of 1 \u03bcM acetylcholine the potency of diazepam was not significantly altered (EC\u2085\u2080 83.6\u00b18.4 \u03bcM). The results demonstrate that the potency of diazepam to depress neocortical network-excitability is not significantly impaired by cholinergic overstimulation. Diazepam thereby differs from other anaesthetics like etomidate or sevoflurane whose potencies and efficacies were severely attenuated. Hence diazepam might be preferable for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia in patients suffering from nerve agent intoxication.",

    "126": "Hyperlipidemia (HL) was previously shown to lower liver uptake of the more potent (-) enantiomer of ketoconazole (KTZ) in rat. The current study examined the possible modifying influence of experimental HL on a KTZ pharmacokinetic interaction with midazolam (MDZ). Normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic rats were administered a single intravenous dose of MDZ (5 mg/kg) with or without a single oral dose of racemic KTZ (40 mg/kg). Serial blood samples were collected over 8 h following MDZ injections via jugular vein cannulas. Plasma was jointly assayed for MDZ and KTZ concentrations using a validated assay. MDZ mean clearance (CL) was unchanged by KTZ coadministration. HL caused a significantly 61% lower MDZ-unbound fraction and decreases in volume of distribution (VD) but by itself had no effect on MDZ CL. This suggested that MDZ could bind to lipoproteins. With KTZ coadministered to hyperlipidemic rats, there were significant decreases in MDZ CL and VD. HL caused a decrease in unbound plasma fraction of oral KTZ but no significant difference in its pharmacokinetics. HL caused a more pronounced KTZ-associated inhibition of MDZ CL. This may be related to the decrease of MDZ's unbound fraction and perhaps to attenuation of CYP3A by HL in the rat.",

Deaths occurring during treatment or within 3 days after last methadone prescription expired were considered as cases \"on treatment.\" Fatalities occurring 4 days or more after leaving treatment were cases \"off treatment.\" Sixty-four drug-related deaths were identified. The greatest risk of drug-related death was in the first 2 weeks of treatment (adjusted hazard ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval 1.03-6.56). Risk of drug-related death was lower after the first 30 days following treatment cessation, relative to the first 30 days off treatment. History of psychiatric admission was associated with increased risk of drug-related death in treatment. Increasing numbers of treatment episodes and urine testing were protective. History of psychiatric admission, increasing numbers of urine tests, and coprescriptions of benzodiazepines increased the risk of mortality out of treatment. The risk of drug-related mortality in MMT is elevated during periods of treatment transition, specifically treatment initiation and the first 30 days following treatment dropout or discharge.",

    "146": "The success of antipsychotic drug treatment in patients with schizophrenia is limited by the propensity of these drugs to induce hyperphagia, weight gain and other metabolic disturbances, particularly evident for olanzapine and clozapine. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in antipsychotic-induced hyperphagia remain unclear. Here, we investigate the effect of olanzapine administration on the regulation of hypothalamic mechanisms controlling food intake, namely neuropeptide expression and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in rats. Our results show that subchronic exposure to olanzapine upregulates neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti related protein (AgRP) and downregulates proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). This effect was evident both in rats fed ad libitum and in pair-fed rats. Of note, despite weight gain and increased expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, subchronic administration of olanzapine decreased AMPK phosphorylation levels. This reduction in AMPK was not observed after acute administration of either olanzapine or clozapine. Overall, our data suggest that olanzapine-induced hyperphagia is mediated through appropriate changes in hypothalamic neuropeptides, and that this effect does not require concomitant AMPK activation. Our data shed new light on the hypothalamic mechanism underlying antipsychotic-induced hyperphagia and weight gain, and provide the basis for alternative targets to control energy balance.",

    "148": "Vestibular migraine is considered to be the second most common cause of vertigo and the most common cause of spontaneous episodic vertigo. The duration of attacks varies from seconds to days, usually lasting minutes to hours, and they mostly occur independently of headaches. Long-lasting individual attacks are treated with generic antivertiginous and antiemetic drugs. Specific antimigraine drugs are unlikely to be very effective for rescue. The mainstay of the management of vestibular migraine is prophylactic medication. To date, there are no controlled trials available; the body of knowledge builds on case series and retrospective or observational studies. Most drugs are also used for the prevention of migraine headaches. The choice of medication should be guided by its side effect profile and the comorbidities of patients. Betablockers such as propanolol or metoprolol are preferred in patients with hypertension but in the absence of asthma. Anticonvulsants include topiramate when patients are obese, valproic acid and lamotrigine. Lamotrigine is preferred if vertigo is more frequent than headaches. Calcium antagonists include verapamil and flunarizine. If patients have anxiety, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitryptiline or nortryptiline or SSRIs and benzodiazepines such as clonazepam are recommended. Acetazolamide is effective in rare genetic disorders related to migraine-like episodic ataxia; however, its place in vestibular migraine is still to be established. Nonpharmacological measures such as diet, sleep, hygiene and avoidance of triggers are recommended as they are for migraine. Vestibular rehabilitation might be useful when there are complications such as loss of confidence in balance or visual dependence.", 
    "149": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) comprises a group of syndromes that display a great diversity regarding response to anticonvulsants ranging from virtually self-limiting variants to entirely refractory forms. Therefore, treatment on intensive care units (ICUs) is required only for a selection of cases. The aetiology and clinical form of NCSE are strong predictors for the overall prognosis. Absence status epilepticus is commonly seen in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and is rapidly terminated by low-dose of benzodiazepines. The management of complex partial status epilepticus is straightforward in patients with pre-existing epilepsy, but poses major problems if occurring in the context of acute brain lesions. Subtle status epilepticus represents the late stage of undertreated previous overt generalized convulsive status epilepticus and always requires aggressive ICU treatment. Within the intensive care setting, the diagnostic challenge may be seen in the difficulty in delineating nonepileptic conditions such as posthypoxic, metabolic or septic encephalopathies from NCSE. Although all important forms are considered, the focus of this review lies on clinical presentations and electroencephalogram features of comatose patients treated on ICUs and possible diagnostic pitfalls.",

Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the contribution of dose, age, sex, body weight, and smoking status to the plasma olanzapine concentration. There were 5856 samples from 3207 patients. The prescribed olanzapine dosage was 2.5 to 95 mg/d. No olanzapine was detected in 6% of samples. For olanzapine dosages of 2.5 to 20 mg/d, only 35% of results were within a suggested target range of 20 to 39 ng/mL. At doses above 20 mg/d, 30% to 59% of results were 60 ng/mL or greater depending on dose band. In patients aged 17 years or younger (92 samples), median plasma olanzapine was higher than that in adult patients at almost all olanzapine doses. Multiple linear regression analysis of results from 627 adults from whom complete data were available showed that dose, smoking status, sex, age, and body weight together explained 24% the variance in plasma olanzapine. Degree of adherence, timing of sample postdose, drug-drug interactions, and pharmacogenetic factors also may have contributed to the observed variance. However, it is clear that female nonsmokers had higher plasma olanzapine concentrations for a given dose than male smokers. Olanzapine TDM is useful in assessing adherence and may have a role in limiting olanzapine dosage to minimize the risk of long-term toxicity.", 
    "155": "Nicotine functions as a negative feature in a Pavlovian discriminated goal-tracking task. Whether withholding of responding to the conditional stimulus (CS) reflects nicotine functioning as a conditioned inhibitor is unknown. Accordingly, the present research sought to determine whether nicotine trained as a negative feature passed the retardation-of-acquisition and summation tests, thus characterizing it as a pharmacological (interoceptive) conditioned inhibitor. In the retardation test, rats received either nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) negative feature training in which the drug state signaled when a 15-sec light CS would not be paired with sucrose; light was paired with sucrose on intermixed saline sessions. Following acquisition of the discrimination, both groups received nicotine CS training in which sucrose was intermittently available on nicotine but not intermixed saline sessions. Acquisition of conditioned responding to the nicotine CS was slower in the nicotine negative feature group than in the chlordiazepoxide negative feature group. In the summation test, rats were assigned to either the nicotine negative feature group or a pseudoconditioning control. In this control, the light CS was paired with sucrose on half the nicotine and half the saline sessions. Both groups also received excitatory training in which a white noise CS was paired with sucrose. The summation test consisted of presenting the white noise in conjunction with nicotine. Conditioned responding evoked by the white noise was decreased in the negative feature but not the pseudoconditioning group. Combined, the results provide the first evidence that an interoceptive stimulus (nicotine) can become a conditioned inhibitor.", 
    "156": "An imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission has been proposed to contribute to altered brain function in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and accordingly treatment with GABA-A antagonists can efficiently restore cognitive functions of Ts65Dn mice, a genetic model for DS. However, GABA-A antagonists are also convulsant which preclude their use for therapeutic intervention in DS individuals. Here, we have evaluated safer strategies to release GABAergic inhibition using a GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist selective for the \u03b15-subtype (\u03b15IA). We demonstrate that \u03b15IA restores learning and memory functions of Ts65Dn mice in the novel-object recognition and in the Morris water maze tasks. Furthermore, we show that following behavioural stimulation, \u03b15IA enhances learning-evoked immediate early gene products in specific brain regions involved in cognition. Importantly, acute and chronic treatments with \u03b15IA do not induce any convulsant or anxiogenic effects that are associated with GABA-A antagonists or non-selective inverse agonists of the GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptors. Finally, chronic treatment with \u03b15IA did not induce histological alterations in the brain, liver and kidney of mice. Our results suggest that non-convulsant \u03b15-selective GABA-A inverse agonists could improve learning and memory deficits in DS individuals.",

Patients were then randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pregabalin 300-600 mg/day or placebo while undergoing a gradual benzodiazepine taper at a rate of 25% per week, followed by a 6-week benzodiazepine-free phase during which they continued double-blind study treatment. Outcome measures included ability to remain benzodiazepine-free (primary) as well as changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM)-A and Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC). At endpoint, a non-significant higher proportion of patients remained benzodiazepine-free receiving pregabalin compared with placebo (51.4% vs 37.0%). Treatment with pregabalin was associated with significantly greater endpoint reduction in the HAM-A total score versus placebo (-2.5 vs +1.3; p < 0.001), and lower endpoint mean PWC scores (6.5 vs 10.3; p = 0.012). Thirty patients (53%) in the pregabalin group and 19 patients (37%) in the placebo group completed the study, reducing the power to detect a significant difference on the primary outcome. The results on the anxiety and withdrawal severity measures suggest that switching to pregabalin may be a safe and effective method for discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine therapy.",

Male Balb-c mice were treated with olanzapine (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg/kg; i.p.), sertindole (0.63, 1.3 and 2.5mg/kg; s.c.) or clozapine (0.5 and 1mg/kg; i.p.), and cognitive deficits were induced by MK-801 (0.2mg/kg; i.p.) administration. Olanzapine treatment decreased the ratio index in the NOR test, whereas sertindole and clozapine had no effect in naive mice. MK-801-induced cognitive impairment was reversed by treatment with olanzapine, sertindole or clozapine. While olanzapine, sertindole and clozapine had no effect on the anxiety of naive mice as determined by the open field test, MK-801 significantly increased the total distance traveled, time spent in the center zone and the velocity of the animals. MK-801-induced effects on locomotion and anxiety in the open field test were reversed by olanzapine, sertindole or clozapine treatment.

    "175": "Pediatric narcotic withdrawal syndromes are reported to be increasingly frequent in pediatric intensive care units. A number of tools specifically designed for assessment of withdrawal in newborns and infants are in current use, including the widely used Finnegan Scoring System. A limited number of studies and case reports suggest that dexmedetomidine, an \u03b1(2)-receptor agonist with a mechanism of action similar to that of clonidine but with greater \u03b1(2)-receptor specificity, might have a role in the treatment of pediatric withdrawal (by blunting withdrawal symptoms without causing respiratory depression and by permitting shorter narcotic tapering schedules) and also in the prevention of pediatric narcotic withdrawal (by reducing narcotic requirements). Potential adverse effects associated with dexmedetomidine use in pediatric patients are generally associated with use of bolus doses and mainly involve central nervous system effects (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia), with no hemodynamic manifestations. When bolus doses are used, strategies described in published reports entail a loading dose of 0.5-1.0 \u03bcg/kg administered over 5-10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.1-1.4 \u03bcg/kg/hr for a period of 1-16 days.

The phenyl ring at N-5 was replaced with more hydrophilic substituents, like alkyl groups bearing basic functions. In some cases, the resolution of the racemic key intermediates 3-amino-benzodiazepines was also accomplished. Among the compounds synthesized and characterised so far in this class, the 5-morpholinoethyl derivative 54, was selected as potential follow up of GV150013 and submitted for further evaluation.",

Patient distress was rated by blinded review of videotapes, using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Score. Secondary outcomes included activity scores, sedation adequacy, sedation onset, satisfaction, and adverse events.", 
    "180": "For the 169 subjects (median age 3.1 years) evaluated for the primary outcome, we found significantly less distress in the buccal midazolam group compared with the oral route group (P=.04; difference -2; 95% confidence interval -4 to 0) and a corresponding nonsignificant trend for the intranasal route (P=.08; difference -1; 95% confidence interval -3 to 1). Secondary outcomes (177 subjects) favored the intranasal group, including a greater proportion of patients with an optimal activity score (74%), a greater proportion of parents wanting this sedation in the future, and faster sedation onset. Intranasal was the route least tolerated at administration. Adverse events were similar between groups.", 
    "181": "When comparing the administration of midazolam by 3 routes to facilitate pediatric laceration repair, we observed slightly less distress in the aerosolized buccal group. The intranasal route demonstrated a greater proportion of patients with optimal activity scores, greater proportions of parents wanting similar sedation in the future, and faster onset but was also the most poorly tolerated at administration. Aerosolized buccal or intranasal midazolam represents an effective and useful alternative to oral midazolam for sedation for laceration repair.",

    "186": "The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is important for many cellular functions in mammals and bacteria, such as steroid biosynthesis, cellular respiration, cell proliferation, apoptosis, immunomodulation, transport of porphyrins and anions. Arabidopsis thaliana contains a single TSPO/PBR-related gene with a 40 amino acid N-terminal extension compared to its homologs in bacteria or mammals suggesting it might be chloroplast or mitochondrial localized.", 
    "187": "To test if the TSPO N-terminal extension targets it to organelles, we fused three potential translational start sites in the TSPO cDNA to the N-terminus of GFP (AtTSPO:eGFP). The location of the AtTSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found to depend on the translational start position and the conditions under which plants were grown. Full-length AtTSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found in the endoplasmic reticulum and in vesicles of unknown identity when plants were grown in standard conditions. However, full length AtTSPO:eGFP localized to chloroplasts when grown in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, conditions of salt stress. In contrast, when AtTSPO:eGFP was truncated to the second or third start codon at amino acid position 21 or 42, the fusion protein co-localized with a mitochondrial marker in standard conditions. Using promoter GUS fusions, qRT-PCR, fluorescent protein tagging, and chloroplast fractionation approaches, we demonstrate that AtTSPO levels are regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels in response to abiotic stress conditions. Salt-responsive genes are increased in a tspo-1 knock-down mutant compared to wild type under conditions of salt stress, while they are decreased when AtTSPO is overexpressed. Mutations in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes and the application of chlorophyll or carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors also affect AtTSPO expression.", 
    "188": "Our data suggest that AtTSPO plays a role in the response of Arabidopsis to high salt stress. Salt stress leads to re-localization of the AtTSPO from the ER to chloroplasts through its N-terminal extension. In addition, our results show that AtTSPO is regulated at the transcriptional level in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic mutants. Thus, we propose that AtTSPO may play a role in transporting tetrapyrrole intermediates during salt stress and other conditions in which tetrapyrrole metabolism is compromised.", 
    "189": "This article reviews the possibility of the use of paracetamol (perfalgane) as an analgesic component of medical sedation. The actuality of the problem is the choice effective pharmacological means of protection from peri-operative pain. The theoretical advantages of paracetamol in the scheme of sedoanalgesia are exquisite. We describe a personal experience of efficacy assessment and safety of paracetamol as an analgesic component of the methodology of drug sedation for bronchoscopy in the early postoperative period. We compare analgesia by the means of paracetamol 1000 mg (IV) and tramadol 100 mg (IV). The sedative agent in both groups was midazolam. It turned out, that despite the high efficacy of tramadol as a component of sedoanalgesia, the quality of anialgesia when using perfalagane is almost 5 times higher, both due to the significant number of good results, and to reduced number of adverse events. Use of paracetamol (Perfalgane) instead of tramadol for medical sedation during fibrotracheoscopy in patients in the early postoperative period leads to better quality of analgesia, thus avoiding such undesirable phenomena as hypersedation, respiratory depression, dizziness, and nausea.",

According to the literature the group of phenothiazines is the category of drugs with rare appearances of skin reactions. Promazine, aliphatic phenothiazines antipsychotic, including less frequent side effects in the leaflet states increased skin sensitivity to sun, skin rash-associated with contact dermatitis, allergic reactions, cholestatic icterus. The only reported dermatological side effect of promazine is its metabolites deposition in the cornea. Analyzing the e-data basis we have not found references connecting the Exanthema medicamentosum as a side effect of promazine.

The most frequent combinations of antidepressants in the youngest age group were SSRIs and combination of SSRIs and benzodiazepines; in middle age group it was combination of SSRIs and benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines; and in the oldest benzodiazepines, and SSRIs. Benzodiazepines were used mainly discontinuously in oppose to significant continuous usage in middle age group (P 0.043).

The antiretroviral combination therapies (combined antiretroviral therapy [cART]) reduced by half the mortality. A low compliance to cART alters the virologic control and increases the morbimortality. If required, the therapeutic break should be the shortest possible, including the whole treatment (to limit the risk of viral resistance). The perioperative care should take into account the underlying conditions. During the preoperative period, the clinical picture could combine various complications: 1: respiratory impairment; 2: impairment of neuronal functions (related to viral factors, host response and environmental factors such as alcohol, drug addiction, HCV co-infection) inducing a cognitive dysfunction or a peripheral neuropathy; 3: lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance are the main metabolic cART-related side effects, responsible for atherosclerosis and coronaropathy; 4: major nutritional impairment. Anesthesia for HIV patients is almost the same than usual, without HIV-related contraindication to regional anesthesia. Anesthetic drugs can be associated to cART. The main restriction belongs to the protease inhibitors, which could affect the metabolic pathways of opioids, NSAIDs and benzodiazepines (over dosage risks). During the postoperative period, the follow-up should include the thromboembolism prevention (increased risk compared to main people), the cardiovascular side effects, the nutritional status and the continuation of the treatment.

It has been reported that PBR functions as an immunomodulator. The mechanisms of action of midazolam, a benzodiazepine, in the immune system in the CNS remain to be fully elucidated. We previously reported that interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 stimulates IL-6 synthesis from rat C6 glioma cells and that IL-1\u03b2 induces phosphorylation of inhibitory kappa B (I\u03baB), p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3. It has been shown that p38 MAP kinase is involved in IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-6 release from these cells.

However, IL-6 levels were not affected by PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2).

However, olanzapine has adverse effects, including a higher incidence of weight gain and metabolic disturbances, when compared with those of other antipsychotic agents. The mechanisms underlying these adverse events remain obscure. Female rats were orally administered olanzapine (2 mg/kg) or vehicle once a day for 2 weeks to ascertain if hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates olanzapine-induced weight gain and hyperphagia. Body weight and food intake in each rat were evaluated every day and every two days, respectively. After the termination of drug treatment, we measured the protein levels of AMPK and phosphorylated AMPK in the hypothalamus using western blot analyses. Olanzapine significantly increased body weight and food intake. The phosphorylation levels of AMPK were significantly elevated by olanzapine. These results suggest that activation of hypothalamic AMPK may mediate hyperphagia and weight gain induced by chronic treatment with olanzapine.", 
    "203": "The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of quercetin on CYP3A activity in vivo. An open, randomized, 2-period crossover experiment was performed in 18 healthy male volunteers. Genotyped data were available from a total of 165 participants. The allelic frequency was 52.5%. Every volunteer ingested orally 500 mg quercetin or placebo once a day for 13 consecutive days. On day 14, a single 7.5-mg midazolam tablet was administrated orally. The plasma concentrations of midazolam and 1-OH-midazolam were determined over 24 hours. The results showed that coadministration of quercetin in CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 individuals significantly decreased the area under the curve (AUC(0-12 h)) of midazolam (160.88 \u00b1 45.58 ng\u00b7h/mL vs 188.07 \u00b1 65.75 ng\u00b7h/mL, P < .05), significantly decreased the AUC(0-\u221e) of midazolam (165.46 \u00b1 47.15 ng\u00b7h/mL vs 211.84 \u00b1 75.80 ng\u00b7h/mL, P < .01), shortened t(1/2) (2.06 \u00b1 0.51 h vs 2.75 \u00b1 0.89 h, P < .01), and decreased t(max) significantly (0.48 \u00b1 0.36 h vs 1.06 \u00b1 0.69 h, P < .01), respectively. In conclusion, quercetin significantly induced CYP3A activity to substrate midazolam, and the induction was partly related to the CYP3A5 genotype, being more prominent in CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 individuals.", 
    "204": "Metabolic disturbances are a growing concern for the treatment of schizophrenia. As decreased activity and poor sleep quality are risk factors for metabolic disturbances, we investigated the activity and sleep patterns of schizophrenic patients using actigraphy. Seventy-three patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (mean age 29.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.2 years, 27 females) treated with olanzapine (n\u00a0=\u00a054) or risperidone (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were examined. Actigraphic recordings were obtained throughout seven consecutive days. The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to assess sleep and daytime sleepiness. Drug side effects were evaluated with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS). Mental status was rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS). The patients had lower mean 24\u00a0h-activity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and mean 10\u00a0h-daytime-activity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and longer time in bed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Higher PANSS scores, especially in the negative symptoms scale, were related to lower activity (r(s)\u00a0=\u00a0-0.508, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Higher depressive symptoms were related to lower mean 24\u00a0h-activity (r(s)\u00a0=\u00a0-0.233, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049), longer time in bed (r(s)\u00a0=\u00a00.315, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and higher AIS (r(s)\u00a0=\u00a00.377, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and ESS scores (r(s)\u00a0=\u00a00.321, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Healthy females presented higher activity than healthy males (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Similar but not significant gender differences were observed in the patients. These findings show that patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or risperidone exhibit low physical activity and altered sleep pattern which may promote metabolic side effects. These changes are linked to negative and depressive symptoms.", 
    "205": "The bispectral index (BIS) monitor records electroencephalogram waveforms and provides an objective measure of the hypnotic effect of a sedative drug on brain activity. The aim of this pilot study was to use the BIS monitor to evaluate the depth of procedural sedation in pediatric dental patients and to assess if the BIS monitor readings correlate with a validated pediatric sedation scale, the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS), in determining the level of sedation in these patients. Thirty-five pediatric dental patients requiring sedation were studied prospectively. A baseline BIS reading was obtained and during the procedure an independent observer recorded the BIS every 5 minutes. The operator, who was blinded to the BIS results, determined the UMSS scale at the same 5-minute interval. The patients were monitored postoperatively for 1 hour. There was a significant but moderate correlation between BIS values and UMSS scores (Spearman's rank correlation r \u200a=\u200a -0.574, P < .0001). Percentage of agreement and kappa coefficient using all the observations were also calculated. The percentage of agreement was 37.8%, the kappa coefficient was 0.18 (P < .0001), and the weighted kappa coefficient 0.26 (P < .0001). A lack of correlation was noted between the deeper levels of UMSS sedation scores and BIS values. This study demonstrated a significant correlation between BIS values and the UMSS score in pediatric dental patients undergoing mild to moderate sedation. Based on our results, it appears that the BIS monitor may be useful during mild or moderate sedations to establish the level of sedation objectively without the need to stimulate the patient.",

Today, technology developments enable the application of MS for the analysis of localized biomolecules on biological tissue surfaces. This technique is called MS imaging. MALDI imaging MS is a technique whereby thousands of compounds present in a tissue section are detected simultaneously without labeling. Although initially used for the detection of biomolecules such as peptides and proteins, this technology is also used today for drug detection. These characteristics make MS imaging an ideal technology that is perfectly adapted for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) studies. In fact, this technology facilitates the tracking of one or several administered drugs, as well as the metabolites that result from their assimilations. In this article, we will present the various possibilities that MALDI imaging MS approaches have to offer for the study of drugs and their metabolites using MS, MS/MS, FAST-SRM and MRM modes.

Data on potential harms are sparse and fragmented. Results do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS, but anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects.

It has been suggested that cognitive performance and memory processes are coupled with remodeling of pyramidal dendritic spine synapses in prefrontal cortex (PFC), and that reduced spine density and number of spine synapses in the medial PFC of PCP-treated rats may potentially underlie, at least partially, the cognitive dysfunction previously observed in this animal model. The present data show that the decrease in number of asymmetric (excitatory) spine synapses in layer II/III of PFC, previously noted at 1-week post PCP treatment also occurs, to a lesser degree, in layer V. The decrease in the number of spine synapses in layer II/III was sustained and persisted for at least 4 weeks, paralleling the observed cognitive deficits. Both acute and chronic treatment with the atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, starting at 1 week after PCP treatment at doses that restore cognitive function, reversed the asymmetric spine synapse loss in PFC of PCP-treated rats. Olanzapine had no significant effect on spine synapse number in saline-treated controls. These studies demonstrate that the effect of PCP on asymmetric spine synapse number in PFC lasts at least 4 weeks in this model. This spine synapse loss in PFC is reversed by acute treatment with olanzapine, and this reversal is maintained by chronic oral treatment, paralleling the time course of the restoration of the dopamine deficit, and normalization of cognitive function produced by olanzapine.",

    "219": "Participants, who were recently admitted inpatients with schizophrenia with an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with 40 mg of lurasidone, 120 mg of lurasidone, 15 mg of olanzapine (included to test for assay sensitivity), or placebo, dosed once daily. Efficacy was evaluated using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of the change from baseline to week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (as the primary efficacy measure) and Clinical Global Impressions severity (CGI-S) score (as the key secondary efficacy measure).", 
    "220": "Treatment with both doses of lurasidone or with olanzapine was associated with significantly greater improvement at week 6 on PANSS total score, PANSS positive and negative subscale scores, and CGI-S score compared with placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in mean PANSS total or CGI-S change scores for the lurasidone groups compared with the olanzapine group. With responders defined as those with an improvement of at least 20% on the PANSS, endpoint responder rates were significant compared with placebo for olanzapine only. The incidence of akathisia was higher with 120 mg of lurasidone (22.9%) than with 40 mg of lurasidone (11.8%), olanzapine (7.4%), or placebo (0.9%). The proportion of patients experiencing \u2265 7% weight gain was 5.9% for the lurasidone groups combined, 34.4% for the olanzapine group, and 7.0% for the placebo group.", 
    "221": "Lurasidone was an effective treatment for patients with acute schizophrenia. Safety assessments indicated a higher frequency of adverse events associated with 120 mg/day of lurasidone compared with 40 mg/day.", 
    "222": "Aiming to develop multitarget drugs for the anticancer treatment, a new class of chalcone-pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) conjugates linked through a 1,2,3-triazole moiety containing alkane spacers has been designed and synthesized. Combining these two core pharmacophore structures with modifications at A-C8/C-C2-position of PBD ring system yielded analogs with improved efficacy and have shown promising in vitro anticancer activity ranging from <0.1-2.92 \u03bcM. These PBD-conjugates caused G1 cell cycle arrest with effect on G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins such as Cyclin D1 and Cdk4. These conjugates also exhibited inhibitory effect on NF-kB, Bcl-XL proteins that play a vital role in breast cancer cell proliferation. These findings suggest that one of the compound 4d among this series is most effective and has potential for detailed investigations.", 
    "223": "Daily sedative interruption (DSI) may reduce excessive sedation and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation. It is not clear, however, how DSI affects sleep characteristics. For patients receiving mechanical ventilation, we compared the effect on sleep quality of DSI and continuous sedation (CS). Twenty-two mechanically ventilated patients who were receiving midazolam by infusion were randomly assigned to two groups, DSI (n = 11) or CS (n = 11). In the DSI group, sedatives were interrupted until the patients awoke and expressed discomfort, after which midazolam or opioids were administered intermittently as needed during the daytime (0600 to 2100 hours); during the night (2100 to 0600) midazolam was administered intravenously to maintain Ramsay sedation scale 4 to 5. In the CS group, the sedatives were titrated to obtain Ramsay sedation scale 4 to 5 throughout the day. The polysomnography of each patient was recorded continuously over a 24 hour period. Sleep stages were analysed using Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria. In the DSI group, the amount of stage 3 and 4 non-rapid eye movement sleep (slow wave sleep) was longer (6 vs 0 minutes, P = 0.04) and rapid eye movement sleep was longer than in CS (54 vs 0 minutes, P = 0.02). In the CS group, total sleep time during night-time was longer (8.7 vs 7.3 hours, P = 0.047) and frequency of arousal was lower (2.2 vs 4.4 event/hour, P = 0.03) than those in the DSI group. All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated abnormal sleep architecture, but, compared with CS, DSI increased the amount of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.", 
    "224": "Information provided by drug dependent patients might be incomplete and/or discrepant. Benzodiazepines are frequently abused, but not necessarily reported, even bythe treatment seeking population. The study aims to compare the self reported benzodiazepine use with a quick and effective urinalysis method. A total of 51 consecutive adult patients were included after an informed consent during their first visit to a tertiary care drug dependence treatment centre. The socio-demographic and clinical details were recorded on a semi-structured proforma. Patients were specifically asked for ever, current and recent benzodiazepine use and thereafter ten ml urine sample was collected to perform urinalysis with cassette test for benzodiazepines. The sample, predominantly males, had a mean age of 37.86 +/-10.46 years. The common primary drugs of use were heroin (52.9%), alcohol (23.5%) and other opioids (21.6%). Drug use was uninterrupted in most of users (72.5%) and ranged from one to forty years. The recent benzodiazepine use was reported by 21.6% of all users whereas urinalysis by cassette test was positive in 50.9% of the treatment seekers. Denial among users was 69.2% and denial among negative self report was 45%. A poor level of agreement (K) was found between results of self-report and urinalysis for all the treatment seekers. Self report of benzodiazepine use is highly questionable among treatment seekers. The urinalysis with cassette test is a quick objective method which is recommended for routine screening.", 
    "225": "The aim of the study was to describe the contemporary practice of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in Norway.", 
    "226": "A 42- item questionnaire on the practice of ECT was sent to all the 125 Norwegian psychiatric hospitals, district psychiatric centers, and child and adolescent psychiatric units in 2004.", 
    "227": "A total of 67 (54%) psychiatric units responded, including 26 (67%) of 39 psychiatric hospitals, 32 (46%) of 69 district psychiatric centers, and 9 (53%) of 17 child and adolescents units. Trainee psychiatrists mostly administered ECT, with or without supervision, but underwent a training program before administering ECT. Written informed consent was used in 50% of institutions providing ECT. Right unilateral electrode placement was preferred but with variations in dosage strategies. The practice in most of the departments was to discontinue some classes of psychotropics before ECT, mostly benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants. Antidepressants and antipsychotics were most often continued. Continuation/maintenance and ambulatory ECT were used. Most patients benefited from ECT. Headache and memory impairment were frequent but seldom were serious adverse effects.", 
    "228": "The administration of ECT in Norway in 2004 was mostly in accordance with international guidelines. All institutions used modified ECT and brief pulse machines, and unilateral ECT was the preferred electrode placement. National guidelines should be developed, as there were great variations in practice among the hospitals."
