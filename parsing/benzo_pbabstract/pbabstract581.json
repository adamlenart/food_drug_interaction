    "0": "The reduction of vanadate (+5V) to vanadyl (+4V) was demonstrated by ESR spectra in the presence of methylene-blue, chlorpromazine, imipramine and dosulepin, but not in the presence of benzodiazepines and Li+. Bleomycine forms an (inactive) complex with +4V which may explain the disinhibition of the brain microsomal Na+-K+ ATPase in the presence of vanadyl. The reduction of +5V to +4V by antidepressants would diminish the binding of +5V to the ATPase and could account for some of the therapeutic action of the drugs in manic-depressive illness.", 
    "1": "Studies employing conditioned operant behavior of squirrel monkeys, rabbits and pigeons have demonstrated that the neuroactive peptides thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), substance P (SP) and neurotensin (NT) produce marked behavioral effects under a wide range of procedures. These compounds appear to be particularly active when given in combination with other drugs. The co-administration of TRH with chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital and ethanol potentiates the effects of these agents on punished behavior. Under other conditions SP can reverse the effects of chlordiazepoxide, whereas NT enhances the effects of haloperidol. Neither TRH, SP nor NT are behaviorally active at doses that produced significant interactions. These results support the view that neuropeptides exert modulatory effects on various neurotransmitter systems. An understanding of peptide-drug interactions should contribute to the development of new compounds with enhanced psychopharmacological efficacy and minimal side effects.", 
    "2": "The effect of orally administered 1,5-dihydroxy-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)- acetyl-6H-pyrido[2,3-b]-1,4-benzodiazepin-6-one dihydrochloride (pirenzepine dihydrochloride, LS-519 Cl, Gastrozepin) on the postprandial secretion of pancreatic juice and the duodenal pH was studied in conscious dogs. An inhibition of the normal increase of the postprandial pancreatic secretion was observed. A possible indirect role of endogenous secretin and a cholinergic enteropancreatic reflex was discussed.", 
    "3": "Changes in plasma histamine levels 2 min (t1) and 10 min (t2) after the intravenous injection of 0.2 mg X kg-1 midazolam were measured in 10 subjects at risk of releasing histamine (group I) and compared with those of 15 other subjects free from any risk of releasing histamine (group II). There was mean increases in plasma histamine levels of 0.78 ng X ml-1 between t0 and t1 (p less than 0.01), and of 0.41 ng X ml-1 between t0 and t2 (p less than 0.01) in group I; they only rose by 0.18 ng X ml-1 between t0 and t2 (p less than 0.01) in group II. The only statistically significant variation between the two groups was that at t1 (p less than 0.03): plasma histamine levels rose higher at the second minute in those cases at risk. This was a rather small increase, within physiological limits, and without any clinical or haemodynamic manifestation.", 
    "4": "A search of the French and English language literature of the last 20 years (1964-1984) yielded 975 cases of immediate anaphylactoid reactions due to anaesthetic drugs given parenterally. The accident mechanism was confirmed in only half the patients, and nearly always at a later date. The immunoallergological tests most often used in the diagnostic process were skin tests and Prausnitz-K\u00fcstner tests. Although all drugs could be responsible for an anaphylactic reaction, the greatest number of cases was due to muscle relaxants (51%) and hypnotic drugs (42.3%). The signs most often described were cutaneous, cardiovascular, respiratory and occasionally gastro-intestinal. Whilst hypnotic drugs were responsible for cutaneous signs, muscle relaxants gave cardiovascular signs. A past history of drug allergy was found in 37% of cases, and atopy in 38%; virtually all patients had already had one or more anaesthetics.", 
    "5": "The mutagenic activity of Flunitrazepam, the active ingredient of the drug Rohypnol, has been investigated by using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. A dose-related mutagenic effect was observed on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100 either in the absence or in the presence of a rat liver microsomal fraction (S9) as in vitro metabolic activation system. By adopting a modification of the Salmonella test, the mutagenicity of urines from rats or patients treated with the drug was evaluated. In these cases mutagenic activity was detected toward the Salmonella strains TA 98 and TA 100 both in presence and in absence of the metabolic activation system. The data indicate that Flunitrazepam and/or its urinary metabolites can induce both base-pair substitutions or frame-shift point mutations.", 
    "6": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788, were examined on analgesia induced by morphine after central (intracerebroventricular, i.c.v., or intrathecal, i.t.) and systemic administration. Analgesia was assessed in squirrel monkeys trained to respond under an electric shock titration procedure and in mice using the radiant heat tail-flick test. Central and systemic administration of morphine produced antinociceptive effects that were antagonized by 0.1 mg/kg of naloxone in both species. Ro 15-1788 antagonized the effects of morphine after central (i.c.v. or i.t.) administration but did not alter the effects of morphine given by the systemic route. This novel interaction suggests that Ro 15-1788 may be useful in pharmacologically separating neural substrates subserving opiate analgesia.", 
    "7": "The reversible specific binding of [3H]diazepam was observed by a radioligand method in homogenates of cultured cells of mouse glioblastoma. It was characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd = 91 +/- 5 nM and the number of maximal binding sites (Bmax) of 1006 +/- 100 fmol/mg protein. The half-saturation and half-degradation periods for the ligand-receptor complex were 15 and 10 s, respectively. The specific binding sites from glioblastoma are similar to the peripheral-type receptors as their inhibition constant for Ro 5-4864 Ki = 16 nM and that for clonazepam Ki = 30 microM.", 
    "8": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a naturally occurring phospholipid, is a potent activator of various biological processes, including platelet aggregation. The mechanisms by which PAF acts are largely unknown, partly because of the lack of specific inhibitors for PAF-elicited responses. It was found that in washed human platelets the psychotropic triazolobenzodiazepine drugs alprazolam and triazolam potently inhibited PAF-induced changes in shape, aggregation, and secretion. The effects were specific for PAF activation, since the responses of human platelets to adenosine diphosphate, thrombin, epinephrine, collagen, arachidonate, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were not inhibited by the triazolobenzodiazepines. These psychotropic drugs should be useful in investigating the possibility that PAF or PAF-like phospholipids play a role in neuronal function and in elucidating biochemical mechanisms activated specifically by PAF in a variety of cells.", 
    "9": "The kinetic characteristics of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNT) and [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]beta-CCE) were compared in three different areas of the human brain. As revealed by the Scatchard plot analysis the total number of binding sites labelled by [3H]beta-CCE was markedly lower than that labelled by [3H]FNT. In fact, only 50% of the binding sites for [3H]FNT were also available for [3H]beta-CCE. This finding indicates that in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of the human brain at least 50% of the benzodiazepine recognition sites are that of Type II. This conclusion is further supported by the evidence that CL-218872 (5 X 10(-6) M), a specific ligand for Type I benzodiazepine recognition site, inhibited [3H]FNT binding by 50% in membranes from the above brain areas. The results suggest that two distinct types of benzodiazepines recognition sites are present in different areas of the human brain.", 
    "10": "Changes in hippocampal calcium-binding protein (CaBP) were examined in rats given kindling stimuli via electrodes chronically implanted in the midline commissural pathway. CaBP levels decreased progressively and were significantly lower (16.6%) than controls after only 10 kindling trials. The maximum fall (33%) was achieved prior to the production of stage 5 motor seizures and additional kindling-induced seizures produced no further decline. Induction of motor seizures with pentylenetetrazol had no effect upon hippocampal CaBP levels. Diazepam treatment during the course of kindling significantly increased the number of stimulation trials required to produce stage 5 motor seizures but did not inhibit the fall in CaBP. Diazepam treatment of fully kindled rats was effective in blocking generalized motor seizures without causing any restoration of the depleted levels of CaBP. Diphenylhydantoin was neither effective during the course of kindling nor in modifying the effect of further stimulations in fully kindled rats. These data indicate that the highly specific decrease in hippocampal CaBP, previously demonstrated to be localized to dentate granule cells and their processes following kindling-induced epilepsy, does not result from the expression of full tonic-clonic (stage 5) motor seizures. The loss of CaBP may be a biochemical factor contributing either to the predisposition of neuronal tissue to seizure activity or to a protective attempt to overcome the deleterious effect of repeated high-frequency stimulation.", 
    "11": "The structure-affinity relationship of benzodiazepine receptor ligands for binding to their receptors was investigated by measuring the potency of 41 benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine analogues and of 9 non-benzodiazepines for inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebellar or hippocampal membranes. It was found that a chloro or a fluoro substitutent in position 2' enhanced whereas substituents in position 3 and substituents larger than a methyl group in position 1 of the benzodiazepine ring system reduced the potency of benzodiazepines for inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in cerebellum or hippocampus. In addition, several benzodiazepines could be identified which have a higher affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellum than for those in hippocampus. A selectivity of benzodiazepines for their receptors in cerebellum seems to be caused not only by certain substituents in position 1 but also by a chloro group in position 2' and together with this substituent by a hydroxy group in position 3.", 
    "12": "Benzodiazepine binding sites in rat pituitary gland were investigated by equilibrium binding assays in vitro. Using [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FNM), specific binding was demonstrated in both anterior and neurointermediate lobes. Clonazepam and Ro 5-4864 were used to discriminate the binding to central and peripheral-type sites. Both types of binding site were found to be relatively concentrated in the neurointermediate lobe. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that Kd values for [3H]FNM for the two types of sites were similar to those reported in other areas.", 
    "13": "The interactions of a steroid anaesthetic, alphaxalone, with the GABA receptor-ionophore complex were investigated by two different experimental approaches. In the rat cuneate nucleus slice, alphaxalone (0.1-10 microM) potentiated depolarizing responses to superfused GABA and muscimol, but not those to glycine. The potentiating effect of alphaxalone was unaltered by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Alphaxalone (0.1-30 microM) also enhanced [3H]muscimol binding to rat brain membranes in the presence of Cl-ions; the enhancing effect on [3H]muscimol binding was abolished by Triton X-100. Analysis of binding curves for [3H]muscimol indicated that the steroid anaesthetic increases the affinity for [3H]muscimol of low affinity binding sites; this property is shared by pentobarbitone. The physiologically inactive beta-hydroxy isomer of the steroid was without activity in either of the experimental situations at 30 microM. It is suggested that alphaxalone and pentobarbitone share a common mode of action on the GABA system, which may be relevant to the mechanisms by which these drugs produce anaesthesia.", 
    "14": "The purification of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors from the rat brain was employed by the affinity column using a new benzodiazepine, 1012-S, as immobilized ligand. The 1012-S has a aliphatic primary amino group and exhibited an extremely high potency for displacing [3H]flunitrazepam binding to solubilized benzodiazepine receptor preparation (IC50 = 6.0 X 10(-11) M). This benzodiazepine affinity gel retained almost all of the solubilized GABA receptors from synaptic membranes applied to the column, and 25.6% of the receptor was eluted bio-specifically following the application of 1 mM 1012-S. The highest purification fold thus obtained was 4576 (specific activity: 0.99 nmol/mg protein). Furthermore, the successive application of 1-2 M NaSCN also resulted the elution of a highly enriched GABA receptor (specific activity: 0.41 nmol/mg protein; purification fold: 1889). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic profiles of the bio-specifically eluted fraction with 1012-S showed the existence of two major bands having the molecular weights of approximately 48,500 and 54,500, in which the former band was selectively photoaffinity-labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam. On the other hand, it was found that the non-specifically eluted fraction with NaSCN contained 4 additional minor bands having molecular weights of 41,000 to 51,000. These results indicate that GABA receptor of the rat brain is coupled, at least in part, with benzodiazepine receptor and is readily purified by the use of highly specific benzodiazepine affinity gel, 1012-S-acetamide adipic hydrazide Sepharose 4B. The present results also suggest that the purified GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex may contain two different kinds of subunits having the molecular weights of 48,000 and 54,500, in which the former subunit may possess benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "15": "A 14-year-old White boy was recently admitted to the Universitas Hospital, Bloemfontein, with an adrenergic/antimuscarinic syndrome following drug overdose. The causation of the syndrome and successful management with physostigmine salicylate are discussed.", 
    "16": "Mice were implanted with chronic indwelling cannulae in the lateral cerebral ventricle. The behavioral interaction of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of diazepam with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.t.) injections of adenosine or 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) was examined on spontaneous locomotor activity. Concurrent injections of i.c.v.t. adenosine and i.p. diazepam, at doses which had no significant effect on locomotor activity when given alone, acted synergistically to produce a marked depression of locomotor activity. In contrast, i.p. injections of diazepam did not potentiate the locomotor depressant effects of i.c.v.t. injections of NECA, an uptake resistant analog of adenosine. These findings support the possibility of specific benzodiazepine-adenosine interactions in the central nervous system.", 
    "17": "The daily administration of diazepam (10 mg/kg i.v.) in rats elicited tolerance to the sedative effect within 2-3 days, parallel to the emerging of a stimulatory syndrome. In the EEG, the latter was accompanied by a progressive replacement of the trains of spindles with 25-30 Hz low amplitude waves. No clear signs of tolerance to the myorelaxant effect of diazepam were observed. After 10 days of treatment, the drug was discontinued. Thereafter, a single administration of diazepam elicited a stimulatory syndrome and EEG desynchronization throughout the 15 days of withdrawal. [3H]diazepam binding studies, performed in frozen-thawed membrane preparations incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min, showed a decrease of KD values in tolerant rats up to 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. In parallel, a reduction in the ability of GABA to enhance [3H]diazepam binding, as well as to protect [3H]diazepam recognition sites from thermoinactivation at 60 degrees C, were found in tolerant rats up to 15 days after drug termination. These data suggest that a modification in the regulatory activity of GABA on benzodiazepine recognition sites might underlie the tolerance to the sedative effects and EEG changes of benzodiazepines.", 
    "18": "The symptom of insomnia concerns not only psychiatrists, but other physicians as well. Most cases of insomnia resolve with the passage of time or when the underlying medical or psychiatric condition is treated. For situational insomnias or psychophysiologic insomnias, consider nonpharmacologic interventions before prescribing a sedative-hypnotic. When a sedative-hypnotic is indicated, the BZs are the drugs of choice because of their better margin of safety and lower potential for abuse. In most cases, limit the use of a sedative-hypnotic to several days to a few weeks.", 
    "19": "Effects of gamma-oryzanol were studied on gastric lesions induced by both conditioned emotional stimuli (CES) and REM sleep deprivations and on the facilitation of small intestinal propulsive activity by CES in mice. The CES were given by the communication box method, and the REM sleep deprivations were performed by a modified flower pot method. The incidence of gastric lesions in responder mice induced by CES was reduced by twice p.o. administrations at 6 hr interval of gamma-oryzanol at 200 and 500 mg/kg, oxazolam at 2 mg/kg and atropine at 1-10 mg/kg. The incidence in sender mice was also reduced by gamma-oryzanol at 200 and 500 mg/kg. In addition, the incidence of gastric lesions induced by REM sleep deprivation was also reduced by single administration of gamma-oryzanol at 100 and 200 mg/kg and oxazolam at 5 mg/kg. The facilitation of small intestinal propulsive activity in responder mice induced by CES was suppressed by gamma-oryzanol at 100 and 200 mg/kg and atropine at 10 mg/kg. These results indicate that gamma-oryzanol has an antiulcerative action on gastric lesions induced by CES and REM sleep deprivation, and it has a suppressive action on the facilitation of intestinal propulsion induced by CES.", 
    "20": "A five-drug parenteral antiemetic regimen was administered to 17 patients experiencing intractable vomiting following treatment with cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy. The five-drug treatment consisted of metoclopramide (1 mg/kg iv), diphenhydramine (50 mg im), dexamethasone (20 mg iv), diazepam (5 mg iv), and thiethylperazine (10 mg im), given together at the initiation of the regimen and repeated on a predefined schedule. The number of emetic episodes, duration of nausea and vomiting, and adverse effects were recorded by trained observers. In addition, all patients completed standardized evaluation forms on the day after treatment. Thirteen patients (76%) remained free of vomiting and three (18%) had only one emesis after beginning the study treatment. No serious toxicity was encountered. We conclude that intractable vomiting induced by cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy can be successfully terminated with an aggressive parenteral antiemetic regimen.", 
    "21": "Eight hundred pacemaker have been placed under general anaesthesia associating flunitrazepam-fentanyl, with a good comfort and safety for those patients old and often weak.", 
    "22": "The authors report their experience of regional block using anaesthesia of the brachial plexus by the axillary approach. 1 500 axillary blocks have been done since 1976. They perfect their technology and report their results. Because of the innocuity of regional block and its simplicity, they use it in seventy per cent of superior limb acute or regular surgery.", 
    "23": "Bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia produces operating conditions for over two hours. The onset of sensory block is rapid. Motor blockade is incomplete in 13% at the cases. The quality of anesthesia was judged very satisfactory. Adapting dosage to size (0.1 mg X cm-1) decreases the risk of excessive spread of the block. Simultaneous administration of dihydroergotamine and flunitrazepam enhances cardio-vascular stability and acceptance by patients.", 
    "24": "Two groups of 20 women randomly distributed underwent general anaesthesia based on dextromoramide and droperidol. Midazolam was given 0.2 mg X kg-1 in the first group, 0.4 mg X kg-1 in the second. Induction was considered satisfactory in more than 90 p. cent of patients in both groups (NS). Midazolam produced a decrease of systolic blood pressure of 9 mm Hg in group I (p less than 0,001) and 11 mm Hg in group II (p less than 0,001) as well as a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg (p less than 0,025) and 7 mm Hg (p less than 0,005) respectively. Heart rate decreased significantly only in group II (by 4 c X mn-1, p less than 0,01). These alterations were similar in both groups and did not reach physiologic importance. Maintenance of anesthesia as well as recovery were uneventful in all cases. Higher doses of midazolam reduced only slightly the dose of the neuroleptic. Its is concluded that midazolam is a good induction agent neuroleptic-analgesic anaesthesia. The use of more than 0.2 mg X kg-1 is of no particular interest but is well tolerated.", 
    "25": "Serum protein and lipid concentrations as well as the serum protein binding of propranolol, diazepam and phenytoin were measured in normal weight and obese volunteers. Concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) in the obese subjects were double that of the lean controls. Conversely, concentrations of high density lipoproteins (HDL) were decreased in the obese group. The serum binding of propranolol was increased in the obese subjects and correlated with serum AAG concentrations. Diazepam binding was slightly decreased in the obese as a result of lower serum albumin concentrations and elevated free fatty acids. The binding of phenytoin was comparable in all of the volunteers. These findings point out some of the complex pathophysiologic changes associated with obesity which may in turn influence drug disposition and hence drug therapy in the obese patient.", 
    "26": "The pharmacokinetics of clobazam were studied in six healthy volunteers and six age and sex matched enzyme-induced epileptic patients. In the epileptic patients the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for clobazam was significantly smaller and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for N-desmethylclobazam was significantly greater than in the healthy volunteers. Plasma N-desmethylclobazam concentrations were found to be much higher than those of clobazam in the epileptic patients, raising the possibility that the antiepileptic properties of clobazam are to be attributed more to its metabolite than the parent drug.", 
    "27": "The authors administered clobazam (CLB) to treat status epilepticus in 16 patients from 3 to 62 years old. Status epilepticus was of absence type (6 cases), myoclonic-absence type (1 case), myoclonic type (1 case), tonic (1 case) and elementary or complex partial (7 cases). In all patients consciousness was sufficiently retained to allow ingestion of the drug. CLB administration was performed under EEG monitoring, in a single oral dose averaging 1.0 mg/kg. In 15 patients, the status was stopped after a period ranging from 19 to 31 min without significant sedation or other side effects. In one patient a somatomotor status epilepticus, lasting 8 days, terminated 6 h after drug administration. It is well known that the efficacy of a drug on status epilepticus depends on the clinical context and semiological form of the status. Nevertheless, the authors conclude that the pharmacokinetic properties of CLB, its mild sedative effects and ease of administration, make this a useful drug in the management of some forms of status epilepticus.", 
    "28": "Diazepam and hyoscine are known to have amnesic effects when administered intravenously. Nevertheless, they achieve these effects by entirely different neurochemical mechanisms, and so the question arises whether they can be differentiated in terms of their effects upon different categories of encoding operations. Sixteen normal volunteers received intravenous administrations of diazepam, hyoscine, and saline following a double-blind procedure. Both drugs completely eliminated the subjects' ability to discriminate between successive lists of words in a test of recognition memory. Moreover, both drugs also impaired the subjects' ability to reject homophones or synonyms of presented words. Thus, both diazepam and hyoscine appeared to impair the use of list tags, phonemic coding, and semantic coding in storing individual stimulus items in long-term memory.", 
    "29": "Sixty children, aged 1-12 years, were investigated with regard to gastric pH and volume before general anaesthesia. Thirty children (group D) received diazepam 0.75 mg/kg b.w. rectally 1 h before anaesthesia. Thirty children (group L) received a \"lytic cocktail\" (pethidine 28 mg, promethazine 7 mg, chlorpromazine 7 mg per ml) 0.05 ml/kg b.w. intramuscularly 1 h before anaesthesia. The pH values were significantly higher and the amount of gastric juice was significantly lower in group L compared to group D. The number of children in group L with gastric juice volume exceeding 0.4 ml/kg and the number of children with pH less than 2.5 was significantly smaller compared to group D. The number of children with both gastric pH less than 2.5 and gastric juice volume greater than 0.4 ml/kg was significantly smaller in the group receiving \"lytic cocktail\" intramuscularly compared to the group receiving diazepam rectally. Bile-stained gastric contents was not related to the gastric pH.", 
    "30": "The reinforcing efficacy of flurazepam (15 and 30 mg) in humans was assessed using an experimental choice procedure. Twelve healthy volunteers were tested in two 3-week choice experiments, in which each dose of the drug was compared to placebo. Subjective effects of the drug (and placebo) were monitored using the Profile of Mood States and a 49-item version of the Addiction Research Center Inventory. The lower dose of flurazepam was chosen equally as often as placebo and produced no significant subjective effects. The higher dose (30 mg) was chosen significantly less often than chance, and produced typical tranquilizer-like effects (e.g., sedation). These results are consistent with previous results using other benzodiazepines such as diazepam and lorazepam, and suggest that the reinforcing efficacy of these drugs in normal volunteers is low.", 
    "31": "Increasing numbers of individuals with a diagnosis of cocaine abuse (DSM-III, 305.6) are seeking medical and psychiatric care. The majority of users inhale the drug in powdered form, as cocaine is rapidly absorbed by mucous membranes. The patterns of use resemble those for the use of alcohol and marijuana: recreational, intensified, circumstantial, and compulsive. When cocaine is taken intravenously or by freebasing, individuals are much more vulnerable to developing a compulsive pattern of use that could lead to an organic delusional syndrome. Cocaine causes systemic effects that are similar to those of amphetamine, but they have a much shorter duration of action. Blood pressure, heart rate, feelings of \"pleasantness\" and \"stimulation\" are increased, and hunger is decreased. Acute tolerance may develop over hours of continuous use, but it disappears after a short period of abstinence (overnight). In psychomotor testing, performance that is impaired by fatigue is restored to baseline levels. Users like cocaine because they feel more alert, energetic, sociable, and sensual. However, these positive feelings are commonly followed by anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue, and craving more cocaine. Chronic intoxication is always associated with adverse psychosocial sequelae. Treatment initially must be directed toward the patient's stopping all use of cocaine, employing strategies such as contingency contracts, urinalysis, family intervention, the assignment of financial control to others, or hospitalization. Several psychopharmacologic agents are helpful as an adjunct to a comprehensive treatment plan. Overdoses of cocaine are treated by diazepam and propranolol. Antidepressant medications, both TCAs and MAOIs, often help relieve the symptoms of depression that emerge when chronic use of cocaine is discontinued. Classical and operant conditioning contribute to craving for the drug and opportunities to extinguish these factors are valuable in preventing relapse. Compulsive users often have an Axis II diagnosis of borderline or narcissistic personality disorder, which require long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy.", 
    "32": "Midazolam, administered intramuscularly was compared with papaveretum and hyoscine for premedication in patients undergoing gynaecological surgery. Midazolam proved to be a satisfactory agent for premedication compared with papaveretum and hyoscine, producing a similar degree of sedation and anxiolysis, but causing significantly more anterograde amnesia.", 
    "33": "The effects of exchange transfusion with an oxygen-carrying resuscitation fluid, Fluosol DA 20% or stroma-free hemoglobin, on the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, diazepam, penicillin, and sulfamethazine were studied in rats. After transfusion with Fluosol DA 20% or stroma-free hemoglobin the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, diazepam, and penicillin were unchanged when compared to control animals. After transfusion with Fluosol DA 20%, the t 1/2 of sulfamethazine was increased from 3.15 +/- 0.56 to 7.65 +/- 2.41 hr (p less than 0.05) and the Vd was increased from 60.7 +/- 17.5 to 152 +/- 16 ml (p less than 0.05). In contrast, after transfusion with stroma-free hemoglobin, the AUC of sulfamethazine was decreased from 129 +/- 28 to 80.5 +/- 27.7 micrograms X h X ml-1 (p less than 0.05) and there was an increase in Cl from 12.2 +/- 3.4 to 20.2 +/- 6.0 ml X h-1 (p less than 0.05) and Vd from 60.1 +/- 11.8 to 132 +/- 49 ml (p less than 0.05). The reason for these alterations is not clear. Fluosol DA 20% and stroma-free hemoglobin may alter the acetylation of sulfamethazine.", 
    "34": "Diazepam followed by succinylcholine chloride was administered intramuscularly to 26 healthy mature female alligators on 2 occasions. The mean diazepam dosage was 0.37 mg/kg (range, 0.22 mg/kg to 0.62 mg/kg) and the mean succinylcholine chloride dosage was 0.24 mg/kg (range, 0.14 mg/kg to 0.37 mg/kg). This drug combination reduced stress and allowed adequate immobilization for restraint and handling. The reduced drug volume, low dosage of succinylcholine chloride required, short induction period, maintenance of respiration, and adequate degree of immobilization make this drug combination a good alternative to the use of muscle relaxants alone in chemical restraint of alligators.", 
    "35": "The presence of a retrograde amnesia, when caused by medications given prior to a medical procedure, can pose the medicolegal question of informed consent. This study investigated the retrograde amnesic effects of intravenous diazepam administered prior to gastrointestinal endoscopy. No significant retrograde amnesia was found in case subjects when compared with controls.", 
    "36": "The present study was undertaken in order to describe 16 more patients suffering from startle-induced epileptic seizures and to clarify further the possible therapeutic activity of benzodiazepines in this rare reflex epilepsy. The interictal and ictal electroclinical data of 16 epileptic children or adolescents have been detailed. A CT-scan was performed in 10 patients; six of them showed an atrophy of the mesial surface of one or both hemispheres (\"mesial hypodensity\"). Benzodiazepine was associated with the previous antiepileptic treatment in the 16 ineffectively treated patients. Clonazepam was administered in three patients; one of them was completely unresponsive and two became seizure-free for a mean of 16.5 months but complained of drowsiness or ataxia. Clobazam was administered in 13 patients; 15.4% of them were completely unresponsive, 23.1% experienced drug resistance, and 61.5% obtained a good control (91.5% reduction of the reflex seizures) for a mean of 22.75 months. In spite of a possible loss of therapeutic activity, the appearance of very few unfavorable side effects and the presence of favorable side effects (\"psychomotor arousal\") make clobazam therapy important in the treatment of patients suffering from startle epilepsy.", 
    "37": "Cynomolgus monkeys were anesthetized with either intravenous (IV) ketamine hydrochloride, IV ketamine and intramuscular (IM) diazepam, IM methohexital sodium and IM pentobarbital sodium, or endotracheal halothane. Intraocular pressure, aqueous humor flow rate (F), anterior chamber volume, corneal endothelial transfer coefficient (Ka), and anterior chamber elimination coefficient (Ke) were determined noninvasively, using applanation tonometry, keratometry, pachymetry, and fluorophotometry. Arterial blood gases (ABG), acid-base balance, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored. The IOP was highest with ketamine and lowest with pentobarbital. The F and Ke were about 30% lower with halothane than with the other regimens, while Ka was highest with ketamine. The ABG and MAP were within normal physiologic limits with the three noninhalation regimens; pH was within normal limits with all four regimens. The MAP was lowest and PO2 highest with halothane, while pH was highest with pentobarbital.", 
    "38": "The current study was undertaken to determine whether the same doses (mg/kg) of 5 mg/ml of midazolam hydrochloride and 2.5 mg/ml of midazolam maleate are required for the induction of anesthesia. Midazolam hydrochloride and midazolam maleate were compared in a prospective double-blind fashion, in which both cardiopulmonary and sedative effects were measured in 12 patients who required repeated anesthesia for serial gynecologic radium insertions. The results showed no significant differences in clinical activity between midazolam maleate and the newer preparation, midazolam hydrochloride. Time of onset, recovery time, lack of venous irritation, and stability of cardiopulmonary variables when using the hydrochloride were essentially the same with the maleate.", 
    "39": "The binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) to specific membrane sites in guinea pig brain was rapid, reversible, and saturable, and was dependent upon protein concentration, pH, and temperature. Mass law analysis of the binding data for cortical membranes indicated that NBMPR bound with high affinity to a single class of sites at which the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for NBMPR was 0.10-0.25 nM and which possessed a maximum binding capacity (Bmax) per mg of protein of 300 fmol of NBMPR. Kinetic analysis of the site-specific binding of NBMPR yielded an independent estimate of the KD of 0.16 nM. A relatively homogeneous subcellular distribution of the sites for NBMPR was found in cortical tissue. Recognized inhibitors of nucleoside transport were potent, competitive inhibitors of the binding of NBMPR in guinea pig CNS membranes whereas benzodiazepines and phenothiazines have low affinity for the sites. NBMPR sites in guinea pig cortical membranes have characteristics similar to those for NBMPR in human erythrocytes, the occupation of which is associated with inhibition of nucleoside transport. The comparable affinities for a range of agents for sites in human erythrocytes and guinea pig CNS membranes suggest that NBMPR also binds to transport inhibitory elements of the guinea pig CNS nucleoside transport system. It is proposed that the study of the binding of NBMPR provides an effective method by which to examine drug interactions with the membrane-located nucleoside transport system in CNS membranes.", 
    "40": "Fifty adult patients with partial motor status epilepticus were treated with a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of diphenylhydantoin (DPH), 20 mg/kg body weight at a rate of 1 mg/kg/min. Seizures were controlled in 32 patients (64%) during the injection or within the following hour; in 13 of them previous (i.v.) injections out of benzodiazepines had been ineffective. DPH was effective in 10 patients of 11 with a previous history of epileptic seizures and without problems of consciousness during their epileptic status. In contrast, 13 failures out of 18 concern occasional status in patients deeply comatose because of head trauma, neurosurgical operation or intracerebral hemorrhage. Total plasmatic levels of DPH, when measured 24 h after the injection, were found between 38 mumol/l in all patients, and were in the range of 40 mumol/l-100 mumol/l in 77% of cases. Adverse effects were: pain at the injection site (6 cases), horizontal nystagmus during injection (5 cases), transient cerebellar symptoms (3 cases). This study confirms that single loading doses of DPH can maintain DPH plasmatic levels within the therapeutic range during 24 h, with minor or transient side effects, provided that cardiovascular contra-indications are respected.", 
    "41": "After adaptation to a 23-hr water deprivation regimen, under which rats were allowed a daily 1-hr water rehydration session, they were injected (SC) with 1 or 2 drugs presession and given 1.5% NaCl solution to drink in place of water. Midazolam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) increased the intake of 1.5% NaCl solution as did Ro 15-1788 (2.5-10.0 mg/kg). This confirmed a previously noted agonist effect of midazolam and partial agonist action of Ro 15-1788. When injected in combination with midazolam, Ro 15-1788 (2.5-10.0 mg/kg) antagonized the effect of midazolam. CGS 8216 (2.5-20.0 mg/kg) revealed no partial agonist action on the NaCl solution ingestion procedure nor did it block the effect of midazolam.", 
    "42": "It is important to understand both the kinetic and the dynamic implications of dosing TCAs and BZs in the elderly, for whom these drugs are frequently prescribed. The TCAs are used to treat responsive signs and symptoms including such somatic complaints as chest pain, dizziness, and arthralgias, as well as the endogenous signs such as loss of appetite with associated weight loss, psychomotor retardation, loss of libido, and insomnia. The pharmacokinetic studies of TCAs such as desipramine and nortriptyline have shown few, if any, age-related changes. The dose required for responsivity is significantly reduced for both TCAs (desipramine and nortriptyline) in the elderly, which may suggest increased end-organ responsiveness. The major recommendations for treatment of depression with nortriptyline in the elderly are (1) to administer small doses in order to avoid side effects, and (2) to expect a longer response time for the antidepressant effect than in young and middle-aged depressed patients. Although the BZs are extensively prescribed in the elderly, primarily for insomnia and anxiety, the physiologic and biochemical changes of aging alter the kinetics and dynamics of these extensively metabolized and slowly eliminated drugs. Based on the kinetic data and information in Tables 1 and 2, the relatively sensitive elderly population should receive a reduced dosage. Careful evaluation of the patient and the kinetic profile of the agent employed will ensure safe use of these drugs. A clear understanding of anxiety and respect for the alterations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these agents in the elderly will allow the physician to prescribe the BZs wisely. As with the TCAs, remember to administer doses of BZs that are reduced by 50 to 75 per cent of the usual recommended doses for young and middle-aged individuals and to increase dosage in small increments. Ultimately, sound, scientifically based, clinical judgment that considers the needs of the patient is the best guide for the selection of an appropriate BZ.", 
    "43": "A method of measuring carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-10,11-EPOX) has been developed and used to monitor plasma concentrations in children suffering from various forms of epilepsy. Children stabilised on standard doses of CBZ alone showed a ratio of CBZ-10,11-EPOX/CBZ of 18.92 +/- 8.08, expressed as a percentage of the CBZ concentration, while those on multiple-drug therapy (with the exception of benzodiazepines and phenobarbitone) showed both increased values of CBZ-10,11-EPOX/CBZ ratio and increased absolute concentrations of CBZ-10,11-EPOX in plasma. These changes correlated with clinical side-effects which could not be attributed to CBZ itself or to the other drugs administered concurrently.", 
    "44": "A comparative study was made of monotherapy for grand mal seizures among four groups of children between three and 14 years of age. The first-choice anticonvulsants were phenobarbitone (N = 159), phenytoin (N = 185), carbamazepine (N = 178) and sodium valproate (N = 63). The proportions in each group with a three-year remission of seizures were, respectively, 22, 34, 40 and 16 per cent. The results were better for children with primary grand mal (25, 39, 45 and 21 per cent) and were worse for those with secondary grand mal (3, 21, 25 and 4 per cent), respectively. 119 of the children obtained no reduction in seizure frequency, and for them there is an urgent need for new and more effective anticonvulsants.", 
    "45": "Midazolam (15 mg), pentobarbitone (100 mg) and a placebo were administered orally to nine male volunteers in double-blind crossover studies and the effect on the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was observed for periods of 6 hours. It was concluded that neither drug caused any significant degree of respiratory depression.", 
    "46": "Most electrically induced seizures involve forebrain structures, such as the amygdala or frontal cortex, but the following studies characterized a specific anatomic site in the inferior colliculus which generated seizure-like behavior after a single, low current electrical stimulation. When a bipolar electrode was implanted into the dorsomedial aspect of the inferior colliculus, low stimulation currents (120 to 200 microA, 30 Hz) produced wild running behavior which outlasted the stimulation by 4 to 10 s. This wild running behavior was directly correlated with local afterdischarge in the inferior colliculus, while no changes were found in the EEG activity in the cortex or hippocampus. Though the threshold current necessary to invoke the wild running seizures remained stable for long periods of time, the presentation of two stimulations a day for 2 weeks caused a progressive increase in the duration of poststimulus wild running. In the last days of the chronic stimulations, some forelimb tonus or myoclonic jerks followed the wild running seizures. These latter behaviors were correlated with local afterdischarges at the electrode tips in the inferior colliculus and spiking EEG activity in the frontal cortex. Pharmacologically, haloperidol, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and ethosuximide proved ineffective in attenuating the seizures, whereas phenytoin, sodium valproate, and chlordiazepoxide attenuated the seizures. These findings are discussed in relation to the genesis of epilepsy in humans.", 
    "47": "Midazolam is a short-acting water-soluble benzodiazepine (at pH less than 4), a member of a new class of imidazobenzodiazepine derivatives. At physiological pH the drug becomes much more lipid soluble. Water solubility minimises pain on injection and venous thrombosis compared with diazepam administered in organic solvent. Midazolam is a hypnotic-sedative drug with anxiolytic and marked amnestic properties. To date it has been used mostly by the intravenous route, for sedation in dentistry and endoscopic procedures and as an adjunct to local anaesthetic techniques. It has proved less reliable than thiopentone, but preferable to diazepam, as an intravenous induction agent and is unlikely to replace the other well established drugs. However, due to the cardiorespiratory stability following its administration, midazolam is useful for anaesthetic induction in poor-risk, elderly and cardiac patients. The short elimination half-life (1.5-3.5h) and the absence of clinically important long acting metabolites make midazolam suitable for long term infusion as a sedative and amnestic for intensive care, but clinical trials have yet to be completed. Thus, a combination of properties make midazolam a useful addition to the benzodiazepine group.", 
    "48": "Clobazam, 20 or 30 mg/day was given for 10 days around menstruation in successive menstrual cycles to 13 women who had responded favourably to this drug in an earlier short-term placebo controlled cross-over study. Three patients have been successfully treated, with complete freedom from seizures around menstruation, for 3-3 1/2 years and two others responded favourably until pregnancy made treatment inappropriate. A further four patients did well during a shorter period (6-13 months) of follow-up. An increase in seizures between periods of clobazam therapy was observed in three patients, and led to the withdrawal of this drug in two of them. However, tolerance to the antiepileptic effect of clobazam was not observed in any patient, even though nine were treated for 1 year or more. In only once case was it necessary to discontinue treatment because of sedative side effects.", 
    "49": "Status epilepticus is a medical emergency that requires rapid seizure control. Intravenous bolus diazepam has been used in the rapid reversal of status epilepticus; this agent usually is combined with parenteral phenobarbital or phenytoin for a more sustained suppression of seizure activity. In certain situations, these longer-acting agents are not effective in controlling the seizure disorder, necessitating alternative therapeutic measures. Continuous diazepam infusion has been used successfully to treat persistent seizure activity. Its use, however, is fraught with pharmaceutical problems. This article reviews the pharmacology, efficacy, and pharmaceutical results of using continuous infusion intravenous diazepam to treat status epilepticus.", 
    "50": "Twenty three patients on class 3 or 4 NYHA were anesthetized with flunitrazepam 30 micrograms/kg. fentanyl 20 micrograms/kg, N2O for coronary bypass surgery. Hemodynamics data before and after induction reveal a 30% fall of cardiac index with stability of systolic vascular resistance. This higher value refer to literature on flunitrazepam. The clinical association with N2O and fentanyl can explain negatively inotropic effect. The bad ventricular function of this patients is probably the cause of a underestimate vascular filling.", 
    "51": "The usefulness of midazolam as an adjunct during high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia was studied by following the changes in the haemodynamics and total body oxygenation after an intravenous injection of 0.075 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam during the induction of fentanyl (75 micrograms/kg)-oxygen anaesthesia for a coronary artery bypass operation. These responses were then compared to the changes seen in patients receiving the same fentanyl anaesthesia without the midazolam. A rapid decline after the midazolam injection was seen in the mean systemic arterial pressure (24-32%--the lowest individual value was 45 mmHg (6.0 kPa)) and in the systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressures (29-33% and 30-31%) in 1-3 min. As measured 10 min after the midazolam injection, a decrease from the baseline was seen in the stroke index (25-30%), in the left ventricular stroke work index (46-42%) and in the right ventricular stroke work index (48-61%). These haemodynamic variables remained on a lower level throughout the study period (40 min) in the midazolam patients as compared to the controls. The tissue oxygenation seemed to be sufficient in all groups during the study period. An intravenous injection of a relatively low dose of midazolam during the induction of high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia seems to be followed by rapidly increased venous pooling and a moderately to severely decreased systemic arterial pressure. Based on the results of this study, midazolam cannot be recommended as an adjunct during high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia.", 
    "52": "The alcohol withdrawal syndromes are generally self-limited processes from which spontaneous recovery can be anticipated. To achieve this outcome, the various types of withdrawal must be managed in such a way as to prevent the occurrence of life-threatening situations. This begins with a good initial evaluation, followed by the appropriate pharmacologic and behavioral steps to control the severity of withdrawal symptoms and to manage complications. Once the withdrawal process is completed, the patient can then be entered into a long-term treatment program.", 
    "53": "Mental stress may directly influence coronary heart disease (CHD) and also a number of its etiologic risk factors. Research work carried out by the Psychopharmacology Research Group in the United Kingdom indicates that antianxiety drugs may have an application in the management of the stress factors influencing CHD. In one study there was a significant reduction in the glyceryl trinitrate requirements of patients treated with a tranquilizer, but this result was not confirmed in two other studies. However, out of a total of 77 patients treated with a placebo, there were five cases of myocardial infarction during the trial periods as compared to no such cases among 81 patients treated with the antianxiety drugs.", 
    "54": "The degranulation of the gastric mastocytes, gastric cAMP levels and intragastric pH were studied in Shay rats after the intraduodenal administration of 20 mg/kg pyrenzepine chlorhydrate. There was a significant increase in the intragastric pH after the administration of this substance, reaching its maximum alkalization 120 min later. The cAMP levels decreased significantly and reached their lowest levels 60 min later. The possible antihistaminic effect of the drug was also studied. Pyrenzepine did not reduce the acid secretion induced by the subcutaneous administration of different doses of histamine. The results show that the decrease in the cAMP gastric levels and in the acid secretion was not due to an antihistaminic effect of pyrenzepine chlorhydrate.", 
    "55": "Ro 5-3663 is a convulsant 1,4-benzodiazepine that does not act at the benzodiazepine, but at the picrotoxin, site. To characterize the behavioural actions of Ro 5-3663, a comparison was made between its effects and those of picrotoxin, when combined with several compounds that act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The quinolines, PK 8165, PK 9084 and CGS 8216 caused myoclonic jerks when combined with subconvulsant doses of Ro 5-3663 or picrotoxin; in combination with picrotoxin they also caused full tonic-clonic convulsions. Ro 15-1788 (1, 10 mg kg-1) caused myoclonic jerks when it was given 10 min before, or at the same time as, subconvulsant doses of either compound. Diazepam (2, 4 mg kg-1) was anticonvulsant against both compounds. However, Ro 15-1788 (10, 20 mg kg-1, 20 min before), PK 8165 (80 mg kg-1) and PK 9084 (60 mg kg-1) were effective only against the convulsions induced by Ro 5-3663. It is not possible to determine whether these differences between Ro 5-3663 and picrotoxin are quantitative or qualitative.", 
    "56": "The therapeutic effect and safety of alprazolam and doxepin were studied in 126 outpatients suffering from primary unipolar depression. The 6-week study was double-blind with a random allocation of treatment. Patients were treated with a flexible dose of 1.0-4.5 mg of alprazolam and 50-225 mg of doxepin per day. The mean final doses were 2.7 mg for alprazolam and 137.5 mg for doxepin. The results indicate that alprazolam and doxepin were equally efficacious. The incidence of side-effects was lower in the alprazolam treatment group."
