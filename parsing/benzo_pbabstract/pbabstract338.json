    "0": "A family with two members who had early-onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA) with retained tendon reflexes had, in addition to their motor deficits, a progressive impairment of cognitive and visuospatial abilities. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-flumazenil to study gamma-aminobutyric type A/benzodiazepine receptor binding (BZR) and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to analyze longitudinally regional cerebral glucose metabolism. Flumazenil-PET demonstrated loss of BZR binding that has not been shown in Friedreich's ataxia and olivopontocerebellar atrophy. These findings may be useful for differentiation of EOCA from other types of cerebellar ataxia. In comparison to age-matched control subjects, these patients showed a global metabolic decline and predominant hypometabolism in the thalamus and cerebellum. The progressive metabolic derangement may be explainable by a disturbed integrity of cognition-related networks resulting from secondary degeneration of cerebello-thalamo-cortical projections.", 
    "1": "Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a clinically defined syndrome of leg tremor while standing. Controversy surrounds whether OT is a distinct syndrome or is an essential tremor (ET) variant. We report two patients with OT. Electrophysiological testing included polymyography, accelerometry, nerve conduction, and evoked potential studies. The effects of various maneuvers and body positions on the tremor were assessed. The findings included rapid (15-17 Hz) lower-extremity tremor burst frequency evoked by standing but not by walking or swaying; rapid upper-extremity burst pattern synchronous with lower-extremity bursts; and failure of electrical stimulation or mental concentration to \"reset\" the tremor. Additionally, there was the novel finding of accelerometric recordings in the legs revealing the same rapid frequency (16-17 Hz) as the electromyographic tremor bursts. Some prior reports have suggested that OT is related to ET by emphasizing a considerable disparity and variability between the accelerometric tremor frequency and the electromyographic burst frequency. In our patients, however, the rapid (15-17 Hz) accelerometer-recorded tremor synchronous with the electromyographic bursts, and also the clinical improvement with clonazepam but not beta blockers or mysoline, and the lack of a family history of ET provide support that OT is distinct from ET.", 
    "2": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms of hyperammonaemia include alterations of mood and personality, cognitive impairment, ataxia, convulsions and coma. The nature and severity of CNS dysfunction depend upon the aetiology and degree of hyperammonaemia, its acuteness of onset and the age of the patient. Neuropathological studies reveal Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the adult hyperammonaemic patient, whereas hyperammonaemia in the infant resulting from congenital urea cycle disorders or Reye syndrome is accompanied by cerebral atrophy, neuronal loss and cerebral oedema. Several electrophysiological and biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the deleterious effects of ammonia on CNS function. Such mechanisms include direct effects of the ammonium ion on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission and a deficit in cerebral energy metabolism due to ammonia-induced inhibition of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. In addition, ammonia has been shown to interfere with normal processes of uptake, storage and release of various neurotransmitters. Ammonia disrupts monoamine storage, inhibits the high-affinity uptake of glutamate by both astrocytic and neuronal elements and activates 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors leading to the potential synthesis of neuroactive steroids in brain. On the basis of these actions, it has been proposed that ammonia disrupts neuron-astrocyte trafficking of amino acids and monoamines in brain. The increased formation of brain glutamine in hyperammonaemic syndromes could be responsible for the phenomenon of brain oedema in these disorders. Therapies aimed at either decreasing ammonia production in the gastrointestinal tract or increasing ammonia removal by liver or skeletal muscle are the mainstay in the prevention and treatment of the CNS consequences of hyperammonaemia. New therapeutic approaches aimed at correction of the neurotransmitter and cerebral energy deficits in these syndromes could hold promise for the future.", 
    "3": "Block copolymers consisting of poly(gamma-benzyl L-glutamate) (PBLG) as the hydrophobic block and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the hydrophilic block were synthesized and characterized. Core-shell type nanoparticles of the block copolymers (abbreviated as GE) were prepared by the diafiltration method. The particle size diameter obtained by dynamic light scattering of GE-1 (PBLG content: 60.5 mol%), GE-2 (PBLG content: 40.0 mol %), GE-3 (PBLG content: 124.4 mol %) copolymer was 309.9 +/- 160.9, 251.9 +/- 220.6 and 200.5 +/- 177.1nm, respectively. The shape of the nanoparticles by SEM or TEM was almost spherical. The critical micelle concentration of the block copolymers obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy was dependent on the chain length of hydrophobic PBLG. The micelle structure of the copolymers nanoparticle was very stable against sodium dodecyl sulfate. Clonazepam (CZ) was loaded onto the core part of the nanoparticle as the crystalline state. Release of CZ from the nanoparticles in vitro was dependent on the drug loading contents and PBLG chain length.", 
    "4": "A 68-year-old woman was found unconscious and hardly breathing. Artificial ventilation was undertaken by an emergency physician who brought her to hospital. Physical examination provided no evidence of relevant organ abnormalities. Neurological examination of the comatose patient revealed absent brain-stem reflexes and spontaneous respiration. But no other focal neurological abnormalities were found.", 
    "5": "Routine laboratory tests, ECG, chest radiogram, Doppler sonography of arteries to the brain, lumbar cerebrospinal fluid and computed tomography of the skull were unremarkable. Toxicological tests discovered bromazepam intoxication (serum level 6 mg/l; maximal serum level after intake of 6 mg of the active constituent: 0.1 mg/dl).", 
    "6": "When bromazepam poisoning was demonstrated elimination of the drug was no longer feasible; the spontaneous course of the poisoning with slowly falling drug levels could thus be observed over 10 days. In parallel with the fall of bromazepam concentration in blood, restitution of breathing and of brain-stem reflexes was recorded until, 12 days after intake of the drug, normal functions had been restored.", 
    "7": "Central respiratory arrest occurred at a bromazepam serum level of 6 mg/l. Without intensive medical care the patient would not have survived.", 
    "8": "Local application of GABA to rat cerebral cortical neurons in brain slices elicited biphasic responses mediated via GABAA receptors. The fast component of the response, which was most apparent with somatic application of GABA, was hyperpolarizing at the normal resting membrane potential (GABAh response). The slower component could be elicited by GABA application to nearly all regions of the cell, and was depolarizing at the resting membrane potential (GABAd response). The reversal potential of evoked IPSCs recorded with whole-cell patch electrodes (-68 mV) was comparable to the reversal potential of the GABAh response (-69 mV), and was significantly different from the reversal potential of the GABAd response (-56 mV). The GABAd response was more sensitive to enhancement by pentobarbital and more readily antagonized by both bicuculline and picrotoxin than the GABAh response. Recording in bicarbonate-free buffer changed the reversal potential of the GABAd response significantly, but had no effect on the GABAh response. In contrast, superfusion with ethanol significantly enhanced the GABAh response, while having no effect on the GABAd component. Although a localized collapse of the Cl- gradient, which has been proposed to underlie the GABAd response, could explain the greater sensitivity of the GABAd response to pentobarbital and the GABAA antagonists, this could not account for the greater sensitivity of the GABAh response to ethanol. Differences in GABAA receptor subunit composition may result in the expression of dendritic and somatic GABAA receptors that have different kinetics, reversal potentials, and sensitivity to pharmacological agents, including ethanol.", 
    "9": "For the evaluation of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission during seizures, rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas were separately assessed by brain microdialysis, and extracelluar glutamate and GABA were measured through the course of the seizures after a systemic administration of kainic acid (KA). The generalized convulsion started at about 1.5 h and was suppressed by diazepam at 2 h after the KA treatment. In the CA3 area, extracellular glutamate started to increase soon after the KA injection and returned to the control level at about 1.5 h. A decrease and then slight increase of the extracellular glutamate level in CA3 followed the diazepam injection. In the CA1 area, in contrast, a long-lasting decrease of extracellular glutamate was observed. The extracellular GABA concentration in the CA3 area increased immediately after the systemic administration of KA and returned to the normal level at about 3.5 h. A second increase in the extracellular GABA in this area began at about 4.5 h after the KA treatment. In the CA1 area, an increase of extracellular GABA began at about 3.5 h after KA administration (much later than that observed in the CA3 area) and was maintained throughout the observation. In situ hybridization showed a transient expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-67 mRNA in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus at 4 and 6 h, whereas GAD65 mRNA was unaffected. GABA immunoreactivity in the same area and mossy fibers in the CA3 were increased most significantly at 8 h after administration of KA. The possible relation of GABA induction in mossy fibers with the delayed increase in extracellular GABA in CA3 was discussed.", 
    "10": "Animal conflict models have been used for years as a preclinical screen for predicting anxiolytic therapeutic efficacy. Anxiolytics, including benzodiazepines, increase punished responding. This suggests that the punished behavior may be mediated by the GABA receptor. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed in situ hybridization histochemistry studies of GABA receptor subunits (alpha1-alpha4) and synthetic enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) in four groups of rats: conflict (punishment), yoked controls (rats shocked without conflict training history), fixed interval only controls (rats that worked for food but were not shocked) and untreated controls. With conflict behavioral training, bilateral reduction of mRNA for the GABAA alpha1 subunit was seen relative to controls in the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus. In contrast, alteration of alpha2 mRNA levels appeared only in the yoked control group, with increased levels seen in the thalamus and cortex and decreased levels in the hippocampus. There were no differences in the alpha2 mRNA level between the control and the conflict behavioral trained animals. Further, no significant differences were found between groups in the mRNA levels for the alpha3 subunit, alpha4 subunit, GAD65, and GAD67. These results suggest that the behaviors related to conflict and uncontrollable aversive stimuli (yoked control group) are accompanied and perhaps mediated by selective changes in the GABAA alpha1 or alpha2 subunits, respectively. These findings highlight the potential usefulness of the conflict model as a means of elucidating the biological underpinnings of anxiety disorder. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

    "11": "The effects of spermine on the acquisition and retention of spatial learning in the Morris water maze were studied. Spermine 25 and 125 nmol i.c.v. did not alter the ability of rats to find a hidden platform in the water maze when administered before training over 5 days. However, the inhibitory effect of the benzodiazepine, diazepam (3 mg/kg i.p., 30 min prior to training), on path length to target was markedly potentiated by the higher dose of spermine, consistent with spermine acting as a functional antagonist at the NMDA receptor. This drug combination did not affect performance on visible platform trials. Administration of doses of 125 and 250 nmol (but not 62.5 nmol) of spermine i.c.v. in the week prior to training (daily for 5 days) dose-dependently inhibited subsequent learning of a platform position in the absence of drug. These higher doses of spermine produced neuronal loss and increased [3H]PK11195 binding indicating microglial activation predominantly in the hippocampus and to a lesser extent in the striatum, septum, thalamus and amygdala. Spermine 125 nmol i.c.v. (daily for 7 days) also abolished retention of a previously learned platform position when administered in an interval between training and retention testing. The inhibitory effects of spermine 125 nmol i.c.v. (daily for 7 days) on subsequent spatial learning were not antagonised by concomitant administration of 30 nmol dizocilpine. These results demonstrate that spermine produces a delayed neurotoxic effect in particular neuronal populations in the brain that selectively impair spatial learning and recall.", 
    "12": "To investigate the ability of hexanic ethanolic fraction of Rubus brasiliensis Martius (Roseceae), to induce anxiolytic effect and also the possible involvement of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, male Wistar rats and Swiss mice behaviour were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM). All the doses of the extract, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg, administered per gavage (vo), 30 min before the behavioural evaluation, induced an anxiolytic effect expressed by: increased number of entries in and time spent in the open arms and percentage of open arm entries; and decreased number of entries and time spent in the closed arms. The treatment of mice with flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, i.p., 15-min before the administration of hexanic fraction, 100 mg/kg, vo, blocked the hexanic fraction-induced anxiolytic effect. The LD50 for the hexanic fraction was 1512 mg/kg. In conclusion, it was shown that the hexanic fraction of R. brasiliensis induced an anxiolytic effect in rats and mice. This effect can be attributed to a liposoluble principle with low toxicity which may be acting as an agonist on GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "13": "The aim of the present work was to investigate if infuse and ethanolic extracts (aqueous, butanolic and wax fractions) of Rubus brasiliensis Martius (Rosaceae) induce anxiolytic effect. The extracts were administered to male Wistar rats and Swiss mice per oral route, at 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg, 30 min before the behavioral evaluation in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Both infuse and wax ethanolic fraction at the dosage 150 mg/kg, vo, increased the number and the percentage of open arm entries of rats and mice. The aqueous and butanolic fractions, obtained from ethanolic extract, failed to induce anxiolytic effect. The treatment of mice with flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p., 15-min before the administration of infuse or wax fraction, 150 mg/kg, vo, blocked the infuse or wax fraction-induced anxiolytic effect. The LD50 for the wax fraction was 1000 mg/kg. In conclusion, the infuse and wax ethanolic fraction of R. brasiliensis present anxiolytic effect in rats and mice. In addition, it is suggested that the anxiolytic effect may be attributed at least to one liposoluble principle with low acute toxicity which may be acting as an agonist on GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "14": "The effects of treatment with anxiogenic or anxiolytic agents and exposure to acute restraint stress on emotional behavior in mice were examined using an automatic hole-board apparatus. Changes in the emotional state of mice were evaluated in terms of changes in exploratory activity, i.e., total locomotor activity, numbers and duration of rearing and head-dipping, and latency to the first head-dipping. The typical benzodiazepine anxiolytics diazepam (0.05-0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and chlordiazepoxide (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased the number and duration of head-dips at doses that did not produce sedation. In contrast with these anxiolytics, the typical anxiogenic drugs N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG7142, 0.125-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM, 0.1-2 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased both the number and duration of head-dips, and increased the latency to head-dipping. Moreover, decreases in the number and duration of head-dips, and an increase in the latency to head-dipping, were also observed in animals that were exposed to acute restraint stress. These effects of acute restraint stress were suppressed by treatment with diazepam at a dose that alone did not produce significant behavioral effects (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). In addition, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic flesinoxan (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, also had an effect on the restraint stress-induced decrease in head-dipping behavior. The present study shows that the changes in several exploratory behaviors could be objectively measured using our automatic hole-board apparatus. Therefore, this system can serve as a useful tool for evaluating the changes in various emotional states of animals. Moreover, we also found that treatment with anxiolytics or anxiogenics and exposure to acute restraint stress affected head-dipping behavior. These results suggest that changes in head-dipping behavior in the hole-board test may reflect the anxiogenic and/or anxiolytic state of animals.", 
    "15": "This study examined the effect of the benzodiazepine, midazolam, on the consumption and palatability of 6% ethanol in male Wistar rats. In the first experiment, it was found that midazolam (5 mg/kg) increased home cage ethanol drinking 0-2 h after administration. Another intake experiment, in which ethanol was infused directly into the oral cavity through an indwelling catheter, also showed that midazolam (10 mg/kg) stimulated alcohol ingestion. The affective response to intraoral infusions of ethanol (1 ml during 1 min) was subsequently monitored in benzodiazepine-treated rats. Taste reactivity testing showed that midazolam (5-10 mg/kg) significantly increased the occurrence of hedonic orofacial responses and suppressed the number of passive drippings. A similar response pattern was observed following administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), but not after exposure to cis(Z)flupentixol (10 mg/kg). Midazolam also increased the incidence of hedonic responses in alcohol-naive rats with no previous access to ethanol in the home cages. Hedonic responsiveness did not appear to diminish with repeated benzodiazepine exposure: the behaviour of rats given five midazolam injections (10 mg/kg every second day) was similar to that shown by rats with no benzodiazepine pre-exposure. The increased hedonic response to ethanol induced by midazolam was blocked by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg), the latter drug exerting no effects on its own. The present results suggest that benzodiazepines, by acting on GABA(A) receptors, may facilitate ethanol intake by increasing ethanol's taste hedonic properties.", 
    "16": "Clonazepam, which is a benzodiazepine structurally related to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, diazepam and nitrazepam, has been available for the treatment of seizure disorders in the USA since 1976 and in Japan since 1981. Increasingly, clonazepam has been used in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. Six representative case studies are presented and specific guidelines for the use of clonazepam are discussed.", 
    "17": "By using otoacoustic emission, we looked for change in outer hair cell (OHC) motile activity and medial olivocochlear (MOC) system inhibition due to benzodiazepine administration, a drug that is known to produce a pharmacological effect by interacting with GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. No effect was observed on OHC motile activity, in contrast benzodiazepines decreased MOC system effectiveness suggesting the existence of GABAergic fibers projecting onto the MOC system.", 
    "18": "Previous studies evaluated the prudent use and potential over use of drug screens in clinical decision making. However, the percentage of emergency physicians who can correctly identify which drugs are found on their hospital's basic drug screens has not been established. Results of physician closed-ended questionnaires were compared to the results of a telephone survey with each physician's individual hospital laboratory. Eighty-one (35.7%) of 227 emergency physicians responded. Four (4.9%) correctly identified what was on their individual institution's urine drug screens and 17 (21%) correctly identified what was on serum screens. In other results, 74.3% erroneously relayed that all benzodiazepines can be found on urine drug screens and 46.3% incorrectly answered that acetaminophen would be found on basic quantitative serum screens. Drug screen results can be misinterpreted if the drugs the physician expects to be screened for, and what is actually screened for, are not the same. Pharmacy and laboratory personnel have a responsibility to keep the physician informed of drug screen issues. They should be proactive in advising physicians of changes in drug testing and new drug screening methods or by providing reports on the occurrence of false positive results.", 
    "19": "1. On going work in our laboratory has shown that adenosine modulates ethanol-induced motor incoordination (EIMI) when given systemically as well as directly into the cerebral ventricles, cerebellum and corpus striatum of the rat and/or mouse. 2. The objective of this study was to determine what effect adenosine agonists and antagonists would have within the rat motor cortex on EIMI. 3. The participation of the motor cortex in EIMI was suggested when microinfusion of the anti-ethanol compound, Ro15-4513, an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine binding site, directly into the motor cortex significantly attenuated EIMI. Further, the adenosine agonists N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)-phenethylamino-5'-N-carboxaminoadenosine++ + hydrochloride (CGS-21680) significantly accentuated EIMI in a dose-related manner. The adenosine A1 receptor-selective agonist, CHA, appeared most potent in this modulatory effect when compared to the A2-selective agonist, CGS-21680. 4. The extent of diffusion of the adenosine drugs within the cortical tissue after their microinfusion was also checked by measuring the dispersion of microinfused [3H]CHA. The [3H]CHA dispersion study indirectly confirmed that the results of the present investigation were based on the effect of adenosine drugs within the motor cortex only. 5. Accentuation by the A1- and A2-selective adenosine agonists was significantly attenuated by the A1-selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) but not by the A2 receptor-selective antagonist 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC) further suggesting modulation mainly by the A1-subtype. 6. Pretreatment of the motor cortex with pertussis toxin (PT) significantly reduced the capacity of both A1- and A2-selective adenosine agonists to accentuate EIMI suggesting the involvement of a PT-sensitive Gi/Go protein. 7. These data support earlier work which showed that adenosine modulates EIMI within the central nervous system (CNS), most likely via the A1 receptor, and moreover, extend that work by including the motor cortex as a brain area participating in the adenosinergic modulation of ethanol-induced motor impairment.", 
    "20": "Changes in the reactivating efficiency of blockade of components of the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex were analyzed in conditions of preliminary activation and inhibition of dopamine autoreceptors using (+)ZRRR and haloperidol respectively. A conditioned passive escape reflex was used, along with amnesia produced by detaining mice in the danger sector of a chamber immediately after imposition of a painful stimulus. Doses of bicuculline (1 mg/kg), picrotoxin (1 mg/kg), and flumazenil (10 mg/kg) given before testing restored performance of the conditioned response without altering the neurochemical background. Reductions and increases in dopaminergic activity during the training period prevented restoration of the conditioned passive escape response by blockade of GABAa and benzodiazepine receptors and chloride channels. It is suggested that the neurochemical mechanisms involved in restoring the damaged memory trace are based on the formation of te optimal balance in the activities of the various components of the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex and the dopaminergic system.", 
    "21": "A reversed-phase HPLC method was developed for the kinetic investigation of the acidic hydrolysis of prazepam which was carried out in hydrochloric acid solutions of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 M. In addition, a fourth-order derivative method for monitoring the parent compound itself was proposed and evaluated. One intermediate was observed by HPLC, which should be formed from breakage of the azomethine linkage. Further slow hydrolysis of the amide bond led to the benzophenone product that was isolated and identified. The mechanism of hydrolysis was biphasic, showing a consecutive reaction with a reversible step. Relative standard deviation was less than 2% for HPLC and less than 5% for the derivative method. Detection limits were 1.2 x 10(-7) M for the former method and 6.7 x 10(-7)M for the latter. Accelerated studies at higher temperatures were employed. Results of HPLC and fourth-order derivative methods were statistically the same.", 
    "22": "A sensitive and specific method based in solid-phase extraction and reverse-phase liquid chromatography was developed and validated for the quantitation of L-768673 in a microemulsion formulation. Following a water wash, the drug was eluted from the extraction column with acetonitrile and was analyzed on a reverse-phase C18 column with UV detection at 245 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% triethylamine (53:47 v/v). The retention time L-768673 was approximately 28 min with a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1.", 
    "23": "The effects of flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist and those of NNC-711, a GABA transporter blocker, on the in vivo binding of [3H]N-methylspiperone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, were investigated in mouse brain. Treatment with either flunitrazepam or NNC-711 reduced the specific binding of [3H]N-methylspiperone in the striatum. Flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, blocked the effect of flunitrazepam, indicating that the reduction in specific binding in the striatum was mediated via the GABAergic system. The flunitrazepam significantly decreased the specific binding of [3H]N-methylspiperone in the striatum at all time points studied after tracer injection, whereas specific binding in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex was unaltered. This decrease in specific binding in the striatum was found to be due to a reduced input rate constant (k3) of [3H]N-methylspiperone. The maximum number of the binding sites available for dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum was not changed by the flunitrazepam treatment.", 
    "24": "Flunitrazepam's (FNZ) effect on sleep and memory 1 mg and 2 mg was investigated in 6 healthy volunteers (mean age 21.5 +/- 0.8 years) by polysomnography (PSG) and memory testing. A PSG was recorded on each study night. Memory testing was done before sleep (40 min after taking FNZ or placebo), and after waking (560 min after medication). Rapid eye movement (REM) latency was found to be prolonged on the FNZ 2 mg night (FNZ2N) compared to the baseline night (BN). Percentage of stage 2 sleep was increased in the FNZ2N as compared to BN, while REM percentage on both FNZ nights did not significantly differ from BN. The number of total REM and REM density were decreased in the FNZ2N compared to BN. Memory testing showed significant differences between before sleep and after waking on the FNZ2N. There was a significant correlation between the degree of impairment on memory testing and the rate of reduced REM density, but there was no significant correlation between degree of impairment on memory testing and the rate of increased non-REM sleep on the FNZ2N. The results of this study suggest that impairments in memory result from the dose of FNZ, and that there is a possibility of a relationship between memory disturbance and REM sleep suppression caused by this benzodiazepine.", 
    "25": "With the increased use of intraoperative monitoring of the central nervous system (CNS) has come a need for better understanding of the effects of anesthetic agents on intraoperative recordings. The commonly used anesthetic agents and their effects on intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (EP) are discussed. Halogenated inhalational anesthetics produce dose-related reduction in EEG amplitude and frequency after an initial activation. They also produce dose-related decreases in amplitude and increases in latency of sensory evoked potentials (SEP) that are most marked in cortically generated components. Subcortical, spinal, and peripheral evoked responses are less affected. Responses in the motor pathways are recordable in the epidural space; however, the relative contributions of sensory and motor tracts may be changed when both are present. Muscle responses are easily suppressed after spinal and motor cortex stimulation, probably by anesthetic effect at the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Intravenous analgesic agents (opioids, ketamine) are associated with less marked changes in EEG and evoked responses, with some increases in amplitude of cortically generated SEP caused by ketamine. Intravenous sedative-hypnotic drugs (droperidol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, etomidate, propofol) produce dose-related depression of the EEG after initial activation and dose-related depression of evoked responses to a lesser extent than do the inhalation agents. Etomidate is associated with amplitude enhancement of EEG and cortically generated SEP. Muscle relaxants have minimal effect on the EEG and SEP. Their use, however, may alter muscle recordings from motor tract stimulation. These effects and their relevance to the choice of agents for specific monitoring techniques are discussed.", 
    "26": "We investigated the effect of chronically blocking NMDA receptor stimulation to examine changes in GABA(A) receptor expression and pharmacology in cerebellar granule cells at different stages of maturation. We have previously shown that NMDA-selective glutamate receptor stimulation alters GABA(A) receptor pharmacology in cerebellar granule neurons in vitro by altering the levels of selective subunits. When NMDA receptor stimulation is blocked with MK-801 during the first week in vitro, a decrease in the alpha1, gamma2S, and gamma2L receptor subunit mRNAs occurred. When present only during the second week, changes were limited to the alpha1 and gamma2L mRNAs. Finally, if MK-801 was present during the first week and removed during the second week, these changes reversed. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings showed that treatment with MK-801 during either the first or second week increased the EC50 of the receptors for GABA and attenuated the potentiation mediated by flunitrazepam. Last, these properties were reversed if MK-801 was removed after the first week in vitro. Our results suggest that MK-801 reversibly inhibits GABA(A) receptor maturation by modulating receptor subunit expression and that the altered pharmacological responses appear to be dominated by changes in the levels of allosteric modulation mediated by the gamma2 receptor subunit.", 
    "27": "The CEDIA dau Benzodiazepine assay has been reformulated to include online hydrolysis of urinary benzodiazepine glucuronide conjugates. The new antibody possesses enhanced cross-reactivities toward the low-dose benzodiazepines, which are excreted at low urinary drug-metabolite concentrations. The screening method was evaluated using lorazepam as the probe benzodiazepine. Four subjects each consumed a 1-mg lorazepam tablet. Sequential urine voids over the same time intervals were collected for the next 48 h. Twelve postdose urine samples were collected from each subject. Positive results were obtained from 5-24 h to 2-35 h using a 200-ng/mL nitrazepam calibration cutoff. There was no practical difference between hydrolyzing online with the supplied E. coli beta-glucuronidase or offline with Helix pomatia beta-glucuronidase purchased separately. Without hydrolysis, all urine samples tested negative. The cross-reactivities of lorazepam in terms of nitrazepam calibration equivalents, varied from 108 to 178% for lorazepam concentrations between 50 and 2500 ng/mL. Lorazepam glucuronide gave cross-reactivities (expressed as lorazepam base) between 72 and 136% using the online hydrolysis procedure with E. coli beta-glucuronidase. Offline hydrolysis with Helix pomatia gave cross-reactivities between 84 and 134%. Without hydrolysis, lorazepam glucuronide gave less than 4% cross-reactivity in the assay.",

    "29": "A two stage trial was completed: an initial prospective, double blinded, randomised trial comparing 0.2 mg/kg midazolam suspension with 0.5 mg/kg, followed by further data collection on the higher dose. Children whom staff and parents felt required sedation for accurate and humane completion of minor procedures were selected. Anxiety was measured using physiological parameters, a behavioural anxiety score, a parental visual analogue scale, and a telephone questionnaire at 2-7 days after the procedure.", 
    "30": "Fifty patients in total were recruited. Randomisation between two doses ceased after 20 patients since staff, despite being \"blinded\", perceived there to be a wide variation in response to midazolam and attributed that to the difference in doses. On breaking the code these suspicions were partly supported. Due to reluctance to continue with the lower dose all children subsequently received 0.5 mg/kg. At this higher dose oral midazolam had an onset of action of 15 minutes and was effective in 76% of children (as measured by anxiety score and/or subsequent amnesia). Amnesia was reported in 66% of children. There were no adverse side effects except paradoxical hyperagitation in three (6%); this did not require any specific treatment.

Calls were initially taken on a local Winnipeg line, although in 1987 a toll-free number was made available to rural Manitoba residents.", 
    "39": "The majority of the calls received by MILE were from women aged 65 years or older who accessed MILE on their own initiative. Ninety-one percent of the calls were rated as not serious. Only 6% of calls were from outside Winnipeg. Although 94% of the older consumers reported having a regular pharmacist, they commonly never thought of using their pharmacist for inquiries. The drugs cited most often by consumers, nurses, physicians, and dentists were the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, cardiac drugs, diuretics, antihypertensives, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants. The type of inquiries most frequently involved adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, and therapeutic use. The drugs cited and inquiries made by pharmacist callers were more diverse than those of consumers and other healthcare professionals.",

    "41": "We have developed a micro-extraction procedure for the analysis of chlordiazepoxide and its two unique metabolites, demoxepam and desmethylchlordiazepoxide, in plasma, using liquid chromatography. The method is both reliable and sensitive for the quantitation of low plasma concentrations of these three compounds. The extraction procedure allows rapid sample processing, which, together with the small sample volume (100 microL), makes it ideal for routine sample handling. The limit of detection for the three compounds ranged from 0.075 to 0.125 mg/L and recovery of the three different benzodiazepines ranged from 87 to 94%. Within- and between-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 3.1-4.5% and from 4.7 to 7.6%, respectively.", 
    "42": "In order to study the roles of the AMPA and kainate subtypes of non-NMDA glutamate receptors in the processing of persistent nociceptive information, compounds with varying activities at these receptors were examined for effects on the formalin-induced paw-licking behavior in rats. The selective AMPA antagonist, LY300164 and the mixed AMPA/kainate antagonist, NBQX, were compared for their effects on formalin-induced pain behavior. NBQX (3, 10, 20 mg/kg, i.p.), caused antinociception as well as ataxia whereas the selective AMPA antagonist, LY300164 (3,5,10 mg/kg, i.p.), did not cause antinociception at doses that did not produce ataxia. In view of the well documented distribution of kainate receptors on C fibres and of the kainate-preferring iGluR5 subtype on dorsal root ganglia (DRG), we tested a series of three decahydroisoquinolines with different profiles of activity between iGluR5 and AMPA receptors and all without activity on iGluR6, iGluR7 or KA2 subtypes. LY293558 (0.1, 1, 3, 5 mg/kg, i.p.), which had low micromolar affinity for both iGluR5 and 2 caused, like NBQX, both antinociceptive and ataxic effects. However, the selective iGluR5 antagonist LY382884 (5, 10, 30, 100 mg/kg, i.p.), exhibited antinociceptive actions without ataxia while the iGluR2 preferring antagonist LY302679 (5 mg/kg, i.p), caused ataxia but did not produce antinociceptive effects at that dose. These actions were stereoselective since the enantiomeric compounds, LY293559 and LY302680, were ineffective in these tests. The data strongly suggest an involvement of iGluR5 in the processing of nociceptive information.", 
    "43": "Previous studies have shown that the opiate antagonist naloxone blocks the anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines in several models of anxiety, including the elevated plus-maze. Although naloxone preferentially binds to the mu opioid receptor, its selectivity is rather low. The opioid receptor subtype important for anxiolytic-like actions of benzodiazepines in the plus-maze remains, therefore, unknown. In the present experiments, the ability of antagonists selective for subtypes of the opioid receptor to block the anxiolytic-like effects of chlordiazepoxide in the elevated plus-maze was evaluated in Swiss mice. Chlordiazepoxide, 5 mg/kg, increased the proportion as well as the number of open arms entries without modifying closed arms entries. Lower doses of the benzodiazepine were ineffective. The mu receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine, 10 and 20 mg/kg, the delta antagonist naltrindole, 10 mg/kg, and the kappa antagonist nor-binaltorphimine, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, were then combined with chlordiazepoxide, 5 mg/kg. beta-funaltrexamine, 10 mg/kg, reduced the effects of the benzodiazepine while the dose of 20 mg/kg completely blocked the effects. Nor-binaltorphimine was ineffective at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg, but completely inhibited the actions of chlordiazepoxide when the dose was 5 mg/kg. Naltrindole was ineffective. None of the antagonists affected plus-maze behavior when administered alone. It was concluded that the mu and kappa receptors are important for the anxiolytic-like actions of chlordiazepoxide in the elevated plus maze.", 
    "44": "Kainic acid (KA) causes seizures and extensive brain damage in rats. To study the effects of KA on the redox state in cerebral cortex extracellular fluid (ECF), ascorbic and uric acid concentrations were measured in intracerebral microdialysis samples before and after systemic KA administration (ip). During seizures, concentrations of ascorbic and uric acid increased 500 and 100%, respectively. When midazolam was given with KA to prevent seizures, ascorbic acid still increased 400%, but uric acid increased only transiently. When the NMDA receptor antagonist aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV) was included in the microdialysis perfusion media, ascorbic acid levels decreased during baseline perfusion in a concentration-dependent manner. APV then suppressed the KA-induced increase in ascorbic acid levels, without blocking seizure activity. In summary, increased uric acid levels in brain ECF activity after KA administration are related to the induced seizure, but ascorbic acid levels are associated with NMDA receptor activity.", 
    "45": "We conducted a meta-analysis to update the knowledge of long-term efficacy of different treatments in panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Included were 68 studies pertaining to 106 treatment conditions and 1346 patients. Effect sizes Cohen's d were calculated within the treatment conditions at posttest and at follow-up for panic and agoraphobia. A comparison was made between six treatments: high-potency benzodiazepines, antidepressants, psychological panic management, exposure in vivo, antidepressants combined with exposure, and psychological panic management combined with exposure in vivo. The mean (+/- SD) duration of the follow-up period was 62 +/- 89 weeks. In the majority of the studies (84%), follow-up had a naturalistic character. The lack of information about treatments received between posttest and follow-up limits the interpretation of the results. For all conditions, the treatment gains at posttest were maintained during the follow-up period. The mean (+/- SD) d for panic was 1.11 +/- 0.70 at posttest and 1.28 +/- 0.61 at follow-up; for agoraphobia, the mean d at posttest was 1.36 +/- 1.10 and at follow-up it was 1.41 +/- 0.82. Significant differences were found in efficacy on agoraphobic measures at follow-up between the combination of antidepressants and exposure in vivo versus psychological panic management, exposure in vivo, and the combination of psychological panic management and exposure. Overall, the data suggest that different treatment options for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia are effective at both posttest and follow-up. Research on long-term treatment, discontinuation of therapies, and interventions between posttest and follow-up need more attention, for pharmacotherapy as well as psychotherapy.", 
    "46": "To investigate the behavioral consequences of benzodiazepines in subjects whose septo-hippocampal cholinergic (ACh) activity was impaired, C57BL/6 mice received an injection of 2.5 microg/0.2 microl of scopolamine into the medial septal area with an i.p. injection of 0.5 mg/kg of diazepam. The consequences of these treatments administered in combination or alone were evaluated on anxiety measured in an elevated plus-maze and on spontaneous alternation carried out in a T-maze, using two different intertrial intervals (ITI: 5s or 30s). In these conditions, only the combined treatment provoked a decrease of the anxiety level, which was associated with an impairment of spontaneous alternation restricted to the 5s ITI. Because mice were not impaired during the sequential 30s ITI, this seems to rule out the possibility that this alternation deficit resulted from a working memory loss. These results suggest an involvement of a septal ACh-GABA-A/BDZ interaction in the exaggeration of cognitive deficits produced by benzodiazepines in patients characterized by a cholinergic hypofunction.", 
    "47": "The effects of clonidine, an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, on extracellular concentrations of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the nucleus accumbens of rats were studied by using in vivo brain microdialysis. Clonidine (5 microg/kg i.v.) significantly decreased the brain microdialysate concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens up to a maximum of 16% at its peak effect. This effect was inhibited by a dose of idazoxan (10 microg/kg i.v.), an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist. which itself did not affect the efflux of dopamine. A smaller dose of clonidine (1 microg/kg i.v.), which had no significant effect on dopamine efflux per se, decreased the dopamine efflux (21% reduction) when given together with an ineffective dose of midazolam (0.075 mg/kg i.v.), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist. The effect of clonidine (5 microg/kg i.v.) on mesolimbic dopamine efflux was abolished by bicuculline (1 mg/kg i.v.), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, counteracted by beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester (beta-CCE, 3 mg/kg i.p.), a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, but not affected by flumazenil (6 microg/kg i.v.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Clonidine (5 microg/kg i.v.) increased the dialysate concentration of GABA in the nucleus accumbens up to a maximum of 250% at its peak effect, but not in the ventral tegmental area. It is hypothesized that GABA(A) binding sites in the nucleus accumbens form part of the sequence of events that is triggered by clonidine in an alpha2-adrenergic-specific manner and that ultimately results in a decreased release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.", 
    "48": "The effect of the known anxiolytic agents diazepam and alprazolam and a putative anxiogenic agent, FG 7142, were assessed in a fully automated and computer-integrated two-compartment light/dark apparatus. In addition, psychostimulant drugs (amphetamine, adrafinil, amineptine, and caffeine) were tested to determinate the influence of increasing locomotor activity on the indices of anxiety. Some modifications, such as using a soiled apparatus, have been made from the initial model to reduce any neophobic response to the test situation. These results have been compared to results obtained after cleaning between trials. In addition, strain differences have been assessed by comparing the effect of Swiss mice with the C57Bl/6J strain. The role of each parameter as an index of anxiety is discussed. The time spent in the lit area and exploratory behaviors seemed to be the most reliable parameter for assessing anxiolytic-like activity. Diazepam and alprazolam were found to have an anxiolytic profile. FG 7142 did not demonstrate any intrinsic effect. Amphetamine was reported to be anxiogenic, and amineptine, adrafinil, and caffeine only had a psychostimulant profile. We conclude that the light/dark test may be useful for identifying putative anxiolytic and anxiogenic agents, but an additional test such as an open field or an actimeter test must be performed as a control with regard to the problem of sedation and change in exploration. The Swiss strain of mice has been found a suitable strain to be used in the test.", 
    "49": "Rodents prenatally exposed to ethanol demonstrate altered behavioral and hormonal responses to stressful environments. Prenatal ethanol exposure may also have long-term effects on the offspring's GABAergic system. Using the elevated plus-maze, the present study examined the sensitivity of adult Sprague-Dawley rat offspring from prenatal ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF) and ad lib-fed control (C) conditions to the effects of benzodiazepine (BZD) on plus-maze behavior and corticosterone (CORT) responses. At 60-90 days of age, E, PF, and C males and females were injected subcutaneously with either BZD or saline. Twenty minutes later animals were placed in an open field (OF) for a 5-min test and then on the plus-maze for a 5 min test; behaviors were recorded during testing and blood samples collected at the end of testing for CORT determinations. Overall, sex differences were observed in both OF and plus-maze behaviors. Females showed more ambulation and rearing in the OF than males, and exhibited increased exploratory behaviors and decreased fear-related behaviors compared to males on the plus-maze. Following BZD treatment, both males and females exhibited increased time on open arms, increased open arm entries, and decreased time on closed arms compared to saline-treated males and females, regardless of prenatal treatment. These differences did not appear to be due to altered activity levels, as BZD treatment had no effect on total ambulation in the OF. Importantly, although no significant differences in plus-maze behaviors were found among saline-injected E, PF, and C males or females. BZD treatment differentially affected E males and females compared to their PF and C counterparts. Both E males and females treated with BZD spent increased time on open arms and decreased time on closed arms compared to their PF and C counterparts, suggesting decreased fear. Further, BZD-treated E males exhibited decreased open and closed arm entries, spent significantly more time in the central area, and had lower CORT levels, another index of fear or stress, compared to BZD-treated PF and C males. These data support and extend previous work demonstrating that the plus-maze provides a reliable measure of anxiety/fear, and that plus-maze behavior is sensitive to anxiolytic agents such as BZD. Furthermore, these data suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure may alter sensitivity to the effects of BZD on plus-maze behavior and CORT responsiveness, and may do so differentially in male and females offspring.",

Numerous chemical substances have been prepared in order to improve the pharmacological profile of inhibition of aldose reductase enzyme. In this study, aldose reductase inhibitory activities of several benzodiazepine derivatives were investigated. The enzyme was obtained from bovine lenses via the ammonium sulphate-protein cut method with several steps.

They are among tranquilizer and antidepressant drug groups respectively. It was shown that both drugs increased the rate of oxygen consumption and displayed uncoupling properties. Mitochondrial respiration raised up slowly after drug addition in the presence of succinate or beta-oxybutyrate as oxidized substrates. If concentration of relanium and melipramine exceeded 1.2 and 0.8 mM respectively the rate of oxygen consumption began to decrease. There was a small reply on addition of ADP in the presence of drugs. At the same time relanium and melipramine decreased respiration rate if they were added at the state 3. It was shown that the drugs increased conductivity of bimolecular phospholipid membranes.", 
    "58": "In the limbic status model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy, hippocampal stimulation induces acute status epilepticus in rats; recurrent, spontaneous seizures develop following an asymptomatic silent period lasting several weeks. Previous work has shown increased excitability and decreased inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons in chronically epileptic animals. To determine the relationship of altered cellular responses to seizure onset, in vitro intracellular recording was used to follow the evolution of changes in synaptic physiology occurring during the seizure-free silent period. Pyramidal cells displayed increasing epileptiform activity throughout the period investigated, 3-14 days following status; the mean number of evoked action potentials from 1.1+/-0.05 in control cells to 2.4+/-0.4 early (3 days after status) and 4. 3+/-0.7 late (14 days) in the silent period. Monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors in silent period cells differed markedly from controls. Area, rise time, and duration of these potentials decreased by 40-60% within 3 days following status and to values commensurate with chronically epileptic animals in 7 to 10 days. gamma-Aminobutyric acid-B receptor-mediated IPSPs diminished more gradually in the silent period, reaching a minimum at day 14. In contrast, presynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor function showed maximum impairment 3 days after status. The benzodiazepine type 1 receptor agonist zolpidem reduced hyperexcitability in both silent period and chronically epileptic cells, but was more effective at unmasking the underlying IPSP in silent period neurons. The results indicate that changes in different components of pyramidal cell inhibitory synaptic physiology associated with chronic epilepsy in this model evolve individually at different rates, but are all complete before seizure onset. Although the results do not imply causality, they do suggest that the development of physiological changes in CA1 pyramidal cells may contribute to the lag period preceding the onset of chronic seizures.", 
    "59": "Mice from 15 standard inbred strains were tested for sensitivity to several effects of acute diazepam (DZ). Strains differed in sensitivity to DZ-induced: low-dose stimulation and high-dose depression of locomotor activity, hypothermia, and ataxia assessed on a rotarod. Correlations among strain means indicated that sensitivity to a particular effect of DZ generalized well across doses. Sensitivities to some of the different behavioral responses also were significantly correlated. For example, strains sensitive to DZ-induced increases in activity were significantly less sensitive to the drug's hypothermic effects. These results suggest that there are multiple genetic determinants of behavioral sensitivity to DZ effects. That is, genetically influenced sensitivity to DZ is not monolithic but is somewhat specific to the particular response variable studied, a result that also characterizes genetic control of responses to other drugs.", 
    "60": "The present studies were undertaken to investigate the neuroactive steroidal modulation of feeding behavior and possible involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA-A) and mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptors (MDR) in food-deprived male mice. Allopregnanolone (0.5-2 mg/kg), a neurosteroid, progesterone (1-10 mg/kg), a neurosteroid precursor, and 4'-chlordiazepam (0.25-1 mg/kg), a specific high affinity MDR agonist, produced a dose-dependent hyperphagic effects. In contrast, neurosteroids pregnenolone sulfate (PS) (1-10 mg/kg) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (1-10 mg/kg) produced a hypophagic effect, in a dose-dependent manner. The allopregnanolone-, progesterone- and 4'-chlordiazepam-induced hyperphagic effect was blocked by picrotoxin (1 mg/kg), a GABA-A chloride channel antagonist, but not by flumazenil (2 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist. The 4'-chlordiazepam-induced hyperphagic effect was prevented by pretreatment with PK11195 (2 mg/kg), a selective partial MDR antagonist. The hypophagic effect of DHEAS (10 mg/kg) was reversed by dizocilpine (10 microg/kg), an NMDA receptor antagonist, but resistant to muscimol (0.1 mg/kg), a selective GABA-A receptor agonist. In contrast, the PS (10 mg/kg)-induced hypophagic response was resistant to dizocilpine, but sensitive to muscimol (0.1 mg/kg). Both the sulfated neurosteroids PS and DHEAS also reversed the hyperphagic effect of allopregnanolone. In addition, the BZD agonist triazolam (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) also produced a flumazenil- and picrotoxin-sensitive hyperphagic effects, thereby suggesting the changes in feeding behavior by neurosteroids represent GABA-A receptor mediated hyperphagic action. Although the possible antistress or anxiolytic actions of neurosteroids may confound the hyperphagia, behavioral effects observed were specific to food because the mice were adopted to the test environment and diet, and of a possible variation between various neurosteroids in the extent to which antistress or anxiolytic effect produced at hyperphagic doses. The hyperphagic effects of progesterone and 4'-chlordiazepam resembled that of neurosteroid allopregnanolone. Therefore, the effect of progesterone may be imputed to its metabolism to allopregnanolone, while the 4'-chlordiazepam-induced hyperphagic response is related to its MDR-stimulated neurosteroidogenesis and subsequent modulation of GABA-A receptors. The hypophagic response following DHEAS may, at least partly, involve an NMDA receptor mechanism. However, PS-induced hypophagia may be mediated by GABA-A or other receptor systems. These data suggest a pivotal role for GABA-A and mitochondrial DBI receptors in the hyperphagic effects of neurosteroids and reinforces a role for endogenous neurosteroids in regulating feeding behavior. Future studies may lead to the development of neurosteroid-based anorectic/hyperphagic agents for therapeutic use.", 
    "61": "AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) excitotoxicity was examined in cultured neocortical neurons using the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to measure cell viability. Neurons were exposed to AMPA at different culture periods during development of the neurons. In order to describe the pharmacology of AMPA-mediated toxicity, several glutamate receptor antagonists were used: MK-801, NS 394, NBQX, GYKI 52466, GYKI 53405 and GYKI 53655. Increased excitotoxicity was observed when cortical neurons cultured for 5, 8 and 12 days in vitro (DIV) were exposed to a high concentration of AMPA (500 microM) for 6 h. However, only at DIV 12 was part of the toxicity mediated directly through AMPA receptors since 10 microM MK-801 blocked all AMPA toxicity at DIV 5 and 8, but only some of the AMPA response at DIV 12. This indicated that NMDA receptors were being activated, causing some of the observed toxicity. The high dose of AMPA was not sufficient to damage all neurons since 59% remained viable after exposure to AMPA even for neurons that were cultured for 12 DIV. Since it is known that both glutamate and AMPA activate AMPA receptors with a fast and rapidly desensitizing response, this could explain the relatively low toxicity produced by 500 microM AMPA. This was investigated by blocking AMPA receptor desensitization with cyclothiazide. Using a lower concentration (25 microM) of AMPA, addition of 50 microM cyclothiazide increased the AMPA induced excitotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons at all DIV except for DIV 2. This combination of AMPA + cyclothiazide yielded 77% cell death for DIV 12 cultures. In contrast to the results observed with 500 microM AMPA, the neurotoxicity mediated directly by AMPA receptors when desensitization was blocked was seen as early as 5 DIV since 10 microM MK-801 did not completely block the response whereas 10 microM NBQX did. The 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI compounds, which have been reported to be selective non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonists, were here observed to block the AMPA toxicity with the following rank order: GYKI 53655 > GYKI 52466 > or = GYKI 53405, which is in agreement with their published potencies.",

Opioid agonists remain the mainstay in the management of cancer pain. Slow-release preparations are currently available for several of these agents. The increased use of opioids has led to the recognition of opioid-induced neurotoxic effects and to the development of effective adjuvant drugs and other strategies to counteract these side effects. A number of drugs are available for the management of symptoms of cachexia, including corticosteroids and progestational drugs. Prokinetic drugs, either alone or in combination with other agents such as corticosteroids, are highly effective in the treatment of chronic nausea. For patients with asthenia, it should first be determined whether there are any reversible causes; if not, corticosteroids and psychostimulants may diminish the symptoms. Haloperidol, other neuroleptics and benzodiazepines may be required to manage hyperactive delirium. Oxygen and opioids are effective in treating dyspnea, whereas there is limited evidence that benzodiazepines provide any relief of this symptom.

    "70": "Having a differential sensitivity to morphine can distinguish migraine suffers from healthy people who are headache-exempt. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether such an abnormal response to morphine challenge is entirely dependent on opioid receptor activation. A role for excitatory amino acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid has been proposed on the basis of the effect of diazepam. As opposed to naloxone, this gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist was found to inhibit the adverse effects of low doses of morphine in migraine sufferers, while at the same time being able to almost abolish morphine-induced miosis in subjects who underwent a short-lasting chronic pretreatment. The capacity of diazepam either to control the adverse effects of morphine or to induce well-being in subjects known to suffer from a central neurogenic pain such as migraine, is noteworthy even regarding the clinical treatment of other painful conditions, such as deafferentation pain, which is known to be not satisfactorily treated by using morphine.", 
    "71": "The functional status of striatal GABAA receptors appears to be inversely related to the magnitude of cocaine-induced behaviors. Exposure of striatum to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODNs) targeted to the mRNAs for the alpha 2 and the beta 3 subunits of the GABAA receptor should decrease expression of receptor proteins and therefore might be expected to increase cocaine sensitivity. ASODNs, scrambled ODNs or saline were injected into right lateral ventricle of rats and behavioral responses to cocaine were tested 18-20 h after treatment. Animals injected separately with alpha 2 or beta 3 ASODNs exhibited increased behavioral sensitivity to cocaine compared to rats injected with saline or scrambled ODNs including performing more 360 degrees turns to the left than to the right. There was significantly less GABA-stimulated Cl uptake in right striatum compared to left striatum of ASODN-treated rats with no significant difference between sides in control animals. Specific binding to benzodiazepine and convulsant sites on the GABAA receptor was not selectively altered by ASODN treatment. Combined alpha 2 beta 3 ASODN treatment did not affect either cocaine sensitivity or GABAA receptor function. There was no difference between the density of Nissl stained cells in the left and right edges of striatum in control or ASODN-treated rats indicating the absence of significant neurotoxic effects of the ASODN treatment. Injection of fluorescein-conjugated ASODNs indicated that ASODN is present in striatum at times during which behavioral and neurochemical indices of GABA receptor function are decreased. Thus, the functional status of GABAA receptors in striatum may be involved in determining cocaine sensitivity.", 
    "72": "Hormonal responses after surgery are characterized by increased pituitary-adrenal axis hormones. We undertook this study to determine whether the choice of anesthesia influences stress hormone levels. Twenty-three adult females scheduled for hysterectomy for benign disease under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of three groups: epidural/propofol anesthesia (Group P), epidural/midazolam anesthesia (Group M), and epidural/sevoflurane anesthesia (Group S). The concentrations of ACTH and cortisol in group P and group M were significantly less than that of group S at 60 min after the incision. The concentrations of beta-endorphin and aldosterone in group P and group M were significantly less than that of group S at 60 min after the incision and after extubation. We conclude that combined epidural and general anesthesia with propofol or midazolam has a greater suppressive effect than sevoflurane on the stress response of the pituitary-adrenal axis during hysterectomy.", 
    "73": "Antiepileptic drug use was documented before and after temporal lobectomy. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and clobazam were the most commonly used drugs, both pre- and postoperatively. Preoperatively, polytherapy was used in 78% of patients; at 6 months follow-up, 47%; at 12 months, 18%; and at 24 months, 14%. Preoperatively, monotherapy was used in 20% of patients; at 6 months follow-up, 49%; at 12 months, 55%; and at 24 months, 42%. No medication was used preoperatively by 2% of patients; at 6 months follow-up, 2%; at 12 months, 27%; and at 24 months, 44% (p < 0.001). After 2 years, 53% of patients who were seizure free had stopped taking medication, as had 33% who had some seizures after surgery.", 
    "74": "Drug use review is used by both the public and private sector to influence prescribing behavior and patient drug use. Past interventions mailed to prescribers have had mixed results. The objective was to evaluate the effect of a one-time, mailed intervention on subsequent use of sedative hypnotic medication.", 
    "75": "An experimental design was used. The intervention contained guidelines for the use of sedative hypnotics, a prescriber profile detailing sedative hypnotic prescribing, and a patient profile. Clustering of patients and their shared prescribers was done to avoid contamination bias and statistical problems associated with a lack of independence of observations. Subjects were 189 Washington State Medicaid recipients who had received at least one tablet per day of a sedative hypnotic medication for 1 year and their prescribing physicians or (when information about the physician was lacking) the dispensing pharmacy.", 
    "76": "A significant reduction in the use of targeted sedative hypnotic medications was measured in the intervention group (-27.6%) versus the control group (-8.5%). In the intervention group, 9.4% of patients began a new prescription for a benzodiazepine not targeted by the drug use review, whereas no control patients had new use of nontarget benzodiazepines.", 
    "77": "The intervention achieved a statistically significant decrease in targeted drug use, and the amount of reduction is likely to have decreased the risk of fractures associated with benzodiazepine use. This study adds to the recent evidence that mailed drug use review interventions can have a desirable impact on patient drug use.", 
    "78": "Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics principally affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Changes in pharmacodynamics are primarily seen in the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine system. Age-dependent changes in the kinetics and dynamics of drugs acting on the cardiovascular system and central nervous system are common, and this review, while by no means exhaustive of the effects of drugs on all organ systems, is reflective of the principles and gives examples of the effects of age on these 2 major systems. While pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly are usually well characterised, pharmacodynamic changes are understood only in the most preliminary way. There has been relatively little research in this area of geriatric clinical pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic changes are still an area of investigation.", 
    "79": "Midazolam is a parenteral benzodiazepine with sedative, amnesic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties. The drug exerts its clinical effect by binding to a receptor complex which facilitates the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Midazolam has a faster onset and shorter duration of action than other benzodiazepines such as diazepam and lorazepam. The most serious adverse events associated with midazolam in children include hypoventilation, decreased oxygen saturation, apnoea and hypotension. It is water soluble in the commercially prepared formulation but becomes lipid soluble at physiological pH and can then cross the blood brain barrier. It is metabolised in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system, and its chief metabolite is 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam. The latter is conjugated to the glucuronide form, and it has only minimal biological activity. Midazolam is excreted primarily by the kidney. Its half-life in children over 12 months is reported to be 0.8 to 1.8 hours, with a clearance of 4.7 to 19.7 ml/min/kg. Doses given to children must be calculated on a mg/kg basis. For children 6 months to 5 years of age the initial dose is 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. A total dose up to 0.6 mg/kg titrated slowly may be necessary to achieve the desired endpoint. For children 6 to 12 years of age the initial dose is 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg with a total dose up to 0.4 mg/kg to achieve the desired end-point.", 
    "80": "To evaluate patients complaining of subjective tinnitus, this study examined their response to peroral betahistine mesilate, vitamin B complex and diazepam in combination. Because three drugs were used together, it remains to be seen whether a single drug or a combination of drugs was effective. We issued questionnaires to 67 patients with tinnitus associated with sensorineural hearing loss of unknown etiology or tinnitus, despite normal hearing in pure tone audiometry and lack of distinct systemic disorders. Our original questionnaire contained seven items and allotted points for each item to facilitate evaluation. After prescribing the above drugs and observing patients' progress for 5 weeks, 50 of the 67 subjects were evaluated again by the same questionnaire. The present study evaluates tinnitus of patients as an example of clinical applications; this was not a controlled double blind study. It was found that, after patients took the prescribed medication, the total number of points were significantly reduced (paired t-test, P < 0.001). After medication, cases of bilateral tinnitus were significantly reduced from 27 to 14, and cases of two types of tinnitus sound, were significantly decreased from 22 to 11 (chi 2-test, P < 0.05). After 5 weeks of administration, 54% of patients felt treatment had been effective. Preliminary results suggest this peroral multi-drug treatment may provide relief for some patients with subjective tinnitus. However, long-term efficacy of the treatment was not investigated.", 
    "81": "Chlorzoxazone (Parafon forte) overdose is rarely reported despite widespread use of this drug. This report describes a case of two episodes of chlorzoxazone overdose and coma in the same patient. Intubation and mechanical ventilation were required on the first presentation. Following the second overdose, intubation was averted and drug effects were reversed by use of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. Although chlorzoxazone is not classified as a benzodiazepine, it may interact with benzodiazepine receptors, thus making flumazenil potentially useful in overdose states.", 
    "82": "The primary care physician is in a good position to diagnose, manage and intervene with patients who are undergoing the process of treatment and recovery from alcohol and drug disorders. Medications such as benzodiazepines are effective in the treatment of withdrawal syndromes, and naltrexone and disulfiram can be used to augment relapse prevention. Patients may also participate in psychosocial methods of addiction treatment that can reduce the risk of relapse and improve their psychosocial, health, legal and employment status.",

    "84": "We studied 108 alcohol-dependent patients consecutively enrolled in an outpatient detoxification program between January 17, 1995, and October 17, 1995. The diagnosis was confirmed by verifying, through chart review, that patients met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence. Patients were prescribed chlordiazepoxide according to a symptom-triggered detoxification protocol that utilized a standardized withdrawal scale. We compiled outcome data by reviewing the chart and the computerized medical record. Outcome was operationally defined to include completion of outpatient detoxification as well as outcome measures that were used in earlier studies of symptom-triggered detoxification in the hospital setting.", 
    "85": "Chlordiazepoxide was administered to only 41 patients (38%), yet 92 (85%) of the 108 enrolled successfully completed outpatient detoxification without medical complications. The patients who took chlordiazepoxide received a mean+/-SD total of 167.2+/-123.5 mg administered over 2.7+/-1.4 days. Mean gamma-glutamyltransferase levels were higher for the group of patients who subsequently received chlordiazepoxide (132.8+/-312.1 IU/L compared with 56+/-80.3 IU/L; Wilcoxon rank sum test, t=2600.5, p < .01).", 
    "86": "This study is the first to support the feasibility of symptom-triggered detoxification from alcohol in an outpatient setting. Our completion rate compared favorably with completion rates from previous studies of outpatient detoxification from alcohol using fixed-dose schedules. The percentage of patients receiving chlordiazepoxide and mean total amount of chlordiazepoxide administered in our study were also comparable to results from previous studies of symptom-triggered detoxification with hospitalized patients.", 
    "87": "Tolterodine [(R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanamine ] is a new potent and competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist developed for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence and other symptoms of overactive bladder. In vivo, tolterodine exhibits functional selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands, a profile that cannot be explained in terms of selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor subtype. The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro and in vivo antimuscarinic profiles of tolterodine with those of muscarinic receptor antagonists with distinct receptor subtype-selectivity profiles: darifenacin [(S)-2-[1-[2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]-2,2-d iphenylacetamide; selective for muscarinic M3 receptors]; UH-AH 37 (6-chloro-5,10-dihydro-5-[(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)acetyl]-11H-dibenzo-[b ,e][1,4]diazepine-11-one; low affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors); and AQ-RA 741 (11-([4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-py rido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one; high affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors). The in vitro profiles of these compounds were in agreement with previous reports; darifenacin and UH-AH 37 demonstrated selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2 receptors, while the converse was observed for AQ-RA 741. In vivo, AQ-RA 741 was more potent (1.4-2.7-fold) in inhibiting urinary bladder contraction than salivation in the anaesthetised cat (i.e., a profile similar to that of tolterodine [2.5-3.3-fold]), while darifenacin and UH-AH 37 showed the reverse selectivity profile (0.6-0.8 and 0.4-0.5-fold, respectively). The results confirm that it is possible to separate the antimuscarinic effects on urinary bladder and salivary glands in vivo. The data on UH-AH 37 and darifenacin support the view that a selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2 receptors may result in a more pronounced effect on salivation than on bladder contraction. The data on AQ-RA 741 may indicate that muscarinic M2/m2 receptors may have a role in bladder contraction.", 
    "88": "The density of GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus and the temporal cortex from rats treated for 28 days with either haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine or olanzapine was measured. Compared to haloperidol (0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and chlorpromazine (0.1 and 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), clozapine and olanzapine (0.1 and 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) markedly decreased the density of GABA(A) receptors in these two brain regions. These data suggest that modulation of GABAergic transmission could be an important action of some antipsychotic drugs.",

    "90": "This paper describes CARL (Computer Assisted Relaxation Learning), a computerized, exposure-based therapy program for the treatment of dental injection fear. The CARL program operates primarily in two different modes; in vitro, which presents a video-taped exposure hierarchy, and in vivo, which presents scripts for a dentist or hygienist to use while working with a subject. Two additional modes are used to train subjects to use the program and to administer behavioral assessment tests. The program contains five different modules, which function to register a subject, train subjects to use physical and cognitive relaxation techniques, deliver an exposure hierarchy, question subjects about the helpfulness of each of the therapy components, and test for memory effects of anxiolytic medication. Nine subjects have completed the CARL therapy program and 1-yr follow-up as participants in a placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the effects of alprazolam on exposure therapy for dental injection phobia. All nine subjects were able to receive two dental injections, and all reduced their general fear of dental injections. Initial results therefore indicate that the CARL program successfully reduces dental injection fear.", 
    "91": "There is extensive evidence that ethanol interacts with a variety of neurotransmitters. Considerable research indicates that the major actions of ethanol involve enhancement of the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at GABAA receptors and blockade of the NMDA subtype of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptor. Ethanol increases GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition, but this does not occur in all brain regions, all cell types in the same region, nor at all GABAA receptor sites on the same neuron, nor across species in the same brain region. The molecular basis for the selectivity of the action of ethanol on GaBAA receptors has been proposed to involve a combination of benzodiazepine subtype, beta 2 subunit, and a splice variant of the gamma 2 subunit, but substantial controversy on this issue currently remains. Chronic ethanol administration results in tolerance, dependence, and an ethanol withdrawal (ETX) syndrome, which are mediated, in part, by desensitization and/or down-regulation of GABAA receptors. This decrease in ethanol action may involve changes in subunit expression in selected brain areas, but these data are complex and somewhat contradictory at present. The sensitivity of NMDA receptors to ethanol block is proposed to involve the NMDAR2B subunit in certain brain regions, but this subunit does not appear to be the sole determinant of this interaction. Tolerance to ethanol results in enhanced EAA neurotransmission and NMDA receptor upregulation, which appears to involve selective increases in NMDAR2B subunit levels and other molecular changes in specific brain loci. During ETX a variety of symptoms are seen, including susceptibility to seizures. In rodents these seizures are readily triggered by sound (audiogenic seizures). The neuronal network required for these seizures is contained primarily in certain brain stem structures. Specific nuclei appear to play a hierarchical role in generating each stereotypical behavioral phases of the convulsion. Thus, the inferior colliculus acts to initiate these seizures, and a decrease in effectiveness of GABA-mediated inhibition in these neurons is a major initiation mechanism. The deep layers of superior colliculus are implicated in generation of the wild running behavior. The pontine reticular formation, substantia nigra and periaqueductal gray are implicated in generation of the tonic-clonic seizure behavior. The mechanisms involved in the recruitment of neurons within each network nucleus into the seizure circuit have been proposed to require activation of a critical mass of neurons. Achievement of critical mass may involve excess EAA-mediated synaptic neurotransmission due, in part, to upregulation as well as other phenomena, including volume (non-synaptic diffusion) neurotransmission. Effects of ETX on receptors observed in vitro may undergo amplification in vivo to allow the excess EAA action to be magnified sufficiently to produce synchronization of neuronal firing, allowing participation of the nucleus in seizure generation. GABA-mediated inhibition, which normally acts to limit excitation, is diminished in effectiveness during ETX, and further intensifies this excitation.", 
    "92": "Dizziness is a common and costly condition that causes significant distress and impairment yet often confounds appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Among patients presenting for evaluation and treatment of dizziness, rates of panic disorder are elevated to 5 to 15 times the general population rates. In addition, the limited studies to date of dizziness in patients with panic disorder suggest that panic patients frequently experience significant dizziness and often demonstrate evidence of vestibular dysfunction. In this paper we review studies investigating the relationship between panic disorder and vestibular dysfunction. Currently, there are three main explanatory models for the association between panic disorder and vestibular dysfunction: the psychosomatic model, the somatopsychic model, and the network alarm theory. Systematic investigations of the treatment of patients with vestibular symptoms and panic disorder are lacking, though prevalence, associated costs, and disability suggest that they are needed. Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are good candidates for future treatment studies.", 
    "93": "While lithium is generally considered to be a first-line treatment for mania, the position of the anticonvulsants and the antipsychotics in the treatment of this disorder is currently under debate. For that reason, this paper reviews the original literature, in particular addressing the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on lithium, anticonvulsants and antipsychotics, and the methodological limitations therein. As the treatment of mania needs to anticipate the future course of the illness, the data on prophylaxis will also be reviewed, albeit briefly. It is concluded that antipsychotics are powerful antimanics, which are particularly beneficial for some clinical presentations of severe mania. However, in general their use should not be prolonged into the maintenance phase. Lithium is still to be considered the mood-stabilizing drug par excellence, although it may be insufficient in mixed states and severe mania. The evidence for antimanic efficacy of valproate, in particular for mixed states, seems more convincing than that for carbamazepine, while the evidence for a prophylactic action of carbamazepine still exceeds that for valproate. Adjunctive treatment with benzodiazepines is often useful. Small sample sizes, highly selected study populations and high drop-out rates seem to be the most important limitations of the RCTs on mania. Quasi-experimental, naturalistic studies on unselected populations are needed to investigate how the various treatments work in clinical practice. Based on the available evidence, summary guidelines for treatment are proposed.",

Additional risk factors for ototoxicity in this particular patient included the presence of end-stage renal disease requiring daily peritoneal dialysis and, possibly, the concomitant use of clonazepam and clindamycin.", 
    "96": "Antibiotic irrigation solutions containing neomycin may produce unwanted adverse systemic effects of deafness and prolonged neuromuscular blockade, even with only brief application within the peritoneal cavity. Concurrent end-stage renal disease, visceral inflammation from chronic dialysis and laparotomy, and the concomitant use of other medications may have contributed to these unwanted effects.",

    "105": "Traditional neuroleptics are often utilized clinically for the management of bipolar disorder. Although effective as antimanic agents, their mood stabilizing properties are less clear. Additionally, their acute clinical side effect profile and long term risk of tardive dyskinesia, particularly in mood disorder patients, portend significant liability. This review focuses on the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar disorder focusing on clozapine as the prototypical agent. Although, preclinical research and clinical experience suggest that the atypical antipsychotics are distinctly different from typical antipsychotics, they themselves are heterogeneous in profiles of neuropharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability. The early clinical experience of clozapine as a potential mood stabilizer suggests greater antimanic than antidepressant properties. Conversely, very preliminary clinical experience with risperidone suggests greater antidepressant than antimanic properties and some liability for triggering or exacerbating mania. Olanzapine and sertindole are under investigation in psychotic mood disorders. The foregoing agents and future drugs with atypical neuroleptic properties should come to play an increasingly important role, compared to the older classical neuroleptics, in the acute and long term management of bipolar disorder.", 
    "106": "We had previously discovered that both diazepam (DZ) and ethanol inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP) in medial perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses and the inhibition was mediated by angiotensin II (Ang II) because it could be blocked by pretreatment with losartan, an Ang II AT1 receptor antagonist. In addition, we had shown that ethanol intoxicating effects on air righting can be significantly reduced by losartan. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of DZ, 1 and 2 mg/kg i.p., on air righting and also the effectiveness of losartan, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg i.p., in blocking the impairment. Also, we examined the effects of losartan pretreatment on the intoxicating effects of 1 g/kg ethanol PO, a dose we had not studied previously. Low doses of ethanol, 1 g/kg, and DZ, 1 mg/kg, appear to be equivalent in the impairment of air righting; and the effects of both drugs were blocked by losartan, in a dose-dependent way. The impairment of air righting due to the larger dose of DZ, 2 mg/kg, was also blocked in a dose-dependent way by losartan; however, even combined large doses of both losartan, 20 mg/kg, and PD 123,319, 20 mg/kg, an Ang II AT2 receptor antagonist, were unable to completely block the initial impairment following the first 15 min after administration. Results can be interpreted in terms of low-dose anxiolytic effects of both drugs and a mild sedation due to the high dose of DZ. The role of the hippocampus in air righting is still not clear and further explanation will depend upon future research.", 
    "107": "Adult female rats, undernourished at perinatal age, were evaluated for anxiolytic action in the plus-maze test after acute and chronic administration of diazepam (DZP) and pentobarbital (PTB). Deprived (D) rats chronically treated with vehicle showed an increased anxiety as compared with control (C) animals. A single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of DZP (1 mg/kg) or PTB (7.5 mg/kg) produced similar anticonflict effect in both C and D rats. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of DZP and PBT developed in C rats after a 15-day administration schedule, whereas no tolerance was observed in D animals. Drug disposition was not altered after chronic treatment either in C or in D rats. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated chloride uptake in microsacs of cerebral cortex of naive D rats was decreased as compared with naive C rats. After chronic DZP administration (1 mg/kg/day i.p. for 15 days), GABA-mediated 36Cl- influx in brain cortex microsacs of C rats did not change; however, GABA efficacy was increased in microsacs of D animals. In addition, chronic DZP treatment induced GABA-benzodiazepine uncoupling in brain cortex of C rats, but not in D animals, as assessed by chloride uptake in microsacs. Chronic PTB treatment (7.5 or 30 mg/kg/day i.p. for 15 days) did not modify GABA stimulation or GABA-PTB interaction in cortical microsacs of C or D rats.", 
    "108": "The effect of intraluminal acid and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor blockade on the pancreatic secretory response was examined in rats. Blockade of gastric acid secretion by YM022 (CCK-B receptor antagonist) or famotidine (histamine-2 receptor antagonist) resulted in a significant suppression of casein-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion as determined by juice volume and amylase secretion. Ligation of the gastric pylorus, which leads to complete prevention of gastric acid from entering the duodenum, also suppressed pancreatic exocrine secretion. FK480 (CCK-A receptor antagonist) inhibited pancreatic exocrine secretion dose dependently at doses of 0.01-1.0 mg/kg. When submaximal doses of FK480 and YM022 were treated concomitantly, pancreatic exocrine secretion was inhibited more profoundly than when treated solely. Hydrochloric acid (HCl; 0.05 N), injected into the duodenum, stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion to a level comparable to that exhibited by intraduodenal casein. This effect of HCl was inhibited by FK480 (1.0 mg/kg) but not by YM022 (1.0 mg/kg). These findings suggest that inhibition of gastric acid secretion leads to the suppression of pancreatic exocrine secretion through mechanisms mediated by CCK-A receptors.", 
    "109": "To examine the effect of stress on skin homeostasis, cutaneous barrier recovery was measured in rate exposed to immobilization stress after tape stripping or sodium dodecyl sulphate treatment. The barrier function was evaluated by measuring transepidermal water loss. Barrier recovery was delayed in rats exposed to stress in comparison with untreated controls. This tendency was observed in both male and female animals. The delay in barrier recovery was blocked by application of the sedative drugs diazepam and chlorpromazine. The barrier recovery rate in mice which were kept at a high population density (10 animals per cage) for 2 weeks was slower than that in mice kept at lower population densities (five animals or one animal per cage). These animal models could be useful for objectively quantifying the influence of stress on the cutaneous function.", 
    "110": "The present study was undertaken to examine the role of the benzodiazepine/GABA and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) systems in the convulsive effect of cocaine in mice. When cocaine (3.5 mg/ml) solution was infused into the tail vein at a rate of 0.3 ml/min, mice showed clonic and tonic convulsions. These seizures were not affected by low doses of bicuculline or picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist and a Cl ion channel blocker, respectively. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a GABA deaminase inhibitor, and phenobarbital, a Cl ion channel activator, and baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, also had no effect on these convulsions. Benzodiazepine inverse agonist beta-DMCM, at a dose which by itself had no convulsive effect lowered the convulsive threshold of cocaine. This lowered convulsive threshold was reversed by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine inverse antagonist, and diazepam, a benzodiazepine full agonist, which by themselves did not inhibit cocaine seizure. It is likely that cocaine seizure involves a benzodiazepine (beta-carboline) recognition site other than the benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor-Cl ionophore complex system. CPP and MK-801, competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, respectively, inhibited cocaine seizures. The inhibitory effects of CPP on cocaine convulsion were reversed by a low dose of NMDA, which by itself did not induce seizure. A dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 enhanced both clonic and tonic convulsions, while a dopamine D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine inhibited these convulsions. These stimulatory and inhibitory effects were reversed by the D1 and D2 receptor antagonists, SCH23390 and haloperidol, respectively. These results suggest that the cocaine-induced convulsion may involve an activation of the NMDA-Ca ionophore complex system, which is mediated by the dopaminergic system, and a beta-carboline recognition site other than the benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor-Cl ionophore complex system.", 
    "111": "The effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was investigated on cortical wedges prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats. GABA evoked concentration-dependent depolarisations (EC50: 0.8 mM), which were attenuated by up to 60% when bicarbonate-buffered aCSF was replaced with HEPES-buffered aCSF. Responses to 1 mM GABA were attenuated by (-)-bicuculline and picrotoxin and were potentiated by chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbitone. Ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists had no effect. We conclude that GABA-evoked depolarisations are mediated via GABAA receptors, arising in part from HCO3- efflux from cells.", 
    "112": "Recent studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective properties of the novel imidazoquinoline benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist, PNU-101017, in the gerbil forebrain ischemia model. The compound effectively reduces delayed post-ischemic (5 min bilateral carotid occlusion) hippocampal CA1 neuronal degeneration even when its administration is withheld until 4 h after reperfusion and the effect is unrelated to hypothermia. The purpose of the present study was to determine the comparative abilities of PNU-101017 versus the full agonist diazepam to attenuate post-ischemic CA1 damage. Male gerbils were treated either 30 min before ischemia induction or immediately after reperfusion with an initial dose of PNU-101017 (30 mg/kg i.p.) or diazepam (10 mg/kg i.p.) with a second dose being given at 2 h after reperfusion. Possible hypothermic effects of either compound were prevented by external heating. In vehicle (0.05 N HCl)-treated gerbils, the loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons at 5 days was 85%. PNU-101017 pretreatment reduced the loss to 50% (p<0.05 vs. vehicle) whereas pretreatment with diazepam attenuated damage to only 17% (p<0.001 vs. vehicle). Delaying treatment with PNU-101017 until just after reperfusion still resulted in a reduction in CA1 degeneration statistically that was indistinguishable from that seen with pretreatment. In contrast, diazepam post-treatment did not significantly decrease CA1 neuronal loss. These results suggest that a benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist may have greater neuroprotective practicality than a full agonist for the treatment of global cerebral ischemia. The mechanistic basis for this difference may relate to the partially pro-excitatory neuronal response to endogenous GABA before and after neuronal insult.", 
    "113": "We have recently observed that concomitant administration of diazepam to morphine pellet implanted rats results in the inhibition of the development of morphine tolerance and dependence. We have now analyzed mu-opioid receptors in rats treated with morphine and diazepam for 5 days by using [3H]-DAMGO for binding studies. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made tolerant and dependent by subcutaneous (s.c.) implantation of six morphine pellets (two pellets on the first day, and four on the second day). Diazepam (0.25 mg/kg b.wt) was injected once daily intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 days. Control rats were implanted with placebo pellets and injected once daily with saline or diazepam (i.p.). Animals were administered s.c. naloxone (10 mg/kg) to induce naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome on the final day of the experiment (day 5). There was an up-regulation of mu-receptor (Bmax increased) in the spinal cord of morphine tolerant (+139%) and dependent (+155%) rats compared to saline treated animals. Diazepam treatment abolished the up-regulation of mu-receptors in spinal cord of morphine treated rats. In the cortex, Bmax was not affected in morphine tolerant or dependent rats but it decreased by 38% in morphine tolerant and 65% in morphine dependent rats treated with diazepam. The Kd of mu-receptors increased in the cortex, striatum and hypothalamus of morphine dependent rats. Diazepam treatment decreased the Kd of mu-receptors in the cortex of morphine tolerant and hypothalamus of morphine-dependent rats. These results suggest that diazepam treatment antagonizes the up-regulation of CNS mu-receptors observed in morphine tolerant rats. In addition, morphine tolerance and dependence may be associated with conversion of mu-opioid receptors to mu-constitutive opioid receptors that are less active, and this conversion is prevented in the brain of animals treated with diazepam.", 
    "114": "Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder causing myotonia, progressive muscle weakness, and endocrine abnormalities including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperresponsiveness to CRH-mediated stimuli. This ACTH hyperresponsiveness appears directly related to the underlying genetic abnormality. Naloxone (Nal)-mediated CRH release causes ACTH release in normal humans and an ACTH hyperresponse in DM. Alprazolam (APZ) attenuates the ACTH release in response to Nal in normal individuals, probably by inhibiting CRH release. This study investigates the effects of APZ on Nal-induced HPA axis stimulation in DM. The ACTH response to Nal in DM subjects was significantly reduced by APZ. Despite this DM patients have a relative resistance to APZ inhibition of Nal-induced ACTH/cortisol release. APZ caused a smaller percentage reduction in AUC for ACTH in DM compared with controls. These findings provide further insight into the mechanism(s) of the HPA axis abnormalities in DM. In DM, there may be an increase in tonic opioid inhibition to CRH release with compensatory increases in stimulatory pathways. Alternatively, these patients may have a basal increase in pituitary vasopressin levels or an enhanced AVP/CRH synergistic mechanism at the level of the corticotroph.", 
    "115": "The octadecaneuropeptide ODN has been originally characterized as an endogenous ligand of central-type benzodiazepine receptors, on its ability to displace the anxiogenic compound beta-[3H]carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester from its binding sites. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anxiogenic effects of intracerebroventricular administration of ODN in mice and rats. At doses ranging from 10 to 100 ng, ODN increased in mice the latency to explore a white compartment when the animals were placed in a black one. ODN also reduced the first stay duration in the white compartment. These effects were antagonized by diazepam (0.075 mg/kg, s.c.) as well as flumazenil (1 mg/kg, s.c.), indicating that ODN acts as an inverse agonist on central-type benzodiazepine receptors. In rats, ODN reduced the latency to enter a black compartment when the animals were placed in the white one. In the plus-maze elevated test, ODN reduced, in both mice and rats, the number of entries and the time spent in the open arm. In mice, ODN (100 ng) increased the thigmotaxis index, i.e. the distance traveled in the peripheral zone of the open field. Time-course studies revealed that a significant effect of ODN (100 ng) in the black/white compartment test was only observed 40 min after the injection and lasted between 3 and 6 h. The effect of a 1000-ng dose of ODN appeared more tardily than that of a 10-ng dose. In addition, a 1000-ng dose of ODN occluded the early effect of a 100-ng dose on the white compartment first stay duration. The COOH-terminal octapeptide of ODN was more rapidly effective than ODN in the black/white compartment test, suggesting that the anxiogenic effect of the peptide requires the formation of biologically active proteolytic fragment.", 
    "116": "This study employed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) 1995 to (1) determine the prevalence of the prescribing of psychotropic drugs for elderly patients by office-based physicians in the United States; (2) estimate the prevalence of the prescribing of potentially inappropriate psychotropic drugs in this patient population; and (3) identify any factors that predict such prescribing. For the purposes of this study, previously developed consensus criteria were adopted defining inappropriate psychotropic drugs as those that should be avoided in the elderly. According to the NAMCS data, psychotropic medications were prescribed in an estimated 12.02 million visits by elderly patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.07-12.97 million). The psychotropic medications most frequently prescribed for elderly patients by office-based physicians were antidepressants and antianxiety agents. The occurrence of visits at which psychotropic medications were prescribed was greater in patients who were over 84 years of age, female, white, or from the western United States. Primary care physicians prescribed the majority of these psychotropic drugs, and most visits to psychiatrists by elderly patients resulted in the prescribing of psychotropic drugs. Office-based physicians prescribed at least one potentially inappropriate psychotropic medication in 2.03 million visits by the elderly (95% CI, 1.70-2.36 million), or 16.87% of visits by the elderly involving prescriptions for psychotropic drugs. The most frequently prescribed potentially inappropriate psychotropic drugs were amitriptyline and long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and flurazepam. Logistic regression analyses revealed that inappropriate prescribing of psychotropic drugs for elderly patients was associated with particular patient characteristics (visit due to an injury), drug characteristics (number of medications prescribed and the drug being an antidepressant or antianxiety agent), and physician characteristics (psychiatric specialty and location in the South or Northeast). The patterns of psychotropic prescribing found in the ambulatory setting raise concerns about the quality of care being received by elderly patients with psychiatric illnesses.", 
    "117": "Overcoming denial and admitting to having a chemical dependency problem is a hurdle that is extraordinarily difficult for anyone to handle without professional assistance. Addicted health care professionals often become even more deeply enmeshed in denial of their problem. They refuse help because they see themselves as educated beyond the level of those who are attempting to help them, and because they fear professional humiliation. Dental professionals who become aware of a colleague's chemical dependence, have an ethical duty to intervene in a constructive way. Reporting to a dental society wellness committee will accomplish this goal while protecting patients, the profession, the addicted provider, and the provider's family. Nonetheless, assisting chemically dependent colleagues to seek treatment can be an enormous burden. Thus, the dental hygienist in the case presented has few choices. She clearly has sufficient evidence of the dentist's chemical dependency problem and, ethically, she must act to prevent harm to patients. If a wellness program is available, it will help her. However, she should not expect gratitude from the dentist at the time of her intervention. Addicted persons rarely thank those who try to help them until much later and whistle-blowers are rarely appreciated. As is often the case, doing the right thing may be a challenge that risks losing a relationship or, as in the case presented, a job.", 
    "118": "The mammalian defense repertory comprises an array of individual behaviors that are extraordinarily sensitive to relevant features of the threat stimulus and the situation in which it occurs. In parallel with increasing awareness of the specificity and complexity of defensive behaviors and of their potential relevance to psychopathologies (e.g. anxiety, panic, and depression) is an escalating use of natural threat stimuli such as attacking conspecifics or predators in paradigms aimed at evaluating drug effects on defense. A review of the literature on benzodiazepine (BZ) and serotonin (5-HT) effects on conspecific and antipredator defense, including defensive analgesia, indicates that both types of stimuli elicit a wide array of relevant defensive behaviors. These studies suggest specificity of drug effects on particular behaviors, rather than a general alteration of all aspects of defense. However, stimulus variability and possible confounding of effects are a considerable problem with conspecific defense paradigms, while antipredator paradigms utilizing human experimenters as the predator may be difficult to use with the domesticated laboratory animal subjects. In addition, sensitivity to the organization of defensive behaviors and to differences between species in defense patterns is necessary to adequate interpretation of results. Nonetheless, these paradigms have permitted major advancements in analysis of the behavioral defense systems and their sensitive use in drug studies will greatly facilitate an understanding of the physiology of defense.", 
    "119": "We report a case of suicide following ingestion of a large dose of 3,4-methylenedioxyethamphetamine (MDEA, \"Eve\") in a 27-year-old woman with a history of depression. Several days before her death, she had attempted suicide with benzodiazepines resulting in a 24-hour hospital admission; at that time, no physiologic abnormalities were detected. Findings on autopsy were nonspecific. Toxicologic analysis showed a high concentration of MDEA and the appearance of benzodiazepines in body fluids. Ethanol and other drugs of abuse were not found. We discuss the clinical manifestations, toxicologic syndromes, and mechanisms of death with amphetamine intoxication. MDEA intoxication in young people may result in sudden death.", 
    "120": "Aged (23-25-month-old) male Long-Evans rats were assessed for deficits in spatial cognition relative to young (4-6-month-old) rats. An in vitro autoradiography study was then conducted for muscarinic M2 sites using [3H]AF-DX 384 to assess binding in basal forebrain and brainstem areas where cholinergic neurons are localized. The analysis of basal forebrain included the medial septal/diagonal band region that provides cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus; the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus were analyzed in the brainstem. A significant age-related reduction in M2 binding was found in both the basal forebrain and brainstem. Only the reduction in the basal forebrain, however, was correlated with spatial learning impairment. Although the basal forebrain and brainstem cholinergic systems are each vulnerable in normal aging, contributions to the behavioral effects of aging may be distinctive for the two systems."
