    "0": "In a brief review the author presents selected results of endocrinological research, published in 1989 to 1990. In the sphere of peptide hormones he mentions findings on the reduced level of the endothelial relaxation factor in the blood stream in atherosclerosis, the classification of endothelin with neuropeptides and the existence of a vasopressin antagonist which causes polyuria after operations of the hypothalamus. Hybrid hormones (biotechnologically prepared combined molecules), mammastatins (inhibitors of proliferation of mammary cell cultures lacking in transformed cultures) and adipsin (a peptide factor lacking in some types of experimental obesity) are other recent advances. Findings on endogenous benzodiazepine substances (occupying receptors for diazepines) and of an endogeneous factor for receptors for tetrahydrocanabinols supplement the contemporary picture. Adrenocortex stimulating immunoglobulins may be the cause of hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex, similarly as TSI is the cause of Graves-Basedow's disease. In the latter evidence of a retroviral aetiology was provided.", 
    "1": "Synaptic inhibition in brain is mainly mediated via GABAA receptors which display a striking structural heterogeneity. A novel type of GABAA receptor subunit, the delta-subunit, has recently been described based on molecular cloning of its cDNA. To identify the prevalence and distribution of GABAA receptors which contain the delta-subunit protein in situ, polyclonal site-directed antisera were developed against three synthetic peptides derived form the rat delta-subunit cDNA-sequence. All antisera specifically recognized a 54 kDa protein in GABAA receptor preparations. Nearly 30% of the GABAA receptors contained the delta-subunit immunoreactivity and displayed high affinity GABA and high affinity benzodiazepine binding sites as shown by immunoprecipitation. Receptors which contain the delta-subunit were immunohistochemically shown to be restricted to a few brain areas such as the cerebellum, thalamus and dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Thus, those neurons which express GABAA receptors with a delta-subunit have now been visualized and made accessible for a functional analysis of this GABAA receptor subtype in situ.", 
    "2": "An association of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous ligand at the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor, with the peripheral type BDZ receptor (PBR) has been reported in the brain and a few peripheral tissues. In order to verify whether or not DBI and PBR are present in the mammary tissue, we have proceeded to the localization of DBI mRNA and PBR in rat mammary glands and DMBA-induced mammary tumors. DBI mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization using a 35S-labelled single-stranded RNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA and PBR by in vitro autoradiography using [3H]PK11195 as the ligand. In mammary glands from virgin and lactating animals, both DBI mRNA and PBR were detected in acinar cells. In dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced tumors, hybridization signal was not detected in all the cells whereas PBR appeared to be present in all the tumoral cells, although non uniformly distributed. These data indicating that mammary DMBA-induced tumoral cells contain both DBI and PBR suggest that BZD receptors might be involved in the regulation of mammary glands as well as mammary tumoral cells.", 
    "3": "The effects, of the benzodiazepines RO5-4864, AHN 086, PK 11195 and clonazepam on respiration of mitochondria from heart, kidney, and liver were studied. ADP-stimulated respiration of heart mitochondria was the most sensitive to inhibition by AHN 086; clonazepam was not inhibitory. Several respiratory chain segment activities of submitochondrial particles were insensitive to AHN 086, except for NADH oxidase which was partially inhibited. However, in contrast to submitochondrial particles, the succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity in intact mitochondria was inhibited by AHN 086, suggesting an effect at the substrate transport level. Phosphate-induced, succinate-dependent swelling was also inhibited by AHN 086 it was not affected by clonazepam. Uncoupled ATP hydrolysis was partially inhibited by RO5-4864, AHN 086, and clonazepam. It is suggested that there is an unspecific inhibition of NADH oxidase and ATP hydrolysis by these benzodiazepines and a specific inhibition on oxidizable substrate transport by the peripheral-type benzodiazepine AHN 086.", 
    "4": "Anxiety and mood disorders are among the psychic afflictions which tend to lead to prolonged benzodiazepine intake. This is also one of the reasons why doctors are faced with a difficult task when having to differentiate between these phenomena and the anxiolytic withdrawal syndrome. Since preexisting psychiatric pathology may modify withdrawal symptoms, thus making differential diagnosis between withdrawal syndrome and recrudescence of the previous disorder even more difficult, it is necessary carefully to assess clinical phenomenology both in relation to its course and to its variability with possible emergence of new symptoms. In addition to drawing attention to the diagnostic elements that can be most useful for identifying the withdrawal syndrome in mood disturbances and panic attack disorder, the authors also report the data of an experimental study of benzodiazepine withdrawal in patients suffering from generalized anxiety.", 
    "5": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain, is known to interact with two classes of GABA receptors denoted GABAA and GABAB. Using Xenopus oocytes, we compared the electrical and pharmacological properties of GABA receptors expressed by poly(A)+ RNA isolated from mammalian brain and retina. RNA from cerebral cortex expressed GABA responses with features characteristic of currents mediated by GABAA receptors. In contrast, RNA from retina expressed responses mediated by GABAA receptors and, in addition, GABA responses that were insensitive to the GABAA antagonist bicuculline and the GABAB agonist baclofen and showed no modulation by barbiturates or benzodiazepines. The bicuculline/baclofen-insensitive GABA response was a Cl- current that was blocked by picrotoxin but showed little desensitization or outward rectification. Our results suggest that mammalian retina contains RNAs encoding GABA receptors with distinct pharmacology.", 
    "6": "Ultrasonic vocalization was induced by either high intensity acoustic stimuli or by electric footshock in the rat. High intensity acoustic stimuli elicit a startle response, while electric footshocks provoke an immediate withdrawal of the feet often accompanied by a pain reaction. Flunitrazepam (0.5 mg/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg), and ipsapirone (5 mg/kg) reduced the vocalization induced by both averse stimuli. Maprotiline (10-25 mg/kg) enhanced the vocalization. FG 7142 (10 mg/kg) had no effect. The acoustic startle-induced vocalization paradigm like the electric footshock-induced vocalization paradigm may provide a simple and reliable tool in the study of anxiety. The advantage of an acoustic pulse as the averse stimulus is discussed.", 
    "7": "A murine monoclonal antibody, mAb 8523, raised against whole human pro-monocytic U937 cells recognizes an 18 kDa antigen in human neutrophils (PMN), as determined by immunoprecipitation and by immunodetection on Western blots of SDS-PAGE of PMN membrane fractions. That is 18 kDa antigen corresponds to the phagocyte peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBZDR) is evidenced by its co-migration with the 18 kDa covalently labeled PBZDR, detected by autoradiography, and their co-modulation upon phorbol-myristate-acetate activation of PMN. Purified mAb 8523 (IgG2b) is able to dose-dependently and specifically stimulate both the basal and the FMLP-induced oxidative burst of intact human PMN, assessed by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence. This property of the first described monoclonal antibody against PBZDR supports the implication of this receptor in NADPH-oxidase activation and consequently in phagocyte-dependent host defense mechanisms.", 
    "8": "Isolated dog submandibular gland cells synthesize platelet-activating factor (PAF) when stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh). This production of PAF was concentration- and time-dependent, and was inhibited by pretreatment with anticholinergic agents. PAF that had accumulated in cells through prior stimulation with ACh vanished rapidly on addition of atropine. Phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride produced an accumulation of PAF in non-stimulated cells and greatly potentiated further ACh-induced accumulation. PAF production and [14C] arachidonic acid (AA) liberation induced by ACh were increased by higher concentrations of extracellular Ca2+, and ACh failed to stimulate PAF formation in the absence of Ca2+, although ACh still stimulated the liberation of [14C]AA without Ca2+. Both the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in intact cells and Ca2+ (at concentrations greater than or equal to 300 nM) in digitonin-permeabilized cells facilitated PAF formation. 1-O-Alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF):acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activity rapidly increased in cells incubated with ACh or ionomycin. These results suggest, at least, that the stimulation of a remodelling pathway is involved in the increased PAF synthesis induced by ACh. Dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase activity was also activated by ACh. However, the activation of both enzymes by ACh was transient, in spite of the fact that ACh-stimulated PAF formation was continuous. This may suggest that additional mechanism(s) other than the activation of these enzymes play an important role in controlling PAF synthesis. The present study provides further evidence that the exocrine submandibular gland cells of dogs have the capacity to increase PAF turnover upon stimulation in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and retain PAF within the cells partly associated with the membrane and partly released into the cytosol.", 
    "9": "The present study shows that postnatal 'consistent' handling (CH; which consisted of removing the pups from the nest and placing them individually in plastic cages lined with paper towel for a period of 15 min daily between 1 and 22 postnatal days) of rats had long-lasting improving effects on coping with a stressful task (i.e. enhancement on the early acquisition of two-way active avoidance), but such effects were completely prevented when CH treatment was combined with chronic perinatal Ro 15-1788 (7 mg/kg/day, between prenatal day 19 and postnatal day 22) administration (i.e. blockade of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR)). A long-lasting decremental effect was also observed in the same task in rats which received postnatal 'inconsistent' handling (INCH; in which stimulation of pups was changed every day between 1 and 22 postnatal days), without being affected by the concomitant perinatal Ro 15-1788 treatment. These results suggest that intact ontogeny of BZRs is necessary to obtain the enduring positive effects of CH on emotional behavior (i.e. early acquisition of two-way active avoidance).", 
    "10": "The effects of systemic treatment with the CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260, its 3S-(-) enantiomer and the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide were assessed in the plus-maze procedure in mice. L-365,260 (1-1000 micrograms.kg-1 i.p.) produced a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of entries into, and the percentage of time spent in the open arms. Total arm entry was not consistently modified. Neither the 3S-(-) enantiomer of L-365,260 nor devazepide (both administered at 100-10,000 micrograms.kg-1) enhanced the exploratory behavior of mice. These results suggest that CCK-B, rather than CCK-A antagonists may possess 'anxiolytic' properties in mice.", 
    "11": "Synaptosomes prepared from brains of rats were incubated in different concentrations of diazepam under conditions designed to reduce the action of a reversed Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In synaptosomes depolarized in the presence of added Ca2+, doses of diazepam ranging from 0.1 to 100 microM were found to significantly enhance Ca2+ levels measured with the fluorescent dye fura-2, compared to control incubations without drug. Furthermore, doses of diazepam as low as 1 microM significantly increased the concentration of Ca2+ in non-depolarized synaptosomes without added Ca2+ in the medium. The effects of depolarization and diazepam treatment were synergistic in increasing the levels of intrasynaptosomal Ca2+.", 
    "12": "The effects of habituation and inhibitory avoidance training on the rat brain regional levels of benzodiazepine (BZD)-like molecules and on central type BZD binding sites were examined. BZD-like immunoreactivity was decreased by 26-50% in the amygdala, cerebral cortex and septum of rats sacrificed immediately after stepping-down from the platform of an inhibitory avoidance apparatus (non-trained group) as compared to naive controls. Rats submitted to a second step-down session 20 h later (habituated group) have significantly lower BZD-like immunoreactivity in the septum (-60%) as compared to non-trained animals. Rats exposed to an inhibitory avoidance training, i.e. stepping-down and receiving a footshock (trained group), showed a significant reduction in the content of BZD-like molecules in cerebral cortex (-44%), amygdala (-68%), septum (-80%) and hippocampus (-82%) as compared to non-trained rats. In addition, the density of central type BZD binding sites was slightly increased in the hippocampus and septum of trained rats. No changes were observed in the apparent dissociation constant. No changes were observed in parallel measurements of [3H]-L-quinuclidinyl benzylate binding constants at cholinergic muscarinic binding sites. The immediate posttraining intrahippocampal bilateral injection of the central type BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 nmol/hippocampus), enhanced the retention of habituation but not when injected in the amygdala or septum. In contrast, retention of the inhibitory avoidance task was significantly increased by flumazenil administered bilaterally into any of the 3 brain structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "The influence of diazepam, an agonist, and flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), an antagonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, on repetitive firing of action potentials in cultured spinal neurons and on voltage-dependent Na+ currents in cultured N2A neuroblastoma cells was examined. The effects were compared to those of the antiepileptics phenytoin and carbamazepine and the local anesthetic lidocaine. The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used for potential and current recording. Diazepam (10 microM) or phenytoin (10 microM) reduced the duration of repetitive action potential discharges in 50 or 67% of the spinal neurons, respectively. At a concentration of 100 microM repetitive firing was completely blocked. Flumazenil (100 microM) had no effect. In N2A neuroblastoma cells diazepam, phenytoin, carbamazepine and lidocaine, but not flumazenil, at a concentration of 100 microM reduced the Na+ current to 60-67% of control. At 10 microM no or only a weak depression was seen with any drug. In the presence of diazepam (100 microM) the Na+ channel inactivation curve was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction by -4.8 +/- 0.5 mV. Phenytoin, carbamazepine and lidocaine (all 100 microM) caused stronger shifts of -17.4 +/- 2.1, -10.6 +/- 0.9 and -17.0 +/- 2.1 mV, respectively. Inhibition of the Na+ current by diazepam increased use-dependently over 9 depolarizing pulses repeated at high frequency (200 Hz), whereas use-dependent effects of the other compounds developed less rapidly. At a low stimulation rate (7 Hz) use-dependent block was pronounced with lidocaine, but weak or absent with diazepam and carbamazepine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "The interaction of tomaymycin and 8-O-methyltomaymycin with calf thymus DNA was studied by steady-state fluorescence techniques. The 8-phenolic proton of tomaymycin has a pK = 8.0, and the phenolate anion is essentially nonfluorescent. However, the fluorescence of the DNA adduct does not decrease until pH greater than 10.5, when the DNA double helix denatures. Acrylamide quenches the fluorescence of the free antibiotic with a quenching rate constant kq = 7 x 10(9) M-1 s-1. In DNA adducts, the quenching rate constant is reduced about 50-fold, indicating that the aromatic ring of the drug is shielded from the solvent. The four possible binding modes of the antibiotics were modeled on a 6-mer duplex by molecular mechanics calculations in the absence and presence of water and counterions. The modeling studies show that the antibiotic is buried in the minor groove in all binding modes, with the 8-substituent pointing away from the DNA core. Three or five waters are displaced from the minor groove, depending on the orientation of the drug on the DNA.", 
    "15": "The functional integrity of the GABAA receptor-benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site-Cl- ionophore complex was assessed by means of [35S]TBPS (t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate) binding to frontal cortex membranes prepared from frozen postmortem brain tissue taken from control (n = 4), Alzheimer (n = 7), Parkinson (n = 3) and Huntington's chorea (n = 2) patients. Specific [35S]TBPS binding was similar in control, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea brains, but was significantly reduced (78% control, P less than 0.01) in frontal cortex membranes from Alzheimer's patients. The linkage between the BZ recognition sites and the GABAA receptor-linked Cl- ionophore was functionally intact in these membranes as BZ site agonists (zolpidem, alpidem, flunitrazepam and clonazepam) enhanced [35S]TBPS binding under the conditions used (well-washed membranes in the presence of 1.0 M NaCl). Zolpidem (BZ1 selective) exhibited a biphasic enhancement in control membranes whereas the other compounds induced a bell-shaped concentration-response curve. The enhancement of [35S]TBPS binding by alpidem, flunitrazepam and clonazepam was greater in frontal cortex membranes from Alzheimer's patients than in controls whereas it tended to be reduced in membranes from the brains of Huntington's chorea patients. These studies demonstrate the functional integrity of the GABAA receptor macromolecular complex and also the usefulness of [35S]TBPS binding in the study of human postmortem tissue.", 
    "16": "The potency of several different non-selective and type I-benzodiazepine receptor-selective ligands as inhibitors of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was measured in different rat brain tissues. In contrast to the non-selective ligands, which had a similar potency in all brain tissues investigated, the potency of the type I-receptor-selective ligands was highest in cerebellar membranes and varied in other brain tissues.", 
    "17": "The authors studied 34 patients undergoing abdominal total hysterectomy in order to evaluate whether epidural clonidine added to lidocaine solution could alter the requirements of sedatives during epidural anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups; 18 ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 clonidine (n = 6), 1:100,000 clonidine (n = 7), 1:200,000 epinephrine (n = 13), or neither (plain, n = 8). The requirements of sedatives (diazepam, thiamylal) and analgesic (butorphanol) prior to the second epidural injection were compared among the four groups. The dose of intravenous diazepam or thiamylal required for sedation in the patients receiving lidocaine with 1:100,000 clonidine had a tendency to be smaller as compared with those in other three groups. There was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) in the requirement of diazepam between the patients given lidocaine with 1:100,000 clonidine and those given plain lidocaine. The present results suggest that the addition of clonidine to lidocaine solution could reduce the requirements of sedatives in epidural anesthesia.", 
    "18": "The length of certain implant surgery operation as well as their precision requires the complete cooperation of patients. The vigilambulant anesthesia, regularly used in other medical specialties, ensures in total security, anxiolism, sedation, analgesia and amnesia for patients. The presence of an anesthesist having at his disposal all the material and all drugs for anesthesia and reanimation gives the surgeon an unequalled operatory comfort.", 
    "19": "This article presents data on the relationship between the recent drinking histories of 80 healthy men aged 18 to 25 years and their intensities of reaction to challenges with 0.75 ml/kg of ethanol, 0.12 mg/kg of diazepam, and 0.20 mg/kg of diazepam. Significant and consistent negative correlations between the usual quantity x frequency of alcohol intake and scores on all 13 items of the Subjective High Assessment Scale were demonstrated. Expectation of the effects of alcohol appears to be an important mediator of these relationships, although other factors may be involved as well. Although few significant relationships were observed for more objective measures of reactions to the challenges, these data underscore the potential effect of drinking history on evaluations of subjective feelings following challenges with these drugs.", 
    "20": "General principles of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy are reviewed, current issues involving the use and monitoring of AEDs are examined, promising investigational agents are briefly reviewed, and situations that require potentially difficult decisions about long-term care are discussed. The initial treatment should be monotherapy with a first-line AED for the particular seizure disorder. The usual approach is to maximize seizure control and minimize the adverse effects of AED therapy. Current issues involving the pharmacokinetics, use, and monitoring of the conventional AEDs phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, valproic acid, ethosuximide, benzodiazepines, and acetazolamide are discussed. AED therapy may have adverse effects on behavior and cognition. The risk of teratogenicity with well-monitored AED therapy is probably low, and severe hepatotoxicity is uncommon. Because carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone all have enzyme induction properties, a number of clinically important interactions are possible. Issues related to discontinuing AED therapy, serum concentration monitoring, and generic interchange of AED products are addressed. Whether AEDs should be used to prevent recurrent febrile seizures, alcohol withdrawal seizures, or seizures in patients with head trauma or stroke must be considered. The treatment of seizure disorders is a complex process involving identification of the seizure disorder, selection and monitoring of an appropriate AED(s), and consideration of adverse effects and drug interactions. Whether therapy should be discontinued after a prolonged seizure-free period, compliance issues, and whether to treat certain conditions prophylactically also must be considered.", 
    "21": "We evaluated the electrophysiological parameters before and after the intravenous infusion of diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) in 20 cardiac patients to investigate the drug's antiarrhythmic effect. Diazepam did not significantly change the arterial pressure. After the intravenous infusion of diazepam, the sinus cycle length significantly shortened from 847 +/- 132 to 747 +/- 155 ms (p less than 0.01). No significant change in the maximal sinus node recovery time was noted. The AH interval at the atrial pacing length of 600 ms shortened significantly from 140 +/- 40 to 127 +/- 39 ms (p less than 0.05). However, there was no significant change after the administration of diazepam in the longest atrial pacing rate associated with Wenckebach conduction in the atrioventricular (AV) node, effective and functional refractory periods of the AV node, HV interval, and QRS width during ventricular pacing at the cycle length of 600 ms. The atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods remained unchanged after the administration of diazepam. Six of the eight patients who showed dual AV nodal refractory period curves in the control study did not demonstrate them after diazepam administration by increasing the atrial or AV node effective refractory period. Thus, diazepam showed significant electrophysiological effects of the heart including shortening of the sinus cycle length, improvement in AV node conduction, and no significant effect on the His-Purkinje or intraventricular conduction and refractoriness of the atrium, AV node and ventricle. On the other hand, diazepam may influence the inducibility of supraventricular reentrant tachycardia incorporating the AV node.", 
    "22": "During the past 7 years in Canada, more than 1,300 refractory epileptic patients have been treated with clobazam (CLB) by 104 adult and pediatric neurologists. Using a standard case report, 32 neurologists, who had each treated greater than or equal to 10 patients, provided retrospective data for 877 patients. The population had the following characteristics; the percentages of children and adults were 51 and 49%, respectively; 38% of the patients were mentally retarded; the percentages for single and multiple seizure type diseases were 46 and 54%, respectively; and adults had more complex partial seizures, whereas children had more atypical absence and myoclonic types. Before clobazam, patients received an average of 2 other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (range 0-5 AEDs). Average dose of CLB in children was 0.87 mg/kg per day (range 0.05-3.8 mg/kg per day) and in adults 30 mg/day (range 2.5-150 mg/day). Duration of CLB therapy ranged from a few days to greater than 4 years, with 40% being treated greater than 1 year. Using Kaplan-Meier curves, we found that 4 years after starting, 40-50% of patients continued CLB. More than 40% of patients with single seizure type had at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency (improved). At least 60% of patients with multiple seizure type had improvement in one or more seizure types, and nearly 40% of the patients had all their seizure types improved. The seizure frequency for each seizure type, except tonic, was reduced greater than 50% in 40-50% of patients and by 100% in 10-30% of patients. Twenty percent stopped CLB for poor efficacy, 4% stopped for safety-related reasons including drug interactions, and 8% stopped for both reasons. Possible side effects (predominantly somnolence) were reported by 32%; however, in only 11% were the side effects sufficiently severe to cause discontinuation of medication. \"Tolerance,\" leading to discontinuation of CLB, was reported for 9%. Patients treated with CLB for at least 1 year were generally maintained with CLB greater than 1 year. Thus, CLB is useful in refractory epilepsy of all types, suggesting that a monotherapy trial in less severe epilepsy is now desirable.", 
    "23": "The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (0.01 mg/kg) has been compared with doxapram (1 mg/kg) and saline for the reversal of anaesthesia with intravenous midazolam, alfentanil, nitrous oxide in oxygen and isoflurane. The completeness of reversal was assessed by means of a four-choice reaction time test, 1 and 3 h following the antagonist. In addition, the level of sedation was graded using a five-point scale. Psychomotor testing showed that 60 min after administration of the antagonist, there were marked increases in reaction times (P less than 0.05) both in the control and doxapram groups, but not in those receiving flumazenil. At 180 min, however, reaction times in all groups had returned to baseline values. In contrast, there was a significant difference in the sedation scores between the saline and flumazenil groups throughout the study period (P less than 0.05). During the 4 h following midazolam, there was no evidence of re-sedation in any of the groups despite the relatively high midazolam dosage.", 
    "24": "The effect of an assessment dose of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was studied in 20 patients in an intensive care unit. The patients had been sedated with alfentanil and midazolam, and were ready to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. In 10 patients flumazenil was titrated just to produce full arousal whilst the midazolam infusion was continued; flumazenil administration was repeated one hour later after the infusion of midazolam had been stopped. In another 10 patients, flumazenil was administered only once, coinciding with the cessation of sedation. The duration of full arousal in both groups was less than 15 minutes in 75% of patients given a single dose of flumazenil (median dose 0.4 mg) although some effect persisted for up to 60 minutes. The cardiovascular effects of arousal were transient and probably not clinically significant. A brief duration of action is advantageous if the patient is found still to require sedation.", 
    "25": "A combination of midazolam and droperidol given intramuscularly was compared with papaveretum and hyoscine for premedication of patients about to undergo cardiac surgery. Midazolam and droperidol proved to be a very satisfactory combination, producing superior sedation and anxiolysis with good cardiovascular stability.", 
    "26": "Acetylcholine is present in a majority of submucosal neurons which project to the intestinal epithelium. In this study, we examined the role of acetylcholine and the actions of cholinomimetic drugs, such as carbachol (CCH), on ion transport across muscle-stripped sheets of mucosa-submucosa from the proximal jejunum of weaned piglets. Serosal administration of CCH (10 nM-100 microM) produced rapid increases in short-circuit current (Isc) which were attributed to net Cl secretion. Acetylcholine, bethanechol and (4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)-1-trimethylammonium m-chlorocarbanilate chloride were partially effective in increasing Isc. Atropine and selective muscarinic cholinergic antagonists produced dextral shifts in the CCH concentration-effect relationship with an order of relative potency of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) greater than atropine much greater than pirenzepine greater than 11-[[[2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one(AF-DX116). The muscarinic receptor blocker [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) bound specifically and saturably to two sites in the mucosa-submucosa having equilibrium dissociation constants of approximately 10 +/- 3 and 890 +/- 120 pM and Bmax = 7 +/- 3 and 47 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Selective cholinergic antagonists competed for [3H]QNB binding with a rank order of affinity of 4-DAMP greater than hexahydrosiladifenidol much greater than AF-DX 116 greater than or equal to pirenzepine. Specific [3H]QNB binding sites were autoradiographically localized in the jejunal wall to the epithelium, submucosa, and muscularis propria. Electrical transmural stimulation (10-300 pulses/10 sec, 0.5 msec duration, 60 V stimulus strength) delivered to mucosal sheets produced tetrodotoxin-sensitive Isc elevations which were proportional to the number of impulses delivered. Mucosal Isc responses to electrical stimulation were attenuated by 10 microM hexamethonium, 1 microM atropine or autotachyphylaxis to CCH. Tetrodotoxin, at 0.1 microM, produced a 20-fold increase in the secretory potency of CCH. These results suggest that acetylcholine released from intramural neurons in porcine proximal jejunum produces transepithelial Cl secretion. Its effects may be mediated through interactions with two populations of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, located on neuronal and non-neuronal cells within the intestinal mucosa and submucosa, which serve to inhibit and promote Cl secretion respectively.", 
    "27": "Humans were trained to discriminate between 10 mg of diazepam (DZ) and placebo. Subjects reported to the laboratory in the morning several times a week for a total of 23 sessions. They filled out subjective effects questionnaires, ingested a capsule and then were free to leave. They also filled out questionnaires 1, 3 and 6 hr after leaving. During the first four sessions the drugs were identified to the subject before ingestion by letter code. During the next seven sessions the procedure was the same except the capsules were not identified to the subject. Six hours after receiving the capsule, subjects telephoned the experimenter to report their identification. When correct, they received a monetary bonus. If the identification was correct on five of the seven sessions, subjects entered the third phase. This phase had six additional training sessions as described previously. During the other six sessions that were intermixed, subjects received capsules that contained test drugs. Sixteen of 18 subjects learned the discrimination and 14 entered the third phase. They identified 2 mg of DZ, 1 mg of lorazepam and 10 mg of d-amphetamine as placebo and 2 mg of lorazepam as 10 mg of DZ. Over half of the subjects identified 5 mg of DZ and 50 mg of pentobarbital as 10 mg of DZ. DZ (10 mg) produced significant time-related changes on several subjective effect measures and these effects were typical of those produced by sedative-like drugs. The subjective effects of the test compounds were largely correlated with the drug identification. These results indicate that 10 mg of DZ can function as a discriminative stimulus in humans and this discrimination is dose-related and pharmacologically specific.", 
    "28": "We developed a reversed-phase chromatographic procedure for detecting benzodiazepines and other drugs in serum. A liquid-liquid extraction step with hexane/ethyl acetate isolates the drugs from serum; absolute recoveries are generally greater than 85%. Reconstituted extracts are chromatographed on a 4-microns (particle size) C18 column; 14 drugs and an internal standard (flunitrazepam) are separated in 8 min. Peak detection, purity checking, and identification are performed with a computerized photodiode-array detector. Run-to-run imprecision (CV) for many benzodiazepines is less than 3%. In a study of 126 specimens from Emergency Department patients, the procedure showed excellent agreement with a gas-chromatographic method involving either mass-spectrometric or flame-ionization detection. This single procedure provides rapid and accurate detection, quantification, and confirmation of benzodiazepines in serum.", 
    "29": "We have compared, in a double-blind study, the efficacy of flumazenil with that of aminophylline in antagonizing the effects of midazolam in 60 patients (ASA I-II, mean age 66 yr) undergoing transurethral resection of prostate under spinal anaesthesia. All patients received midazolam 0.075 mg kg-1 i.v. and the test drugs were given 5 min after its administration. Patients were allocated randomly to receive i.v. flumazenil 0.01 mg kg-1, aminophylline 2 mg kg-1 or placebo saline 0.1 ml kg-1. One minute after administration, aminophylline caused 42% reversal of sedation, 66% of disorientation and 73% of lack of co-operation in comparison with placebo, although there was marked individual variation. Flumazenil caused complete and rapid antagonism of sedation, disorientation and lack of cooperation.", 
    "30": "Measurement of clinically relevant benzodiazepine drug effects at hypnotic and anxiolytic doses has been difficult because most measures are subjective, difficult to interpret, or relate to anesthetic doses. A potentially useful measure of drug effect is postural sway, which is a manifestation of the corrective mechanisms associated with the maintenance of upright posture. Postural sway was measured over 8 hours, with a biomechanics force platform, in six healthy male volunteers who received triazolam, 0.125, 0.250, or 0.375 mg, or placebo in a randomized double-blind study. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in postural sway measured as the elliptical area or the 95% confidence ellipse for the area covered by the subjects' sway. After triazolam, 0.250 and 0.375 mg, the area under the sway-time curve and peak effect increased significantly compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). The number of losses of balance when subjects stood on one foot also showed a significant increase with increased dose (p less than 0.05). The rate of loss of balance was positively correlated with the extent of postural sway (r = 0.802; p less than 0.001). The extent of sway when the subjects were drug free predicted this increase in a subject's postural sway with triazolam. Thus at hypnotic or anxiolytic doses of triazolam, computer-assisted force platform measures of sway provide a clinically relevant measure of drug effect. Measurement of drug-induced postural sway may be useful in persons at risk for falls, such as the elderly.",

    "32": "The medical charts were studied for all patients admitted to a 20-bed AIDS inpatient ward from July through December 1986. One hundred and fifty-one patient-admissions comprised the sample. The average age of the patients was 37 years, and the average length of the hospital stay was 13 days. Retrospective chart review collected demographic data, length of stay, medical diagnosis, psychiatric history, and mental status on admission. Data on psychoactive drugs included the reasons for use, maximum daily dose and duration, and side effects ascribed to the drugs.", 
    "33": "Psychoactive drugs were used in 89% of the cases. Anxiolytics accounted for 49% of the psychoactive prescriptions, and hypnotics made up 43% of these prescriptions. The five most frequently used psychoactive drugs were benzodiazepines. The most frequent reasons for psychotropic prescriptions were insomnia (39%), psychologic distress (20%), and nausea (16%). The most frequently used anxiolytic and anti-psychotic medications were used in moderate dosage, while the most frequently used antidepressant was prescribed in low dosage.", 
    "34": "Hospitalized AIDS patients are highly likely to be prescribed a psychotropic medication, especially an anxiolytic or hypnotic. Anxiolytics are used for several purposes, including reduction of nausea associated with the use of antibiotics. Antidepressants and antipsychotics are rarely used. Practitioners must be sensitive to the presence of psychiatric conditions presenting as insomnia or disturbed mood so that the most specific and appropriate treatments can be used.", 
    "35": "We conducted a series of experiments to determine if anticholinergics induce immediate cutaneous wheal-and-flare responses in normal volunteers. We performed intradermal skin testing in seven healthy volunteers (three atopic and four nonatopic) with 20 nmol of atropine. All subjects had an immediate wheal-and-flare response to atropine. To determine if this cutaneous response was due to anticholinergics in general, skin testing was also performed to scopolamine and ipratropium. These agents also produced immediate wheal-and-flare responses in all subjects, but they less potent than atropine. Pretreatment with antihistamines equivalently inhibited wheal-and-flare responses to both histamine and atropine, indicating a possible mast cell role. The potential role of M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes was evaluated by use of the selective antagonists, pirenzepine (M1), 11[[2-1[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AFDX-116) (M2), and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) (M3). Cutaneous wheal responses induced by pirenzepine and 4-DAMP were relatively equivalent and larger than responses induced by AFDX-116 at doses less than 200 nmol. At 200 nmol, all three muscarinic receptor subtype antagonists induced equivalent wheal formation. We then compared the cutaneous wheal responses to these specific muscarinic receptor antagonists based on their relative affinity for their respective muscarinic receptor subtype. This comparison suggested that M1 or M2, but not M3, muscarinic receptor subtypes may be important in anticholinergic-induced cutaneous wheal-and-flare responses. We propose that there may be an M1 or M2 muscarinic autoreceptor that inhibits the release of acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "A multidimensional evaluation of 78 patients with primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) revealed no significant relationship between clinical measures of physical discomfort and psychological measures. This observation provided evidence against the notion that the pain of PFS has a psychological etiology. The same patients were randomized into 4 groups for treatment with ibuprofen and/or alprazolam in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Clinical improvement in patient rating of disease severity and in the severity of tenderness upon palpation was most apparent in the subgroup of patients who were receiving both ibuprofen and alprazolam. An 8-week, open-label study in which 52 patients received both drugs further documented improvement in outcome measures. These data indicate that treatment with a combination of ibuprofen and alprazolam can be beneficial for some patients with PFS.", 
    "37": "Forty patients with a history of difficulty discontinuing long-term, daily benzodiazepine therapy were randomly assigned, under double-blind conditions, to treatment with carbamazepine (200 to 800 mg/d) or placebo. A gradual taper (25% per week reduction) off benzodiazepine therapy was then attempted. Five weeks after taper, significantly more patients who had received carbamazepine than placebo remained benzodiazepine free, this despite the fact that no statistically significant differences in withdrawal severity could be demonstrated. Patients receiving carbamazepine reported a larger reduction in withdrawal severity than patients receiving placebo, but only at a trend level, and only on the daily patient-rated withdrawal checklist. Eleven patients (28%) required antidepressant therapy for depression or panic when assessed at 12-weeks follow-up. The results of this pilot investigation suggest that carbamazepine might have promise as an adjunctive drug therapy for the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, particularly in patients receiving benzodiazepines in daily dosages of 20 mg/d or greater of diazepam equivalents.", 
    "38": "In order to identify EEG parameters that might be specific for identifying amnesia during midazolam infusion, we examined changes in the EEG power spectrum associated with a period of amnesia, determined by inability to recall a sequence of numbers and objects presented verbally, after intravenous midazolam 0.07 mg/kg in ten normal volunteers. Measurements were taken at baseline, during infusion immediately before and after the onset of amnesia, immediately at end of infusion, and 0.5 and 1.5 h after infusion. All subjects had onset of amnesia during infusion, were completely amnesic by the end of infusion, partially amnesic 0.5 h after infusion, and had complete recall by 1.5 h after infusion. The EEG beta power increased and alpha power decreased during amnesic periods. The beta 1/alpha power ratio was the parameter most specific for amnesia. From a baseline value of 0.20 +/- 0.05 (standard error of the mean [SEM]), it increased to 0.96 +/- 0.26 at the end of infusion and decreased to 0.61 +/- 0.15 0.5 h after infusion. By 1.5 h after infusion, all EEG parameters had returned to baseline values. Beta power changes associated with midazolam amnesia were most pronounced in the Fz and Cz lead positions, and alpha power changes were most pronounced in the Oz position. We conclude that 1) EEG power values, particularly the beta 1/alpha ratio, can identify periods of amnesia after midazolam infusion; 2) specific EEG changes and the presence of amnesia vary with the probable serum concentration of midazolam; and 3) the characteristic EEG pattern during partial or complete amnesia varies as one moves across the cerebral cortex.", 
    "39": "This article reviews some of the important aspects of benzodiazepine-induced disinhibitory reactions. Although reactions of this type are relatively rare, they may sometimes manifest themselves in aggressive behavior accompanied by suicidal or homicidal tendencies. It appears that these reactions occur more commonly in younger patients, although the elderly (above 65 years) may also be at risk. Many mechanisms have been postulated, but none truly explain how these reactions arise. The concept that central cholinergic mechanisms may play a role, however, remains attractive and stems primarily from physostigmine's ability to successfully reverse this type of reaction. The potential role of the benzodiazepine antagonists, eg, flumazenil, in reversing disinhibitory reactions is also discussed. Apart from patients who previously exhibited poor impulse control, there are no reliable indicators for recognizing potential candidates for this type of reaction. To minimize the occurrence of disinhibitory reactions, some guidelines, which include the avoidance of certain drug combinations, the use of low doses of benzodiazepines, slow incremental intravenous administration, and good rapport with patients, are presented.", 
    "40": "Patients who arrive home several hours after ambulatory surgery may drink alcohol. The extent to which the residual effects of drugs used in ambulatory surgery interact with alcohol, perhaps potentiating alcohol effects, is not known. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine whether intravenous midazolam had residual effects that would interact with alcohol consumed 4 h after the midazolam injection. Healthy male volunteers (n = 16) participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Subjects were studied four times successively with 1 wk between trials. On each test day the subjects randomly received by slow intravenous injection (30 s) either saline or 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam. Four hours after injection, the subjects consumed a beverage that either did or did not contain 0.7 g/kg of alcohol. Before and 1, 3, 5, and 7 h after injection (and before and 1 and 3 h after beverage consumption), psychomotor performance and mood were assessed. Whereas both midazolam and alcohol alone had effects on the dependent measures in this study, there were no significant interactions between the two drugs (i.e., potentiation of alcohol effects by midazolam or potentiation of midazolam by alcohol). We conclude that the effects of a short-acting benzodiazepine used in ambulatory surgery have probably dissipated by the time a patient arrives home, and that effects from alcohol ingested at home will probably not be influenced by the recent administration of a short-acting benzodiazepine such as midazolam.", 
    "41": "Fifty-three unpremedicated outpatients undergoing elective extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy using an unmodified Dornier HM-3 lithotriptor received one of two different intravenous sedation-analgesia techniques. Both intravenous midazolam-alfentanil and fentanyl-propofol techniques produced conditions comparable to those achieved with epidural anesthesia during immersion lithotripsy. Of the two sedative-analgesic techniques, midazolam-alfentanil was associated with greater intraoperative amnesia (81% vs 38%), whereas fentanyl-propofol produced less cardiorespiratory depression and fewer postoperative side effects (e.g., pruritus). Compared with a standard epidural anesthesia technique, the mean anesthesia and recovery times were significantly shorter with the two intravenous sedation-analgesia techniques (57-62 min vs 105 min and 143-147 min vs 199 min, respectively). These data suggest that combinations of either midazolam and alfentanil or fentanyl and propofol are viable alternatives to epidural anesthesia for outpatient immersion lithotripsy.", 
    "42": "To establish anesthesia with minimal respiratory and cardiovascular depression using propofol, the effects of varying the rate of delivery on anesthetic induction dose requirements and hemodynamic changes were studied in four groups of 20 patients each undergoing body surface surgery. All patients were premedicated with temazepam and received 1.5 micrograms/kg fentanyl 5 min before induction. Propofol was delivered at 50, 100, or 200 mg/min by the Ohmeda 9000 infusion pump (groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) or by bolus of 2 mg/kg (group 4) until loss of verbal contact. Anesthesia was maintained thereafter with propofol infused at 6 mg.kg-1.h-1. Using slower infusion rates, induction took significantly longer (124, 92, 62, and 32 s in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) and was achieved with significantly smaller doses of propofol (1.40, 1.96, 2.61, and 2.15 mg/kg in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Slow infusion (groups 1 and 2) caused less depression of systolic and diastolic blood pressure than rapid infusion (groups 3 and 4), but the differences were not statistically significant. Patients in groups 3 and 4 had significantly greater decreases in pulse rate and a greater incidence of apnea than did patients in group 1. There was no correlation between the size of the induction dose and subsequent maintenance requirements of propofol. The finding that the sleep dose of propofol is reduced at slower infusion rates has important practical and theoretical implications when considering the relative potencies of intravenous anesthetics.", 
    "43": "By means of the present study, we compare the variations in the cardiovascular response to the orotracheal intubation while using midazolam or etomidate during the anesthetic induction. For this purpose, we studied 2 groups of 10 patients each one which were premedicated with fentanyl and atropine, and succinylcholine as muscle relaxant. We took the data at a basal state, 10 minutes after premedication and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 minutes after the intubation handling. As hemodynamic data we registered heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the rate product (PRP). In both groups, the peak response occurred two minutes after intubation in all the studied parameters. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as PRP were significantly lower with midazolam. We conclude that midazolam and etomidate do not prevent the cardiovascular response to the intubation handling, although midazolam smooths pressure response.", 
    "44": "The anxiolytic action of clorazepate 15 mg PO on the eve and 1 hour before the surgical procedure was studied in 50 ASA class 1 patients (18-60 years old, 46-86 kg) scheduled for elective non-oncological surgery. Anxiety, assessed by the anaesthetist employing a modified Hamilton Anxiety Scale, was lower after premedication in 46 patients (p less than 0.01) and only few side-effects were noted. As a conclusion we suggested that clorazepate PO as anaesthetic premedication is suitable for anxiety relief.", 
    "45": "Clobazam was added to the previous antiepileptic drug therapy of 90 children suffering from drug resistant epilepsy. Ten patients became seizure free, although four of these later developed tolerance. Thirty-three patients experienced a decrease in seizure frequency, and 24 of these, too, developed tolerance. Forty-four patients showed no change in seizure frequency, and three experienced an increase. The best results were experienced by patients with myoclonic seizures, whereas patients with complex partial seizures usually developed tolerance. The concentrations of clobazam and its active metabolite norclobazam were measured in 251 serum and 57 saliva samples. The group of seizure-free patients had the lowest clobazam and norclobazam concentrations; tolerance was associated with the highest concentrations. Beneficial side effects were associated with low, and adverse effects with high, concentrations of norclobazam. The concentrations of clobazam and norclobazam in saliva correlated with concentrations in serum. Monitoring of serum and salivary concentrations of clobazam and norclobazam is of limited value only, and no therapeutic target range can be given.", 
    "46": "The receptor protein solubilized from synaptic membranes specifically binds [14C] NAD (dissociation constant--0.75 microM, capacity of binding sites--0.0125 nmol of metaid per 1 mg of protein). All the studied benzodiazepines (phenazepam, nitrazepam, clonazepam, flunitrazepam) are able to displace [14C] NAD from its receptor sites, the mixed type of inhibition being manifested. An inhibition constant for flunitrazepam, a ligand of benzodiazepine receptors, equals 10 microM. GABA promotes an inhibiting effect of benzodiazepines. It is supposed that neurotropic action of NAD is realized through the GABA-benzodiazepine complex of neuronal membranes.", 
    "47": "Variation pulsometry was used to study vegetative homeostasis changes over the course of induction anesthesia and tracheal intubation in children operated on for palatal clefts. The same premedication scheme was employed in all the patients. The same neuroleptic doses were administered in induction anesthesia. Induction anesthesia parallel with electroanalgesia with an Electronarcol-1 apparatus helped reduce the promedol dose necessary for adequate anesthesiologic protection from 1.2-1.4. to 0.2-0.4 mg/kg. This was associated with the minimal changes in autonomic nervous system functioning, evidencing the efficacy of electroanalgesia in induction anesthesia for this patient population.", 
    "48": "The drug discrimination paradigm (DD) was used to evaluate differences in performance of rats selectively bred for differential sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of ethanol. Tenth generation high-alcohol sensitive (HAS) and low-alcohol sensitive (LAS) rats were trained to discriminate between ethanol (1.0 g/kg, IP) and saline vehicle on a VR-5 schedule of reinforcement. The HAS strain was more sensitive to the discriminative effects of ethanol than the LAS strain, but the magnitude of difference was much smaller than the differential sleep-time differences. The biphasic action of ethanol was differentially seen when the LAS animals exhibited increased activity during both DD and spontaneous motor activity measures and the HAS exhibited decreased activity during DD only. Pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide but not chlorpromazine elicited the ethanol discriminative choice in both HAS and LAS strains. Response rates during DD indicated a dissociation of rate depressant effects and discriminative performance following ethanol. These findings are discussed in relationship to some current and future uses of selectively bred animal strains and DD for studying the effects of alcohol.", 
    "49": "By measuring levels of noradrenaline (NA) and its major metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4) in the hypothalamus, amygdala and locus coeruleus region, we investigated the effects of diazepam 5.0 mg/kg, morphine 6.0 mg/kg, or naloxone at 5.0 or 10 mg/kg injected SC immediately before stress exposure, on increases in NA release caused by psychological stress. Psychological stress, wherein rats were exposed to emotional responses which were displayed by other electrically shocked rats, significantly increased MHPG-SO4 levels in the three brain regions examined and elevated plasma corticosterone levels. Both increases in brain MHPG-SO4 levels and elevations of plasma corticosterone levels induced by stress were attenuated significantly by diazepam but neither by morphine nor by naloxone. MHPG-SO4 levels in the hypothalamus and amygdala in the morphine-stress group were significantly higher than those in the saline-stress group. These findings suggest that psychological stress, in which an emotional factor is predominantly involved, causes increases in NA release in these brain regions examined and that these increases are attenuated only by diazepam, in contrast to the previous report, where increases in brain NA release caused by immobilization stress are attenuated not only by diazepam but also by morphine and are enhanced by naloxone.", 
    "50": "In order to compare the potencies of bretazenil (Ro 16-6028) and midazolam (MDZ) to antagonize the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) cue, rats were trained to discriminate between 15 mg/kg IP PTZ and saline (FR10, food reinforced). Additionally, other rats were trained to discriminate between 1.0 mg/kg IP MDZ and saline in order to investigate the degree of generalization of bretazenil to MDZ, and to test for the antagonizing effects of PTZ. Both bretazenil and MDZ were able to block the PTZ cue. Bretazenil was about 60 times more potent than MDZ in this respect. In tests for response generalization, bretazenil substituted for MDZ cue. Bretazenil did not show MDZ-antagonist actions. PTZ did block the MDZ cue and the generalization of bretazenil in the MDZ-trained animals. Assuming that the drug discriminative stimulus functions of PTZ are closely related to its anxiogenic effects, it was concluded that bretazenil may possess powerful anxiolytic properties. Bretazenil did not suppress the response rates which is consistent with previous studies reporting a lack of sedative and muscle-relaxant effects of bretazenil.", 
    "51": "The influence of central vs. peripheral administration of specific type A and type B CCK receptor antagonists (L364,718 and L365,260, respectively) on colonic motor hyperactivity induced by feeding and CCK8 was investigated in dogs with strain-gauge transducers implanted on the proximal and transverse colon. Intravenous injection of L364,718 (5 and 10 micrograms/kg) reduced by 26.2% and 80.1%, respectively, the 0-4-h postprandial increase in colonic motor index; at similar doses L365,260 had no effect. Intracerebroventricular administration of L364,718, at a dose (1 microgram/kg) not active by the IV route, significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) by 67.5% the feeding-induced colonic hyperactivity. In contrast, L365,260 (1-10 micrograms/kg ICV) injected was inactive. Increase in colonic motility produced by intravenous CCK8 infusion (1 microgram/kg/h) was suppressed by previous ICV and IV administration of L364,718 at doses of 1 and 10 micrograms/kg, respectively, while L365,260 was inactive at similar doses. It is concluded that CCK8 released after a meal is responsible for the postprandial increase in colonic motility and that these effects may be mediated through activation of central CCKA receptors.",

It is a monotonous, unreactive and anteriorly predominant activity of less than 50 microV and of 8 to 13 Hz. Twenty cases of alpha coma are reported: 16 resulting from anoxic encephalopathy, 2 from brain stem strokes, and 2 from metabolic encephalopathy. Cardiac arrest was the main cause of alpha coma (10 cases); a large number of patients (7 cases) died, or have survived with severe neurologic deficits (2 cases). In 2 cases there was a metabolic-toxic cause (benzodiazepines and parathion intoxication). The 2 patients with pontomesencephalic haemorrhage died. The physiopathogenicity of alpha coma, which remains obscure, is also discussed.", 
    "53": "The effect of caloric restriction (CR) on the growth hormone (GH) response to compounds reportedly capable of acting via somatostatinergic influences, i.e. cholinergic agonist or antagonist drug, glucose or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), administered alone or combined with GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), was evaluated in dogs. Eight beagle dogs, aged 4-5 years, underwent a 26-day period of increasing CR; they were evaluated either under basal conditions or starting from day 13 of CR, according to a schedule which allowed the mean length of CR to be similar among individual tests. CR resulted in a significant increase in basal GH levels, and starting from day 13 in a significant decrease in plasma somatomedin C levels; plasma glucose levels were significantly diminished on day 13 of CR and then remained unaltered. Administration of GHRH (GHRH1-44, 2 micrograms/kg, i.v.) induced a rise in plasma GH levels strikingly higher during CR than under basal conditions. Pyridostigmine (2 mg/kg orally), a muscarinic cholinergic agonist reportedly capable of restraining hypothalamic release of somatostatin (SS), enhanced the GH response to GHRH under basal conditions, but failed to do so during CR. Conversely, pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg, i.v.), a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, abolished the GHRH-induced GH rise under basal conditions, but only reduced it during CR. Only by doubling the dose of pirenzepine was complete inhibition of the GHRH-induced GH rise effected. Glucose alone (2 g/kg, p.o.) failed to modify basal GH secretion either before or during CR, but significantly inhibited the GHRH-induced GH rise either before or during CR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Fourteen adult beavers (Castor canadensis) weighing 16.5 +/- 4.14 kg (mean +/- SD) were anesthetized for surgical implantation of radio telemetry devices. Beavers were anesthetized with diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine (25 mg/kg) administered IM, which provided smooth anesthetic induction and facilitated tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with halothane in oxygen via a semiclosed circle anesthetic circuit. Values for heart rate, respiratory rate, esophageal temperature, direct arterial blood pressure, end-tidal halothane concentration, and end-tidal CO2 tension were recorded every 15 minutes during the surgical procedure. Arterial blood samples were collected every 30 minutes to determine pH, PaO2, and PaCO2. Values for plasma bicarbonate, total CO2, and base excess were calculated. Ventilation was spontaneous in 7 beavers and controlled to maintain normocapnia (PaCO2 approx 40 mm of Hg) in 7 others. Vaporizer settings were adjusted to maintain a light surgical plane of anesthesia. Throughout the surgical procedure, all beavers had mean arterial pressure less than 60 mm of Hg and esophageal temperature less than 35 C. Mean values for arterial pH, end-tidal CO2, PaO2, and PaCO2 were significantly (P less than 0.05) different in spontaneously ventilating beavers, compared with those in which ventilation was controlled. Respiratory acidosis during halothane anesthesia was observed in spontaneously ventilating beavers, but not in beavers maintained with controlled ventilation. All beavers recovered unremarkably from anesthesia.", 
    "55": "Two ultralight general anesthetic techniques, one using low-dose ketamine and the other using methohexital as the primary anesthetic agent, were compared for efficacy, safety, and psychomotor recovery in a double-blind fashion for use during third molar surgery. Low-dose intravenous ketamine as the primary anesthetic following premedication with fentanyl and midazolam, and in conjunction with nitrous oxide, appeared to produce less hypoxia, hypercarbia, and apnea than when methohexital was used. No significant differences were noted in heart rate or blood pressure between the techniques. The ketamine technique was universally preferred by the surgeons and anesthesiologists because of superior patient cooperation and airway management. No unpleasant psychomimetic side effects of significance were noted with the use of ketamine. Postoperative recovery took slightly longer in the ketamine group, with patients being judged fit for discharge approximately 10 to 15 minutes later than the patients who received methohexital.", 
    "56": "Intravenous prolonged analgesia with analgin, diazepam and no-spa was used in the early postoperative period in 59 patients with acute surgical pathology of the abdominal cavity organs. The technique used ensured a marked analgetic effect. The combination of analgin, diazepam and no-spa, as compared to promedol, promoted to an earlier recovery of the respiration function, which was an effective measure preventing the onset of pulmonary complications.",

CSF-HA was determined by HPLC. CSF-HA was found to be increased after all premedications with great individual variation (range 0.07-7.4 pmol/ml). The highest values were found in the promethazine group (1.83 +/- 2.2 (SD) pmol/ml and the lowest in the control group (0.63 +/- 0.42 pmol/ml). Measurable concentrations of CSF-methylhistamine were found in 13 patients without correlation with HA. Postoperative need for analgesics was reduced in all premedicated groups. A significant correlation existed between HA and need for postoperative analgesics in the morphine plus scopolamine group. It is concluded that the histamine system plays a role in central nociception.",

The average daily doses of alprazolam and oxazepam were 1.48 mg and 44.4 mg, respectively. According to all rating scales applied, both alprazolam and oxazepam were effective in relieving anxiety associated with mild depression (p less than 0.01). Alprazolam proved somewhat more effective than oxazepam especially with regard to overall performance (p less than 0.05). Treatment-emergent adverse effects were few and mild for both compounds tested.", 
    "60": "Calculation of protective or therapeutic indices is widely used in primary and secondary screening for drugs with selective anticonvulsant activity. The protective index is the median minimal 'neurotoxic' dose, TD50, divided by median effective dose, ED50. TD50s are usually determined by tests, such as the rotarod test or the chimney test, for quantification of 'minimal neurological deficit', such as motor impairment, while median effective doses are commonly determined in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test or the s.c. pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure test in mice or rats. For antiepileptic drug development, it has been proposed previously that only compounds with an estimated protective index of at least 5 should proceed to further evaluation. However, various technical, biological and pharmacological factors can influence anticonvulsant or 'neurotoxic' potencies and thereby protective indices. In order to reevaluate the value of protective indexes in the prediction of drugs with selective anticonvulsant action, protective indices were determined for various clinically used antiepileptic drugs in standardized seizure tests, i.e. MES and s.c. PTZ tests in mice and rats, as well as in seizure threshold tests. For most drugs, similar TD50s were determined in the rotarod and chimney test. When protective indices were calculated for the different seizure models, only few drugs reached an index of 5 (some not even reaching an index of 2) in the traditional MES or s.c. PTZ tests in mice and rats. In contrast, using anticonvulsant doses determined by seizure threshold tests, the 5 primary drugs against generalized tonic-clonic seizures, i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and valproate, had indices of more than 5 in the MES threshold model, while drugs with efficacy against absence and myoclonic seizures, i.e., valproate, ethosuximide and the benzodiazepines, had protective indices of at least 5 in the i.v. PTZ seizure threshold model. The data substantiate that valuable information can be obtained by estimation of protective indices. However, in order to minimize the possibility that an interesting new anticonvulsant compound is overlooked during primary or secondary screening, a protective index of 2 should be considered sufficient in case of traditional MES or s.c. PTZ models with fixed seizure stimulus. Alternatively, seizure threshold models could be used for calculation of protective indices in order to avoid underestimation of anticonvulsant selectivity of test compounds.", 
    "61": "Comparative clinical studies of Chlormethiazole with a vast array of pharmacologically unrelated drugs like benzodiazepines, tiapride, bromocriptine, carbamazepine and phenothiazines over the years clearly established it as a useful, dependable and effective drug to treat patients with moderate to severe ethanol withdrawal syndrome, when used early in a flexible reducing regime tailed off over 7-10 days. It has been found to be highly effective in the treatment, and particularly in the prevention of DT's in high-risk patients, if given at an early stage. This paper critically reviews the important international clinical trial literature of various drugs currently used in the treatment of ethanol withdrawal syndrome, including DT's, it highlights the efficacy and superiority of Chlormethiazole over other drugs, and also discusses the probable mechanism of its actions in these conditions.", 
    "62": "A kinetic study of the acid hydrolysis of aqueous diazepam, bromazepam, and flunitrazepam was carried out at 25 degrees C using a spectrophotometric method. For diazepam and flunitrazepam, the experimental pseudo first-order rate constant decreased as the acid concentration was increased. The contrary behavior was found in the case of bromazepam. A kinetic scheme that includes the hydrolysis reaction of both protonated and nonprotonated species of the drug can account for these results. Also, the kinetics of the acid hydrolysis of the same drugs in the presence of micellar aggregates [nonionic polyoxyethylene-23-dodecanol (Brij 35); cationic cetyl trymethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB); and anionic sodium decyl (SdeS), dodecyl (SDS), and tetradecyl (STS) sulfate] was studied at 25 degrees C. Negligible effects were observed in the cases of nonionic and cationic micelles. Anionic micelles produced an inhibitory effect in the reaction velocity. This effect increased as the hydrophobic nature of the surfactant increased. All these facts are interpreted quantitatively by means of a pseudophase model.", 
    "63": "Patients with major depression admitted to hospital with acute stroke (n = 44), acute myocardial infarction (n = 25), or acute spinal cord injury (n = 12) were examined for differences in their phenomenological presentation of major depression. Depressed stroke patients were found to have significantly higher scores on the syndrome clusters for generalized anxiety and ideas of reference than depressed cardiac or spinal cord injury patients. In addition, significantly more stroke patients met diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder compared with the other two groups. Although spinal cord injury patients were younger, more likely to be treated with benzodiazepines, and less likely to be treated with beta-blockers, none of these factors distinguished stroke patients with anxious depression from stroke patients with depression only. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the etiology of depression following stroke may be different from that associated with myocardial infarction or spinal cord injury.",

Sleep behaviour during the first postoperative night was evaluated via a question sheet. The results show that changes in condition, known from the thalamonal discussion, e.g. increase of agitation, irritability, anxious depression -- also occur during the postoperative period.

    "83": "Use of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may inhibit the effects of benzodiazepines in a competitive manner. The only known partially agonistic effect of flumazenil is a weak anticonvulsive action at high doses. However, reports have claimed that flumazenil reduces the MAC of isoflurane in animal studies. Other reports have found that antagonizing midazolam-induced sedation or anesthesia by flumazenil led to an increase in respiratory depression. The aim of this study was to examine whether flumazenil i.v. increases fentanyl-induced respiratory depression. METHODS. In two separate sessions, ten healthy young volunteers were given either 0.0027 mg/kg fentanyl alone or 0.0027 mg/kg and 1 mg flumazenil i.v. over 4 min each time. The CO2 rebreathing method was used to determine the ventilatory response. RESULTS. Fentanyl alone brought about a significant reduction in CO2 response, characterized by a shift to the right and a decrease in the slope of the rebreathing curve (from 1.95 +/- 0.76 l.min-1.mmHg-1 to 0.86 +/- 0.53 l.min-1.mmHg-1). The infusion of additional flumazenil caused similarly significant respiratory depression (from 2.21 +/- 1.0 l.min-1.mmHg-1 to 0.77 +/- 0.38 l.min-1.mmHg-1). In both groups changes persisted for at least 120 min. No statistically significant differences between the two groups could be detected. CONCLUSION. Flumazenil does not enhance fentanyl-induced respiratory depression. Flumazenil's weak, partially agonistic action is therefore of no clinical importance.", 
    "84": "The effect of tandospirone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonist/anxiolytic, injected directly into dorsal hippocampus, on Vogel-type conflict behavior in rats was investigated and the findings were compared with the effects of diazepam and zopiclone. Tandospirone (30 micrograms/2 microliters and 60 micrograms/2 microliters) and diazepam (40 micrograms/2 microliters) but not zopiclone (20 micrograms/2 microliters), produced a potent anticonflict action in rats. The anticonflict action of tandospirone (30 micrograms/2 microliters), injected into the dorsal hippocampus, was significantly blocked by (-)-propranolol (5 mg/kg i.p.). The present findings provide evidence that suggests that tandospirone has an antianxiety action, presumably by stimulating 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal hippocampus.", 
    "85": "This essay considers the mechanisms which may mediate the apparent anxiolytic properties of nicotine and which are thought to be responsible for the 'calming' effect of tobacco smoke experienced by many smokers. It summarizes the evidence that, in many tests for anxiolytic activity, the effects of nicotine do not resemble those of established anxiolytic drugs such as diazepam and concludes that it is likely that neural systems other than those which mediate the responses to the benzodiazepines are responsible for the putative anxiolytic properties of nicotine. Circumstantial evidence which suggests that the increase in mesolimbic dopamine secretion evoked by nicotine may not only be rewarding per se but may also contribute to the ability of the drug to alleviate the effects of stress is presented. The essay also summarizes results which suggest that chronic nicotine evokes changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system which resemble those seen in animals treated chronically with antidepressant drugs and proposes that the mechanisms which mediate the ability of antidepressant drugs to alleviate the effects of stress may also mediate the apparent anxiolytic properties of nicotine. The possible consequences of this hypothesis for future research are considered.", 
    "86": "The thiamylal sparing effect of midazolam was studied in 30 healthy Beagle and mixed-breed dogs. Using a replicated Latin square design, all dogs were given placebo (saline solution) and 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg of midazolam/kg of body weight prior to IV administration of thiamylal sodium. The 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg dosages significantly decreased the amount of thiamylal required to obtund swallowing reflex and easily achieve endotracheal intubation. Midazolam at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg reduced thiamylal requirement by 16.4% and 18.9%, respectively, whereas the 0.05 mg/kg dosage decreased thiamylal requirement by only 6.8%. The 0.2 mg/kg dosage did not further decrease thiamylal requirement beyond that achieved with the 0.1 mg/kg dosage of midazolam. This study demonstrates that the preanesthetic IV administration of midazolam reduces the thiamylal dose necessary to accomplish intubation. The optimal preanesthetic dosage (lowest dosage with significant effect) was 0.1 mg/kg.", 
    "87": "Twenty one o-quinonoid-type compounds and one coumarin-type compound related to miltirone (1) have been synthesized with the aim to identify the key structural elements involved in miltirone's interaction with the central benzodiazepine receptor. On the basis of their inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to bovine cerebral cortex membranes, it is apparent that ring A of miltirone is essential for affinity. Although increasing the size of ring A from six-membered to seven- and eight-membered is well-tolerated, the introduction of polar hydroxyl groups greatly reduces binding affinity. The presence of 1,1-dimethyl groups on ring A is, however, not essential. On the other hand, the isopropyl group on ring C appears to be critical for binding as its removal decreases affinity by more than 30-fold. It can, however, be replaced with a methyl group with minimal reduction in affinity. Finally, linking ring A and B with a -CH2CH2- bridge results in analogue 89, which is 6 times more potent than miltirone at the central benzodiazepine receptor (IC50 = 0.05 microM).", 
    "88": "A cDNA from a rat hippocampal cDNA library encodes an isoform of the alpha polypeptide of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor. Its deduced amino acid sequence is 96% identical to that of the alpha 2 polypeptide of the bovine GABAA receptor. The polypeptide has features shared by all previously reported GABAA receptor alpha polypeptides and shares 71-76% identity with previously described rat alpha polypeptides. Most of the differences lie in the presumed extracellular and intracellular domains. On Northern blots, the alpha 2 cDNA detects two mRNAs, which are found in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, brain regions enriched in pharmacologically defined \"BZ type II\" receptors. Other workers have previously shown that the alpha polypeptides of the GABAA receptor largely determine the BZ binding properties of reconstituted receptors. The distribution of alpha 2 mRNAs in rat brain suggests that the alpha 2 subunit may indeed be involved in the BZ type II receptors.", 
    "89": "The reasons for women in Europe and North America being prescribed over twice as many psychotropic drugs as men are complex. Psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety appear to be more common in women than in men, and women more commonly complain of psychological symptoms. There may be a gender bias in medical diagnosis and choice of medication. Sociological factors may also be involved, including the likelihood that women have fewer outlets than men for symptom control by activities outside the home (e.g. the social use of alcohol). Women also have special problems including pregnancy, lactation, child rearing and pre-menstrual tension. Probably, much use of psychotropic-drug use for women (and men) is inappropriate and not closely related to the symptoms or conditions for which they are prescribed. Furthermore, the chronic use of some psychotropic drugs, especially benzodiazepines, may compound the problem by inducing dependence and withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "90": "The relationship between gastrin-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) content and [14C]aminopyrine ([14C]AP) uptake (an index of in vitro acid secretion) was investigated in a population of highly enriched rabbit parietal cells (90 +/- 5%). Gastrin induced a rapid rise in Ins(1,4,5)P3 content which was maximal within 15 s of stimulation (2- to 2.5-fold basal level) followed by a rapid decrease within 30 s; a high Ins(1,4,5)P3 level could also be observed after a longer time of hormone stimulation (180 s). Gastrin dose-dependently induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation and [14C]AP uptake; both dose-response curves were similar (EC50 approximately 0.1 nM). Furthermore, L-365,260 (3-(acylamino)benzodiazepine), a selective gastrin/CCK-B receptor antagonist, dose-dependently inhibited Ins(1,4,5)P3 production and [14C]AP accumulation induced by 10 nM gastrin with a similar potency (IC50 approximately 1-2 nM). These results led us to conclude that Ins(1,4,5)P3 is involved in gastrin-stimulated acid secretory activity of gastric parietal cells.", 
    "91": "Stress is associated with alterations in GABA/benzodiazepine binding and function. We evaluated effects of social stress on GABAA receptor subunit (alpha 1 and gamma 2) mRNAs by Northern hybridization.

These changes persisted for 72 hours after stress, and returned to baseline levels at 7 days. No changes in mRNAs were observed in sham-treated mice. No changes in either subunit mRNA were observed in stressed or sham-treated mice in cerebellum or hippocampus. In undefeated resident mice, mRNAs for both subunits in cortex were unaffected at 24 hours after the stress episode. Social stress is associated with increases in GABAA receptor alpha 1 and gamma 2 subunit mRNAs in cortex.", 
    "92": "The cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8)-derived synthetic peptides Boc-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-Gly-DTrp-Nle-Asp-O-CH2-CH2-C6H5 (JMV179) and Boc-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-Gly-DTrp-Nle-Asp-NH-CH2-CH2-C6H5 (JMV167) are antagonists of peripheral cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in vitro. In the present study, antagonist activity of these peptides was studied on rat pancreatic secretion in vivo, and compared to those of other peptidic molecules and to the non-peptidic antagonists L364718, D-, L-, DL-lorglumide, and proglumide. The decreasing order of antagonist potencies on amylase release in vitro was L364718 greater than JMV179 greater than lorglumide greater than JMV167 greater than proglumide; JMV179 was 25 times less potent than L364718 and 300 times more potent than JMV167. The decreasing order of antagonist potencies on protein output in pancreatic juice in vivo was L364718 greater than JMV167 greater than JMV179 greater than lorglumide greater than proglumide; JMV167 was two times more potent than JMV179 and only 8 times less potent than L364718. Increased potency of JMV167, relative to JMV179 under in vivo conditions, is probably due to the slower rate of catabolism of the phenylethylamide group, relative to the phenylethylester group, since the metabolite issued from hydrolysis of the ester bond was totally inactive. This study shows that it is possible to obtain peptidic CCK antagonists, which are active and potent in vivo, and provides a quantitative measurement of potency changes occurring in vivo for several peptidic and non-peptidic antagonists.",

The ionic current evoked by muscarinic receptor agonists was investigated in dispersed chromaffin cells of the guinea-pig adrenal medulla using the whole-cell version of the patch-clamp procedure. 2. Muscarine or oxotremorine (0.03-10 microns) produced an inward current associated with an increase in current noise at a holding potential of -40 mV. The relationship between current and oxotremorine concentration fitted well to a rectangular hyperbole with an apparent dissociation constant (KA) of 0.23 micron. 3. The muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine (0.1 micronM) and AF-DX 116 (0.3 microM) shifted the dose-response curve to the right in a parallel manner. Dissociation constants (KB) for pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 were estimated to be 50 and 70 nM, respectively. 4. The current-voltage relation for the current induced by muscarine had a negative slope below -30 or -20 mV, and the current reversed its polarity at 0.4 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 4) in standard salt solution. Removal of Mg2+ or Ca2+ from the perfusate did not modify the muscarinic current-voltage relationship. 5. When Na+ in the bath solution was replaced with Tris, the muscarinic current-voltage relationship shifted to the left (the hyperpolarizing direction); the current reversed its polarity at -18.7 +/- 1.2 mV in a solution containing 72 mM-Na+ (three cells) and at -57.5 +/- 2.7 mV in nominally Na(+)-free solution (three cells). When Ca2+ was replaced by Mg2+, in Na(+)-free solution, an inward current was not evoked by muscarinic stimulation. 6. Tetraethylammonium (TEA; 0.03-3 mM) reduced the muscarinic current at -40 mV, and the KD value was 0.34 mM with a Hill coefficient of 1. Barium (4 mM) reduced the current to 0.69 +/- 0.06 of control (n = 3). 7. When the recording electrodes contained guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiophosphate) (GTP gamma S, 100 microM), an inward current developed at -55 mV during the first few minutes after breaking into the cell interior. This inward current was associated with an increase in noise and was not larger at -70 mV than at -55 mV; it reached a peak value about 3-4 min after breaking into the cell interior and then declined over the next 2-3 min. 8. Muscarinic agonists had no effect in those cells in which intracellular GTP gamma S had first evoked a transient inward current. The inward current caused by nicotine was unaffected by intracellular GTP gamma S.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "94": "Diazepam 5 mg or an inert placebo tablet was given as preoperative hypnotic on the night before operation to two groups (n = 18 in each) of healthy women having elective Caesarean section under spinal analgesia. A third group (n = 18) received no hypnotic. The quality of the preoperative night's sleep assessed subjectively was significantly better in the diazepam-treated patients compared with those receiving no drug. The diazepam-treated patients had also smaller CSF concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and of the dopamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). In comparison with the two other patient groups, in the diazepam group there was no correlation between demographic, physiological or subjectively estimated variables and CSF or plasma measurements of monoamine transmitters and their metabolites. Preoperative fear and apprehension correlated most strongly with preoperative heart rate and with the increase in heart rate from the previous day.

    "95": "Perioperative hemodilution (HD) has become an accepted means of reducing transfusion requirements. Therefore, the effects of limited (decrease in hematocrit [Hct] from 30 to 20%, \"HD1\") and severe (decrease in Hct from 20 to 14%, \"HD2\") acute normovolemic HD with 6% hydroxyethyl starch on splanchnic blood flows (electromagnetic flow probes), O2 uptakes and deliveries, surface O2 tensions (PO2) (Clark-type electrode), hepatic metabolism (organic acids), and hepatic histology (liver biopsies) were studied in nine pigs anesthetized and paralyzed with ketamine/flunitrazepam and pancuronium. HD1 caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in cardiac output and all splanchnic flows. Only hepatic arterial blood flow increased twice as much as did cardiac output. Except for hepatic arterial O2 delivery, all splanchnic O2 deliveries decreased. Splanchnic O2 extractions increased, and O2 uptakes remained unchanged. There were no changes in mean surface PO2 values or in surface PO2 histograms of liver and small intestine; in portal or hepatic venous pH; and in hepatic uptake of pyruvate and lactate. In contrast, during HD2 (despite further increases in flows and O2 extractions) portal and hepatic venous pH decreased; mean surface PO2 of liver and small intestine decreased; and the liver surface PO2 histogram showed broadening and a shift to the left. However, hepatic uptake of lactate and pyruvate, and splanchnic O2 uptake remained unchanged, and histologic examination did not reveal significant cell injury. These data indicate that in this experimental model limited acute normovolemic HD was well tolerated by the splanchnic organs. After severe HD, gross liver function remained intact, but there was evidence that compensatory mechanisms (increases in flow and O2 extractions) were no longer fully able to counteract the decrease in splanchnic O2 delivery.", 
    "96": "This paper presents examples of the application of ethopharmacology to the study of aggression. Low doses of benzodiazepines may increase aggression under appropriate conditions. In various animal models in male and female rats and mice the aggression enhancing effects are particularly marked when aggression is inhibited by internal or external events. It is therefore suggested that benzodiazepines have no direct effect on aggression, but modulate inhibitory factors which regulate aggression.", 
    "97": "This overview deals first with the actual views on the neurobiology of anxiety, focusing on the limbic system and epileptiform neuronal activities. No single neurotransmitter system is likely to be involved exclusively in prevention or generation of anxiety and, hence, to be a target for drugs affecting anxiety specifically. Next, animal tests currently used to identify drugs effective in the treatment of anxiety, in particular specific forms of anxiety, are discussed. Drugs currently used in the treatment of anxiety as well as anxiogenic agents and their mechanisms of action are compared. The future development in the field of anxiety-reducing drugs is seen in partial agonists of benzodiazepine receptors. Specific ligands of the various 5-HT receptors may replace benzodiazepine receptor ligands in specific forms of anxiety disorders, but do not seem to represent general alternatives, in particular, when an immediate attenuation of anxiety is required.", 
    "98": "We report here our findings on music perception obtained as a companion study to the investigation with 16-channel EEG mapping in psychiatric patients during motor activation, published recently elsewhere. We decided to add on a study of this functional circuit, since there is evidence that it is disturbed in various psychiatric patient groups (another \"functio laesa\"). Involved in the study were 23 male and 25 female schizophrenics, 11 male and 18 female non-endogenously depressed patients (not presently under medication, i.e. drug-naive or wash-out period from 1 week to 17 years), 26 male and 37 female endogenously depressed patients (medicated with tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines; no lithium), and 22 male and 17 female control subjects (i.e. n = 179). We compared resting conditions after a special relaxation procedure with three music perception tasks: (1) a standardised rumba rhythm generated by a keyboard and delivered binaurally by earphones, (2) the same as an arpeggio in D major, and (3) the same as an arpeggio with a tonic-subdominant-dominant cadence. Major results were obtained in the delta and alpha frequency bands, yielding signs of \"diffuse hyperactivation\", most prominent in schizophrenic males, and not observed to a similar extent in any other patient group or in normal controls. Interestingly, there were major sex differences, yielding a more diffuse EEG activation pattern in normal females than in males and thus possibly obscuring signs of brain function diffusion in female patients. Viewing our broader evidence of similar brain dysfunction when examining motor functional circuits, especially in schizophrenics, these findings provide further evidence of a brain disorganization with lack of laterality/diffusion which may be found in subgroups of these patients and not in other psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenic patients, these EEG signs of \"diffuse hyperactivation\" on simple motor and/or music stimulation were reduced to nearly normal by neuroleptic medication. The latter finding may contribute to possible clinical applications of EEG mapping, considering the EEG's unique suitability for long-term brain function monitoring. Other neuroimaging methods like SPECT and PET should be used for additional \"external validation\".", 
    "99": "The effects of tandospirone, a novel 5-HT1A receptor-related anxiolytic, on pressor responses elicited by activation of the posterior hypothalamus were examined in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats and compared with those of diazepam and tofisopam. Intravenous administration of tandospirone (0.1-1 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the pressor responses to stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus, but did not inhibit the pressor responses to intravenous norepinephrine. The inhibition of the posterior hypothalamus-induced pressor response by tandospirone was significantly antagonized by pindolol (a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist) but not by CGS-8216 (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), while the latter reduced the inhibitory effects of diazepam. Tofisopam (a 2,3-benzodiazepine which lacks affinity for benzodiazepine receptors) only attenuated the posterior hypothalamus-induced pressor responses at a high dose (10 mg/kg), which was sufficient to suppress the norepinephrine-induced pressor responses. These results indicate that tandospirone, diazepam and tofisopam all inhibit the pressor response to the posterior hypothalamus activation. In addition, tandospirone and diazepam exert this effect through different mechanisms, the former probably through 5-HT1A receptors and the latter through benzodiazepine receptors.",

Since all reports concern inbred strains, we studied two outbred Wistar strains which are used routinely in several research disciplines. The pharmacodynamics of desmethyldiazepam (DMD), the main active metabolite of diazepam in man, were compared for male rats of the Riv:TOX strain (from the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection) and the Crl:(WI)BR strain. The duration of sedative action of DMD after oral administration, as derived from suppression of the nocturnal locomotor activity, was longer in the Riv:TOX strain than in the Crl:(WI)BR strain. Accordingly, suppression of novelty-induced corticosterone release as an index of anxiolytic action was observed 11 hours after DMD administration in Riv:TOX rats but not in Crl:(WI)BR rats. At that time, serum DMD concentration was shown to be higher in the Riv:TOX strain than in the Crl:(WI)BR strain. The data are discussed in relation with possible metabolic differences between the two strains."
