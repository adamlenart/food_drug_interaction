We describe the cases of two patients who developed myoclonus within 24 hours of hypoxic respiratory and cardiac arrest. Initially, the clonic movements were thought to be generalised convulsions and were treated as such, until it became evident that the patients were aware and distressed. Posthypoxic myoclonus is a rare complication of successful cardiopulmonary resusitation. Recognition depends on the awareness that the syndrome exists, and is important so that correct therapy can be instituted. There may be important prognostic implications. Both our patients had normal intellectual recovery with moderate residual neurological disability from their movement disorder.", 
    "1": "Insulin has recently been shown experimentally to modify ischemic brain damage when administered either before or after the episode of ischemia. In controlled studies in the rat, high doses of insulin (greater than or equal to 8 IU/kg) result in seizures and early death. The present study was undertaken to determine whether diazepam, a potent, centrally penetrating GABAmimetic, alone or in combination with insulin, could mitigate postischemic seizures or regional selective neuronal necrosis and infarction. Forebrain ischemia was induced in rats for 10 1/2 minutes by carotid clamping and hypotension. The animals were observed clinically until elective perfusion-fixation and quantitative pathologic examination at 1-week recovery. Diazepam, either alone or with insulin, reduced regional brain necrosis and reduced the seizure rate. Insulin alone also led to reduced regional necrosis. However, the combination of diazepam plus insulin yielded the greatest proportion of undamaged brains in the hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain. In the neocortex, the diazepam-only group showed the greatest number of normal hemispheres. Hypothalamic infarction was eliminated by all three treatments. Seizures per se were associated with increased damage in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, irrespective of treatment group. The findings indicate that ischemic brain necrosis can be mitigated by diazepam and insulin treatment begun in the immediate postischemic period.", 
    "2": "Radioligand binding and quantitative autoradiographic techniques were used to characterize the pharmacological profile and anatomical distribution of N-[3H]methylscopolamine [( 3H] NMS)-labeled sites under assay conditions in which radioligand binding to M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors was blocked by addition of pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 (11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) to the incubation buffer. Nonlinear regression analysis of saturation data demonstrated that a large proportion of atropine-displaceable [3H]NMS binding persisted in the presence of saturating concentrations of M1 and M2 blockers. The residual [3H]NMS [( 3H]NMSb) sites were widely distributed throughout rat brain and represented the predominant muscarinic receptor population. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]NMSb sites did not correspond to that of [3H]pirenzepine or [3H]AF-DX 116, indicating that [3H]NMSb labeled non-M1, non-M2 muscarinic sites. Moreover, the pharmacological profile of [3H]NMSb differed from that of [3H]pirenzepine at M1 sites, and was inconsistent with that of M2 receptor binding sites. Although we were unable to pharmacologically distinguish subpopulations of non-M1, non-M2 binding sites, the anatomical distribution of [3H]NMSb sites corresponded to that of the combined mRNA distributions for m3 and m4.", 
    "3": "Patients with panic disorder (N = 1168) were enrolled in a multicenter, 8-week, double-blind clinical trial of imipramine, alprazolam, and placebo to analyze whether the effectiveness of these agents is dependent on the depressive/dysphoric symptomatology which often coexists in panic disorder patients. In addition to analyses performed on the whole sample of patients, the authors conducted analyses on a subsample (N = 312) defined by multiple criteria to ensure the absence of depression and dysphoria. In both the overall sample and the nondepressed subsample, the clinical response to imipramine or alprazolam was found to be independent of the presence of depression or dysphoria. In panic disorder patients for whom pharmacotherapy is being considered as treatment, the absence of depression is apparently not a contraindication.", 
    "4": "A series of [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-alpha][1,4]benzodiazepines bearing an ethynyl functionality at the 8-position and the isosteric thieno[3,2-f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-alpha][1,4]diazepines were prepared and evaluated as antagonists of platelet activating factor. The effects of substitution were explored in in vitro and in vivo test systems designed to measured PAF-antagonistic activity. Results are discussed and compared with previously published data. Many of the compounds had activity superior to WEB 2086, compound 1. In general, the thieno analogues exhibited better oral activity than the corresponding benzodiazepines. The duration of activity upon oral administration was modulated by the substitution on the acetylenic side chain. Compounds 71 and 81 were selected for further pharmacological evaluation as a result of their good oral potency and exceptionally long duration of action.", 
    "5": "In a prospective, double-blind comparison, we assessed the efficacy of transdermal clonidine with that of chlordiazepoxide in the treatment of moderately severe acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. While having significant withdrawal symptoms, 50 hospitalized men were randomly assigned to receive either transdermal clonidine or chlordiazepoxide over a 4-day study period. Outcome was evaluated daily, medically and psychiatrically, using both objective and subjective measurements for dependent variables. No patient in either study group had seizures or progression to delirium tremens. The group receiving transdermal clonidine had a more significant response globally for the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, as measured by the Alcohol Withdrawal Assessment Scale. Also, clonidine more effectively lowered elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. The core target symptom, anxiety, decreased significantly more in the patients receiving transdermal clonidine when measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and its subscale for somatic anxiety. Cognitive function responded equally in both study populations. Clonidine-treated patients reported less diarrhea, dizziness, headache and fatigue, and the chlordiazepoxide-treated patients reported less nausea and vomiting. We conclude that transdermal clonidine is effective treatment for the acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "6": "PK 11195 is a selective and specific ligand for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site. Its potential for in vivo visualisation of lesioned human brain using positron emission tomography (PET) is currently being assessed. The present study examines the relationship between the temporal development of a local ischaemic lesion with its associated cell populations and the binding of [3H]PK 11195 in rat brain. Unilateral cortical infarcts were induced using the photosensitive dye Rose Bengal. At time intervals from 1 to 7 days after lesioning, the localisation of [3H]PK 11195 binding was determined using in vivo and in vitro autoradiography. Sections adjacent to those used for autoradiography were processed for immunohistochemistry using glial fibrillary acidic protein for astrocytes and ED-1 for macrophages. The results show that the binding of [3H]PK 11195 correlates in both time and spatial localisation with the appearance of macrophages around the lesion. Reactive astrocytes, although present, occupy a separate region in the tissue surrounding the lesion and lie outside the region defined by the [3H]PK 11195 binding. We conclude that the [3H]PK 11195 signal associated with this ischaemic lesion originates primarily from binding to macrophages and that [11C]PK 11195 could be used for imaging acute inflammatory response in human brain using PET.", 
    "7": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and advantages or disadvantages, if any, of patient-controlled sedation compared with sedation administered by the anesthesiologist during surgical epidural anesthesia. Forty patients were divided at random into two groups with 20 patients in each group. Patients in group 1 received 0.5-1.0 mg intravenous midazolam and 25-50 micrograms intravenous fentanyl in increments administered by the anesthesiologist to achieve intraoperative sedation; patients in group 2 self-administered a mixture of midazolam (0.5 mg) and fentanyl (25 micrograms) in increments using an Abbott Lifecare PCA infuser to achieve sedation. Demographics of the patients, the types of surgery performed, doses of midazolam and fentanyl administered in a given period of time, and the level of sedation maintained during epidural anesthesia and surgery were similar in both groups. Patients in the self-administered group, however, rated their level of comfort during anesthesia and surgery higher than did those in the anesthesiologist-controlled sedation group. This could have been due to a positive psychological effect produced by allowing patient to feel that they have some control over their situation. The findings of this study indicate that patient-controlled sedation using a combination of midazolam and fentanyl is a safe and effective technique that provides intraoperative sedation ranked better by patients than that provided by anesthesiologists using the same drugs. More studies are, however, needed to determine the best choice of drug(s), the doses, the lock-out intervals, and the possible use of continuous infusion with patient-controlled sedation.", 
    "8": "The effects of various cholecystokinin (CCK)-related peptides were investigated on 35 mM K(+)-stimulated endogenous dopamine release from slices of either anterior or posterior nucleus accumbens of the rat. CCK sulphated octapeptide (1-10 microM), but not pentagastrin or CCK unsulphated octapeptide, was found to cause a dose-dependent increase in the release from the posterior nucleus accumbens. This effect was blocked by low doses of the CCKA receptor antagonist L364,718 (10 nM) but not the CCKB receptor antagonist L365,260. In the anterior nucleus accumbens CCK sulphated octapeptide (1 microM) and CCK unsulphated octapeptide (0.1-1 microM) inhibited the dopamine release, and this effect was blocked by L365,260 (10-100 nM) but not by L364,718. These results suggest that CCK has a different effect on dopamine release from the anterior and posterior nucleus accumbens and that these effects are mediated by two different types of CCK receptor.", 
    "9": "The effect of the anxiogenic beta-carboline methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxyamide (FG 7142) on dopamine release in prefrontal cortex and striatum in the awake freely moving rat was determined using the technique of microdialysis. FG 7142 (25 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a time-dependent increase in dopamine release in prefrontal cortex which was statistically significantly greater than the response to vehicle administration. Dopamine release in striatum was unaltered by FG 7142. Pretreatment of animals with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (30 mg/kg, i.p., 15 min prior to FG 7142 administration) completely abolished the increase in dopamine release caused by FG 7142 in prefrontal cortex. These data indicate that the anxiogenic benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 can selectively increase dopamine release in prefrontal cortex, and that this effect appears to be mediated via the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "10": "Anesthesia was induced in 14 greyhounds with a mixture of diazepam or midazolam (0.28 mg/kg) and ketamine (5.5 mg/kg), and maintained with halothane. There were no significant differences in weight, age, or duration of anesthesia between the treatment groups. Time to intubation with diazepam-ketamine (4.07 +/- 1.43 min) was significantly longer than with midazolam-ketamine (2.73 +/- 0.84 min). Heart rate, respiratory rate, PaCO2, and arterial pH did not vary significantly during anesthesia in either treatment group. Arterial blood pressures, PaO2, halothane vaporizer setting, and body temperature changed significantly from baseline values in both treatment groups during anesthesia. Times to sternal recumbency and times to standing were not significantly different. These data suggest that both diazepam-ketamine and midazolam-ketamine are useful anesthetic combinations in greyhounds. In combination with ketamine, midazolam offers little advantage over diazepam.", 
    "11": "Three boys with hemimegalencephaly are reported. Two suffered neonatal convulsions and the third presented with seizures at seven months. In each case the EEG was grossly abnormal, with spike and wave activity. All three have significant developmental delay and demonstrate other manifestations of the condition: macrocephaly in two, contralateral hemiparesis in one and one boy has ipsilateral facial hemihypertrophy and linear naevus. Hemimegalencephaly can be recognised on cranial ultrasonography, and the seizures may respond to benzodiazepine therapy.", 
    "12": "The data suggest that the 4MU-UDPGT activity of human liver microsomes probably contributes to the glucuronidation of a limited number of clinically used drugs. However, confirmation of this ultimately requires studies to be performed with purified isozymes, cDNAs expressed in cell culture, or specific inhibitory antibodies.", 
    "13": "Systemic (s.c.) administration of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) in mice triggered clonic convulsions with a CD50 (convulsive dose) of 68 mg/kg (range 54-86). AOAA also induced clonic convulsions in mice subjected to intracerebroventricular administration of the drug with a CD50 of 0.04 mumols (range 0.028-0.06). At the onset of convulsions induced by systemic AOAA (CD97;150 mg/kg), the GAD activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was not affected. GABA mimetic drugs, progabide and gabaculine, had no effect on convulsions induced by AOAA. Convulsions induced by systemic administration of AOAA were blocked by diazepam, phenobarbital, and valproate. Ethosuximide, trimethadione, acetazolamide, diphenylhydantoin, and carbamazepine remained ineffective. L-Phenylisopropyladenosine was also found to protect mice against AOAA-induced convulsions, whereas atropine and baclofen had no effect. The seizures induced by intracerebroventricular administration of AOAA (CD97; 0.1 mumols) were blocked by coadministration of preferential N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, D-(-)-2-aminophosphonoheptanoic (AP7), 3-[+/-)-2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic (CPP), and kynurenic acid (KYNA); preferential quisqualate/kainate antagonists, 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione and gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulphonic acid, remained inactive in the range of dosages sufficient to block seizures induced by quisqualic acid or kainic acid. The antagonistic action of antiepileptic drugs effective against seizures induced by excitatory amino acids (diazepam and valproate), and drugs acting on excitatory amino acid receptors (AP7, CPP, and KYNA) upon seizures induced by AOAA suggests an involvement of excitatory neurotransmission in the convulsant action of the drug.", 
    "14": "Effects of restraint stress (24 hr at room temperature) were evaluated on some immunological, visceral and endocrinal responses in rats. In animals sensitized with sheep RBC (SRBC), restraint stress (a) prevented the booster-induced rise in anti-SRBC antibody titre, (b) induced gastric mucosal erosions, and (c) elevated plasma corticosterone, when compared to non-stressed controls. Diazepam (1 or 10 mg/kg) consistently attenuated the effects of stress on all three parameters studied. The opioid antagonist, naltrexone (1 or 5 mg/kg) tended to aggravate these stress-induced effects. These concurrent biological changes during stress and their modulation by drugs are discussed in light of a possible correlation between endocrinal, immunological and visceral changes during such aversive stimuli.", 
    "15": "In this study, the effects of midazolam (M), diazepam (D) and thiopentone (T) on respiratory and cardiovascular systems were compared. The patients were randomly divided into 6 groups, besides minute ventilatory volume (MV), onset of induction and cardiovascular changes were also observed. Induction was performed by a bolus injection of one of the following: midazolam (0.3 mg/kg), diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) or thiopentone (5 mg/kg). Five minutes later, 5 micrograms/kg fentanyl and 1.5-2.0 mg/kg succinylcholine were administered. The results showed that: (1) Inhibitory effect on MV was not prominent and similar after use of midazolam and diazepam but was remarkable after thiopental; (2) As for the onset, midazolam was faster than diazepam but slower than thiopentone; (3) Hemodynamic changes of midazolam, diazepam and thiopentone were similar, however during intubation, cardiovascular response was the least in midazolam, diazepam the intermediate and thiopentone the most significant. We conclude that midazolam is a water-soluble, safe and effective inductive anesthetic with its short eliminated half-life period, and much lesser venous irritation, and it is certainly superior to both diazepam and thiopentone.", 
    "16": "On the basis of the hypothetical utility of clonazepam (CLN) for the treatment of affective disorders, by means of previous references and etiopathogenic hypothesis like the Kindling phenomenon we have been developing a study in order to evaluate that usefulness and efficacy which, includes 32 patients with affective disorders; 23 of them with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (manic) the greatest part of the subjects had been previously treated with lithium antidepressants or neuroleptics, and clonazepam was introduced because of an inadequate response, treatment intolerance or searching for a specific effect. Our results suggest a prevalence of partial and good responses (85%) The same in the objective evaluations as in the subjective ones being the levels of response higher than in previous treatments. The study supports the use of CLN in the treatment of patients who suffer from affective disorders, particularly in hypomanic episodes.", 
    "17": "Behavioral effects of propentofylline and N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (PIA) were evaluated by operant behavior under a punishment situation, discrete shuttle avoidance response and ambulatory activity in mice. Propentofylline (3 mg/kg, s.c.) and PIA (0.01 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly decreased the punished response without producing a significant change in the non-punished response. Propentofylline and PIA reduced the increase in the punished response induced by caffeine (30 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg). Propentofylline and PIA also reduced the increase of ambulation induced by caffeine. Furthermore, the single administration of propentofylline and PIA decreased the response rate and/or % avoidance in the discrete shuttle avoidance situation. However, the effective doses of propentofylline and PIA to reduce the ambulation-increasing effect of caffeine and to produce a change in the avoidance behavior were much higher than those effective for eliciting a significant change in the punished response. The present results suggest that there is an intimate interaction between central adenosine and benzodiazepine systems with regards to the change of punished response.", 
    "18": "Experimental and clinical study of the analgesic effects of mebicar and benzodiazepine series tranquilizers (sibazon and chlozepid) and their combinations with non-narcotic analgesics (amidopyrin, pyranal) or local anesthetic lidocaine has demonstrated a more marked effect of benzodiazepine derivatives on pain sensitivity thresholds as against mebicar. Tranquilizer combinations with other analgesics helped define the optimal premedication variants: benzodiazepine derivative augment analgesic activity whereas mebicar potentiates lidocaine effect.", 
    "19": "The effect of propofol, a novel short acting anaesthetic, on the function of the GABAA/ionophore receptor complex was studied in vitro in cortical membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex and was compared with the action of pentobarbital and alphaxalone, two general anaesthetics known to enhance GABAergic transmission. Propofol, mimicking the action of pentobarbital and alphaxalone, increased [3H]GABA binding, reduced [35S]TBPS binding and enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. While the efficacy of the drugs in affecting these biochemical parameters was similar, they differed markedly in potency being alphaxalone greater than propofol greater than pentobarbital. However, separate sites of action or different mechanisms for these drugs can be suggested by the result that the concomitant addition of propofol either with alphaxalone or pentobarbital or diazepam produced a simple additive inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding as well as an additive enhancement of [3H]GABA binding and muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. The effect of propofol at the level of the GABA/ionophore receptor complex seems to be strictly dependent on the interaction of GABA with its recognition site. In fact, the specific GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline antagonized the decrease of [35S]TBPS binding as well as the enhancement of [3H]GABA binding and muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake induced by propofol. On the other hand, propofol was able to enhance [3H]GABA binding in membranes previously incubated with the specific chloride channel blocker picrotoxin. Finally, the finding that propofol fails to affect [3H]flunitrazepam binding together with the failure of Ro 15-1788 and PK 11195 to antagonize its effect on [35S]TBPS binding excludes a direct interaction at the level of benzodiazepine recognition sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "We have explored the functional significance of various drug-induced changes in t-[35S]butylbycyclophosporothionate (TBPS) binding to gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors by comparing them with the actions of the drugs on GABA-induced 36Cl- uptake in rat cerebrocortical membrane preparations. In the presence of micromolar concentrations of GABA, various benzodiazepine receptor agonists, 3 alpha-21-dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one, and pentobarbital inhibited [35S]TBPS binding, whereas ethyl-beta-carboline-3carboxylate (beta-CCE), an inverse agonist, stimulated it, in general agreement with earlier reports [Mol. Pharmacol. 23:326-336 (1983); Mol. Pharmacol. 30:218-225 (1986)]. The drug-induced changes in [35S]TBPS binding, after normalization with respect to the corresponding action of diazepam, were closely related to the relative ability of the drugs to affect 36Cl- uptake, with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and a slope of 0.85. Upon abolishment of GABA action by the use of bicuculline, however, all the tested drugs stimulated [35S]TBPS binding to various degrees, and their relative changes displayed a lower correlation coefficient of 0.69, with a slope of 2. In particular, the effects of the anesthetic steroid and pentobarbital on [35S]TBPS binding were markedly altered by GABA, which at 2 microM increased not only their maximal effects, but also their half-maximal concentrations severalfold. On the other hand, GABA did not significantly affect these parameters for diazepam under our experimental conditions. Also, the GABA-independent changes in [35S]TBPS binding produced by various benzodiazepine receptor agonists matched reasonably well the actions of the drugs on 36Cl- uptake, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and a slope of 1.0. These data suggest more pronounced functional coupling of the GABA sites with those for the steroid and the barbiturate, as compared with the benzodiazepine site. It appears that the degree of [35S]TBPS binding in the presence of GABA closely reflects the functional state of GABAA receptors and may be useful for characterization of allosteric interactions between various sites on the receptors.", 
    "21": "We have characterized the pharmacologic properties of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptor complex in hippocampal membranes from 3-month- and 24-month-old Wistar rats. No major changes were found in [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]muscimol binding parameters. Neither the dissociation constant(s) nor the Bmax for either ligand seemed to be modified during aging in hippocampus. Furthermore, the allosteric interaction between the barbiturates binding site and the GABA binding site, determined by pentobarbital stimulation of [3H] muscimol binding, remained unaltered. However, there was a significant increase with aging in the efficacy of the GABA-enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. On the other hand, we have also detected a significant increase in the proportion of type I benzodiazepine receptor in 24-month-old hippocampal membranes. We propose that the age-related increase in the efficacy of GABA-enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding could be correlated with the increase in the proportion of type I benzodiazepine receptor. Based on these results it is tempting to speculate that the age-dependent modifications on the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor might reflect an age-dependent neuronal degeneration of the hippocampus or the hippocampal formation.", 
    "22": "Using [3H]flunitrazepam in radioligand binding assays, we determined equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd's) at 37 degrees C for 22 benzodiazepines (15 parent compounds and 7 major metabolites) at benzodiazepine binding sites in human frontal cortex. This list included several compounds never studied before at human receptors. Although dissociation was too rapid to measure reliably at this temperature, the Kd's for flunitrazepam were not significantly different when either rapid filtration or centrifugation was used to separate the bound from free radioligand. The most potent compound was triazolam (Kd = 0.54 nM); the least potent, chlordiazepoxide (Kd = 684 nM). The Kd's were significantly lower (about 3- to 7-fold) for several compounds tested at an equilibrium temperature of 0 degrees C compared to those obtained at 37 degrees C. There was a strong correlation for 15 compounds for the log Kd at rat brain receptors (data obtained from the literature) vs. the log Kd for human brain. In addition, the log Kd's of the various benzodiazepines for their receptor were significantly correlated with the log of their minimum daily dosages used to treat patients. Many of the benzodiazepines have clinically important active metabolites that have higher affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites in human brain than their parent compounds. Such data have important implications in the clinical use of these compounds.", 
    "23": "The properties of [3H]clonazepam, [3H]diazepam and [3H]zolpidem (N,N,6[trimethyl-2-(4-methyl-phenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide hemitratrate) binding to synaptic membranes of cerebellum, cortex, olfactory bulb, striatum and spinal cord of rat were compared to the binding properties of [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]flumazenil and [3H]midazolam. In the cerebellar, cortical and olfactory bulb membranes, the density of high-affinity binding sites of all these tritiated benzodiazepine (BZ) ligands is almost identical. In contrast, in the striatum, the density of [3H]clonazepam and [3H]zolpidem binding sites is approximately 60 and 30%, respectively, of the density of [3H]diazepam, [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]flumazenil sites. In spinal cord membranes, the number of high-affinity binding sites of [3H]clonazepam and [3H]zolpidem is less than 20% of the number of binding sites for [3H]diazepam, [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]flumazenil and [3H]midazolam. Moreover, the displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam from spinal cord membranes by clonazepam and zolpidem was characterized by high IC50 values and Hill slopes significantly less than 1. Because [3H]BZ ligand binding in the spinal cord is enhanced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), these data suggest that different regions of the rat central nervous system may contain different GABA-BZ receptor subtypes. The different pharmacological properties of clonazepam, diazepam and zolpidem (i.e., regarding their ability to enhance bicuculline seizure threshold, to decrease locomotor activity, to induce ataxia or to elicit anticonflict action) further support the concept that in the rat central nervous system preferential occupancy of heterogeneous GABAA receptors by these drugs can be related to their effects on behavior.", 
    "24": "The gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor of codfish brain has been purified to homogeneity and contains a single polypeptide band of 56 kDa molecular mass. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) of codfish GABA receptor photoaffinity-labeled by both [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]Flu) and [3H]muscimol showed a single radioactive peak with molecular mass of 56 kDa, in contrast to the multiple subunits found in other vertebrate species. The codfish receptor, purified using benzodiazepine (BZ, Ro 7-1986/1) affinity chromatography, contains an apparent single band both by isoelectric focussing and on a silver-stained SDS gel. The receptor density and affinity constants for [3H]muscimol and [3H]Flu binding are comparable to those in mammalian brain, and the specific activity (greater than 1,000 pmol/mg of protein) is comparable to that of preparations purified from those sources. The pharmacological specificity of the codfish GABA-BZ receptor is generally similar to that of mammalian brain, including GABA-BZ coupling. The BZ binding exhibits homogeneous kinetic properties resembling those of the mammalian BZ2 receptor type, and shows strong GABA enhancement of [3H]Flu binding and weaker pentobarbital potentiation. This is consistent with other observations of an earlier phylogenetic, as well as ontogenetic, emergence in mammals of the BZ2 receptor subtype than the BZ1. Codfish GABA receptor is postulated to be a homo-oligomer in which the conformation of GABA and BZ recognition sites is very similar to that in the mammalian hetero-oligomeric GABAA receptor. The codfish receptor appears to be encoded by an ancestral gene and indicates an early development of BZ-GABA coupling.", 
    "25": "The influence of CCK-8 on locomotor effects associated with independent D2 receptor stimulation was studied. To selectively stimulate mesolimbic D2 receptors LY 171555 was injected into the nucleus accumbens of awake rats. Locomotor activity was measured in the open-field test. LY 171555 induced a biphasic effect: low doses stimulated, whereas higher doses inhibited locomotor activity. CCK-8 injected into the posteromedial part of the nucleus accumbens suppressed hyperlocomotion induced by LY 171555. The CCK-8 effect was prevented by the CCK-antagonist L 364,718. Our results indicate that CCK-8 modulates D2 receptor-mediated effects in the mesolimbic system.", 
    "26": "A European female sedated with midazolam developed severe aggressive behavior during insertion of implants, which increased with further increments of midazolam. This paradoxical reaction was terminated by the injection of flumazenil, after which the patient calmly underwent the procedure. At the end of the procedure she was found to have amnesia from the time of initial injection of midazolam to the end of the implant procedure.", 
    "27": "Widespread distribution of receptors for the peptide hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin in the gut and in the CNS suggests therapeutic potential for selective antagonists of these hormones. Discovery of the natural product Asperlicin provided a new class of non-peptidal CCK antagonists, but oral bioavailability in this class remained elusive. With Asperlicin as a guide, the new, selective, orally bioavailable, high affinity CCK-A antagonist, MK-329 (L-364,718; Devazepide) and CCK-B/gastrin antagonist, L-365,260 have been developed. Biological profiles of these compounds are presented and results of early clinical evaluation of MK-329 are described. The significance of these agents as models for development of non-peptidal ligands for other receptors are briefly summarized.", 
    "28": "The effects of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nitrendipine and the calcium channel activator, Bay K 8644, have been compared on the anaesthetic, ataxic and anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines. Possible interactions between the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, PK11195, and the classical benzodiazepines were also examined. Nitrendipine considerably potentiated the anaesthetic effects of benzodiazepines and increased their ataxic effects but had no effect on the anticonvulsant actions. Clonazepam did not produce anaesthesia, at doses up to 1 g kg-1 or when given with nitrendipine. When given alone, nitrendipine did not cause general anaesthesia. Nitrendipine did not appear to alter the metabolism of midazolam. The calcium channel activator, Bay K 8644, reduced the anaesthetic potency of midazolam and, when given alone, produced ataxia. It did not significantly alter central concentrations of midazolam. The \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine antagonist, PK11195, did not affect the ataxic or anaesthetic actions of benzodiazepines. These results suggest that dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels may be more important to the general anaesthetic than to the anticonvulsant actions of benzodiazepines. The \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine site did not appear to play a role in either of these properties.", 
    "29": "The effects of arginine, homoarginine, alpha-keto-delta-guanidinovaleric acid and argininic acid (guanidino compounds that were found to be increased in hyperargininemia) were evaluated on responses to gamma-aminoburtyric acid (GABA) and glycine (Gly) on mouse neurons in primary dissociated cell culture. GABA and Gly were applied iontophoretically and intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were used. The guanidino compounds rapidly and reversibly inhibited both GABA and Gly responses. The guanidino compounds inhibited GABA responses in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited Gly responses at a concentration of 10 mM. Argininic acid was the most potent in reducing inhibitory amino acid responses, followed in decreasing potency by alpha-keto-delta-guanidinovaleric acid, homoarginine and arginine. The guanidino compounds were equally potent in decreasing Gly and GABA responses. Co-application of CGS 9896, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, did not antagonize the guanidino compound-induced inhibition of GABA responses. These findings suggest that the guanidino compounds inhibited responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and Gly by blocking the chloride channel. This effect might underlie the in vivo epileptogenicity of some of the guanidino compounds and might contribute to the pathogenesis of seizures in hyperargininemia.", 
    "30": "Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are eating disorders that strike a significant number of adolescent and young adult women and carry a significant morbidity and mortality. Over the last 30 years, virtually every class of psychiatric drug as well as atypical agents have been tested in the management of these vexing and often chronic disorders. For anorexia nervosa, there is in 1991 little if any role for pharmacotherapy. Drugs used to promote food intake and weight gain, such as cyproheptadine, amitriptyline, clonidine and opiate antagonists, have provided disappointing results. For bulimia nervosa, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have confirmed an antibulimic effect for tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine and desipramine. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, while having a significant antibulimic effect, require careful adherence to a dietary regimen which may limit patient compliance. Newer antidepressants such as trazodone, amfebutamone and fluoxetine may prove useful if further study substantiates preliminary beneficial results. Other agents such as anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, lithium, fenfluramine and opiate antagonists also require additional study, indicating that the optimal integration of pharmacotherapies with other treatments awaits further research.", 
    "31": "We report the sequence of a complementary DNA (cDNA) that encodes the chicken GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit, which is extremely homologous to mammalian alpha 1 subunits. The distribution of alpha 1 subunit transcripts is shown to correlate mainly, but not completely, with the previously-reported pattern of benzodiazepine type I (BZI) binding sites in the avian brain. These results suggest that the alpha 1 subunit may not necessarily be restricted to receptors having BZI pharmacology.", 
    "32": "Anxiety is a complex state that includes a broad range of classified symptoms. Anxiolytic treatment has been dominated by the use of benzodiazepine drugs (BZs), which is often prolonged. However, the multiplicity of anxiety states and the lack of BZ specificity preclude the potent targeting of the drugs to different states, and point to the problem of drug dependence. Furthermore, animal models of anxiety give different results when challenged with apparently similar drugs. The search for alternative drugs with a higher specificity has led to 5-HT receptor subtypes. In this review, Simon Green describes how recent research might have dual benefits: in improving drug therapy of anxiety in humans, and in analysing and categorizing more clearly the concept of anxiety itself.", 
    "33": "Carbachol induces a novel tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes bathed in Tyrode's solution with 20 mM Cs+. This action of carbachol, which initiates a series of reactions that culminates in a catecholamine-independent positive inotropic effect, occurs through muscarinic rather than nicotinic cholinoceptive sites. The concentrations of muscarinic antagonists required to suppress the carbachol-induced current by 50% were 2.1 nM, 270 nM, and 1700 nM for atropine, AF-DX 116, and pirenzepine, respectively. These results indicate that an M2-selective antagonist, AF-DX 116, is more potent than an M1-selective antagonist, pirenzepine, as an inhibitor. The M1-selective agonist McN-A-343 did not induce an inward current and blocked that caused by carbachol, in a rapid and reversible manner. This finding is also consistent with the conclusion that the muscarinic receptor involved in the regulation of myocardial Na+ channels by carbachol cannot be distinguished from the M2 subtype of such receptors. Treatment with pertussis toxin did not affect the ability of carbachol to induce an inward current in ventricular myocytes and reversed the current activated by carbachol in atrial cells from outward to inward. The electrophysiological and pharmacological nature of the carbachol-induced current in ventricular myocytes is very similar to that of the acetylcholine-induced current in Xenopus oocytes transfected with porcine M2, but not M1, muscarinic receptors. In both preparations, Na+ is the dominant charge carrier, intracellular Ca2+ is not involved in opening the Na+ channel, and an M2 receptor is involved.", 
    "34": "The action of zinc on chloride currents evoked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was examined on cultured hippocampal neurons using whole cell voltage clamp and outside-out patch recording. Zn (5-30 microM) noncompetitively blocked responses evoked by GABA (0.5-100 microM), but did not affect either the time-to-peak or desensitization of the macroscopic current. In outside-out patches, Zn had no effect on the mean conductance or lifetime of the 19 or 30 pS openings of the GABA channel; however, the frequency of channel opening was markedly decreased in a voltage-independent manner. Zn inhibition of GABA responses appeared to be independent of the benzodiazepine binding site as Zn was effective in the presence of either diazepam or Ro15-1788, a competitive antagonist of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. In contrast to prior reports, Zn also inhibited GABA currents in a similar manner on cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons. These results suggest that Zn acts at an extracellular site on the GABAA receptor complex, which is distinct from either the GABA or benzodiazepine binding sites. The structural similarity of the Cys-Cys loop of the alpha and gamma GABAA receptor subunits to some Zn-binding proteins suggests one possible region for a Zn binding site.", 
    "35": "The effects of acute administration of ethanol on t-[35S]Butylbiclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding measured ex vivo in unwashed membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex were investigated. Ethanol, given i.g., decreased in a dose-related (0.5-4 g/kg) and time-dependent manner the binding of 35S-TBPS. This effect was similar to that induced by the administration of diazepam (0.5-4 mg/kg i.p.). Scatchard plot analysis of this radioligand binding revealed that ethanol, differently from diazepam, decreased the apparent affinity of 35S-TBPS recognition sites whereas it failed to change the density of these binding sites. The effect of ethanol on 35S-TBPS binding could not be reversed by the previous administration to rats of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate). Vice versa, the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5a][4,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) (8 mg/kg i.p.), prevented completely ethanol-induced decrease of 35S-TBPS binding. The ability of Ro 15-4513 to prevent the action of ethanol was shared by the anxiogenic and proconvulsant beta-carboline derivatives, FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (0.6 mg/kg i.v.), which, per se, enhanced this parameter. Moreover, ethanol (0.5-4 g/kg) was able to reverse the increase of 35S-TBPS binding elicited by the s.c. injection of isoniazid (350 mg/kg) and to clearly attenuate the severity of tonic-clonic seizures produced by this inhibitor of the GABAergic transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "In a variety of animal models of acute pancreatitis, cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists have ameliorated the injury response. These results suggest that cholecystokinin may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis initiated by multiple stimuli. In an effort to test this theory, a sensitive and high affinity cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist L364,718 was administered to four different models of acute pancreatitis that were produced in the ex vivo perfused canine pancreas preparation. The four models of pancreatitis were initiated by cerulein infusion, partial duct obstruction with secretin stimulation, oleic acid infusion, and a 2-hour period of ischemia. In each model, pancreatitis was manifest by edema formation, weight gain, and hyperamylasemia during a 4-hour perfusion. In cerulein infusion-induced pancreatitis L364,718 inhibited edema formation and weight gain (31 +/- 5 gm versus 7 +/- 6 gm; p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased plasma amylase activity (36,605 +/- 21,216 U/dl versus 9421 +/- 5149 U/dl; p less than 0.05). The acute pancreatitis induced by the other three stimuli was not ameliorated by L364,718 treatment. We conclude that in the ex vivo-perfused canine pancreas preparation cerulein-induced pancreatitis is mediated at least in part by the cholecystokinin receptor. Early blockade of the cholecystokinin receptor was of no benefit in treating the other models of pancreatitis, suggesting that cholecystokinin is not involved in the early pathogenesis.", 
    "37": "The pharmacokinetics of a new psychotropic drug bemithil was studied after single and long-term administrations under monotherapy and in combination with phenazepam in patients with asthenoneurotic disturbances. A high degree of correlation for some pharmacokinetic parameters of bemithil following the administration of the drug test dose and its global therapeutic effect was established.",

It was found that when administered in doses of 1.0-5.0 mg/kg phenazepam exerts the stimulating effect on the formation of antibodies to the thymus-dependent antigen (ram erythrocytes). When administered in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg the drug increases the titer of antibodies to Vi antigen, ADCC, the ability of macrophages to induce the humoral immune response and also abolishes the studied manifestations of the postintoxication immunodeficiency state caused by anticholinesterase agent.", 
    "39": "This is a review and update on hypnotics. Insomnia is a symptom of many underlying conditions which have to be evaluated before resorting to medication. Hypnotics are useful for short term treatment. The benzodiazepines have replaced the barbiturates which have a low therapeutic index. The action of benzodiazepines depends on their absorption rate, lipophilicity, half-life and metabolites. They induce sleep, prolonged sleep time and reduced night wakenings. They increase stage 2 sleep, and reduce stage 1, 3, 4 and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Flurazepam, triazolam and midaolam are described. The benzodiazepines suffer from many unwanted effects which include tolerance, dependence, withdrawal symptoms, rebound insomnia, hang over effect, alteration of memory process and synergism with ethanol. The ideal hypnotic should be free from these drawbacks. Three new generation hypnotics quazepam, zopiclone and zolpidem are described. Drugs suitable for long term hypnotic medication include antipsychotics, antidepressants and antihistamines.", 
    "40": "Pharmacoepidemiological data show that long-term treatment accounts for a considerable part of benzodiazepine prescriptions in primary care practice. Prescription and intake patterns were, therefore, investigated in a study of 196 patients who had been treated with benzodiazepines for longer than six months by internists or general physicians in private practice. Patients were 64 years of age on average, half of them being 65 years or older. Females were in the majority (73.5%). The average duration of tranquilizer or hypnotic intake was 11.0 years, or 5.3 years for the current benzodiazepine medication. The mean daily dose was 9 mg diazepam equivalent. All benzodiazepine hypnotics and 61% of benzodiazepine tranquilizers had been prescribed solely for night-time use. Only 6% of the patients were taking benzodiazepines as single medication: on average they were taking 3.1 additional types of medication for other conditions, these being predominantly cardiac and antirheumatic/analgesic in nature. One in five patients was taking additional psychotropic medication. The compliance coefficient was on average 0.8, showing that patients did not tend to abuse benzodiazepines, with noncompliance generally being similar to noncompliance with other forms of medication.", 
    "41": "The pharmacokinetic profiles of halazepam (HL) and its metabolites, desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ), oxazepam (OX), 3-hydroxyhalazepam (OH-HL), and conjugates of oxazepam (OX-CONJ) and 3-hydroxyhalazepam (OH-HL-CONJ) were studied in 4 naive dogs following single intravenous (2 mg/kg) and oral (112.5 mg/kg) administrations of HL and in 5 dependent dogs chronically dosed with HL (450 mg/kg/day q.i.d.). HL is rapidly metabolized to DMDZ as the principal metabolite but appreciable levels of HL, OX and OH-HL were measured in plasma and the brain tissue. High levels of conjugated metabolites were measured in plasma. The steady-state plasma concentrations of HL and its unconjugated metabolites can be predicted from the single dose study. Halazepam does not serve as a simple prodrug for DMDZ in producing physical dependence in dogs.",

The problems of watchfulness in car-driving, is sleepiness, are indeed linked to a genuine disorder in the sleep-wake rythm and attention should be drawn to them in medico-legal cases. Investigations and clinical examinations concerning 110 experts' reports confirm the role played by sleep' disorders in the occurrence of car accidents. Prevention in actually possible. Early detection can take place at various levels and concerns general practitioners, specialists of industrial medicine and specialists for driving tests. In France, the list of diseases associated with, and retraining of a driving license refer only to concentration disorders induced by drug administration, but do not mention sleep pathologies (sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy, etc). What is the responsibility of a driver who ignores or says nothing about a sleep pathology from which he is suffering? Is it really necessary to include these pathologies on such a list? It could be more useful to make a large audience; including children, aware of the physiology and pathology of sleep. It appears, from experts' reports, that the management of the problem requires a \"driving hygiene\".", 
    "43": "This study evaluated the Abbott ADx and TDx serum benzodiazepine assays for the analysis of alprazolam in serum. These systems were compared to the EMIT tox serum benzodiazepine assay and a gas chromatographic (GC) method. Six-point calibration curves (nordiazepam concentrations from 50-1,000 ng/mL) were stable on both instruments for at least 14 days. The precision of these assays was determined using three control serums containing 75,300, and 700 ng/mL of nordiazepam. On the ADx, within-run coefficients of variation (CV) for the three controls were 3.9, 3.1, and 2.8%, respectively. Between-run CVs were 2.8, 1.4, and 1.2% on the ADx. For the TDx, within-run CVs were 1.9, 1.4, and 2.6, and between-run CVs were 4.1, 1.3, and 1.9% for the three controls. Percent cross-reactivity of serum alprazolam calibrators (25-100 ng/mL) ranged from 77-88% on the ADx and 60-79% on the TDx. 99 serum specimens containing alprazolam were analyzed with the ADx, TDx, EMIT, and by gas chromatography-electron capture detection (sensitivity of 5 ng/mL). Overall, 48 of 99 specimens on the TDx, 43 of 99 on the ADx (both with a cutoff of 12 ng/mL), and 0 of 99 by EMIT (cutoff of 300 ng/mL) were positive. Of the specimens reading negative on the Abbott systems, 43 of 51 TDx results and 44 of 56 ADx results were obtained in specimens containing less than 25 ng/mL of alprazolam. For specimens with more than 25 ng/mL of alprazolam in serum (by GC), 8 specimens were negative on the TDx and 12 on the ADx.", 
    "44": "The effects of calmodulin (CaM) antagonists (W-7, W-5, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, quinacrine, diazepam, propericyazine and carmidazolium) on the sodium and potassium channels were studied on the intracellularly perfused and voltage-clamped giant axon of the squid. It was found that the drugs are more potent blockers of the sodium current than of the potassium current. The drugs also reduce the sodium gating current. The blockage of the sodium and gating current can be explained by assuming that the drugs interact with the sodium gating subunit in one of its closed states. The site of action is probably the intracellular surface of the axolemma where presumably a Ca(2+)-calmodulin complex can be formed.", 
    "45": "The analgesic effects of mu- and kappa-opioid agonists, including morphine, FK33,824, U50,488H, tifluadom and bremazocine, have been determined in C57BL/6J-bgJ (beige) and CXBK mice which are hyporesponsive to mu-opioid receptor-mediated analgesia compared with those of control mice (C57BL/6J (C6J), C57BL/6By (C6By), BALB/cBy (BALB] using an abdominal constriction assay. The analgesic effect of subcutaneously administered morphine and FK33,824 in both beige and CXBK mice was significantly reduced compared with the controls and the analgesic effect of U50,488H and tifluadom in beige mice was significantly reduced compared with the wild strain (C6J). No reduction of analgesic effect of U50,488H and tifluadom was seen in CXBK compared with its progenitor strains, C6By and BALB, except for a reduction of the effect of tifluadom in CXBK compared with C6By. There was no strain difference in the bremazocine-induced analgesia. These results suggest that the beige mouse has a deficit in analgesia mediated by both mu- and kappa-opioid receptors, whereas the CXBK is deficient only in the mu-opioid receptor-mediated analgesia.", 
    "46": "The effect of 12-day intraperitoneal i.p. administration of vigabatrin (GVG, gamma-vinyl GABA) to rats on the neurotransmission-related amino acids in various brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord), cisternal fluid (CSF) and blood was studied. Results showed that GVG administration increased the levels of GABA in cortical and subcortical regions of the brain and CSF without affecting GABA and benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex. In addition, a dose-dependent decrease was noted in the concentration of glutamate in the hippocampus and in the concentrations of aspartate and glutamine in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The changes in the levels of amino acids in the brain, except for that of GABA, were not reflected in the CSF, however, and the levels of amino acids in discrete brain regions did not show any correlation with those in the serum or in the CSF. The results suggest that GVG administration might suppress development and spread of seizures not only by elevating the level of the inhibitory amino acid GABA, but also by decreasing the levels of excitatory amino acids in the brain.", 
    "47": "Stiff-man syndrome (Moersch-Woltman syndrome) is a rare disorder of motor function characterized by involuntary stiffness of axial muscles and superimposed painful muscle spasms, which are often induced by startle or emotional stimuli. The standard treatment has been benzodiazepines. An association has been reported between stiff-man syndrome and epilepsy, insulin-dependent diabetes, and a variety of organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Antibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase and against pancreatic islet cells have been detected in the serum and cerebrospinal of patients with stiff-man syndrome. These findings suggest that stiff-man syndrome may be an autoimmune disease. Preliminary reports indicate that patients with stiff-man syndrome have a favorable response to plasma exchange and corticosteroid therapy.", 
    "48": "A GABA-operated Cl- channel that is bicuculline-insensitive is abundant in the nervous tissue of cockroach, in housefly head preparations and thorax/abdomen preparations, and in similar preparations from several insect species. Bicuculline-insensitive GABA-operated Cl- channels, which are rare in vertebrates, possess sites of action of benzodiazepines, steroids and insecticides that are pharmacologically-distinct from corresponding sites on vertebrate GABAA receptors. The pharmacological profile of the benzodiazepine-binding site linked to an insect CNS GABA-operated Cl- channel resembles more closely that of vertebrate peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites. Six pregnane steroids and certain polychlorocycloalkane insecticides, which are active at t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS)-binding sites, also differ in their effectiveness on vertebrate and insect GABA receptors. Radioligand binding and physiological studies indicate that in insects there may be subtypes of the GABA receptor. Molecular biology offers experimental approaches to understanding the basis of this diversity.", 
    "49": "GABAA-receptors were localized in explant cultures of rat cerebellum and in dissociated primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells and rat cerebellar astrocytes using the monoclonal antibody bd-17 directed against the beta-subunit of the GABAA/benzodiazepine/chloride channel complex. At the light microscope level specific staining of GABAA-receptors was localized in various types of neurones in explant cultures of rat cerebellum using the indirect peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique, whereas no specific staining was found in astrocytes. At the electron microscope level labeling of GABAA-receptors was observed in the plasma membrane of both the cell bodies and processes in dissociated primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells using an indirect preembedding immunogold staining technique which in contrast to the classical PAP technique allows quantitative estimations to be performed. Quantification of the labeling intensity revealed a higher concentration of GABAA-receptors per microns plasma membrane in the cell bodies than in the processes. In discrete areas an extremely high density of the GABAA-receptors was observed. No specific labeling of GABAA-receptors was observed in dissociated primary cultures of cerebellar astrocytes.", 
    "50": "The GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor protein from bovine brain was purified by affinity chromatography and the subunit composition examined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Protein staining revealed a doublet at 51-53 kDa, a band at 55 kDa, and a broad band at 57-59 kDa. The 51 and 53 kDa bands co-migrated with the alpha 1 and alpha 2 gene products identified by Western blotting with subtype-specific antibodies. These two bands were also photoaffinity labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam, as was a breakdown product at 44 kDa. Partial sequencing of proteolytic fragments of these polypeptides yielded sequences found in all alpha clones, and identified the benzodiazepine binding site within residues 8-297 and probably between 106-297 of alpha 1; the 44 kDa and 31 kDa bands yielded fragments containing alpha 3 sequence. The native alpha 3 polypeptide was identified with subtype-specific antibody at 57 kDa overlapping with the two major bands photolabeled with [3H]muscimol at 55 and 58 kDa. Antisera to a beta-selective peptide recognized four bands at 60, 58, 57 and 55 kDa. Thus, one can identify 6-8 distinct polypeptides with the possibility of another 4-6 in purified GABAA receptor proteins, depending on brain region, consistent with the family of gene products suggested by molecular cloning.", 
    "51": "The tritiated alpha-isobutylhydroxybenzyl alcohol (3H-G018) was found to be able to bind benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor on the rat brain membrane. The 125I labeled G-018 also had the similar binding activity with this receptor. In the present investigation, we observed that gastrodigenin and its derivatives inhibited the 125I-G018 binding of BZ receptor competitively, but no inhibition was observed with gastrodin. The results suggested that Gastrodigenin was bound to BZ receptor, and otherwise, gastrodin would have no direct interaction with BZ receptor. Probably, it might metabolize into gastrodigenin in vivo, and then got through the blood brain barrier and bound to BZ receptor, which mediated its pharmacological effects on the central nervous system.",

The methodology of experimental study of nootropics is covered which is based on modelling different disorders of the integrative activity of the brain including old animals. The modern concepts of the mechanisms of action of agents are given. The most promising new trends in the investigation and search for nootropics on the basis of neuropeptides, ligands of GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, antioxidants, membrane stabilizers, protein synthesis stimulants, agents influencing glutamatergic system, etc. are analyzed.", 
    "53": "A dose-dependent (12.5-100 mg/kg) suppression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity was observed in mice after administration of the benzodiazepine receptor 'inverse agonist' FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide). This compound produces a syndrome resembling stress or anxiety in both animals and man. Addition of FG 7142 (1-1000 nM) to either a 4-hour 51Chromium-release assay or 5-day in vitro CTL generation system did not affect CTL activity. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) attenuated FG 7142-induced suppression of CTL activity, but had no effect when administered alone. Time-course studies indicated that FG 7142-induced suppression of CTL activity was long-lasting. The suppression of CTL activity by FG 7142 provides further evidence that the central nervous system pathways subserved by the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor chloride channel complex may play an important role in the modulation of immune function.", 
    "54": "Two groups of rats were selected from a small animal population on the basis of their exploratory activity in an elevated plus-maze model of anxiety. One group had a considerably lower and the other one a higher exploratory activity than the average total population. These subgroups were termed \"anxious\" and \"non-anxious\", respectively. In both groups central benzodiazepine binding sites in various brain structures were labelled with 3H-flunitrazepam. Peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites labelled in vitro with different tritiated ligands were also studied in several peripheral organs including blood platelets and lymphocytes. \"Anxious\" animals had a significantly lower number of 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites in the cerebral cortex but not in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In this subgroup 3H-Ro 5-4864 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine recognition sites was also lower than in the other one in adrenals, kidneys, platelets and lymphocytes. In the heart no differences of 3H-Ro 5-4864 binding between subgroups studied were found. Although in \"anxious\" rats 3H-diazepam and 3H-PK 11195 binding was significantly lower only in lymphocytes, a somewhat decreased binding to these ligands was also present in platelets. No significant differences in the affinity were found between the two groups throughout the experiments described. The results indicate that behavioral anxiety in rats is correlated not only with the lower number of central benzodiazepine receptors but also with a lower density of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in several peripheral organs including platelets and lymphocytes.", 
    "55": "The effect of the \"in vivo\" administration of sodium valproate on t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding measured \"ex vivo\" in the rat cerebral cortex was investigated. Sodium valproate produced a decrease of 35S-TBPS binding. The maximal effect (-32%) was reached with the dose of 400 mg/kg i.p., 60 min after the administration of the drug. Saturation experiments revealed that the effect of sodium valproate was due to a decrease in the total number of binding sites with no changes in the affinity constant. A small dose of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), which per se does not modify 35S-TBPS binding, markedly potentiated the inhibitory effect of sodium valproate on 35S-TBPS binding. Moreover, the \"in vitro\" addition of sodium valproate to cortical membranes failed to modify 35S-TBPS binding, indicating that the effect of the \"in vivo\" administration of this drug is not due to its direct interaction with the chloride associated binding sites. These results strongly suggest that this drug enhances the function of GABAergic synapses at the level of the GABA-coupled chloride channel. This conclusion supports the hypothesis that an enhancement of GABAergic transmission plays a role in the molecular mechanism involved in the antiepileptic action of sodium valproate.", 
    "56": "The repeated, intraperitoneal administration of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, FG 7142 (beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methylamide), leads to pharmacological kindling and an associated decrease in GABA-stimulated influx of 36Cl- into cortical membrane preparations. The chronic administration of benzodiazepine agonists results in the development of tolerance and also results in a decrease in GABA-stimulated uptake of 36Cl-. The present study was designed to evaluate further the paradoxical reports that both chronic treatment with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and inverse agonists results in a decreased ability of GABA to stimulate uptake of 36Cl- into cortical membrane preparations. The effects of continuous administration of FG 7142 on GABA-stimulated uptake of 36Cl-, the threshold for bicuculline-induced seizures and the proconvulsant actions of acute administration FG 7142 were evaluated. The continuous administration of FG 7142 resulted in an increased capacity of GABA to stimulate the uptake of 36Cl- into cortical membrane preparations and a significant increase in the seizure threshold for bicuculline following the acute administration of FG 7142. These data, therefore, indicate that changes in GABAergic function following chronic administration of GF 7142 are dependent on the regimen of administration of drug. The results also suggest that the GABA receptor homeostatically responds to continuous occupation by inverse agonists by an upregulation of its functional response to GABA.", 
    "57": "The cataleptic response of rats to (-)-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), measured using a bar test, was enhanced by subcutaneous pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg). Significant potentiation was observed when the cannabinoid was administered peripherally (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) and when it was injected bilaterally into sites in or very near the posterior medial region of the globus pallidus (30 micrograms). Similar results were obtained with (-)-11-hydroxy-delta-8-dimethylheptyl-THC (0.005 to 0.02 mg/kg i.v. and 3, 10 or 30 micrograms intracerebrally). However, the (+) isomer of the 11-hydroxy compound was inactive in the presence and absence of chlordiazepoxide. It was also found that chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced the cataleptic response to the GABA agonist, THIP (0.25 microgram), injected bilaterally into sites located in or very near the globus pallidus and that the cataleptic response to delta-9-THC (1 mg/kg i.v.) could be potentiated by chlordiazepoxide (50 micrograms), when this was injected into similar sites in the brain. The results support the hypothesis that the cataleptic response to cannabinoids is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid. They also provide evidence that cannabinoids can produce catalepsy by interacting with tissue in the vicinity of the globus pallidus and that the ability to interact in this way depends on the conformation of the cannabinoid molecule.",

The subject was scanned using tracer alone and tracer plus 4 different concentrations of unlabelled Ro 15-1788, including one concentration of unlabelled Ro 15-1788, chosen to produce maximum displacement of [11C] Ro 15-1788 from specific binding sites. Concentrations of free, unmetabolized [11C] Ro 15-1788 in plasma were estimated using a simple extraction and ultrafiltration method. Radioactivity in the regional exchangeable pool in brain was estimated under non-saturation conditions from the ratio of radioactivity in brain to plasma, under saturation conditions and the kinetics of free ligand in plasma. The specific binding was, then, estimated by the difference between the total radioactivity in brain and exchangeable pool radioactivity. Scatchard analyses were performed to yield Bmax and Kd values under pseudo-equilibrium conditions, which was observed as an increase of specific binding/free with reduction in specific binding. In cerebral cortex and cerebellum, the Bmax values were about 62-73 nmol/l and the Kd values were 3.6-6 nM in the estimation of free ligand in plasma and 12-15 nM in the estimation of exchangeable pool in brain, as free in brain.", 
    "59": "Subsensitivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists was sought in rats treated 1 or 4 weeks with flurazepam (FZP). Sensitivity to GABA and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) was assessed by measuring contralateral rotation following unilateral microinjection of drug into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). Immediately and 48 h after chronic treatment GABA, 200 micrograms or THIP, 60 ng was infused into SNpr. Immediately, but not 48 h after 1 week of FZP treatment, GABA subsensitivity was shown by a significantly reduced total number of contralateral turns and peak rotation rate. There was no change in the response to THIP after 1 week FZP treatment. Following 4 week FZP treatment, no subsensitivity to GABA or THIP was evident. Previous results showed subsensitivity to muscimol after 4, but not 1 week of FZP treatment. Since muscimol and THIP are not subject to uptake, there may be increased uptake of GABA after 1 week of FZP treatment, though it may not persist during continued treatment. Differential regulation of GABA agonist effects in SNpr may be related to their acting at differing GABAA receptor subpopulations, and variable responses of these subpopulations to chronic BZ treatment.", 
    "60": "Male rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus properties of the beta-carbolines 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC) (15.0 mg/kg) or FG 7142 (5.0 mg/kg) from vehicle in a two-lever, food-motivated operant task. Consistent with the serotonergic properties of THBC, administration of the 5HT1B agonists TFMPP and mCPP to THBC-trained rats resulted in THBC-appropriate responding. Norharmane, a beta-carboline metabolite of THBC, also mimicked the THBC discriminative stimulus. In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist FG 7142, the anxiogenic/convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), two physiological stressors and the alpha 2 adrenergic antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan failed to produce THBC-appropriate responding. In the FG 7142-trained rats, THBC and norharmane dose-dependently mimicked the FG 7142 discriminative stimulus. This generalization was not based upon the serotonergic properties of THBC and norharmane since administration of the serotonin agonist mCPP to FG 7142-trained rats failed to produce FG 7142-appropriate responding. The ability of THBC to substitute for the FG 7142 discriminative stimulus was antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor mixed agonist/antagonist CGS 9896 and the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788, indicating that THBC produces an inverse agonist stimulus in FG 7142-trained rats. These results suggest that THBC produces a discriminative stimulus which consists of both serotonergic and inverse agonist components.", 
    "61": "In reviewing recent progress concerning the motor system and drug action, the following subjects will be discussed on the basis of our data: 1) the mechanisms of action of mephenesin and baclofen, 2) baclofen and gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor, 3) GABA-, benzodiazepine receptors, 4) control of spinal motor system by descending noradrenergic neuron, 5) pharmacology of the muscle spindle, and 6) pharmaco-metrics of centrally acting muscle relaxants.", 
    "62": "The present study evaluated the effect of septal lesions on baseline startle amplitude, potentiated startle (a measure of conditioned fear), and the ability of either buspirone or diazepam to block potentiated startle. Baseline responding to an acoustic stimulus was obtained for all rats, followed by potentiated startle training (ten light-shock pairings on each of two days). Rats were then given bilateral electrolytic lesions of the septum or sham surgery. Four and seven days following surgery all rats were tested again for baseline startle amplitude. Ten days postsurgery, rats were injected with either 5.0 mg/kg buspirone or vehicle and tested for potentiated startle (increased acoustic startle in the presence of a light previously paired with shock). Five days later septal-lesioned animals were injected with either 5.0 mg/kg of diazepam or vehicle and again tested for potentiated startle. Septal lesions increased baseline startle amplitude significantly, but did not alter the magnitude of potentiated startle or impair the ability of buspirone or diazepam to block potentiated startle. In Experiment 2 rats were trained using the above procedures, and were subsequently given discrete bilateral lesions of the lateral septum or sham surgery. Lateral septal lesions again had no effect on the magnitude of potentiated startle. These findings do not support an involvement of the septum in the inhibition of fear, or in the mediation of the anxiolytic effects of buspirone or diazepam.", 
    "63": "A monoclonal antibody against benzodiazepines (21-7F9) was used to study the distribution of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity in the rat brain. Immunodensitometry in combination with image analysis were used for quantification. The results showed a ubiquitous distribution of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity throughout the brain. Very high levels of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity were found in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, in the primary olfactory cortex, in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus and in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb. High densities of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity were found in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cell layer of the olfactory tubercle, the granule layer of the dentate gyrus, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, the mammillary bodies, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and superficial grey layer of superior colliculus. The substantia nigra pars compacta, the islands of Calleja and layers II, III, V and VI of the cerebral cortex had moderate levels of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity. Lower densities were found in the internal granular layer and the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, in layers I and IV of the cerebral cortex, in the nucleus caudate-putamen and most of the thalamic nuclei. The lowest density of immunoreactivity was found in the globus pallidus, and the strata radiatum, oriens and lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus. The distribution of endogenous benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity was compared with the distribution of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor by using both immunocytochemistry and receptor autoradiography. Our studies have shown a clear mismatch between the localization of the benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity and the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "64": "The AT (alcohol-tolerant) and ANT (alcohol-nontolerant) rat lines, selected for differential sensitivity to the acute motor-impairing effects of ethanol, have been shown to differ in the ligand binding characteristics of their cerebellar GABAA receptors. In the present study, we characterized these binding differences further and determined whether similar differences are present in other rodent line pairs produced by selective breeding for differences in ethanol sensitivity. The alcohol-insensitive AT rats had more high-affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites in the cerebellum than the alcohol-sensitive ANT rats. The cerebellar \"diazepam-insensitive\" [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites were displaced by several benzodiazepine agonists (diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, and midazolam) at micromolar concentrations with greater efficacy in the ANT than the AT rats. Analyses of the displacement curves indicated that the \"diazepam-insensitive\" [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites have 30 to 300 times higher affinity to benzodiazepine agonists in the ANT than AT rats. There was no difference between the rat lines in the displacing potency of Ro 15-1788, a weak partial agonist; Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist; or Ro 5-4864, a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand. Thus, the affinity difference seen in the cerebellar [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites seems to be specific for benzodiazepine agonists. This difference in affinity may explain the behavioral difference in sensitivity to lorazepam between the rat lines. No differences in [3H]muscimol binding or in the sensitivity of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to micromolar diazepam concentrations were found between other rodent line pairs tested (LS/SS, HAS/LAS, HOT/COLD, FAST/SLOW, AA/ANA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Effects of various sedative hypnotic agents on GABA-mediated chloride flux were evaluated in whole brain membrane vesicles (microsacs) prepared from rats selectively bred for high (HAS) and low sensitivity (LAS) to an acute hypnotic dose of alcohol. The HAS rats were more sensitive to the effects of pentobarbital, phenobarbital, flunitrazepam, and ethanol on GABA-mediated chloride flux compared with the LAS rats. No differences between the lines in GABA-stimulated chloride flux were observed. Modulation of 1-[3H]-phenyl-4-butyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo(2.2.2)octane ([3H]-TBOB) and [3H]-diazepam binding also was measured. The lines did not differ in inhibition of [3H]-TBOB binding by pentobarbital, phenobarbital, muscimol or picrotoxin. Although the lines displayed almost identical KD and Bmax for [3H]-diazepam binding, the GABA agonist, muscimol, was a more potent stimulator of [3H]-diazepam binding in membranes prepared from HAS rats than from LAS rats. These findings are discussed in light of previous work using other selected lines.", 
    "66": "The effects of granisetron (160 micrograms kg-1 body weight) and lorazepam (2.5 mg) on psychometric performance were investigated in a randomized, single-blind, crossover, placebo controlled study of twelve healthy male volunteers. There was strong evidence that lorazepam impaired psychometric performance. In contrast there was very little evidence to suggest that granisetron had any impact on performance or that there was any interaction between the two compounds. The findings from this study suggest that granisetron does not impair psychometric performance and that it can be co-administered with lorazepam without producing unwanted synergistic effects.",

Compounds of series 7 and 8 were tested for their ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam from bovine brain membranes and for their in vitro biological activity. The results allowed some conclusions to be drawn about the structural requirements of the benzodiazepine recognition site within this class of unusual ligands.", 
    "68": "1. The purpose of the present investigation was to quantify the concentration-pharmacological effect relationship of midazolam in individual rats by use of effect parameters derived from aperiodic EEG analysis. By varying the rate and route of administration the role of (inter)active metabolites and development of acute tolerance was evaluated. 2. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam were determined after intravenous administration of 10 mg kg-1 during 5, 30 and 60 min and oral administration of 15 mg kg-1. Following intravenous administration the pharmacokinetics were most adequately described by a bi-exponential equation. The values (mean +/- s.e. mean, n = 20) of clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state and terminal half-life were 67 +/- 2 ml min-1 kg-1, 1.61 +/- 0.071 kg-1 and 27 +/- 1 min, respectively. Following oral administration midazolam was rapidly absorbed with a systemic availability of 45 +/- 9%. 3. The averaged amplitudes in the 11.5-30 Hz (beta) frequency band of the fronto-central lead on the left-hemisphere, as derived by aperiodic EEG analysis, was selected as a measure of the pharmacological effect of midazolam. By pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling the individual concentration-EEG effect relationships of midazolam were derived, which were successfully quantified by the sigmoidal Emax model. No marked and systematic differences in pharmacodynamic parameters were found between the rates and routes of administration. The averaged pharmacodynamic parameters of midazolam obtained after combining the results of all rates and routes of administration were (mean + s.e.mean, n = 27): Eo = 61 + 3puV s 1, Emax = 85 + 3 Vs 1, EC50 = 40 + 3 ngmlP-1 and N = 0.84 + 0.04. 4. The results of the present study show that the concentration-EEG effect relationship of midazolam can be characterized in individual animals using the amplitudes in the 11.5-30 (beta) frequency band as a measure of pharmacological response. Acute tolerance did not develop and (inter)active metabolites did not contribute to this effect parameter within the time span of the experiments.", 
    "69": "1. The effect of bath application of sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) was studied on neurones in slices containing rat raphe nucleus. 2. Intracellular recordings were made from neurones in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Some of the neurones with the characteristics of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-containing cells which were inhibited by 5-HT and excited by noradrenaline were excited by cholecystokinin. The response to cholecystokinin was dose-dependent over the range 10 to 1000 nM. 3. The response to CCK-8 persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Either reduction of extracellular calcium or addition of 25 mM magnesium did not block the CCK response, suggesting it was mediated by receptors located on the membrane of the raphe neurones. 4. The agonist and antagonist specificity of the CCK response was determined. The CCKB selective agonist, pentagastrin, was inactive when applied at concentrations up to 10 microM. the CCKA receptor antagonist L-364,718 (1 to 100 nM) blocked the response to cholecystokinin. Much higher (1-10 microM) concentrations of the CCKB receptor antagonist L-365,260 were required for inhibition of the CCK response. 5. These data support the existence of a CCK receptor, located on raphe neurones in the rat, with a pharmacological profile very similar to that described for the CCKA type.", 
    "70": "Learning and memory were previously evaluated by using the elevated plus-maze test in mice. We investigated whether this method could be used for the evaluation of amnesic properties of drugs, including those which alter behavior on the first (training) trial. Six drugs of different types, scopolamine, MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate), diazepam, butylscopolamine, methamphetamine and haloperidol were administered before training. The transfer latency of vehicle-treated mice on retention testing was significantly shorter than that on training. The transfer latencies in mice given scopolamine (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.), butylscopolamine (6 mg/kg s.c.), methamphetamine (2 and 4 mg/kg i.p.), or haloperidol (0.4 mg/kg i.p.) were significantly prolonged on training compared with those of the corresponding vehicle groups. However, significant prolongation of the transfer latency in the retention test, compared to the vehicle groups, was observed only in mice given scopolamine (3 mg/kg s.c.), MK-801 (0.1 and 0.15 mg/kg i.v.), diazepam (4 mg/kg i.p.), or methamphetamine (4 mg/kg i.p.). These results suggested that the prolongation of the transfer latency on retention testing in the plus-maze method might be used as an indicator for impairment of learning and memory induced by the drugs which have amnesic properties, and is not related to the change in transfer latency on training.", 
    "71": "The effect of two anticholinergic drugs administered intracerebroventricularly on acquisition of an 8-arm radial maze task was examined in the rat. Increasing doses of atropine (1, 4.5, 22.5, 45 micrograms/rat) and pirenzepine (4.5, 15, 60, 90 micrograms/rat) significantly impaired performance in the working-memory components of the task. For both drugs this impairment was linearly related to the log of the administered doses and log-dose-response relationship were parallel. The regression lines calculated for each parameter for both drugs were parallel to each other, thus allowing us to calculate the potency of atropine versus pirenzepine: atropine was 5.4 times more potent than pirenzepine for correct arm entries, 10 times more potent for the number of errors and 4 times more potent for the total time taken to complete the task. The relevance of M1 and M2 subtype central acetylcholine receptors in cognitive processes is discussed.", 
    "72": "The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin-induced analgesia in mice exhibits the time dependency known to occur for several other effects of the hormone, and to analyze to what extent the activity of melatonin can be inhibited by the opiate antagonist naloxone or the central-type benzodiazepine (BZP) antagonist Ro 15-1788. Analgesia was assessed with the hot plate procedure. There was a significant diurnal variation in the pain threshold, with an increase in latency during the dark phase of the daily photo period. Melatonin (20-40 mg/kg i.p.) exhibited maximal analgesic effects at late evening (20:00 h). The administration of naloxone or Ro 15-1788 at 20:00 h, although unable by themselves to modify pain threshold, blunted the analgesic response to melatonin. Significant increases in the latency of the hot plate response were found after diazepam injection, an effect blocked by Ro 15-1788 or naloxone. These results indicate that time-dependent melatonin analgesia is sensitive to opioid or central-type BZP antagonism.", 
    "73": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated 36chloride (Cl-) influx into membrane vesicles derived from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and midbrain/brainstem was evaluated in naive rats and amygdala or sham kindled rats. GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake was greatest in cortex and hippocampus of naive rats. One week after amygdala kindling, 10 microM GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx was significantly reduced in each brain region, except midbrain/brainstem, indicating a regional variation in impaired GABAergic function. Midazolam potentiation of GABA-mediated Cl- flux showed a regional variation. The effect of midazolam in kindled rats indicated either an increase in efficiency of GABA/benzodiazepine coupling in areas of reduced GABA function or its ability to restore Cl- channel function to the pre-kindled state.", 
    "74": "In order to explore the structural basis of GABAA receptor function, we have expressed murine alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma 2 subunit cDNAs by transient transfection of human 293 cells. Expression of GABAA receptors was measured by ligand binding assay and by electrophysiological analysis. As in other species, expression of the alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits produced a receptor that was insensitive to modulation by benzodiazepines as measured by electrophysiological analysis; however, a small number of flunitrazepam binding sites were detectable. The coexpression of the gamma 2 subunit was found to be essential for this modulation, and also resulted in a dramatic (14-fold) increase in the number of binding sites for flunitrazepam. On the coexpression of all 3 subunit cDNAs, a receptor was produced that exhibited a similar number of binding sites for flunitrazepam and muscimol.", 
    "75": "The mitochondrial (peripheral-type) benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) is a drug binding site associated with outer mitochondrial membranes which is coupled to intramitochondrial cholesterol transport, the rate-determining step of steroid biosynthesis. To examine the relationship between MBR function and steroid synthesis regulated by polypeptide hormones, the Y-1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig cell lines were used as model systems responsive to adrenocorticotropin and human choriogonadotropin, respectively. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine which binds to MBR with high nanomolar affinity, inhibited the steroidogenic activity of these hormones, or the activation by 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP, in both cell lines by 30-60% with an IC50 of 500-1000 nM. Scatchard analysis in both cell lines revealed one class of specific binding sites for [3H] flunitrazepam verified as being MBR by displacement studies with a series of MBR ligands. The potencies of these ligands to compete against the antagonism of hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis by flunitrazepam correlated significantly with their abilities to compete against [3H]flunitrazepam binding to MBR (r = 0.99). An inhibition in pregnenolone formation was also observed in isolated mitochondrial preparations characterized as a reduction of cholesterol transport to inner mitochondrial membranes. These observations provide unequivocal evidence that the antagonistic action of flunitrazepam is mediated through its interaction with MBR demonstrating that these drug recognition sites are coupled to steroid biosynthesis activated by tropic hormones.", 
    "76": "The ontogeny of type I and type II benzodiazepine binding sites was studied in mouse cerebellum by displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by zolpidem, a ligand specific for the type I sites. Type I binding sites predominate throughout development and in the adult while type II sites account for 25% of total cerebellar benzodiazepine binding sites at birth and, during development, decrease to 10% or less in the adult. On a per cerebellum basis type II sites increase during the first postnatal week and then remain at a steady level while type I sites increase until adulthood. These results may indicate a specific localization of the type II sites (and of the corresponding alpha-protein subunits in the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex) in structures already present at birth and developing during a short early postnatal period. The affinity of zolpidem for its high affinity (type I) binding sites increases during cerebellar ontogeny, this increase possibly indicates an epigenetic (post-translational) 'maturation' process of the corresponding receptor molecule. Hill numbers indicate the existence of an additional binding site heterogeneity greater during development but still present in the adult; probably this is to be related to the simultaneous presence of different 'maturation' stages during development and with a certain variety of the final products.", 
    "77": "The suicide rate in Norway among persons older than 15 years has increased from 10/100,000 during the period 1965-67 to 18/100,000 during the period 1985-87. Attention has been focused in particular on the higher rates among young people, and not so much on the rates among the elderly. The suicide rate for males older than 70 years increased by 51% to 27/100,000 in the 20 year period, and is now at the same level as among the age group 20-69 years. The suicide rate for females older than 70 years increased by 68% to 7/100,000 during the same period. The suicide rate for females varies more with age, and is highest (15/100,000) in the age group 50-59. In 1989, 36 patients (75% females) older than 70 years were admitted to the Medical Department. Ullev\u00e5l sykehus for self-poisoning. This is about twice as many as four years before. The annual rates of self-poisonings were 143/100,000 for females and 93/100,000 for males. The suicidal intention was much higher (61% suicidal attempts) among patients older than 70 years than among persons below this age (15%). In 44% of the cases the main problem preceding the self-poisoning was loneliness and isolation. The toxic agent was usually (56%) benzodiazepine hypnotics. The findings indicate that the suicide rates among the elderly in Norway will continue to increase, at least in the cities, where loneliness and isolation is an increasing problem.", 
    "78": "The effect of neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor agonists and antagonists was examined in the rat elevated X-maze model of anxiety. The selective CCK-B receptor antagonists CI-988 (PD 134308) and L-365,260 produced anxiolytic-like effects, whereas MK-329, a CCK-A receptor antagonist, was respectively less potent by factors of 313 and 200. The intracerebroventricular administration of the nonselective CCK receptor agonist caerulein or the selective CCK-B receptor agonist pentagastrin increased dose dependently the level of anxiety. CI-988 dose dependently antagonized the anxiogenic response to pentagastrin but not that induced by pentylenetetrazol. These results strongly suggest that activation of the brain CCK-B receptor induces anxiety and that selective antagonists of this receptor represent a separate class of anxiolytic agents.", 
    "79": "Recombinantly expressed gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors consisting of alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunits contain a binding site for benzodiazepines that differs in its properties from that of alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors. Amino acid substitutions between the GABAA receptor alpha subunits were analyzed for their effect on the binding of compounds to the benzodiazepine site. By converting ever smaller regions of the alpha 3 subunit sequence to that of the alpha 1 subunit, we show that a single substitution (glycine for glutamic acid) increases the affinity for several compounds approximately 10-fold without changing the affinity for nonselective compounds. Hence, the identified amino acids may interact directly with the ligand and define part of the benzodiazepine binding sites in these receptors.", 
    "80": "Screening of pharmacologically acceptable prototype compounds has recently led to the discovery of a series of ultraselective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication, the tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk] [1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives. The TIBO compounds completely suppress the formation of proviral DNA in acutely infected cells, as revealed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. TIBO derivatives are inhibitory to the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 but not that of HIV-2 or other retroviruses. The inhibition is most effective with poly(C)-oligo(dG) as the template/primer, and it is selectively directed against the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and not the accompanying DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H activity of HIV-1 RT. Kinetic studies point to an uncompetitive inhibition with regard to the template/primer. TIBO compounds are active against HIV-1 replication through a unique interaction with HIV-1 RT. The experimental data indicate the existence of a target on HIV-1 RT that is responsible for the inhibition of replication and a mode of action unrelated to that of previously studied RT inhibitors.", 
    "81": "Pre-weaning rat pups emit ultrasonic vocalizations when removed from the litter. These 'separation-induced vocalizations' (SIV) are suppressed by classical benzodiazepine anxiolytics and by non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics which lack muscle relaxant and sedative properties. The present study used the SIV model to assess potential anxiolytic properties of compounds which target different sites associated with the NMDA receptor complex. Comparison was made to drugs which affect benzodiazepine or serotonin (5-HT) receptors. Muscle relaxant potential was assessed using 'TIP' (time on an inclined plane), the amount of time a pup was able to retain its position on a steeply inclined surface. Mephenesin, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, significantly suppressed TIP but not SIV. The benzodiazepine agonist diazepam suppressed both SIV and TIP, whereas the 5-HT1A partial agonists, buspirone and MDL 73,005EF, suppressed SIV without affecting TIP. The 5-HT2 antagonist MDL 11,939 suppressed TIP but not SIV, whereas neither measure was affected by the 5-HT3 antagonist MDL 73,147EF. SIV was suppressed by NMDA antagonists including those acting at the glutamate recognition site (D,L-amino-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5) and MDL 100,453) or at the ion channel (MK-801), or by the strychnine-insensitive glycine antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA). TIP was suppressed even more potently by AP5, MDL 100,453 and MK-801, whereas 5,7-DCKA was inactive on this measure. Thus, antagonists acting at different sites present on the glutamate recognition site exhibit potential anxiolytic activity, but the glycine antagonist was unusual in its lack of prominent muscle relaxant side effects.", 
    "82": "Muscarinic receptors involved in cholinergic neurotransmission were studied in isolated innervated guinea-pig tracheas using preganglionic (nerve) and postganglionic (field) stimulation, after blocking sympathetic effects with bethanidine (5 microM). Neostigmine (10 nM) significantly increased responses to nerve and field stimulation. The M1 antagonist pirenzepine (0.1-100 nM) selectively reduced tracheal responses to nerve stimulation in control and in neostigmine-treated tissues. The M2 antagonist gallamine (0.1-100 microM) significantly increased tracheal responses to nerve and field stimulation in control and in neostigmine-treated preparations. At concentrations that increased baseline tone, oxotremorine, arecoline and pilocarpine decreased responses to nerve and field stimulation. Gallamine (30 microM) selectively reduced the inhibitory effects of these agonists on responses to nerve and field stimulation. The findings indicate that cholinergic neurotransmission in guinea-pig trachea is modulated by facilitatory M1 receptors at parasympathetic ganglia and inhibitory M2 receptors at the postganglionic nerve endings.", 
    "83": "Benzodiazepines have been regarded as relatively \"safe\" drugs where fatal poisonings are concerned. The very potent benzodiazepines have, to a certain extent, changed this viewpoint and since triazolam was introduced in Denmark in 1978, six fatal intoxications have occurred in East Denmark. Triazolam analyses were performed by capillary gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. In the only case where no ethanol was present, a blood triazolam concentration of 0.3 mumol/kg was detected. In one case no blood was available because of putrefaction, and muscle was analysed for triazolam instead of blood. The concentration range in the four cases with an ethanol concentration of 1-2 mg/g is 0.1-0.6 mumol/kg. The blood concentrations from these six fatal intoxications are compared to blood concentrations from living persons. The whole blood concentrations from living persons were in the range 0.005-0.08 mumol/kg (n = 28) with an average concentration of 0.034 mumol/kg."
