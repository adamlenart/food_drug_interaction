    "0": "1. The techniques and apparatus used for investigation of the interaction of various psychotropic drugs with ethanol in mice are described. The parameters measured were (a) length of loss of righting reflexes; (b) continuous coma; (c) subjects remaining in coma 12 hr after dosing; (d) changes in toxicity.2. The following drugs were tested: amitriptyline, trimipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, desipramine, thioridazine, phenelzine, methylphenidate, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, phenobarbitone, and diazepam. The total number of mice used was 3,140.3. Imipramine caused no significant changes in the effects of ethanol. Methylphenidate and desipramine protected the mice against ethanol induced coma. All other drugs induced statistically significant potentiation of the depressant and toxic effects of ethanol in mice.4. Late (delayed) deaths after a tricyclic antidepressant have been noted in animals and man.5. It is suggested that the potentiation of alcohol by some psychotropic drugs may add to the hazards of drug overdosage and contribute to traffic accidents. Hence it is necessary to test all psychotropic drugs for interaction with alcohol.", 
    "1": "Plasma growth hormone (GH), insulin, cortisol, and glucose were measured during sleep on 38 nights in eight young adults. Blood was drawn from an indwelling catheter at 30-min intervals; EEG and electrooculogram were recorded throughout the night. In seven subjects, a plasma GH peak (13-72 mmug/ml) lasting 1.5-3.5 hr appeared with the onset of deep sleep. Smaller GH peaks (6-14 mmug/ml) occasionally appeared during subsequent deep sleep phases. Peak GH secretion was delayed if the onset of sleep was delayed. Subjects who were awakened for 2-3 hr and allowed to return to sleep exhibited another peak of GH secretion (14-46 mmug/ml). Peak GH secretion was not correlated with changes in plasma glucose, insulin, and cortisol. The effects of 6-CNS-active drugs on sleep-related GH secretion were investigated. Imipramine (50 mg) completely abolished GH peaks in two of four subjects, whereas chlorpromazine (30 mg), phenobarbital (97 mg), diphenylhydantoin (90 mg), chlordiazepoxide (20 mg), and isocarboxazid (30 mg) did not inhibit GH peaks. Altered hypothalamic activity associated with initiation of sleep results in a major peak of growth hormone secretion unrelated to hypoglycemia or changes in cortisol and insulin secretion."
