    "0": "The drugs prescribed for 280 women with hip fractures (mean age 83 years) were compared with those prescribed for 145 women controls (mean age 81 years) as recorded in a family practice age-sex register. Thirty-three percent of the fracture patients were taking diuretics compared with 24% of the controls (.10 greater than P greater than .05). Forty-six percent of these diuretics taken by the fracture group (compared with 40% taken by the controls) were either loop or potassium sparing diuretics in combination with another diuretic. Twenty-five percent of the controls (compared with 9% of the fracture patients) were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (P less than .001). The greater use of NSAIDs by control subjects may be due to the small overlap between osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. No significant differences were found for digoxin, anti-hypertensive drugs, and those taking no drugs. Thirty percent of fracture patients were taking sedatives and hypnotics compared with 28% of controls. Within this category, 54% of the fracture patients and 80% controls were receiving drugs (mainly benzodiazepines) with half-lives longer than 24 hours. Thus, this population did not confirm a previously identified association between long-acting sedatives and the risk of fracture. As only 3.5% of fracture patients and 2.1% controls were receiving phenothiazines, a role for these drugs in hip fracture cannot be ruled out. In summary, hip fracture patients were slightly more likely to be taking diuretics and somewhat less likely to be taking NSAIDs than controls but there were no differences with respect to other drugs.", 
    "1": "Intraperitoneally administered Ro 15-4513 and ethanol (ETOH), singly and in combination, were examined in rats. Leaping, climbing, bar-pressing, open-field (O-F) activity, as well as concentrations of ETOH in rebreathed air, were studied. Rats in the ETOH (1.2 g/kg) plus Ro 15-4513 (3 mg/kg) condition evinced a jumping performance significantly better than that of the ETOH singly-treated rats; the ETOH (1.2 g/kg) plus Ro 15-4513 (10 mg/kg) condition was intermediate to those of the ETOH and vehicle conditions. In the climbing and bar-pressing experiments, Ro 15-4513 did not attenuate the ETOH-induced impairments. Yet, ETOH improved performance of the Ro 15-4513 high dose (10 mg/kg) condition in the climbing situation. Additional findings were that a) intrinsic activity was noted with Ro 15-4513 in the climbing and bar-pressing situations, and b) the Ro 15-4513/ETOH combination in the O-F test resulted in reduced defecation (antagonism) and rearing activity similar to that of the ETOH-treated rats (lack of antagonism). Concentrations of ETOH in rebreathed air suggested no significant differences between the ETOH singly as compared to the ETOH plus Ro 15-4513 groups. Thus the antagonism of ETOH by Ro 15-4513 was dependent on the parameter examined. Additional experiments examined combinations of Ro 15-4513, Ro 15-1788, diazepam, and pentobarbital in the bar-pressing situation. Results were compatible with the view that Ro 15-4513 acts as a partial benzodiazepine inverse agonist.", 
    "2": "Twenty adult surgical patients were anaesthetized with high-dose midazolam and alfentanil by infusion, vecuronium, and intubated and ventilated with 50% N2O in O2. The midazolam and alfentanil infusions were stopped at the end of surgery. Residual neuromuscular blockade and ventilatory depression were antagonized and the patients extubated. In the recovery room, patients were randomly allocated to receive either flumazenil 1 mg of placebo i.v. Before, and until 2 h after injection, patients were asked to perform psychomotor tests. In addition, sedation, comprehension and orientation were scored. The flumazenil (n = 10) and the placebo (n = 10) groups were comparable. Prior to injection all patients were heavily sedated. After flumazenil all were awake within 2-3 min, but fell asleep again 15-60 min later. The improvement in test scores was sustained for a longer time. After placebo, patients awoke in 1-2 h. At 60 and 120 min, test scores in the two groups were similar. Heart rate, blood pressure and respiration rate did not change. No side-effects were observed or reported. It is concluded that flumazenil is an effective and safe antagonist of high dose midazolam, with a rapid onset but a short duration of action.", 
    "3": "Application by pledget of the M1-antimuscarinic receptor agent pirenzepine (40 mM) to the rostral chemosensitive areas of the ventrolateral medulla in anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized, glomectomized, and servoventilated cats inhibited the slope of the integrated phrenic response to CO2 by 32.5% (P less than 0.03) and the maximum value by 21.1% (P less than 0.01). Similar application of the imidazole-histidine blocking agent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) decreased the slope by 40.3% (P less than 0.01) and the maximum value by 29.3% (P less than 0.05). Both responses confirm previous results. DEPC treatment decreased the effectiveness of subsequent pirenzepine application such that although slope and maximum were further decreased, the values were not significantly different from those after DEPC. Pirenzepine treatment prevented any subsequent DEPC inhibitory effect. The results raise the possibility that the inhibitory effects of DEPC on CO2 chemosensitivity are via muscarinic receptors and that muscarinic receptor involvement in CO2 chemosensitivity requires the presence of imidazole-histidine. Analysis by scintillation counting of successive 100-micron sections of medulla after rostral area application of [3H]pirenzepine indicated that the pirenzepine and DEPC effects are most probably within 2.0 mm of the ventral surface as measured from the midline, well away from the dorsal and ventral respiratory group neurons.", 
    "4": "Small doses of benzodiazepines stimulate behavioural output in experimental animals in a variety of situations. Zolpidem, which displaces benzodiazepines from their binding sites, however, has been shown to exert preferential sedative activity. In order to investigate whether small doses of zolpidem would also have stimulant effects, the actions of zolpidem and chlordiazepoxide were compared in three procedures which are sensitive to the behavioural-facilitating effects of benzodiazepines in rats. A small dose of chlordiazepoxide (3.0 mg/kg) increased locomotion in an open field whereas a large dose (30 mg/kg) suppressed this behaviour. Zolpidem (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) only decreased locomotion. The effects of both chlordiazepoxide and zolpidem were antagonised by flumazenil. Chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg/kg) increased the intake of food in rats habituated to a daily feeding schedule but similar doses of zolpidem neither increased nor decreased the intake of food. Rates of punished operant responding were increased by chlordiazepoxide (3.0-30 mg/kg) but zolpidem (1.0-4.0 mg/kg) produced no such anti-punishment effect and suppressed responding at the large dose. These results show that zolpidem does not increase behavioural output in situations which are sensitive to the stimulant effects of benzodiazepines and further emphasize the selective sedative activity of this drug.", 
    "5": "The psychomotor performance of 9 healthy volunteers was measured in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over manner after single doses (Day 1) and one-week maintenance (Day 8) with diazepam given in uncoated tablets (DZ) or in controlled-release capsule (DZ-CR). The performance was measured objectively (simulated driving, digit symbol substitution, Maddox wing, flicker fusion, tapping rate) and subjectively (visual analogue scales, questionnaires) at baseline and 1.5 and 3 hrs after the intake of DZ 15 mg, DZ-CR 20 mg, or placebo. The maintenance dose for diazepam was 10 mg daily. Subjective, but not objective, responses to placebo were evident on Day 1, but not on Day 8. As expected, DZ impaired most objective test performances on Day 1, the strongest effects seen at 1.5 hr. Subjectively it caused drowsiness and impaired performance. These effects were weaker but still significant on Day 8. DZ-CR produced less effects on both objective and subjective measurements on Day 1. It was about inert on Day 8, yet exophoria and subjective muzziness increased after the last dose; the subjects did not experience their performance as impaired. Measurements of plasma benzodiazepine concentrations confirmed the different pharmacokinetic profiles of DZ and DZ-CR due to different rates of absorption, yet characteristic accumulation of diazepam and its active metabolites during maintenance was seen with both formulations. The results suggest that DZ-CR capsule with less acute psychomotor impairment and steady pharmacokinetic profile would well suit to the treatment of anxiety for longer periods.", 
    "6": "Some patients with panic disorder exhibit an abnormal response to dexamethasone. As this phenomenon may reflect disturbances in the central noradrenergic system and as alprazolam may work through this system to produce improvement, we predicted a particularly robust response among nonsuppressors. Fifty-two patients with panic disorder or with agoraphobia with panic attacks were given alprazolam as the sole treatment during either of 2, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Though baseline clinical severity predicted globally rated outcome, baseline Dexamethasone Suppression Test results did not.", 
    "7": "Two cases of acute dystonic reactions associated with diazepam ingestion are reported. This report is a brief review of drug-induced extra-pyramidal syndromes, and a mechanism for diazepam-induced dystonic reactions is proposed. Intravenous diphenhydramine was successful in treating both patients.", 
    "8": "Although there are distinct differences in both pharmacokinetics and chemical structure, propofol has sedative effects similar to those of benzodiazepines. Both diazepam and thiopental, commonly used agents for inducing anaesthesia, show some typical neuroendocrine effects such as liberation of human growth hormone (hGH) in addition to their well-known influences on the cardiovascular system. It was our aim to examine the endocrine response of hGH after induction of anaesthesia with propofol and to compare any possible effects with those of diazepam and thiopental. The study was performed on 30 non-premedicated patients, who underwent plastic-surgery (mean age: x = 35 +/- 8.3 years, mean body weight: x = 68.9 +/- 23.2 kg). No signs of endocrine disturbances were found in the patients prior to the study. Patients were divided in a random fashion into 3 groups of 10 persons each: In group 1 propofol was given in a bolus injection (2 mg/kg) and then by infusion for a period of 10 min (0.2 mg/kg/min). In group 2 diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) and in group 3 thiopental (5 mg/kg) were administered as a bolus to induce anesthesia. All patients were intubated immediately after induction of anesthesia and then relaxed using vecuronium (1 mg/kg). Ventilation was performed mechanically during the entire operative period (N2O/O2 - FiO2:0.33, tidal volume 10 ml/kg, respiratory rate: 14/min). To maintain anesthesia halothane (0.5-1.0 vol.-%) and meperidine (0.75 mg/kg) were added 15 min after induction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Two intravenous induction techniques were compared with respect to changes in ejection fraction (EF) and central hemodynamics in 30 patients scheduled for coronary artery surgery. Left ventricular EF was measured with a collimated single crystal probe linked to a microcomputer, after injection of 200 MBq Tc 99 m HSA. Stroke volume index (SI) determined by thermodilution and EF were used to calculate left ventricular volume in end-systole and end-diastole. In 20 patients (Group I), anesthesia was induced with diazepam (94 micrograms x kg-1), thiopentone (3 mg x kg-1) and fentanyl (3 micrograms x kg-1). In 10 patients (Group II), fentanyl (30 micrograms x kg-1) was used for induction. In Group I, EF decreased from 0.43 to 0.26 at intubation, while systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) showed an increase. Left ventricular volume decreased during induction of anesthesia except during intubation. In Group II, EF and left ventricular volume remained unchanged during the study period. SVRI showed no increase at intubation. No change in contractility was indicated from the relation between the end-systolic pressure and volume, in any of the groups.", 
    "10": "Two anaesthetic techniques were compared in a randomized trial of 60 ASA I and II women admitted for diagnostic dilatation and curettage of the uterus. Group I had fentanyl 2.5 micrograms/kg and thiopentone 2 mg/kg i.v. Supplementary thiopentone 50 mg was given every 15 s until loss of the eyelid reflex. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen 2/1 together with supplementary thiopentone 50 mg as required. Group II had midazolam 0.1 mg/kg i.v. and a supplementary 0.025 mg/kg every second min until sleep or dysarthria, followed by paracervical blockade with 1% mepivacaine 10 ml on each side of the portio. There was no significant depression of the cardiovascular system. The working conditions for the gynaecologist were good in both groups. The midazolam technique gave just as good amnesia as did general anaesthesia, and there was a high degree of patient satisfaction in both groups. In the thiopentone group there was a significant depression of the respiratory rate and a significantly higher frequency of adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) as compared to the midazolam group. It is concluded that paracervical blockade combined with midazolam, titrated i.v., until sleep or dysarthria, is a recommendable anaesthetic technique for diagnostic dilatation and curettage.", 
    "11": "1. One hundred and two consecutive patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomised to be sedated with either intravenous diazepam (Diazemuls-Kabi Vitrum) or intravenous midazolam (Hypnovel-Roche). It was assumed that midazolam was likely to be approximately twice as potent as diazepam on the basis of previous work. 2. All patients had an ear oximeter attached throughout the procedure to record continuously their level of oxygen saturation. 3. All 102 patients had pre-endoscopy respiratory function tests measured and 100 wore an induction plethysmograph vest to allow continuous estimation of respiratory rate and excursion. The plethysmograph was calibrated using a pneumotachygraph, so baseline, post-injection and post-endoscopy minute volumes could be estimated. 4. The age, sex ratio and pre-endoscopy respiratory function tests of the 51 patients given intravenous diazepam in a mean dose (s.d.) of 11.5 (5.8) mg over a mean of 3.4 (0.9) min) were similar to that of the 51 patients sedated with intravenous midazolam (mean dose 6.0 (2.8) mg over 3.3 (0.9) min. 5. Both drugs significantly reduced minute volume (P less than 0.001) and oxygen saturation (P less than 0.001). Midazolam appeared to produce slightly greater hypoxaemia with 57% having falls in oxygen saturation of greater than 2.5% compared with only 35% given an equivalent dose of diazepam. 6. Ventilation was still less than baseline when re-checked some minutes after removal of the gastroscope. The speed of recovery appeared faster after diazepam sedation which is in contrast to its longer pharmacological half-life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "In a double-blind randomised four-center trial 43 patients with gastric ulcer (20 men, 23 women; mean age 52.2 years) were treated with either pirenzepine (P) 50 mg b.i.d. (n = 24) or cimetidine (C) 400 mg b.i.d. (n = 19) during six weeks. In ten patients gastric juice was examined before and at the end of the treatment for concentration and type of the microbial flora, and for nitrite concentration. After six weeks 83% of the patients in both groups were either symptom-free or clearly improved. In 15/24 patients on P (62.6%) and in 13/18 on C (72.2%) the ulcer(s) were healed at the time of control endoscopy. In the ten patients investigated, intragastric concentrations of fungi, bacteria, and nitrite were not significantly changed by the treatment. In gastric ulcer, treatment with pirenzepine 50 mg b.i.d. or cimetidine 400 mg b.i.d. during six weeks does not result in significant microbial overgrowth or generation of nitrite.", 
    "13": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a potent inhibitor of gastric emptying. We have examined the effects of a novel potent peripheral CCK receptor antagonist (L364,718) on the action of endogenous and exogenous CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) on gastric emptying in the rat. In conscious gastric fistula rats, the recovery of liquid test meals of 3.0 ml (containing phenol red as a dilution marker) was determined over periods up to 8 min. Compared with saline, gastric emptying of solutions of peptone (4.5%), 50 mM HCl, and hyperosmolal saline was significantly delayed. The emptying of saline was also delayed by intravenous infusion of CCK-8 (400 pmol.kg-1.h-1). The CCK antagonist L364,718 reversed the effect of peptone in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the response to exogenous CCK, but the emptying of physiological saline, 50 mM HCl, or hyperosmolal saline remained unchanged. A protease inhibitor (FOY-305) that is thought to release endogenous CCK by inhibiting negative feedback control by luminal proteases also delayed emptying, and this response was inhibited by L364,718. We conclude that CCK has a physiological role in the mediation of the effect of proteins on gastric emptying in the rat.", 
    "14": "Illicit-drug users may attempt to falsify results by in vitro adulteration of specimens. We investigated eight additives (NaCl, Visine, handsoap, Drano, bleach, vinegar, golden-seal tea, and lemon juice) claimed by drug users to invalidate enzyme immunoassay (EIA) drug assays. We also analyzed adulterated urine specimens to determine if they could be identified, adding adulterants at several concentrations to 222 EIA-positive specimens confirmed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to contain illicit drugs. To identify adulterated urines, we monitored pH, relative density, and urine color and turbidity at adulterant concentrations that falsified EIA results. Specimens contaminated with NaCl had relative densities greater than 1.035. Liquid Drano, bleach, and vinegar shifted urine pH outside the physiological range. Golden-seal tea caused a dark appearance, and specimens containing liquid soap were unusually cloudy. Lemon juice had no effect on the assays. Visine was the only adulterant not detected. The adulterants interfered somewhat differently with each of the drug assays. EIA assays for illicit drugs can be invalidated by specimen adulteration producing false-negative results. Therefore, if urine drug testing is to be conducted, pH, relative density, and appearance should be assessed and suspect specimens should be rejected. Not all adulterants can be detected, so observed collection is strongly recommended.", 
    "15": "A new, more sensitive than previously used anxiolytic test is described. The test consists in measuring of inhibition by punishment of drinking water necessary to swallow dry food by very hungry rats. This test reveals the anxiolytic properties of tofisopam, a clinically effective benzodiazepine anxiolytic, and of very low doses of chlordiazepoxide, both ineffective in the Vogel test, as well as anxiolytic properties of high doses of chlordiazepoxide and other anxiolytics, and confirms the lack of anxiolytic effects of major tranquilizers. The results suggest that chlordiazepoxide (and possibly other benzodiazepines) acts on two subgroups of benzodiazepine receptors, named BRI (high affinity) and BR2 (low affinity), while tofisopam acts specifically on BRI receptors. The new test is proposed as a tool for a search for drugs specifically acting on high affinity benzodiazepine BRI receptors.", 
    "16": "The possibility of a linkage between endogenous peptides and the GABA-benzodiazepine system has been greatly strengthened by reports that the brain peptides MIF-1(Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) and Tyr-MIF-1(Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) augment GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding. We evaluated the actions of fragments and analogs of these small peptides on GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding in mouse cortical brain membranes. Fragments of Tyr-MIF-1, several compounds related to MIF-1, or several analogs of Tyr-MIF-1 had no effect on binding. These results demonstrate the specificity of the effects of MIF-1 and Tyr-MIF-1 on GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding.", 
    "17": "Acute intravenous (IV) injections of temazepam were examined for the ability to impair the performance of young (3-4-month-old), mature (12-15-month-old) and old (28-30-month-old) male Fischer 344 rats in the step-down task relative to vehicle-injected controls. The effect of temazepam on the passive-avoidance response could be characterized as a U-shaped function of age. The performance of the mature rat was not significantly impaired by an IV injection of temazepam between 18 and 320 micrograms/kg. Temazepam was more effective in impairing the performance of the young and old rat. The brain levels of temazepam after a single IV injection of 18 micrograms/kg in mature and senescent rats, and 32 micrograms/kg in young rats were measured over a 2-hour time period. The brain of the mature rat was exposed to less temazepam between 0 and 120 minutes than the brain of the old rat. Therefore, the increased sensitivity of the senescent rat relative to the mature rat may in part be due to changes in the pharmacokinetics of temazepam. However, the inability of temazepam (between 18 and 320 micrograms/kg) to impair the performance of mature rats in the passive-avoidance task suggests that pharmacodynamic changes may be involved in the decreased sensitivity of mature rats relative to young and senescent rats.", 
    "18": "Benzodiazepines are used as hypnotics to reduce anxiety and give a good night's sleep on the night prior to surgery. In a double-blind procedure, patients were given either lorazepam (2 mg or 4 mg), lormetazepam (1 mg or 2 mg), nitrazepam 10 mg or placebo. Measures were taken of sleep, anxiety, memory and after-effects. There was no evidence that the drugs reduced anxiety, nor evidence of amnesia. Quality and length of sleep was shown to be better for nitrazepam (P less than 0.05), lorazepam 2 mg (P less than 0.05) and lorazepam 4 mg (P less than 0.01), compared with placebo. However, significantly higher ratings of clumsiness and confusion as after-effects were found with nitrazepam (P less than 0.05), and clumsiness (P less than 0.005), slurred speech and blurred vision (P less than 0.01), sleepiness, nausea, weakness and confusion (P less than 0.05) with lorazepam 4 mg. It was concluded that lorazepam 2 mg produced the greatest net benefit.", 
    "19": "Phenazepam stimulates the drinking behaviour of rats. Under free-choice conditions ethanol-preferring rats drank significantly greater amount of phenazepam solution than those not preferring ethanol. Intraperitoneal administration of phenazepam and ethanol eliminated differences between the animals of the two groups in consumption of each substance but had no cross effect.", 
    "20": "Antipsychotics selectively disrupt relatively weak responses maintained by conditioned stimuli compared with stronger responses maintained by unconditioned stimuli. The present study describes an easily taught and rapidly acquired (within one 15-trial session) one-way conditioned avoidance procedure for rats suitable for screening of drugs for potential antipsychotic activity. This was achieved by using an easily acquired response (running, part of the species-specific defense reaction repertoire), a clearly discriminated conditioned stimulus and determination of the appropriate strength of the unconditioned stimulus (i.e. shock level) for this procedure. Behavior acquired under these described conditions resulted in stable performance over long retest periods. By using either a low or high intensity of shock level under which the animals were trained and tested, the difference between the dose of haloperidol and chlorpromazine able to disrupt avoidance and that which disrupted escape response rates was increased. This effect was also observed for morphine, which inhibited both avoidance and escape responses at similar dose levels only under low shock conditions. At a high shock condition morphine more selectively inhibited avoidance responding. Diazepam did not affect avoidance behavior under the conditions described here.", 
    "21": "The authors review recent progress in the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders. Most research within the last five years has focused on panic disorder; the findings include support for the usefulness of imipramine and clomipramine and probably other agents; evidence that the benzodiazepines alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam are approximately equally effective as antipanic agents; and high variability in relapse rates after discontinuation of drug treatment. Further work is required to determine whether buspirone and other forthcoming serotonin agonist drugs have a role in treating panic disorder and other anxiety disorders. For generalized anxiety disorder, scientific studies do not support the effectiveness of beta blocker; tricyclics may be potentially useful. Psychopharmacological treatments for social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are also reviewed.", 
    "22": "Thirty-three patients, operated on between 1981 and 1986, and presenting post-operative confusion and restlessness are analyzed. Two groups are identified: group 1 are patients who regularly received BZD before their present hospitalization; in group 2 patients were given high-dose BZD in the early postoperative period. Symptoms were anxiousness in 15 patients, restlessness in 14, myoclonia in 14, delirium in 3, coma and seizures in 1. BZD withdrawal syndrome was considered after the other causes of post-operative agitation were eliminated and the diagnosis was confirmed by the administration of BZD that relieved the symptoms and by the plasmatic concentration of BZD. This syndrome appears 1 to 5 days after BZD withdrawal and severity of symptoms seems to be directly proportional to the doses and duration of BZD therapy. Propranolol was proposed to reduce the intensity of the symptoms. Nevertheless, progressive withdrawal of BZD remains the best way for managing such patients.", 
    "23": "Ninety day-case or short stay patients were allocated to three groups in a double-blind study. The groups received oral midazolam 15 mg, oral temazepam 20 mg or placebo approximately 1 h before surgery. Midazolam was superior to temazepam regarding anxiolysis, sedation and amnesia, but temazepam was superior to placebo. However, delay in immediate and late recovery occurred significantly more often in the patients receiving midazolam than in those receiving temazepam or placebo.", 
    "24": "Experiments in vivo and in vitro on 90 rats were made to study the influence of 1,4-benzodiazepine tranquilizers (phenazepam, nitrazepam and diazepam) on cerebral xanthine oxidase activity. Phenazepam, nitrazepam and diazepam in the dose of 5 mg per 200 g bw were shown to reduce xanthine oxidase activity by 80.4%, 64.3% and 55.8%, respectively 2 h after intraperitoneal injection. 6 h after the injection of benzodiazepines the enzyme activity grows, but control values are achieved only after nitrazepam injection. In vitro experiments revealed direct influence of the tranquilizers on xanthine oxidase. Phenazepam inhibits xanthine oxidase activity in concentration as long as 10(-10) M (to 36.6%), and practically completely in 10(-6) M concentration. Nitrazepam and diazepam inhibit xanthine oxidase activity within concentration range between 10(-8) M (to 51.5% and 33.2%, respectively), and 10(-4) M (practically completely). The inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity is shown to be caused by the competition between hypoxanthine, the reaction substrate, and tranquilizer, to bind with the active site of the enzyme.", 
    "25": "A prospective study of risk factors for falls in the elderly at home was conducted in a cohort of tenants (N = 169) of six senior-citizen buildings in New Jersey. Within this study, we evaluated whether benzodiazepine sedative use was associated with risk of falling. The mean age (+/- SD) of the cohort was 79.8 +/- 7.3 years, and 80% were women. Monthly telephone interviews yielded a total of 77 falls during an average follow-up time of 5.6 months. Benzodiazepine use at baseline was categorized as either none, as needed, or continuous, eg, nightly use. Continuous use appeared to increase the risk of falling in this cohort (unadjusted relative risk [RR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval = 0.93, 2.52; RR adjusted for age, gender, and follow-up time = 1.82, 95% confidence interval = 0.92, 3.62). Any use of benzodiazepines was related to multiple falls in persons who fell. The risk of falling from continuous benzodiazepine use may be higher in persons with position-sense loss in the toes (RR = 2.00) than in persons without such loss (RR = 1.35). We suggest that periodic review of the need for benzodiazepines in the elderly be made.", 
    "26": "In their own practices and in consultation, requests to psychiatrists to evaluate and treat sleep disorders in the elderly are common. The five million elders in this country receive 35%-40% of the sedative-hypnotics prescribed, despite the fact that they represent only 12% of the population. Since their sleep disturbances are usually secondary to medical, psychiatric, pharmacologic, or environmental causes, they should receive a thorough evaluation and differential diagnostic approach. Before prescribing a sedative-hypnotic, one should consider nonpharmacologic interventions and education about normal sleep changes due to aging. As a foundation for the judicious prescribing of sedative-hypnotics, the pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging are discussed.", 
    "27": "The benzodiazepine clonazepam was approved for the treatment of epilepsy in 1976. To study its use in acute mania, the author compared clonazepam with lithium in a crossover trial. Clonazepam proved more effective than lithium in controlling the symptoms of mania and caused fewer manifestations of parkinsonism. Associated side effects included ataxia, drowsiness, and behavioral changes. No treatment-emergent depression was observed. Neither clonazepam nor any other benzodiazepine is recommended in schizoaffective or schizophrenic disorders because of the high risk of dependence in those patients, in contrast to manic-depressives. For the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, lithium is recommended as the initial agent, with L-tryptophan added if concomitant medication is needed. Clonazepam can then be added as the anticonvulsant, if necessary. In the treatment of acute mania, clonazepam is recommended for the first week of treatment, and lithium is added in the beginning of the second week, thus avoiding the use of neuroleptics.", 
    "28": "Meprobamate use was studied in an ambulatory elderly population in Dunedin, Florida. All participants taking this medication were mailed a questionnaire concerning their pattern of use. From 2,278 subjects, 30 (1.3%) reported the use of this drug. The average age of participants using this drug was 81.3 years. Five participants began using the drug over 27 years ago and over one-half of the respondents reported using the drug on a regular basis for over 10 years. With this type of history of meprobamate use, one might expect to encounter a large number of patients in the future who, in a similar manner, have been using benzodiazepines for many decades.", 
    "29": "Biochemical and immunological studies indicate that the GABAA receptor contains at least two types of subunit. Here we report that coexpression of two GABAA receptor subunit clones (alpha and beta) in Xenopus oocytes yields receptors with many biophysical properties of native GABAA receptors. These include ion selectivity, multiple single-channel conductance states, voltage-dependent gating and rectification, and complex desensitization kinetics. Furthermore, the receptors are competitively inhibited by bicuculline and display the expected allosteric and agonist effects of the barbiturate pentobarbital. The expressed receptors, however, appear to be activated by one molecule of GABA instead of two and fail to show potentiation by benzodiazepines. This implies that an additional factor(s) or subunit(s) is required for the reconstitution of a fully functional GABAA receptor.",

The compounds were tested in vitro for inhibition of the specific binding of 3H-Diazepam to benzodiazepine receptors in preparations of membranes from rat brain synaptosomes. None of the compounds was notably active in this test.", 
    "31": "Ethanol potentiates GABA-receptor-mediated Cl- ion flux in vitro and, at similar concentrations, has anxiolytic and intoxicating properties in vivo. The imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-meth-6-oxo-4H- imidazo(1,5-a)(1,4)benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate), is a potent partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor which can antagonize the in vitro actions of ethanol in potentiating GABA receptor-mediated Cl- ion flux. Moreover, several of the behavioral effects of ethanol are also antagonized by Ro 15-4513, and these effects can be demonstrated in several paradigms at doses of Ro 15-4513 that do not produce opposite behavioral effects. In contrast, in our studies, other benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and inverse agonists, including Ro 15-1788, FG-7142, and beta-CCE were not able to antagonize these biochemical or behavioral effects of ethanol at doses that were without intrinsic effects. However, both Ro 15-1788 and beta-CCE blocked the antagonism of ethanol's effects by Ro 15-4513, suggesting a role for the GABA receptor complex in the actions of ethanol. These studies provide further evidence that GABAergic neurones may mediate at least some of the behavioral and biochemical actions of low-to-moderate doses of ethanol.", 
    "32": "The ability of benzodiazepine receptor ligands to modify the behavioral effects of ethanol in tests of exploration, locomotion and anxiety are reviewed. Drugs with inverse agonist activity appear capable of consistently antagonizing the reductions in exploration and anxiety caused by ethanol. In contrast, the locomotor stimulant action of ethanol has appeared relatively insensitive to inverse agonists, suggesting that this effect may not be mediated primarily by an action of ethanol at the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex.", 
    "33": "The ability of various benzodiazepine receptor ligands to antagonize the anticonvulsant action of ethanol was investigated using intravenous infusion of the GABA antagonist bicuculline. The partial inverse agonists FG 7142, RO 15-4513 and RO 15-3505 produced dose-related reductions in seizure threshold. These compounds also partially reversed the anticonvulsant action of ethanol. However, the magnitude of the effects in each case was only equivalent to the reduction in seizure threshold caused by each compound when administered alone. This is the proconvulsant effect of each compound merely subtracted from the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol. ZK 93426, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist which alone failed to alter seizure threshold, did not affect the anticonvulsant action of ethanol. Both RO 15-4513 and RO 15-3505 also lowered the seizure threshold of barbiturate-treated mice, again in a subtractive fashion. The ability of RO 15-4513 and other inverse agonists to antagonize the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol appears to result from their intrinsic proconvulsant properties.", 
    "34": "The imidazobenzodiazepinone derivative Ro 15-4513 has the activity profile of a partial inverse (low efficacy) agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR). It reverses central nervous depressant effects of diazepam, and, in part, of phenobarbitone and ethanol in mice, rats and cats in behavioural, electrophysiological, and neurochemical paradigms. The interaction of Ro 15-4513 with barbiturates and ethanol is due to its inverse agonistic (negative allosteric modulatory) property at the BZR, as it was reversed by the selective BZR blocker flumazenil (Ro 15-1788). In the present experiment situations, other BZR partial inverse agonists in subconvulsant or overt convulsant doses were less effective against ethanol effects than Ro 15-4513. Possible mechanisms for this differential activity of BZR inverse agonists are discussed.", 
    "35": "Ethanol at low doses produces a release of punished responding in an operant rat conflict test similar to that observed for benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. It has been hypothesized that these anti-punishment effects are mediated via the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex but not at the benzodiazepine binding site. In the present study isopropylbicyclophosphate (IPPO), which binds at the picrotoxinin site, reversed the release of punished responding produced by ethanol, pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide; at low doses IPPO (less than 10 micrograms/kg) appeared to be most effective against ethanol but at higher doses (greater than 15 micrograms/kg) was also effective against pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide. At still higher doses IPPO produced a decrease in punished and unpunished responding. These results suggest that the \"anxiolytic\" actions of ethanol may involve a direct action on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex and this action may underlie some of the intoxicating effects of ethanol.", 
    "36": "In experiments on mice by the method of conditioned reaction of passive avoidance and amnesia elicited by the animal delay in the dangerous compartment immediately after electrocutaneous stimulation, antiamnestic effect is demonstrated of pharmacological influences, changing the activity of benzodiazepine-GABA-ionophore complex and dopaminergic system. Comparative analysis of the efficiency of neuropharmacological substances of different actions on synaptic apparatus of the studied transmitter systems in amnesia reduction showed that the greatest effect of improving the reproduction of the conditioned habit was that of the bupropion, the highly specific blockator of dopamine reverse absorption. The obtained results testify that amnesia development is based on activation of the inhibitory GABAergic brain processes and disturbance of dopaminergic system functioning.", 
    "37": "Histamine (HA) is synthesized from L-histidine by histidine decarboxylase (HDC), and HA released from neurons is predominantly methylated to tele-methylhistamine (t-MH), which is further metabolized by MAO. Therefore, the HA turnover rate is determined by either a exponential decrease in HA level after treatment with alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (alpha-FMH), a specific HDC inhibitor, or a linear accumulation of t-MH after pargyline treatment. Brain HA and t-MH can be simultaneously assayed using HPLC with fluorometric detection. Care should be given to avoid the contamination by extraencephalic mast-cell HA after microwave irradiation or immersion in liquid nitrogen, and to a marked circadian variation of t-MH level. The HA turnover is the highest in the hypothalamus, low in the pons-medulla oblongata and cerebellum, and nil in the spinal cord in rats, mice and guinea pigs. The half-life of neuronal HA is 8-87 min in various brain regions of these animals. Barbiturates, enflurane, benzodiazepines, GABA-mimetic drugs, ethanol and delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol significantly decrease the HA turnover, whereas mu-opioid agonists such as morphine and [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly(ol)5] enkephalin enhance it. Foot-shock and phencyclidine also enhance it at least partly via mu-opioid receptors. Chlorpromazine, haloperidol, imipramine, methamphetamine or halothane have no influence on the HA turnover.", 
    "38": "The effect of i.p. administration of kappa-opioid receptor agonists, bremazocine, tifluadom and U-50,488H on morphine (8 mg/kg i.p.)-induced analgesia in morphine-naive and morphine tolerant male Sprague-Dawley rats was determined using the tail-flick test. The tolerance to morphine in the rats was induced by s.c., implantation of six morphine pellets during a 7-day period. Implantation of morphine pellets resulted in the development of tolerance as evidenced by the decrease in the analgesic response to morphine when compared to placebo pellets implanted rats. Bremazocine (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) and U-50,488H (16 mg/kg) antagonized morphine-induced analgesia in morphine-naive rats while tifluadom (8 and 16 mg/kg) potentiated the effect. In morphine-tolerant rats, bremazocine (3 mg/kg) and U-50,488H (16 mg/kg) potentiated morphine-induced analgesia. Tifluadom at any of the doses had no effect on morphine-induced analgesia in morphine-tolerant rats. These results provide evidence that different kappa-opioid agonists modify morphine-induced analgesia differentially in morphine-naive and morphine-tolerant rats.", 
    "39": "The interaction of beta-CMC, an amino beta-carboline recently described as a selective antagonist of the sedative effect of diazepam, with zolpidem, an imidazopyridine hypnotic, which like beta-CMC binds preferentially to the omega 1 (BZ-1) site of the GABA benzodiazepine chloride channel receptor complex, was investigated. In mice, beta-CMC antagonized the effect of zolpidem against isoniazid-induced convulsions without affecting its activity against convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole or electroshock. beta-CMC also antagonized the decrease in locomotor activity and the impairment in muscle strength provoked by zolpidem. In rats trained to discriminate zolpidem, beta-CMC antagonized both the interoceptive stimulus and the decrease in the rate of lever pressing produced by zolpidem. This selective antagonism, inhibition of effects of zolpidem exerted by low doses (locomotor activity and isoniazid-induced convulsions) as well as effects produced by high doses (muscle strength) but not those provoked by intermediate doses (pentylenetetrazole and electroshock-induced convulsions), could not be explained by a receptor occupancy hypothesis. These results suggest that the anticonvulsant and sedative effects of zolpidem do not involve the same receptor subtype and that the hypnoselective properties of zolpidem may be linked to its selectivity for the omega 1 (BZ-1) site of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "40": "The influence of alpha-chymotrypsin and diazepam on the phasic (mainly direct) and tonic (indirect, probably substance P-mediated) components of intestinal cholinergic contractions, induced by the GABA-A receptor agonist 3-aminopropane sulphonic acid (3-APS), was investigated in the guinea-pig ileum. alpha-Chymotrypsin, at a concentration (20 U/ml) not affecting submaximal Ach (0.1 microM) contractions, preferentially depressed the tonic component of the 3-APS (30 microM)-induced response. A brief exposure (10 or 60 sec) to diazepam (0.1 microM) potentiated both the phasic and the tonic contractions evoked by low (10, 30 microM) 3-APS concentrations. This potentiation was prevented by bicuculline (30 microM), hyoscine (1 microM) and flumazenil (1, 3 microM). These results provide further support for an involvement of a peptide neurotransmitter on GABA-A receptor-mediated cholinergic response in the ileum. The modulation of this response by diazepam is probably exerted through recognition sites resembling the \"central type\" benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "41": "The effects of endogenous and synthetic peptides containing GABA or its analogues on the GABA/benzodiazepine/chloride ionophore complex. GABAB receptor, Cl fluxes, GABA release and GABA uptake were studied using synaptic membranes, crude synaptoneurosomal preparations and slices prepared from the rat and mouse brain. The sodium-independent binding of GABA was strongly inhibited by GABA-histidine, followed by gamma-glutamyl-homotaurine, GABA-glycine and gamma-glutamyl-GABA. The binding of diazepam was slightly enhanced by the same peptides. The peptides alone had no effect on the chloride fluxes, but GABA-histidine, gamma-glutamyl-GABA and GABA-glycine enhanced while gamma-glutamyl-homotaurine and GABA-taurine inhibited GABA-stimulated chloride uptake. GABA-histidine was the most effective displacer of baclofen binding, but gamma-glutamylhomotaurine was entirely ineffective. The uptake of GABA was markedly inhibited in synaptosomal preparations by GABA-histidine, while all other peptides were less effective. gamma-Glutamyl-taurine attenuated but gamma-glutamyl-homotaurine and GABA-glycine enhanced the potassium-stimulated release of GABA. The present actions of GABA-histidine in vitro may be of significance for GABAergic neurotransmission in vivo.", 
    "42": "Certain 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were prepared and tested for their ability to displace [3H]diazepam from bovine brain membranes. From these compounds, the quinolytriazole derivatives (14, 15, 16, 17) were clearly the most potent, while the naphthyl- and the naphthyridyl-triazoles were considerably less active. The p-nitrophenyl derivative (15) was the compound that bound with the highest affinity within the quinolyltriazole compounds class. The replacement of the p-nitrophenyl group with other substituents greatly decreased the binding activity. From a Lineweaver-Burk analysis of 11, it appears that the inhibition is competitive.", 
    "43": "The activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as presynaptic markers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and acetylcholine (ACh)-containing neurons, and the binding of [3H]muscimol and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) as postsynaptic ones were measured in autopsied samples of the caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, substantia nigra and the cerebral cortex from L-dopa-treated patients with Stage V (terminally bedridden) patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). In PD, GAD activities were significantly reduced in the caudate nucleus and substantia nigra relative to normal controls, but were normal when the values from protracted terminal illness (PTI) cases were used as the controls. ChAT activities were reduced in all regions studied. These reductions in GAD and ChAT activities were not accompanied by a concomitant increase in the density of GABAA or muscarinic receptors. GABAA receptor densities were significantly decreased in both the cortical and subcortical brain regions, while muscarinic receptor densities remained unchanged. We suggest that the decreased density of GABAA receptor in PD brains reflects degeneration of neurons on which the receptor is localized, i.e., degeneration of ascending monoaminergic neurons including nigral dopamine (DA) neurons.", 
    "44": "A series of experiments was performed to examine the effects of two benzodiazepine antagonists, flumazenil and ZK 93426, on the behavioral changes caused by ethanol (2 g/kg) in a holeboard test. The interaction between ethanol and low doses of diazepam (0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg) was also investigated. Both flumazenil and ZK 93426 reversed the reduction in exploration caused by ethanol, but tended to increase exploration when administered alone. In contrast, diazepam, which also increased exploration alone, tended to enhance the reduction in exploration caused by ethanol. Diazepam reduced the motor stimulant action of ethanol. The partial reversal by the two antagonists of the reduction in exploration caused by ethanol was not due to alterations in blood ethanol concentrations but may have resulted from their intrinsic exploration-increasing effects or an antagonism of an endogenous ligand for central benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "45": "Changes in cyclic AMP concentrations were studied in intact PC12 pheochromocytoma cells exposed to a variety of treatments. A marked increase was triggered by N-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, the activator of an adenosine receptor, whereas a decrease (observed even after phosphodiesterase blockade) was induced by carbachol, working through a muscarinic receptor inhibited by the selective muscarinic blocker pirenzepine, only at high concentration (Ki 450 nM). A decrease in cyclic AMP was also induced by clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic-receptor agonist. Both the alpha 2-adrenergic and the muscarinic inhibitions were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, and were unaffected by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. The latter drug caused a decrease in the resting cyclic AMP concentrations, and a potentiation of the increase induced by adenosine-receptor activation. Except for clonidine, all these treatments were found to be effective in both growing PC12 cells and, although to a smaller degree, in cells that had stopped growing and had acquired a neuron-like phenotype after prolonged treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF). Neither forskolin (a direct activator of adenylate cyclase) nor the activation of adenosine and alpha-adrenergic receptors was able to modify the resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i in PC12 cells. Likewise, the K+-induced [Ca2+]i transients were unchanged after these treatments, whereas the transients induced by carbachol through the activation of a muscarinic receptor highly sensitive to pirenzepine were moderately potentiated by forskolin (and, to a lesser degree, by the adenosine analogue) and attenuated by clonidine. These results characterize in further detail the spectrum and the mutual interrelationships of the intracellular signals induced by receptor activation in PC12 cells, also as a function of the NGF-induced differentiation.", 
    "46": "1. The effects of the general anaesthetic 2,6-diisopropylphenol (DIP) on synaptic transmission and the actions of amino acid transmitter candidates have been investigated in rat olfactory cortex slices. 2. On electrical stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), DIP (20 to 200 microM) increased the area of those surface field potentials which reflect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated transmission in a concentration-dependent manner in 6 out of 12 slices. In a series of conditioning experiments, DIP (50 microM) also potentiated GABA-mediated pre- and post-synaptic inhibition. 3. Perfusion of slices with DIP (50 microM) potentiated the reduction in the excitability of the terminals of the LOT produced by exogenous GABA in a picrotoxin-sensitive manner. 4. DIP (50 microM) markedly potentiated the surface depolarizations evoked by GABA, muscimol and 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid. The effect on the response to 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid was observed over a concentration range of DIP of 6.25 to 50 microM and was not blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. 5. In slices in which GABA-mediated transmission was abolished by picrotoxin (25 microM), DIP (50 microM) had no significant effect on monosynaptically-evoked excitatory transmission but depressed the areas of those field potentials which reflect di-/polysynaptic excitations in a concentration-dependent manner (from between 1.6 and 6.25 to 50 microM). 6. In a series of conditioning experiments DIP (50 microM) abolished the increase in the excitability of the pyramidal cells evoked on stimulation of deep association fibres. 7. DIP (50 microM) had no significant effect on surface depolarizations evoked by N-methyl-D-aspartate, quisqualate and kainate or by the transmitter candidates L-glutamate and L-aspartate. 8. It is concluded that, at clinically relevant concentrations, DIP potentiates GABA-mediated transmission probably by an interaction with the GABA receptor complex and inhibits di-/polysynaptic excitations, possibly by inhibiting the release of excitatory transmitters.", 
    "47": "Following prolonged treatment (7 days) with diazepam (10 mg/kg/day, using ALZET mini-osmotic pumps) in rats, the function of adenosine receptors was assessed in specific structures of the brain, using both agonist ligand binding and adenylate cyclase assays. Binding to A1 receptors was quantified using [3H]N6-[(R)-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl] adenosine, a selective ligand at A1 receptors. Differences in the binding of this ligand and that of [3H]5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine, which binds to both A1 and A2 subtypes of receptors with similar affinities, were used to quantify A2 receptors. Treatment with diazepam failed to alter the binding of [3H]N6-[(R)-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl] adenosine in all areas of the brain studied. However, the binding of A2 receptors and A2 receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate-cyclase were significantly attenuated in striatal membranes from diazepam-treated rats. Thus, the present study indicated that functional adenosine A2 receptors were desensitized after prolonged treatment with diazepam, since decreased agonist binding to A2 receptors paralleled an attenuation in the stimulation by adenosine of the activity of adenylate cyclase, an effect mediated by the A2 receptor. These results further indicate that the changes in adenosine A2 receptors correlated with significant short-lasting alterations in the sleep-wake cycle during the withdrawal of diazepam. The alterations in sleep-wakefulness did not correlate with the effect of diazepam on benzodiazepine receptors since no changes were observed in the binding of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "48": "Effects of atropine or diazepam pretreatment on soman-induced convulsions and brain phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism, as assessed by brain regional inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) levels, were studied in saline and LiCl-pretreated rats. IP1, an intermediate in PI turnover, was measured in cortex, caudate, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Soman (100 micrograms/kg; sc) produced convulsions in 63% of the saline-pretreated rats, whereas with LiCl pretreatment all rats exposed to 100 micrograms/kg of soman had tonic-clonic convulsions. Thus, LiCl pretreatment potentiated soman-induced convulsions. Tissue IP1 increased severalfold in soman-exposed convulsing rats with the highest increases being in frontal cortex and caudate. In contrast, no marked increases of IP1 occurred in similarly treated nonconvulsing rats. LiCl treatment itself increased IP1 levels without causing convulsions. In LiCl-pretreated rats, soman again markedly elevated IP1 levels above LiCl alone in convulsing rats, whereas no such effect occurred in nonconvulsing rats. In LiCl-pretreated rats, the increased IP1 levels associated with soman-induced convulsions were greatest in hippocampus and piriform cortex. Thus, LiCl appears to lower the threshold for the spread of seizure activity through limbic structures, thereby potentiating cholinergic-induced convulsions. Diazepam and atropine both blocked soman-induced convulsions, and brain regional IP1 elevations were concomitantly abolished as well. These results indicate that soman-induced convulsions involve the inositol lipid signaling system. This involvement is potentiated by lithium but attenuated by atropine and diazepam.", 
    "49": "Two isomeric iodinated analogues of the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site (PBS) ligand Ro5-4864 have been synthesized and labeled in high specific activity with iodine-125. Competitive binding assays conducted with the unlabeled analogues indicate high affinity for PBS. Tissue biodistribution studies in rats with these 125I-labeled ligands indicate high uptake of radioactivity in the adrenals, heart, and kidney--tissues known to have high concentrations of PBS. Preadministration of the potent PBS antagonist PK 11195 blocked in vivo uptake in adrenal tissue by over 75%, but to a lesser degree in other normal tissues. In vivo binding autoradiography in brain conducted in C6 glioma bearing rats showed dense, PBS-mediated accumulation of radioactivity in the tumor. Ligand 6 labeled with 123I may have potential for scintigraphic localization of intracranial glioma.", 
    "50": "A human cDNA clone containing the 5' coding region of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor alpha subunit was used to quantify and visualize receptor mRNA in various regions of the rat brain. Using a [32P]CTP-labelled antisense RNA probe (860 bases) prepared from the alpha subunit cDNA, multiple mRNA species were detected in Northern blots using total and poly A rat brain RNA. In all brain regions, mRNAs of 4.4 and 4.8 kb were observed, and an additional mRNA of 3.0 kb was detected in the cerebellum and hippocampus. The level of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor mRNA was highest in the cerebellum followed by the thalamus = frontal cortex = hippocampus = parietal cortex = hypothalamus much greater than pons = striatum = medulla. In situ hybridization revealed high levels of alpha subunit mRNA in cerebellar gray matter, olfactory bulb, thalamus, hippocampus/dentate gyrus, and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These data suggest the presence of multiple GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor alpha subunit mRNAs in rat brain and demonstrate the feasibility of studying the expression of genes encoding the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor after pharmacological and/or environmental manipulation.", 
    "51": "The effect of administration of thyroid hormones on central benzodiazepine receptors was investigated using neuron-enriched primary cultures obtained from the neopallium of 16-day-old embryonic rats. Addition of L-triiodothyronine for 3 days decreased the maximal number of benzodiazepine receptor binding sites without any change in affinity at 10(-5) and 10(-6) M. L-Thyroxine administered for 3 days had the same effect at 10(-5) M. No significant change was observed over periods of less than 3 days, a finding indicating that this inhibition was not a direct in vitro effect. This down-regulation seems to be a direct modulatory effect of thyroid hormones on cerebral cortical neurons. Addition for 3 days of D-thyroxine and D-triiodothyronine, which are physiologically inactive isomers of the thyroid hormones, did not induce any significant alterations in benzodiazepine receptors. The decrease in number of cerebral cortical neuronal benzodiazepine receptors due to L-isomers of thyroid hormones may be related to the convulsions and anxiety observed in thyrotoxicosis in humans.", 
    "52": "The effect of omega (benzodiazepine)-receptor agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists on the electrically evoked release of 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) was studied in superfused slices of the rat frontal cerebral cortex. The electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT was enhanced by nanomolar concentrations of diazepam and the selective omega 1-receptor agonists alpidem and CL 218872. The omega 1/omega 2- and omega 1-receptor antagonists flumazenil and CGS 8216, respectively, did not modify the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT. The omega 3-receptor agonist Ro 5-4864 and the omega 1-receptor inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate on their own did not affect the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT. On the other hand, the inverse agonist 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (DMCM), at micromolar concentrations, inhibited both the spontaneous and the evoked release of [3H]5-HT. The facilitation of the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT by diazepam, alpidem, or CL 218872 was potentiated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Exposure to flumazenil and CGS 8216 antagonized the facilitation by diazepam, alpidem, or CL 218872 of [3H]5-HT release. The inhibition of the release of [3H]5-HT by DMCM was not modified by exposure to either flumazenil, CGS 8216, or GABA. The inhibitory effect of DMCM was not observed when monoamine oxidase activity was inhibited by pargyline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The postnatal development of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors has been studied in frontal cortex, cerebellum, striatum, and hypothalamus of the rat after prenatal and perinatal exposure to diazepam. Dams were injected subcutaneously with single daily doses of 1 mg of diazepam/kg from day 7 to 20 of gestation or from day 15 of gestation to day 6 after birth. Prenatal exposure had no effect on litter size or length of gestation or on the postnatal development of body and brain weights of the progeny. However, a reduced mortality of the pups was observed in relation to vehicle-treated controls until postnatal day 10. Prenatal diazepam administration decreased [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in frontal cortex, striatum, and hypothalamus but not in cerebellum. This decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor binding was due to a decrease in receptor density rather than in receptor affinity. In contrast, perinatal diazepam exposure led to a transient decrease in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding limited to the frontal cortex. The permanent reduction in number of beta-adrenergic receptors, which depends on the scaling and duration of the drug application period, points to the necessity of a prolonged evaluation of effects of exposure to psychotropic drugs in early stages of brain development.", 
    "54": "1. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) was applied by the 'concentration clamp' technique to isolated neurones of Aplysia. GABA induced a chloride current (ICl) due to activation of a single class of chloride-channel. 2. The concentration-response curve for the peak ICl gave an apparent dissociation constant of 6.4 X 10(-5) M and a Hill coefficient of 0.88. The current-voltage relationship was linear in the voltage range examined (-40 to +10 mV). 3. The activation phase of the ICl could be fitted to a single exponential function and desensitization followed the sum of two exponential functions. The time constants of activation and desensitization decreased with increasing concentrations of GABA but were voltage-independent. The recovery process from desensitization also followed the sum of two exponential functions. 4. As for the rate-limiting step of the channel activation, the hyperbolic relationship between the activation rate and GABA concentration showed that the rapid binding assumption holds, suggesting that the isomerization step is rate-limiting. The apparent channel closing rate constant was estimated to be 10 s-1 from the ordinate intercept of the linear part of the above relationship at lower concentrations. 5. Muscimol and beta-alanine induced a ICl, which cross-desensitized with that evoked by GABA. The GABA-ICl was not enhanced by diazepam (10(-6) M) or alpha-chloralose (10(-3) M), in fact depressant effects were evident. 6. Pentobarbitone decreased the GABA-ICl non-competitively without altering activation or desensitization kinetics. The concentration-inhibition curve gave a KD value of 8.9 x 10(-5) M and a Hill coefficient of 1.0. 7. These results suggest that GABA activates a single class of Cl channel in Aplysia neurones, which have one binding site for the agonist. The GABA receptor-Cl channel complex in Aplysia is pharmacologically and perhaps structurally different from that in vertebrates.", 
    "55": "The effect of cholinergic blockade with pirenzepine or atropine on growth hormone (GH) release after galanin administration was investigated in five normal male subjects. The mean peak GH response to an infusion of galanin (40 pmol/kg/min for 40 minutes) was significantly reduced from 17.2 mU/L to 2.9 mU/L (P less than .001) with prior administration of pirenzepine (30 mg IV). When galanin was infused at a higher dose (80 pmol/kg/min), this suppression of release by pirenzepine was partially overcome, with GH rising to a mean peak response of 8.0 mU/L (P less than .05). Repeated administration of atropine (two bolus doses of 0.6 mg IV) also failed to abolish the GH response to this higher dose of galanin in two subjects. It has been proposed that cholinergic pathways control GH release via somatostatin, and this study suggests that galanin may also act by modulating hypothalamic somatostatinergic tone either directly or by facilitating cholinergic transmission.", 
    "56": "Inhalation anesthetics, such as diethyl ether, halothane, and enflurane, increase 36Cl- uptake into rat cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes in a concentration-dependent, picrotoxin-sensitive fashion. At concentrations consistent with those that stimulate 36Cl- uptake, inhalation anesthetics also inhibit the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) to well-washed cortical membranes. Scatchard analysis of [35S]TBPS binding indicates that these agents reduce the apparent affinity of this radioligand and have little effect on the Bmax. The ability of inhalation anesthetics to directly stimulate 36Cl- uptake and inhibit [35S]TBPS binding is a property shared by nonvolatile anesthetics. Nonetheless, there are differences between nonvolatile agents (such as barbiturates and alcohols) and inhalation anesthetics, because the former compounds augment muscimol (a GABAmimetic) stimulated 36Cl- uptake, whereas the latter group (such as ether and enflurane) inhibit this effect. These findings demonstrate that therapeutically relevant concentrations of inhalation anesthetics perturb the benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor chloride channel complex, and suggest this oligomeric protein may be a common mediator of some aspects of anesthetic action.", 
    "57": "A cDNA clone of an alpha subunit of the human GABA-A receptor has been isolated. The human clone (pCLL800) contains 1055 nucleotides in an open reading frame and 260 nucleotides in the 5' non-coding region. The 351 amino acid sequence of this human alpha subunit shows 97% homology with its bovine counterpart. Hybridization of pCLL800 to Northern blots shows a 3.9/4.3 Kb RNA doublet in human cortex, rat whole brain, cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, olfactory bulb and cerebellum. Developmental studies show that the levels of the rat alpha mRNA increase between one and three weeks of age in a manner similar to the development of the benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "58": "The effects of Ro 15-4513, FG 7142 and beta-CCM on the activity of the mesocortical dopaminergic system were examined by measuring the changes in the content of the principal dopamine (DA) metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the prefrontal cortex of the rat. Ro 15-4513 increased the DOPAC content in the prefrontal cortex in a dose-dependent manner (5-40 mg/kg i.p.) but had no effect on DA concentrations. A similar increase in DOPAC content was induced by FG 7142 (40 mg/kg i.p.) and beta-CCM (8 mg/kg s.c.), two beta-carboline derivatives that interact with benzodiazepine recognition sites as partial inverse agonists. These effects of Ro 15-4513, FG 7142 and beta-CCM on DA metabolism in the prefrontal cortex are mediated via benzodiazepine recognition sites, since they were prevented by the administration of the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 and ZK 93426. These data indicate that Ro 15-4513 is an inverse agonist at benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "59": "A comparison has been made between [3H]pirenzepine binding to the M1 receptor population of rat cerebral cortex and [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding to M2 receptors in rat cardiac membranes. Several standard muscarinic antagonists including trihexyphenidyl HCl, benztropine, biperidin and 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide) showed some selectivity for the M1 binding assay. Dicyclomine and hexahydrosiladifenidol were the only antagonists with a selectivity approaching that of pirenzepine. Gallamine and AFDX-116 were the only M2 (cardiac) selective antagonists. Muscarinic agonists displayed profiles which could be classified into two groups, apparently related to their intrinsic activity. One group displayed apparent selectivity for the heart, with low Hill coefficients and contained full agonists such as acetylcholine. The second group displayed less selectivity, intermediate Hill coefficients and contained partial agonists such as pilocarpine. Thus muscarinic agents can distinguish between different tissues not only on the basis of receptor selectivity, but also by recognition of high and low agonist affinity states. Thus the intrinsic activity of a muscarinic agonist may reflect an apparent but not true receptor-mediated selectivity.", 
    "60": "Antral biopsies were obtained to detect Campylobacter pylori infection in 382 patients referred for gastroscopy. One hundred and seventy four patients (46%) were infected. Infection was strongly associated with histological gastritis (p less than 0.001), but there was no association between histological antral gastritis and the appearance of the gastric antrum during gastroscopy. Because it has been suggested that the lower relapse rate for duodenal ulcer following colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) is due to suppression of C pylori we investigated different formulations and dosing of CBS for their efficacy in clearing C pylori. Seventy four infected patients were prospectively assigned to therapy with pirenzepine (11 patients) or one of four regimens of CBS; one swallow tablet 4 times a day (11 patients); two swallow tablets twice daily (16 patients); two buffered swallow tablets twice daily (14 patients); or two chew tablets twice daily (22 patients). All patients treated with pirenzepine and one CBS swallow tablet 4 times a day were still infected after treatment. Infection was not detected in 16 patients taking twice daily doses of CBS; 8 (50%), 3 (21%) and 5 (23%) patients taking two standard, buffered or chew tabs twice daily respectively. Improvement of histological gastritis was observed only in those patients apparently cleared of C pylori (p less than 0.01) and this was due to a decrease in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Nine patients apparently cleared of the infection were rebiopsied 44-137 days following treatment and 6 (66%) were found again to be infected. This study suggests that suppression of C pylori may vary with the formulation and dosing of CBS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "There was a 25 and 27% reduction in the density of mouse brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors 18 and 24 h following a single injection of the organophosphate diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) when the muscarinic antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) was used as the ligand. Down-regulation of specific [3H]NMS binding was rapidly reversible reaching control levels 36 h after DFP administration. Carbamylcholine and pirenzepine competition for the specific binding of either [3H]NMS or [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) in brain homogenates from untreated and DFP-treated mice demonstrated that the alteration in muscarinic receptor density following acute DFP treatment was not accompanied by a change in a particular muscarinic receptor binding conformation. Furthermore, the magnitude of muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was unchanged following short-term DFP treatment suggesting that a physiological desensitization in this response does not accompany acute down-regulation of [3H]NMS binding sites.", 
    "62": "Benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by the full agonist, diazepam, and by the two putative partial agonists, Ro 16-6028 and Ro 17-1812, was measured by inhibition of in vivo [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in mouse brain and was correlated with their pharmacological effects. The anticonvulsant effects of Ro 16-6028, Ro 17-1812 and diazepam (ED50 values) appeared at receptor occupancies of 40, 20 and less than 5%, respectively. Moreover, at the highest measurable receptor occupancy (90-100%), Ro 16-6028 and Ro 17-1812 did not induce any rotarod deficit whereas a complete deficit was observed with diazepam at 35% receptor occupancy.", 
    "63": "Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) has been considered a major coordinator of the overall physical and behavioral response to stress. Moreover, prolonged hypersecretion of CRH has been implicated in the pathogenesis of disorders characterized by anxiety and/or depression. Drugs acting through the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine (GABA/BZD) receptor system have anxiolytic and/or antidepressant properties whereas benzodiazepine inverse agonists cause anxiety and stimulate the pituitary-adrenal axis in vivo. To examine the involvement of the GABA/BZD system in the regulation of hypothalamic CRH secretion, we studied the effects of various agonists and antagonists of GABAA and GABAB receptors using a sensitive rat hypothalamic organ culture with radioimmunoassayable CRH (IR-rCRH) as endpoint. The GABAA and GABAB receptor agonist GABA inhibited serotonin (5-HT)-induced IR-rCRH secretion from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M, but failed to do so at 10(-5) M. The GABAA receptor agonist muscimol was a weak inhibitor of 5-HT-induced IR-rCRH secretion, being effective only at the concentration of 10(-6) M. In contrast, the specific GABAB receptor agonist baclofen was able to inhibit 5-HT-induced IR-rCRH secretion from 10(-7) to 10(-5) M. The rank of potency was thus, GABA much greater than baclofen greater than muscimol. Bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, partially reversed the inhibitory effects of GABA. Diazepam, a classic benzodiazepine which interacts with the benzodiazepine-site of the GABAA receptor complex, inhibited 5-HT-induced IR-rCRH secretion from 3.3 X 10(-9) to 10(-5) M, an effect that could be reversed by the BZD inactive ligand Ro15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Excitatory amino acid receptors in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) are divided into 3 receptor subtypes: kainate, quisqualate, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). MK-801 is a selective, non-competitive antagonist of excitatory amino acid transmitters at the NMDA receptor site. The role of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission in electrical kindling was examined in animals stimulated daily in the amygdala following i.p. administration of low dosages of MK-801 (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg). A second experiment evaluated the anticonvulsant properties of MK-801 in rats kindled in the hippocampus and amygdala, and contrasted its efficacy with the antiepileptic agents, diazepam, phenobarbital and phenytoin, and the dissociative anesthetics phencyclidine and ketamine. MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) retarded the development of amygdala kindling and reduced mean AD duration over the first 10 stimulation sessions. The low dosage reduced total AD accrued during each kindling stage but failed to alter kindling rate. MK-801 blocked motor seizures induced by stimulation of hippocampal or amygdala kindled foci, but was more effective in reducing seizure severity and AD duration resulting from stimulation of the hippocampal focus. All other drugs tested, with the exception of phenytoin, protected against amygdaloid kindled seizures. It was concluded that excitatory amino acid transmission contributes in an important, but non-critical way to amygdala kindling.",

    "66": "The binding of the anti-tumor antibiotic anthramycin to a defined linear DNA fragment was investigated using both exonuclease III and lambda exonuclease. We show that most of the guanine residues are reactive toward anthramycin; however, several guanine residues showed preferential reactivity for the drug. Using purified UVRA, UVRB and UVRC proteins we present evidence that these three proteins in concert are able to recognize and produce specific strand cleavage flanking anthramycin-DNA adducts. The cleavage of anthramycin adducts by UVRABC nuclease is specific and results in strand breaks at five or six bases 5' and three or four bases 3'-flanking an adduct. At some guanine residues single incisions were observed only on one side of the adduct. The 5' strand breaks observed often occurred as doublet bands on sequencing gels, indicating plasticity in the site of 5' cleavage whereas the 3' cleavage did not show this effect. When DNA fragments modified with elevated levels of anthramycin were used as substrates the activity of the UVRABC nuclease toward the anthramycin adducts decreased. Possible mechanisms for the recognition and specific cleavage of the helix-stabilizing anthramycin DNA adduct and other helix destabilizing lesions by the UVRABC nuclease are discussed.", 
    "67": "We investigated the effects of benzodiazepine inverse agonists on ethanol-induced amnesia using a passive avoidance task. Pretraining treatment of mice with ethanol significantly impaired the passive avoidance response: there was a significant reduction in the % retention and step-down latency. The benzodiazepine inverse agonists, Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM, significantly increased the % retention and prolonged the step-down latencies in mice treated with ethanol, but FG 7142 did not. The anti-amnesic effects of Ro 15-4513 were completely antagonized by co-administration of Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist. These results suggest that the anti-amnesic effect of Ro 15-4513 on alcohol-induced amnesia is mediated by benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "68": "The effect of diazepam on ventricular automaticity induced by a local injury was investigated in the isolated right ventricle of the rat in the presence of the diazepam central antagonist, RO 15-1788, and of the adenosine antagonist, theophylline. Theophylline but not RO 15-1788 antagonized the inhibitory effect induced by diazepam on ventricular automaticity. The inhibitory effect of adenosine but not that of 2-chloroadenosine was potentiated in the presence of diazepam. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of diazepam on ventricular automaticity results from the inhibition of adenosine uptake.", 
    "69": "Binding of the isoquinoline PK 11195 and of the benzodiazepines Ro5-4864 and flunitrazepam was compared in glioma cells and tissues. In human and rat glioma cell cultures [3H]PK 11195 bound with higher affinity (Kd = 14.01 and 15.76 nM, respectively) than either Ro5-4864 (Ki = 1200 and 84.9 nM, respectively) or flunitrazepam (Ki greater than 10,000 and = 848 nM, respectively). Autoradiograms of postmortem human brain sections containing glioma revealed that [3H]PK 11195 bound specifically to intact tumor cells and not to cells of normal cerebral cortex or necrotic areas of the tumor. Total [3H]Ro5-4864 or [3H]flunitrazepam binding to these sections was indistinguishable from nonspecific binding, and regions of tumor and normal brain could not be delineated. These results support the use of radiolabeled PK 11195 for clinical trials of imaging human gliomas by positron emission tomography."
