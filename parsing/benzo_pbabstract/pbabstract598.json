Log-probit dose-response curves of the inhibitory effects of the anesthetics on the catecholamine releases induced by acetylcholine, nicotine, and muscarine were determined. Percentage inhibition by the anesthetics at clinically relevant concentrations were 98% of nicotine- and 31% of muscarine-induced releases by alphaxalone 2.6 microM, 76% of nicotine and 13% of muscarine by thiopental 23.9 microM, 86% of nicotine and no inhibition of muscarine by ketamine 17.0 microM, and no inhibition of either response by diazepam 5.0 microM. The ratio of IC50 (concentration for 50% inhibition), which was calculated by dividing IC50 for muscarine by IC50 for nicotine, showed a variety of values ranging from 3.9 for diazepam to 38.0 for ketamine. The results suggest that each anesthetic has characteristic selective inhibitory effects on nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic responses. The differing effects on the muscarinic responses might be one of the factors contributing to the characteristic properties of each anesthetic, whereas the inhibition of nicotinic responses might reflect a common property for many anesthetics.", 
    "1": "Fifteen patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were given midazolam 0.2 mg/kg iv over 15 s. All but one lost consciousness in a time ranging from 22-100 s (mean +/- SD was 55 +/- 26 s) after drug administration. Patients regained consciousness from 6-105 min (mean 53 +/- 32) after drug administration. The calculated mean plasma level of midazolam at arousal was 81 +/- 47 ng/ml. Pharmacokinetics parameters were determined from midazolam plasma levels measured in 16 consecutive venous blood samples. The pharmacokinetic parameters in CRF patients were compared with those of healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, and body size with the CRF patients. Protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis. CRF patients had a significantly higher (P less than 0.005) plasma-free drug fraction (6.5% +/- 0.7) compared with the control patients (3.9% +/- 0.1). Total (bound plus unbound) kinetics differed in the two groups: volume of distribution 3.8 +/- .3 1/kg in CRF patients versus 2.2 +/- .2 1/kg in controls (P less than 0.001), and clearance 11.4 +/- 1.6 ml X min-1 X kg-1 in CRF patients versus 6.7 +/- 0.9 ml X min-1 X kg-1 in controls (P less than 0.02). When kinetic parameters were corrected for protein binding, CRF patients unbound volume of distribution (63.5 +/- 6.8 1/kg) and free drug clearance (189 +/- 29 ml X min-1 X kg-1) were not different from the control group's volume of distribution (55.6 +/- 5.7 1/kg) and free drug clearance (176 +/- 24 ml X min-1 X kg-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine whose quick onset after intravenous injection, short duration of action, absence of venous irritation, and mild cardiovascular and respiratory effects suggest its use for induction of anesthesia. The renal effects of midazolam-N2O-O2 anesthesia, as determined by renal clearance of injected inulin and para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), in hydrated ASA Class I-II surgical patients (N = 8) were compared in a double-blind fashion with a similar group of patients (N = 9) anesthetized with thiopental-N2O-O2. Except for glomerular filtration rate, there were no significant changes in any of the measured variables (blood pressure, effective renal plasma flow, renal blood flow, and renal vascular resistance). The per cent reduction in glomerular filtration rate in patients given thiopental differed significantly from that in patients given midazolam. This study suggests that midazolam, as opposed to thiopental, offers minimal advantage in maintaining renal performance at least during the period of anesthetic administration.", 
    "3": "The relative effects of pretreatment with allyl alcohol and carbon tetrachloride on oxidative and glucuronide metabolism of lorazepam have been compared in the isolated perfused rat liver. Livers from rats pretreated for 24 hr with allyl alcohol (1.8 ml/kg, 1:50 solution, to induce pericentral hepatic necrosis), carbon tetrachloride (0.8 mg/kg in corn oil, to induce perivenular hepatic necrosis), or vehicle were perfused with 20% rat blood, 80% Krebs bicarbonate buffer at 20 ml/min. After 300 micrograms of lorazepam had been added to the reservoir, perfusate concentrations of lorazepam were measured in the perfusate at timed intervals. After 180 min, lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide were measured in perfusate, bile, and liver homogenate. Allyl alcohol and carbon tetrachloride lowered lorazepam clearance by 47% and 77%, respectively. Recovery of lorazepam glucuronide after 180 min was lowered by 35% by treatment with allyl alcohol and increased 73% by treatment with carbon tetrachloride. Glucuronide recovery permitted estimation of fractional glucuronide vs. nonglucuronide clearance. In control rats, glucuronide clearance accounted for 25% of total clearance. Allyl alcohol caused a 64% reduction in glucuronide clearance but only a 39% reduction in nonglucuronide clearance. In contrast, carbon tetrachloride caused a 60% reduction in glucuronide clearance but an 83% reduction in nonglucuronide clearance. The differences in ratios of the changes in glucuronide and nonglucuronide clearance provide further circumstantial evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis of predominant periportal localization of glucuronidation and pericentral localization of oxidative metabolism of lorazepam.", 
    "4": "Thirty men recently treated for alcohol withdrawal were enrolled in a three-way crossover double-blind study with a balanced incomplete block design. Patients received single doses of three of the following: halazepam, 320 mg; halazepam, 160 mg; diazepam, 40 mg; diazepam, 20 mg; and placebo. The doses of the drugs were approximately equivalent in anxiolytic effect. Patients rated themselves at baseline, 30 min after, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hr after drug on the following: euphoria, sedation, \"drug-liking,\" \"feeling the drug,\" and drug identification. By 30 min both diazepam groups reported increases in euphoria, sedation, and feeling and liking the drug; halazepam groups reported little subjective change at 30 min, and at 1 hr subjective effects did not differ from placebo on any scale. At 2 and 3 hr, both halazepam doses induced subjective effects on several scales, but peak effects were lower than peak effects of high diazepam doses. Unlike diazepam, the higher halazepam dose did not appear to induce greater effects than the lower dose. At peak, more of the diazepam group correctly identified the drug than those in the halazepam groups. More in the halazepam groups identified it as placebo than either diazepam group. To the degree that abuse potential is related to peak intensity and to time of onset of those subjective effects described as pleasant or likable, halazepam should have a lower potential for abuse than diazepam.", 
    "5": "The effects of site of venipuncture on the incidence of venous sequelae, utilizing a standard protocol, were assessed on 48 human subjects. Data were also recorded based on various demographic and clinical variables, including age, sex, race, vein diameter, dose, procedure time, IV fluid volume, injection pain and initial blood flow velocity. When the site of venipuncture was the antecubital fossa there was a significantly lower incidence of venous sequelae than when the venipuncture site was the dorsum of the hand, with the significant variables being venous diameter and procedure time. These findings further support the antecubital fossa as a preferred venipuncture site to the dorsum of the hand; however, there was a sufficient incidence of venous complications (37%) when the antecubital fossa was used to warrant consideration of contributory factors other than site. It appears that time of continuous infusion is a critical element and should be kept at a minimum. Also, subjects in whom Valium was injected demonstrated significantly more venous sequelae than those in whom 5% dextrose in water was injected, confirming previous reports that diazepam is irritating to the endothelial lining and thus is thrombogenic.", 
    "6": "In an attempt to clarify the confusion about venous complications from intravenous diazepam, a study of 2,468 consecutive oral surgery and general dentistry cases in which diazepam was used was undertaken. It was found that 7.9% of the patients experienced local phlebitis and 4.5%, thrombophlebitis during the week after the injection. These findings were correlated with age, weight, sexual gender, dosage, type and duration of procedure, and degree of apprehension experienced by the patient.",

    "8": "The effects of respiratory depression and sleep induction produced by 0.1 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam i.m. were examined in patients in whom urological interventions had to be performed under spinal anesthesia. The same parameters were evaluated for 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam i.m. as well as 50 mg/50 mg of pethidine/promethazine i.m. and placebo i.m. The major difference between 0.1 mg and 0.15 mg/kg body weight of midazolam was a more pronounced PCO2-increase in the group with the higher dosage. Both dosages led to anterograde amnesia in 8 or 9 of 10 patients respectively. No amnesia developed in the control groups. Respiratory depression and sleep induction occurred later with promethazine/pethidine (at 60 min) or diazepam (at 120 min) than with midazolam. Noteworthy in the Diazepam and placebo group was a hyperventilation lasting 60 and 120 min respectively. The arterial PO2 decreased in all groups during the intervention. Under midazolam, the decrease was significantly higher statistically than in the control groups during the first 60 min at both dosages. Premedication with 0.1 mg/kg i.m. of midazolam proved to be sufficient in all patients. The rapid onset of action, the sleep during the intervention and the amnesia associated with it suggest that this form of premedication is more favorable than the other procedures examined. The dosage of 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam proved to be too high: in addition to producing a stronger respiratory depression, it had the effect of rendering cooperation with some patients more difficult.", 
    "9": "It would be predicted that putative benzodiazepine should be released under anxiety-provoking conditions and that behavioural changes should be observed following pretreatment with selective antagonists of the benzodiazepine receptor. To test this hypothesis, adult male albino mice were briefly exposed to a novel, brightly-illuminated arena during the dark phase of their LD cycle. Under these test conditions, Ro15-1788 (10 mg/kg) enhanced total rearing whilst, a 5-10 mg/kg, it significantly altered the normal pattern of rearing over the test session. However, at the highest dose tested (20 mg/kg), such behavioural changes were no longer apparent. A similar, though non-significant, trend was observed for locomotor activity. These data, the first to demonstrate-low-dose intrinsic activity of Ro15-1788 in mice, suggest that benzodiazepine antagonists may prove to be powerful tools in the study of the behavioural significance of the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "10": "A five-compartment open model was used to simulate the blood concentration profiles of diazepam and its metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, following single- and multiple-dose administrations of diazepam. The parameter estimates for diazepam were previously reported literature values. The parameters estimates for the metabolite were calculated from literature values of blood concentrations of desmethyldiazepam following the administration of clorazepate. The five-compartment open model suggests that approximately 50% of the administered diazepam is biotransformed to desmethyldiazepam, and that the elimination profile of the metabolite is not altered by the presence of the drug. The model may also be readily adapted to predict the concentrations of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam in cerebrospinal fluid following the administration of diazepam by simply correcting the blood or plasma concentrations of the drug and metabolite for the degree of plasma protein binding.", 
    "11": "In a double-blind controlled trial of male patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, oral lorazepam was assessed against a placebo. The same anaesthetist performed all spinal blocks and made all assessments. The patients who received lorazepam had substantial amnesia for the operation and were drowsier, but remained cooperative during the procedure. Patient anxiety as assessed by the anaesthetist and as recalled by the patient was decreased, although anxiety assessment by linear analogue was the same for both groups. Lorazepam significantly increased the patient acceptability of spinal anaesthesia.", 
    "12": "Attempts to isolate the putative endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor from bovine urine resulted in the identification of three isoflavans: equol (1), 3',7-dihydroxyisoflavan (2), and 4'-hydroxy-7-methoxyisoflavan (9), as \"diazepam-like\" compounds. 3-Chloro-9H-carbazole (17) was found to enhance the binding of diazepam in the benzodiazepine receptor binding assay. Pinosylvine monomethyl ether (18), indigo (20), and indirubin (21) were isolated as inactive compounds.", 
    "13": "Recent studies have suggested a role for the kappa opiate receptor and its endogenous ligand, dynorphin, in the central regulation of appetite. In this study we found that the ob/ob mouse was mildly resistant to the ability of three kappa agonists, viz, butorphanol, tifluadom, and ketocyclazocine to induce food intake. In addition, we could find no change in ir-dynorphin levels in 7 areas for the central nervous system. These findings do not provide evidence for a role of kappa opioid feeding system in the pathogenesis of obesity in the ob/ob mouse.", 
    "14": "The binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine to receptors was examined in regions of rat brain at various times after subcutaneous injection of kainic acid (KA, 15 mg/kg). The animals exhibited pronounced convulsions 90 min-4 hr after this treatment. During this period (2 hr after the injection of kainic acid) no alterations in the binding of [3H]-GABA or [3H]flunitrazepam to receptors were detected in the frontal cortex, the hippocampus or the amygdala-pyriform cortex. After recovery from the acute convulsive phase, the rats appeared to be hyperexcitable, hyperactive, and displayed marked aggression and occasional clonic convulsions one to 80 days later. During this period a marked increase (80-200%) in the number of binding sites for GABA in the amygdala-pyriform cortex occurred but this was associated with a slow decrease in the number of binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam to 70% control value at 3 weeks. Binding of the \"peripheral\"-type of benzodiazepine ligand, [3H]-Ro5-4864, was increased to 450% of control 3 weeks after injection. In addition, the ability of GABA to stimulate the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was reduced when measured 3 days after the injection of kainic acid. It is suggested that the long-term behavioural syndrome observed in kainic acid-treated rats, as well as the reduced effectiveness of diazepam in preventing seizures in animals treated with kainic acid, (Czuczwar, Turski, Turski and Kleinrock, 1981) may be explained in part by a reduction in the number of neuronal benzodiazepine receptors and a \"desensitization\" of the GABA receptors which are coupled to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "15": "Adinazolam, which is a 1-dimethylaminomethyl triazolobenzodiazepine, is an effective anxiolytic agent as defined by suppression of stress-induced increases in plasma corticosteroids. Adinazolam is also an effective antagonist of pentylenetetrazole. The 1-dimethylaminoethyl triazolo analog, U-43,465F, was inactive in the stressed rat test and only weakly active against pentylenetetrazole. Adinazolam and U-43,465F have been previously shown to have antidepressant activity in classical screening tests. They have also been found to potentiate the effect of norepinephrine and this is consistent with the activity of the known antidepressants; U-43,465F was found to be equieffective to imipramine in this test. Adinazolam was also effective; however, the magnitude of the potentiation was not as great. The uptake of norepinephrine was only weakly affected by either compound. Potentiation or uptake of serotonin were not significantly-altered pharmacological factors. Receptor binding studies were negative except at the benzodiazepine receptor. Chronic treatment with adinazolam did not decrease the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of the rat, in contrast to the positive effect of imipramine. The discovery of triazolobenzodiazepines with antidepressant activity is of special interest. These agents will hopefully have lower toxicity than the tricyclic antidepressants and thus possess a more favourable therapeutic index. This would be advantageous in the treatment of depression.", 
    "16": "The interaction of Ro 15-1788 (5 mg kg-1 i.p.) a benzodiazepine antagonist, with GABA-ergic drugs muscimol (1.4 mg kg-1 i.p.), fenibut (100 mg kg-1 i.p.) and baclofen (5 mg kg-1 i.p.) was examined in behavioural and biochemical studies in rats. All the above-mentioned GABA-ergic drugs produced motor depression and with the exception of muscimol, where anti-aggressive effect was evident, fenibut and baclofen showed only slight antiaggresive properties. Ro 15-1788 attenuated the motor depression produced by these compounds but potentiated their antiaggressive effect. Moreover, it was found that Ro 15-1788 itself possessed dose-related antiaggressive properties. Fenibut increased, whereas muscimol and Ro 15-1788 decreased, the GABA content in the rat striatum. Ro 15-1788 and all the studied GABA-ergic compounds increased the level of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihyroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum. In spite of this no further increase of DOPAC was observed after concomitant use of Ro 15-1788 with GABA-ergic drugs. The action of investigated GABA-ergic drugs via GABA receptors linked to benzodiazepine receptors is suggested.", 
    "17": "The synthesis of derivatives of 4H,6H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][4,1]-benzoxazepine is described. These compounds were tested for activity on type (I) and (II) benzodiazepine receptors by several screening tests on mice.", 
    "18": "The interaction of 5 psychoactive drugs (ethanol, chlorpromazine, diazepam, pentobarbital and THC) with a nonpharmacological factor was studied in rats. The nonpharmacological variable studied was the level of motivation to overcome the depressant action of the drugs administered. Rats highly motivated to perform a learned escape response (high intensity footshocks during training) required significantly higher doses of ethanol to become impaired when compared to low motivated animals (low intensity footshocks during training). However, the level of motivation did not interact with the action of the other 4 drugs, as the doses required to impair the escape response were the same in the low and high motivated rats. The greater susceptibility of ethanol to a nonpharmacological factor when compared to the other psychoactive drugs is discussed.", 
    "19": "Advances in understanding the neurobiologic bases of anxiety are reviewed. The discovery of a class of compounds generically known as \"benzodiazepine antagonists\" has been central to much of this work. One such group of compounds, the beta-carbolines, cause convulsions, produce an anxiety-like syndrome in primates, and reduce sleep. These compounds will provide a valuable means of investigating the mechanism of action of potential anxiolytics and of drugs currently used to treat anxious patients.", 
    "20": "The treatment of chronic peptic ulcer involves the treatment of acute exacerbations and the complications, and the prevention of ulcer recurrence. Several drugs accelerate the initial healing of ulcer and include the H2-receptor antagonists (cimetidine and ranitidine), colloidal bismuth, sucralfate, pirenzepine, carbenoxolone sodium, prostaglandins, high dose antacids and trimipramine. The long term management of ulcer involves the use of drugs and, in selected patients, surgery. Drugs used in this context include H2-receptor antagonists, pirenzepine, sucralfate and probably prostaglandins when further trial evidence is available. Regimens of long term drug treatment include intermittent treatment and maintenance treatment. The former consists of no active treatment after the ulcer is healed and the treatment of each acute exacerbation when it occurs, this treatment involving any one of the several drug routines mentioned above. If exacerbations are frequent (i.e. more than 2 to 3 years), maintenance therapy with H2-receptor antagonists, pirenzepine or sucralfate is advised. If the ulcer recurs despite long term treatment, it may be healed again using the healing dose of the above agents, and maintenance therapy recommenced if the remission induced by maintenance therapy was several years. If the remission was short, surgery should be advised.", 
    "21": "It is suggested that the inhibitory action of phenazepam on the evoked potential (EP) in the CA1 area of the hippocamp in response to the stimulation of Schaffer's collaterals is mediated by phenazepam interaction with a specific benzodiazepine receptor (BR). Experiments were made to study the action of a specific benzodiazepine antagonist RO15-1788 on the phenazepam-induced inhibition in the hippocamp. After RO15-1788 administration (4 microM) the phenazepam-induced (2 microM) inhibition of evoked activity of hippocampal neurons was attenuated. The inhibition provoked by hexenal (2 microM) was not affected by antagonist administration. It is concluded that phenazepam effect on the EP is related to the interaction with BR. In most cases, RO15-1788 (4 microM) had an insignificant inhibitory effect on the EP. However, in individual experiments, it produced an opposite action, i. e. raised the evoked activity of neurons.", 
    "22": "We propose that the conformation of 1,4-benzodiazepines that is recognized by the binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor complex is one in which the planes formed by the fused benzene ring and the methylene group (and the two adjoining atoms) of the diazepine ring are in the R configuration. The derivation of this conformation was based on comparisons of computer-generated 3-dimensional structures obtained from single-crystal X-ray data for diazepam, (R)- and (S)-1,3-dimethyl-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-7-nitro-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2- one, and the structurally rigid ethyl (S)-7-chloro-11,12,13,13 alpha-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H-imidazo[1,5-alpha] pyrrolo[2,1-d][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate. The affinity of ligands for the benzodiazepine binding site was determined using the [3H]-diazepam binding assay.", 
    "23": "The modulation of solubilized type 1 and type 2 benzodiazepine receptors from cow brain by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), divalent cations, and anions has been evaluated. GABA stimulates [3H] flunitrazepam binding of both receptor subtypes, whereas divalent cations and anions selectively stimulate solubilized type 2 receptors. Of numerous anions examined, only chloride, bromide, and iodide enhance [3H] flunitrazepam binding. Chloride and bromide increase mainly receptor affinity for [3H]flunitrazepam, whereas iodide largely influences Bmax values. Divalent cations also stimulate soluble type 2 receptors. Calcium, zinc, manganese, barium, and magnesium have similar potencies in enhancing [3H]flunitrazepam binding, whereas copper and nickel are about 4 to 5 times more potent. The 2- to 3-fold increase in type 2 receptor binding by divalent cations involves change in numbers of binding sites. Effects of combinations of GABA, calcium, and chloride suggest that they may exert their modulating effects on type 2 receptors through different mechanisms. GABA, calcium, and chloride also protect [3H]flunitrazepam binding from heat inactivation, indicating a close link in the native state between the GABA, ions, and the benzodiazepine recognition sites. Since physiologic concentrations of calcium and chloride influence type 2 receptors, these ions may be involved in those pharmacologic effects of benzodiazepines mediated by type 2 sites.", 
    "24": "Recently, it was proposed that beta-carbolines interact with a subset of benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites in mouse brain. This postulate was based upon evidence showing changes in binding properties of the BZD receptor following photoaffinity labeling of membranes with flunitrazepam (FLU). Under conditions in which 80% of specific [3H]diazepam binding was lost in photolabeled membranes, specific [3H]propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate [( 3H]PCC) binding was spared. In this study, the binding of the BZD antagonists [3H]PCC, [3H]Ro15 1788 and [3H]CGS 8216 was examined in rat brain membranes following photoaffinity labeling with FLU. No significant changes in the apparent KD and small reductions in the Bmax of 3H antagonist binding were observed. However, in the same membranes, up to 89% of specific [3H]FLU binding was lost. When [3H]PCC (0.05 nM) was used to label the receptors in control and photolabeled membranes, the ability of BZD receptor agonists to inhibit [3H]PCC binding was greatly diminished in the photolabeled membranes. In contrast, the potency of BZD antagonists remained the same in both control and treated membranes. Based upon PCC/[3H]Ro15 1788 competition experiments, the ability of PCC to discriminate between BZD receptor subtypes was unaffected by photoaffinity labeling of cortical membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Structure-activity relationships for binding at site II on human serum albumin have been investigated using drugs, fatty acids, and aliphatic amines with chain lengths C-3 to C-18. A negative charge is not required for binding provided a strongly electronegative center is present. For example, diazepam, a basic drug that exists mainly in the un-ionized form at neutral pH, also binds with high affinity to site II. However, aliphatic amines (pKa values 10-11) with chain lengths C-3 to C-12 did not displace markers from either site I or II, showing that the presence of a positive charge precludes binding at these sites. Short-chain fatty acids, C-3 to C-5, did not displace marker drugs or fluorescent probes from either site I or II when added at equimolar ratios with albumin. Displacement of site II (but not site I) markers occurred with medium-chain fatty acids, C-7 to C-11, and was maximal at C-10. Fatty acids with chain lengths C-10 to C-18 caused an enhancement of fluorescence of dansylamide bound to site I, the maximal effect occurring with C-12. Both arylpropionic acid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and medium-chain fatty acids binding at site II had molecular lengths within the range 11-16 A. The effect of hydrophobicity (and/or molecular length) on binding affinity was much more marked with the arylpropionic acids than with the fatty acids, suggesting that bulkier aromatic molecules form more effective interactions at the binding site. The results suggest that site II is a hydrophobic cleft about 16 A deep and about 8 A wide in the albumin molecule with a cationic group located near the surface.", 
    "26": "The behavioral effects of ethyl loflazepate and its metabolites were investigated in mice and rats, and they were compared with those of diazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam. Locomotor activity of rats in open-field situation was increased with a wide range of doses of ethyl loflazepate and with large doses of nitrazepam. The anticonflict effect of ethyl loflazepate was slightly more potent than that of diazepam and much more potent than that of lorazepam. In suppressing muricide of both olfactory bulbectomized and raphe lesioned rats, ethyl loflazepate was approximately as potent as diazepam and much less potent than nitrazepam and lorazepam. Ethyl loflazepate was more potent than diazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam in preventing pentetrazol-induced convulsion. In potentiating thiopental anesthesia in mice and impairing rotarod performance in mice and rats, ethyl loflazepate was less potent than diazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam. The pharmacological activities of CM6913 and CM7116, metabolites of ethyl loflazepate, were approximately as potent as that of ethyl loflazepate. The duration of action of ethyl loflazepate was longer than those of the metabolites. These results indicate that ethyl loflazepate possesses pharmacological properties characteristic to benzodiazepines, and it is approximately equal to diazepam in potency and has a longer duration of action than diazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam.", 
    "27": "U-43,465F displays activity in a number of classical antidepressant assays in rodents. Mechanistically, it potentiates norepinephrine and blocks the uptake of this amine but not that of serotonin. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor nor does it markedly enhance monamine release. In several behavioral assays based upon conditioned and non-conditioned behavioral suppression, U-43,465F displays anxiolytic properties. Thus this compound possesses both antidepressant-like and anxiolytic activities and may have a special utility in the treatment of depressive disorders.", 
    "28": "Forty-nine patients with major depression and a reduced (less than 65.0 minute) REM latency were treated in a randomized, double-blind study with either amitriptyline or alprazolam. Predictors of response were sought for the whole group and for each drug cell individually. A longer current episode and a higher Beck Depression Inventory to Hamilton Rating Scale ratio were predictive of a poorer response for the whole group and for the alprazolam group. A longer current episode was also predictive of a poor response to amitriptyline. These data suggest that (1) a longer current episode and (2) a greater level of self-reported compared to clinician-observed symptoms correlate with a poorer response to antidepressant medications.", 
    "29": "The authors suggest a rapid, simple and economical method for the measurement of the minimal toxic dose for the drugs with marked dose-effect dependence. The method is based on the use of the precalculated tables, with minimal consumption of laboratory animals. The data obtained, while providing for statistical significance, make it possible to measure, as the minimal toxic dose, the TD10 rather than the TD16, which raises the method sensitivity.", 
    "30": "A new daytime tranquilizer uxepam--1-methyl-4-carbamoyl-5-phenyl-7-chloro-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-1, 4-benzodiazepine-2-on (RGH-3331) administered to animals removes emotional-behavioral abnormalities under conflict situation, reduces aggressiveness induced by electric and painful stimulation, prevents convulsions induced by corasole and electric shock, prolongs the hypnotic effect of hexenal. When applied in high doses the drug suppresses the avoidance reflex, orienting-research behavior and motor activity, disturbs movement coordination. Within wide dosage range uxepam potentiates the summation activity in the central nervous system. As regards anxiolytic activity, the drug does not yield to diazepam and compares very favourably with chlordiazepoxide. The sedative and myorelaxant effects displayed by uxepam are insignificant. The data obtained make it possible to attribute uxepam to daytime tranquilizers.", 
    "31": "Experiments on rats with brain edema under water intoxication were made to examine the effect of the benzodiazepine tranquilizers diazepam and phenazepam on the time course of the recovery of brain electrical activity after passing the spreading Leao's depression wave. It was found that the drugs indicated possess antiedematous properties and improve brain function under these conditions. It is assumed that the drug action on the spreading depression is linked with their effect on metabolic processes in the brain and antiedematous properties.", 
    "32": "Toluene exposures or injections of diazepam reinstated lever responses that had been suppressed by punishment in laboratory rats. When concentrations of toluene or diazepam that were ineffective or minimally effective in this paradigm were administered in combination, they produced a qualitatively similar effect which was much greater than the sum total of effects produced by the same amount of either substance alone. These observations suggest an anxiolytic action for toluene and a possible synergism between the two substances.", 
    "33": "The available data from animal and human studies on mechanisms postulated to be involved in the production and mediation of anxiety are reviewed. Effects of specific agents used to treat clinical anxiety, and/or studied in research on experimentally induced behaviors resembling clinical anxiety, are examined in terms of their implications for the etiology and management of these symptoms. In the search for an ideal anxiolytic (i.e., one which would selectively decrease anxiety without producing sedation, cognitive or psychomotor impairment, tolerance/dependence, untoward psychologic reactions, interactions with CNS depressants, or morbidity risk in overdose), recent research has focused on several nonbenzodiazepine substances. Results of these studies indicate that continued study and development of nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics will facilitate achievement of optimum pharmacotherapeutic approaches to the management of clinical anxiety.", 
    "34": "Although the benzodiazepines have been proven effective and safe in the treatment of anxiety, research has continued in an effort to find agents that lack sedative effects and abuse/dependence liability, and do not potentiate the effects of CNS depressants. Although several nonbenzodiazepine agents have shown anxiolytic effects, most are ineffective, or their efficacy not proven, in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). One nonbenzodiazepine, buspirone, has shown significant efficacy in treating GAD in comparisons with placebo and reference compounds. Further investigations are necessary to assess effects of use over time.", 
    "35": "The psychologic (i.e., psychotherapeutic or behavioral) and pharmacologic approaches available for the treatment of anxiety are reviewed. Accurate diagnosis and consideration of patient characteristics are essential in choosing among the numerous treatment options. Nonpharmacologic methods are generally the first treatment choice in situational and nonincapacitating anxiety. When anxiety is severe and prolonged, adjunctive drug treatment is appropriate, with antidepressants for phobic and panic states and anxiolytics for generalized anxiety disorder and mixed anxiety and depression. Benzodiazepines are currently the anxiolytics of choice; newer nonbenzodiazepine compounds may provide increased safety.", 
    "36": "A double-blind crossover study in 53 psychiatric outpatients compared the safety and efficacy of triazolam and placebo in relieving insomnia refractory to treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant. Patients with a depressive disorder who had been taking a TCA for at least 6 weeks received triazolam or placebo for 4 days, neither medication for 1 day, and the alternative treatment for 4 days. The antidepressant regimen was maintained throughout the study. Sleep measurements showed triazolam to be consistently more effective than placebo in promoting and maintaining sleep and enabling the patient to awaken feeling rested. No worsening in depression or anxiety was seen with either triazolam or placebo; some measures indicated improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms on triazolam. One patient on triazolam dropped out because of side effects. The most common side effect was mild to moderate drowsiness.", 
    "37": "One hundred and eighty-five patients were allocated at random to receive pethidine with diazepam (in an emulsion), or pethidine with midazolam i.v. as sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Sedation and conditions for examination were comparable and satisfactory in both groups. Midazolam produced more amnesia (P = less than 0.001), and scored higher in patients' opinion (P = less than 0.001); it was associated with a slightly greater frequency of venous sequelae, but the difference in thrombophlebitis was not statistically significant. Recovery of sensory--motor performance, as assessed by Trieger test, was still incomplete 2 h after endoscopy with both drug regimens.", 
    "38": "Midazolam hydrochloride and diazepam in emulsion were compared as i.v. sedatives for spinal anaesthesia. Mean doses of midazolam 12 mg and diazepam 27 mg were required to induce sleep and provide good or adequate sedation throughout surgery of approximately 1 h duration. Neither drug caused loss of the airway or significant cardiorespiratory changes. The frequency of drowsiness after operation was greater following sedation with diazepam, but objective testing of recovery with the Trieger test showed no significant difference between the two drugs. The frequency of amnesia was greater following midazolam.", 
    "39": "The 2-benzazepine 9-chloro-7-(2-chlorophenyl)-5H-pyrimido[5,4-d] [2]benzazepine (1) has been selected for development as an anxiolytic agent. In support of this program, we have confirmed by chemical synthesis the structures of three in vitro (rat liver homogenate) metabolites of 1 and confirmed the structure of the major in vivo (dog and man) metabolite of 1, compound 2. Two of the metabolites, arising from hydroxylation of the pyrimidobenzazepine ring at the 5-position (2) and N-oxide formation at the 3-position of the pyrimidobenzazepine ring (3), were found to be as active as 1 in a series of pharmacological tests. The third metabolite, formed by hydroxylation of the 7-phenyl group in the 4-position (4), was found to be inactive in the same pharmacological screens.", 
    "40": "A series of 5H-pyrimido[5,4-d][2]benzazepines has been synthesized, starting from the corresponding 2-benzazepin-5-ones, and evaluated as potential anxiolytic agents. Selected compounds from this series show a pharmacological profile of action different than that of diazepam. They are more potent than diazepam in the anti-pentylenetetrazole test and in the [3H]diazepam binding assay, yet show less activity in the inclined screen test. A pharmacological data profile is given for 9-chloro-7-(2-chlorophenyl)-5H-pyrimido[5,4-d] [2]benzazepine (7c). The structure-activity relationships of these potential anxiolytic agents are discussed.", 
    "41": "Alterations in one subunit of the proposed GABA receptor complex, namely, the GABA receptor, have been observed in Huntington's disease cerebellum. We measured binding to a second subunit, the benzodiazepine binding site, in the autopsied cerebellum of 12 patients dying with adult-onset Huntington's disease. Neuronal benzodiazepine ([3H]flunitrazepam) binding density (Bmax) and affinity in cerebellar cortex of the Huntington's disease patients were not significantly different from control values. Similarly, maximal GABA stimulation of benzodiazepine binding was normal in the Huntington's disease cerebellum. In addition, no significant changes were observed in the concentrations of GABA, glutamate, and taurine in cerebellar cortex, nor of GABA in the dentate nucleus.", 
    "42": "Although benzodiazepines can inhibit adenosine uptake into central neurones, this effect is not antagonized by behaviourally effective 'benzodiazepine antagonists' such as Ro 15-1788. We now report that Ro 15-1788 and the 'peripheral' benzodiazepine ligand Ro 05-4864 themselves inhibit adenosine accumulation by rat brain synaptosomes. The inhibition of adenosine accumulation may thus underlie those behavioural effects of benzodiazepines which are mimicked but not antagonized by Ro 15-1788.", 
    "43": "Electrolytic lesions of entorhinal cortex have previously been shown to consistently produce limbic seizures. We report a bilateral and symmetrical decline in benzodiazepine receptor number in dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation in unilateral entorhinal cortex-lesioned animals. We think this decline is caused by seizures since phenobarbital pretreatment prevented the appearance of limbic seizures and blocked the receptor decline. We postulate that these receptor declines may contribute to decreased endogenous recurrent inhibition (a presumed GABAergic synapse) of dentate granule cells which could lead to their repetitive firing. Thus these benzodiazepine receptor declines may be a consequence of limbic seizures yet increase the likelihood of subsequent seizures.", 
    "44": "Muscarinic receptors were characterized in isolated intact chief and parietal cell enriched cell populations from canine and guinea-pig gastric mucosa by binding of tritiated N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS). Antagonist and agonist binding was studied by displacement of [3H]NMS with non-radioactive atropine, pirenzepine, pilocarpine and carbachol. Model analysis points to the existence of two binding sites in each of the two cell populations. The number of binding sites per cell was 1.7-1.8 times higher in parietal than in chief cell populations. Subclasses of muscarinic receptors as characterized by pirenzepine binding were compatible with the suggested A- and C- (high and low affinity) binding sites. The observation that in canine cells GMPPNP induced a conformational change of the high affinity binding site for pirenzepine could suggest that their proportion might depend on environmental factors. Binding parameters were related to specific parietal cell function as measured by aminopyrine accumulation as index for acid secretion. The carbachol effects depended on the calcium concentration and were competitively inhibited by pirenzepine. The physiological relevance of muscarinic receptor heterogeneity in gastric mucosal cells is unknown although the data support the hypothesis that involvement of muscarinic binding sites in calcium transport mechanisms connected with parietal cell function and possible conformational changes of the binding sites might be regulatory parameters in gastric secretory processes.", 
    "45": "The seizure threshold for different seizure components was measured after slow intravenous infusion of bicuculline in the rat. Clear differences were seen in the seizure threshold for tremor (TRE) and clonic-forepaw (CLOF) as compared to clonic-hindpaw (CLOH) and tonic-forepaw (TONF). Seizure threshold was measured after treatment with different doses of diazepam, pentobarbital, D-etomidate, picrotoxin, RO15-1788 and (+/-)-5-(1,3,-dimethylbutyl)-5-barbituric acid (DMBB). Direct and indirect antagonism between the agonists and antagonists was examined. The interactions between the drugs for TRE and CLOF resemble those described in in vitro receptor-binding assays using the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ionophore complex (GBCI). The interactions for CLOH and TONF do not show this resemblance, suggesting less involvement of GABA in these phenomena. Diazepam was selectively antagonized by RO15-1788. D-Etomidate and pentobarbital were directly antagonized by DMBB, suggesting shared activity at the barbiturate site. No evidence was found for an interaction between compounds acting at different sites within the GBCI.", 
    "46": "Haloperidol in low doses antagonized the apomorphine-induced cage-climbing behaviour of mice, whereas ceruletide (CER) and its analogue, Nle8-CER-(4-10) had very weak anticlimbing efficacy; Nle8-CER and diazepam were inactive. The ptosis caused by CER and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) was antagonized by apomorphine in doses 27 times smaller than those effective against the haloperidol-induced ptosis. No such differences occurred when either methylphenidate or picrotoxin replaced apomorphine. Low-dose haloperidol was an antagonist to the antiptotic effect of apomorphine versus both CER and CCK-8. The rearing inhibiting effect of CER and haloperidol, in contrast to that of clonazepam, was very resistant to apomorphine. Methylphenidate was weakly effective against clonazepam and haloperidol but inactive versus CER. Picrotoxin was no antagonist to either rearing inhibiting agent. The results taken together suggest presynaptic sites of the dopaminergic system as important for the production of ptosis by CCK-like peptides.", 
    "47": "Receptor binding estimates of the number of GABA and associated benzodiazepine (Bz) receptors were made in several brain regions following kindling. While the number of GABA receptors, as measured by both [3H]GABA and [3H]muscimol binding, was unaltered by kindling, Bz receptors were significantly increased in kindled amygdala and hippocampus. As the Bz receptor apparently functions to enhance GABA transmission, this finding suggests a possible mechanism for the kindling-induced enhancement of inhibition observed in previous evoked potential experiments.", 
    "48": "Double-pulse stimulation of the perforant path input to the dentate gyrus was used in the following experiments to produce paired pulse depression in that site. This effect provided an estimate of GABA-mediated recurrent inhibition. The depression was enhanced by drugs that facilitate or mimic GABA action and attenuated by drugs which block GABA transmission. Paired-pulse depression was significantly increased following amygdala kindling and was further enhanced to near maximal levels by subsequent kindling in the dentate. In addition, kindling did not increase the rate at which inhibition failed under conditions of excessive activation. Trains of 5 Hz stimulation, applied to the perforant path, caused paired-pulse depression to disappear and elicited a brief AD. Following kindling, the latency to AD onset tended to be increased rather than shortened, suggesting an enhanced resistance to inhibitory failure. These results indicated that kindling increased, rather than reduced, inhibition in the dentate gyrus.", 
    "49": "Astemizole and terfenadine, two potent non-sedative H1 antihistamines, had no effect on itch measured objectively as nocturnal scratching and subjectively on a 10 cm line. Trimeprazine, however, a more sedative but less potent H1 antihistamine, was antipruritic, as was nitrazepam, a sedative benzodiazepine. We concluded (a) that antipruritic drugs act centrally by a property related to sedation; (b) H1 receptor antagonists have a peripheral antipruritic action only when itch is due to histamine release, as in the wealing disorders. Thus the new nonsedative H1 antihistamines have no place in the treatment of itch from other causes.", 
    "50": "Because previous studies have emphasized the importance of the amygdala in the therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines and described differences in benzodiazepine receptor distribution between human and rat, this study examined the distribution of multiple benzodiazepine receptors in normal human amygdala by light microscopic autoradiography. Benzodiazepine receptors were labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam at 5 representative rostro-caudal levels. Type 1 and Type 2 receptors were differentiated by the addition of 200 nM CL218,872 to serial sections and subsequent analysis based on the differential occupancy at Type 1 and Type 2 receptors by this drug. Results demonstrated that like the rat amygdala, human amygdala contains a higher density of benzodiazepine receptors in the basolateral nuclear complex compared to the corticomedial complex, and more Type 2 than Type 1 receptors overall. However, while rat amygdala is enriched rostrally in Type 1 receptors, this subclass in humans is elevated caudally. Pathways including the amygdala and limbic and cortical targets of its efferents may be preferential loci of benzodiazepine anxiolytic activity.", 
    "51": "The anticonvulsant properties of the 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam were studied in mice during and after chronic treatment at two different dose levels. Pentylenetetrazol given by slow intravenous infusion was used as the convulsant stimulus. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects was observed; this was rapid in onset and could be overcome by increasing the dose of clobazam.", 
    "52": "Rapid and sensitive methods are described for determining lorazepam and for determining chlordiazepoxide and its metabolites in brain tissue of the rat. Lorazepam was determined by means of solvent extraction and electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography and concentrations as low as 5 ng/g tissue could be measured. High-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection was used to determine chlordiazepoxide and its metabolites and was sensitive to 0.1 micrograms/g tissue. The methods were used to investigate the brain and plasma pharmacokinetics of these compounds in animals that had been chronically treated with lorazepam or chlordiazepoxide. In both experiments brain and plasma levels of all compounds assayed were found to correlate highly.", 
    "53": "DMCM (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) is a very potent convulsant with high affinity for specific benzodiazepine binding sites. A number of compounds were compared for their ability to prevent seizures induced by DMCM and pentylenetetrazol. DMCM seizures were antagonized by benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonists, such as Ro 15-1788, CGS 8216 and several beta-carboline-3-carboxylates, which all fail to inhibit pentylenetetrazol seizures. The benzodiazepines diazepam, clonazepam and lorazepam as well as valproate, ethosuximid, phenobarbital, primidone, diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine antagonized both DMCM and pentylenetetrazol. Muscimol and gamma-vinyl-GABA did not inhibit DMCM seizures whereas THIP showed a weak and selective effect against DMCM. Valproate showed a relatively potent (60 mg/kg i.p.) and competitive antagonism of short duration. Baclofen antagonized DMCM at 3 mg/kg. Valproate and baclofen were at least 5 times more potent against DMCM-induced than against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. DMCM most probably induces the seizures by selective impairment of the functions mediated by the GABA/BZ receptor-chloride channel complex (inverse agonism) and therefore differs from GABA receptor blockers.", 
    "54": "Benzodiazepine receptors were solubilized from calf brain cortex by the ionic detergent deoxycholate and by the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. Approximately 90% of the soluble benzodiazepine receptors of both preparations were heat inactivated within 30 min at 55 degrees C. 100 microM of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) protected 80% of Triton X-100 solubilized benzodiazepine receptors and 56% of the deoxycholate soluble benzodiazepine receptors from heat inactivation. Time course of heat inactivation showed that the deoxycholate soluble receptors are more sensitive to heat than the Triton X-100 soluble receptors.", 
    "55": "A group of 82 nonselected patients with the leading symptom \"anxiety\" as part of psychoreactive disturbances was included in a study comparing the effectiveness of fluspirilene and bromazepam. The results of an earlier pilot study showing on the whole the superiority of fluspirilene versus bromazepam was confirmed. The absence of significant side-effects under either medication seems to indicate, that the administration of the low-dose long-acting neuroleptic might be a preferable alternative to tranquilizers, especially in patients, in whom a danger of misuse cannot be excluded.", 
    "56": "Several endogenous substances that inhibit central-type benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor binding have recently been identified. We have found that ultrafiltrates of human uremic plasma, normal plasma, and urine contain competitive inhibitors of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. Using urine as source, we have partially purified a peripheral-type BZD receptor inhibitor(s) by adsorption to and selective elution from small octadecyl-silane (Sep-pak) columns and thin layer chromatography. The inhibitor has a 125-fold greater affinity for peripheral-type than central-type BZD receptors and has been purified 8000-fold from urine.", 
    "57": "This paper reviews the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) from a historical and psychological perspective. The physician must recognize that the premenstruum-the four days before the onset of the menses-is a `high risk' phase for women. They may demonstrate somatic and psychological complaints such as irritability, aggression, tension, anxiety, depression, lethargy, insomnia, poor coordination and concentration. Psychological disturbances can range from self-deprecation and the feeling that `everything is too much' to pronounced feelings of oppression and depression. Psychiatric patients may become even more disturbed at this time. Recent reviews on PMS have studied its etiology and its possible connection to hormone imbalance, but to date there is no complete explanation for the syndrome's psychological symptoms. The most promising treatments for the psychological symptoms of PMS are pyridoxine (although there are conflicting reports about it), antidepressants, benzodiazepines if anxiety and tension dominate, and ongoing psychotherapy for severe cases.", 
    "58": "Peptic ulcer treatment with high dose regimens of antacids may be inconvenient and unpleasant, and the risk of side effects should not be neglected. Anticholinergics are claimed to accentuate and prolong the effect of antacids on intragastric acidity. In the study the effect on postprandial intragastric pH of a moderate dose of antacids in combination with pirenzepine was compared with that of a double dose of antacids in six healthy subjects, to see whether the dose of antacids could be reduced when given in combination with an antimuscarinic compound. Doubling the dose of antacids caused higher pH peaks while adding pirenzepine caused a more sustained pH elevation. The curves showing the percentage of pH readings greater than or equal to each pH level were almost identical up to pH 4. The results support the rationale of using antacids and pirenzepine in combination.", 
    "59": "The effects of four premedication regimes on clinical variables regarded as important in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were evaluated in a double-blind randomized study. The drug combinations were diazepam/glucagon, diazepam/atropine, pethidine/glucagon, and pethidine/atropine. No significant difference was observed among the combinations of regimes or between diazepam and pethidine or between glucagon and atropine with regard to the variables duration of examination, vomiting, secretion and maximal pyloric opening. Pethidine was more effective than diazepam in reducing salivation and pyloric reflux. Glucagon was more effective than atropine in reducing motility and reflux and was also superior to atropine with regard to diagnostic accuracy. Glucagon caused less subjective discomfort than atropine 2 h and 1 day after the investigation.", 
    "60": "Behavioral and electroencephalographic effects of clobazam (CBZ), a 1, 5 benzodiazepine, were investigated in mice, rats and rabbits and compared with the effects of diazepam (DZP) and chlordiazepoxide (CDP). In EEG studies of rabbits, CBZ, DZP and CDP at doses of 2-10 mg/kg, i.v., caused a drowsy pattern, i.e., high voltage slow waves in the frontal cortex and the desynchronization of hippocampal theta wave. EEG arousal responses induced not only by auditory stimulation but also by electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation were inhibited by CBZ; CBZ was less potent than DZP, but more potent than CDP. On hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior of rats, low rate responses induced by low current brain stimulation, VI or DRL procedure were increased by oral administration of the three drugs. CBZ was less potent than DZP in the above respondings, but the same potency as CDP in VI or DRL responding and more potent in low rate responding induced by low current stimulation. The preventive effect of CBZ on MES convulsion in mice was less potent than DZP, but 2.5 times as potent as CDP. The preventive effect of CBZ was 1.3 times as potent as DZP and 2.5 times as potent as CDP. CBZ reduced the hyperemotionality of olfactory bulbectomized rats, and this effect was less than DZP in suppressing muricide. The muscle relaxant effect of CBZ in inclined screen and rotarod tests of mice was less than that of DZP. CBZ was 2.2 times as potent as CDP in potentiating thiopental sleep in mice, but less than DZP. These results indicate that CBZ is qualitatively similar to 1, 4 benzodiazepines, DZP and CDP, and is more potent than CDP, but less potent than DZP.", 
    "61": "In 40 female ASA class I-II patients, scheduled for laparoscopy, midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v. was compared with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1 i.v. for induction of anaesthesia after parenteral premedication. Loss of the eyelash reflex occurred significantly earlier (p less than 0.005) in the thiopentone group (23.3 s) than in the midazolam group (37.5 s). During orotracheal intubation a more stable cardiovascular course was found with midazolam than with thiopentone. Awakening was markedly slower with midazolam than with thiopentone. Anterograde amnesia of more than 60 minutes after induction of anaesthesia occurred in 50% of midazolam patients compared with 10% in the thiopentone group. No significant differences in side effects could be found. Midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 was sufficient to induce anaesthesia reliably after premedication with droperidol and fentanyl shortly before induction.", 
    "62": "Previous investigations have revealed that prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ) alters brain development and behavior in the offspring of rats and mice. In order to understand how DZ may affect the developing nervous system it is necessary to examine its metabolic fate in the neonate. It is therefore the aim of this study to investigate the disposition, metabolism, and persistence of DZ in the neonate. Dams were injected s.c. with 2.5 mg/kg of 14C DZ (10 muCi/day) on days 13-20 of gestation and their litters were fostered at birth. Dams killed within 24 hours postpartum and neonates killed at postnatal days 0, 10, and 20 were analyzed for 14C activity. Brain levels (pmoles DZ and metabolites/100 mg tissue SE) were 3.4 +/- 0.3 in the dam and in the neonates were 3.2 +/- 0.3 (day 0), 3.4 +/- 0.3 (day 10), and undetectable at day 20. Neonatal peripheral tissue 14C activity was undetectable by day 10. Brain regional analysis indicates 14C is highest in the colliculi at day 0, but not at day 10. Brain levels of DZ, oxazepam (OXA), N-desmethyldiazepam (NDZ), and the glucuronide (GLU) determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were GLU (49%), DZ (28%), and NDZ (24%) in the dam; GLU (52%), DZ (24%), and NDZ (25%) in the day 0 neonate; and GLU (32%), DZ (12%), NDZ (39%), and OXA (19%) at day 10. The distribution and metabolism of 14C DZ that persists in the neonate following prenatal exposure differs from that which occurs in the dam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Power spectral analysis was used to study temporalis muscle EMG activities during the sleep-awake cycle in the rat. EMG spectra derived from EMG during the states of slow-wave sleep. REM sleep and wakefulness demonstrated qualitative and quantitative differences. Diazepam treatment produced reductions in EMG spectral power during wakefulness. Thus, our experimental model allows qualitative and quantitative delineation of EMG activity associated with behavioral changes or drug treatments.", 
    "64": "The usefulness of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale as a screening instrument to uncover masked depression, and the benefits of early identification and treatment with alprazolam, were evaluated in a general medical practice population. There was a 95% scale acceptance by patients and a 12% overall prevalence of depression based on SDS results. Patients who scored in the depressed range on the SDS were, on a randomized basis, either identified immediately to their physicians and treated with alprazolam (N = 21) or identified after 4 weeks (natural history controls, N = 20). Treatment resulted in improvement in 66% of the identified group versus a 35% spontaneous improvement in the control group (p less than .05).", 
    "65": "The use of intravenous benzodiazepines often results in amnesia for events subsequent to drug administration (anterograde amnesia). To asses the effects of oral administration, a single 2 mg dose of lorazepam was given to 6 normal subjects. No substantial effect on immediate recall of word lists was seen in comparison with 6 placebo control subjects. However, the active drug significantly hindered the delayed recall of words. These findings indicate that lorazepam, taken orally as a daytime tranquilizer, can have amnestic action.", 
    "66": "Electroencephalographic aspects of coma in 201 children are presented. The ages of the subjects ranged between 1 month and 14 years. The EEG picture was not specific. Diffuse slowing and convulsive activity were present in meningoencephalitis and postconvulsive coma. Diffuse slowing was also present in coma of metabolic origin. Mixed slow and fast activity was typical of coma due to benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol. In patients with intracerebral hemorrhages, there was marked focal slowing associated with generalized delta and theta waves. In 12 patients with craniocerebral trauma, the EEG showed generalized slowing which was associated with focal reduction of voltage in 6 cases and with convulsive activity in 2. Extreme slowing or an isoelectric recording had a bad prognosis. The reappearance of sleep spindles was a favorable sign.", 
    "67": "The respiratory effects of lorazepam (a 1, 4 benzodiazepine) were studied using a modified Read rebreathing technique in healthy adult males about to undergo elective surgery. Lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg (IV) produced an increase in slope and a shift to the left of the CO2 response curve. These effects were also detectable but of smaller magnitude when the same lorazepam dose (IV) was given with meperidine (IV). End-expiratory CO2 (PeCO2), which was significantly elevated in all drug groups, is not a sensitive indicator of either the time course or the degree of respiratory depression.", 
    "68": "A research neuroscientist in his fifties, who has recovered from endogenous depression after several years, describes the experience and makes some comments on treatment and management. He found electroconvulsive therapy, mianserin, lithium carbonate and diazepam acceptable. He considers that occupational therapy and conventional psychotherapy were counter-therapeutic. He stresses how physically ill he felt when depressed, and compares this with prolonged influenza. He hypothesizes that the underlying psychological disorder in endogenous depression is the learned extinction of optimistic thoughts, and suggests that any psychotherapy used should be aimed at restoring these.", 
    "69": "The pharmacokinetics and serum protein binding of oxazepam, a drug mainly eliminated by a single step glucuronidation reaction, were studied in nine epileptic patients treated long-term with phenytoin or phenytoin with phenobarbitone, and in nine healthy control subjects. Oxazepam elimination half-life was shorter and apparent oral clearance higher in treated patients than in age and sex matched control subjects. Serum bilirubin concentration was lower in treated patients. There was no significant correlation between serum bilirubin concentrations and oxazepam elimination. Serum alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentration was higher in the treated patients than in the control group. Oxazepam was more than 93% bound to serum proteins, but the extent of binding was not significantly different between the two groups. These results show that oxazepam glucuronyl transferase activity is increased by treatment with phenytoin alone or in combination with phenobarbitone in epileptic patients.", 
    "70": "In vitro lipophilicity of a series of benzodiazepines was evaluated by octanol: buffer partition ratio at physiological pH, and by retention time on a reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) system with a neutral-pH mobile phase. Both approaches ranked diazepam as highly lipophilic, but overall the two indices were poorly correlated (r = 0.23). For seven of the benzodiazepines, the in vivo volume of distribution (Vd) was determined in pharmacokinetic studies. After correlation for individual values of protein binding, Vd for unbound drug was significantly correlated with octanol: buffer partition ratio (r = 0.74), and to a greater extent with HPLC retention (r = 0.81). Thus, lipid solubility at least partly determines the extent of benzodiazepine distribution in vivo, which in turn is a major determinant of the duration of clinical action after single doses.", 
    "71": "The occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia was investigated in 80 children during halothane anaesthesia for adenoidectomy. Two different premedications were studied. Forty children (group A) were premedicated with diazepam 5 mg rectally and atropine 0.3-0.4 mg sublingually and 40 (group B) received a rectal solution including diazepam 0.5 mg kg-1, morphine 0.15 mg kg-1 and hyoscine 0.01 mg kg-1. In 17 of these children (nine in group A and eight in group B) plasma concentrations of catecholamines, ACTH and corticosteroids were measured. In group A the mean plasma concentration of catecholamines increased more than 300% during surgery, while it was virtually unchanged in group B (P less than 0.01). Plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol and 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were also greater in group A than in group B. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in group A was significantly more frequent (20.0%) than in group B (2.5%) (P less than 0.05). It was concluded that in these two comparable groups of patients ventricular arrhythmia during halothane anaesthesia was almost eliminated by the use of more effective premedication, as a result of decreases in the sympathetic and endocrine responses to surgery.", 
    "72": "Midazolam kinetics were determined in 11 younger (22 to 30 yr) and 11 older (50 to 60 yr) women to determine age-related differences in the kinetics of this water-soluble benzodiazepine. Midazolam, 0.2 mg/kg, was injected intravenously over 30 sec for induction of anesthesia that was maintained with 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen and intravenous fentanyl doses. There were no differences between the groups with respect to awakening times or plasma concentrations. Midazolam kinetics were described by a three-compartment open mamillary model. The only differences were small increases in the slow and total volumes of distribution in the older women. The kinetics we determined, including the steady-state volume of distribution of 1.23 l/kg and the elimination clearance of 419 ml/min, are in excellent agreement with those reported by others. Our data suggest that midazolam has advantages over other benzodiazepines, not only because of its water solubility and shorter elimination t1/2, but also because of little change in its kinetics with age.", 
    "73": "The effects of 3 mg lorazepam on polysomnographic recordings, performance, anxiety, and perceived sleep were examined. Six insomniac subjects slept in the sleep laboratory for 18 consecutive nights after having taken placebo or lorazepam.

There was some evidence of rebound insomnia after drug withdrawal, although it was not evident from all measures. Clear performance decrements occurred during lorazepam use."
