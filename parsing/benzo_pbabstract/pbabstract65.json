The uncertain oral drug taking habits may lead to relapses and rehospitalizations. Using second generation long acting injectables we have more possibilities to avoid these problems. This review attempts to present and describe the pharmacological background of the modern long acting injectables including patient cases where olanzapine pamoate long acting injectable provided remission and better quality of life for the patients.", 
    "1": "Currently detoxification of drug and alcohol dependent patients is pharmacologically unresolved, and long-term treatment following the acute phase is also not very successful including a high number of relapses. We would need medications that on the short term cease: the severe vegetative symptoms, the pain, the extremely distressing psychosyndrome characterised by restlessness, anxiety or acute depressive symptoms, and the craving. The optimal would be if there was one medication capable of simultaneously alleviating or diminishing all the above symptoms without causing dependency and preventing relapse in the long-term. Dependency is almost all cases accompanied by primary and/or secondary mood disorder or sleep disorder which should also be treated. It should be considered, however, that following withdrawal of the agent benzodiazepine dependency often develops. The serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) trazodone is effective in the treatment of depression accompanied by sleeping disorder and it has also shown efficacy in alcohol and benzodiazepine-dependency. Its administration may improve the efficacy of detoxification and treatment of following conditions, may decrease medication load and the risk of the development of benzodiazepine dependency. In our clinical practice we frequently use this agent to treat our patients simultaneously suffering from depression and addiction problems, gaining experience comparing it to other pharmacotherapies (benzodiazepines or other antidepressants). The medication is not approved for alcohol and drug dependence, however, treatment t of comorbid conditions is not against to the official recommendations. Our aim was, in addition to reviewing the literature, to share our experience which, although cannot be considered an evidence based study, we deemed worthy of publishing. We cannot, at this point, put forward a protocol addressing all related scientific problems and problems of off-label treatment, and we could not so far treat enough patients with trazodone so that our results would be statistically proven. \"Acute\" and long term treatment of dependency is not sufficiently effective with a substantial relapse rate, which is in part related to the lack of specific medication also for long term treatment. Among the available psychopharmacons, trazodone is a possible choice, since, as based on patients' reports and clinical observations, improvement of their depressive conditions and sleep problems potentially decreases the risk of relapse of drug and alcohol dependence.",

It has been generally considered that olanzapine contributes to the development of diabetes by inducing obesity and subsequent insulin resistance. In this study, we examined the effect of olanzapine and risperidone, another second generation antipsychotic, on a hamster pancreatic \u03b2 cell line, and found that both evoked mild endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by mild activation of the ER stress sensor molecule PERK. Surprisingly, only olanzapine induced marked apoptosis. Phosphorylation of the \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, an event immediately downstream of PERK activation, was not observed in cells treated with olanzapine, protein synthesis continued despite PERK activation, and ER stress was thereby sustained. Secretion of insulin was markedly inhibited, and both proinsulin and insulin accumulated inside olanzapine-treated cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis and knockdown of insulin mRNA, which result in less unfolded protein burden, both attenuated subsequent olanzapine-induced apoptosis. Given clinical observations that some patients taking olanzapine exhibit hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia without gaining weight, our observations suggest that damage to pancreatic \u03b2 cells may contribute to the undesirable metabolic consequences of olanzapine treatment in some cases.",

We report a rare patient with both Wernicke encephalopathy and disulfiram intoxication. This 50-year-old woman, who was taking disulfiram for chronic alcohol abuse, presented with an acute confusional state, dysarthria, nystagmus, supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, and paraparesis. Biochemical serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses were normal. An electromyogram detected a motor polyneuropathy. Cognitive assessment revealed severe impairment of memory, attention, and logical and executive abilities. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement showed brain lesions consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy, but also symmetric hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the globus pallidus. Stopping the disulfiram and treating with hydration, high-dose thiamine supplements, and benzodiazepines significantly improved the patient's consciousness and oculomotor function. A magnetic resonance imaging scan after 1 month of treatment showed complete disappearance of the brain lesions and the hyperintensities in the globus pallidus. After a further month of intensive neurorehabilitation, the patient was able to interact with the medical staff, and her neuropsychological tests showed only mild memory impairment. Patients with alcoholism who present at emergency departments are at high risk for misdiagnosis, especially because there is no specific routine laboratory test for detecting asymptomatic disulfiram intoxication. Although uncommon, the combination of Wernicke encephalopathy and disulfiram intoxication should be suspected in patients with alcoholism. The disorder can be detected through a careful history and prompt clinical evaluation, together with characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings.",

The conjugate was resistant to drug loss in plasma and in circulation, and had a pharmacokinetic profile closely matching that of the parental h1F6239C antibody capped with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Evaluation in CD70-positive RCC and NHL mouse xenograft models showed pronounced antitumor activities at single or weekly doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg of ADC. The ADC was tolerated at 2.5 mg/kg.

The paper aimed to investigate effect of anxiolytic, diazepam, on the level of anxiety and aggression in these animals. The drug was chronically administrated for two weeks at the process of aggression experience acquisition. It was shown that diazepam decreased anxiety but didn't influence aggression level assessed by total time of attacks. However, diazepam decreased demonstration of aggressive grooming in part of aggressive males. Group of diazepam-treated aggressive males which displayed aggressive grooming didn't differ in level of anxiety and aggression in saline-treated male mice. Diazepam had anxiolytic and pro-aggressive effects in male mice without demonstrating aggressive grooming. Thus, we can conclude that anxiolytic effect of diazepam is accompanied with increased aggression as side effect in some male mice which have repeated experience of aggression.",

Here we report a highly sensitive, selective and cost effective method for the detection of trace amounts of clonazepam based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of melamine. Hydrogen bonding interactions between clonazepam and melamine resulted in the aggregation of AuNPs and a consequent color change of AuNPs from wine red to blue. The results showed that the absorption ratio (A636/A552) was linear for clonazepam concentrations in the range of 10 \u00d7 10(-8) to 1.0 \u00d7 10(-9) M (R(2) = 0.999). The detection limit was 8.9 \u00d7 10(-10) M (S/N = 3), which was much lower than that of most existing methods. Coexisting substances including alprazolam, diazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam did not affect the determination of clonazepam. The sensor developed by this new approach could be used as a spot test and a good alternative means for on-site and real time screening of clonazepam.

    "42": "Social withdrawal is one of several negative symptoms of schizophrenia, all of which are poorly treated by current therapies. One challenge in developing agents with efficacy against negative symptoms is the lack of suitable preclinical models. The social approach test was used as the basis for developing an assay to test emerging therapies for negative symptoms. NMDA antagonists and dopamine agonists have been used extensively to produce or disrupt behaviors thought to be rodent correlates of positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The aim of these studies was to determine whether sociability of mice in the 3-chamber social approach test could be disrupted and whether this paradigm could have utility in predicting efficacy against negative symptoms. The criteria for such a model were: a lack of response to antipsychotics and attenuation by agents such as the glycine agonist, d-cycloserine, which has been shown to possess clinical efficacy against negative symptoms. Administration of the NMDA antagonists MK-801, PCP, or ketamine did not disrupt sociability. In contrast, Grin1 hypomorph mice displayed a social deficit which was not reversed by atypical antipsychotics or d-serine. d-Amphetamine disrupted sociability without stimulating locomotor activity and its effect was not reversed by antipsychotics. The GABAA inverse agonist, FG-7142, reduced sociability and this was reversed by the GABAA antagonist, flumazenil and dcycloserine, but not by clozapine, or the GABAA benzodiazepine anxiolytic, alprazolam. Based on our criteria, the GABAA model warrants further evaluation to confirm that this paradigm has utility as a preclinical model for predicting efficacy against negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",

For seizures longer than 3-5 minutes application of rectal diazepam, buccal midazolam or sublingual lorazepam is recommended. Benzodiazepines may be ineffective in some patients or cause prolonged sedation and fatigue. Preclinical investigations in a rat model provided evidence that febrile seizures may be triggered by respiratory alkalosis, which was subsequently confirmed by a retrospective clinical observation. Further, individual therapeutic interventions demonstrated that a pCO2-elevation via re-breathing or inhalation of 5% CO2 instantly stopped the febrile seizures.

Fifteen (seven male, eight female) clinically healthy mature budgerigars weighing 28.9 +/- 6.1 g were involved in the study Each bird was used three times in a randomized crossover study design with 7 days between treatments. Birds received xylazine (25.6 +/- 2.2 mg/kg), diazepam (13.6 +/- 1.1 mg/kg), or midazolam (13.2 +/- 1.3 mg/kg) intranasally (i.n.) using a micropipette. The onset time and dorsal recumbency duration time were measured and recorded. Sedation was produced in all birds after i.n. administration of xylazine, diazepam, and midazolam. Time to onset of sedation was significantly shorter after midazolam (1.3 +/- 0.44 min) compared with that after xylazine (2.6 +/- 0.89 min) and diazepam (2.8 +/- 0.88 min). Xylazine produced significantly longer duration of sedation (286.0 +/- 28.8 min) than that produced by diazepam (165.40 +/- 19.2 min) and midazolam (71.60 +/- 8.9 min). This study demonstrated that i.n. drug administration could provide fast and reliable sedation in budgerigars. Although i.n. midazolam or diazepam can provide adequate sedation for diagnostic and minor therapeutic procedures, xylazine at the dose used in this study is not recommended because the quality of sedation may be insufficient to perform a clinical procedure.",

Basic and clinical studies indicate that seizures in neonates have long-term neurodevelopmental and psychiatric consequences, highlighting the need for novel pharmacotherapeutics. First-line treatments targeting GABAA receptors, like barbiturates and benzodiazepines, are limited in their efficacy and carry significant risks to the developing brain. Here, we review the use of current GABA agonist therapies for neonatal seizures and suggest other treatment strategies given recent developments in the understanding of disease pathogenesis. One promising avenue is the indirect manipulation of the GABAergic system, via the modulation of neuronal Cl(-) gradients, by targeting the cation-Cl(-) cotransporters (NKCC1 and KCC2) or their regulatory signaling molecules. This strategy might yield a novel class of more efficacious anti-epileptics with fewer side effects by specifically addressing disease pathophysiology. Moreover, this strategy may have ramifications for other adult seizure syndromes in which GABA receptor-mediated depolarizations play a pathogenic role, such as temporal lobe epilepsy.",

The treatments proceeded for 2 weeks, after which treatment efficacies were assessed in each study group based on changes in polysomnography parameters, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and indices of HPA and HPT axes (serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, highly sensitive thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4). Further, the relapse and recurrence rates within 3 months after respective treatments were also measured. rTMS treatment significantly better (p < 0.05) improved stage III sleep and REM sleep cycle compared with both control groups. Further, rTMS treatment group was more advantageous in improving the indices of HPA and HPT axes (p < 0.05 vs. both control groups). In addition, the relapse and recurrence rates were also the lowest in rTMS treatment group. In conclusion, rTMS treatment is more advantageous than both medication and psychotherapy treatments in improving the sleep architecture.

    "83": "The plant Cannabis sativa has been used for centuries for the effects of its psychoactive resins. The term \"marijuana\" typically refers to tobacco-like preparations of the leaves and flowers. The plant contains more than 400 chemicals but the cannabinoid \u03b4-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the major psychoactive constituent. \"Hashish\" is the resin extracted from the tops of flowering plants and generally has a much higher THC concentration. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. Currently, several states have passed legislation to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for both medical and personal use and several other states have similar legislation under consideration. The most common form of marijuana use in humans is inhalation of the smoke of marijuana cigarettes, followed by ingestion. In animals, although secondhand smoke inhalation is possible, the most common source of exposure is through ingestion of the owner's marijuana supply. The minimum lethal oral dose for dogs for THC is more than 3 g/kg. Although the drug has a high margin of safety, deaths have been seen after ingestion of food products containing the more concentrated medical-grade THC butter. There are two specific cannabinoid receptors in humans and dogs, CB1 (primarily in central nervous system) and CB2 (peripheral tissues). In animals, following oral ingestion, clinical effects begin within 60 minutes. All of the neuropharmacologic mechanisms by which cannabinoids produce psychoactive effects have not been identified. However, CB1 activity is believed to be responsible for the majority of cannabinoid clinical effects. Highly lipid soluble, THC is distributed in fat, liver, brain, and renal tissue. Fifteen percent of THC is excreted into the urine and the rest is eliminated in the feces through biliary excretion. Clinical signs of canine intoxication include depression, hypersalivation, mydriasis, hypermetria, vomiting, urinary incontinence, tremors, hypothermia, and bradycardia. Higher dosages may additionally cause nystagmus, agitation, tachypnea, tachycardia, ataxia, hyperexcitability, and seizures. Treatment of marijuana ingestion in animals is largely supportive. Vital signs including temperature and heart rate and rhythm must be continually monitored. Stomach content and urine can be tested for cannabinoids. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry can be utilized for THC detection but usually may take several days and are not practical for initiation of therapy. Human urine drug-screening tests can be unreliable for confirmation of marijuana toxicosis in dogs owing to the interference of a large number of the metabolites in canine urine. False negatives may also arise if testing occurs too recently following THC ingestion. Thus, the use of human urine drug-screening tests in dogs remains controversial. No specific antidote presently exists for THC poisoning. Sedation with benzodiazepines may be necessary if dogs are severely agitated. Intravenous fluids may be employed to counter prolonged vomiting and to help control body temperature. Recently, the use of intralipid therapy to bind the highly lipophilic THC has been utilized to help reduce clinical signs. The majority of dogs experiencing intoxication after marijuana ingestion recover completely without sequellae. Differential diagnoses of canine THC toxicosis include human pharmaceuticals with central nervous system stimulatory effects, drugs with central nervous system depressant effects, macrolide parasiticides, xylitol, and hallucinogenic mushrooms.", 
    "84": "The American Psychiatric Association estimates that 3-7% of US school-aged children exhibit attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Adderall(\u00ae) (amphetamine dextroamphetamine) and a variety of brand names and generic versions of this combination are available by prescription to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. Both immediate and sustained release products are used as are single agent amphetamine medication. Knowing the exact agent ingested can provide information of dose labeled and length of clinical effects. These drugs are used off label by college students for memory enhancement, test taking ability, and for study marathons. These agents are DEA Schedule II controlled substances with high potential for abuse. For humans with ADHD or narcolepsy, standard recommended dosage is 5-60 mg daily. Amphetamine and its analogues stimulate the release of norepinephrine affecting both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor sites. \u03b1-Adrenergic stimulation causes vasoconstriction and an increase in total peripheral resistance. \u03b2-Adrenergic receptor stimulation leads to an increase in heart rate, stroke volume, and skeletal muscle blood flow. Clinical signs of Adderall(\u00ae) overdose in humans and dogs include hyperactivity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, mydriasis, tremors, and seizures. In addition, Adderall intoxication in dogs has been reported to cause hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, hypersegmentation of neutrophils, and mild thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis can be confirmed by detecting amphetamine in stomach contents or vomitus, or by positive results obtained in urine tests for illicit drugs. Treatment is directed at controlling life-threatening central nervous system and cardiovascular signs. Seizures can be controlled with benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, pentobarbital, and propofol. Cardiac tachyarrhythmias can be managed with a \u03b2-blocker such as propranolol. Intravenous fluids counter the hyperthermia, assist in maintenance of renal function, and help promote the elimination of amphetamine and its analogues. Prognosis after poisoning with Adderall(\u00ae) depends upon the severity and duration of clinical signs at presentation. Differential diagnoses that should be considered in cases of suspected amphetamine overdose are any other agents that can cause central nervous system stimulation, tremors, and seizures. This article discusses our present understanding of Adderall(\u00ae) intoxication and examines 3 dogs presented to our practice after ingestion of large amounts of the drug.",

Acute hyponatremia was induced in C57/BL6 mice by intraperitoneal injection of dDAVP and water loading. Hyponatremic mice displayed an increased frequency of epileptiform spikes on EEG and 5/9 hyponatremic mice displayed electrographic seizures. After kainic acid (20mg/kg) treatment, hyponatremic mice displayed significantly longer time with electrographic seizure activity, which was also seen after treatment with diazepam (20mg/kg).

We seek to determine whether macaque area 32 has subgenual and pregenual subdivisions and the extent to which they are comparable to those in humans by means of NeuN immunohistochemistry and multireceptor analysis of laminar profiles. The macaque has areas s32 and p32. In s32, layer IIIa/b neurons are larger than those of layer IIIc. This relationship is reversed in p32. Layer Va is thicker and Vb thinner in s32. Area p32 contains higher kainate, benzodiazepine (BZ), and serotonin (5-HT)1A but lower N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and \u03b12 receptor densities. Most differences were found in layers I, II, and VI. Together, these differences support the dual nature of macaque area 32. Comparative analysis of human and macaque s32 and p32 supports equivalences in cyto- and receptor architecture. Although there are differences in mean areal receptor densities, there are considerable similarities at the layer level. Laminar receptor distribution patterns in each area are comparable in the two species in layers III-Va for kainate, NMDA, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B , BZ, and 5-HT1A receptors.

    "110": "Acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) potentially offers a nonpharmacological approach to reduce high blood pressure (BP). However, ~70% of the patients and animal subjects respond to EA, while 30% do not. EA acts, in part, through an opioid mechanism in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM) to inhibit sympathoexcitatory reflexes induced by gastric distention. CCK-8 opposes the action of opioids during analgesia. Therefore, we hypothesized that CCK-8 in the rVLM antagonizes EA modulation of sympathoexcitatory cardiovascular reflex responses. Male rats anesthetized with ketamine and \u03b1-chloralose subjected to repeated gastric distension every 10 min were examined for their responsiveness to EA (2 Hz, 0.5 ms, 1-4 mA) at P5-P6 acupoints overlying median nerve. Repeated gastric distension every 10 min evoked consistent sympathoexcitatory responses. EA at P5-P6 modulated gastric distension-induced responses. Microinjection of CCK-8 in the rVLM reversed the EA effect in seven responders. The CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide microinjected into the rVLM converted six nonresponders to responders by lowering the reflex response from 21 \u00b1 2.2 to 10 \u00b1 2.9 mmHg (first vs. second application of EA). The EA modulatory action in rats converted to responders with devazepide was reversed with rVLM microinjection of naloxone (n = 6). Microinjection of devazepide in the absence of a second application of EA did not influence the primary pressor reflexes of nonresponders. These data suggest that CCK-8 antagonizes EA modulation of sympathoexcitatory cardiovascular responses through an opioid mechanism and that inhibition of CCK-8 can convert animals that initially are unresponsive to EA to become responsive.",

During each study period, 24 h before and after the administration of midazolam, urine samples were collected at 12-h intervals for metabolomic analyses. We derived an equation to predict midazolam clearance (CL) based on several of these markers. We demonstrated that a combination of the concentrations and ratios of several endogenous metabolites and the CYP3A5*3 genotype is a reliable predictive marker of hepatic CYP3A activity as assessed by i.v. administration of midazolam.",

With a Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale score of 43 on admission, treatment with olanzapine reduced this score to 2, by discharge.", 
    "113": "To investigate the mechanism of the metabolic disturbance induced by the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, we examined whether adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus and hepatic glucose production are involved in the effect of olanzapine.", 
    "114": "Male 6-week-old ICR mice were used. Blood glucose levels were determined by the glucose oxidase method. The mRNA levels of gluconeogenic or glycolytic enzymes were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). AMPK expression was measured by Western blotting.", 
    "115": "Systemic injection of olanzapine increased blood glucose levels in both unfasted and fasted mice. However, the increase in fasted mice was less than that in unfasted mice. Central administration of olanzapine also increased the blood glucose levels in unfasted mice, but not in fasted mice. In a pyruvate tolerance test, olanzapine significantly increased blood glucose levels. In addition, olanzapine increased the mRNA levels of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), a gluconeogenic enzyme, in the liver. Furthermore, olanzapine increased phosphorylated AMPK in the hypothalamus of unfasted mice, and olanzapine-induced hyperglycaemia was inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Central administration of the AMPK activator AICAR significantly increased G6Pase mRNA levels in the liver and blood glucose levels. Moreover, both olanzapine- and AICAR-induced hyperglycaemia were attenuated by the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, suggesting that olanzapine and AICAR induce hepatic glucose production through the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "116": "Our results indicate that olanzapine activates AMPK in the hypothalamus, which increases hepatic glucose production via the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "117": "Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant drug that binds to the \u03b1\u2082\u03b4 (alpha2delta) subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel in central nervous system (CNS). Pregabalin decreases the release of neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Purpose of this paper is to offer a qualitative overview of the studies currently available in literature about this drug, examining the effectiveness of pregabalin in its various fields of application. Our analysis, conducted on a final selection of 349 scientific papers, shows that pregabalin may help to reduce pain in diabetic neuropathy, in post-herpetic neuralgia and in some patients affected by fibromyalgia. It is also effective for the treatment of diverse types of seizures and has similar efficacy to benzodiazepines and venlafaxine in anxiety disorder. Moreover, pregabalin may be a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol abuse, in both withdrawal phase and relapse prevention. Possible implications in the treatment of benzodiazepines dependence are emerging, but a potential abuse or misuse of the drug has also been reported. Range of dosage may fluctuate considerably, from 75 mg to 600 mg per day. Further studies are needed to completely understand pregabalin mechanism of action in the different diseases.", 
    "118": "Atypical antipsychotics have been documented to be effective in the management of delirium in adults and older children, but despite considerable need, their use has been less studied in the very young. A retrospective chart review was undertaken to describe the use of atypical antipsychotics in controlling symptoms of delirium in infants and toddlers.", 
    "119": "All psychiatric inpatient consultations performed during a 3 year period were reviewed to identify children <36 months old diagnosed with delirium. Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) scores were retrospectively calculated when the antipsychotic was initiated and discontinued, to confirm the diagnosis of delirium and evaluate symptom severity, and then to assess symptom response to pharmacologic intervention.", 
    "120": "There were 10 boys and 9 girls in the study population (ages 7-30 months, mean 20.5 months). Olanzapine (n=16) and risperidone (n=3) were used, and length of treatment and response were comparable for both medications. Mean DRS scores decreased significantly (p<0.001) with antipsychotic administration, without significant adverse side effects.",

    "124": "A randomized, double-blind study was conducted in US veterans with alcohol withdrawal (DSM-IV criteria). Subjects requiring hospitalization or taking benzodiazepines or nonbenzodiazepine anticonvulsants were excluded. Twenty-six participants were randomized: 17 received gabapentin and 9 received chlordiazepoxide. Gabapentin doses were 1200 mg orally for 3 days, followed by 900 mg, 600 mg, and 300 mg for 1 day each. Chlordiazepoxide doses were 100 mg orally for 3 days, followed by 75 mg, 50 mg, and 25 mg for 1 day each. CIWA-Ar, ESS, PACS scales and evaluation for ataxia were administered daily.",

CIWA-Ar scores were reduced similarly in both groups. Ataxia was not observed. No significant adverse events were noted. Limitations include our small sample size and 35% loss to follow-up at the end of the treatment period.", 
    "126": "In ambulatory veterans with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, gabapentin treatment resulted in significantly greater reduction in sedation (ESS) and a trend to reduced alcohol craving (PACS) by the end of treatment compared to chlordiazepoxide treatment. Although limited by the small sample size, the suggestion of reduction in sleepiness and less craving warrants replication of the study with a larger sample.", 
    "127": "Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is a syndrome associated with brain trauma, stroke, encephalitis, and other forms of brain injury. It is characterized by uncontrolled episodes of unbalanced sympathetic surges causing hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, and dystonic posturing. Patients who develop paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity have worse neurologic outcomes, longer hospital stays, and more complications. Despite the clear negative impact on outcome, consensus regarding diagnostic criteria, risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment approaches is lacking. Recently, the importance of consensus regarding diagnostic criteria has been emphasized, and new theories of pathophysiology have been proposed. Many treatment options are available, but only a few systemic studies of the efficacy of treatment algorithms exist. Treatments should focus on decreasing the frequency and intensity of episodes with regularly scheduled doses of medications, such as long-acting benzodiazepines, nonselective \u03b2-blockers, \u03b12-agonists, morphine, baclofen, and gabapentin, usually in combination. Treatment of acute breakthrough episodes should focus on doses of as-needed morphine and short-acting benzodiazepines. A balance between control of symptoms without oversedation is the goal.", 
    "128": "Strong evidence indicates that impaired cognition is a core element of depression, and antidepressant treatment may ameliorate cognitive impairments experienced by depressive patients. Present study was performed to investigate effects of chronic tianeptine (5 mg/kg) or olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) administration on cognitive behaviors of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-exposed mice and to compare these effects to those induced by widely used SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine (15 mg/kg) in mice.", 
    "129": "To investigate effects of these drugs, the Morris water maze test (MWM), elevated plus maze test (EPM) and radial arm maze test (RAM) were used. The effects of stress and drugs on gene expression in the hippocampus was determined by quantitative Real Time-PCR.", 
    "130": "In MWM test, fluoxetine significantly increased escape latency of non-stressed mice in acquisition sessions and decreased time spent in escape platform quadrant in probe trial; tianeptine and olanzapine decreased enhancement in escape latency, and only olanzapine significantly enhanced attenuation in time spent in the escape platform quadrant in UCMS-exposed mice. In EPM test, all drugs significantly decreased enhancement in transfer latency in UCMS-exposed mice. In RAM test, fluoxetine significantly increased number of errors made by both non-stressed and UCMS-exposed mice.", 
    "131": "Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that CREB and BDNF gene expression levels were significantly decreased in UCMS-exposed group, and this effect was significantly reversed by each of drugs tested. Our results seem to be test dependent and should be further investigated using different learning and memory tasks.", 
    "132": "Using a prospective, randomized study design we demonstrate that midazolam sedation minimizes acidosis compared with physical restraint in captive juvenile estuarine crocodiles during handling or noninvasive procedures at preferred body temperature. A dose of midazolam (5.0 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly into the forelimb of 20 male estuarine crocodiles weighing 2-3.5 kg. Their heart and respiratory rate and degree of sedation were monitored until recovery and then daily for 7 subsequent days. Blood samples were taken at 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 min. We recorded lactate, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2), hematocrit, glucose, and blood pH. A second group (1.9-2.6 kg) was physically restrained for 5 min and the same parameters recorded. Physically restrained animals demonstrated elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, glucose, lactate, and anion gap compared with the midazolam-treated group. Physically restrained animals had lower pH, bicarbonate, and partial pressure of CO2 compared with the midazolam-treated group. Behavior in the physically restrained group in the days following the study was disrupted, with reluctance to feed and bask, compared with midazolam-treated animals whose behavior was normal. We conclude that midazolam administered in the forelimb of captive estuarine crocodiles of 2-3.5 kg provides predictable onset and duration of sedation enabling physical examination, sample collection, and translocation of the animals with minimal disturbance to lactate, pH, and CO2. Behavior following recovery appears normal.",

Among all the new compounds screened (2R,11aS)-10-((4-bromothiophen-2-yl)methyl)-2-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e]pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]diazepine-5,11(10H,11aH)dione, 5v (IC\u2085\u2080: 0.272 \u03bcM) emerged as most active non-carboxylic acid ACE inhibitor with minimal toxicity comparable to clinical drugs Lisinopril, Benazepril and Ramipril. Favorable binding characteristics in docking studies also supported the experimental results.", 
    "134": "Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in red blood cells (RBCs) from sickle cell disease (SCD) patients is increased compared to levels in normal individuals and may participate in the anaemic and ischaemic complications of SCD. Exposure is increased by deoxygenation and occurs with elevation of intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a to low micromolar levels. The Ca\u00b2\u207a entry step has not been defined but a role for the deoxygenation-induced pathway, Psickle, is postulated. Partial Psickle inhibitors 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (SITS), 4,4'-dithiocyano-2,2'-stilbene-disulphonic acid (DIDS) and dipyridamole inhibited deoxygenation-induced PS exposure (DIDS IC50, 118 nM). Inhibitors and activators of other pathways (including these stimulated by depolarisation, benzodiazepines, glutamate and stretch) were without effect. Zn\u00b2\u207a and Gd\u00b3\u207a stimulated PS exposure to high levels. In the case of Zn\u00b2\u207a, this effect was independent of oxygen (and hence HbS polymerisation and RBC sickling) but required extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a. The effect was completely abolished when Zn\u00b2\u207a (100 \u03bcM) was added to RBCs suspended in autologous plasma, implying a requirement of high levels of free Zn\u00b2\u207a.", 
    "135": "The aim of this observational study was to obtain information regarding efficacy and safety of add-on levetiracetam (LEV; n=32) in Japanese patients with refractory partial seizures in an everyday clinical setting, relative to control AEDs (n=30). This is the first study of LEV add-on therapy conducted in Japan since approval was made. The medical charts of patients were retrospectively reviewed. The efficacy variables were seizure freedom and \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency. A significantly higher response to LEV was demonstrated in patients with all seizure types at baseline, relative to control AEDs. In patients with a duration of epilepsy of at least 10 years, significant effects in response to LEV were demonstrated with regards to efficacy variables, relative to control AEDs, thus providing meaningful results. Only two patients (6.2%) discontinued LEV treatment due to worsening of seizures, but no discontinuation was reported due to adverse events. LEV as add-on therapy to other AEDs is a promising useful treatment option for patients with refractory partial seizures without notable effects on safety, indicating that this treatment regimen might be recommended for such patients.", 
    "136": "The lung provides a portal of entry that could be used to rapidly deliver anticonvulsant substances to the brain to treat seizures. In the present study, we demonstrate that midazolam, a water-soluble anticonvulsant benzodiazepine, confers potent seizure protection when administered via the intrapulmonary route. High dose (100 mg/kg) intraperitoneal midazolam induced loss-of-righting reflex in mice. Lower doses of midazolam (100-1000 \u03bcg/kg) when administered intraperitoneally did not induce loss-of-righting reflex but protected animals against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. Intrapulmonary administration of midazolam via a tracheal cannula protected against intraperitoneal PTZ seizures at lower doses. The minimal intraperitoneal and intravenous doses of midazolam required to elevate the threshold for seizure signs induced by intravenous PTZ were 500 and 100 \u03bcg/kg, respectively, whereas the minimal intrapulmonary midazolam dose was 12.5 \u03bcg/kg. Intratracheal midazolam caused a large increase in intravenous PTZ threshold 5 min after administration but the effect declined rapidly over 60 min and no antiseizure activity was evident at 120 min. The minimal intraperitoneal doses of midazolam required to elevate the threshold for seizure signs induced by intravenous picrotoxin and kainic acid were 100 and 2000 \u03bcg/kg, respectively; the corresponding values for intratracheal midazolam were 25 and 100 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. We conclude that midazolam is a highly effective anticonvulsant when administered by the intrapulmonary route. Midazolam is substantially more potent when delivered into the lung than when administered intraperitoneally or intravenously. Inhalation could be an alternative to other routes of administration for the delivery of midazolam to rapidly abort acute seizures.", 
    "137": "Nighttime food intake is associated with weight gain and higher HbA1c levels. We experienced night eaters who have no memory of their nocturnal eating in the morning. In this study, the curious night eating behavior was designated as \"unremembered nocturnal eating syndrome (UNES)\". We screened 1,169 patients with diabetes for sleep quality and abnormal eating behavior at night using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire with an additional question regarding UNES. When abnormal nocturnal eating behavior was noted, detailed clinical information was extracted from interviews with the patients. We identified 9 patients who experienced UNES. They had a higher BMI compared with subjects who reported no such episodes. Among them, 6 patients who consumed food at night without memory 2-5 times per month or more had significantly higher HbA1c levels. Continuous glucose monitoring in a patient with type 1 diabetes revealed an abrupt elevation of glucose levels from midnight when some foods were consumed. Eight of the 9 patients were taking benzodiazepine and/or non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents when they experienced the episodes. The prevalence of UNES was 0.8% in all subjects and 4% in those taking hypnotic drugs. The ratio of hypnotic drug use in subjects with UNES was significantly higher than for individuals without UNES (89% vs. 17%, p<0.0001). Although UNES seems to be etiologically heterogeneous, hypnotics-induced parasomnia and/or anterograde amnesia may be associated with the behavior. UNES is not rare in diabetic patients on hypnotic medicine and may be a hidden cause of unexpected morning hyperglycemia.",

Also, in case of the need of sedatives, choose the most appropiate for the patient needs, avoiding the use of benzodiazepines and identify risk factors for delirium, in order to prevent its occurrence, diagnose delirium and treat it with the most suitable pharmacological agent, whether it is haloperidol, atypical antipsychotics or dexmedetomidine, once again, avoiding the use of benzodiazepines and decreasing the use of opioids.",

We diagnosed her case as depression with high levels of anxiety, weakness, with diminished ability to think or concentrate and with a sensory-motor disorder. Although this last symptom was very distressing, it did not satisfy the criteria for RLS (Restless Legs Syndrome). After treatment with paroxetine (20 mg) and zolpidem (10 mg), anxiety and mood deflection were attenuated. Nevertheless, a mild depression, an intermittent awakening (fragmentation of the sleep-wake rhythm) and subsyndromal RLS persisted. Her resistant insomnia was treated with benzodiazepine sleeping drugs (triazolam 0.25 mg, lorazepam 2.5 mg, fluorazepam 30 mg) with only partial insomnia remission, antidepressants (trazodone 150 mg RP, mirtazapine 15-30 mg, agomelatine 50 mg) and antipsychotics (levomepromazine 25 mg, zuclopentixol 25 mg) without results. Her intractable insomnia was markedly responsive to pregabalin without side effects. Our hypothesis is that the therapy with pregabalin may be indicated for resistant insomnia associated with subsyndromal RLS, even when the latter does not satisfy fully all the criteria for diagnosis.", 
    "148": "Outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unsatisfactory, and novel treatments are urgently needed. One strategy explores antibodies and their drug conjugates, particularly those targeting CD33. Emerging data with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) demonstrate target validity and activity in some patients with AML, but efficacy is limited by heterogeneous drug conjugation, linker instability, and a high incidence of multidrug resistance. We describe here the development of SGN-CD33A, a humanized anti-CD33 antibody with engineered cysteines conjugated to a highly potent, synthetic DNA cross-linking pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer via a protease-cleavable linker. The use of engineered cysteine residues at the sites of drug linker attachment results in a drug loading of approximately 2 pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers per antibody. In preclinical testing, SGN-CD33A is more potent than GO against a panel of AML cell lines and primary AML cells in vitro and in xenotransplantation studies in mice. Unlike GO, antileukemic activity is observed with SGN-CD33A in AML models with the multidrug-resistant phenotype. Mechanistic studies indicate that the cytotoxic effects of SGN-CD33A involve DNA damage with ensuing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Together, these data suggest that SGN-CD33A has CD33-directed antitumor activity and support clinical testing of this novel therapeutic in patients with AML.", 
    "149": "Benzodiazepine (BZD) use is widespread among opioid-maintained patients worldwide. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to investigate motives and patterns of BZD use and psychiatric comorbidity in a convenience sample of patients (n=193) maintained on oral opioid agonists or diacetylmorphine (DAM). Prolonged BZD use and high-risk behaviors like parenteral use were common. After principal component analysis, motives were divided into those related to negative affect regulation, positive affect regulation (i.e. reward-seeking) and somato-medical problems. Negative affect regulation and somato-medical motives were associated with prolonged use. Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with several self-therapeutic motives, most importantly to lose anxiety. Patients maintained on DAM were more likely to be ex-users of BZD and report high positive affect regulation. Therefore, patients maintained on different agonists may have deviating motives for BZD use, which could be of importance when addressing this issue. Treatment of psychiatric comorbidity, in particular anxiety, depressive and sleeping disorders, may be helpful in reducing BZD use, particularly in patients maintained on oral opioids.",

In the course of screening for PTP1B inhibitory fungal metabolites, the organic extracts of several fungal species isolated from marine environments were found to exhibit significant inhibitory effects, and the bioassay-guided investigation of these extracts resulted in the isolation of fructigenine A (1), cyclopenol (2), echinulin (3), flavoglaucin (4), and viridicatol (5). The structures of these compounds were determined mainly by analysis of NMR and MS data. These compounds inhibited PTP1B activity with 50% inhibitory concentration values of 10.7, 30.0, 29.4, 13.4, and 64.0 micrometer, respectively. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of PTP1B inhibition by compounds 1 and 5 suggested that compound 1 inhibited PTP1B activity in a noncompetitive manner, whereas compound 5 inhibited PTP1B activity in a competitive manner.",

    "164": "The anticompulsive potential of agomelatine, a potent MT1/2 receptor agonist, and its combined effect with m-chlorophenylpiperazine hydrochloride (mCPP), bicuculline, and diazepam, were investigated in male C57BLJ/6 mice using marble-burying behavior (MBB) test. Acute administration of agomelatine (30-40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) significantly inhibited the MBB in mice without influencing their locomotor activity. Further, chronic (28 days) administration of lower doses of agomelatine (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently reduced the MBB without influencing their locomotor activity. Interaction studies revealed that pretreatment with mCPP (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), a serotonin 5HT2C agonist, partially attenuated the anticompulsive effect of agomelatine (30 mg/kg). Further, a GABAA receptor agonist (diazepam, 1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) and antagonist (bicuculline, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) had no influence on the effects of agomelatine on MBB and locomotor activity. The doses of modulators were selected on the basis of dose-response studies. The results indicate that agomelatine has a potent anticompulsive effect that can be attributed to 5HT2C antagonism and MT1/2 agonism, and is certainly not mediated via its effects on the GABAergic system. Thus, the study adds to the growing literature on the psychopharmacological effects of agomelatine, and warrants further exploration in multiple paradigms.",

It is known that hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is increased in these patients and corticosteroids levels are augmented, whereas the anxiolytic actions of diazepam are reduced. The aim of this study was to evaluate the participation of glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors in anxiety in diabetic mice and whether the blockade of these receptors synergizes with diazepam in the diabetic condition, leading to a reduction of anxiety. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) and anxiety-like levels were evaluated on days 5, 15, and 30 after STZ. Independent groups of control and diabetic mice were treated with diazepam (0.25-2.0 mg/kg), RU-486 (12.5-100 mg/kg), spironolactone (12.5-100 mg/kg), or the combination of suboptimal doses of diazepam and MR or GR antagonists. Results showed that STZ increased anxiety-like behavior 15 days after its administration. The response to diazepam was reduced in diabetic mice, whereas GR and MR blockade induced anxiolytic-like effects in these animals. Coadministration of MR or GR antagonists synergized with diazepam to induce anxiolytic-like effects. The results suggest the participation of corticosteroid receptors in the increased anxiety-like response in diabetic mice and that the blockade of these receptors facilitates the effects of diazepam.",

However, there is a paucity of data on the effects of pediatric dental sedations after discharge of children from the dental office. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the incidence of adverse events occurring with meperidine and hydroxyzine versus midazolam alone 8 and 24 hours after sedation in pediatric dental patients. In this prospective study, a convenience sample of 46 healthy children presenting to a private pediatric dental practice for dental treatment needs was selected. A telephone survey of the parents of children sedated with either meperidine and hydroxyzine or midazolam alone was conducted 8 and 24 hours after the administration of sedation medications. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, frequency and proportion analysis, and Fisher exact test. Forty children were sedated with meperidine and hydroxyzine, and 6 who were sedated with midazolam. In both groups, 50% of the children slept in the car on the way home. Three children in the meperidine and hydroxyzine group vomited in the car. A significantly larger proportion of children in the meperidine and hydroxyzine group experienced prolonged sleep at home (P = .015). More children in the midazolam group exhibited irritability in the first 8 hours (P = .07). There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups with respect to incidence of pain, fever, vomiting, sleeping in the car, snoring, and difficulty in waking up. The lingering effects of orally administered sedation medications can lead to prolonged sleep, irritability, and vomiting in children after they have been discharged from the dental clinic.

    "179": "It was established that mexidol (100 mg/kg, i.v.) in contrast to cytoflavin (1 ml/kg, i.v.) and reamberin (100 mg/kg, i.v.) produced analgesic effect in rabbits by raising pain threshold under electric stimulation of dental pulp. Mexidol (200 mg/kg, i.p.) also raised the nociceptive threshold of the same tail stimulation by in rats (vocalization test). Non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptor complex, MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), and selective GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) decrease the effect of mexidol. Therefore, the antinociceptive effect of mexidol in rats is mediated by the NMDA receptor complex and GABAA receptors. It was also found that mexidol (microiontophoretic application) produced inhibiting effect on spontaneous and evoked (caused by nociceptive electric stimulation of hind paw) activity of neurons (major part) of sensorimotor cortex and ventral posterior thalamic nucleus in rabbits. On the background of MK-801 and GABA blockers (bicuculline and picrotoxin), this action of mexidol was completely prevented or considerably decreased (by almost 80 and 60% of cells, respectively). Therefore, the effect of mexidol on these neurons is realized by inhibiting ion currents through NMDA receptor complex and via GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.",

Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and up to 85% of patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among anticonvulsants, valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may be poorly tolerated by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant women. Alternatives have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but also topiramate, zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy may be useful or even required. One should not forget the potential aggravation induced not only by some commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, but also, in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special settings, older drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But the management of JME should also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict avoidance of sleep deprivation and the management of copathologies, including the cognitive and psychiatric problems that are often encountered. With adequate management, there will only remain a small proportion of patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its related problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician has a fair chance of significantly helping the patient with medication and counseling.",

The use of olanzapine was found to be effective to reduce both delusions and body distortions, and to improve compliance to treatments. We found a severe delusional symptomatology with mystic, omnipotence and persecution features. The psychotic structure seemed preceding the eating disorder and was also found to be worsened by emaciation. The use of antipsychotic helped reducing delusional symptoms and improving compliance to treatments.

    "191": "The prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the USA is estimated at approximately 4-9% in children and 4% in adults. It is estimated that prescriptions for ADHD medications are written for more than 2.7 million children per year. In 2010, US poison centers reported 17,000 human exposures to ADHD medications, with 80% occurring in children <19 years old and 20% in adults. The drugs used for the treatment of ADHD are diverse but can be roughly separated into two groups: the stimulants such as amphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil; and the non-stimulants such as atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine. This review focuses on mechanisms of toxicity after overdose with ADHD medications, clinical effects from overdose, and management. Amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methylphenidate act as substrates for the cellular monoamine transporter, especially the dopamine transporter (DAT) and less so the norepinephrine (NET) and serotonin transporter. The mechanism of toxicity is primarily related to excessive extracellular dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The primary clinical syndrome involves prominent neurological and cardiovascular effects, but secondary complications can involve renal, muscle, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal (GI) effects. In overdose, the patient may present with mydriasis, tremor, agitation, hyperreflexia, combative behavior, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, anxiety, paranoia, movement disorders, and seizures. The management of amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methylphenidate overdose is largely supportive, with a focus on interruption of the sympathomimetic syndrome with judicious use of benzodiazepines. In cases where agitation, delirium, and movement disorders are unresponsive to benzodiazepines, second-line therapies include antipsychotics such as ziprasidone or haloperidol, central alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists such as dexmedetomidine, or propofol. Modafinil is not US FDA approved for treatment of ADHD; however, it has been shown to improve ADHD signs and symptoms and has been used as an off-label pharmaceutical for this diagnosis in both adults and children. The mechanism of action of modafinil is complex and not fully understood. It is known to cause an increase in extracellular concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the neocortex. Overdose with modafinil is generally of moderate severity, with reported ingestions of doses up to 8 g. The most common neurological effects include increased anxiety, agitation, headache, dizziness, insomnia, tremors, and dystonia. The management of modafinil overdose is largely supportive, with a focus on sedation, and control of dyskinesias and blood pressure. Atomoxetine is a selective presynaptic norepinephrine transporter inhibitor. The clinical presentation after overdose with atomoxetine has generally been mild. The primary effects have been drowsiness, agitation, hyperactivity, GI upset, tremor, hyperreflexia, tachycardia hypertension, and seizure. The management of atomoxetine overdose is largely supportive, with a focus on sedation, and control of dyskinesias and seizures. Clonidine is a synthetic imidazole derivative with both central and peripheral alpha-adrenergic agonist actions. The primary clinical syndrome involves prominent neurological and cardiovascular effects, with the most commonly reported features of depressed sensorium, bradycardia, and hypotension. While clonidine is an anti-hypertensive medication, a paradoxical hypertension may occur early with overdose. The clinical syndrome after overdose of guanfacine may be mixed depending on central or peripheral alpha-adrenoreceptor effects. Initial clinical effects may be drowsiness, lethargy, dry mouth, and diaphoresis. Cardiovascular effects may depend on time post-ingestion and may present as hypotension or hypertension. The management of guanfacine overdose is largely supportive, with a focus on support of blood pressure. Overdose with ADHD medications can produce major morbidity, with many cases requiring intensive care medicine and prolonged hospital stays. However, fatalities are rare with appropriate care.", 
    "192": "Anxiety disorders (Ads) are the most common type of psychiatric disorders, Pharmacologic options studied for treating ADs may include benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSA) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Agomelatine, a new melatonergic antidepressant, has been shown effective in various types of mood disorders. Moreover, some evidence points towards a possible efficacy of such a drug in the treatment of ADs. Therefore, the aim of this review was to elucidate current (facts and views) data on the role of agomelatine in the treatment of ADs. The trials evaluating agomelatine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder are few but, overall, encouraging in regards to its efficacy. However, further randomized, placebo-controlled studies on larger samples use are needed. Apart from some interesting case reports, no large studies are, to date, present in literature regarding agomelatine in the treatment of other ADs, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Therefore, the clinical efficacy and the relative good tolerability of agomelatine in generalized anxiety (GAD) warrants further investigation in ADs.", 
    "193": "Protein kinases play important roles in tumor development and progression. Lots of kinase inhibitors have entered into market and show promising clinical benefits. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule, well-tolerated, orally active kinase inhibitor, R1498, majorly targeting both angiogenic and mitotic pathways for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastric cancer (GC). A series of biochemical and cell-based assays indicated that the target kinase cluster of R1498 included Aurora kinases and VEGFR2 et al. R1498 showed moderate in vitro growth inhibition on a panel of tumor cells with IC50 of micromole range. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of R1498 was evaluated on a panel of GC and HCC xenografts in a parallel comparison with another multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. R1498 demonstrated superior efficacy and toxicity profile over sorafenib in all test models with >80% tumor growth inhibition and tumor regression in some xenogratfts. The therapeutic potential of R1498 was also highlighted by its efficacy on three human GC primary tumor derived xenograft models with 10-30% tumor regression rate. R1498 was shown to actively inhibit the Aurora A activity in vivo, and decrease the vascularization in tumors. Furthermore, R1498 presented good in vivo exposure and therapeutic window in the pharmacokinetic and dose range finding studies. Theses evidences indicate that R1498 is a potent, well-tolerated, orally active multitarget kinase inhibitor with a unique antiangiogenic and antiproliferative profile, and provide strong confidence for further development for HCC and GC therapy.",

This study evaluated the CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interaction potential of brentuximab vedotin and the excretion of MMAE. Two 21-day cycles of brentuximab vedotin (1.2 or 1.8\u2009mg/kg intravenously) were administered to 56 patients with CD30-positive hematologic malignancies. Each patient also received either a sensitive CYP3A substrate (midazolam), an effective inducer (rifampin), or a strong inhibitor (ketoconazole). Brentuximab vedotin did not affect midazolam exposures. ADC exposures were unaffected by concomitant rifampin or ketoconazole; however, MMAE exposures were lower with rifampin and higher with ketoconazole. The short-term safety profile of brentuximab vedotin in this study was generally consistent with historic clinical observations. The most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, headache, pyrexia, and neutropenia. Over a 1-week period, \u223c23.5% of intact MMAE was recovered after administration of brentuximab vedotin; all other species were below the limit of quantitation. The primary excretion route is via feces (median 72% of the recovered MMAE). These results suggest that brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) and MMAE are neither inhibitors nor inducers of CYP3A; however, MMAE is a substrate of CYP3A.", 
    "195": "Understanding the molecular basis of drug action can facilitate development of more potent and selective drugs. Here, we explore the molecular basis for action of a unique small molecule ligand that is a type 1 cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor agonist and type 2 CCK receptor antagonist, GI181771X. We characterize its binding utilizing structurally related radioiodinated ligands selective for CCK receptor subtypes that utilize the same allosteric ligand-binding pocket, using wild-type receptors and chimeric constructs exchanging the distinct residues lining this pocket. Intracellular calcium assays were performed to determine biological activity. Molecular models for docking small molecule agonists to the type 1 CCK receptor were developed using a ligand-guided refinement approach. The optimal model was distinct from the previous antagonist model for the same receptor and was mechanistically consistent with the current mutagenesis data. This study revealed a key role for Leu(7.39) that was predicted to interact with the isopropyl group in the N1 position of the benzodiazepine that acts as a \"trigger\" for biological activity. The molecular model was predictive of binding of other small molecule agonists, effectively distinguishing these from 1065 approved drug decoys with an area under curve value of 99%. The model also selectively enriched for agonist compounds, with 130 agonists identified by ROC analysis when seeded in 2175 non-agonist ligands of the type 1 CCK receptor (area under curve 78%). Benzodiazepine agonists in this series docked in consistent pose within this pocket, with a key role played by Leu(7.39), whereas the role of this residue was less clear for chemically distinct agonists.",

In this study we have analysed the effect of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemokine expressed to a higher level in ALS patients, on GABAA receptors in cultured cortical neurons from a genetic model of ALS (G93A) and compared with wild type SOD1 (SOD1) and their corresponding non transgenic littermates (Control). By performing electrophysiological experiments we have observed that, in cortical neurons MCP-1 (2-150 ng/ml) induced an enhancement of GABA-evoked currents that was significantly higher in G93A neurons compared to controls. The effect of MCP-1 was not dependent on the activation of its receptor CCR2, while it was blocked by flumazenil, the antagonist of benzodiazepine sites. Analysis of GABAA receptor subunit composition has indicated an altered subunit expression level in G93A cortical neurons compared to controls. Instead, in cultured spinal neurons MCP-1 induced a significant reduction of GABA-evoked currents, also through the benzodiazepine sites, indicating a region-specific mechanism of action. However, no differences were observed in the current reduction between the three neuronal populations. These findings provide the first evidence that MCP-1, acting on benzodiazepine sites, can modulate the GABA-evoked currents, depending on the subunit composition of GABA(A) receptor. In cortical neurons MCP-1 upmodulates the GABA-evoked current and this effect is exacerbated in the mutated neurons. It is reasonable to assume that the higher Cl(-) influx through GABA(A) receptors in the presence of MCP-1 in mutated cortical neurons may induce an excitotoxicity acceleration. Agents able to block the MCP-1 production may then prove useful for ALS treatment.", 
    "205": "An efficient, asymmetric synthesis of the 5-HT2C agonist vabicaserin in four chemical steps and 54% overall yield from commercially available benzodiazepine was achieved. The synthesis was highlighted by a novel oxidative, multicomponent reaction to affect the quinolinium ring assembly in one step followed by an unprecedented asymmetric hydrogenation of a 3,4-substituted quinolinium salt.",

    "208": "Ninety client owned dogs (ASA I-III, median body mass 21.5kg (IQR 10-33)) presented for anaesthesia for a variety of procedures.", 
    "209": "Dogs were randomised to receive saline 0.1\u00a0mL\u00a0kg(-1) , midazolam or diazepam at 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) . All dogs received 0.01\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) acepromazine and 0.2\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) methadone intravenously (IV). Fifteen minutes later, sedation was assessed and scored prior to anaesthetic induction. Propofol, 1\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) , was administered IV, followed by the treatment drug. Further propofol was administered until endotracheal intubation was possible. Recorded data included patient signalment, sedation score, propofol dosage and any adverse reactions.", 
    "210": "Midazolam (all groups combined) significantly reduced propofol dose requirement compared to saline (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and diazepam (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Midazolam (0.4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) ) significantly reduced propofol dose requirement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) compared to saline, however other doses failed to reach statistical significance. Diazepam did not significantly reduce propofol dose requirement compared to saline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.089). Dogs weighing <5\u00a0kg, regardless of treatment group, required a greater propofol dose than those weighing 5-40\u00a0kg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and those >40\u00a0kg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Dogs which were profoundly sedated required less propofol than those which were mildly sedated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and adequately sedated (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).", 
    "211": "Midazolam (0.4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) ) given IV after 1\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) of propofol significantly reduced the further propofol dose required for intubation compared to saline. At the investigated doses, diazepam did not have significant propofol dose sparing effects."
