We had 8 patients who were at high-risk and, therefore, shoulder arthroscopy and decompression were performed under local anesthesia in the beach-chair position. We used 50 mL of 1% lidocaine; 30 mL were infiltrated into the skin and underlying tissues and into the glenohumeral joint, and the rest was infiltrated into the subacromial joint. Before the infiltration, all patients were given 5 mg midazolam and 0.1 mg fentanyl intravenously. All 8 patients were satisfied with the analgesia provided by the anesthesia. We conclude that arthroscopy and subacromial decompression can be readily performed under local anesthesia in combination with efficient sedation.", 
    "1": "Progestins mediate the onset and duration of lordosis, the mating posture of female rodents, through actions in the hypothalamus and ventral tegmental area. In the hypothalamus, progesterone has traditional, \"genomic\" actions via intracellular progestin receptors. In the ventral tegmental area, 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one has \"non-genomic\" actions independent of progestin receptors to facilitate lordosis that involve GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors, NMDA type glutamate receptors, and/or dopamine receptors. 3alpha-Hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one levels also change with behavioral and/or environmental stimuli and may have a role in other reproductively-relevant behaviors, such as affiliation, exploration, and anxiety (socio-sexual behaviors). Data are reviewed that support the notion that: 1) effects of 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one in the midbrain ventral tegmental area facilitate lordosis and other reproductively-relevant behaviors. 2) 3alpha-Hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one, formed in the ventral tegmental area from metabolism of progestins, produced peripherally by endocrine glands, or centrally from biosynthesis in glial cells mediates socio-sexual behaviors. 3) 3alpha-Hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one's actions at GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors, NMDA type glutamate receptors, and dopamine receptors in the ventral tegmental area are important for lordosis; however, effects at these substrates on socio-sexual behaviors have not been elucidated. Given 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one's involvement in stress responses, its putative role as a homeostatic regulator and in the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders is discussed.", 
    "2": "The benzodiazepine diazepam impairs memory and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Here, we investigate the effect of diazepam on LTP of C-fiber evoked field potentials in spinal dorsal horn, which is relevant to pathological pain. LTP of C-fiber evoked field potentials was recorded in the superficial layers of spinal dorsal horn in urethane-anesthetized Sprague--Dawley rats. Diazepam was applied locally at the recording spinal segments before and after LTP induction by tetanic stimulation. We found (1) Diazepam completely blocked LTP induction. (2) Diazepam and midazolam reversed spinal LTP, when applied at 30 min after LTP induction and depressed but could not reverse spinal LTP, when applied at 3 h after LTP induction. (3) Pretreatment with benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil or GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline completely blocked the inhibitory effects of diazepam on spinal LTP. In contrast, when the inhibitory effect of diazepam was fully established, neither of these antagonists was capable of reversing the inhibition by diazepam. (4) Spinal application of the GABA(A) receptor agonist 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid (3-APSA) at a dose of 50 microg, produced a transient inhibition of spinal LTP. These results suggest that diazepam might prevent and depress spinal plastic change produced by noxious stimulation via activation of the GABA(A) -benzodiazepine receptor complex.",

    "4": "This cross-sectional study was based on 2001 annual outpatient claims data released by the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan. The claims data of each physician consultation were extracted and merged in one claim file. International Classification of Diseases (9th Edition)-Clinical Modification codes, patient's demographics, physician's specialty, the medical institution code and the content of pharmaceutical prescription constituted a file. Patients were included if they were: (i) > or =65 years of age; and (ii) coded as having 'insomnia'.", 
    "5": "Elderly insomniacs made up 216,994 of the 1,000,193 outpatient claim files we surveyed. Patients had a mean age of 74.33 years, and the sex distribution was nearly equal. Based on the data above, 11.14% of the elderly had been diagnosed as having 'insomnia' for the year 2001. This population preferred primary-care clinics over hospital-ambulatory departments; patients most frequently sought medical help from internal medicine specialists. The most popular sleep medication was lorazepam, followed by zolpidem. The first-choice off-label drug used to treat insomnia was trazodone. Hypnotics, sedatives and anxiolytics were prescribed 12.6 times more frequently than off-label used drugs. When treating insomnia with an off-label drug, physicians usually prescribed a therapeutic dosage much lower than that recommended in the package insert. Choice of sleep medication and off-label drug were most often influenced by physician specialty. Off-label prescriptions were common but not prevalent. Choice of hypnotic or sedative-anxiolytic was related to how long the drug acted and how much it cost; choice of off-label drug was related to physicians' familiarity with specific drugs and patients' characteristics. Concomitant anxiety or depression was significantly associated with higher consumption of hypnotics.", 
    "6": "Benzodiazepines and newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are still the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan. Elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.

    "8": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurological disorder involving the selective degeneration of motor neurons. In a small proportion of patients, ALS is caused by mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and mice overexpressing SOD1(G93A) mutant develop a syndrome that closely resembles the human disease. Excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate AMPA receptors has been suggested to be implicated in the selective susceptibility of motor neurons occurring in ALS. In SOD1(G93A) mice, we found that levels of GluR2 AMPA subunit, which plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of calcium impermeability of AMPA receptors, are decreased in spinal motor neurons before symptom onset in concomitance with a modest increase of GluR3 expression, a calcium-permeable AMPA subunit. This effect can result in a higher number of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors on motor neurons of SOD1(G93A) mice, predisposing these cells to be injured by AMPA-mediated glutamate firing. In support of this, we showed that treatment with a new noncompetitive AMPA antagonist, ZK 187638, partially protected motor neurons, improved motor function, and prolonged the survival of SOD1(G93A) mice.", 
    "9": "The effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists on responses to electrical stimulation of the chorda-lingual nerve were determined in pentobarbitone-anesthetized sheep and correlated to the morphology of tissue specimens. Stimulation at 2 Hz continuously, or in bursts of 1 s at 20 Hz every 10 s, for 10 min induced similar submandibular fluid responses (19 +/- 3 vs. 21 +/- 3 microl x min(-1) x g gland(-1)), whereas vasodilatation was greater during stimulation in bursts (-52 +/- 4 vs. -43 +/- 5%; P < 0.01). Continuous stimulation at 8 Hz induced substantially greater responses (66 +/- 9 microl x min(-1) x g gland(-1) and -77 +/- 3%). While atropine (0.5 mg/kg iv) abolished the secretory response at 2 and 20 Hz (1:10 s), a small response persisted at 8 Hz (<5%). The \"M1-selective\" antagonist pirenzepine (40 microg/kg iv) reduced the fluid response at all frequencies tested (P < 0.05-0.01), most conspicuously at 2 Hz (reduced by 69%). Methoctramine (\"M2/M4-selective\"; 100 microg/kg iv; n = 5) had no effect on fluid or the vascular responses but increased the protein output at 2 (+90%, P < 0.05) and 8 Hz (+45%, P < 0.05). The immunoblotting showed distinct bands for muscarinic M1, M3, M4, and M5 receptors, and immunohistochemistry showed muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors to occur in the parenchyma. Thus muscarinic M1 receptors contribute to the secretory response to parasympathetic stimulation but have little effect on the vasodilatation in the ovine submandibular gland. Increased transmitter release caused by blockade of neuronal inhibitory receptors of the M4 subtype would explain the increase in protein output.", 
    "10": "Benzodiazepines have been useful tools for investigating mechanisms underlying learning and memory. The present set of experiments investigates the role of hippocampal GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors in memory consolidation using Pavlovian fear conditioning. Rats were prepared with cannulae aimed at the dorsal hippocampus and trained with a series of white noise-shock pairings. In the first experiment, animals received intrahippocampal infusion of midazolam or vehicle immediately or 3 h after training. Then, 24 h later, freezing to the training context and the white noise were measured independently. Results show infusion of midazolam immediately, but not 3 h, after training selectively attenuates contextual fear conditioning. In the second experiment, animals received intrahippocampal infusions of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) targeting the alpha5 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor or a missense control for several days prior to training and testing. Immediately after training, animals received an infusion of either midazolam or vehicle. Western blots conducted after testing showed a significant decrease in alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptor protein. This reduction did not alter the effectiveness of midazolam immediately after training at impairing context fear memory. Therefore, alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors may not contribute to the effects of midazolam on context fear conditioning when given immediately post-training.", 
    "11": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors enhance DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) poison-induced cytotoxicity and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, but the mechanism has not been defined. We investigated the role of PARP-1 in the response to topo I poisons using PARP-1-/- and PARP-1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts and the potent PARP-1 inhibitor, AG14361 (Ki < 5 nmol/L). PARP-1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were 3-fold more sensitive to topotecan than PARP-1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (GI50, 21 and 65 nmol/L, respectively). AG14361 caused a >3-fold sensitization of PARP-1+/+ cells to topotecan compared with a <1.4-fold sensitization in PARP-1-/- cells. In human leukemia K562 cells, AG14361 caused a 2-fold sensitization to camptothecin-induced cytotoxicity. AG14361 did not affect the cellular activity of topo I as determined by measurement of cleavable complexes and topo I relaxation activity, showing that sensitization was not due to topo I activation. In contrast, repair of DNA following camptothecin removal, normally very rapid, was significantly retarded by AG14361, resulting in a 62% inhibition of repair 10 minutes after camptothecin removal. This led to a 20% increase in the net accumulation of camptothecin-induced DNA strand break levels in cells coexposed to AG14361 for 16 hours. We investigated the DNA repair mechanism involved using a panel of DNA repair-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. AG14361 significantly potentiated camptothecin-mediated cytotoxicity in all cells, except the base excision repair-deficient EM9 cells. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for the potentiation of topo I poison-mediated cytotoxicity by AG14361 is via PARP-1-dependent base excision repair.", 
    "12": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with endogenous protoporphyrin IX derived from 5-aminolevulinic acid or its derivatives has been established for treatments of several premalignancies and malignancies; however, the mechanism of the modality is not fully elucidated. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore consists mainly of the mitochondrial outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and the mitochondrial inner membrane adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). These mitochondrial proteins are responsible for the permeability transition that leads to apoptosis. In the present study, the human leukemia cell line, Reh, was treated with PDT using hexaminolevulinate (HAL). More than 80% of apoptotic Reh cells were found after HAL-mediated PDT (HAL-PDT) with high-molecular-weight (50 kbp) DNA fragmentation. Addition of PK11195 or Ro5-4864, two ligands of PBR, during HAL-PDT significantly inhibited the apoptotic effect. Bongkrekic acid, a ligand for ANT, also reduced the PDT effect. Although the mitochondrial transmembrane potential collapsed, neither cytosolic translocation of mitochondrial cytochrome c nor activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were found. However, nuclear translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was shown by both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Because AIF is the sole one among all proapoptotic factors involved in caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways that induces the high-molecular-weight DNA fragmentation, we conclude that HAL-PDT specifically targets PBR, leading to apoptosis of the Reh cells through nuclear translocation of mitochondrial AIF. This study suggests PBR as a possible novel therapeutic target for HAL-based PDT of cancer.", 
    "13": "Treatment-refractory early-onset schizophrenia is a rare but severe form of the disorder associated with poor premorbid function and long-term disability. The currently available evidence suggests that clozapine remains the most efficacious treatment for the amelioration of both positive and negative symptoms of the disorder and problematic aggressive behaviors. Clozapine use in children and adolescents, however, is limited by its association with hematologic adverse events and an increased frequency of seizure activity. Further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of antipsychotic combinations and of augmentation therapies to antipsychotic medications in order to treat persistent residual psychotic symptoms in children and adolescents who have schizophrenia and who have not responded to several sequential trials of antipsychotic monotherapy.", 
    "14": "The clearances of oral and intravenous alfentanil are in vivo probes for assessing first-pass and hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity. Clearance determinations require time-consuming and expensive serial blood samples and quantitative analysis. This investigation tested the hypothesis that a single concentration measurement can accurately predict alfentanil clearance and compared limited sampling results for alfentanil and midazolam.", 
    "15": "Data were analyzed from 2 previous studies in healthy volunteers (n = 10 in each). By use of a dose-finding protocol, subjects received oral alfentanil (23, 30, 43, or 75 microg/kg). By use of a CYP3A modulation protocol, subjects received oral or intravenous alfentanil and midazolam after pretreatment with rifampin (INN, rifampicin) (CYP3A induction), troleandomycin (CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit juice (intestinal CYP3A inhibition), or nothing (control). Alfentanil and midazolam area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated by noncompartmental analysis. Correlations between AUC and plasma concentration at each time point were evaluated by unweighted and weighted (1/y, 1/y(2)) linear regression, and the optimal weight and sampling time were determined.", 
    "16": "Correlations between AUC and plasma concentration were best with 1/y(2) weights. Optimal correlations were at 1.5 to 2 hours for each alfentanil dose and also in an all-dose composite analysis. With the CYP3A modulation protocol, correlations for the control, grapefruit juice, rifampin, and troleandomycin sessions were optimal at 2, 3, 1.5, and 12 hours, respectively, for oral alfentanil, at 2, 3, 0.5, and 9 hours, respectively, for intravenous alfentanil, at 5, 5, 1.5, and 13 hours, respectively, for oral midazolam, and at 3, 1.75, 1, and 13 hours, respectively, for intravenous midazolam. In a composite analysis of all treatments, correlations (oral and intravenous) were optimal at 4 to 5 hours for alfentanil and 5 to 6 hours for midazolam. AUC estimated by a single-point concentration was highly predictive of measured AUC (r(2) = 0.91 and 0.93 for oral and intravenous alfentanil, respectively, and r(2) = 0.90 and 0.87 for oral and intravenous midazolam, respectively). CYP3A induction or inhibition was detected equally well by single-point alfentanil concentrations and by formal AUC determinations.", 
    "17": "A single plasma concentration can predict alfentanil AUC and hence clearance, independent of dose, and thus appears to be an effective and efficient strategy for assessing CYP3A modulation over a broad spectrum of enzyme activity.", 
    "18": "Acute effects of lorazepam on visual information processing, perceptual priming and explicit memory are well established. However, visual processing and perceptual priming have rarely been explored in long-term lorazepam users. By exploring these functions it was possible to test the hypothesis that difficulty in processing visual information may lead to deficiencies in perceptual priming. Using a simple blind procedure, we tested explicit memory, perceptual priming and visual perception in 15 long-term lorazepam users and 15 control subjects individually matched according to sex, age and education level. Explicit memory, perceptual priming, and the identification of fragmented pictures were found to be preserved in long-term lorazepam users, contrary to what is usually observed after an acute drug intake. The processing of visual contour, on the other hand, was still significantly impaired. These results suggest that the effects observed on low-level visual perception are independent of the acute deleterious effects of lorazepam on perceptual priming. A comparison of perceptual priming in subjects with low- vs. high-level identification of new fragmented pictures further suggests that the ability to identify fragmented pictures has no influence on priming. Despite the fact that they were treated with relatively low doses and far from peak plasma concentration, it is noteworthy that in long-term users memory was preserved.", 
    "19": "We investigated the propagation of population pharmacokinetic information across clinical studies by applying Bayesian techniques. The aim was to summarize the population pharmacokinetic estimates of a study in appropriate statistical distributions in order to use them as Bayesian priors in consequent population pharmacokinetic analyses. Various data sets of simulated and real clinical data were fitted with WinBUGS, with and without informative priors. The posterior estimates of fittings with non-informative priors were used to build parametric informative priors and the whole procedure was carried on in a consecutive manner. The posterior distributions of the fittings with informative priors where compared to those of the meta-analysis fittings of the respective combinations of data sets. Good agreement was found, for the simulated and experimental datasets when the populations were exchangeable, with the posterior distribution from the fittings with the prior to be nearly identical to the ones estimated with meta-analysis. However, when populations were not exchangeble an alternative parametric form for the prior, the natural conjugate prior, had to be used in order to have consistent results. In conclusion, the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis may be summarized in Bayesian prior distributions that can be used consecutively with other analyses. The procedure is an alternative to meta-analysis and gives comparable results. It has the advantage that it is faster than the meta-analysis, due to the large datasets used with the latter and can be performed when the data included in the prior are not actually available.", 
    "20": "The N-acetylation of the noncompetitive AMPA antagonist talampanel (TLP) represents a route of varying significance in various species. For a detailed analysis in humans, plasma concentrations of TLP and its N-acetyl metabolite (NAc-TLP) were measured for up to 48 h after administration of a single oral dose of 75 mg in 28 healthy volunteers following genotyping for the N-acetyltansferase NAT2 isozymes (alleles NAT2*4, *5, *6, and *7). Unified parent-metabolite pharmacokinetic (PK) models that allowed three different rates of acetylation were used to simultaneously fit plasma levels for both the parent drug and its metabolite following genotype-based classification as slow, intermediate, or fast acetylator. A perfect correspondence was found between the phenotype inferred from genotyping and the phenotype determined by using plasma metabolite-to-parent molar ratios indicating that this route of metabolism is indeed mediated by NAT2. Linear parent-metabolite PK models (first-order input, first-order elimination through two parallel routes one of which is through a metabolite with polymorphic rate of formation) gave adequate and sufficiently consistent fit. Parameters obtained suggest that for TLP in humans, N-acetylation represents only about 1/4th of the total elimination even in true (*4/*4 homozygous) fast acetylators, acetylation is about 8-12 times faster in fast and 3-6 times faster in intermediate acetylators than in slow acetylators, and the N-acetyl metabolite is eliminated faster than the parent drug. Such PK models can provide quantitative estimates of relative in vivo metabolism rates for routes catalyzed by functionally polymorphic enzymes.", 
    "21": "Due to inherent dangers and barriers to research in emergency settings, few data are available to guide clinicians about how best to manage behavioral emergencies. Key constructs such as agitation are poorly defined. This lack of empirical data led us to undertake a survey of expert opinion, results of which were published in the 2001 Expert Consensus Guidelines on the Treatment of Behavioral Emergencies. Several second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are now available in new formulations for treating behavioral emergencies (e.g., intramuscular [i.m.] olanzapine and ziprasidone; rapidly dissolving tablets of olanzapine and risperidone). Critical questions face the field. The SGAs are significantly different from the FGAs and from each other and have not been studied in unselected patients as were the FGAs. Can the SGAs can be thought of as a class, do all antipsychotics have similar anti-agitation effects in different conditions, and, if equally effective, what limits might their safety profiles impose? Should antipsychotics be used more specifically to treat psychotic conditions, while benzodiazepines (BNZs) alone are used nonspecifically? Few data are available concerning combinations of SGAs and BNZs, and findings concerning the traditional combination of haloperidol plus a BNZ may not be relevant to combinations with SGAs. The culture is also evolving with more emphasis on patient involvement in treatment decisions. An international consensus has been developing that calming rather than sedation is the appropriate endpoint of behavioral emergency interventions. We undertook a new survey of expert opinion to update recommendations from the earlier survey.", 
    "22": "A written survey of 61 questions (1,020 options) was mailed to 50 experts in the field, 48 (96%) of whom completed it. The survey sought to define level of agitation at which emergency interventions are appropriate, scope of assessment depending on urgency and patients' ability to cooperate, guiding principles for selecting interventions, and appropriate physical and medication strategies at different levels of diagnostic confidence for a variety of provisional diagnoses and complicating conditions. A modified version of the RAND Corporation's 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions was used to score most options. Consensus was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by chi-square \"goodness-of-fit\" test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred, second line/alternate, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean. Ratings were used to develop guidelines for preferred strategies in key clinical situations. This study received financial support from multiple sponsors, with the panel kept blind to sponsorship to reduce possible bias. Medication ratings were based on responses of only those respondents with direct experience with each drug. In reporting practice patterns, the panel was asked to respond based on actual data rather than estimates.", 
    "23": "The expert panel reached consensus on 78% of the options rated on the 9-point scale. The responses suggest that physicians can make provisional diagnoses with some confidence and that pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are selected differentially based on diagnosis and other salient demographic and medical features. BNZs are recommended when no data are available, when there is no specific treatment (e.g., personality disorder), or when they may have specific benefits (e.g., intoxication). No single SGA emerges as a nonspecific replacement for haloperidol; instead, different SGAs are preferred in various circumstances consistent with current evidence. To the degree that haloperidol is recommended, it is almost always in combination with a BNZ; haloperidol alone is preferred only in the medically compromised. In contrast, the SGAs are more often recommended for use alone, and the panel would avoid combining BNZs with some SGAs. Oral risperidone alone or combined with a BNZ receives strong support in a variety of situations. Oral olanzapine was rated very similarly to risperidone, with slightly higher ratings than risperidone in situations where it has been studied (e.g., schizophrenia, mania) and slightly lower ratings where it has not been studied or safety may be a concern; there was less support for combining oral olanzapine with a BNZ. For oral treatment of agitation related to schizophrenia or mania, olanzapine alone, risperidone alone or combined with a BNZ, and haloperidol plus a BNZ are first line, with strong support also for combining divalproex with the antipsychotic for presumed mania. Oral ziprasidone and quetiapine generally received similar second-line ratings in most situations. If a parenteral agent is needed, i.m. olanzapine alone received somewhat more support than i.m. ziprasidone alone; however, there was more support for i.m. ziprasidone alone or combined with a BNZ than for i.m. olanzapine plus a BNZ, probably reflecting safety concerns. For example, for a provisional diagnosis of schizophrenia, first-line parenteral options are i.m. olanzapine or ziprasidone alone or i.m. haloperidol or ziprasidone combined with a BNZ. Neither of the new parenteral formulations received as much support as traditional agents (i.m. BNZs, i.m. haloperidol) when no data are available or the diagnosis involves medical comorbidity or intoxication. When initial intervention with risperidone, ziprasidone, or haloperidol is unsuccessful, the panel recommended adding a BZD to the antipsychotic. However, when initial treatment with olanzapine or quetiapine is unsuccessful, increasing the dosage is recommended. Perphenazine was consistently rated second line and droperidol and chlorpromazine received third-line ratings throughout.", 
    "24": "Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines suggest that the SGAs are now preferred for agitation in the setting of primary psychiatric illnesses but that BNZs are preferred in other situations.",

We found a high number of patients using alcohol, and a lower but still relavant number of benzodiazepine users in this large and unselected traumatology ER sample. This study adds evidence to the existing literature about the co-occurance of alcohol and/or benzodiazepine consumption and accident-related injuries.", 
    "39": "Up to now, the metabolism of hispidulin (5,7,4'-trihydroxy-6-methoxyflavone), a potent ligand of the central human benzodiazepine receptor, has not been investigated. To elucidate the metabolism of hispidulin in the large intestine, its biotransformation by the pig caecal microflora was studied. In addition, the efficiency of the pig caecal microflora to degrade galangin (3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone), kaempferol (3,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyflavone), apigenin (5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone), and luteolin (5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone) was investigated. Identification of the formed metabolites was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection, HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, and high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The caecal microflora transformed hispidulin to scutellarein (5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyflavone), an effective alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid; galangin to phenylacetic acid and phloroglucinol; kaempferol to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, phloroglucinol, and 4-methylphenol; apigenin to 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid and 3-phenylpropionic acid, and luteolin to 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid, respectively. To elucidate to what extent different hydroxylation patterns on the B-ring influence the degradation degree of flavonoids, the conversions of galangin and kaempferol as well as that of apigenin and luteolin were compared with those of quercetin (3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone) and chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone), respectively. Regardless of the flavonoid subclass, the presence of a hydroxy group at the 4'-position seems to be a prerequisite for fast breakdown. An additional hydroxy group at the B-ring did not affect the degradation degree.", 
    "40": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) drug impact on mental functions was explored in a cohort study of 30 psychiatric outpatients on long-term BDZ medication. A new questionnaire, the Drug Impact on Mental Processes (DIMP) was used and evaluated. The patients were rated three times: on inclusion in the study, after about 18 months and, finally, only a few days later. Test-retest reliability was evaluated for the two last ratings and was found acceptable for 19/23 items. The DIMP scores indicated negative effects on crisis reaction, intensified defence mechanisms and reduced cognitive, emotional and conative functions. Long-term BDZ treatment intensified passive coping. The drug impact on mental functions ranged between a mild and a moderate degree. The clinical outcomes of the patients' psychiatric disorders were evaluated at a 1-year follow-up after continued or discontinued BDZ treatment. In the subgroup that had discontinued the BDZ treatment at follow-up, significantly more patients reported reduced severity of their psychiatric disorders and significantly more patients had paid jobs. The overall clinical improvement after discontinued BDZ treatment may be explained by recovery from an addiction syndrome. It may also be related to a shift from passive to active coping.", 
    "41": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine can evoke psychotic symptoms in normal individuals and schizophrenic patients. Here, we have examined the effects of PCP (5 mg/kg) and ketamine (25 mg/kg) on the efflux of serotonin (5-HT) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and their possible blockade by the antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol, as well as ritanserin (5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist) and prazosin (alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist). The systemic administration, but not the local perfusion, of the two NMDA receptor antagonists markedly increased the efflux of 5-HT in the mPFC. The atypical antipsychotics clozapine (1 mg/kg) and olanzapine (1 mg/kg), and prazosin (0.3 mg/kg), but not the classical antipsychotic haloperidol (1 mg/kg), reversed the PCP- and ketamine-induced increase in 5-HT efflux. Ritanserin (5 mg/kg) was able to reverse only the effect of PCP. These findings indicate that an increased serotonergic transmission in the mPFC is a functional consequence of NMDA receptor hypofunction and this effect is blocked by atypical antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "42": "Authors examined the use of clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone by reviewing retrospectively their prescribing practice in the period of 1999-2003 in Hungary. The aim of the study was to analyze the utilization aspects of the use of the three novel antipsychotics. Data showed a fast growing trend in the use of olanzapine and risperidone while the use of clozapine is decreasing. The purpose of the present study was to follow the temporal development trends of use of the three examined novel antipsychotics which could result in a cost-effective drug therapy.", 
    "43": "The recently developed technique of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) has been applied to the rapid analysis of controlled substances. Experiments have been performed using a commercial ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage MAX ion-trap mass spectrometer with limited modifications. Results from the ambient sampling of licit and illicit tablets demonstrate the ability of the DESI technique to detect the main active ingredient(s) or controlled substance(s), even in the presence of other higher-concentration components. Full-scan mass spectrometry data provide preliminary identification by molecular weight determination, while rapid analysis using the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) mode provides fragmentation data which, when compared to the laboratory-generated ESI-MS/MS spectral library, provide structural information and final identification of the active ingredient(s). The consecutive analysis of tablets containing different active components indicates there is no cross-contamination or interference from tablet to tablet, demonstrating the reliability of the DESI technique for rapid sampling (one tablet/min or better). Active ingredients have been detected for tablets in which the active component represents less than 1% of the total tablet weight, demonstrating the sensitivity of the technique. The real-time sampling of cannabis plant material is also presented.", 
    "44": "An important percentage of schizophrenic patients does not respond or responds partially to treatment. The concept of schizophrenia resistance has changed over the years, moving from a dichotomous model into a continuous one. Although clozapine is the only antipsychotic with proved efficacy for these patients, beneficial effects have been observed with other drugs. Other antipsychotics, their combination, anticonvulsants, lithium, glycine site agonists, antidepressants and benzodiazepines are also used in the treatment of refractory patients with diverse results. In this article, evidence of the efficacy of these drugs and other types of treatment on schizophrenic- resistant patients is reviewed, and a psychopharmacological treatment strategy is proposed.", 
    "45": "Several studies have shown that olanzapine is effective in weight restoration and maintenance for patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). However, major depression is a very common comorbid psychiatric disorder associated with AN. Additional antidepressant therapy may be required for treating anorexic patients with major depression. The authors present a case of AN associated with major depression, who responded well to the combination treatment of olanzapine and mirtazapine. A 27-year-old Taiwanese woman was admitted because of severe weight loss, poor nutrition, amenorrhea, major depression, and starvation complications including hematological dyscrasis, electrolytes and endocrine imbalance, and sinus bradycardia. In additional to nutritional and medical treatments, the patient was given olanzapine 10 mg/day and mirtazapine 30 mg/day. She took the combined medications for six months. Meanwhile she received cognitive behavior therapy and family therapy. With these treatments, the patient's depression was in remission, her body weight was increased from 24 to 38 kg, and her body mass index was increased from 9.8 to 15.5. Our case suggests that the combined treatment of olanzapine and mirtazapine can be used in the treatment of AN associated with major depression.", 
    "46": "Repeated cycles of chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal result in sensitization of withdrawal-related CNS hyperexcitability that generally reflects an imbalance in activity of GABA and glutamate systems. Many pharmacological treatments for ethanol withdrawal target neuroadaptive changes in GABA and glutamate neurotransmission. The present study utilized a mouse model of repeated withdrawals to evaluate the ability of lorazepam and MK-801 treatments to antagonize behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of sensitized withdrawal seizure activity. Adult male C3H/He mice received chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure in inhalation chambers (16 h/day) and during each withdrawal cycle, separate groups of mice were evaluated for handling-induced convulsions (HIC) or abnormal EEG (high-voltage \"brief spindle episodes\" (BSE)) activity. Lorazepam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) or MK-801 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) treatment at 1 h into each of three withdrawal cycles reduced behavioral (HIC) and electrographic (BSE) signs of seizure activity in a dose-related fashion compared to vehicle-treated mice. During a subsequent untreated withdrawal, mice previously treated with lorazepam or MK-801 for earlier withdrawals exhibited reduced HIC activity during the acute phase but exacerbated HIC activity during the protracted phase of this final (fourth) withdrawal cycle. Both lorazepam and MK-801 treatment conditions resulted in enhanced BSE activity during the entire fourth (untreated) withdrawal episode. Collectively, these results suggest that while treatment of repeated ethanol withdrawals with a benzodiazepine (lorazepam) or an NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801) may have some initial benefits in ameliorating the development of sensitized withdrawal excitability, such treatment may also render subjects more vulnerable to seizure activity at later time points.", 
    "47": "Organization of semantic memory, one of the domains of cognitive function, is impaired in patients with schizophrenia, and is predictive of functional outcomes. The Category Fluency Task (CFT) has been used to evaluate organization of long-term semantic memory by means of visualizing semantic associations in the form of 'cognitive map' and cluster structures. While atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) have been shown to ameliorate overall cognitive deficits, little is known about the efficacy of AAPDs for improving higher cognitive functions, such as semantic memory organization. The purpose of the present study was to determine if treatment with olanzapine or ziprasidone has beneficial influence on organization of semantic memory, as revealed by analysis of data from the CFT, in patients with schizophrenia. A retrospective analysis of an open-label trial was conducted for 33 patients with schizophrenia who were treated with either olanzapine or ziprasidone. Nineteen subjects were unmedicated at baseline. The CFT and Letter Fluency Task, as well as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Quality of Life Scale (QLS), were administered at baseline and 6 wk of the treatment. Semantic structures were obtained by multidimensional scaling analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis of verbal outputs from the CFT. At baseline, no meaningful dimension or cluster was observed in the semantic structure; however, knowledge-based dimensions (wild vs. domestic) appeared after treatment with olanzapine or ziprasidone. Cluster structures also became organized, especially after treatment with olanzapine. Scores of QLS, but not those of BPRS, improved during treatment with the AAPDs. These results suggest a facilitative influence of AAPDs on higher cognitive functions, such as organization of semantic memory, in patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "48": "Precise, rhythmic, daily change of the internal milieu is a conspicuous feature of all living organisms. It affects temporal patterns of all kinds of behaviors during a day and deeply influences both the social structure and daily life of individual human beings. These daily variations arise from the internal circadian mechanisms. Three functions of the endogenous clock are discriminated as rhythm generation, entrainment to light-dark cycle and output from the clock. The endogenous clock is localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals. Recent papers demonstrated strong expression of clock genes such as Per1, Per2 and Per3 in the SCN. Circadian oscillation is basically regulated by the transcription/translation feedback system of the Per gene in mammals. As serotonin/antidepressant and GABA/benzodiazepine drugs affect the light and non-light-induced entrainment, these drugs can regulate the circadian oscillation of clock genes and environmental stimuli-induced change of Per gene expression in the SCN. There are two main stimuli that entrain circadian rhythm, the light-dark cycle (LD) and restricted feeding. Light resets the circadian clock with induction of Per1 and Per2 gene in the SCN, the locus of a main oscillator. Mice were allowed access to food for 4 h during daytime (7 h in advance of feeding time) under LD or constant darkness. The peaks of mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA in the cerebral cortex and liver were advanced 6-12 h after 6 days of RF, whereas those in SCN were unaffected. The increase of mPer expression by RF treatment was observed in SCN-lesioned mice. The present results suggest that RF strongly entrained the expression of mPer and clock-controlled genes in the cerebral cortex and liver without affecting light-dependent SCN clock function.",

    "53": "Overdose is a leading cause of death among illicit drug users. Nine hundred twenty-four injection drug users (IDUs) in Baltimore, Maryland, were interviewed to characterize overdose events and determine the circumstances under which they lead to drug treatment. Overall, 366 (39.7%) reported at least one non-fatal drug overdose. Most (96.2%) used heroin on the day of their last overdose and almost half (42.6%) used heroin and alcohol but few (4.1%) used tranquilizers or benzodiazepines. Five percent were in drug treatment when the overdose occurred and 7.1% had been incarcerated 2 weeks prior. One in four IDUs (26.2%) sought drug treatment within 30 days after their last overdose of whom 75% enrolled. Speaking with someone about drug treatment after the overdose was associated with treatment seeking (AOR 5.22; 95% CI: 3.12, 8.71). Family members were the most commonly cited source of treatment information (53.7%) but only those who spoke with spouses, crisis counselors and hospital staff were more likely to seek treatment. Not being ready for treatment (69.6%) and not viewing drug use as a problem (30.7%) were the most common reasons for not seeking treatment and being placed on a waiting list was the most common reason for not subsequently enrolling in treatment (66.7%). Of the IDUs treated by emergency medical technicians, ER staff or hospital staff, only 17.3%, 26.2% and 43.2% reported getting drug treatment information from those sources, respectively. Interventions that provide drug treatment information and enhance motivation for treatment in the medical setting and policies that reduce barriers to treatment entry among motivated drug users are recommended.", 
    "54": "Lactate is considered to play a significant role in energy metabolism and reflect neural activity in the brain. Using in vivo microdialysis technique, we measured extracellular lactate concentrations in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (BLA) of rats under electric footshock or psychological stress. We also attempted to determine whether the stress-induced changes of extracellular lactate concentrations in the BLA are attenuated by diazepam, an agonist at benzodiazepine receptors, and whether FG7142, an inverse agonist at benzodiazepine receptors, have a facilitative effect on energy metabolism in the BLA. Both footshock and psychological stress led to an increase in extracellular lactate concentrations in the BLA. Similar increment of extracellular lactate levels was observed by administration of FG7142. Pretreatment with diazepam attenuated the ability of FG7142, as well as physical or psychological burden, to increase lactate levels in the BLA. These results indicate that a variety of stressors enhances energy metabolism in the BLA, and suggest that some stress-induced changes in energy metabolism are regulated by benzodiazepine receptors.",

In order to assess whether GABARAP is required for GABA(A) receptor accumulation at synaptic sites, we analysed a GABARAP knockout mouse. GABARAP deficient mice are phenotypically normal and do not show up-regulation of other GABARAP homologues. Also, the total number of GABA(A)Rs, as assessed by benzodiazepine binding, is unaffected by the loss of GABARAP. Immunocytochemistry of cortical sections showed no differences in the expression and punctate distribution of the gamma2 subunit and the receptor anchoring protein gephyrin between GABARAP deficient and wild-type mice. Thus, GABARAP is not essential for trafficking gamma2 subunit containing GABA(A)Rs to the neuronal plasma membrane or targeting them to inhibitory synapses.",

The presence of at least one drug-drug interaction (DDI) and at least one drug-class duplication within each patient visit was also determined. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with receiving at least one inappropriate medication. These factors included age, gender, number of prescribed medications per visit, DDIs, duplications, and physician's number of years of experience. Similar analyses were performed to determine whether these factors were associated with a composite index (defined as having at least one of the following: receiving at least one inappropriate prescription, DDI, or duplication).",

    "78": "Delirium is a global impairment of upper brain functions caused by an organic substrate. It is frequently observed in the postoperative period, particularly in elderly people. Vascular and orthopedic surgery and long-duration surgery are associated with a higher incidence of postoperative delirium. When it occurs, postoperative delirium makes patient management much more difficult, increases costs, and, above all, causes severe discomfort to the patient. Delirium is also associated with higher postoperative mortality and morbidity, and with delayed functional recovery, but it is still unclear whether worse prognosis is directly caused by delirium or results from the neurological damage of which delirium is simply a symptom. Drug therapy should be part of a complex approach to prevent and treat this complication. Neuroleptics like haloperidol and droperidol, and benzodiazepines are usually employed in order to control symptoms like agitation, restlessness, and altered perceptions. Atypical neuroleptics, like risperidone, have not yet been studied in postoperative delirium, although some case reports in which they were successfully used have been published. Physiostigmine is effective in delirium caused by anticholinergic syndrome; vitamins may be useful in alcoholics; melatonin use has been suggested in order to prevent and treat delirium by normalizing sleep-wake cycle alterations. Environmental interventions are often costless and may be very useful to prevent and treat postoperative delirium in patients at risk.", 
    "79": "Many patients in the ICU receive mechanical ventilation and require sedative medications. Anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia can be considered the primary objects of sedative therapy. Intravenous benzodiazepines are the drugs most commonly used for sedation in ICU. Proper choice and use of benzodiazepines is based on knowledge of the pharmacology and is an essential component of caring for patients in the intensive care unit. Three benzodiazepines--Diazepam, Lorazepam and Midazolam--are currently available for parenteral use in the ICU. Onset and duration of action are determined by their lipid solubility. Respiratory depression and hypotension are dose-dependent. Midazolam is generally preferred to other benzodiazepines in most ICU. It has the shortest half-life of the benzodiazepines, does not have active metabolites, is water soluble and can be administered by continuous infusion. Despite the relatively short half-life of Midazolam, extensive distribution can cause prolonged sedation. Recovery time is proportional to the infusion's duration. Lorazepam is lipid soluble and dissolved in a propylene glycol carrier, produces a delayed onset and prolonged duration of effect and is preferred for long-term sedation (>48 hours). Propylene glycol toxicity is possible with high-dose or prolonged infusions. Diazepam has become less used with the introduction of the shorter-acting and less irritating benzodiazepine. The recent literature focuses on the differences between Midazolam and Propofol, the most used sedatives in ICU, their sequential use and combination. Relevant studies have been performed about propylene glycol toxicity.", 
    "80": "In critically ill patients, adequate sedation increases comfort, minimizes stress response and facilitates diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Propofol (2-, 6-diisopropylphenol) is an intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent popular for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit. The favorable propofol pharmacokinetic, characterized by a three compartment linear model, allows rapid onset and short duration of action. The emergence time from sedation with propofol varies with the depth and the duration of sedation and the patient's bodyweight. Propofol causes hypotension, particularly in volume depleted patients, decreases cerebral oxygen consumption, reduces intracranial pressure and has potent anti-convulsant properties. It is a potent antioxidant, has anti-inflammatory properties and is a bronchodilator. As a consequence of these properties, propofol is being increasingly used in the management of traumatic head injury, status epilepticus, delirium tremens, status asthmaticus and in septic patients. Prolonged use (>48 h) of high doses of propofol (>66 mcg/Kg/min) has been associated with lactic acidosis, bradycardia, and lipidemia in pediatric patients. A rare complication firstly reported in pediatrics patients and also observed in adults is known as \"propofol syndrome\" characterized by myocardial failure, metabolic acidosis and rhabdomiolysis. Hyperkalemia and renal failure have also been associated with this syndrome. Hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis are uncommon complications. A large number of trials have compared the use of propofol with midazolam. Sedation with propofol is associated with adequate sedation in ICU patients, shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation compared to midazolam, but not before ICU discharge.",

A statistically significant incidence of pneumonia was found in the patients with acute antidpressant poisoning (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed statistical significance for the following parameters: sex (p < 0.05), chronic alcohol intake (p < 0.05), underlying diseases (p < 0.01), central venous catheter (p < 0.05) vasopressors (p < 0.05), coma (p < 0.001), H2 blockers (p < 0.001) and corticosteroids (p < 0.001). The multivariate analysis retained endotracheal intubation and antidepressant drug poisoning as an independent risk factor for pneumonia.", 
    "84": "Using univariate and multivariate analysis, risk factors for developing pneumonia were disclosed. Some of these factors may be modified by simple medical procedures, thus the incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia in drug poisoning might be substantially reduced.",

Diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and dexamethasone have been used individually to treat CINV. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of those drugs administered via a patient controlled pump (BAD pump) to control CINV.", 
    "86": "A retrospective chart review was conducted of all pediatric oncology patients who received the BAD pump. Emetic episodes, doses of rescue medications to treat breakthrough nausea or vomiting, and occurrence of adverse events were recorded. Complete response (CR) was defined as no emesis or rescue medications, partial response (PR) as emesis but no rescue medications, and failure (F) as rescue medications required.",

Adverse events occurred in 4.2% of the courses; confusion (n = 2), depressed mood (n = 1), dysphoria (n = 1), agitation (n = 1), and restlessness (n = 1). All side effects resolved after decreasing the infusion rate, and the pump was not discontinued in any patients. Eighteen patients failed conventional prophylaxis and received BAD pump for identical subsequent chemotherapy cycles; they spent more days in CR with BAD pump than without it, 21 versus 45 days (P = .003) respectively. Patients receiving BAD pump had significantly shorter hospital stay with BAD pump than those not receiving it, 68 days versus 76 (P = .046).",

The routes of metabolism of this compound in vivo in rat have been well characterised, the identities of the major metabolites are confirmed by synthesis and their biological profiles were evaluated.

    "90": "The idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are a group of epilepsies that are genetically determined, have no structural or anatomic cause, and usually begin early in life. Neurologic examination, intelligence, and imaging studies are normal, and EEG shows only epileptiform abnormalities (i.e., no abnormal slow activity or evidence for diffuse encephalopathy). In some IGE, the genetic substrate has been identified, whereas in most, it remains unknown. Depending on the age at onset and predominant seizure type, individual subtypes of IGE (syndromes) are defined. However, overall, there are more similarities than there are differences among the various subtypes, and the IGE are best viewed as a spectrum or continuum of conditions. In general, IGE respond to treatment, with 80-90% becoming fully controlled. However, not all antiepileptic drugs (AED) are equally effective in IGE. Some AED are ill advised because they either do not work or exacerbate seizure types other than generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, that is, absence and myoclonic seizures. These include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, and tiagabine. Their use is the main cause of \"pseudo-intractability,\" and at least in the United States where PHT and CBZ are the most commonly used AEDs, patients with IGE are often on inadequate medications. For patients with clear IGE, the drug of choice is generally valproic acid because it effectively controls absence myoclonic seizures and GTC seizures. Second-line drugs (when first-line drugs fail or are not tolerated) may include benzodiazepines, but the use of second-line drugs is evolving rapidly. Some of the newer AEDs are considered broad spectrum, meaning that they work in IGE and focal epilepsies, although the evidence is largely preliminary at this point. These newer AEDs include lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and zonisamide.", 
    "91": "Being a woman with epilepsy is not the same as being a man with epilepsy. Epilepsy affects sexual development, menstrual cycle, aspects of contraception, fertility, and reproduction. MENSTRUAL CYCLE, EPILEPSY, AND FERTILITY: The diagnosis of epilepsy and the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) present women of childbearing age with many problems; both the disease and its treatment can alter the menstrual cycle and fertility. CONTRACEPTION IN EPILEPSY: There are no contraindications to the use of nonhormonal methods of contraception in women with epilepsy (see Table 3). Nonenzyme-inducing AEDs (valproate sodium, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, and levetiracetam) do not show any interactions with the combined oral contraceptive pill. There are interactions between the COCP and hepatic microsomal-inducing AEDs (phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, topiramate [doses above 200 mg/day], and oxcarbazepine) and also lamotrigine. SEXUALITY: The majority of women with epilepsy appear to have normal sex lives, although in some women with epilepsy, both the desire and arousal phases may be inhibited. PRECONCEPTION COUNSELING: Preconception counseling should be available to all women with epilepsy who are considering pregnancy. Women with epilepsy should be aware of a number of issues relating to future pregnancy, including methods and consequences of prenatal screening, genetics of their seizure disorder, teratogenicity of AEDs, folic acid and vitamin K supplements, labor, breast feeding, and childcare. PREGNANCY: The lowest effective dose of the most appropriate AED should be used, aiming for monotherapy where possible. Recent pregnancy databases have suggested that valproate is significantly more teratogenic than carbamazepine, and the combination of valproate sodium and lamotrigine is particularly teratogenic. Most pregnancies are uneventful in women with epilepsy, and most babies are delivered healthy with no increased risk of obstetric complications in women. BREAST FEEDING: All women with epilepsy should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies. The AED concentration profiled in breast milk follows the plasma concentration curve. The total amount of drug transferred to infants via breast milk is usually much smaller than the amount transferred via the placenta during pregnancy. However, as drug elimination mechanisms are not fully developed in early infancy, repeated administration of a drug such as lamotrigine via breast milk may lead to accumulation in the infant. THE CARE OF CHILDREN OF MOTHERS WITH EPILEPSY: Although there is much anxiety about the possible risks to a child from the mother's epilepsy, there is little published evidence. The risk of the child being harmed depends on the type of seizure and its severity and frequency, and this risk is probably small if time is taken to train mothers and caregivers in safety precautions. MENOPAUSE: During menopause, about 40% of women report worsening of their seizure disorder, 27% improve, and a third had no change. Hormone replacement therapy is significantly associated with an increase in seizure frequency during menopause, and this is more likely in women with a history of catamenial epilepsy. BONE HEALTH: Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of fractures, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia.", 
    "92": "The efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is dependent upon donor-acceptor proximity and spectral overlap, whether the acceptor partner is fluorescent or not. We report here on the design, synthesis, and characterization of two novel pirenzepine derivatives that were coupled to patent blue VF and pinacyanol dyes. These nonfluorescent compounds, when added to cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-fused muscarinic M1 receptors, promote EGFP fluorescence extinction in a time-, concentration-, and atropine-dependent manner. They display nanomolar affinity for the muscarinic receptor, determined using either FRET or classical radioligand binding conditions. We provide evidence that these compounds behave as potent acceptors of energy from excited EGFP with quenching efficiencies comparable to those of analogous fluorescent bodipy or rhodamine red pirenzepine derivatives. The advantages they offer over fluorescent ligands are illustrated and discussed in terms of reliability, sensitivity, and wider applicability of FRET-based receptor binding assays.", 
    "93": "It has been demonstrated that exposure to a variety of stressful experiences enhances fearful reactions when behavior is tested in current animal models of anxiety. Until now, no study has examined the neurochemical changes during the test and retest sessions of rats submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM). The present study uses a new approach (HPLC) by looking at the changes in dopamine and serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens in animals upon single or double exposure to the EPM (one-trial tolerance). The study involved two experiments: i) saline or midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) before the first trial, and ii) saline or midazolam before the second trial. For the biochemical analysis a control group injected with saline and not tested in the EPM was included. Stressful stimuli in the EPM were able to elicit one-trial tolerance to midazolam on re-exposure (61.01%). Significant decreases in serotonin contents occurred in the prefrontal cortex (38.74%), amygdala (78.96%), dorsal hippocampus (70.33%), and nucleus accumbens (73.58%) of the animals tested in the EPM (P < 0.05 in all cases in relation to controls not exposed to the EPM). A significant decrease in dopamine content was also observed in the amygdala (54.74%, P < 0.05). These changes were maintained across trials. There was no change in the turnover rates of these monoamines. We suggest that exposure to the EPM causes reduced monoaminergic neurotransmission activity in limbic structures, which appears to underlie the \"one-trial tolerance\" phenomenon.", 
    "94": "A 56-year-old married woman with late-onset Leonhard's confusion psychosis was treated successfully with acute electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) after failing to respond to antidepressants, neuroleptics, and benzodiazepines. Symptoms relapsed within 1 year despite the combined use of olanzapine and paroxetine. The patient responded to a second course of acute ECT, but a second relapse occurred within 3 months despite her use of olanzapine and paroxetine. The symptoms resolved with continuation ECT and lithium combined with paroxetine after response to a third course of acute ECT. To date, relapse has been prevented for 2 years. Continuation ECT and lithium combined with paroxetine after response to acute ECT may be effective in maintaining remission of Leonhard's confusion psychosis.",

    "96": "Families were ascertained through the MPS societies of Australasia, the UK, and the USA. Questionnaires were sent by mail and were answered anonymously. Identical questions regarding sleep disturbance were asked about unaffected siblings to provide control data. Sleep disturbance was quantified by a total sleep disturbance score.", 
    "97": "A total of 141 responses were received; 91.5% of children with Sanfilippo syndrome had sleep disturbance and this was significantly higher than for their unaffected sibs; 77.5% of parents had used medication for this problem, with melatonin and antihistamines being most commonly used. Melatonin and benzodiazepines were reported as the most efficacious. Many different environmental modifications had been employed for this problem and some parents reported success with behavioural therapies.", 
    "98": "Sleep disturbance is common, severe, and difficult to manage in Sanfilippo syndrome. Based on the parental responses and its safety profile, melatonin is the first line drug that should be tried. Behavioural therapy should be tried in all with Sanfilippo syndrome and sleep disturbance.", 
    "99": "In this paper, augmentation has been applied to data matrices, which originate from hyphenated methods that share the same mode of detection, but use different separation methods, HPLC-DAD and MEKC-DAD. A novel method, wavelength shift eigenstructure tracking (WET), has been proposed for the alignment between the wavelength scale of both detectors. WET proves to be suitable for the detection as well as correction of wavelength shift between both detectors. After correction of the wavelength scale, data obtained on both systems have been augmented and submitted to iterative target transformation factor analysis. Augmented curve resolution provides significantly better estimates of the chromatographic and electrophoretic profiles and spectra than the use of non-augmented curve resolution on HPLC and MEKC data separately. It is particularly useful when the pure fraction of a chromatographic peak is less than 0.10. Finally, the relative weight of MEKC versus HPLC in augmentation may be increased using intensity and noise normalisation. However, since noise normalisation and its accompanying decrease in signal-to-noise ratio leads to a loss of information, and, since intensity normalisation may cause a failure of the augmented curve resolution algorithm, benefits and drawbacks of normalisation should be weighed on a case-by-case basis.",

Rats solved the Morris swim task in 2 settings; 1 in which a hidden escape platform was always in the same location (performance) and a 2nd in which the platform had been moved to a different location (acquisition) for repeated daily sessions. CDP (3.0 mg/kg) administered alone did not disrupt escape latencies or swim path accuracies. SCP and DZP each impaired acquisition and performance in a dose-dependent manner. CDP coadministered with 0.3 mg/kg SCP impaired escape only in the acquisition setting and when coadministered with 1.0 mg/kg SCP selectively exacerbated the escape impairment in the acquisition setting. CDP ameliorated deleterious effects of DZP in both settings.", 
    "101": "There is only limited knowledge on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its active metabolites in potential organ donors.

    "103": "In each of the 4 patients studied, the elimination of midazolam and/or midazolam metabolites was delayed. As long as brain death diagnosis requires that drugs interfering with the clinical assessment must be at levels below the therapeutic range, monitoring of midazolam and metabolites appears mandatory.", 
    "104": "Sedation administration and agitation management are fundamental activities in any intensive care unit. A lack of objective measures of agitation and sedation, as well as poor understanding of the underlying dynamics, contribute to inefficient outcomes and expensive healthcare. Recent models of agitation-sedation pharmacodynamics have enhanced understanding of the underlying dynamics and enable development of advanced protocols for semi-automated sedation administration. However, these initial models do not capture all observed dynamics, particularly periods of low sedative infusion. A physiologically representative model that incorporates endogenous agitation reduction (EAR) dynamics is presented and validated using data from 37 critical care patients. High median relative average normalised density (RAND) values of 0.77 and 0.78 support and minimum RAND values of 0.51 and 0.55 for models without and with EAR dynamics respectively show that both models are valid representations of the fundamental agitation-sedation dynamics present in a broad spectrum of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. While the addition of the EAR dynamic increases the ability of the model to capture the observed dynamics of the agitation-sedation system, the improvement is relatively small and the sensitivity of the model to the EAR dynamic is low. Although this may represent a limitation of the model, the inclusion of EAR is shown to be important for accurately capturing periods of low, or no, sedative infusion, such as during weaning prior to extubation.", 
    "105": "This study demonstrates, for the first time, by both autoradiography and binding assay that [3H]Ro 15-1788 binds to carp brain with a high degree of anatomical selectivity. Saturation binding of the radioligand was determined in seven anatomically defined regions and suggested the presence of one class of binding sites (Type I-lke). In general, there was a good correlation between the autoradiographic and the binding data. By far, the optic tectum and the vagal, facial, and glossopharyngeal lobes showed the majority of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding sites. Low to negative concentration of binding sites was detected in the cerebellum. The location of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding sites in particular brain regions, indicates that benzodiazepine receptors could be associated with pathways involved in the control of basic central functions as spatial learning acquisition and retention, and feeding behaviour.", 
    "106": "We examined the reliability and construct validity of the 5-Item Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In addition, we assessed the performance of two 1-item screening questions to detect sexual dysfunction as defined by a cut-off scoring criteria of sexual dysfunction for the ASEX. One question was a general question about any side effects. The second question asked specifically about sexual dysfunction. Altogether 247 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder provided data at a single interview. Results indicated that the ASEX has good internal consistency and construct validity for the patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The point-biserial correlations and logistic regression found a high degree of agreement between the one-item specific screening question for sexual dysfunction and the ASEX. Overall, sensitivity (85%), specificity (63.7%), and positive (83%) and negative (67.1%) predictive values for the specific one-item screening question were satisfactory. The single general side effect question performed poorly (sensitivity=11.3%; specificity=92.5%; positive predictive value=76%; negative predictive value=33%). The current findings demonstrate the highly acceptable psychometric properties of the ASEX in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In addition, a specific one-item screening question is of clinical utility in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.", 
    "107": "The present experiment was designed to replicate and extend previous results of an opiate+benzodiazepine interaction in which peripherally administered alprazolam was observed to modulate behavior resulting from intravenous injections of heroin. As a first step in determining the role of central sites in this drug interaction, changes in drug reward (measured by conditioned place preference; CPP) were assessed in rats given systemic administration of alprazolam coupled with intracranially infused heroin (into the ventral tegmental area; VTA). Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with guide cannula targeting the VTA, after which a heroin-induced CPP dose-response curve was determined (2.5-40 ng administered bilaterally in 0.5 microl/side). In other animals, intra-VTA heroin-induced place preferences were challenged with systemically applied alprazolam (0.125 mg/kg i.p.). The data confirm that rats dose-dependently develop reliable place preferences for a distinct environment paired with bilateral VTA-infusions of heroin. Additionally, when a non-rewarding dose of alprazolam was combined with a non-rewarding bilateral intra-VTA heroin dose (5 ng), a significant CPP was produced. These data extend earlier results by demonstrating that a systemically applied benzodiazepine can enhance the rewarding effects produced by central opiate administration. The results suggest that the VTA might be a site where this opiate+benzodiazepine interaction occurs.",

Further exploration of the structural requirements for agonist activity has provided another class of potent, orally active, non-peptidic vasopressin V2 receptor selective agonists exemplified by the 5,11-dihydro-pyrido[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine as a candidate for further development.", 
    "109": "In epileptic patients, there is a high incidence of psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ionotropic receptor GABA(A)/benzodiazepine allosteric site is involved in both epilepsy and anxiety. This involvement is based on the fact that benzodiazepine allosteric site agonists are anticonvulsant and anxiolytic drugs; on the other hand, benzodiazepine inverse agonists are potent convulsant and anxiogenic drugs. The aim of this work was to determine if subgroups of rats selected according to their susceptibility to clonic convulsions induced by a convulsant dose 50% (CD50) of DMCM, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, would differ in behavioral tests commonly used to measure anxiety (elevated plus-maze, open field) and depression (forced swimming test). In the first experiment, subgroups of adult male Wistar rats were selected after a single dose of DMCM and in the second experiment they were selected after two injections of DMCM given after an interval of 1 week. Those rats presenting full clonic convulsions were termed Low Threshold rats to DMCM-induced clonic convulsions (LTR) and those not having clonic convulsions High Threshold rats to DMCM-induced clonic convulsions (HTR). In both experiments, only those rats presenting full clonic convulsions induced by DMCM and those not showing any signs of motor disturbances were used in the behavioral tests. The results showed that the LTR subgroup selected after two injections of a CD50 of DMCM spent a significantly lower time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze and in the off the walls area of the open field; moreover, this group also presented a higher number of rearings in the open field. There were no significant differences between HTR and LTR subgroups in the forced swimming test. LTR and HTR subgroups selected after only one injection of DMCM did not differ in the three behavioral tests. To verify if the behavioral differences between HTR and LTR subgroups of rats selected after two injections of DMCM were due to the clonic convulsion, another experiment was carried out in which subgroups of rats susceptible and nonsusceptible to clonic convulsions induced by a CD50 of picrotoxin, a GABA(A) receptor channel blocker, were selected and submitted to the elevated plus-maze and open field tests. The results obtained did not show any significant differences between these two subgroups in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests. In another approach to determine the relation between fear/anxiety and susceptibility to clonic convulsions, subgroups of rats were selected in the elevated plus-maze as more or less fearful/anxious. The CD50 for clonic convulsions induced by DMCM was determined for each of these two subgroups. The results showed a significantly lower CD50 for the more fearful/anxious subgroup, which means a higher susceptibility to clonic convulsions induced by DMCM. The present findings show a relation between susceptibility to clonic convulsions and fear/anxiety and vice versa which may be due to differences in the assembly of GABA(A)/allosteric benzodiazepine site receptors in regions of the brain.",

LPS increased DAG content, and promoted PKC activity and PKCzeta translocation (P< 0.01). CCK-8 decreased LPS-induced DAG content and inhibited LPS-induced PKC activity and PKCzeta translocation significantly at 1 x 10(-8) - 1 x 10(-5) mol/L (P< 0.01).

    "114": "We evaluated the diagnostic performance of Triage for benzodiazepines in 74 urine specimens from outpatients given therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and compared the results of EMIT assays. Results obtained in all urine samples were confirmed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Overall agreement between results of Triage and EMIT assays was 73%. All of the Triage-positive samples were also positive by EMIT assays. Results of Triage and EMIT assays were different for 20 samples obtained from patients given thienodiazepines (etizolam, brotizolam, and clotiazepam) and nitrobenzodiazepines (nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam). LC-MS confirmed parent drugs in urine specimens, consistent with the prescriptions of drugs. The low agreement between Triage and EMIT results in this study might be due to low sensitivity of Triage for thienodiazepines. Thienodiazines are frequently prescribed benzodiazepines, and Triage panel is the most frequently used screening kit in Japan. It should be noted that negative results obtained by a Triage test might not mean the absence of thienodiazepines.",

These findings showed that the benzodiazepines and their derivatives have teratogenic effect in the developing mammalian central nervous system.",

There was a significant difference in the percentage of D2 occupancy for smokers (mean 74.3%, SD 12.8, n=31) and nonsmokers (mean 49.8%, SD 9.1, n=5).",

    "132": "There is a mesencephalic dopaminergic network outside the ventral tegmental area (VTA), including structures such as the rostral linear nucleus (RLi) and periaqueductal gray (PAG). These nuclei project to neural areas implicated in reinforcing effects of drugs, indicating that they could participate in opiate reward. The objectives were to study the morphological characteristics of the dopamine network of the RLi/PAG region, and to discern its role on rewarding and sensitizing effects of heroin in rats, following dopamine depletion or local injection of dopaminergic antagonists. The findings indicated that this network is composed of small cells in the RLi/ventral PAG, large multipolar dopamine PAG neurons, and periaqueductal PAG neurons. Following repeated heroin, large PAG neurons and small RLi/ventral PAG cells (not periaqueductal neurons) were activated, since tyrosine-hydroxylase was adaptively induced, without changes in protein kinase Aalpha. After dopamine depletion, small RLi/ventral PAG neurons and large cells of the PAG (not periaqueductal ones) were selectively affected by the neurotoxin. Dopamine neurons of the nearby VTA and dorsal raphe were not affected, as revealed by cell counting. After lesion, 'anxiety-like' responses and basal locomotion were not altered. However, conditioned place preference to heroin was found to be abolished, as well as heroin-induced motor sensitization. Following infusions of dopaminergic antagonists into RLi/PAG, D(2) (not D(1)) receptor blocking dose-dependently abolished heroin-induced reward. The present study provides evidence that dopamine neurons of the RLi/PAG region (excluding PAG periaqueductal cells) show adaptive biochemical changes after heroin, and mediate the rewarding and sensitizing effects of this drug. D(2) dopamine receptors within the RLi/PAG region participate in these effects.", 
    "133": "We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to compare the in vivo effects of olanzapine on prefrontal N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in treatment remitters and nonremitters. Secondary aims of this study were to identify neurochemical predictors of successful olanzapine treatment and other neurochemical effects of olanzapine. In all, 20 adolescents admitted for their first hospitalization for bipolar disorder, type I, manic or mixed and 10 demographically matched healthy subjects were recruited. Manic adolescents were treated with olanzapine monotherapy and scanned at three time points (N = 19). Medial and left and right lateral ventral prefrontal NAA, choline, creatine/phosphocreatine, myo-inositol, and glutamate/glutamine were measured at baseline, prior to receiving medication, and on days 7 and 28 of treatment. Healthy subjects did not receive medication but underwent 1H MRS scans at the same time points to assess for normal variability in metabolites over time. Although there was no overall increase in NAA in manic adolescents following 28 days of treatment with olanzapine, olanzapine remitters (N = 11, 58%) exhibited a greater increase in medial ventral prefrontal NAA compared with nonremitters (N = 8, 42%, p = 0.006). Specifically, from baseline to end point, NAA levels decreased in nonremitters (p = 0.03) and increased in remitters (p = 0.05). Manic adolescents treated with olanzapine had an increase from baseline to day 7 in medial (p = 0.002) and right lateral (p = 0.02) ventral prefrontal choline. Baseline medial ventral prefrontal choline was greater in olanzapine remitters than in nonremitters (p = 0.001). Successful treatment of mania with olanzapine may lead to increased ventral prefrontal neuronal viability and/or function as compared to unsuccessful treatment with olanzapine. Additionally, olanzapine-induced increases in choline may lead to alteration of abnormalities in cell membrane metabolism or second messenger pathways that are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.", 
    "134": "The GABA(A) receptor subtypes responsible for the anxiolytic effects of nonselective benzodiazepines (BZs) such as chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and diazepam remain controversial. Hence, molecular genetic data suggest that alpha2-rather than alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors are responsible for the anxiolytic effects of diazepam, whereas the anxiogenic effects of an alpha3-selective inverse agonist suggest that an agonist selective for this subtype should be anxiolytic. We have extended this latter pharmacological approach to identify a compound, 4,2'-difluoro-5'-[8-fluoro-7-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)imidazo[1,2-\u00e1]pyridin-3-yl]biphenyl-2-carbonitrile (TP003), that is an alpha3 subtype selective agonist that produced a robust anxiolytic-like effect in both rodent and non-human primate behavioral models of anxiety. Moreover, in mice containing a point mutation that renders alpha2-containing receptors BZ insensitive (alpha2H101R mice), TP003 as well as the nonselective agonist CDP retained efficacy in a stress-induced hyperthermia model. Together, these data show that potentiation of alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors is sufficient to produce the anxiolytic effects of BZs and that alpha2 potentiation may not be necessary.", 
    "135": "The effects of a common oral contraceptive preparation on the activity of 7 drug-metabolizing enzymes were investigated using the validated Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail. In a randomized crossover fashion, 10 premenopausal women received caffeine, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, intravenous midazolam, and warfarin + vitamin K with and without a triphasic oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 35 microg) and varying doses of daily norgestimate (0.18, 0.215, and 0.25 mg). Bioequivalence testing showed nonequivalence in drug versus no-drug treatment on the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (as reflected by metabolite ratios following probe drug administration); the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and NAT-2 decreased following the oral contraceptive, whereas the activity of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 increased. No effects on xanthine oxidase or hepatic CYP3A were seen. Application of a non-parametric statistical testing approach revealed a significant difference only for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. This triphasic oral contraceptive may have a clinically significant effect on the activity of some drug-metabolizing enzymes.", 
    "136": "The design, synthesis and evaluation of four novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) prodrugs (1a,b and 2a,b; ) for potential use in carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2)-based antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) is reported. Although all four prodrugs were shown to be less cytotoxic than the released parent PBDs 3 and 4, the urea prodrugs 1b and 2b were found to be too unstable for use in ADEPT, whereas carbamates 1a and 2a are both stable in an aqueous environment and are good substrates for CPG2.", 
    "137": "Multilamellar liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine and incorporating prednisolone (PZ), diazepam (DZ), or griseofulvin (GF) were prepared and characterized. Liposome size, surface charge, and stability (in buffer and serum proteins) were measured for drug-incorporating liposomes and empty liposomes for comparison. The results reveal that for all drugs studied drug incorporation has a substantial effect on the vesicle zeta-potential and stability. Drug-incorporating liposomes have a negative surface charge, while their membrane integrity is significantly higher when compared with that of empty liposomes. Release of DZ from liposomes is induced by dilution. Summarizing, the results of this study demonstrate that the presence of PZ, DZ, or GF in liposome membranes has a significant effect on main vesicle properties and correlates well with those obtained previously for hydrochlorothiazide and chlorothiazide. Thereby, we may conclude that the previously demonstrated effects of the thiazides on liposome properties are not solely related to their structure.", 
    "138": "The involvement of NMDA glutamate receptors in the effects of glucose/oxygen deprivation (in vitro ischaemia) on spontaneous endogenous acetylcholine and glutamate overflow from the guinea pig ileum was studied. Neurotransmitter overflow was measured by HPLC. Deprivation of glucose in the medium slightly reduced acetylcholine overflow, and did not significantly influence glutamate overflow. During oxygen deprivation and glucose/oxygen deprivation, acetylcholine overflow augmented with a biphasic modality: an early peak was followed by a long lasting increase, whereas glutamate overflow increased with a rapid and sustained modality. The effects of glucose/oxygen deprivation on both acetylcholine and glutamate overflow were abolished after reperfusion with normal oxygenated medium. Acetylcholine and glutamate overflow induced by glucose/oxygen deprivation were significantly reduced in the absence of external Ca(2+) as well as by the addition of the mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger blocker, CGP 37157, and of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)/ATPase blocker, thapsigargin. +/-AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist, and 5,7-diCl-kynurenic acid, an antagonist of the glycine site associated to NMDA receptor, markedly depressed glucose/oxygen deprivation-induced acetylcholine and glutamate overflow as well. Our results suggest that in vitro simulated ischaemia evokes acetylcholine and glutamate overflow from the guinea pig ileum, which is partly linked to an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration dependent on both Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular space and Ca(2+) mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stores. During glucose/oxygen deprivation, ionotropic glutamate receptors of the NMDA type exert both a positive feedback modulation of glutamate output and contribute to increased acetylcholine overflow.", 
    "139": "The present study from 2002 includes medicolegally examined fatal poisonings among drug addicts in the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. A common definition \"drug addict\" is applied by the participating countries. The number of deaths, age, sex, place of death, main intoxicant and other drugs present in the blood are recorded in order to obtain national data, as well as comparable Nordic data and data comparable to earlier studies from 1997 and 1991. The Icelandic results are commented on separately due to the low number of cases. The most fatal overdoses are seen in Norway, in both the death rate (number per 100,000 inhabitants=8.44) and in absolute number (n=232). The comparable figures for the other four countries are Denmark 5.43 (n=175), Iceland 3.6 (n=6), Finland 2.93 (n=94) and Sweden 2.56 (n=136). In earlier studies from 1991 and 1997, the highest death rate is seen in Denmark, with Norway as number two. Denmark is the only country where the death rate decreases from 1997 to 2002. A relatively large increase in deaths in the younger age groups (<30 years) is noted from 1997 to 2002, except in Denmark, where only a small increase in overdose deaths in very young people (15-19 years) is observed. Females account for 12-20% of the overdoses (three out of six deaths in Iceland). Relatively fewer deaths are recorded in the capital areas in 2002 than in 1997 and 1991, suggesting more geographically widespread drug use in the Nordic countries. Heroin/morphine is the single most frequently encountered main intoxicant, varying from 10% of the cases in Finland to 72% of the cases in Norway. Finland differs from the other countries in that a high percentage of the fatal overdoses in Finland are not caused by an illicit drug; buprenorphine overdoses are seen, and relatively few deaths resulting from heroin are seen. Methadone is the main intoxicant in 41% of the Danish overdose cases, 15% of the Norwegian cases, 4% of the Swedish cases and none of the Finnish overdose cases, an observation probably linked to different national prescription rules for methadone. The analytical screening reveals extended polydrug use. Frequently seen substances, in addition to the main intoxicant are amphetamine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), benzodiazepines and ethanol.", 
    "140": "NGFI-B, an orphan member of the NR4A subfamily of the nuclear receptors, recognizes specific sequences in the promoters of neuronal target genes as a monomer. Although NGFI-B also forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), a receptor for 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA), endogenous targets of the heterodimer have not been identified. We investigated the role of RXR ligand binding in NGFI-B/RXR activation and found that dibenzodiazepine-derived ligands, such as the weak RXR agonist HX600, selectively activate NGFI-B/RXR heterodimers. HX600 also activated the heterodimer formed by RXR and Nurr1, another NR4A subfamily receptor. In an assembly assay that detects ligand-dependent reconstruction of the ligand-binding domain, HX600 and not 9CRA induced an allosteric ligand effect on NGFI-B through RXRalpha binding. The data indicate that the RXR heterodimers of NGFI-B and Nurr1 are selectively activated by the RXR ligand HX600, and that compounds such as HX600 will be valuable tools in investigating NGFI-B and Nurr1 function.", 
    "141": "This study aimed to evaluate the possible potentiating action of ionotropic or metabotropic (metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5) glutamate agonists on pharmacological effects induced in rats by the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. The administration of doses of olanzapine, which did not affect spontaneous motility, inhibited behaviors induced by the selective stimulation of 5HT(2A) and D(2) receptors. In particular, 0.03 or 0.06 mg/kg of olanzapine was sufficient to reduce, respectively, head shakes induced by the 5HT(2A) agonist 1-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane (1 mg/kg) or hypermotility elicited by the D(2) stimulant quinpirole (0.15 mg/kg). Behavioral responses to a D(1)/D(2) agonist (apomorphine-induced stereotypies) were inhibited by doses of olanzapine that also influenced spontaneous behavior. The concomitant administration of D-cycloserine, an agonist at the glycine site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex, given at a dose (3 mg/kg) that did not affect behavior, increased the inhibitory effect of olanzapine on the responses produced by 5HT2A, D(2) and D(1)/D(2) receptor stimulation. The concomitant administration of 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine, an agonist of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5, increased the inhibitory effect of olanzapine on the behaviors induced by the stimulation of D(2), but not 5HT2A or D(1)/D(2) receptors. As the effect on the serotonergic system seems important for the unusual pharmacological profile of atypical antipsychotics, the present results suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate, but not metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 agonists could be seen as promising therapeutic agents for increasing the pharmacological effects of olanzapine.", 
    "142": "The ability to visualize the immune response with radioligands targeted to immune cells will enhance our understanding of cellular responses in inflammatory diseases. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are present in monocytes and neutrophils as well as in lung tissue. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a model of inflammation to assess whether the PBR could be used as a noninvasive marker of inflammation in the lungs. Planar imaging of mice administrated 10 or 30 mg/kg LPS showed increased [(123)I]-(R)-PK11195 radioactivity in the thorax 2 days after LPS treatment relative to control. Following imaging, lungs from control and LPS-treated mice were harvested for ex vivo gamma counting and showed significantly increased radioactivity above control levels. The specificity of the PBR response was determined using a blocking dose of nonradioactive PK11195 given 30 min prior to radiotracer injection. Static planar images of the thorax of nonradioactive PK11195 pretreated animals showed a significantly lower level of radiotracer accumulation in control and in LPS-treated animals (p < .05). These data show that LPS induces specific increases in PBR ligand binding in the lungs. We also used in vivo small-animal PET studies to demonstrate increased [(11)C]-(R)-PK11195 accumulation in the lungs of LPS-treated mice. This study suggests that measuring PBR expression using in vivo imaging techniques may be a useful biomarker to image lung inflammation.", 
    "143": "Recovery of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) is a key determinant of postischemic functional recovery of the heart. Mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release causes the collapse of DeltaPsi(m) and the destabilization of the action potential (AP) through a mechanism involving a mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) modulated by the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR). Here, we test the hypothesis that this mechanism contributes to spatiotemporal heterogeneity of DeltaPsi(m) during ischemia-reperfusion (IR), thereby promoting abnormal electrical activation and arrhythmias in the whole heart. High-resolution optical AP mapping was performed in perfused guinea pig hearts subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia followed by reperfusion. Typical electrophysiological responses, including progressive AP shortening followed by membrane inexcitablity in ischemia and ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion, were observed in control hearts. These responses were reduced or eliminated by treatment with the mBzR antagonist 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-Cl-DZP), which blocks depolarization of DeltaPsi(m). When applied throughout the IR protocol, 4'-Cl-DZP blunted AP shortening and prevented reperfusion arrhythmias. Inhibition of ventricular fibrillation was also achieved by bolus infusion of 4'-Cl-DZP just before reperfusion. Conversely, treatment with an agonist of the mBzR that promotes DeltaPsi(m) depolarization exacerbated IR-induced electrophysiological changes and failed to prevent arrhythmias. The effects of these compounds were consistent with their actions on IMAC and DeltaPsi(m). These findings directly link instability of DeltaPsi(m) to the heterogeneous electrophysiological substrate of the postischemic heart and highlight the mitochondrial membrane as a new therapeutic target for arrhythmia prevention in ischemic heart disease.", 
    "144": "Overactivity of the dopaminergic system in the brain is considered to be a contributing factor to the development and symptomatology of schizophrenia. Therefore, the GABAergic control of dopamine functions was assessed by disrupting the gene encoding the alpha3 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. alpha3 knockout (alpha3KO) mice exhibited neither an obvious developmental defect nor apparent morphological brain abnormalities, and there was no evidence for compensatory up-regulation of other major GABA(A)-receptor subunits. Anxiety-related behavior in the elevated-plus-maze test was undisturbed, and the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam, which is mediated by alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors, was preserved. As a result of the loss of alpha3 GABA(A) receptors, the GABA-induced whole-cell current recorded from midbrain dopamine neurons was significantly reduced. Spontaneous locomotor activity was slightly elevated in alpha3KO mice. Most notably, prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex was markedly attenuated in the alpha3KO mice, pointing to a deficit in sensorimotor information processing. This deficit was completely normalized by treatment with the antipsychotic D2-receptor antagonist haloperidol. The amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was not altered in alpha3KO mice compared with WT mice. These results suggest that the absence of alpha3-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors induces a hyperdopaminergic phenotype, including a severe deficit in sensorimotor gating, a common feature among psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Hence, agonists acting at alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors may constitute an avenue for an effective treatment of sensorimotor-gating deficits in various psychiatric conditions.", 
    "145": "Since specific benzodiazepine (Bz) binding sites have been found in the vision and oculomotor control areas of the central nervous system (CNS), the fast phases of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) should be affected by Bz administration. In this study, we examine the effects of Bzs on OKN fast phases under closed- and open-loop experimental conditions. Six normal subjects participated in the experiments. The eye movements were measured by the magnetic field, search coil technique, 90 min after diazepam or placebo administration. The study was performed in a randomized, double-blind fashion. After diazepam, the mean amplitude (MAmp) and mean peak velocity (MVel) of OKN fast phases decreased significantly under both experimental conditions. The percentage decreases in MAmp and MVel under the open-loop condition were significantly larger than those under the closed-loop condition. The results indicate that the fast phases of OKN could sensitively reflect the pharmacodynamic effects of Bzs on the CNS.",

Other important findings were a significant reduction in the use of benzodiazepines and opioids and a significant increase in the use of propofol in relation to all ventilator modes. The administration routes of sedative agents remained unchanged.",

    "151": "To characterize long-term prescriptions for commonly prescribed anxiolytic benzodiazepines to veteran patients and to identify factors associated with high daily doses, we analyzed the linked pharmacy and administrative databases from New England Veterans Healthcare System (VISN 1). We analyzed treatment episodes of 3 months or longer with the 4 most commonly prescribed agents: alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, and lorazepam. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate analyses described the sample and tested associations of pharmacological and clinical variables for patients prescribed the top 5% of average daily doses (\"high-dose\" prescriptions). From 16,630 full or partial treatment episodes for all 4 agents analyzed within a 42-month window, average daily doses were predominantly moderate, age-sensitive, and stable; refill lag intervals were short. Patients on \"high-dose\" prescriptions for the 4 agents combined, compared with \"middle quartile\" dose prescriptions, in adjusted analyses, were younger, more likely to have posttraumatic stress disorder (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.17-3.13), substance abuse (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.25-1.80), and anxiety (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.11-1.60) and were more likely to be receiving concurrent oxycodone/acetaminophen (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.64-2.56), anxiolytic benzodiazepine (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.12-2.03), antidepressant (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.80-2.58), and neuroleptic (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.69-2.44) prescriptions. These results indicate that veteran patients prescribed anxiolytic benzodiazepines typically receive modest, nonincreasing doses over long-term treatment episodes. However, those on the highest average daily doses, typically more than recommended guidelines, are more likely to have clinical diagnoses and concurrent prescriptions for psychoactive medications indicative of more complex and, perhaps, problematic management.", 
    "152": "Age and sex may influence both efficacy and side effects of second-generation antipsychotics. Women and elderly patients tend to have a higher prevalence for several side effects. Higher plasma levels in these groups of patients may be one reason. We studied the hypothesis that steady-state olanzapine plasma concentrations depend on age and sex. Sixty-seven inpatients on stable olanzapine dose were referred to routine therapeutic drug monitoring of olanzapine. Plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Obtained data were then analyzed by analysis of covariance. Olanzapine plasma levels showed a marked sex difference with significantly higher mean concentrations in female patients (adjusted mean concentrations, 18.5 ng/mL for men and 31.7 ng/mL for women; P = 0.003). On average, the weight-corrected concentration/dose ratios shown by women were 33.5% higher than those shown by men, irrespective of age. Regarding the effect of age, weight-corrected concentration/dose ratios increased by an average of 9.4% per decade of life. All results were adjusted for smoking. Comedication did not significantly influence these results. In conclusion, age and sex are important variables to consider when prescribing olanzapine for women and in the elderly.", 
    "153": "The tonic form of GABA-mediated inhibition requires the presence of slowly desensitizing GABA(A) receptors with high affinity, which has not yet been directly demonstrated in hippocampal neurons. Low concentration of GABA (1 microM) persistently increased baseline noise, increased membrane slope conductance, but did not affect spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in dentate granule cells (DGCs). Higher concentrations of GABA (10-100 microM) desensitized synaptic currents quickly, and there was a large residual current. Saturating concentration of GABA (1 mM) completely desensitized synaptic currents and revealed a slowly desensitizing, persistent current. Penicillin (300 microM) inhibited baseline noise without affecting mean current and inhibited decay time of sIPSCs. GABA(A) receptors mediating baseline noise in DGCs were sensitive to allopregnanolone, furosemide, and loreclezole and insensitive to diazepam and zolpidem. These studies demonstrate persistently open GABA(A) receptors on DGCs with high affinity for GABA, slow desensitization rate, and pharmacological properties similar to those of recombinant receptors containing alpha(4), beta(1), and the delta subunits.",
