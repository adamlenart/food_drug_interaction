    "0": "delta-Opioid receptor agonists have antidepressant-like effects in behavioral models of depression. Chronic administration of classical antidepressants upregulates mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkB in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. Increases in BDNF and TrkB levels are thought to be important for the therapeutic effects of these drugs. Therefore, we examined the ability of the delta-opioid receptor agonist (+)BW373U86 to regulate BDNF and TrkB mRNA expression in frontal cortex, hippocampus, as well as, basolateral amygdala, endopiriform nucleus, and primary olfactory cortex. At 3 h after a single administration of (+)BW373U86 animals were killed and BDNF and TrkB mRNA levels were examined by in situ hybridization. BDNF mRNA levels produced by (+)BW373U86 were compared to acute administration of the antidepressants desipramine and bupropion. A behaviorally antidepressant dose of 10 mg/kg (+)BW373U86 increased BDNF mRNA expression in all regions examined; a smaller dose of (+)BW373U86 (1 mg/kg) significantly increased BDNF mRNA expression only in frontal cortex. The delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole blocked (+)BW373U86-mediated increases in BDNF mRNA expression. In addition, tolerance developed to increased BDNF mRNA expression with repeated injection, except in frontal cortex. Midazolam was administered to some animals to prevent the convulsions produced by (+)BW373U86, but midazolam did not block delta-opioid receptor-mediated increases in BDNF mRNA expression in frontal cortex, hippocampus, or amygdala. Unlike desipramine and bupropion, (+)BW373U86 upregulated BDNF mRNA expression acutely (within 3 h after a single administration). These data support the concept that delta-opioid receptor agonists may have antidepressant potential, and could be good targets for the development of faster-acting antidepressants.", 
    "1": "Despite the availability of numerous treatment options, the diagnosis and treatment of myoclonic seizures continue to be challenging. Based on clinical experience, valproate and benzodiazepines have historically been used to treat myoclonic seizures. However, many more treatment options exist today, and the clinician must match the appropriate treatment with the patient's epilepsy syndrome and its underlying etiology. Comorbidities and other medications must also be considered when making decisions regarding treatment. Rarely, some antiepileptic drugs may exacerbate myoclonic seizures. Most epileptic myoclonus can be treated pharmacologically, but some cases respond better to surgery, the ketogenic diet, or vagus nerve stimulation. Because myoclonic seizures can be difficult to treat, clinicians should be flexible in their approach and tailor therapy to each patient.", 
    "2": "Both ethanol and diazepam are classified as depressants of the central nervous system and exert their effects via the GABAA receptor complex. We report the coexistence and concentrations of ethanol, diazepam, and its primary metabolite nordiazepam in a case series of 234 forensic autopsies collected over a ten-year period. Diazepam, nordiazepam, and ethanol were determined in femoral venous blood by highly selective gas chromatographic methods. The mean (median) femoral blood concentrations were ethanol 0.24 g/100 mL (0.25 g/100 mL), diazepam (D) 0.23 microg/g (0.10 microg/g), nordiazepam (ND) 0.24 micro/g (0.20 microg/g), sum (D + ND) 0.43 microg/g (0.30 microg/g), and the ratio D/ND was 1.19 (1.0). When cause of death was attributed to alcohol and/or drug intoxication (N = 50), the mean and median blood-ethanol concentration was higher, being 0.36 g/100 mL and 0.38 g/100 mL, respectively, whereas the mean (median) and range of blood-diazepam concentrations were about the same, 0.23 microg/g (0.10 microg/g) and 0.05 to 1.2 microg/g. The femoral-blood concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam were highly correlated (r = 0.73), but there was no correlation between the concentrations of ethanol and diazepam (r = -0.15). In another 114 fatalities (all causes of death) with diazepam and/or nordiazepam as the only drugs present, the mean (median) and range of blood-diazepam concentrations were 0.22 microg/g (0.10 microg/g) and 0.03 to 3.5 microg/g. The pathologists report showed that none of these deaths were classed as drug intoxications. The impression gleaned from this study of ethanol-diazepam deaths is that high blood-ethanol concentration is the major causative factor. We found no evidence that concurrent use of diazepam enhanced the acute toxicity of ethanol, although interpretation is complicated by the high blood-ethanol concentration (median 0.38 g/100 mL), making it difficult to discern an added effect of diazepam.", 
    "3": "This study aimed to compare the clinical and social benefits associated with Optimal Case Management (OCM) treatment that employ cognitive-behavioural strategies to those associated with Routine Case Management (RCM) that is widely used in community health services. Hundred patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to OCM and RCM treatment conditions. Patients in the OCM condition showed significantly more improvement on all measures compared to patients in RCM condition. Improvement on clinical symptoms and social functioning achieved by OCM tended to show a regular and continuous pattern throughout the course of the study. The results of this study suggest that every optimal treatment should aim improvement in social functioning and therefore quality of life of the patients.",

Initial sedation scheme was the association of midazolam and fentanyl. As from the 4th day, patient presented with several psychomotor agitation episodes, even after the association of lorazepam in the 6th day. In the 9th day, patient received the largest doses but remained agitated. Dexmedetomidine was associated, which has decreased other drug doses in 35% and has improved agitation. In the 12th day, midazolam and dexmedetomidine were replaced by propofol infusion with worsening of agitation. In the 13th day, clonidine was associated to the sedation scheme with total resolution of agitation. Propofol was withdrawn in the 14th day, fentanyl was maintained and midazolam infusion was restarted, with doses 75% and 65% lower as compared to peak doses of such drugs.

In addition, 100 sparse binary human data sets were generated from an evaluation of midazolam for postoperative sedation of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery by random selection of a single data point (sedation score vs. midazolam plasma concentration) from each of the 30 patients in the study. C50 and gamma were estimated for each of these data sets by using NONMEM and were compared with the estimates from the complete data set of 656 observations.",

    "16": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. The present study has examined the potential use of target concentration monitoring of olanzapine in plasma as a marker of clinical response and an aid in patient management. Fifty-three patients (mean age 32 years; 40 M, 13 F) with a DSM-IVR diagnosis of schizophrenia completed a 6-week trial of oral olanzapine. Participants received once-daily olanzapine, and their psychotic symptoms were measured with the PANSS (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale) on admission and again after 6 weeks. Responders were classified as having a >/=20% decrease in PANSS scores. Plasma olanzapine was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify a break point in plasma olanzapine that might serve as a surrogate for PANSS classification, and the two methods were compared using the McNemar chi2 test. After 6 weeks the median olanzapine dose was 15 mg/d (range 5-30 mg/d), and the mean plasma olanzapine was 32 micrograms/L at a mean of 13.5 hours after dose. With the PANSS (total), there were 42 responders and 11 nonresponders. ROC curve analysis for total PANSS identified a break point at 23 micrograms/L plasma olanzapine, with the proportions of responders and nonresponders identified by PANSS and the plasma break point being similar. Similar break points were found for the positive, negative, and global PANSS subscores. Nevertheless, these relationships were very modest, and at best the target plasma olanzapine concentration identified only 20% more responders than nonresponders. We suggest that plasma olanzapine monitoring can be used for dose-response optimization, but only to complement the normal clinical evaluation process.",

The mean time to achieve adequate sedation was 3.6 min (SD 1.2) for the propofol group in comparison to 7.3 min (SD 2.8) for the meperidine/midazolam group (p<0.05). Procedure times between the groups were similar: propofol, 3.9 min (SD 1.9); midazolam/meperidine, 2.7 min (SD 0.8) (p=0.11). The level of sedation achieved by the propofol group was greater (p=0.0001). Time to full recovery was faster in the propofol group: 34.9 min (SD 10.3) versus 51.6 min (SD 18.4) (p<0.05). The mean time to reach a maximal level of alertness on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale for the propofol group was 15 min (SD 3.6) versus 29 min (SD 10.5) (p=0.001). Although both groups recorded a high level of satisfaction, patients receiving propofol expressed greater overall mean satisfaction with the quality of their sedation at the time of discharge (p<0.05), and reported a return to baseline function sooner in the majority of cases. Propofol achieved comparable levels of efficacy and safety to meperidine/midazolam in our study group. Both were well tolerated with minimal complications.",

    "21": "In the heart, 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one (CGP-37157) inhibits mitochondrial but not sarcolemmal Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. Therefore, CGP-37157 is often used as an experimental tool to study the role of mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange in Ca(2+) homeostasis in various cells, including neurons. However, neurons express several K(+)-dependent (NCKX) and/or K(+)-independent (NCX) isoforms of plasmalemmal Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange not expressed in the sarcolemma. Because it has never been determined whether CGP-37157 inhibits plasmalemmal NCKX and/or NCX isoforms in neurons, we tested this possibility. As an index of NCKX and/or NCX activity, we studied Na-dependent and gramicidin-induced 45Ca(2+) accumulation in the presence and absence of K(+), respectively. In primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, CGP-37157 with IC(50) of 13 microM inhibited over 70% of plasmalemmal NCX activity (P<0.01) but not NCKX activity. Our data suggest that the effects of CGP-37157 on neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis include inhibition of certain plasmalemmal NCX isoform(s). Because cerebellar granule cells robustly express NCX3 transcripts, which are not expressed in the heart, it appears that this isoform may be CGP-37157 sensitive.", 
    "22": "Screening of traditional medicines has proven invaluable to drug development and discovery. Utilizing activity-guided purification, we previously reported the isolation of a list of flavonoids from the medicinal herb Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, one of which manifested an affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor (BDZR) comparable to that of the synthetic anxiolytic diazepam (K(i)=6.4 nM). In the present study, this high-affinity, naturally occurring flavonoid derivative, 5,7,2'-trihydroxy-6,8-dimethoxyflavone (K36), was chosen for further functional and behavioral characterization. K36 inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding to native BDZR with a K(i) value of 6.05 nM. In electrophysiological experiments K36 potentiated currents mediated by rat recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This potentiation was characterized by a threshold (1 nM) and half-maximal stimulation (24 nM) similar to diazepam. This enhancement was demonstrated to act via the BDZR, since co-application of 1 microM of the BDZR antagonist Ro15-1788 reversed the potentiation. Oral administration of K36 produced significant BDZR-mediated anxiolysis in the mice elevated plus-maze, which was abolished upon co-administration of Ro15-1788. Sedation, myorelaxation and motor incoordination were not observed in the chosen dosage regimen. Structure-activity relationships utilizing synthetic flavonoids with different 2' substituents on the flavone backbone supported that 2'-hydroxyl-substitution is a critical moiety on flavonoids with regard to BDZR affinities. These results further underlined the potential of flavonoids as therapeutics for the treatment of BDZR-associated syndromes.", 
    "23": "Effects of cytochrome b(5) (b(5)) on catalytic activities of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5, CYP3A4, and CYP3A7 coexpressed with human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in Escherichia coli membranes were investigated using 14 substrates. The activities of CYP3A5 were enhanced by addition of b(5) in approximately one third of the substrates employed in this study. Such enhancement by b(5) was roughly similar to that of CYP3A4, while the activities of CYP3A7 were not enhanced by b(5) with any substrates employed. V(max) values for midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and amitriptyline N-demethylation by CYP3A5 were increased about twice by addition of b(5), which was also seen with CYP3A4, although the extent of the effects of b(5) on S(50) (K(m)) and Hill coefficient differed dependent on substrates used. In contrast, b(5) did not alter any of these kinetic parameters of CYP3A7. The effects of b(5) on kinetic parameters of CYP3A5 were similar to those of CYP3A4 but not CYP3A7. These results suggest that roles of b(5) in drug oxidation activities of CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 are different from those of CYP3A7.", 
    "24": "There is clinical evidence of anxiolytic action of several anti-epileptic drugs. We evaluated the effects of levetiracetam (Keppra), a new generation anti-epileptic drug, in the plus-maze animal test for anxiolytic activity. Levetiracetam at 17 and 54 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) was without effect when tested in naive rats. A modified version of the test was subsequently used in which open-arm exploration was decreased by exposure of the rats to a four-open-arm maze 24 h prior to drug treatment and testing. Under these conditions of enhanced anxiety, levetiracetam, 5.4 to 54 mg/kg, dose-dependently increased open-arm exploration. Chlordiazepoxide 5 mg/kg had similar effects although buspirone 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg was inactive. The results with levetiracetam substantiate similar findings of its anxiolytic actions against chlordiazepoxide withdrawal-induced anxiety in mice and in a modified Vogel test in rats and support a potential clinical use of this drug in anxiety states.", 
    "25": "Addiction provides fertile ground for the application of the tools of functional neuroimaging. They can be divided into studies of neural activity and neurotransmitter function. Using the former, both opiates and stimulants cause a global decrease in brain metabolism. Against this background, acute doses have still been shown to produce relative increases in brain activation in specific regions, e.g., anterior cingulate, thalamus, and amygdala. These are also regions frequently found with cue-exposure paradigms. Our own work on cue-exposure has shown that heroin-related stimuli provoke activation of the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal regions. Brain metabolism has also been shown to increase in drug withdrawal from alcohol and cocaine. Neurotransmitter studies have shown that in alcohol dependence, GABA(A)-benzodiazepine (GABA-BDZ) receptors are reduced in a number of brain regions and suggest that there may be 'capacity within the system' in some benzodiazepine functions, but tolerance to others, e.g., time asleep. Finally, 11C-Ro15-4513 offers new opportunities for imaging the GABA-BDZ system.", 
    "26": "Here, we summarize recent data pertaining to the effects of GABA(A) receptor modulators on the receptor gene expression in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind tolerance and dependence induced by these drugs. Drug selectivity and intrinsic activity seems to be important to evidence at the molecular level the GABA(A) receptor tolerance. On the contrary, we suggested that all drug tested are equally potentially prone to induce dependence. Our results demonstrate that long-lasting exposure of GABA(A) receptors to endogenous steroids, benzodiazepines and ethanol, as well as their withdrawal, induce marked effects on receptor structure and function. These results suggest the possible synergic action between endogenous steroids and these drugs in modulating the functional activity of specific neuronal populations. We report here that endogenous steroids may play a crucial role in the action of ethanol on dopaminergic neurons.",

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is more effective and more cost-effective than medication. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are equal in efficacy and both are to be preferred to benzodiazepines. Treatment choice depends on the skill of the clinician and the patient's circumstances. Drug treatment should be complemented by behaviour therapy. If the response to an adequate trial of a first-line treatment is poor, another evidence-based treatment should be used. A second opinion can be useful. The presence of severe agoraphobia is a negative prognostic indicator, whereas comorbid depression, if properly treated, has no consistent effect on outcome.",

Mean V(max) values in groups B and C for both 1-hydroxytriazolam (1-OH-TRZ) and 4-hydroxy-triazolam (4-OH-TRZ) formation were significantly greater as compared with groups A and D individually, as well as the net intrinsic clearance (sum of the two pathways). The mean net intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) values were 25.2, 89.8, 78, and 20.6 nl/min/mg protein in A, B, C, and D, respectively. TRZ Cl(int) correlated well with total CYP3A content (r(s) = 0.84; P < 0.0001). Testosterone (TST) inhibited 1-OH-TRZ formation and activated 4-OH-TRZ formation in all age groups, with no significant differences among the groups; this suggests that the drug-drug interaction potential using TRZ and TST as index CYP3A substrates may not change with age. Reduced V(max) and Cl(int) for TRZ hydroxylation and CYP3A protein in livers from elderly men suggest reduced CYP3A gene expression in this group.",

Vital signs for both treatments were comparable and within acceptable clinical limits and communication with the patient was maintained at all times. The median (range) lowest arterial oxygen saturation level recorded for midazolam was 97 (91-99)% compared with 97 (92-100)% for nitrous oxide. The mean (range) recovery time for midazolam was 51.6 (39-65) min and 23.3 (20-34) min for nitrous oxide (P<0.0001).

We describe a classification method which fits descriptor splines to activities, with descriptors selected using a genetic algorithm. This method, which we identify as SFGA, is compared to the well-established techniques of recursive partitioning (RP) and soft independent modeling by class analogy (SIMCA) using five series of compounds: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands, estrogen receptor (ER) ligands, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Only 1-D and 2-D descriptors were used. Approximately 40% of compounds in each series were assigned to a test set, \"cherry-picked\" from the complete set such that they lie outside the training set as much as possible. SFGA produced models that were more predictive for all but the DHFR set, for which SIMCA was most predictive. RP gave the least predictive models for all but the MAO set. A similar trend was observed when using training and test sets to which compounds were randomly assigned and when gradually eliminating compounds from the (designed) training set. The stability of models was examined for the random and reduced sets, where stability means that classification statistics and the selected descriptors are similar for models derived from different sets. Here, SIMCA produced the most stable models, followed by SFGA and RP. We show that a consensus approach that combines all three methods outperforms the single best model for all data sets.",

    "74": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is involved in many cellular functions, including steroidogenesis, oxidative processes, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Secretory and glandular tissues, especially steroid hormone-producing cells, are particularly rich in PBR. To understand the mechanisms of PBR expression and regulation, we established an mRNA expression profile in mouse tissues and cell lines and subsequently mapped the transcription start site and characterized the promoter of the gene. Our findings indicate that PBR tissue mRNA levels are relatively high in kidney, spleen, muscle, lung, adrenal gland, thymus, and stomach; are intermediate in pancreas, uterus, prostate, heart, and testis; and are low in brain and liver. Relatively high levels of PBR mRNA were also observed in the steroid-synthesizing MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells compared with adrenocortical Y1 mouse cells and nonsteroidogenic NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, although PBR protein levels were much higher in both steroidogenic cells compared with fibroblasts. Transcription was initiated primarily at an adenine nucleotide 61 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site, but internal initiation was also observed. A 2.7-kb fragment of the mouse PBR promoter was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed the absence of TATA or CCAAT boxes, but the presence of many putative transcription factor-binding sites, including Sp1/Sp3, AP2, Ik2, AP1, SOX, GATA, and SRY. Functional characterization revealed that two Sp1/Sp3 sites in the proximal promoter are important for basal activity in all cell lines tested and that the steroidogenic MA-10 and Y1 cells use different areas of the promoter compared with nonsteroidogenic NIH-3T3 cells.",

Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine drugs were chosen as model substances. Liquid-phase microextraction based on disposable polypropylene hollow fibres was used in the three-phase extraction of five weak bases from whole blood. The sample work up with the liquid-phase microextraction technique can be impeded by low recovery due to incomplete trapping in the acceptor phase of weakly basic drugs and the complexity of the whole blood matrix. Different parameters related to this problem were experimentally studied. Additionally the stability of the analytes was examined because of low pH in the acceptor phase. The investigation resulted in optimised LPME conditions for the extraction of weak bases from whole blood. The parameters limiting the recovery were evaluated.",

    "80": "Acute effects on the behaviour of the organophosphate insecticide dichlorvos and its standard antidotes possessing behavioural activity, atropine and diazepam, were studied separately and in combinations in male Wistar rats. In the spontaneous locomotor activity test, dichlorvos and diazepam decreased, whereas atropine increased performance. The effect of dichlorvos was obtained at a dose (5 mg/kg) that induced overt intoxication, and could not be reversed during first half hour-period after administration of any combination of drugs. In the other two tests, active avoidance learning and rotarod performance, the effective dose of dichlorvos (2 mg/kg) was devoid of somatic signs of intoxication. In these more sensitive tests, the effective atropine dose (40 mg/kg) completely reversed dichlorvos-induced incapacitation. In the rotarod test, diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) contributed to the incapacitating effect of dichlorvos, and impeded desirable influence of atropine as well. In the active avoidance test, diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) contributed to failure to escape; it did not influence the dichlorvos-induced decrease of avoidance performance, nor did it impair the completely reversing effects of atropine. The results point to the possible summation of acute incapacitating effects of organophosphates and diazepam on motor performance, which seems to be, at least partly, antagonized by sufficiently high doses of atropine. However, taking into account the long-term neuroprotective role of the anticonvulsant diazepam, and hence its delayed beneficial influences on behaviour, the immediate testing of atropine/diazepam treatment of organophosphate intoxication in active avoidance paradigm could possess beside sensitivity the predictive value as well.", 
    "81": "In schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, cortical and subcortical motor organization is influenced by primary disease conditions and neuroleptic treatment. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging patients with schizophrenia were compared, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn), under stable treatment with olanzapine (n = 7; OL) or haloperidol (n = 7; HA) to healthy controls (n = 7; HC), patients with schizophrenia without any neuroleptic treatment (n = 7; UN) and to patients with left (n = 7; LHP)- and right (n = 7; RHP)-sided hemiparkinsonism. All subjects performed a unilateral left-handed fingertapping task. All groups had significant activation in the contralateral motor cortex and the putamen (P < 0.001). Different activation patterns between groups within cortical and subcortical regions of interest were revealed. In particular, different subcortical activation patterns were found between OL- and HA-treated patients with schizophrenia. Activation of the contralateral putamen was increased in right-sided hemiparkinsonism. Significant thalamus activation was found in patients under neuroleptic treatment as well as in hemiparkinsonism, whereas the thalamus was not activated in untreated patients with schizophrenia and in healthy controls. Comparing dopaminergic depletion in hemiparkinsonism and dopaminergic blockade in HA-treated patients, an increase in activation was found within the contralateral primary motorcortex, in the ipsilateral putamen and the contralateral thalamus in hemiparkinsonism. In contrast, activation of the contralateral putamen differed between OL and HA, LHP and RHP. These findings confirm that cortical and subcortical motor-related brain loop functions are influenced by both primary neuropsychiatric conditions as well as by treatment effects. It is hypothesized that dopaminergic depletion in hemiparkinsonism and dopaminergic blockade under neuroleptic agents influence basal ganglia activity in a different way; in particular regarding functional connectivity. Basal ganglia and thalamic interaction seems to have a key role in cortical-subcortical interaction.",

    "86": "In this report, we describe the case of a caucasian male patient, aged 42 years, suffering from severe treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks and from severe major depression, for which he was treated with a course of electroconvulsive therapy. During electroconvulsive treatment, anesthesia was difficult to induce with etomidate and, once, propofol. Bispectral indices recordings (assessing the depth of anesthesia) revealed a much shorter duration of loss of responsiveness compared to a control patient receiving also a course of electroconvulsive therapy. Since GABA receptor-mediated regulation of cortical excitability is important with respect to general anesthesia, we investigated the density of GABA(A) receptors with (123)I-iomazenil SPECT and found a clearly diminished binding of the radiotracer in the right frontal and orbitotemporal regions compared to the recordings in a 38-year-old healthy male control. Genetic analysis of the exons 7 and 8 of the GABRB1-3 genes coding for the beta1-3 subunits of the GABA(A) receptors revealed a silent G to A substitution in the third position of amino acid 257 of the beta1-subunit. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a link between insensitivity to anesthetic agents and altered GABA(A) receptor function in a clinical case. Whereas reduced GABA(A) receptor-binding capacity has been investigated in anxiety disorders, this has not been the case in depressive disorders. This case illustrates how clinical observations in psychiatry can prompt investigation by modern techniques and potentially link clinics and basic sciences. No conclusion can, however, be made about casual links in this single case [corrected].",

    "92": "High levels of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), the alternative-binding site for diazepam, are part of the aggressive human breast cancer cell phenotype in vitro. We examined PBR levels and distribution in normal tissue and tumors from multiple cancer types by immunohistochemistry. Among normal breast tissues, fibroadenomas, primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas, there is a progressive increase in PBR levels parallel to the invasive and metastatic ability of the tumor (p < 0.0001). In colorectal and prostate carcinomas, PBR levels were also higher in tumor than in the corresponding non-tumoral tissues and benign lesions (p < 0.0001). In contrast, PBR was highly concentrated in normal adrenal cortical cells and hepatocytes, whereas in adrenocortical tumors and hepatomas PBR levels were decreased. Moreover, malignant skin tumors showed decreased PBR expression compared with normal skin. These results indicate that elevated PBR expression is not a common feature of aggressive tumors, but rather may be limited to certain cancers, such as those of breast, colon-rectum and prostate tissues, where elevated PBR expression is associated with tumor progression. Thus, we propose that PBR overexpression could serve as a novel prognostic indicator of an aggressive phenotype in breast, colorectal and prostate cancers.",

To test this possibility, we compared the effects of two post-stress housing conditions, in pairs or in groups of 10-12 animals per cage, on the behavior of rats tested in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) 24 hr after stress. We also included positive control groups to compare the effects of a standard anxiolytic, diazepam, with those of vehicle. Confirming previous results, diazepam increased the percentage of entries and time spent in the open arms (vehicle, % open entries: 37.0+/-2.7, % time spent in open arms: 17.6+/-1.9; diazepam, % open entries: 46.7+/-2.7, % time spent in open arms: 39.1+/-3.9).

Diazepam (0.25-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and buspirone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) attenuated equally and dose-dependently the USV responses elicited by both aversive stimuli. Air-puff-elicited USV was specifically attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by the anxiolytic properties of several psychotropic agents: diazepam (1.0-10.0 mg/kg, p.o.), buspirone (10.0-100.0 mg/kg, p.o.), 8-OH-DPAT (0.01-0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). Haloperidol (0.2-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) weakly attenuated the USV response. Imipramine (0.2-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) which has no anxiolytic property had no effect.

    "95": "Recent research on CYP3A5 in vitro and in humans has provided discordant information on whether CYP3A5 plays a significant role in the metabolism of CYP3A substrates in vivo. For example, six separate studies have reported CYP3A5 to contribute between 2 and 60% of the total hepatic CYP3A. Suggested explanations for the reported differences in hepatic CYP3A5 levels are evaluated in this article. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the contribution of CYP3A5 (in addition to CYP3A4) to the metabolism of a \"midazolam\"-type substrate based on recently published in vitro and clinical data is compared with the results of two in vivo studies that investigated the influence of CYP3A5 genotype on midazolam pharmacokinetics. The sensitivity analysis predicts an approximately 3-fold lower AUCoral for midazolam for those expressing the highest hepatic and intestinal levels of CYP3A5 (e.g., possessing CYP3A5*1 alleles) compared with those individuals who express insignificant amounts of CYP3A5, assuming CYP3A4 levels are the same in both groups and that CYP3A5 levels do not exceed those of CYP3A4 in CYP3A5*1 homozygotes. In contrast, the two in vivo studies show no statistically significant influence of CYP3A5 genotype on midazolam pharmacokinetics. The discordance between the prediction and the results from the two in vivo studies is discussed.", 
    "96": "The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of nitrido technetium-99m complexes for imaging benzodiazepine receptors are described. The design was performed by selecting the precursor biologically active substrate desmethyldiazepam, and the reactive metal-containing fragment [(99m)Tc(N)(PXP)](2+) (PXP = diphosphine ligand) as molecular building-blocks for assembling the structure of the final radiopharmaceuticals through the application of the so-called 'bifunctional' and 'integrated' approaches. This required the synthesis of the ligands H(2)BZ1, H(2)C1, and H(2)C2 (Figures 1 and 2) derived from desmethyldiazepam. In turn, these ligands were reacted with [(99m)Tc(N)(PXP)](2+) to afford the complexes [(99m)Tc(N)(PXP)(L)] (L = BZ1, C1, C2). The chemical nature of the resulting Tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals was investigated using chromatographic methods, and by comparison with the analogous complexes prepared with the long-lived isotope Tc-99g and characterized by spectroscopic and analytical methods. Results showed that the complexes [(99m)Tc(N)(PXP)(L)] are neutral and possess an asymmetrical five-coordinated structure in which two different bidentate ligands, PXP and L, are coordinated to the same Tc[triple bond]N core. With the ligand H(2)BZ1, two isomers were obtained depending on the syn or anti orientation of the pendant benzodiazepine group relative to the Tc[triple bond]N multiple bond. Biodistribution studies of Tc-99m complexes were carried out in rats, and affinity for benzodiazepine receptors was assessed through in vitro binding experiments on isolated rat's cerebral membranes using the corresponding Tc-99g complexes.",

Improvements in health indices and side effects were seen among all 3 groups, but the specific benefits depended on the preswitch antipsychotic. For example, patients switched from olanzapine experienced a mean weight loss of 1.76 kg (P < 0.0001), those switched from risperidone had a lesser reduction in weight (-0.86 kg; P = 0.015), and those switched from conventionals had a nonsignificant increase (+0.27 kg; P = 0.3). Prolactin levels decreased among those switched from risperidone (P < 0.0001) or conventionals (P = 0.05), but not for patients switched from olanzapine. EPS improved among those switched from conventionals (P < 0.0001) and to a lesser extent among those switched from risperidone (P < 0.01), but not in those changed from olanzapine (NS). Thus, in these studies, switching to ziprasidone in patients with continuing symptoms or side effects on their current medication was often associated with improved health status indices, lowered prolactin levels, or less EPS, with the magnitude benefit consistent with the known side-effect profile of the preswitch antipsychotic.", 
    "98": "Sustained response to antipsychotic therapy is an important outcome measure for patients with psychotic disorders. Placebo control in studies of relapse prevention contributes valuable information yet provokes much debate. This study, using placebo as a control, evaluated olanzapine's efficacy in preventing a psychotic relapse. Participants were stable minimally symptomatic outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study included 4 phases: (1) 4-day to 9-day screening/evaluation (N = 583), (2) 6-week conversion to open-label olanzapine (N = 493; 10-20 mg/d), (3) 8-week stabilization on olanzapine (N = 458; 10-20 mg/d), and (4) 52-week randomized (2:1), double-blind maintenance with olanzapine (N = 224; 10-20 mg/d) or placebo (N = 102). Primary relapse criteria were clinically significant changes in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) positive item cluster or rehospitalization due to positive symptoms. Statistical methodology allowed sequential real-time estimation of efficacy across blinded treatment groups and multiple interim analyses, which permitted study termination when efficacy was significantly different between treatments. A significant between-treatment difference emerged 210 days after first patient randomization to double-blind treatment. Thus, 151 (46.3%) of the randomized patients were discontinued early and 34 (10.4%) of the planned patient enrollment were not required. The olanzapine group had a significantly longer time to relapse (P < 0.0001) than the placebo group. The 6-month cumulative estimated relapse rate (Kaplan-Meier) was 5.5% for olanzapine-treated patients versus 55.2% for placebo-treated patients. The design of this study enabled appropriate statistical testing of the primary hypothesis while minimizing exposure of patients to a less effective treatment than olanzapine. In remitted stabilized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, olanzapine demonstrated a positive benefit-to-risk profile in relapse prevention.", 
    "99": "Standardized extracts from the Ginkgo biloba tree are purported to exert positive neurocognitive effects and may also be useful in the treatment of a variety of vascular and other disorders. This dietary supplement is among the most commonly used herbal preparations in the world. The objective of this study was to assess in normal volunteers (n = 12) the influence of standardized Ginkgo biloba (GB) on the activity of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A4 normal volunteers phenotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. Probe substrates dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 activity) and alprazolam (CYP 3A4 activity) were co-administered orally at baseline, and following treatment with GB (120 mg twice daily) for 14 days. Urinary concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan were quantified and dextromethorphan metabolic ratios (DMRs) were determined at baseline and after GB treatment. Likewise, plasma samples were collected (0-60 hrs) for alprazolam pharmacokinetics at baseline and after GB treatment to assess effects on CYP 3A4 activity. Validated HPLC methods were used to quantify all compounds and relevant metabolites. No statistically significant differences were found between baseline and post-GB treatment DMRs indicating a lack of effect on CYP2D6. For alprazolam there was a 17% decrease in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC); (P<0.05). However, the half-life of elimination was not significantly different after GB administration indicating a lack of hepatic CYP3A4 induction. We conclude that standardized extracts of GB at recommended doses are unlikely to significantly alter the disposition of co-administered medications primarily dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways for elimination.", 
    "100": "The GABA-modulating and GABA-mimetic activities of the monoterpenoid thymol were explored on human GABAA and Drosophila melanogaster homomeric RDLac GABA receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, voltage-clamped at -60 mV. The site of action of thymol was also investigated. Thymol, 1-100 microm, resulted in a dose-dependent potentiation of the EC20 GABA response in oocytes injected with either alpha1beta3gamma2s GABAA subunit cDNAs or the RDLac subunit RNA. At 100 microm thymol, current amplitudes in response to GABA were 416+/-72 and 715+/-85% of controls, respectively. On both receptors, thymol, 100 microm, elicited small currents in the absence of GABA. The EC50 for GABA at alpha1beta3gamma2s GABAA receptors was reduced by 50 microm thymol from 15+/-3 to 4+/-1 microm, and the Hill slope changed from 1.35+/-0.14 to 1.04+/-0.16; there was little effect on the maximum GABA response. Thymol (1-100 microm) potentiation of responses to EC20 GABA for alpha1beta1gamma2s, alpha6beta3gamma2s and alpha1beta3gamma2s human GABAA receptors was almost identical, arguing against actions at benzodiazepine or loreclezole sites. Neither flumazenil, 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline (3-HMC), nor 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha, 20alpha-diol (5alpha-pregnanediol) affected thymol potentiation of the GABA response at alpha1beta3gamma2s receptors, providing evidence against actions at the benzodiazepine/beta-carboline or steroid sites. Thymol stimulated the agonist actions of pentobarbital and propofol on alpha1beta3gamma2s receptors, consistent with a mode of action distinct from that of either compound. These data suggest that thymol potentiates GABAA receptors through a previously unidentified binding site.", 
    "101": "The mitochondrial 18kDa peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a high affinity cholesterol binding protein, has been shown to interact with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) and this interaction was assumed to be involved in the regulation of heme biosynthesis and porphyrin-based photodynamic therapy in cancer. In order to test this hypothesis recombinant mouse PBR was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant gene product showed in E. coli protoplasts specific affinity for PPIX binding. PPIX could displace PK 11195 binding. Moreover, induced PBR protein expression in E. coli protoplasts caused an uptake of PPIX that could be completely inhibited by cholesterol and to a lesser extent inhibited by PK 11195 and Ro5-4864. These results suggest that PBR, in addition to its role in cholesterol and coproporphyrinogen III transport, is also directing the mitochondrial PPIX import, a function that can be ascribed to the 18kDa PBR protein alone.", 
    "102": "Short-term exposure of adult rats to nitrous oxide (N2O), an inhalational anesthetic and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonist, causes a reversible neurotoxic vacuole reaction in neurons of the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex (PC/RSC) which resembles that caused by low doses of other NMDA antagonists. Since high doses or prolonged exposure to other NMDA antagonists can cause neurons to die, we assessed whether prolonged N2O exposure might also cause neuronal cell death. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 150-vol% N2O (approximately EC50 for N2O anesthesia in rats) for various durations from 1 to 16 h. The time course for onset and disappearance of the reversible vacuole reaction was studied, as was the time course and dose requirement for triggering cell death. A maximum vacuole reaction was observed in PC/RSC neurons in brains examined immediately after 3 h of 150-vol% N2O exposure and the same magnitude of vacuole reaction was observed when brains were examined immediately after a longer period of N2O exposure. When N2O was terminated at 3 h and the rats were killed 1 h later, the vacuole reaction was markedly diminished and if the rats were killed 3 h later the vacuole reaction had completely disappeared. Prolonged exposure to 150-vol% N2O (for 8 h or more) caused neuronal cell death which was detectable by silver staining 32 h later. Concurrently administered GABAergic agents, diazepam (an i.v. anesthetic), or isoflurane (an inhalational anesthetic), prevented this cell death reaction. Our findings demonstrate that short-term exposure of adult rats to N2O causes injury to PC/RSC neurons that is rapidly reversible, and prolonged N2O exposure causes neuronal cell death. These neurotoxic effects, including the cell death reaction, can be prevented by coadministration of GABAmimetic anesthetic agents. Duration of NMDA receptor blockade appears to be an important determinant of whether neurons are reversibly injured or are driven to cell death by an NMDA antagonist drug.", 
    "103": "Few data exist on the distribution of pharmaceutical costs for inpatient surgical procedures across different drug categories (eg, analgesia, anti-infectives). The goals of this study were to categorize pharmaceuticals administered to patients after joint replacement surgery and then to take the hospital's perspective and quantify the pharmacy cost of delivering postoperative analgesia to these patients. Two hundred ninety-eight patients undergoing unilateral hip replacement (n = 145), unilateral knee replacement (n = 121), or bilateral knee replacement (n = 32) were studied retrospectively. For each patient, we determined what hospital resources (eg, supplies) were utilized by each patient in each of 12 different hospital departments. This was done to determine what fraction of overall hospital costs was incurred as a result of pharmacy. Then, we classified the hundreds of items (from acetaminophen to warfarin) included as pharmacy costs into 1 of the following categories: postoperative epidural analgesia, opioids, nonopioids, respiratory, gastrointestinal, naloxone, anti-infective, anticoagulant/antiplatelets, miscellaneous, cardiovascular, pharmacist clinical intervention, intravenous fluids, and benzodiazepines. The pharmacy costs for epidural analgesia, opioids, and nonopioids were summed to compute the fraction of pharmacy costs attributed to postoperative analgesia. The results showed that 3.3% (95% confidence interval CI, 2.7% to 3.6%) of total hospitalization costs were pharmacy costs, which averaged 560 US dollars (95% CI, 500 US dollars to 620 US dollars) for hip replacement, 595 US dollars (95% CI, 551 to 639 US dollars) for knee replacement, and 922 US dollars (95% CI, 588 US dollars to 1256 US dollars) for bilateral knee replacement surgery. An average of 9.9% (95% CI, 7.37% to 12.43%) of total pharmacy costs for the 3 surgery types were for postoperative epidural analgesia, whereas opioids averaged 19.9% (95% CI, 18.67% to 21.13%), and nonopioids averaged 0.8% (95% CI 0.65% to 0.95%) of pharmacy costs. Thus, analgesics accounted for approximately 31% of pharmacy costs. The pharmacy cost of delivering postoperative analgesia to patients undergoing joint replacement surgery represents 1% of the total costs of surgery. Almost two thirds of the analgesic costs were for opioids.", 
    "104": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has broad spectrum psychotropic effects, affecting dopamine receptors 1, 2, and 3, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C, muscarinic, alpha-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic, and histamine H-sites. This unique pharmacologic property allows clinicians to use the agent as an adjunct for pain control, particularly when the intensity of the pain is exacerbated by dysregulation of neurotransmitters. Three case studies are presented from a suburban family practice setting in which olanzapine has been successfully used to regulate pain perception in adults with chronic pain.", 
    "105": "For neuroprotective therapy of neurodegenerative diseases creatine treatment has gained special interest because creatine has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, accumulate in the human brain in vivo and cause delayed neuronal cell death in a large number of animal models. Here, we used the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy to determine whether creatine administration is able to attenuate the epilepsy-associated decrease in hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentrations, impairment of mitochondrial function and neuronal cell loss. In vivo1H-NMR spectroscopy showed, in epileptic rats after creatine administration, higher hippocampal NAA concentrations, suggesting improved neuronal survival. However, in vitro observation of hippocampal slices from creatine-treated epileptic rats revealed a more pronounced loss of pyramidal neurons and decrease in activity of mitochondrial enzymes in hippocampal subfields. This indicates that NAA concentrations measured by in vivo1H-NMR spectroscopy reflect alterations of metabolism rather than neuronal cell densities. Our data indicate an adverse effect of creatine on neuronal survival under conditions of enhanced neuronal activity.", 
    "106": "Classical benzodiazepines such as diazepam are widely used tranquillisers and hypnotics in various neuropsychiatric diseases including alcohol-related disorders. One of the major drawbacks of benzodiazepine therapy, however, is an exacerbation of the sedative and hypnotic effects associated with alcohol intake, even at low doses. Even though the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex is a common target for the actions of both classes of drugs, the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced pharmacological properties of the combined use of benzodiazepines and alcohol remain to be identified. The present experiments aimed at clarifying which of the GABAA receptor subtypes mediate the augmented hypnotic-like and sedative effects of combined diazepam and alcohol using the righting reflex and motor activity assays, respectively, in histidine-to-arginine point mutated mice that possess diazepam-insensitive alpha1-, alpha2-, alpha3- or alpha5-GABAA receptors. The combination of diazepam (2 or 3 mg/kg) and ethanol (3 g/kg) induced loss of righting reflex with a significantly dose-dependent increase of the latency to its full recovery in wild-type, alpha1(H101R), alpha3(H126R) and alpha5(H105R) but not in alpha2(H101R) mice. A combined treatment with diazepam (1 mg/kg) and ethanol (2.5 g/kg) precipitated motor inhibition similarly in wild-type and alpha2(H101R) mice. Responsiveness of the alpha2(H101R) mice to ethanol alone was similar to that of wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that induction of loss of righting reflex by combined diazepam and alcohol is closely dependent on the activation of the alpha2-GABAA receptors by the benzodiazepine whereas precipitation of sedation involves GABAA receptors other than the alpha2-GABAA receptors.", 
    "107": "The tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP) of the brainstem mediates food reward in food-sated animals and opiate reward in drug-naive animals. In the present study, we examine the effect of excitotoxic lesions of the TPP on sexual behaviour in naive and experienced male rats. Male, Long-Evans rats received either 0.25 micro L injections of NMDA (4.2 micro g/side) or vehicle (shams) into the TPP. In sexually naive males, complete bilateral TPP lesions decreased all measure of copulation (i.e. mounts, intromissions and ejaculations), prevented acquisition of conditioned sexual excitement, decreased approach preference for a receptive female over a non-receptive one, and decreased non-contact erections; unilateral or bilateral posterior-sparing TPP lesions did not affect any of these measures. Conversely, in sexually experienced males, lesions not only failed to disrupt copulation, but also increased conditioned sexual excitement, decreased post-ejaculatory interval and blocked the effect of prolonged copulation on conditioned sexual excitement. Following differential pairing of distinctive environments with and without copulation, sham males with sexual experience displayed a significant preference for the environment paired with copulation, whereas the lesion males with sexual experience displayed a significant aversion for the environment paired with copulation. These findings indicate that the TPP is critical for the acquisition of copulation in naive males and mediates the rewarding consequences of copulation in experienced males. Together these findings demonstrate that the TPP mediates sexual reward, but that sexual experience is not sufficient to produce a deprivation state.", 
    "108": "This paper describes the consequences of changing from methadone maintenance treatment focussed primarily on elimination of all illicit drug use and social reintegration to patient-centred care. Counselling (formerly mandatory) became optional, patients were retained in treatment despite continued illicit drug use, the ceiling on methadone doses was removed, patient input became a part of methadone prescribing and the number of patients in treatment more than doubled. Across three cohorts (before, during and after the program was redesigned) the mean daily dose of methadone increased (50.4 mg +/- 2.5, 72.6 mg +/- 2.4, 92.2 mg +/- 4.0, respectively). The number of physician visits increased linearly with cohort while the number of therapist visits was unchanged overall. Two-year treatment retention was not significantly different (73%, 69% and 67%, respectively). In all three cohorts there was a significant reduction in opioid and benzodiazepine use but not cocaine use over the first six months of treatment.", 
    "109": "There is widespread agreement that estimates of adolescent drug use prevalence from the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and Monitoring the Future (MTF) are subject to considerable measurement error. Nevertheless, some have suggested that trends over time in these prevalence estimates probably reflect true trends in drug use, since underreporting may be assumed to be constant over time. A recent National Research Council report criticizes this assumption on logical grounds. The present study examines adolescent drug use responses on the NHSDA and MTF for evidence of \"drug omission,\" \"jargon confusion\" and \"conceptual confusion,\" three types of misreporting expected to vary in magnitude with changes in drug use practices and changes in survey items. Results demonstrate that adolescent drug users are significantly more likely than adults to report use of drugs not listed in the NHSDA. Among adolescents who wrote in the \"other\" drugs they used, 66% and 86% of hallucinogen and inhalant responses showed confusion over the meaning of the pharmacological terms used in the NHSDA. Almost 20% of MTF respondents who report lifetime use of Rohypnol or ecstasy, when specifically queried about these drugs, deny lifetime use of any substances in the drug classes intended to assess use of Rohypnol and ecstasy. MTF respondents reporting lifetime use of PCP underreport use of hallucinogens at rates that vary substantially over time, from a high of 45% (in 1986), to a low of just 8% (in 1998). The implications of these findings for adolescent drug use prevalence estimation and survey design are discussed.", 
    "110": "The performance of two commercially available capillary LC pumps (MicroPro (Eldex, USA), Evolution 200 (ProLab, Switzerland)) generating really splitless gradients in the microliter per minute range was tested in detail concerning their applicability for routine drug discovery. A standard method to study metabolic stability against CYP450 isoform 3A4 was selected. This method was transformed into a fast splitless capillary LC-MS method. Both pumps generated reproducible gradients at flows of 5-10 microl/min within 10-15 min. Although gradient formation of the MicroPro system was very reproducible, its equilibration time was too long for fast gradients around 5 microl/min. The Evolution 200 pump offered a good performance with 180 microm i.d. columns at a flow rate of 6 microl/min. The precision of the retention time of the internal standard (ISTD) varied between 1.4 and 3.4% (n = 131-152, three different columns tested). Up to 800 injections of sufficient performance on one column and a stable enough response of the ISTD for 16 h sequence duration were obtained. Accuracy between 95 and 105% and precision < or = 8.4% for 1'-hydroxylated midozolam were reached. The IC50 values of the miniaturized assay (drug candidate BAL4815 1.7 +/- 0.5, itraconazole 0.46 +/- 0.06, and ketoconazole 0.12 +/- 0.01 microM) agreed well with those of the conventional approach.

Bolus doses of flumazenil are usually adequate to achieve reversal; however, when medical conditions may lead to a prolonged half-life of the benzodiazepine involved, continuous infusion may be warranted. A 67-year-old man with chlordiazepoxide toxicity required a 9-day infusion of flumazenil to prevent resedation and respiratory insufficiency; he initially was admitted to the hospital for alcohol detoxification. Concomitant medical conditions and the metabolism characteristics of each benzodiazepine must dictate the agent of choice. When measures are required to ensure adequate recovery of a patient's respiratory function and mental awareness, such as in patients with benzodiazepine toxicity, consideration of continuous-infusion flumazenil is warranted.",

    "131": "The characteristics of the patients were similar among these groups. The patients undergoing the Stretta procedure required significantly more sedative medication than those undergoing colonoscopy or EUS. The Stretta procedure time and recovery time were significantly longer than the colonoscopy procedure time and recovery time. The Stretta procedure time was also significantly longer than the EUS procedure time, but the Stretta recovery time was not significantly longer than the EUS recovery time.", 
    "132": "Although this study is small and not randomized, it provides useful information regarding how endoscopic procedures compare with one another. Furthermore, these findings have implications for determining endoscopy unit staffing, work equivalency, and appropriate reimbursement.", 
    "133": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG), a noninvasive technique for evaluation of epileptic patients, records magnetic fields during neuronal electrical activity within the brain. Anaesthesia experience for MEG has not yet been reported.", 
    "134": "We retrospectively reviewed records of 48 paediatric patients undergoing MEG under anaesthesia. Thirty-one patients (nonprotocol group) were managed according to the anaesthesiologist's discretion. Premedication included oral midazolam, chloral hydrate or fentanyl oralet, intravenous midazolam or inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, alone or in combination. A subsequent protocol group (17 patients) received chloral hydrate as premedication and propofol for maintenance of anaesthesia.", 
    "135": "There was an overall 25% failure of interictal activity and localization on the MEG scan. In the nonprotocol group, 11 scans failed (35.5%). Of these, eight (72.7%) received midazolam orally. Only one failure (5.8%) was recorded in the protocol group in a patient who received chloral hydrate as sedation supplemented by sevoflurane.", 
    "136": "In our experience, midazolam premedication resulted in a high MEG failure rate (73%). Chloral hydrate premedication and propofol maintenance resulted in a lower incidence of MEG failure (5.8%). General anaesthesia with a continuous infusion of propofol or sevoflurane appears acceptable, although, lighter levels of anaesthesia might be required to avoid interference with interictal activity of the brain.", 
    "137": "Newer antipsychotic medications have been reported to enhance cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. Head to head studies with double-blind methods are still relatively few in number.", 
    "138": "To compare the relative cognitive enhancing effects of ziprasidone and olanzapine in the treatment of acutely ill inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.", 
    "139": "In this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-designed trial, patients were randomized to ziprasidone or olanzapine. No patient who had ever received a complete treatment trial with either of these medications previously was entered into the study. Cognitive testing measuring attention, motor speed, memory, executive functioning, and verbal skills were performed on all patients at baseline and endpoint.", 
    "140": "Treatment with either ziprasidone or olanzapine was associated with statistically significant improvements from baseline in attention, memory, working memory, motor speed, and executive functions. Treatment with olanzapine was also associated with a statistically significant improvement in verbal fluency. No statistically significant differences between these medications were found in the magnitude of improvement from baseline on any of the cognitive measures (other than verbal fluency in an exploratory analysis). Observed changes were not associated with changes in clinical symptoms measured using the PANSS or changes in movement disorders.", 
    "141": "During 6 weeks of treatment, ziprasidone and olanzapine demonstrated substantial and comparable cognitive-enhancing effects relative to previous treatment. These effects were noted in all aspects of cognitive functioning previously proven to predict functional outcome in schizophrenia. No overall differences were detected between the medications in terms of the extent of cognitive enhancement.", 
    "142": "It has been reported that fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of various cytochrome P450 enzymes, markedly inhibits the metabolism of several drugs. The purpose of the present study was to examine a possible interaction between fluvoxamine and quazepam. Twelve healthy male volunteers received fluvoxamine 50 mg/day or placebo for 14 days in a double-blind randomized crossover manner, and on the 4th day they received a single oral 20-mg dose of quazepam. Blood samplings and evaluation of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Stanford Sleepiness Scale were conducted up to 240 hours after quazepam dosing. Plasma concentrations of quazepam and its active metabolites 2-oxoquazepam (OQ) and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (DOQ) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fluvoxamine did not change plasma concentrations of quazepam but significantly decreased those of OQ from 6 to 12 hours and those of DOQ from 3 to 48 hours. The AUC ratio of OQ to quazepam was significantly lower in the fluvoxamine phase. Fluvoxamine did not affect psychomotor function at most of the time points. The present study suggests that fluvoxamine slightly inhibits the metabolism of quazepam to OQ, but this interaction appears to have minimal clinical significance.", 
    "143": "We examined the effects of methamphetamine (METH) on monoaminergic (i.e. dopamine and serotonin) axonal markers and glial cell activation in the rat brain. Our findings indicate that the loss of dopamine transporters (DAT), serotonin transporters (5-HTT), vesicular monoamine transporter type-2 (VMAT-2) and glial cell activation induced by METH in the striatum and in the central gray are consistent with a degenerative process. Our novel finding of METH effects on monoaminergic neurons in the central gray may have important implications on METH-induced hyperthermia. In other brain regions examined, DAT and 5-HTT deficits after METH administration were present in the absence of lasting changes in VMAT-2 levels or glial cell activation. Brain regions exhibiting protracted deficits in DAT and/or 5-HTT and VMAT-2 levels also expressed increased levels of [(3)H]-R-PK11195 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, a quantitative marker of glial cell activation. Immunohistochemical assessment of microglia and astrocytes confirmed the PBR results. Microglia activation was more pronounced than astrocytosis in affected regions in most METH-exposed brains with the exception of a small number of rats that were most severely affected by METH based on loss of body weight. In these rats, both microglia and astrocytes were highly activated and expressed a distinct regional pattern suggestive of widespread brain injury. The reason for the pattern of glial cell activation in this group of rats is not currently known but it may be associated with METH-induced hyperthermia. In summary, our findings suggest two neurotoxic endpoints in the brain of METH-exposed animals. Brain regions exhibiting DAT and 5-HTT deficits that co-localize with decreased VMAT-2 levels and glial cell activation may represent monoaminergic terminal degeneration. However, the DAT and 5-HTT deficits in brain regions lacking a deficit in VMAT-2 and glial cell activation may reflect drug-induced modulation of these plasma membrane proteins.", 
    "144": "In acupuncture practice of animals, preanesthetics sometimes are needed. The purpose of this study was to select the ideal chemical restraint at acupuncture for gastric motility. Nine healthy mixed breed dogs weighed 10-21 kg and aged 1-3 years old were used in this study. Two EMG surface electrodes were placed between the seromuscular and the mucosal layer of pylorus. Twenty minutes after feeding normal gastric motility was recorded for 60 minutes using physiograph (Narco-Biosystem). Then preanesthetic treated-gastric motility was observed for 30 minutes. Preanesthetics used were xylazine, diazepam, and acepromazine. Acupuncture needles were inserted to BL-21 (Wei-Yu) acupoint, and then changes of gastric motility were recorded for 60 minutes. The gastric motility following xylazine administration (1 mg/kg, IV) was markedly decreased. BL-21 (Wei-Yu) acupoints stimulation did not alter xylazine-induced depression of gastric motility. The diazepam (1 mg/kg IV) treated-gastric motility was increased mildly 20 minutes after drug administration. BL-21 (Wei-Yu) acupoint stimulation after diazepam administration enhanced gastric motility significantly. The gastric motility following acepromazine (0.3 mg/kg, IM) administration was not changed compared with normal gastric motility. Application of traditional acupuncture at BL-21 (Wei-Yu) significantly increased the gastric motility. Based on these results, acepromazine and diazepam could be acceptable chemical restraints for acupuncture therapy of gastric motility, but xylazine couldn't be."
