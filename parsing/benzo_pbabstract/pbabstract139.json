This study describes the development of a patient-reported assessment to detect likely placebo responders. A novel scale, the Placebo Response Screening Scale (PRSS), was developed to assess domains expected to be associated with placebo response. The scale was administered during the screening visit of a 4-week, placebo-controlled study of alprazolam and an investigational compound in 211 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Items that predicted placebo response were identified. Sensitivity and specificity of the instrument were used to determine a threshold score for use in screening likely placebo response. The PRSS was then evaluated by comparing active treatment and placebo groups and subsetting the groups based on subject PRSS scores. Twenty items were selected for being predictive of patient global improvement rating, clinician global improvement rating, or improvement on Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) scores in placebo-arm patients. Receiver operating characteristic concordance values ranged from 0.77 to 0.96 for the different definitions of placebo responder. A cut-score of 50 on a scale of 0-100 was chosen to maximize sensitivity (range 0.67-0.79) and specificity (range 0.78-1.00). Fifty-six patients with scores of 50 or higher were flagged as potential placebo responders. Excluding these 56 patients from the analysis resulted in a greater separation of active treatment from placebo. The PRSS is a promising tool for predicting placebo response in clinical trials and requires further use and validation.",

A total of 24 healthy male volunteers were assigned to one of three parallel herbal treatment groups, each consisting of eight volunteers. A cocktail of probe drugs for CYP enzymes was orally administered before and after multiple administrations of herbal medicines, three times a day for 13 days. Probe drugs used to measure CYP activities were caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1) and midazolam (CYP3A4). The probe drugs and their metabolites were quantified in plasma or urine using HPLC or LC-MS/MS. Changes in each CYP activity was evaluated by metabolic ratio of the probe drug (concentration ratio of metabolite to parent form at reference time point) following the herbal medication period, compared to the baseline values. A. dahuricae radix significantly decreased CYP1A2 activity to 10% of baseline activity (95% CI: 0.05-0.21). S. radix also showed significant changes in CYP2C9 and CYP2E1 activities. Compared to baseline values, the metabolic activities of losartan were decreased to 71% (0.54-0.94). In addition, S. radix showed a 1.42-fold (1.03-1.97) increase in chlorzoxazone metabolic activity. However, CYP activities were not meaningfully influenced by A. tenuissima radix. Changes in certain CYP activities were observed after the administration of S. radix and A. dahuricae radix in healthy volunteers.

    "24": "We previously demonstrated that ciprofloxacin (CPX), a new quinolone antibiotic, suppresses Cyp3a in the mouse liver by reducing the hepatic level of lithocholic acid (LCA) produced by intestinal flora. The present study investigated the possibility that other antibiotics with antibacterial activity against LCA-producing bacteria also cause a decrease in the LCA level in the liver, leading to reduced expression of Cyp3a11. While the mRNA expression of Cyp3a11 in the liver was significantly reduced when SPF mice were administered antibiotics such as ampicillin, CPX, levofloxacin, or a combination of vancomycin and imipenem, no significant changes were observed after antibiotic treatment of GF mice lacking intestinal flora. LCA-producing bacteria in the feces as well as the hepatic level of the taurine conjugate of LCA were significantly reduced in the antibiotic-treated SPF mice, suggesting that the decrease in Cyp3a11 expression can be attributed to the reduction in LCA-producing intestinal flora following antibiotic administration. These results suggest that the administration of antibiotics with activity against LCA-producing bacteria can also cause a decrease in the LCA level in humans, which may lower CYP3A4 expression. The intestinal flora are reported to be altered not only by drugs, such as antibiotics, but also by stress, disease, and age. The findings of the present study suggest that these changes in intestinal flora could modify CYP expression and contribute to the individual differences in pharmacokinetics.",

Semiphysiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were developed for DTZ and MDZ with the major metabolite of DTZ, N-desmethyldiltiazem (nd-DTZ), incorporated in the DTZ model. Enzyme kinetic parameters (k(inact) and K(I)) for DTZ and nd-DTZ were estimated in vitro and used to model the time course of changes in the amount of CYP3A4 in the liver and gut wall, which in turn, determined the nonlinear elimination of MDZ and DTZ, and the corresponding DDI. The robustness of the model prediction was assessed by comparing the results of the prediction to published DTZ pharmacokinetic and DTZ/MDZ interaction data. A clinical study was conducted to further validate the predicted increase of MDZ exposure after DTZ treatment. The model predicted the nonlinear disposition of DTZ after single and multiple oral doses. The clinical study showed that DTZ treatment resulted in 4.1- and 1.6-fold increases in MDZ exposure after oral and intravenous MDZ administration, respectively, suggesting that the DDI in the gut wall plays an important role in the DTZ/MDZ interaction. The semi-PBPK model incorporating the DDI at the gut wall, and the effect of nd-DTZ successfully predicted the nonlinear disposition of DTZ and its interaction with MDZ. Moreover, model simulation suggested that both DTZ and nd-DTZ contributed to the overall inhibitory effect after DTZ administration, and the values of the in vitro estimated inhibition parameters and CYP3A4 turnover rate are critical for the prediction.", 
    "29": "Alcohol tolerance resulting from chronic administration is well known to be accompanied by cross-tolerance to sedative/anesthetic drugs, especially those acting on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs). Rats treated with chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) show decreased function and altered pharmacology of GABAARs in hippocampal neurons, consistent with cell- and location-specific changes in GABAAR subunit composition. We previously observed variably altered sensitivity to GABAergic drugs in vivo and in hippocampal neurons using whole cell patch-clamp recording in brain slices. Here, we examined additional clinical GABAergic drugs to correlate CIE-induced tolerance to potentiation of neuronal GABAAR-mediated currents with tolerance of these agents to sedative/anesthetic effects in vivo. Typical of several drug classes and two cell types, in CA1 pyramidal neurons, the benzodiazepine diazepam doubled the total charge transfer (TCT) of miniature postsynaptic inhibitory currents (mIPSCs), whereas it quadrupled the TCT of tonic currents. CIE treatment altered these responses to variable extent, as it did to loss of righting reflex (LORR) induced by these same drugs: 90-95% tolerance to flurazepam, the neuroactive steroid alphaxalone, and ethanol; 30-40% to pentobarbital, etomidate, and the GABA agonist gaboxadol; and no tolerance to propofol. There was a strong correlation between tolerance in the LORR assay and tolerance to enhancement of tonic currents, but not mIPSCs. The striking correlation suggests that the sedative/anesthetic actions of GABAergic drugs may be mediated primarily via the potentiation of extrasynaptic GABAARs. This requires the reasonable assumption that the same types of GABAARs in other brain regions involved directly in hypnotic drug actions show similar tolerance.",

Initially, the mouse fails to grip with the forepaw ipsilateral to the hemisection but gripping recovers. Additionally, a mouse's gripping by the contralateral paw becomes independent of the sensorimotor cortex, indicating a reorganization of cortical control of gripping function (Blanco, J.E., Anderson, K.D., Steward, O. 2007. Recovery of forepaw gripping ability and reorganization of cortical motor control following cervical spinal cord injuries in mice. Exp. Neurol. 203, 333-348.). Here we explore whether a similar reorganization occurs after cervical hemisection injuries in rats. We show that as in mice, unilateral lesions of the sensorimotor cortex impair rats' griping by the contralateral paw. We also confirm from previous studies that cervical hemisections impair rats' griping by the ipsilateral paw. In contrast to mice, however there is minimal recovery of gripping after complete lateral hemisections and secondary lesions of the sensorimotor cortex continue to impair rats' gripping by the contralateral paw. Thus, forelimb gripping ability as measured by the GSM is dependent on the contralateral sensorimotor cortex in rats even after a cervical hemisection.",

Subjects (n=13) were initially submitted to four habituation trials, followed by four random confrontation sessions for each test (DZP 0, 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg). Each trial was divided into three consecutive 5-min intervals: pre-exposure, exposure (human observer, taxidermized oncilla cat) and post-exposure. As DZP induced sedation, marmosets (n=10) were re-tested in a second experiment, consisting of two habituation trials and four confrontation sessions per stimulus, with lower DZP doses (0, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg). Exposure to both stimuli significantly increased direct gazes and alarm calls, being dose-dependently reduced by DZP only in the PC test. In the HT protocol, the significant decrease in aerial scans was not detected with 0.10 mg/kg DZP. Locomotion, proximity, displacement activities and vigilance were not consistently influenced by the stimuli and/or DZP.

Benzodiazepines appear to selectively reduce anxiety but not fear in this procedure. The primary aim of this experiment was to determine if alcohol produced a similar selective reduction in anxiety. Intoxicated (target blood alcohol concentration of .08%) and nonintoxicated participants viewed a series of colored squares separated by variable intertrial intervals (ITIs) in 3 conditions. In the predictable shock condition, shocks were administered contingently during every square. In the unpredictable shock condition, shocks were administered noncontingently during both squares and ITIs. In the no-shock condition, no shocks were administered at any time. Alcohol significantly reduced startle potentiation during cues signaling unpredictable but not predictable shock, consistent with the thesis that alcohol selectively reduces anxiety but not fear. In addition, alcohol's effect on startle potentiation during unpredictable shock was mediated by vigilance. This anxiolytic effect may clarify the nature of alcohol's reinforcing effects in social and problem drinkers.", 
    "63": "A new configuration of C(18) thin film extraction phase designed for high sample throughput has been developed and applied to the analysis of benzodiazepines in spiked urine samples using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The high throughput analysis was achieved with the use of a robotic autosampler which enabled parallel analyte extraction in a 96-well plate format. Factors affecting data reproducibility, extraction kinetics, sample throughput, and reliability of the system were investigated and optimized. The intrawell reproducibility was 4.5-7.3%, while interwell reproducibility was 7.0-11% in urine and PBS samples. The limits of detection and quantitation were 0.05-0.15 ng/mL and 0.2-2.0 ng/mL for all analytes, respectively. By comparison with optimized automated multifiber SPME relying on rod geometry, the C(18) thin films showed higher extraction rates (approximate 2-fold increase) and hence higher sample throughput because of the improved configuration and more effective agitation/mass transfer. In addition, this new configuration provided an extraction phase with greater surface area to volume ratio and greater extraction phase volume, which resulted in approximately 2-fold increase in the extraction capacity for diazepam compared with the extractions with automated multifiber SPME rod geometry. The results of this investigation demonstrated the advantages of using thin films to improve extraction kinetics and sensitivity of automated SPME methods for high performance liquid chromatography.",

TBI activates numerous cellular mechanisms and molecular cascades that produce detrimental outcomes, including neuronal death and loss of function. The mitochondrion is one of the major targets of TBI, as seen by increased mitochondrial activity in activated and proliferating microglia (due to high energy requirements and/or calcium overload) as well as increased reactive oxygen species, changes in mitochondrial permeability transition, release of cytochrome c, caspase activation, reduced ATP levels, and cell death in neurons. Translocator protein (TSPO) is an 18-kDa outer mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts with the mitochondria permeability transition pore and binds with high affinity to cholesterol and various classes of drug ligands, including some benzodiazepines such as 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864). Although TSPO levels in the brain are low, they are increased after brain injury and inflammation. This finding has led to the proposed use of TSPO expression as a marker of brain injury and repair. TSPO drug ligands have been shown to participate in the control of mitochondrial respiration and function, mitochondrial steroid and neurosteroid formation, as well as apoptosis. This review and commentary will outline our current knowledge of the benefits of targeting TSPO for TBI treatment and the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of TSPO drug ligands in neurotrauma.",

Despite the use of multimodal therapy, the long-term disease-free survival rate of patients with Ewing tumors is still disappointingly low, making the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies all the more necessary. We have recently shown that cholecystokinin (CCK), a neuroendocrine peptide, involved in many biological functions, including cell growth and proliferation, is a relevant target of the EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein characteristic of Ewing tumors. CCK silencing inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that CCK acts as an autocrine growth factor for Ewing cells. Here, we analyzed the impact of two CCK receptor antagonists, devazepide (a CCK1-R antagonist) and L365 260 (a CCK2-R antagonist), on the growth of Ewing tumor cells. Devazepide (10 micromol/l) inhibited cell growth of four different Ewing tumor cells in vitro (range 85-88%), whereas the effect of the CCK2-R antagonist on cell growth was negligible. In a mouse tumor xenograft model, devazepide reduced tumor growth by 40%. Flow cytometry experiments showed that devazepide, but not L365 260, induced apoptosis of Ewing tumor cells. In summary, devazepide induces cell death of Ewing tumor cells, suggesting that it could represent a new therapeutic approach in the management of Ewing's tumor patients.",

In this study, the prediction of clinical DDIs for 30 drugs on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a probe substrate for CYP3A4, was done using in vitro inhibition, inactivation, and induction data. Two DDI prediction approaches were used, which account for effects at both the liver and intestine. The first was a model that simultaneously combines reversible inhibition, time-dependent inactivation, and induction data with static estimates of relevant in vivo concentrations of the precipitant drug to provide point estimates of the average magnitude of change in midazolam exposure. This model yielded a success rate of 88% in discerning DDIs with a mean -fold error of 1.74. The second model was a computational physiologically based pharmacokinetic model that uses dynamic estimates of in vivo concentrations of the precipitant drug and accounts for interindividual variability among the population (Simcyp). This model yielded success rates of 88 and 90% (for \"steady-state\" and \"time-based\" approaches, respectively) and mean -fold errors of 1.59 and 1.47. From these findings it can be concluded that in vivo DDIs for CYP3A4 can be predicted from in vitro data, even when more than one biochemical phenomenon occurs simultaneously.", 
    "99": "Experience can shape cortical circuits, especially during critical periods for plasticity. In visual cortex, imbalance of activity from the two eyes during the critical period shifts ocular dominance (OD) towards the more active eye. Inhibitory circuits are crucial in this process: OD plasticity is absent in GAD65KO mice that show diminished inhibition. This defect can be rescued by application of benzodiazepines, which increase GABAergic signalling. However, it is unknown how such changes in inhibition might disrupt and then restore OD plasticity. Since NMDA dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms are also known to contribute to OD plasticity, we investigated whether NMDA receptor levels and function are also altered in GAD65KO. There are reduced NR2A levels and slower NMDA currents in visual cortex of GAD65KO mice. Application of benzodiazepines, which rescues OD plasticity, also increases NR2A levels. Thus it appears as if OD plasticity can be restored by adding a critical amount of excitatory transmission through NR2A-containing NMDA receptors. Together, these observations can unify competing ideas of how OD plasticity is regulated: changes in either inhibition or excitation would engage homeostatic mechanisms that converge to regulate NMDA receptors, thereby enabling plasticity mechanisms and also ensuring circuit stability.",

Here we have assessed whether the receptor function of the M(1) subtype (CHRM1) is altered in a sub-population of patients with schizophrenia, defined by marked (60-80%) reductions in cortical [3H]-pirenzepine (PZP) binding, and termed 'muscarinic receptor-deficit schizophrenia' (MRDS). Using a [35S]-GTPgammaS-Galpha(q/11) immunocapture method we have assessed whether CHRM1 signalling in human cortex (Brodmann area 9 (BA9)) is altered in post mortem tissue from a MRDS group compared with a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia displaying normal PZP binding, and controls with no known history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. The CHRM agonist (oxotremorine-M) and a CHRM1-selective agonist (AC-42) increased Galpha(q/11)-[35S]-GTPgammaS binding, with AC-42 producing responses that were approximately 50% of those maximally evoked by the full agonist, oxotremorine-M, in control and subgroups of patients with schizophrenia. However, the potency of oxotremorine-M to stimulate Galpha(q/11)-[35S]-GTPgammaS binding was significantly decreased in the MRDS group (pEC(50) (M)=5.69+/-0.16) compared with the control group (6.17+/-0.10) and the non-MRDS group (6.05+/-0.07). The levels of Galpha(q/11) protein present in BA9 did not vary with diagnosis. Maximal oxotremorine-M-stimulated Galpha(q/11)-[35S]-GTPgammaS binding in BA9 membranes was significantly increased in the MRDS group compared with the control group. Similar, though non-statistically significant, trends were observed for AC-42. These data provide evidence that both orthosterically and allosterically acting CHRM agonists can stimulate a receptor-driven functional response ([35S]-GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(q/11)) in membranes prepared from post mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia and controls . Furthermore, in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia displaying markedly decreased PZP binding (MRDS) we have shown that although agonist potency may decrease, the efficacy of CHRM1-Galpha(q/11) coupling increases, suggesting an adaptative change in receptor-G protein coupling efficiency in this endophenotype of patients with schizophrenia.",

PBR transports cholesterol to the mitochondria, where cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is then metabolized to progesterone, an activator of progesterone receptor, and further metabolized to produce allopregnanolone and 3alpha,21-dihydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THDOC), positive allosteric modulators and activators of the GABA(A) receptor. In the present study, we first tested whether the enhanced PBR expression is causally related to neuropathic pain, and we found that the PBR antagonist PK11195 is effective in reducing SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Next we tested whether the PK11195-induced antinociception is attributable to reduced neurosteroid synthesis, which may possibly lead to reduced activation of the progesterone receptor and/or GABA(A) receptor. We found that allopregnanolone and 3alpha,5alpha-THDOC are effective in reducing the anti-hyperalgesic effect of PK11195, suggesting a partial contribution of reduced GABA(A)-receptor activation to PK11195-induced antinociception.",

The noninvasive dual-tracer approach described in this study is based on the primary assumption that an appropriate bolus plus constant infusion protocol brings the reference tissue of the first radiotracer to steady state before injection of the second tracer. Two methods for separation of time-activity curves (TACs) and parameter estimation were investigated, namely (1) an extrapolation method, in which TACs of the first tracer were extrapolated over total scan duration followed by subtraction from dual-tracer TACs and (2) a simultaneous fitting method, in which reference-region models for both tracers were fitted simultaneously to dual-tracer TACs. Combinations of two reversible tracers ([(11)C]flumazenil and [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine) or one reversible and one irreversible tracer ([(11)C]N-methylpiperidinyl propionate) were used. After the dual-tracer scan, a single-tracer (ST) scan using one of the tracers was obtained for comparison of the dual-tracer results.

Since the response of patients to existing medications can be variable and often includes severe side effects, it is critical to increase our knowledge on their mechanism of action to guide clinical usage and new drug development. In this study, we have employed the label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSE) to identify differentially expressed proteins in rat frontal cortex following subchronic treatment with haloperidol or olanzapine. Subcellular fractionation was performed to increased proteomic coverage and provided insight into the subcellular location involved in the mechanism of drug action. LC-MSE profiling identified 531 and 741 annotated proteins in fractions I (cytoplasmic-) and II (membrane enriched-) in two drug treatments. Fifty-nine of these proteins were altered significantly by haloperidol treatment, 74 by olanzapine and 21 were common to both treatments. Pathway analysis revealed that both drugs altered similar classes of proteins associated with cellular assembly/organization, nervous system development/function (particularly presynaptic function) and neurological disorders, which indicate a common mechanism of action. The top affected canonical signaling pathways differed between the two treatments. The haloperidol data set showed a stronger association with Huntington's disease signaling, while olanzapine treatment showed stronger effects on glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. This could either relate to a difference in clinical efficacy or side effect profile of the two compounds. The results were consistent with the findings reported previously by targeted studies, demonstrating the validity of this approach. However, we have also identified many novel proteins which have not been found previously to be associated with these drugs. Further study of these proteins could provide new insights into the etiology of the disease or the mechanism of antipsychotic medications.",

The authors aimed to investigate whether statins have any influence on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme activity. Eleven healthy volunteers were enrolled and evaluated for the effects of statins on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover trial with simvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, and pitavastatin 2 mg. The statins had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its metabolite, 1'-hydroxymidazolam. Furthermore, the area under the concentration-time curve ratios for 1'-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam from 0 to 10 hours showed no significant differences among 3 statins (simvastatin: 0.32 +/- 0.09, atorvastatin: 0.31 +/- 0.09, and pitavastatin: 0.31 +/- 0.12). These data suggest that statins, at least at low doses used in the present study, do not affect CYP3A4 and can be used safely without influencing CAP3A4 enzyme activity.",

    "128": "Progression of severity in experimental status epilepticus (SE), defined as refractoriness to first- and second-line abortive agents, may be related to a five-stage progression of electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. This was tested in the lithium-pilocarpine rat SE model. Abortive treatment with diazepam and phenobarbital was given at EEG stages I, III, and V. In stage I, the combination therapy resulted in 100% SE termination. However, stage III corresponded to high treatment resistance (0% abortion) and stage V to an intermediate response (63%). Comparisons of time-to-treatment durations showed overlap between stage I and stage III, despite having markedly different response rates to abortive medications. Therefore, EEG patterns reflect the dynamic pathophysiology of SE and can be used as reliable and specific markers to distinguish treatment-responsive from treatment-refractory SE more accurately than time alone.",

    "132": "Propofol is a widely used rapidly acting sedating or hypnotic agent in the intensive care setting. It is generally considered safe in both pediatric and adult patients and has been used frequently in cases of refractory status epilepticus. The formulation of propofol is highly lipophilic to facilitate central nervous system penetration and has a high fat content, and prolonged infusions have been known to cause both extrahepatic complications and hepatomegaly secondary to fatty liver. Whereas extrahepatic manifestations of prolonged propofol infusions have been well reported in non-neurologic intensive care patients, cases of pathologically confirmed fatty liver in patients with status epilepticus are relatively few. Furthermore, these cases of hepatomegaly and fatty liver have been also in the context of concomitant extrahepatic side effects. We report on a pediatric patient with refractory status epilepticus treated with a prolonged propofol infusion who developed isolated pathologically confirmed fatty liver without the usually reported extrahepatic manifestations.", 
    "133": "Clavulanic acid is a member of the beta lactam family of antibiotics with little or no intrinsic antibacterial activity of its own; instead, it is used to enhance the activity of antibiotics by blocking bacterial beta-lactamases. Because clavulanic acid by itself is very safe, orally active and shows good brain penetrance, we sought to determine if it had any potential as a psychotherapeutic. Clavulanic acid was a tested across three mammalian species, hamsters, rats and cotton-top tamarin monkeys in a series of behavioral assays designed to screen for anxiolytic activity. In addition, several studies were done in rodents to compare the behavioral profile of clavulanic acid to the commonly prescribed benzodiazepines, particularly with respect to their unwanted side effects of motor depression, amnesia and neuroendocrine dysregulation. Our findings show that clavulanic acid is a highly potent anxiolytic in rodents without altering motor activity in the open field test, normal learning and memory in the Morris water maze, or normal stress hormone release. Orally administered clavulanic acid significantly reduces measures of anxiety in male/female pairs of cotton-top tamarins. In addition, male tamarins showed a highly significant increase in sexual arousal as measured by the number of penile erections. The fact clavulanic acid has anxiolytic activity in the tamarin holds the promise that this drug may be an effective therapeutic for the treatment of anxiety disorders in humans.", 
    "134": "Change in the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors attributable to alterations in receptor subunit composition is one of main molecular mechanisms with those affecting the glutamatergic system which accompany prolonged alcohol (ethanol) intake. These changes explain in part the central nervous system hyperexcitability consequently to ethanol administration cessation. Hyperexcitability associated with ethanol withdrawal is expressed by physical signs, such as tremors, convulsions, and heightened anxiety in animal models as well as in humans. The present work investigated the effects of anxiolytic compound etifoxine on ethanol-withdrawal paradigms in a mouse model. The benzodiazepine diazepam was chosen as reference compound. Ethanol was given to NMRI mice by a liquid diet at 3% for 8 days, then at 4% for 7 days. Under these conditions, ethanol blood level ranged between 0.5 and 2 g/L for a daily ethanol intake varying from 24 to 30 g/kg. These parameters permitted the emergence of ethanol-withdrawal symptoms once ethanol administration was terminated. Etifoxine (12.5-25 mg/kg) and diazepam (1-4 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally 3h 30 min after ethanol removal, decreased the severity in handling-induced tremors and convulsions in the period of 4-6h after withdrawal from chronic ethanol treatment. In addition when administered at 30 and 15 min, respectively, before the light and dark box test, etifoxine (50mg/kg) and diazepam (1mg/kg) inhibited enhanced aversive response 8h after ethanol withdrawal. Etifoxine at 25 and 50 mg/kg doses was without effects on spontaneous locomotor activity and did not exhibit ataxic effects on the rota rod in animals not treated with ethanol. These findings demonstrate that the GABAergic compound etifoxine selectively reduces the physical signs and anxiety-like behavior associated with ethanol withdrawal in a mouse model and may hold promise in the treatment of ethanol-withdrawal syndrome in humans.",

A case-control study was conducted among drivers in Bangkok, Thailand. Two hundred cases and 849 controls were enrolled between February and November 2006. Cases who sustained a RTI were matched with four controls recruited from petrol stations within a 1-km radius of the reported crash site of the case. A positive alcohol breath test (> or =50mg/dl), and positive tests for the presence of illicit (amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana) and non-illicit psychoactive drugs (antihistamine, benzodiazepine, antidepressants), using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were documented as primary measures. There were significantly higher odds of an alcohol breath test > or =50mg/dl (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 63.6 (95% CI: 25.5-158.9)), illicit psychoactive drugs (adjusted OR 3.4 (95% CI: 1.7-6.6)) and non-illicit psychoactive drug (adjusted OR 3.1 (95% CI: 1.5-6.3)) among cases than controls. Even though driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs has been significantly linked to RTI, its contribution to road safety is much lower than driving under the influence of alcohol. With limited resources, the priority for RTI prevention should be given to control of driving under the influence of alcohol.",

One thousand six hundred and thirty-five motor vehicle drivers were randomly selected from five geographical regions of Thailand between December 2005 and May 2006. The prevalence of psychoactive drugs was determined using urine tests by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Among 1635 drivers, 5.5% were tested positive for breath alcohol with 2% having a level exceeding the legal limit (> or =50mg%).

    "145": "We have characterized earlier the long-term behavioural, electroencephalographic and histopatologic features after a single TsTx microinjection, consisting of a neuropeptide isolated from the Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, into the hippocampus of rats. TsTx was able to induce status epilepticus (SE) and developed later epilepsy. The present study was designed to investigate the outcomes of diazepam plus pentobarbital administered at 30 min, 1, 2 or 6h after the beginning of TsTx-induced SE, on the development of spontaneous recurrent motor seizures (SRMSs), mossy fibre sprouting and hippocampal neurodegeneration in rats. The administration of diazepam (DZ)+pentobarbital (PB) 30 min after the beginning of the TsTx-induced SE was able to markedly reduce the frequency of the SRMSs and prevent the development of mossy fibres sprouting and hippocampal lesion. In the other groups the augment of the extent of hipocampal neurodegeneration, the frequency of SRMSs and degree of aberrant mossy fibre sprouting was directly proportional to the time that the animals were subjected to TsTx-induced SE. In conclusion, our results point out that the early blockade of the TsTx-induced SE with diazepam plus pentobarbital, was effective treatment against later epilepsy development. The effectiveness of this treatment depends on the time that the animals were subjected to the SE. Furthermore, the TsTx model could be a useful tool to study antiepileptogenic drugs in chronic epileptic animals, neuronal degeneration, as well as for the mechanisms underlying epilepsy.", 
    "146": "Histone modification, which affects the rate of transcription without altering DNA sequence, occurs in response to various psychiatric drugs and in several models of psychiatric disease. As increases in histone acetylation have been seen after treatment with antidepressants, we investigated whether directly increasing histone acetylation using a histone deacetylase inhibitor would have antidepressant effects. We administered sodium butyrate (NaB, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) to mice acutely (3 injections over 24 h) or chronically (twice daily for 21 days) and subjected them to a number of behavioral tests of antidepressant response. This dose of NaB had no effect on overall locomotor activity after either acute or chronic treatment. Acutely treated mice showed an increase in immobility in the forced-swim test (FST) and an increase in latency to consume in the novel environment of the novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) paradigm, an anxiogenic effect. The effect of NaB on anxiety did not generalize to another test, the elevated zero maze, where it had no effect. Chronic treatment with NaB had no effect on latency to consume in the NIH or immobility in the FST. However, this dose did alter histone acetylation in the hippocampus. While H4 acetylation increased in the hippocampus 30 min following acute NaB, chronic treatment caused a decrease in AcH4. There were no changes in AcH3 following either treatment. While changes in chromatin structure may be involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs, these data suggest that increasing histone acetylation pharmacologically is not sufficient to produce antidepressant effects.",

Specifically, benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 and protoporphyrin IX showed 5-13-fold lower affinity for duodenal TSPO. The mRNA and protein ratios of TSPO to other mitochondrial membrane proteins VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) and ANT (adenine nucleotide transporter) were significantly different.

The main treatment options of single vision spectacle lenses, contact lenses, and refractive surgery do not slow the accompanying eye growth or retard the physiological changes associated with excessive axial elongation. High myopia is a predisposing factor for retinal detachment, myopic retinopathy, and glaucoma, contributing to loss of vision and blindness. The high prevalence of myopia and its prominence as a public health problem emphasize the importance of finding effective treatments that slow myopia progression and axial elongation. Treatments that have been investigated include various types of spectacle lenses and contact lenses, as well as pharmaceutical agents such as atropine and pirenzepine. The bulk of evidence from well-conducted studies shows that overall, most therapies for myopia have small treatment benefits that last for a relatively short period of time or have significant side effects. Some therapies may be more effective in subsets of myopic children. This review of treatment options for myopia will emphasize recent results from well-designed clinical studies and will suggest possible future therapies.", 
    "155": "Numerous methodological-related variables have been demonstrated to influence the baseline anxiety level of rodents exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM), raising questions about the sensitivity of this test for the detection of the effects of anxiolytic drugs. Thus, the present study was designed (1) to assess the combined effects of illumination (40-lx red or white light), closed wall type (walls made of translucent or opaque material) and extramaze space size (small or spacious experimental room) on rat behaviour, and (2) to investigate the effects of such parameters on the relevance of the maze for detecting the effects of diazepam orally administrated at the anxiolytic dose of 3 mg/kg. Results indicate that illumination and closed wall type are two main independent parameters that are able to modify the open arm avoidance. Moreover, the closed wall type interacts with the extramaze space size since the reduction of the open arm exploration induced by opaque closed walls is two-fold stronger in the spacious experimental room than in the small one. Finally, the diazepam anxiolytic activity is significantly detected in our laboratory in specific EPM conditions (maze with opaque walls, use of a red light, maze located in a spacious experimental room). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that an inappropriate baseline anxiety level due to the methodological use of the EPM can dramatically reduce the sensitivity of the maze for the detection of benzodiazepine-related compounds. This study also provides new insights into the perception of the EPM open space in rats.",

    "164": "Benzodiazepine users were found to be at a significantly increased risk of MVCs compared to nonusers, and these differences may be accounted for by a difficulty in maintaining road position.", 
    "165": "Zinc is released in synaptic vesicles with glutamate, and modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission. In brain, the highest amount of zinc, detected by Timm staining, is in the mossy fiber (MF) system in the hippocampus. In the intrahippocampal kainate (KA) mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, which is elicited by intrahippocampal KA, prominent MF sprouting develops rapidly within 2 weeks post-KA. However, the intensity of Timm staining is reduced gradually thereafter. The present study is designed to determine the mechanisms underlying this reduction of Timm staining.", 
    "166": "The changes in Timm staining, and VGluT1, Synapsin-1, and zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) immunoreactivity (IR) were examined from 4-56 days post-KA. An analysis of glutamate release in the KA-injected hippocampus was conducted by microdialysis before and during the continuous injection of midazolam (MDZ).", 
    "167": "At 56 days post-KA, Timm staining disappeared completely, whereas VGluT-1-, Synapsin-1-, and ZnT3-IR were increased in the sprouted MF boutons. However, when the seizures were suppressed by a continuous perfusion of MDZ, the glutamate release in the hippocampus decreased and Timm staining was recovered.", 
    "168": "This study showed that the reduction of Timm staining is the result of decreased zinc content but not the loss of MF itself. The reduction is the result of the enhanced release of zinc relative to storage, and it should facilitate the glutamate excitation that might be related to the epileptogenesis and rapid advancement of the morphologic changes in this model.", 
    "169": "Eleven years after a brief visit to some European countries, a 48-year-old Japanese man developed writing difficulty, irritability and general fatigue. Then he complained of dysesthetic pains in his legs, for which benzodiazepines were prescribed. However, at the time pulvinar sign was retrospectively confirmed on brain MRI. Eighteen months after the onset, his gait became ataxic with rapid deterioration of mental status over the following several months. Thirty-one months after the onset, he became akinetic and mute with periodic synchronous discharges on EEG, and died at the age of 51. The total clinical course was approximately 43 months. Pathological examination revealed the characteristic alterations of spongiform encephalopathy, severe in the thalamus, moderate but widely spread in the cerebral cortices, and moderate in the cerebellum. Abundant amyloid plaques were easily identified in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum on HE staining. Immunohistochemistry for abnormal prion protein (PrP(sc)) confirmed amyloid plaques in several forms, such as florid, uni- and multi-centric plaques as well as perineuronal and periaxonal deposits in the basal ganglia and synaptic patterns in the thalami. A Western blotting study identified type 2B protease-resistant PrP. This is the first Japanese patient who was definitely diagnosed as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The pathological findings were similar to those of previous reports of vCJD in the UK. However, the changes were much more severe both in degree and distribution, probably due to a longer duration of the illness than those in the UK.",

    "172": "The authors conducted a retrospective nonconcurrent cohort study of all patients seen in an adult ED between April 19, 2005, and April 18, 2007, who were discharged with a prescription. Prior to April 19, 2006, a specialized prescription form stored in a locked cabinet was obtained from the nursing staff to write a prescription for benzodiazepines or Schedule II opioids. After April 19, 2006, New York State mandated that all prescriptions, regardless of schedule classification, be generated on a specialized bar-coded prescription form. The main outcome of the study was to compare the proportion of Schedule III-V opioids to Schedule II opioids and benzodiazepines prescribed in the ED before and after the introduction of a less cumbersome prescription writing process.", 
    "173": "Of the 26,638 charts reviewed, 2.1% of the total number of prescriptions generated were for a Schedule II controlled opioid before the new system was implemented compared to 13.6% after (odds ratio [OR] = 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.4 to 8.4). The corresponding percentages for Schedule III-V opioids were 29.9% to 18.1% (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.55) and for benzodiazepines 1.4% to 3.9% (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 2.4 to 3.4).",

    "175": "Patients who await surgery often suffer from fear and anxiety, which can be prevented by anxiolytic drugs. Relaxing music may be an alternative treatment with fewer adverse effects. This randomised clinical trial compared pre-operative midazolam with relaxing music.", 
    "176": "Three hundred and seventy-two patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomised to receive pre-operative prevention of anxiety by 0.05-0.1 mg/kg of midazolam orally or by relaxing music. The main outcome measure was the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI X-1), which was completed by the patients just before and after the intervention.", 
    "177": "Of the 177 patients who completed the music protocol, the mean and (standard deviation) STAI-state anxiety scores were 34 (8) before and 30 (7) after the intervention. The corresponding scores for the 150 patients in the midazolam group were 36 (8) before and 34 (7) after the intervention. The decline in the STAI-state anxiety score was significantly greater in the music group compared with the midazolam group (P<0.001, 95% confidence interval range -3.8 to -1.8).", 
    "178": "Relaxing music decreases the level of anxiety in a pre-operative setting to a greater extent than orally administrated midazolam. Higher effectiveness and absence of apparent adverse effects makes pre-operative relaxing music a useful alternative to midazolam for pre-medication.",

    "180": "Patients were randomized to receive a cherry-flavoredscent in oxygen flowing at a 4 L per minute rate via nasal cannula or oxygen alone. The scent was provided in a cherry-flavored oil. A Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) was placed and scores were recorded every 5 minutes during the procedure to control for different sedation patterns between different endoscopists. The recovery area nurse was unaware of whether a given patient was in the aroma or plain oxygen group, and based each patient's discharge on preexisting standardized criteria.", 
    "181": "Two hundred and eighty-four (284) patients completed the study. Both the procedure times and the recovery times were not statistically significant between the two groups. The doses of sedatives used, BIS scores at 5 minute intervals, and rate of change in BIS scores were also not statistically significant between the two groups.",

    "183": "Epilepsy affects the menstrual cycle, aspects of contraception, fertility, pregnancy and bone health in women. It is common for seizure frequency to vary throughout the menstrual cycle. In ovulatory cycles, two peaks can be seen around the time of ovulation and in the few days before menstruation. In anovulatory cycles, there is an increase in seizures during the second half of the menstrual cycle. There is also an increase in polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism associated with valproate therapy. There are no contraindications to the use of non-hormonal methods of contraception in women with epilepsy. Non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) [valproate, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, tiagabine and zonisamide] do not show any interactions with the combined oral contraceptive (OC). There are interactions between the combined OC and hepatic microsomal-inducing AEDs (phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, topiramate [dosages>200 mg/day], oxcarbazepine) and lamotrigine. Pre-conception counselling should be available to all women with epilepsy who are considering pregnancy. Women with epilepsy should be informed about issues relating to the future pregnancy, including methods and consequences of prenatal screening, fertility, genetics of their seizure disorder, teratogenicity of AEDs, folic acid and vitamin K supplements, labour, breast feeding and care of a child. During pregnancy, the lowest effective dose of the most appropriate AED should be used, aiming for monotherapy where possible. Recent pregnancy databases have suggested that valproate is significantly more teratogenic than carbamazepine, and the combination of valproate and lamotrigine is particularly teratogenic. Most pregnancies in women with epilepsy are without complications, and the majority of infants are delivered healthy with no increased risk of obstetric complications in women. There is no medical reason why a woman with epilepsy cannot breastfeed her child. The AED concentration profiled in breast milk follows the plasma concentration curve. The total amount of drug transferred to infants via breast milk is usually much smaller than the amount transferred via the placenta during pregnancy. However, as drug elimination mechanisms are not fully developed in early infancy, repeated administration of a drug such as lamotrigine via breast milk may lead to accumulation in the infant. Studies have suggested that women with epilepsy are at increased risk of fractures, osteoporosis and osteomalacia. No studies have been undertaken looking at preventative therapies for these co-morbidities.", 
    "184": "In our screening of Indonesian microorganisms for novel bioactive natural products we have isolated seven new compounds, designated as limazepines A, B1 and B2 (isolated as an isomeric mixture), C, D, E, and F, from the culture broth of Micrococcus sp. strain ICBB 8177. In addition, the known natural products prothracarcin and 7-O-succinylmacrolactin A, as well as two previously reported synthetic compounds, 2-amino-3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid methyl ester and 4-ethylpyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde, were obtained from the extract. Chemical structures were determined by spectroscopic methods and by comparison with the NMR data of structurally related compounds. The limazepines belong to the growing group of the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine antitumor antibiotics isolated from various soil bacteria. Limazepines B1/B2 mixture, C, and E were active against the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Limazepine D was also active against S. aureus, but was not active against E. coli. Interestingly, only the limazepines B1/B2 mixture and D were active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", 
    "185": "Lamotrigine (LTG), a diaminotriazine anti-epileptic, is principally metabolized at the 2-position of the triazine ring to form a quaternary ammonium glucuronide (LTGG) by uridine glucuronosyl transferease (UGT) 1A3 and UGT1A4. It has been hypothesized that glucuronidation of anti-epileptic drugs is spared with age, despite a known decrease in liver mass, based on older studies with benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. To examine this, the formation rates of LTGG formation were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in a bank of human liver microsomes (HLMs) obtained from younger and elderly donors at therapeutic concentrations. The formation rate of LTGG was not significantly different in HLMs obtained from younger and elderly subjects. A four- to five-fold variation for the formation of LTGG was observed within each microsomal bank obtained from elderly and younger donors, and the range of LTGG formation was observed to be 0.15-0.78 nmoles min(-1) mg(-1) of protein across the entire set of HLMs (n = 36, elderly and younger HLMs). UGT1A4 and UGT1A3 catalysed the formation of LTGG with an intrinsic clearances of 0.28 and 0.02 microl min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. UGT2B7 and UGT2B4 showed no measurable activity. No correlation was observed across the HLM bank for glucuronidation of LTG and valproic acid (a substrate for multiple UGT isoforms including UGT1A4).", 
    "186": "The amygdala formation is implicated in generation of emotional states such as anxiety and fear. Many substances that modulate neuronal activity in the amygdala alter anxiety. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an endogenous neuropeptide that induces anxiety states in behavioral studies in both animals and humans. Using a brain slice preparation, we found that application of CCK increases inhibitory synaptic transmission measured in projection neurons of the basolateral amygdala. To determine the source of the increased inhibition we examined the direct effect of CCK on local interneurons in this region. CCK most strongly depolarized fast-spiking interneurons. Burst-firing and regular-firing interneurons were also depolarized, although to a lesser degree. However, another distinct group of interneurons was unaffected by CCK. These effects were mediated by the CCKB receptor subtype. The excitatory effect of CCK appeared to be mediated by both a nonselective cation and a K+ current.", 
    "187": "Translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is an 18-kDa drug- and cholesterol-binding protein localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and implicated in a variety of cell and mitochondrial functions. To determine the role of TSPO in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), we used both in vivo and in vitro porcine models: an in vivo renal ischemia model where different conservation modalities were tested and an in vitro model where TSPO-transfected porcine proximal tubule LLC-PK(1) cells were exposed to hypoxia and oxidative stress. The expression of TSPO and its partners in steroidogenic cells, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P-450 side chain cleavage CYP11A1, as well as the impact of TSPO overexpression and exposure to TSPO ligands in vitro in hypoxia-ischemia conditions were investigated. Hypoxia induced caspase activation, reduction of ATP content, and LLC-PK(1) cell death. Transfection and overexpression of TSPO rescued the cells from the detrimental effects of hypoxia and reoxygenation. Moreover, TSPO overexpression was accompanied by a reduction of H(2)O(2)-induced necrosis. TSPO drug ligands did not affect TSPO-mediated functions. In vivo, TSPO expression was modulated by IRI and during regeneration particularly in proximal tubule cells, which do not express this protein at the basal level. Under the same conditions, StAR and CYP11A1 protein and gene expression was reduced without apparent relation to TSPO changes. Pregnenolone was identified and measured in the pig kidney. Pregnenolone synthesis was not affected by the experimental conditions used. Taken together, these results indicate that changes in TSPO expression in kidney regenerating tissue could be important for renal protection and maintenance of kidney function.", 
    "188": "Combined sedation with a benzodiazepine and an opiate has been proposed as standard sedation for bronchoscopy. Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic with a rapid onset of action and fast recovery time, but carries the potential risk of respiratory failure. Consecutive patients (n = 200) were randomly allocated to receive either the combination midazolam and hydrocodone or intravenous propofol. The primary end-points were the mean lowest arterial oxygen saturation during bronchoscopy and the readiness-for-discharge score 1 h after the procedure. The mean lowest arterial oxygen saturation during bronchoscopy did not differ across treatment groups (p = 0.422), and the number of patients recording an arterial oxygen saturation of < or =90% on at least one occasion was similar in both groups (p = 0.273). The median (interquartile range) readiness-for-discharge score 1 h after the procedure was significantly higher in the propofol group than in the combined sedation group (8 (6-9) versus 7 (5-9); p = 0.035). Patients assigned propofol exhibited less tachycardia during bronchoscopy and for > or =1 h after the examination. Minor procedural complications were noted in 71 (35.5%) patients and exhibited a similar incidence in both treatment arms (p = 0.460). Propofol is as effective and safe as combined sedation in patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, thus representing an appealing option if timely discharge is a priority.", 
    "189": "In our previous study we suggested that multivariate analysis could improve hole-board test reliability providing a more useful tool to determine behavioral effects of anxiolytic drugs. To support this hypothesis, a multivariate analysis of rat behavior in hole-board, following administration of the reference anxiolytic drug diazepam, was carried out. Four groups, each composed of thirty male Wistar rats, were used: one saline and three diazepam injected (0.25, 0.5 and 2 mg/kg IP). Rat behavior was recorded for 10 min through a digital videocamera. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were carried out. In all groups, more than 80% of whole behavioral structure encompassed walking, climbing, rearing, immobile-sniffing, edge-sniff and head-dip. Moreover, modifications observed of a specific index, represented by edge-sniff/head-dip ratio, were correlated to diazepam-induced modifications of anxiety level. Cluster analysis showed that diazepam at 0.5 and 2 mg/kg induced important changes for [edge-sniff/head-dip] cluster. In addition, in all diazepam groups a [walking/climbing] cluster appeared. Path diagrams showed close relationships among different patterns both in saline and diazepam injected animals. Also, significant changes were detected following diazepam for transitions encompassing both general exploratory patterns (walking, climbing) and the specific ones (head-dip and edge-sniff). Adjusted residuals confirmed in all groups patterns relationships and, where present, significant behavioral associations. Results demonstrate that an anxiolytic activity can be revealed by head-dip/edge-sniff association weakening and by the addressing of behavioral structure toward general exploratory activity. Improvement of hole-board test reliability in behavioral study of anxiety, following multivariate analysis, is emphasized.",

Because of the resulting respiratory depression the patient had to be intubated. To cope with myoclonies and other symptoms of substance withdrawal we had to administer midazolame and clonidine continuously until day four. Because of acute renal failure resulting from rhabdomyolysis hemodialysis was necessary three times. After 19 days the patient was transferred to a psychiatric clinic.",

The fish liver samples were extracted and cleaned up by using liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction before the extracts were analyzed by LC/MS or LC/MS/MS with electrospray negative and positive ionization. Recoveries of the 5 target compounds from spiked catfish liver ranged from 72 +/- 2 to 100 +/- 3%. Limits of quantification for the 5 compounds were between 4.2 and 12.3 ng/g (wet weight). Ten turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) liver samples were analyzed; levels of 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, carbamazepine, simvastatin, and oxybenzone were below the detection limits. Diazepam was detected in all 10 fish liver samples at concentrations ranging from 23 to 110 ng/g (wet weight).", 
    "195": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has a lifetime prevalence in the US population of about 5.7%. Typically, GAD begins in early adulthood and tends to have a chronic and persistent course. The disorder frequently presents comorbidly with other conditions, and about 90% of patients with GAD have at least 1 comorbid lifetime psychiatric disorder. Patients with GAD tend to be high users of medical services; the disorder is associated with significant physical as well as psychological symptomatology and impacts health, family relationships, and employment. Pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments are available for GAD. Different side effect profiles, speed of onset of action, and discontinuation requirements of individual drugs need to be taken into account when selecting treatment. Treatment selection should include consideration of comorbidity, psychological function, social impairment, and refractoriness, as well as the need for ongoing intervention for many individuals. Innovative treatments, including anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and others, as well as treatment targeting concomitant insomnia, may help improve outcomes for affected individuals.", 
    "196": "Many patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) do not receive adequate treatment. Several classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines, azapirones, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, antihistamines, alpha(2)delta Ca++ channel modulators, and atypical antipsychotics are consistently beneficial in patients with GAD. Cognitive therapy is also effective as a first-line treatment. When individualizing treatment, drug dose ranges and side effect profiles need to be considered, as well as the patient's comorbid conditions. Doses may need to be reduced for elderly or medically ill patients or those taking other medications. Doses may need to be increased for refractory cases. Common comorbid conditions with GAD include depression, alcohol or drug abuse, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. In patients with significant depression, an antidepressant is more likely to succeed than a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. Remission is attainable but can take several months, and stopping medication increases the risk of relapse within the first year of initiating treatment.", 
    "197": "The objective of this study was to examine the predictors associated with adherence to atypical antipsychotic medication following discharge from hospital for children and adolescents with first-episode psychosis. Sixty-five children and adolescents, age 15.35 +/- 2.08 years, 59% boys, who had participated in a longitudinal cohort study examining relapse following first hospitalization for episode of psychosis were included in this study. All those studied were discharged on one of three atypical antipsychotics, risperidone, quetiapine, or olanzapine between January 1999 and October 2003. Time 1 data were collected retrospectively from medical charts using a standardized questionnaire; time 2 data were obtained using questionnaire mailed to participants' parents a minimum of 2 years post-discharge, mean 3.9 +/- 1.3 years. Variables examined as predictors of adherence fell into broad categories of biological, social and treatment variables. Discharge on concurrent pharmacologic agent for affective symptoms in addition to atypical antipsychotic, OR = 10.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.06-53.19] was a strong predictor of medication adherence in adolescents. The results indicated that children and adolescents discharged from their first hospitalization following a psychotic episode may be more likely to stay on prescribed antipsychotic medication if they are prescribed concurrent medication for affective symptoms.",

Although it is well recognized in the context of conventional antipsychotic medications, there have been recent concerns raised by clinicians and researchers that this syndrome is overlooked in relation to second-generation or atypical antipsychotics. This review examines the recent literature relevant to second-generation antipsychotic (SGA)-induced akathisia.", 
    "209": "Recent studies using large databases clearly indicate that extrapyramidal side effects, in particular akathisia, do occur with the SGAs, although the frequency is not as high as with the conventional antipsychotics. Risk factors include use of high doses, high potency SGAs, or combinations of SGAs with other psychotropic drugs, bipolar depression, palliative care settings, and comorbid substance abuse in psychosis. The dopamine hypothesis remains plausible for understanding the pathophysiology of akathisia. There is emerging evidence that mirtazapine may be useful in the treatment of acute akathisia.",

    "211": "The use of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) in screening of decomposed bone tissue for model drugs of abuse is described. Rats received 50 mg/kg (i.p.) pentobarbital (n=2), 75 mg/kg (i.p.) ketamine (n=2) or 16 mg/kg (i.p.) diazepam (n=1), or remained drug-free (control). Drug-positive animals were euthanized within 20 min of drug administration. Animal remains were allowed to decompose in a secure outdoor environment to the point of complete skeletonization. Bones (tibiae, femora, vertebrae, ribs, pelvi, humeri and scapulae) were collected and pooled (according to drug) in order to minimize effects due to inter-bone differences in drug distribution. Bones were crushed and cleaned of marrow and residual soft tissue in alkaline solution or phosphate buffer with ultrasonication. Cleaned bones were then ground and underwent MAE in phosphate buffer (pH 6), methanol or a methanol:water mixture (1:1, v/v) at atmospheric pressure in a domestic microwave oven, or passive extraction in methanol. Bone extracts (control and drug-exposed) containing methanol were evaporated to dryness before reconstitution in phosphate buffer (pH 6) and subsequent analysis by ELISA, while bone extracts containing only phosphate buffer were assayed directly by the same ELISA protocol. Measured absorbance values were expressed as the decrease in absorbance, measured as a percentage, relative to the corresponding drug-free control bone extract. The semi-quantitative nature of the ELISA assay allowed examination of the effects of extraction solvent and bone sample mass on the assay response for each drug examined, and subsequent comparison to assays of extracts obtained through passive methanolic extraction of various bone tissues. Overall, the time required for maximal extraction varied with extraction solvent and bone mass for each drug investigated, with significant extraction occurring with all solvent systems examined. MAE may represent a substantially faster extraction system than passive extraction, with significant extraction recovery observed within 1 min of exposure for all samples examined. The implications of these results in the context of the available literature on drug analysis in skeletal tissues are discussed.", 
    "212": "Stress exposure activates the autonomic nervous system and leads to a body temperature increase (stress-induced hyperthermia, SIH). On the other hand, an activation of the immune system in response to an infection leads to fever. Both processes increase body temperature, and the relation between SIH and infection-induced fever has been subject to debate. It is not clear whether SIH is a form of fever, or whether both processes are more or less distinct. We therefore examined the relation between SIH and infection-induced fever by looking at the effects of a GABA(A) receptor agonist (diazepam) and a prostaglandin-synthesis blocking drug (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin) on both the SIH response and fever in rats and mice. The present study shows that the benzodiazepine diazepam but not the prostaglandin-synthesis blocking drug aspirin dose-dependently attenuated the SIH response in both rats and mice. In contrast, aspirin reduced both LPS- and IL-1beta induced fever, whereas diazepam had little effect on these fever states. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis that stress-induced hyperthermia and infection-induced fever are two distinct processes mediated largely by different neurobiological mechanisms.", 
    "213": "The basic mechanisms of hippocampal networks in epileptogenesis are not entirely understood. To help achieve a better understanding of these mechanisms, we studied the extra-cellular electrically evoked responses in the hippocampi of mice during rapid kindling. Kindling protocol was achieved by stimulating the dorsal right hippocampus six times daily for four days using bipolar electrodes to produce sub-convulsive electrical discharges. Motor responses and analyzed electroencephalographic recordings showed progression from partial complex seizures to generalized seizures associated with different consecutive patterns within the afterdischarges. A spike-wave pattern appeared immediately after stimulation in combination with a poly-spike complex superimposed over the wave (AD1). AD1 was followed by a poly-spike complex (AD2), which was followed by a progressive modification of repetitive spikes (AD3). An ictal depression event was observed at the end of each AD3. Theta oscillations were observed at stage 1-2 of kindling, while beta/gamma oscillations appeared within AD2, associated with stage 4-5 from Racine's score. Benzodiazepine, a GABA (A) agonist (Diazepam) administered at non-sedative doses and only on days 3 and 4 of kindling, limited beta and gamma frequency bands and the progression of seizure severity, suggesting that the failure of GABA (A) agonism mediates the propagation or generalization of seizures. We conclude that different phases of afterdischarge occur during kindling and that high frequencies mediate generalization of seizures.",

It is in order to evaluate these conjugates as delivery systems of PBR ligands endowed with apoptosis inducing activity. Various coupling reaction conditions were tested to optimize the conjugation process. After purification by extensive dialysis procedures, the macromolecular conjugates were characterized by FT-IR, UV, (1)H NMR spectroscopy, DSC and the average molecular weights of synthesized conjugates were determined by GPC. PBR ligand released from these conjugates occurred in human serum and in 0.1 N HCl solution at a faster rate than that observed in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Moreover, the macromolecular conjugates displayed high affinity and selectivity for PBR. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that PBR ligand-PLGA polymer conjugates induce survival inhibition in rat C6 glioma cell line. Fluorescence microscopy studies evidenced the cellular uptake of FITC-conjugated probes 10 and 11 and moreover, the mitochondrial morphology modification induced by compounds 1 and 4a. Therefore, this study demonstrates that this PBR ligand-PLGA combination may provide a new mitochondrial targeted approach useful for improved cancer chemotherapy.",

According to TDR/WHO, existing leads with proven schistosomicidal activity, like meclonazepam, might be the objects of further exploration. Here, we decided to investigate if the benzodiazepine binding sites that we recently characterized in adult Schistosoma mansoni could represent the molecular target of meclonazepam for its effect on worm motility and morphological appearance. The EC(50) of meclonazepam for its contracturant effect is 10-20 times lower than its IC(50) for binding to the worm benzodiazepine binding sites. On the contrary, benzodiazepines like flunitrazepam and diazepam have affinities at least 50 times higher than meclonazepam for these binding sites but did not induce contraction of the worms. We also confirmed the existence of a great similarity between the appearance, kinetics, Emax and external calcium dependency of the contractile effect of praziquantel and meclonazepam. Based on computer-aided molecular modeling calculations, we verified that a certain structural similarity exists between the active enantiomers of both drugs. We further proposed the hypothesis of common pharmacophoric elements including amide and imine subunits and the asymmetric carbons of S-(+)-meclozepam and R-(-)-praziquantel. As a whole, the present data indicate that the contracturant effect of meclonazepam is not a result of its binding to the worm benzodiazepine binding sites but that it shares some basic transduction pathway with praziquantel, even if not through identical molecular targets or binding sites."
