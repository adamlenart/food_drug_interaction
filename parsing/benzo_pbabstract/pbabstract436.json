    "0": "In this longitudinal study of patterns of use of psychotropic drugs by a cohort of elderly nursing home residents (N = 5,752), drug use was examined upon admission, 3 months later, and at discharge/end of study. At each time point, 17% of the cohort used neuroleptics. Half of the subjects discontinued neuroleptics at each time point; however, a similar number were initiated on the drug. Benzodiazepines were used by 21%, 15%, and 15% at each of the three time points, respectively. Twice as many people were taken off benzodiazepines as initiated on them following admission. The 5% rate of antidepressant use was constant across the three time periods, although only half of those who took antidepressants upon admission were also taking them upon discharge/end of study. The amount of change due to discontinuation of these drugs and adjustment in dosage levels challenges the stereotype of the \"neglected psychotropic drug user\" in nursing homes.", 
    "1": "Many anxiety disorder patients who present for behaviour therapy are already taking anxiolytic medications. The present study added a new subscale to the Mobility Inventory labelled 'Without Medication' to assess possible reliance on medication for coping with phobic situations. 121 Patients with panic-related disorders were administered the scale. The results supported the reliability and validity of the existing Mobility Inventory subscales in general and of the new subscale in particular. It appears to reliably assess a clinically important domain that is not measured in traditional self-report measures of phobic avoidance.", 
    "2": "A systematic study of the effects of convulsants acting at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex was undertaken in mice to estimate their potential anxiogenic effects and/or performance enhancing effects in learning and memory tasks. Anxiogenic effects were assessed in a conflict task where lever presses delivered both a food pellet and a mild electric foot shock. Effects on learning were assessed through analysis of habituation to a new environment. The convulsant agents pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and picrotoxin (PX), both acting through the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, and strychnine, a convulsant acting through the glycine transmission were used. Our data show that non convulsive doses of PTZ (25 mg/kg) and PX (0.85 mg/kg), but not of strychnine (0.8 mg/kg), are anxiogenic in the conflict model. At lower doses PTZ (10 mg/kg) and PX (0.3 mg/kg), but not strychnine (0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg), enhance performance in the habituation model. Our results contribute to the validation of the idea that small decreases in GABAergic transmission are accompanied by improvement of learning whereas medium decreases induce anxiogenic effects.", 
    "3": "From July 1, 1990 to June 30, 1991, 55 adult patients with acute alteration of mental status of unknown etiology were enrolled into this study in order to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic role of flumazenil in the management of this disorder. Patients who were pregnant or had severe head injury, hemodynamic instability or a provisional diagnosis of hypoglycemia, meningitis or acute cerebrovascular event were excluded. Flumazenil was injected intravenously first in a regimen of 0.3 mg followed by alternative 0.2 mg and 0.3 mg doses every minute until a total dose of 1 mg was given or until the patients responded. These patients were divided into 2 groups based on their response to flumazenil: Group 1, responders (N = 26) and Group 2, nonresponders (N = 29). Good response in Group 1 allowed the cancellation or discontinuation of brain CT scan in 18 patients; intubation and artificial ventilation in 2 and vasopressor infusion in one. The hospital stay was shortened significantly as compared with historical information in uncomplicated benzodiazepine intoxication patients who were admitted before flumazenil was introduced. The Group 2 patients who were with a great span of levels of severity in clinical courses, had higher admission and mortality rate than Group 1 (p < 0.01). We concluded that flumazenil may serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of carefully selected patients. The use of flumazenil with our selective criteria will be cost effective, achieve rapid diagnosis and reduce laborious care in certain cases.", 
    "4": "1. The effect of chronic ethanol exposure on rat peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) was studied. 2. The binding of 3H-RO 5-4864 to PBR was increased (35.4%) in the kidneys of rats treated with 10% (v/v) ethanol for 12 weeks, but not in renal membranes isolated from rats exposed to ethanol 30% (v/v) during the same period. 3. Similarly, short-term administration of ethanol (4 weeks) did not alter the binding of 3H-RO 5-4864 to renal membranes. 4. To examine the possibility of a direct interaction of ethanol with PBR, in vitro experiments were carried out. Only high concentrations of ethanol (> 100 mM) caused a significant inhibition of 3H-RO 5-4864 binding in kidney, testis and cerebral cortex. 5. The results presented indicate that chronic ethanol exposure causes a time and dose-dependent increase in renal PBR.", 
    "5": "1. The effects of the low affinity benzodiazepine receptor ligand RU33368 were studied on rodent behaviours and on GABA-mediated synaptic transmission in rat cerebellar slices. 2. RU33368 inhibited stress induced ultrasounds in rat pups without inducing marked muscle relaxation. RU33368 also enhanced operant responding in rats that had been suppressed by mild footshock. These effects of RU33368 in these two models of anxiety were both blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 (flumazonil). 3. In cerebellar slices RU33368 enhanced stimulus-induced synaptic inhibition of Purkinje layer cells with a minimal effective concentration in the order of 1 microM. The classical benzodiazepine agonist RU32007 was approx. 10 times more potent. This action of RU33368 was blocked by Ro15-1788. 4. The minimal effective concentration of RU33368 fully blocked the effect of RU32007 in 2 of 4 cells tested and partially antagonized it in a third cell. 5. These data suggest that RU33368 is a partial agonist at benzodiazepine receptors and this, at least in part, explains its non-sedative anxiolytic behavioural profile.", 
    "6": "A series of methyl 9H-pyridazino[3,4-b]indole-3-carboxylates and related compounds were synthesized using a Diels-Alder reaction of methyl 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-propenoates and dibenzyl azodicarboxylate. Several compounds were found to have high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor. Their structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "7": "We report here a study of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors (pBZr) in mononuclear cells (MNC) from blood of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during periods of stable and active disease and from normal controls. Most active MS patients were retested in a longitudinal study, both during a treatment with high dose steroids and while medication free. Active MS produces a significant decrease of receptor density compared with the controls whereas remission of the disease shows no effect. Four weeks of steroid treatment restore binding density to normal levels, and two weeks of drug withdrawal result in a small, but significant increase in number of the binding sites compared with the control value. We suggest that the number of pBZr in blood MNC might change during the clinical course and steroid therapy of MS.", 
    "8": "We have previously reported that benzodiazepines inhibit microsomal steroid hydroxylases. We have now studied their effects at much lower drug concentrations and have also addressed the suggestion that benzodiazepines alter cellular calcium metabolism. We investigated the in-vitro effects of midazolam on microsomal steroid hydroxylation by measuring basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) synthesis. Threshold inhibition of basal cortisol production was achieved by 3.4 mumol midazolam/l while ACTH-stimulated production required 13.6 mumol/l. This was accompanied by a biphasic response of 17-OHP production, rising to a maximum at 13.6 mumol midazolam/l for basal and 6.8 mumol midazolam/l for ACTH-stimulated synthesis suggesting a preferential inhibitory effect on 21-hydroxylase activity at < 6.8 mumol/l and additional effects on 17 alpha-hydroxylation at higher drug concentrations. This explains the inhibition of ACTH-stimulated cortisol synthesis by midazolam (50% inhibitor dose (IC50) 22 mumol/l). Using 21-deoxycortisol as substrate, we have demonstrated that midazolam is a competitive inhibitor of 21-hydroxylase (inhibitory constant (KI) 35 mumol/l). Both midazolam and diazepam inhibited K(+)-stimulated aldosterone synthesis, with IC50 values of 1.2 mumol/l and 0.8 mumol/l respectively, which are far lower than those observed for ACTH-stimulated cortisol synthesis. With 11 beta-hydroxyprogesterone as substrate, the KI for the inhibition of aldosterone synthesis by midazolam was 54 mumol/l. Potassium stimulates aldosterone biosynthesis at least partly by changing intracellular free calcium levels. To investigate possible antagonistic effects of benzodiazepines on calcium metabolism, we measured 45Ca uptake in the presence of midazolam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "1. Responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were evoked in mouse fibroblast L-cells stably transfected with bovine, alpha 1, beta 1, gamma 2L sub-units of the GABAA receptor. Expression was stimulated via a steroid-inducible promoter system. 2. In near symmetrical intracellular and extracellular chloride concentrations, GABA evoked inward currents at negative holding potentials that reversed at +5 mV and displayed slight outward rectification. Concentration-response curves were fitted well by the logistic equation. GABA had a pEC50 = 5.1 +/- 0.1 and the curves had a slope of 1.9 +/- 0.1. 3. Responses to GABA were antagonized by bicuculline, picrotoxin and penicillin. The action of bicuculline was competitive (pA2 = 6.4) whilst the block by picrotoxin was uncompetitive and strongly agonist-dependent. 4. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists potentiated responses to 3 microM GABA. The rank order of potency was FG 8205 > flunitrazepam > zolpidem > C1218872. FG 8205 and C1218872 produced markedly lower maximal potentiations with efficacies 0.4 and 0.6 x that of flunitrazepam, respectively. The potencies of zolpidem and C1218872 observed are in agreement with the BZ1 type pharmacology of this sub-unit combination. The potentiation of GABA by flunitrazepam was antagonized by flumazenil with a Ki of 3.8 nM. 5. GABA responses were potentiated in the presence of pentobarbitone and alphaxalone. The response was also noticeably broadened by these compounds due to a decrease in the response decay rate. Concentrations of pentobarbitone of 100 microM and above evoked an inward current in the absence of GABA. Alphaxalone up to 10 microM did not evoke a direct response. 6. This expression system produced functional receptors that behaved in a fashion analogous to those found endogenously in other preparations. Thus, this system appears to provide a useful and versatile preparation for the analysis of sub-unit regulation of GABAA receptor pharmacology.", 
    "10": "Anticonvulsant properties of compounds that enhance GABA-mediated inhibition through modulatory sites on the GABAA receptor [phenobarbital (PB), clonazepam (CZP), alpha-ethyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-thiobutyrolactone (alpha-EMTBL)] were compared with anticonvulsant effects of compounds believed to be antagonists at these modulatory sites (Ro15-1788 and alpha-isopropyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone gamma-IMGBL)] and to 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[4,5-c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP, GABAA receptor agonist), (+/-) baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist), and gamma-vinyl GABA, a compound that increases endogenous GABA. The compounds were tested for their ability to block experimental seizures caused by maximal electroshock, pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), bicuculline (BIC), aminophylline, strychnine, and t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) in mice. CZP blocked all but strychnine seizures. PB was also highly effective, blocking all but TBPS seizures. alpha-EMTBL, representing a new class of experimental anticonvulsant drugs, prevented all seizures except strychnine (STR)- and aminophylline-induced seizures. The antagonists are effective only against one convulsant stimulus. Ro15-1788 and alpha-IMGBL prevented only DMCM- and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, respectively. THIP and gamma-vinyl GABA both blocked only BIC and picrotoxin seizures. Baclofen had no anticonvulsant activity. These data demonstrate that compounds that increase neuronal inhibition by potentiating the action of GABA have a broader spectrum of anticonvulsant action than either antagonists or GABAmimetic agents or compounds that increase endogenous GABA.", 
    "11": "Cerebral cortical cultured neurons were characterized for GABA-benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor complex, and the effect of chronic exposure of cortical neurons to GABA on GABA-BZ receptor system was investigated. In the intact cells, the [3H]flunitrazepam binding was rapid and saturable, with an apparent Kd of 4.2 +/- 1.5 nM and Bmax of 776 +/- 54 fmol/mg protein. Specifically bound [3H]flunitrazepam was displaced in a concentration-dependent manner by various BZ receptor ligands such as Ro15-1788, DMCM, Ro15-4513, clonazepam, alprazolam, diazepam and zolpidem, and enhanced by GABA, muscimol and pentobarbital. GABA induced enhancement of 36Cl-influx in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 9 +/- 2 microM). Chronic exposure of the cultured neurons to GABA resulted in a reduced [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]GABA, [3H]Ro15-1788, [3H]Ro15-4513 and [35S]TBPS binding, a reduced enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA, and a reduced GABA-induced 36Cl-influx susceptible to reversal by concomitant exposure of the cultures to R 5135, a GABAA-receptor antagonist. These findings indicate that cerebral cortical cultured neurons provide an ideal model to study GABA-BZ receptor complex using binding and 36Cl-influx assays, and chronic exposure of cortical cultures to GABA leads to a down-regulation of GABA-BZ receptor system. It is a GABAA receptor-mediated slow process.", 
    "12": "Rats submitted to one, two, or seven sessions of exploration to a new environment (habituation) or exposed to an inhibitory avoidance training showed different degrees of anxiety, evaluated by the elevated plus-maze test. Also, the brain regional levels of benzodiazepine (BDZ)-like molecules in rats submitted to one, two, or seven sessions of habituation were differentially decreased with respect to nontrained rats. The percentage of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze for each group correlates with the data of decrease in the BDZ-like immunoreactivity in amygdala (r = 0.77, p < 0.0005), hippocampus (r = 0.68, p < 0.0005), and septum (r = 0.57, p < 0.005). These results suggest that the limbic system responds to anxiogenic experiences by changing the BDZ-like molecule levels in relation to the degree of anxiety and/or stress that accompany these experiences.", 
    "13": "During infusion of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in humans, changes in ventilatory drive, appetite, and sleep have been reported. The mechanism by which BCAAs exert their effects on CNS remains unclear. Picrotoxin is a proconvulsant drug, acting as an antagonist on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Twenty rats were randomized to receive either an IP injection with 4% BCAAs (300 mg/kg; 8 ml/kg) (n = 10) or placebo (saline 8 ml/kg) (n = 10). The mean latency time from injection to onset of seizures was recorded as an indication of the seizure threshold. Latency time was significantly longer for BCAAs than for placebo, 11.2 (+/- 1.9) vs. 8.3 (+/- 1.8) min. Thus, a BCAA injection increased the seizure threshold to picrotoxin (p < 0.03). This suggests that BCAA infusion may exert effects on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "14": "The in vivo selectivity for central omega (benzodiazepine) modulatory site subtypes of ligands from several chemical classes has been evaluated by measuring the displacement of the in vivo binding of [3H]flumazenil to several rat central nervous system structures differentially enriched in omega 1 and omega 2 sites. This labeling was prevented in a dose-related manner by the i.p. administration, 30 min before the radioligand, of several benzodiazepine derivatives, the cyclopyrrolone derivatives suriclone and zopiclone, the triazolopyridazine derivative CL 218,872 and the imidazopyridine derivative zolpidem. Most of the benzodiazepine derivatives studied displayed in vivo some selectivity for omega 2-enriched structures. In contrast, oxoquazepam and CL 218,872 were 2- to 3-fold more potent at preventing [3H]flumazenil binding in omega 1-enriched (cerebellum) than in omega 2-enriched structures. Maximal inhibitions by zolpidem of in vivo [3H]flumazenil binding [cerebellum (100%) > cerebral cortex (79%) > or = striatum (74%) > hippocampus (52%) > spinal cord (37%)] were related to the relative omega 1/omega 2 distribution ratio in each structure. These differences did not result from an uneven distribution of this compound in the central nervous system. Quantitative autoradiographic studies performed on 30 central nervous system regions showed a strong correlation between the in vitro and in vivo regional selectivity of zolpidem. For all the drugs studied there was a significant global correlation between their potency at inhibiting [3H]flumazenil binding in vitro and in vivo either in the cerebellum (P < .001) or in the spinal cord (P < .01) and between the in vitro and in vivo cerebellum/spinal cord selectivity. The differential in vivo selectivity of zolpidem may account for the reported hypnoselective profile of this imidazopyridine in the rodent.", 
    "15": "The binding potencies for the putative M2-selective antagonist himbacine were determined in radioligand binding and in functional response assays in neuronal tissue and Chinese hamster ovary cells containing transfected muscarinic receptors. Himbacine was shown to bind to all five cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes in the order of potencies: hM2 = hM4 > hM3 > hM1 > hM5 (Kd values were 4, 7, 59, 83 and 296 nM, respectively). Himbacine was shown to bind to M2 receptors in rat heart and brain stem with Kd values of 6.9 and 4.6 nM, respectively. In rat brain tissues with complex mixtures of muscarinic receptors, and using the radioligand [3H] +/- -5,11-dihydro-11-([(2-(2-[(dipropylamino)methyl]-1- peperidinyl)ethyl)amino]carbonyl)-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazep ine-6-one to demarcate M2 and M4 receptors, himbacine was shown to bind to 80% of cortical or striatal receptors with Kd values of 4.5 and 3.8 nM, respectively, consistent with the involvement of M2 and/or M4 receptors in both these brain regions. Himbacine was a potent blocker of oxotremorine-M-mediated cyclic AMP inhibition in rat striatum (4.4 nM) and in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (10.6 nM), responses mediated by M4 receptors. Himbacine also reversed oxotremorine-M-mediated inhibition of evoked acetylcholine release from hippocampal tissue with a Kd value of 8.6 nM, a value consistent with the involvement of M2 or M4 receptors. At the cortical postsynaptic muscarinic receptors involved with phosphoinositide turnover (putative M1 and M3 receptors), himbacine was 21-fold less potent. Himbacine appears to be a potent muscarinic antagonist that displays selectivity for M2 or M4 receptors, as compared to M1 or M3 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Mice received i.p. injections of either saline or drug before i.p. administration of [3H]Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil), a selective benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist. Subjects were decapitated and six brain regions (cortex, cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and brain stem) were analyzed for the levels of tritium present in each tissue. Benzyl, ethyl and methyl alcohol enhanced in vivo binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in a dose-dependent manner in all brain regions studied with mean ED50 values of 2.4, 34.8 and 38.4% volume/kg body weight, respectively. Lorazepam (18 mg/kg) completely blocked effects of benzyl, ethyl and methyl alcohol to increase [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding. These data indicate that the alcohol-induced increases in [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding occurred at the level of the BZD receptor. In addition, these alcohols did not alter the in vivo binding of [3H]diprenorphine, an opioid receptor ligand, further indicating the selective effect of alcohol on BZD receptors. Administration of lorazepam or alprazolam produced a dose-dependent decrease in the binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 to brain tissue after administration of either saline or 30% volume/kg ethanol. However, low doses of alprazolam increased binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in the absence of ethanol. Together, these results suggest that ethanol produces an increase in the number of BZD binding sites in vivo. These alcohol-induced alterations in BZD receptor binding may mediate, in part, the anxiolytic or sedative properties of ethanol.", 
    "17": "The pharmacokinetics of [123I]iomazenil (Ro 16-0154) in 5 healthy human volunteers were compared to those in 2 hypothermic and 3 normothermic anesthetized monkeys. Following intravenous injection in humans and monkeys, [123I]iomazenil rapidly diffused outside the vascular bed and was cleared from the arterial plasma triexponentially. The clearance half-times in hypothermic animals were protracted to values closer to those of the human. [123I]Iomazenil was metabolized mainly to a polar radiometabolite (not extracted by ethyl acetate) in the human whereas an additional lipophilic radiometabolite was detected in the monkey. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that [123I]iomazenil established equal concentrations in association with the cellular and plasma component of the blood, indicating that the plasma clearance of [123I]iomazenil mirrors that of the blood. Analysis of organs from a monkey given [123I]iomazenil showed that the parent compound was actively taken up by peripheral organs; the polar radiometabolite accumulated mainly in the bile and the kidneys whereas the non-polar radiometabolite accumulated in the urine and kidneys. Greater than 90% of the radioactivity in the different regions of the brain was unchanged parent [123I]iomazenil.", 
    "18": "A single dose of ethanol (0.60 g/kg of body weight) was administered to eight young healthy male subjects 35 minutes before bedtime. Compared to the average value of two baseline nights, subjective sleep and polysomnographically determined sleep parameters were not significantly affected. In the first 2 hours of sleep after ethanol intake, the combined value of wakefulness, stage 1, and movement time was reduced. In this interval, visually scored stage 4 sleep was increased, and electroencephalographic (EEG) power density in nonrapid-eye-movement (nonREM) sleep was enhanced in the lowest delta frequencies and reduced in the beta range. Computed for the entire sleep episode, power density in REM sleep was enhanced in some theta frequencies. In the sleep episode initiated 24 hours after ethanol intake, power density in nonREM and REM sleep was enhanced in delta and theta frequencies, and the subjectively perceived number of awakenings was reduced. The effects of ethanol on EEG power spectra during sleep differ from those published for benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. This indicates that the effects of ethanol on the human sleep EEG are not mediated by the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "19": "A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of gait disturbance and dysuria. Neurological examination revealed limb and truncal ataxia, orthostatic hypotension, cogwheel rigidity in all limbs, generalized hyperreflexia without pathological reflex, and horizontal gaze nystagmus. She became progressively worse and bedridden at age 52. Then she developed abnormal eye movements. Electrooculogram revealed vertical, horizontal or oblique macro square wave jerks and pendular nystagmus. Macro square wave jerks appeared during fixation and disappeared with eye closure or in the dark room. Macro square wave jerks were characterized by a duration of about 200 msec and an amplitude of 10 to 15 degrees. Pendular nystagmus with a duration of several seconds and amplitude of 5 to 15 degrees appeared when she changed her fixation or the point of fixation disappeared. Macro square wave jerks and pendular nystagmus were mildly suppressed after the intramuscular injection of 100 mg of phenobarbital, the oral intake of sodium valproate of 600 mg/day or baclofen of 60 mg/day. They were almost completely depressed after the intravenous injection of 3 mg of diazepam or the oral intake of clonazepam of 1.5 mg/day. We suggested that both macro square wave jerks and pendular nystagmus in this patient might be caused by the dysfunction of GABAergic system in the saccadic eye movement system.",

Immediately prior to administering chemotherapy a cutaneous scopolamine patch was applied to the retroaural area, prochlorperazine 5 mg was given orally, and intravenous (IV) lorazepam 0.5 mg, ondansetron 10 mg and dexamethasone 10 mg were given. The last two were repeated after 4 hours twice, and lorazepam at 6 hour intervals for four doses. A chemotherapy course consisted of mitoxantrone 20 mg/m2 i.v., followed by thiotepa 60 mg/m2 followed by 3 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide as a constant infusion over 48 hours. There were 80 courses given to 30 women and one man with a median age of 42 years (29-58). Complete protection from vomiting in all 80 courses resulted. Minor nausea occurred in 25 courses. The antiemetic regimen was well tolerated and all patients received all the doses as prescribed.",

Clonazepam at 1.5% concentration (w/w) was suspended in a gel containing 1% (w/w) neutralized Carbopol 934 vehicled by a 50% water solution of propylene glycol and applied to the skin, in a thermostatically controlled chamber, after 10 min pretreatment with a lauryl alcohol enhancer. At 32 degrees C, the amount of clonazepam which diffused into the effluent after a 3 h lag phase was constant for 3 h and the flux averaged 0.486 mcg/h/cm2, whereas at 25 degrees C, the flux averaged 0.424 mcg/h/cm2. The amount of drug diffusing into the effluent was a function of the contact surface area and was independent of the rate of perfusion up to values of 1 ml/min. The apparent diffusion coefficient, Ds, and the partition coefficient, KM, were 2.75/10(6)/cm/h and 5.21, respectively.",

We describe the possible causative mechanisms of this reaction as well as their treatment.", 
    "23": "This report describes an improved method for the direct detection of a broad spectrum of drugs of abuse in hemolyzed whole blood by means of Syva Emit enzyme immunoassay. Improvements include a 1.5 to 10 fold increase in Emit assay sensitivity along with a 2 to 4 times increase in the normal number of assays per kit. This was accomplished by enzyme substrate and cofactor supplementation with a commercially available product (Raichem), assay reagent dilution, and extension of the absorbance measure time. The Emit drug abuse in urine (d.a.u.) assays used in this study included amphetamine, barbiturate, methadone, methaqualone, opiate, benzodiazepine metabolite, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene. The Emit serum assays used were the benzodiazepine and the tricyclic antidepressant assays. The within-run coefficients of variation ranged from 0.25 to 0.66%, and the between-run coefficients of variation ranged from 0.45 to 1.00%. The proposed method allows for the analysis of hemolyzed whole blood using both Emit d.a.u. and serum assays. It is sensitive and can detect therapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations of drugs in all assays tested. The method is simple, rapid, and allows for the direct analysis of a methanolic extract of whole blood without lengthy sample concentration steps. The method allows for the detection of highly potent drugs and for long-term monitoring of drug metabolites and conjugates. This could be beneficial for therapeutic drug monitoring, assessing patient compliance, and detection of previous drug use.", 
    "24": "Urine samples containing diazolo- and triazolobenzodiazepines and metabolites were hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase and extracted with methylene chloride. The extracts were treated with methyl iodide, methylene chloride, and tetrahexylammonium hydrogen sulfate in basic solution to form the methyl derivatives of the drugs and metabolites. GC/MS analysis resulted in the following test characteristics: day-to-day precision at 360 ng/mL (120 ng/mL for the triazolobenzodiazepine metabolites) was 2.4 to 5.5% CV; calibration curves were linear to 6000 ng/mL (1000 ng/mL for the triazolobenzodiazepine metabolites), and operational limits of quantitation were in the range 13-25 ng/mL.", 
    "25": "A solid-phase extraction procedure was developed for the isolation of acidic, neutral, and basic drugs from whole blood. A blood sample was sonicated, diluted with phosphate buffer, and the drugs were extracted on a mixed-mode bonded-phase silica column at pH 6.0. The extraction system was adjusted to pH 3.3 with acetic acid. After column drying, the drugs were selectively eluted from the column by two different eluates, which were collected separately. Acidic, neutral, and weakly basic drugs with lower pKa values (e.g., benzodiazepines) were present in the first acetone-chloroform (1:1) fraction. The other basic drugs were present in the second fraction (basic ethyl acetate). The drugs with pKa's close to the pH of the extraction system (pH 3.3) appeared in both fractions. The two fractions were evaporated until approximately 100 microL of solvent remained in the tube and were then analyzed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a wide-bore capillary column and flame ionization detector. The absolute recoveries of all tested drugs exceeded 81% at a concentration of 2 micrograms/mL.", 
    "26": "Triazolam is a very short-acting triazolobenzodiazepine with sedative-hypnotic properties. Approximately 2% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The major urinary metabolite is alpha-hydroxytriazolam glucuronide (70% of the dose). The objective of this study was to characterize the reactivity of alpha-hydroxytriazolam in the urine benzodiazepine assay by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA; Abbott TDx) in comparison with enzyme immunoassay (EIA; Syva EMIT d.a.u. benzodiazepine assay). alpha-OH triazolam at 300 ng/mL gave a response equivalent to the 200-ng/mL nordiazepam Abbott calibrator. In the EMIT assay, alpha-OH triazolam gave a response equivalent to the 300-ng/mL calibrator (Syva) at 100-200 ng/mL. Both immunoassays gave positive results in 9 out of 9 urine specimens collected from individuals receiving triazolam. Confirmation was performed by analyzing for alpha-OH triazolam after enzymatic hydrolysis and formation of a TMS derivative for GC/MS. All urine specimens were positive for alpha-OH triazolam. In conclusion, both the FPIA and EIA immunoassay screening assays are acceptable for detecting the presence of alpha-OH triazolam in the urine of patients receiving therapeutic doses of triazolam.", 
    "27": "When pediatric pain is refractory and unresponsive to appropriate use of analgesic agents, there might be additional physical or psychologic dimensions of the pain that are not addressed by the analgesics. In addition to appropriate analgesic therapy, the psychologic needs of the child should be directly addressed and appropriate adjunctive physical modalities employed. Although benzodiazepines lack direct analgesic effects, they can reduce the distress associated with acute pain states by decreasing anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms that can be associated with acute pain. Intermediate or long-acting benzodiazepines in modest doses can be useful adjunctive agents when used short term for the treatment of selected acute pain complaints. In the highly distressed school-age child or adolescent with pain complaints relatively unresponsive to appropriate care, judicious use of benzodiazepines is worthy of consideration.", 
    "28": "Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated as adjunctive therapy in the management of benzodiazepine overdose. Thirteen emergency departments enrolled 326 patients in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; 162 patients were randomly allocated to receive flumazenil (maximum dose, 30 ml, providing 3 mg of flumazenil), and 164 were allocated to receive placebo (maximum dose, 30 ml). A successful response was the attainment of a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), denoting a very much improved or much improved status, 10 minutes after the start of intravenous administration of the test drug. Among those patients whose drug screen revealed the presence of benzodiazepines, 75 (77%) of 97 patients given flumazenil and 13 (16%) of 83 given placebo attained such a response. The mean CGIS score at 10 minutes for benzodiazepine-positive patients treated with flumazenil was 1.95 versus 3.58 for those given placebo. As determined by the Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale, 61% of patients who initially responded became resedated; in these patients, the effect of flumazenil lasted a median of 90 minutes. At the investigator's discretion, patients who did not achieve a criterion response in the double-blind trial could receive open-label flumazenil, titrated as in the double-blind phase. Among the benzodiazepine-positive patients, 9 (53%) of 17 patients from the flumazenil group responded to the additional flumazenil, and 58 (81%) of patients previously given placebo responded. Safety was assessed in all 326 patients given the test drug. The most frequent adverse experiences after the administration of flumazenil were agitation (7%), vomiting (7%), abnormal crying (4%), and nausea (4%); these effects were observed with a lower frequency in the placebo group. Serious adverse experiences were reported in 4 patients; these included seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. Of the 3 patients with seizures, 2 had ingested large doses of cyclic antidepressants in addition to the benzodiazepine. The toxicology screen for 1 of the 2 showed 1900 ng/ml of amoxapine and 900 ng/ml of nortriptyline; the toxicology screen for the other, who also had ventricular tachycardia, showed 1928 ng/ml of loxapine and 301 ng/ml of amoxapine. The results of this study confirm published reports of the efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation in patients with benzodiazepine overdose. This was accomplished irrespective of the presence of coingested drugs. Flumazenil is not recommended for patients with serious cyclic antidepressant poisoning or those who use benzodiazepines therapeutically to control seizure disorders. When used as recommended, however, flumazenil has been shown to have an acceptable safety level.", 
    "29": "In a US double-blind, multicenter study, flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, administered postoperatively in a mean intravenous dose of 0.67 mg (range, 0.2 to 1 mg), was superior to placebo in reversing sedation and other central nervous system effects of benzodiazepines in outpatients recovering from general anesthesia induced by midazolam, fentanyl or sufentanil, and nitrous oxide. Within 5 minutes after administration of flumazenil, sedation was reversed in 94% (87 of 93) of flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 13% (6 of 46) of placebo-treated patients. The criterion response (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale score of 4 or 5) that was achieved at 5 minutes was maintained in 79 (93%) of 85 patients throughout the 180-minute observation period. Psychomotor performance, measured by the Finger-to-Nose Test, was rated as normal at 5 minutes posttreatment for 77% (71 of 92) of flumazenil-treated patients, and 4% (2 of 46) of placebo-treated patients. The reversal of amnesia, as determined by the Picture Recall Test was less consistent. Patients given flumazenil did not experience more pain at the operative site or require more analgesic medication than did those given placebo. Nausea (flumazenil 24%; placebo 15%), dizziness (flumazenil 12%; placebo 2%), and vomiting (flumazenil 10%; placebo 9%) were the most frequent adverse effects in each group. In conclusion, flumazenil provided prompt arousal from benzodiazepine-induced sedation and was well tolerated.", 
    "30": "Flumazenil was studied in a double-blind multicenter trial to confirm its efficacy and safety in antagonizing the central effects of benzodiazepines after general anesthesia (midazolam, short-acting narcotic, nitrous oxide) with muscle relaxants and selected potent volatile anesthetics as needed. One hundred seventy-two outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either flumazenil or placebo titrated to the point of reversal of sedation or a maximum dose of 1 mg of flumazenil or 10 ml of placebo. The test drug was given intravenously (0.2 mg flumazenil or 2 ml placebo) at 1-minute intervals. Tests of alertness, psychomotor function, and memory were conducted prestudy and at baseline before the administration of flumazenil and at 5-, 15-, 30-, 60-, 120-, and 180-minute intervals after administration. The changes from prestudy or baseline scores were analyzed to compare differences between treatment groups. Seventy-five percent of the 105 flumazenil-treated patients and 14% of the 55 placebo-treated patients who met the qualifications for efficacy evaluations obtained a criterion level of response as measured by the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Most (76%) patients who were alert at 5 minutes maintained their level of wakefulness throughout the 180-minute observation period. All 172 patients were included in evaluations of safety. Fifty percent of 113 flumazenil-treated patients and 31% of 59 placebo-treated patients reported one or more adverse experiences. The most frequently reported were nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Only 6 adverse effects in the flumazenil group and 1 in the placebo group were considered severe; the remainder were mild or moderate. None were considered serious or potentially serious. Postoperative administration of flumazenil (mean dose, 0.85 mg) safely provided a prompt, controlled reversal of the sedative and psychomotor effects of midazolam in most patients.", 
    "31": "A double-blind clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, in 146 hospitalized patients, who had had general anesthesia induced by midazolam and a long-acting opioid. Ninety-eight patients received flumazenil and 48 received placebo. Administered postoperatively at a mean intravenous dose of 0.84 mg (range: 0.2 mg to 1 mg), flumazenil reversed benzodiazepine-induced sedation to a greater extent than did placebo. At 5 minutes posttreatment, 61 (76%) of 80 flumazenil-treated patients and 7 (18%) of 40 placebo-treated patients had attained a score of 4 or 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, indicating that they were drowsy or fully awake and alert. This level of arousal was maintained for the full 180-minute posttreatment assessment period in 79% of flumazenil-treated patients. Between-group differences in mean change from baseline in level of alertness were statistically significant (P < 0.01) until 60 minutes posttreatment, when the spontaneous recovery of placebo-treated patients resulted in declining intergroup differences. The global efficacy rating (based on the physician's general impression of the effectiveness of the reversal of sedation 5 minutes after test drug administration) was good or excellent in 64 (80%) of the 80 flumazenil-treated patients and 5 (13%) of the 40 placebo-treated patients evaluated. Flumazenil, compared with placebo, was not associated with an increased frequency of operative-site pain, and no serious adverse effects of this benzodiazepine antagonist were reported. The most frequent adverse experiences in both treatment groups were nausea, shivering, and operative-site pain. Vomiting, dizziness, and injection-site reactions were also reported in > or = 5% of patients treated with flumazenil.", 
    "32": "Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant widely used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, is often supplemented with short-acting opioids for general anesthesia. Administered postoperatively, flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, reverses the CNS sedative effects of midazolam. In a double-blind clinical trial in hospitalized patients, flumazenil, administered postoperatively at an average intravenous dose of 0.89 mg (range: 0.4 mg to 1 mg), was more effective than placebo in reversing sedation and other residual effects of benzodiazepines in patients recovering from general anesthesia induced by midazolam (mean dose 29 mg) in conjunction with fentanyl (mean dose 0.4 mg) or sufentanil (mean dose 0.056 mg). Five minutes posttreatment, 87 (83%) of 124 flumazenil-treated patients and 6 (10%) of 60 placebo-treated patients had attained the criterion response for reversal of sedation. Of these patients, 60% in the flumazenil group, compared with 100% in the placebo group, retained their degree of alertness throughout the 3-hour observation period. Between-group differences were significant until 60 minutes posttreatment, when the effect of the benzodiazepines had spontaneously waned in the placebo group. The Physician's Global Efficacy Rating, providing an overall measure of efficacy 5 minutes after test drug administration, was good or excellent for 86% of the flumazenil-treated patients, as compared with 7% of the placebo-treated patients evaluated. Measurements of psychomotor function and memory also showed significant between-group differences. Flumazenil, compared with placebo, was not associated with a substantially greater frequency of operative-site pain. These results demonstrate that the efficacy and safety of flumazenil were not compromised by the addition of a short-acting opioid to the anesthetic regimen.", 
    "33": "The efficacy and safety of a new benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, were assessed in a double-blind multicenter study. Flumazenil (mean dose, 0.76 mg) or placebo (mean dose, 8.9 ml) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients, respectively, who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid (fentanyl, meperidine, or morphine) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures. The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flumazenil and 64 patients given placebo. After 5 minutes, 80/115 (70%) flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 21/63 (33%) placebo-treated patients, were completely awake and alert, as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Ninety-five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5-minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180-minute assessment period. Flumazenil-treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger-to-Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5-minute assessment. Flumazenil was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported. Thirty-nine (30%) of flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 17 (25%) of placebo-treated patients had one or more drug-related adverse experiences. The most common adverse effects were nausea and vomiting in the flumazenil group and nausea and injection-site pain in the placebo group. Flumazenil was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids.",

In a double-blind, multicenter study, postoperative patients who had been sedated with intravenous diazepam were randomly allocated to receive intravenous doses of flumazenil (0.4 mg to 1 mg) or placebo. Levels of sedation and psychomotor impairment were evaluated prestudy, at baseline, and at 6 intervals from 5 to 180 minutes posttreatment. A global evaluation of effectiveness was made at the 5-minute assessment, and memory was assessed at the 180-minute assessment. Flumazenil (mean dose: 0.73 mg [7.3 ml]) was significantly more effective than placebo (mean dose: 8.9 ml) in reversing sedation, psychomotor impairment, and amnesia within 5 minutes after the start of administration. At the 5-minute posttreatment assessment, 84% of 102 flumazenil-treated patients (compared with 42% of 52 placebo-treated patients) experienced complete reversal of sedation. Ninety-two percent of 93 flumazenil-treated patients (compared with 41% of 46 placebo-treated patients) had normal psychomotor function. Reversal of amnesia at the 5-minute assessment was achieved in 75% of 101 flumazenil-treated patients and in 20% of 51 placebo-treated patients. Statistically significant differences between flumazenil and placebo were also observed at the 15-minute assessment. Thereafter there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Most (70%) flumazenil-treated patients exhibited no recurrence of sedation during the 180-minute assessment period. The most frequent adverse reaction in the flumazenil group was dizziness (6%). There were no serious adverse experiences related to the test drug. Flumazenil provided prompt, controlled reversal of residual effects, especially sedation, in the majority (84%) of patients recovering from intravenous conscious sedation induced by diazepam. For most (70%) of these flumazenil-treated patients, the reversal was maintained throughout the 180-minute assessment.",

In a double-blind, multicenter study, 240 patients were administered flumazenil postoperatively at an average intravenous dose of 0.7 mg (7 ml) and 114 patients were administered an average dose of 9 ml placebo. Complete reversal of sedation was observed in 80% of flumazenil-treated patients and 30% of placebo-treated patients 5 minutes posttreatment. In 87% of patients who responded to flumazenil, the level of alertness was maintained throughout the 180-minute observation period. Midazolam-impaired psychomotor performance returned to normal 5 minutes posttreatment in 80% of the flumazenil-treated patients and 28% of the placebo-treated patients. Flumazenil was less effective in reversing midazolam-induced amnesia, with only 70% of flumazenil-treated patients (and 15% of placebo-treated patients) able to recall the picture shown them at the 5-minute assessment, and fewer patients able to recall pictures shown at later times. Flumazenil was well tolerated, although adverse effects were reported slightly more often than in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse events in both groups were dizziness and nausea. Vital signs were not affected.",

In this US double-blind, multicenter study, the efficacy of flumazenil was compared with that of placebo in antagonizing the effects of midazolam, a benzodiazepine used to induce intravenous conscious sedation. The mean dose of flumazenil was 0.7 mg, administered intravenously. At 5 minutes posttreatment, 82% of 131 flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 15% of 65 placebo-treated patients, demonstrated complete reversal of sedation. In 85% of patients who responded to flumazenil, this reversal of sedation was maintained throughout the 180-minute observation period. Psychomotor performance returned to prestudy levels 5 minutes posttreatment in 87% of the flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 28% of the placebo-treated patients. At the doses administered, flumazenil was less effective in reversing midazolam-induced amnesia, with only 60% of patients demonstrating partial recovery of memory. It was, nevertheless, more effective than placebo. Flumazenil was well tolerated. Dizziness (10%) and nausea (9%) were the most frequently reported adverse effects. Results of this study demonstrate that flumazenil antagonizes the central nervous system effects of midazolam after intravenous conscious sedation.", 
    "37": "1. Glycopyrrolate, a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound had biphasic effects on the contraction of guinea-pig atrium. At concentrations between 0.4 and 20 microM, glycopyrrolate induced a small but consistent increase in the contraction force. 2. Further increase in the concentration of glycopyrrolate produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the force of contraction with a EC50 of 0.24 mM. 3. This negative inotropic effect was opposed by a Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644. Glycopyrrolate also antagonized potently the depressant effects of carbachol and acetylcholine in guinea-pig atrium. 4. Schild analysis showed a pA2 value of 8.16 against carbachol and 8.39 against acetylcholine. These similar pA2 values suggested that both compounds may have a common interacting site. The interactions however cannot be explained by a simple competition model as the slopes of the Schild plots were larger than unity. 5. The mutual competition between glycopyrrolate and quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), gallamine or methoctramine indicated that glycopyrrolate could have multiple action sites in the atrium. Interaction at an allosteric site was implicated. 6. Radioligand binding studies showed that glycopyrrolate displaced pirenzepine (PZ) and AF-DX 384 from their binding to the M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in guinea-pig brain membranes respectively. 7. The respective binding constants (Kis) were 0.60 and 0.03 nM. The Hill coefficient value (nH) for glycopyrrolate against [3H] PZ was larger than unity, suggesting positive cooperativity at the receptor complex. In contrast, the nH of the agonist [3H] AF-DX 384 was not different from unity, indicating a simple competitive inhibition. 8. Our results confirm the antimuscarinic properties of glycopyrrolate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Exposure of isolated rat glomeruli to carbachol (Carb) 1 mM induces glomerular (mesangial cell) contraction which is inhibited by pirenzepine. To identify the cellular signalling mechanism, we analyzed Carb-activated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in myo-[2-3H] inositol preloaded cells of isolated rat glomeruli. Carb evoked a rapid (5 s, 30.4 +/- 8.3% of basal) and sustained (60 s, 157.2 +/- 1.2% of basal) inositol trisphosphate (IP3) response. Acetylcholine 100 microM (Ach) in the presence of eserine also evoked IP3 formation. Mobilization of Ca2+ was monitored by preloading glomerular cells with 45Ca2+ (200 microCi/ml) and analyzing the cellular efflux using a constant perifusion system. Both Carb and Ach induced transient 45Ca2+ efflux, with peak values above baseline of 69.0 +/- 19.9 and 71.5 +/- 7.9%, respectively. Incubation with pirenzepine or prior release of Ca2+ from an IP3-sensitive intracellular pool by Thapsigargin (2 microM) prevented Carb-evoked Ca2+ release (100 and 60%, respectively). Therefore, glomerular cells possess functional cholinergic receptors which stimulate contraction via IP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release.", 
    "39": "Stimulation of muscarinic receptors increases phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in 132-1N1 human astrocytoma cells. To evaluate the subtype of receptors which mediate PI hydrolysis in 132-1N1 cells, the effects of: a) the nonselective M1 agonist, carbachol; b) the selective M1 agonist, 4-hydroxy-2-butynyl-trimethylammonium chloride-m-chlorocarbinilate (McN-343); c) the nonselective antagonists, atropine and scopolamine; d) the relatively selective M1 antagonist, pirenzepine; e) the relatively selective M2 antagonists, AF-DX 116 (11-2-diethylaminomethyl-1-piperidinylacetyl-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido-2,3-b-1,4-benzodiazepine-6-one) and methoctramine and f) the relatively selective M3 antagonist, hexahydrosila-difenidol (HHSiD) on PI hydrolysis in 132-1N1 cells were studied. The cell pools of inositol-phospholipids were prelabelled by incubating 132-1N1 cells in a low inositol containing medium (CMRL-1066) supplemented with [3H]inositol (2 microCi/ml) for 20-24 hours at 37 degrees C. The cells were washed and resuspended in a physiological salt solution, and PI hydrolysis was measured by accumulation of [3H]inositol-1-phosphate (IP) in the presence of 10 mM LiCl. Carbachol produced time and concentration dependent PI hydrolysis (EC50, 37 microM). McN-A343 did not cause significant hydrolysis of PI in 132-1N1 cells indicating that the receptor was not of M1 type. All the above muscarinic antagonists caused a concentration dependent decrease in the level of IP in response to carbachol (100 microM). The rank order of their affinities (pA2 values) was: atropine (8.8) > HHSiD (7.6) > pirenzepine (6.8) > methoctramine (6.0) > AF-DX 116 (5.8). This rank order supports the concept that M3 (other names, M2 beta, glandular M2) receptors are linked to PI hydrolysis in 132-1N1 cells. HHSiD, which is selective for M3 receptors of the smooth muscle has higher affinity for muscarinic receptors in 132-1N1 cells than AF-DX 116 which is selective for M2 receptors in cardiac tissue. If the receptor in 132-1N1 cells had been M2, part of the rank order for affinities would have been methoctramine > AF-DX 116 > HHSiD > pirenzepine. From all of these observations, the muscarinic receptor for PI hydrolysis in 132-1N1 cells is tentatively characterized as of M3 type.", 
    "40": "A 1.45 kb DNA sequence encoding the rat alpha 6 GABAA receptor subunit (nucleotides 33-1483) was cloned from a Sprague-Dawley rat brain cDNA library by PCR amplification. Dideoxy sequencing of two individual clones revealed that the nucleotide sequence differed at only one basepair (T480-->G) from that published previously. This difference altered the deduced amino acid sequence, producing a conservative amino acid substitution (His121-->Gln). A Gln residue is present at the same location in the bovine alpha 6 subunit. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the total PCR product demonstrated that this variant of the rat alpha 6 subunit was the only allele found in this particular rat brain library, the original allele was not present. These results were further verified by RNAse protection assays performed with RNA isolated from individual rat cerebella. alpha 6, beta 1, and gamma 2S subunits were transiently expressed in L929 cells for electrophysiological analysis. Whole-cell recordings obtained from the cells demonstrated that GABAA receptor channels with the expected GABA and benzodiazepine pharmacology were produced. Excised outside out single channel recordings from the same cells revealed that GABA elicited brief duration openings to a 33 pS main conductance level and to at least one smaller (approximately 21 pS) subconductance level. Thus this allelic variant of rat alpha 6 subunit could assemble with other subunits to form a functional GABAA receptor channel with similar properties to the original allelic form.", 
    "41": "Rats can readily acquire conditional discriminations in which mixtures of drugs serve as compound internal discriminative stimuli. Excitotoxic lesions in the region of the nucleus basalis have been shown to impair the acquisition of conditional discriminations based upon external visual stimuli, but nothing was known about their effects on discrimination of internal stimuli. A baseline of undiscriminated bar-pressing for food reinforcers was established prior to surgery. Lesions were made by infusing either ibotenic or quisqualic acid bilaterally into the basal forebrain (the ibotenate-induced lesions had been shown previously to impair cortical cholinergic function and to produce non-specific damage). After surgery, rats were trained to discriminate effects of drug mixtures using a standard, two-bar operant conditioning procedure. The ibotenate, but not the quisqualate, lesion impaired the acquisition of a discrimination of a mixture of (+)-amphetamine plus pentobarbitone, while neither lesion impaired acquisition with a mixture of (-)-nicotine plus midazolam. The ibotenate lesions also reduced overall rates of responding in both experiments. Thus, the deficit in the acquisition of drug discrimination in rats with ibotenate lesions had some pharmacological specificity, but could not be related easily to disturbances in neocortical cholinergic function. In comparisons with other published data, the results suggest a possible dichotomy in the processing of interoceptive and external information in the basal forebrain, a major target of ventral striatal overflow.", 
    "42": "Agents which enhance the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can severely disrupt behavioral recovery in rats following damage to the neocortex if delivered during a sensitive postoperative period. The mechanisms of this disruption have not been found. It has been suggested previously that the ipsilateral striatum and related structures may be transiently disabled after cortical lesions and that diazepam may interfere with restoration of function in these areas. In the present experiment, the subcortical anatomical effects of chronic (3 weeks) administration of diazepam, an indirect GABAergic agonist, were assessed following unilateral lesions of the anteromedial cortex (AMC) or the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) in rats. Atrophic and degenerative changes were examined in the striatum, substantia nigra and thalamus. Following either AMC or SMC lesions, there was a reduction in the size of the ipsilateral striatum and thalamus and a loss of neurons in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). After AMC lesions, striatal atrophy and neuron loss in the SNr were increased by the diazepam regimen relative to vehicle-treated controls. In addition, diazepam interfered with the behavioral recovery from somatic-sensorimotor asymmetries in AMC-lesioned rats. After SMC lesions, the sites of striatal and thalamic atrophy were different from that observed after AMC lesions, and the extent of atrophy and neuron loss was not exaggerated by diazepam treatment. Consistent with these data, diazepam did not significantly affect recovery from SMC lesions. These findings suggest that the long-term disruptive effects of diazepam on recovery of function after AMC lesions may be related to an augmentation of lesion-induced degeneration.", 
    "43": "Emission computer tomography offers a unique opportunity to examine functional receptor processes. With the help of specific exogenous radioligands for the various receptor systems of the brain it is possible to visually depict receptor-neurotransmitter interactions, metabolic consequences and changes in diseased conditions. Although radioligands for application in positron emission tomography (PET) are relatively numerous, those for single photon emission tomography (SPECT) are markedly fewer. However, the general availability of the SPECT method gives the SPECT radioligands a special significance. The known SPECT ligands for brain receptors are introduced and discussed. While for certain receptor systems (eg glutaminergic and opiate) no generally useful substances are available, in the case of other receptors (eg cholinergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and the benzodiazepine system) certain molecules are undergoing clinical evaluation. Iomazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, is on the verge of clinical application. Particularly in the case of partial epilepsy, and also possibly in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, this SPECT radioligand is seen as a clear advance in diagnostic methodology. In the light of Iomazenil studies it has been shown how the reproducible analysis of SPECT images can be improved using the Talairach atlas. Finally, the question of whether and how SPECT methodology could be used to determine receptor affinity constant and receptor density is discussed. It is apparent that, under certain conditions (eg., low unspecific binding, slow kinetic etc.), the determination of affinity constants should be feasible using this approach.", 
    "44": "A ventrally located false aneurysm (7 x 5.2 x 3.4 cm) of the right common femoral artery occurred, after left-heart catheterization by the Judkins technique via this artery, in an 83-year-old woman with aortic valve stenosis. Colour Doppler sonography demonstrated a puncture canal (neck of the aneurysm) filling in both systole and diastole, as well as turbulent flow within the aneurysm. Flow into the aneurysm was considerably reduced when the transducer head compressed the aneurysm, while flow continued in the femoral artery and vein. This compression, maintained for 25 min, completely thrombosed the puncture canal and aneurysm so that no vascular surgery was required.", 
    "45": "A series of rigid planar azadiindoles (8a, 8b, and 8d), benzannelated pyridodiindoles (11a, 11b, and 11d), and indolopyridoimidazoles (11c, 20, and 24) were synthesized from 4-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline 5 via the Fischer indole cyclization with the appropriate arylhydrazines. These analogues were employed as probes (\"molecular yardsticks\") to define the spatial dimensions of the lipophilic regions of the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) binding cleft. Benzannelated indoles 11a-d and indolopyridoimidazoles 20 and 24 were important in establishing an area of negative interaction (S1, see Figure 6, part b) in the binding cleft common to the interactions of both inverse agonists and agonists. Data from this chemical and computer-assisted analysis of the pharmacophore (see Figure 6) indicates that inverse agonists and agonists bind to the same binding region, but the pharmacophoric descriptors required for the two activities are different, in keeping with previous studies with these planar ligands. However, the hydrogen bond donating site H1 and the lipophilic region L1 in the receptor binding site are common interactions experienced by both series of ligands. The low affinities of both indolo[3,2-c]carbazole (3a) and indolo[3,2-b]isoquinoline (3b) for the BzR are consonant with the requirements of a hydrogen bond acceptor interaction at donor site H1 and a hydrogen bond donor interaction at acceptor site A2 for potent inverse agonist activity in the beta-carboline series. The hydrochloride salts of 1-aza- 8a (IC50 10.6 nM), 2-aza- 8b (IC50 51.5 nM), and 4-azadiindole 8d (IC50 11.2 nM) were found to be much more soluble in water than the corresponding salt of the parent diindole 2. Moreover, aza analogues 8a and 8b were shown to be partial inverse agonists with proconvulsant potencies comparable to that of the parent diindole 2.",

These analogs were used both to probe the dimensions of the hydrophobic pocket in the benzodiazepine receptor and to test the predictive ability of a previously reported 3D-QSAR regression model. Of the new analogs synthesized, the gamma-branched derivatives (isobutoxy, 7, IC50 = 93 nM; isopentoxy, 9, IC50 = 104 nM) display significantly higher affinity for the BzR than either the beta-branched (sec-butoxy, 6, IC50 = 471 nM; tert-butyl ketone, 12, IC50 = 358 nM) or delta-branched (isopentoxy, 8, IC50 = 535 nM) analogs. An exception to this rule is the gamma-branched 3-benzyloxy derivative 10 (IC50 > 1000 nM) which appears to have a chain length that is too long to be accommodated by the BzR. The standard error of prediction for these six new beta-carbolines using the original regression model is significantly lower than the standard error estimate of the cross validation runs on the training set, hence the predictions made using this model are much better than expected. In order to obtain more credible predictions, a new procedure called GOLPE (generating optimal linear PLS estimates) was used to eliminate irrelevant electrostatic and steric descriptors from the regression equation. A substantial reduction in the standard error estimate resulted. The predictions from this new regression equation were somewhat less accurate than the ones obtained with the original regression equation; however the standard error of prediction and the standard error estimate are in much closer agreement. Finally, to probe the effect that the quality of the steric and electrostatic potentials has on 3D-QSAR analyses, the semiempirical MNDO parallel PRDDOE geometries and Mulliken charges used in the original analyses were replaced with ab initio 3-21G parallel 6-31G* geometries and electrostatic potential fit charges. A modest decrease in the standard error estimate and increase in cross validated R2 resulted.",

    "51": "Whole cell recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons using electrode chloride concentrations of 12-80 mM demonstrated that the effect of synaptic activation of GABAA receptors was dependent on the transmembrane chloride gradient. When the chloride reversal potential was positive to action potential threshold, GABAA receptor activation was excitatory, and anticonvulsant barbiturates and benzodiazepines enhanced this excitation. Enhancement of GABAergic excitation of interneurons may contribute to the efficacy of these drugs, while enhancement of GABAergic excitation of principal neurons may be an important mechanism of failure, such as occurs in the treatment of neonatal seizures.", 
    "52": "\"Endozepines\" are endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine recognition sites on gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors in the nervous system. Idiopathic recurring stupor (IRS) is a syndrome of spontaneous stupor or coma that is not associated with known metabolic, toxic, or structural abnormalities but can be reversed by flumazenil, a pure benzodiazepine antagonist. We measured endozepine-2 and endozepine-4 by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioreceptor assay in serum and cerebrospinal fluid from three patients with IRS. During episodes of stupor there was a large (up to 300-fold compared with control patients) increase of endozepine-4 content in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, but a return to normal concentrations between attacks. Endozepine-4 may contribute to, or be the cause of, IRS. The reasons for abnormal concentrations of endozepine in blood and brain are unknown.", 
    "53": "Benzodiazepines, besides interacting with central-type receptors which mediate their well-known pharmacological actions, bind to peripheral-type receptors that are distributed in a variety of peripheral tissues including numerous endocrine organs. The present work was designed to investigate the effects of a selective peripheral-type benzodiazepine, 4'-chlordiazepam (Ro 5-4864), on glucose-induced insulin secretion in vitro. In the rat isolated pancreas perfused with a Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing 8.3 mM glucose, the drug (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) induced a progressive and significant decrease in insulin release. Concomitantly, it induced a vasodilator response of the pancreatic vascular bed. In rat isolated islets incubated for 1 h in the presence of 15 mM glucose, 4'-chlordiazepam (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) induced a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of insulin release. In contrast, the selective central-type benzodiazepine, clonazepam (10(-6) - 10(-4) M), did not significantly modify glucose-induced insulin secretion. In addition, experiments were performed to test the effect of 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline-carboxamid e (PK 11195), a peripheral non-benzodiazepine ligand proposed as a putative antagonist. This substance did not counteract the inhibitory effect of 4'-chlordiazepam but itself (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) elicited a potent inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. These results show that drugs such as 4'-chlordiazepam and PK 11195 which have a high affinity for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, in contrast to a central-type benzodiazepine agonist, inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion in vitro.", 
    "54": "High-affinity binding of warfarin, salicylate and diazepam to four natural mutants of human serum albumin was studied by equilibrium dialysis at pH 7.4. The mutants Alb Milano Fast and Alb Vanves possess single amino acid substitutions close to the C-terminus, namely 573 Lys-->Glu and 574 Lys-->Asn, respectively. By contrast, Alb Catania and Alb Venezia are chain termination mutants in which several amino acids have been changed or deleted. Binding of warfarin to the variants was lower than binding to normal (wild-type) albumin (Alb A). The association constants were 73% (Alb Milano Fast, Alb Vanves and Alb Catania) or 67% (Alb Venezia) of that determined for Alb A. The results obtained with salicylate were more dependent on the type of mutation. The constants were either comparable to the normal value (Alb Catania) or reduced to 64% (Alb Milano Fast), 71% (Alb Vanves) or 43% (Alb Venezia) of that value. Diazepam binding to the variants was normal, except for binding to Alb Venezia in which case the association constant was reduced to 76% of that calculated for Alb A. The results are in accordance with the view that warfarin, salicylate and diazepam bind to three different high-affinity sites. It is proposed that the sites for warfarin and salicylate are situated rather close to each other in domain II, and that these high-affinity sites are relatively susceptible to conformational changes of the protein. By contrast, the primary diazepam site is placed closer to, or within, domain III of albumin and seems to be less affected by conformational changes in the protein molecule.", 
    "55": "A large range of substituted imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines have been synthesized, and a number of potent ligands at central benzodiazepine (Bz) receptors on rat brain membranes have been identified in initial binding screens using [3H]diazepam. For those tested more extensively, binding studies conducted in the presence and absence of gamma-aminobutyric acid suggest that they were full receptor agonists. Some preliminary evidence was found suggesting some species selectivity, i.e. several of the compounds were more active in in vivo tests in rats than in mice. The agonist activity of these 2-phenyl (and substituted phenyl) imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines is consistent with the model of Bz receptor ligands as proposed by Fryer [Raven Press, 1983, pp. 7-20]. Several compounds were identified which had more selective activity at peripheral-type (mitochondrial) Bz binding sites. Thus, substituted imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines represent yet another class of low molecular mass compounds which have activity at Bz receptor sites.", 
    "56": "This study investigates the effects of benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists on the locomotor and exploratory behaviour of mice when tested in a familiar environment. The weak partial inverse agonist Ro 15-3505 (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increased locomotion and hole-dipping in habituated mice. However, the more efficacious partial inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg i.p.) and Ro 19-4603 (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on these parameters. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (3, 10, 20 mg/kg i.p.) also increased locomotion and hole-dipping in habituated mice, although like Ro 15-3505, these effects were of short duration occurring largely in the first 15 min following injection. Opposite effects were obtained with the partial benzodiazepine agonist Ro 17-1812 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg i.p.) which produced a longer-lasting significant decrease in hole-dipping behaviour in habituated mice without altering locomotion. Finally, in contrast to its effects in habituated animals, Ro 15-3505 (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg i.p.) did not modify either locomotion or exploration in mice which were tested in a novel environment, showing that the effects of the inverse agonist were state-dependent. This demonstration that, under certain conditions, the weak benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Ro 15-3505 and the antagonist flumazenil, produce behavioural activation is in accordance with the work of others suggesting that these classes of compound may increase arousal and may therefore be of some value in treatment of memory disorders.", 
    "57": "The quantitative autoradiographic analysis of muscarinic cholinergic and GABAA (benzodiazepine) receptors was performed on selected regions of the cerebral cortex and striatum of rats flown in the Soviet Biosatellite COSMOS 2044. An age- and strain-matched synchronous ground-based control group was employed for comparison. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor density was found to be significantly lower in the striatum of the flight animals as compared with that in the synchronous control group. No significant differences between flight and synchronous control groups were found in the other regions examined. GABAA (benzodiazepine) receptors showed no significant differences between the flight and control groups in any of the regions sampled. Although additional studies are needed to reach definitive conclusions, the decrease in muscarinic cholinergic receptors observed in the striatum suggests spaceflight-related alterations in motor activity.", 
    "58": "Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) is a neuropeptide that has been detected in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Previous studies have suggested the possible role of DBI as a potential endogenous anxiogenic ligand modulating GABAergic transmission at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex. The measurement of DBI immunoreactivity (DBI-IR) in CSF of panic-disorder patients and normal controls was undertaken to assess whether there were differences in the CSF concentration of this peptide to assess possible relationships with other monoamines and peptides. Lumbar CSF was obtained from 18 panic patients (4 men, 14 women) and 9 controls (5 men, 4 women). As a group, no significant differences were found between panic patients' CSF concentration of DBI-IR (1.12 +/- 0.27 pmol/mL) and normal volunteers (1.23 +/- 0.27 pmol/mL). No gender differences were demonstrated. However, we did find a positive correlation between CSF levels of DBI and CSF corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) in our panic patients.", 
    "59": "In this study, we assessed whether endogenous CCK is involved in the regulation of interdigestive gastrointestinal and gallbladder motility in conscious dogs with force transducers chronically implanted in the gastric antrum, duodenum, jejunum and gallbladder. L364718 at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg was used as a specific and potent CCK receptor blocker, and its effect on spontaneous interdigestive motility and plasma motilin release were examined. Additionally, the contractile activity of exogenous synthetic canine motilin (20-100 ng/kg) with or without pretreatment with L364718 at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg was assessed. Whether the blocking effect of L364718 on CCK receptors was sufficient or not was verified by giving CCK-OP at a bolus dose of 10 ng/kg. As a result, cyclic changes in interdigestive motor activity and the plasma motilin concentration were not affected by pretreatment with L364718. L364718 also did not affect motilin-induced interdigestive contractile activity in the gastrointestinal tract and gallbladder. On the other hand, the effect of CCK-OP was completely abolished by pretreatment with L364718. It is concluded that endogenous CCK is not involved in the regulation of spontaneous and motilin-induced interdigestive contractions in the canine gastrointestinal tract and gallbladder.",

[11C]Ro15-4513 was highly accumulated in frontal cortex, temporal cortex, hippocampus and relatively lower accumulation in occipital cortex, whereas almost homogeneous distribution of Ro15-1788 throughout cortex area was seen. The kinetic analysis revealed that such differences of regional distribution in brain between two labelled ligands were mainly due to the regional difference of the dissociation rate constants in vivo (k4).

    "65": "We describe a novel model of status epilepticus produced by the focal application of bicuculline methiodide into the deep prepiriform cortex of rats pretreated with lithium chloride. Three out of eight rats pretreated with one dose of lithium (3 mmol/kg) 24 h prior to induction of seizures by focal bicuculline, and eight out of 12 rats pretreated with two doses of lithium (at 24 and 48 h) prior to seizure induction, exhibited continual uninterrupted convulsive seizure activity (status epilepticus) lasting between 10 min and > 2 h. This status epilepticus which was manifest both behaviorally and electroencephalographically, was sensitive to reversal by diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) given as long as 2 h after the onset of sustained status epilepticus. Pilocarpine (25 mg/kg) pretreatment also predisposed to status epilepticus in response to the focal application of bicuculline, but diazepam (5 or 10 mg/kg i.p.) was ineffective in suppressing the status epilepticus in the presence of pilocarpine.", 
    "66": "To clarify the role of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the hypoxia/hypoglycemia (ischemia)-induced functional deficit in hippocampal neurons, we examined the effect of cholinergic drugs on ischemia-induced impairments of glucose uptake and CA1 field potentials in hippocampus slices. Muscarinic receptors were subdivided into M1 (high affinity for pirenzepine) and M2 (low affinity for pirenzepine) subtypes. The M1 receptor subtype is coupled to an increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the M2 receptor subtype is associated with inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The greater potency of carbachol in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis resulted in exacerbated ischemia-induced deficits. Treatment with the muscarinic receptor antagonists scopolamine and pirenzepine (M1 receptor-selective antagonist) had a strong dose-dependent protective effect against ischemia-induced deficits. Oxotremorine and McN-A-343, weak stimulators of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and strong inhibitors of adenylate cyclase, had a weak neuroprotective action against ischemia-induced deficits. These results suggest that stimulation of M1 muscarinic receptors coupled with an increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis may play a facilitatory role in ischemia-induced deficits. Stimulation of M2 muscarinic receptors may play an inhibitory role in ischemia-induced neuronal deficits.", 
    "67": "Abecarnil, a beta-carboline acting at benzodiazepine receptors, has been shown to have anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties in a number of models. It has reduced muscle relaxant and incoordinating effects in comparison to diazepam. Given the wide clinical application of diazepam to prevent alcohol withdrawal seizures, a genetic animal model was employed to compare abecarnil with diazepam for its anti-withdrawal effects. Withdrawal Seizure Prone (WSP) mice, genetically selected to develop severe handling-induced convulsions after withdrawal from chronic ethanol treatment, were exposed to ethanol vapor for 24 h. WSP mice given doses of abecarnil or diazepam at the peak of withdrawal had significantly reduced handling-induced convulsion scores. While abecarnil was slightly more potent than diazepam, its effects were shorter-lasting. Similar results were seen in an experiment where withdrawal handling-induced convulsions were assessed after a single high-dose ethanol injection. Abecarnil and diazepam also reduced the smaller handling-induced convulsion scores seen in naive WSP mice. Single doses of abecarnil or diazepam did not lead to a rebound elevation of handling-induced convulsion scores suggestive of a withdrawal reaction.", 
    "68": "Ethanol administration to rats for 30 days resulted in a significant decrease (-28%; P < 0.05) in the density of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBR) in the olfactory bulb. The reduction in [3H]PK 11195 binding persisted 24 hr after cessation of alcohol and had returned to normal values when measured 4 days later. Alterations were confined to this brain region and were not detected in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum or hippocampus. [3H]PK 11195 binding was elevated in the liver (100%; P < 0.01), heart (43%; P < 0.01) and testis (27%; P < 0.05) 30 days following ethanol consumption and this persisted for 1 and 4 days after abrupt withdrawal. A transitory decrease (-20%; P < 0.05) in MBR density was observed in the adrenal gland following 30 days of alcohol ingestion, but disappeared during withdrawal. The alterations in these receptors may be relevant to the cellular damage or dysfunction induced by chronic exposure to ethanol.", 
    "69": "The temperature dependence of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) binding to rat brain membranes was examined in the presence of the anaesthetics, pentobarbitone, alphaxalone and propofol. Van't Hoff plots showed the binding of FNZ to be largely enthalpy driven. Alphaxalone and propofol increased the entropy of the binding reaction but not the enthalpy and therefore did not show temperature dependence in their efficacy. In contrast, pentobarbitone increased the enthalpy of FNZ binding and, therefore, is more efficacious at low temperatures. The EC50 values of all three modulators increased with temperature indicating that their interactions with the receptor may be enthalpy driven. The EC50 values of all three modulators were also anion dependent, showing a decrease in the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA)-channel permeant anions. The efficacies of alphaxalone and pentobarbitone, but not that of propofol, also increased with increasing chloride ion concentration. The results indicate that all three modulators interact with the GABAA receptor at distinct recognition sites.",

The present article utilises a value-analysis strategy to outline the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of benzodiazepines from a variety of perspectives including those of the patient, physician and manufacturer. Results of this analysis suggest that these medications are effective when used appropriately, but that implementation of appropriate use is difficult. Remedies to this situation are discussed.",

    "77": "The behavioral effects of abecarnil, a beta-carboline which has been suggested to function as a partial and/or selective agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, were assessed in baboons. In a chronic administration study, 100mg/kg/day abecarnil for 6-8 weeks produced few signs of sedation: lip droop and intention tremor were observed in two of the four baboons. Flumazenil administration (5mg/kg, i.m.) on day 8 of chronic abecarnil produced only a mild precipitated benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Vehicle substitution after 6-8 weeks of chronic abecarnil produced transient signs of a mild withdrawal syndrome, including decreased food intake, but did not produce vomiting, twitches/jerks or seizures. In a self-injection study, abecarnil (0.032-1.0mg/kg/injection) did not maintain rates of self-injection above vehicle control levels; higher rates of self-injection were maintained in the same animals by cocaine (0.32mg/kg/injection) and triazolam (0.01mg/kg/injection). The highest i.v. abecarnil dose (1.0mg/kg/injection) produced sedation and ataxia in two of the three baboons. In a drug discrimination study, generalization from lorazepam training conditions (1.8mg/kg, p.o.) to abecarnil was an increasing function of dose, and maximal drug lever responding occurred reliably in all baboons 5h after 10-32mg/kg, p.o. abecarnil administration. Flumazenil (0.32mg/kg, i.m.), given 4h after abecarnil, completely antagonized the abecarnil stimulus in test sessions 1h later. The present experiments show that the behavioral profile of abecarnil is clearly distinguisable from that of benzodiazepines.", 
    "78": "A procedure is described for training mice to discriminate 30mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) from saline when lever pressing was maintained under a fixed-ratio 20 schedule of milk presentation. To define the pharmacological profile of the PTZ stimulus in mice, generalization testing was conducted with oxazepam and Ro 15-4513 (sarmazenil). Consistent with data obtained by others in rats, oxazepam (1mg/kg) blocked the PTZ stimulus whereas Ro 15-4513 substituted for PTZ, but only at a dose (2mg/kg) that also decreased rates of responding. The effects of both a depressant and excitatory vapor in this model were also determined. The volatile anesthetic methoxyflurane (1000-2000 ppm) blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of PTZ in a concentration-dependent manner, while the convulsant vapor flurothyl (900 ppm) produced greater than 90% PTZ-lever responding without disrupting rates of responding. The PTZ-like discriminative stimulus effects of flurothyl were dose-dependently blocked by oxazepam (0.03-1.0mg/kg). As has been shown in numerous previous studies in rats, PTZ could be established as a discriminative stimulus in mice. PTZ discrimination could be blocked by a benzodiazepine agonist and shares some properties with a benzodiazepine inverse agonist. Substitution and antagonism studies can also be performed with vapors, illustrating the utility of this model for comparing their behavioral effects to those of more widely studied drugs.", 
    "79": "The effects of acutely administered benzodiazepines have largely been validated in male animals, in spite of the fact that the majority of anti-anxiety drugs are prescribed for female patients. A study was carried out assessing the potential of female mice in the testing of the anxiolytic properties of drugs. Three doses (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0mg/kg) of the benzodiazepines diazepam and nitrazepam were given to individually-housed female Swiss mice before dyadic encounters with anosmic, group-housed males. Videotape analysis of the encounters, using an ethopharmacological technique, revealed suppressive effects of diazepam (1.0 and 2.0mg/kg) and nitrazepam (all doses) on avoidance/flee, confirming the anxiolytic properties of these drugs. However, some doses of diazepam (2.0mg/kg) and nitrazepam (1.0mg/kg), greatly increased immobility with little effect on active behavioural elements. It is suggested that \"immobility\" does not simply measure sedation.",

We determined whether a continuous midazolam infusion, the effects of which are antagonized by flumazenil when the arousal test is needed, is associated with good control of the timing of arousal and with no adverse reactions. In a randomized study of 20 patients (10 in each group), we compared arousal with flumazenil during midazolam-narcotic anesthesia with an arousal test done during halothane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, both under conditions of controlled hypotension. Motor responses to verbal command were obtained 39.1 +/- 36.0 s (mean +/- SD) after the injection of flumazenil in eight patients. Two patients form this group awoke spontaneously 6 and 8 min after terminating the administration of nitrous oxide and midazolam but remained sedated up to the time of the test itself. In the halothane group, arousal occurred 26 +/- 8.3 min after halothane administration was terminated and 10.1 +/- 3.3 min after nitrous oxide was stopped. Two of the patients in this group moved, owing to early arousal 5 and 8 min before the scheduled time and needed reinstatement of anesthesia. In four patients in the halothane group, we had to wait 3-11 min after the scheduled time before satisfactory arousal was achieved. One of the patients in the halothane group showed a motor deficit of the lower limbs during the wake-up test that disappeared after decreasing the spine correction.

Midazolam has no adverse effect on in vitro development of two-cell-to-blastocyst-stage embryos nor on in vivo fertilization and cell division at concentrations approximating and exceeding those that ova are exposed to during clinical anesthesia.

More recently, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) hypothesis in which an increase in the GABA-ergic tone and the presence of one or more GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ligands which interact with that receptor, has been proposed. We investigated the levels of GABA and ammonia in plasma of patients with acute PSE to test the hypothesis that elevated plasma GABA levels would be found in acute encephalopathy and that GABA levels would correlate with the degree of hepatic encephalopathy. We measured plasma levels of GABA and ammonia during an acute episode of PSE, spontaneous or precipitated by gastrointestinal bleeding or sepsis, and performed assessments of PSE by the PSE index. Patients were evaluated before and two days after standard treatment with lactulose. We also measured plasma GABA levels in the hepatic vein of a selected group of patients undergoing hemodynamic studies. Plasma GABA levels were significantly higher in patients with acute PSE (458 +/- 108 pmol/mL) when compared with normal subjects (110 +/- 23 pmol/mL) (p < 0.01) although no correlation was found between plasma GABA concentration and the degree of PSE.

There was a positive correlation between the time spent in PB and the individual hypoxic ventilatory drive. The relation between PB, nocturnal desaturation, and mountain sickness intensity are discussed. Acclimatization decreased the latency toward PB and improved sleep. Hypnotic benzodiazepine intake (loprazolam 1 mg) did not worsen either SWS depression or apneas and allowed normal sleep reappearance after acclimatization.", 
    "84": "Discontinuation of alprazolam after long-term treatment of 142 patients with panic-related disorders was examined in five study sites using a telephone interview. The majority (67%) of patients interviewed discontinued alprazolam for a period of at least 3 days after a gradual dosage reduction schedule over a 4-week period at the end of the long-term treatment study. A marked difference among the study sites in percentages of patients discontinuing therapy with alprazolam suggests that physician intervention played an important role in determining the ability of patients successfully to discontinue use of alprazolam: 90% and 95% of patients ceased therapy at two sites whereas only 21%, 38%, and 66% of patients discontinued therapy at the other three sites. The mean daily dosage for patients who continued using alprazolam decreased from 5.1 mg/day at the end of the long-term segment to 2.7 mg/day at the time of the poststudy interview. This decline indicates a lack of tolerance to the therapeutic effectiveness of alprazolam over an extended period of time.", 
    "85": "The widespread use of benzodiazepines remains a source of concern to the medical profession and the general public, especially as newer compounds come on the market. Our goal was to characterize long-term alprazolam users in the community and to determine whether such use represented abuse or behavioural dependence. We conducted three community surveys to learn about the natural history of long-term alprazolam use. Current long-term alprazolam users (those using the drug for 3 months or longer) were recruited on three separate occasions 1 year apart by identical newspaper advertisements in the metropolitan Toronto area. All respondents were mailed a questionnaire with a stamped, addressed return envelope. Our data from 312 respondents show that: (1) the majority of patients have a substantial history of prior medication use for symptom control (65%), (2) dose escalation is not a characteristic of long-term use, (3) patients change their initial pattern of regular use to one of symptom control only when required, (4) most physicians do not discuss discontinuation of the drug with their patients, (5) patients frequently try to stop their drug use (with a median of 2 attempts) and often report symptoms upon discontinuation, and (6) patients perceive a need for medication use and indicate that alprazolam is effective (75%). We conclude that some patients persistently use alprazolam but that this use does not represent abuse or behavioral dependence.", 
    "86": "The benzodiazepines have replaced widespread use of barbiturates and other sedatives. They are effective, safe medicines used to treat a variety of disorders associated with excessive CNS excitability. Although many physicians avoid prescribing benzodiazepines to adolescents, there is little evidence to support this practice. Unless an adolescent has a history of substance abuse/dependence and suicidal ideation, the benzodiazepines are safe. Benzodiazepine toxicity rarely occurs unless another CNS depressant, especially alcohol, is used concurrently.", 
    "87": "We evaluated and compared the effects of medetomidine-propofol and medetomidine-midazolam-propofol anesthesia in rabbits. Fourteen New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to receive either medetomidine (0.25 mg/kg, i.m.)-atropine (0.5 mg/kg, i.m.)-propofol (4 mg/kg, i.v.) (n = 7) or medetomidine (0.25 mg/kg, i.m.)-atropine (0.5 mg/kg, i.m.)-midazolam (0.5 mg/kg, i.m.)-propofol (2 mg/kg, i.v.) (n = 7). Five minutes after medetomidine-atropine or medetomidine-atropine-midazolam i.m. injection, propofol was administered i.v. Both medetomidine and medetomidine-midazolam rapidly (within 5 minutes) immobilized all rabbits and greatly eased the i.v. administration of propofol. Endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily after propofol injection in both groups. There was no significant difference between medetomidine-propofol and medetomidine-midazolam-propofol-treated rabbits in heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, or end-tidal CO2. The addition of midazolam to the medetomidine-propofol regimen significantly (P < 0.05) prolonged the duration of ear-pinch analgesia (25.0 +/- 7.1 vs. 36.7 +/- 8.9 minutes), the time from extubation to sternal recumbency (0.0 vs. 26.7 +/- 8.1 minutes), and the time from extubation to standing (0.0 vs. 39.5 +/- 11.3 minutes) without inducing significant changes in arterial blood pressure and end-tidal alveolar CO2. We consider both medetomidine-propofol and medetomidine-midazolam-propofol combinations to be safe and effective regimens for induction and short-term anesthesia in rabbits.", 
    "88": "Postmortem changes of triazolam concentrations in body tissues were examined using rats, in order to find the most suitable tissue samples for toxicological analysis. Triazolam was orally given to rats (5 mg/kg), and then the rats were sacrificed 1 hour after administration. Tissue samples were collected 0, 1 and 2 days after storage at 22-24 degrees C, and the triazolam concentration in each sample was measured using gas chromatography with a nitrogen phosphorus detector. Triazolam concentrations were markedly increased in the spleen, the abdominal muscle, the liver and the kidney, and were slightly increased in the blood and the lung. On the other hand, no changes were observed in the thigh muscle or the brain, and the value in the thigh muscle was similar to those in the blood samples collected immediately after death. The results indicate that triazolam diffuses into the surrounding tissues through the stomach wall after death, so that the thigh muscle and the brain have to be analyzed as well as the blood for a correct diagnosis of triazolam ingestion.", 
    "89": "Four hundred and two patients with peptic ulcer were selected for acute therapy with either pirenzepine (100 mg/day) or cimetidine (800 mg/day) using the envelope method. Those who achieved healing within 3 months (251 patients) were randomized in a double-blind fashion to maintenance therapy with either pirenzepine (75 mg/day) or placebo. In a preliminary study of 163 patients in which a multiple regression life-table method was employed, 4 out of 15 possible predictors were found to have a significant influence on relapse. These were site of ulcer lesions, psychological stress, endoscopic findings at the time of healing of the original ulcers, and acute therapy. Stratified analysis of the evolution of relapse by the Cutler-Ederer life-table method indicated that several other factors also influenced relapse in certain patient subgroups. Most relapses (93.8%) occurred at the same site as, or close to the site of, the original ulcers, indicating that ulcer scars also play a role in relapse.", 
    "90": "1. The literature relating to the effects of benzodiazepines in general, and temazepam in particular, on human psychomotor performance as assessed using microcomputer-based testing batteries is surveyed. 2. The adverse effects of central nervous system depressants on performance is an important mediocolegal issue and frequently comes into question in on-the-road and on-the-job accidents. The use of microcomputer-based testing batteries allows for performance evaluation both in the laboratory and at-the-scene, as well as providing the opportunity to model a large number of different behaviours required in routine yet complex psychomotor tasks. 3. The conclusions in general are: (1) The benzodiazepines as a class of drugs impair both cognitive and motor performance. These effects are often subtle when low doses are involved or when testing occurs the morning following evening administration of the medication. (2) No single psychomotor task adequately simulates complex daily tasks such as automobile driving. A battery of tests that evaluates a number of the components of such tasks is necessary to determine adequately the full range of effects of these medications.", 
    "91": "Flumazenil is effective in reversing sedation resulting from benzodiazepine (BZD) toxicity. Its use for other causes of sedation have not been well described. A 23-y-old male was found unconscious. Upon being aroused, the patient stated he had recently ingested 1 1/2 bottles of vodka/beer and 250 mg of diazepam. Physical examination revealed shallow breathing and respiratory depression. Arterial blood gases were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of respiratory depression (pH 7.34, pCO2 47, pO2 99). However, after receiving 3 mg of flumazenil, the respiratory depression improved so that the patient no longer required intubation. The drug screen returned negative for BZDs and the patient had a blood alcohol level of 332 mg/dl. He later denied BZD use. The patient's clinical course improved throughout the study period, and mechanical ventilation was avoided. This report reflects a possible role for flumazenil in reversing the respiratory depression produced by ethanol ingestion.", 
    "92": "Propofol was compared with Midazolam for sedation during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a randomised, double blind study. Both drugs were equally acceptable to endoscopists and patients. There was significant oxygen desaturation after sedation and during endoscopy (p < 10(-6)). Significantly more patients in the propofol group could remember the diagnosis which was revealed to them immediately after the gastroscopy (p < 0.001).", 
    "93": "This study examined the influence of morningness-eveningness on night shift sleepiness in 15 subjects. Sleepiness was assessed during a five-night protocol involving the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), repeated test of sustained wakefulness (RTSW) and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS). Daytime sleep was estimated by sleep diaries and wrist actigraphy. The sample was divided by median score on the Horne and Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Physiological sleep tendency was significantly worse between 0030 and 0430 hours for the Morning Tendency group than for the Non-Morning Tendency group. The Morning Tendency group reported obtaining less daytime sleep than the Non-Morning Tendency group; however, there was no difference between groups in total daytime sleep estimated by actigraphy. This preliminary study suggests that morning types are sleepier during night shift hours than non-morning types.", 
    "94": "The interactions of caffeine (10 mg/kg p. o.) with various doses of ethanol, diazepam or pentobarbital were investigated by observing the ambulatory activity of mice. The ambulatory activities after the coadministration of caffeine with ethanol (1.6, 2.4 and 3.2 g/kg p. o.) were significantly higher than those after the single administration of the corresponding doses of individual drugs. Ethanol alone significantly increased the activity with ataxia at 2.4 and 3.2 g/kg, suggesting that 1.6 g/kg of ethanol was an optimum dose for studying the interaction of caffeine with ethanol. Although diazepam (0.25, 0.5 and 2 mg/kg s. c.) and pentobarbital (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg s. c.) alone did not change the activity, they significantly reduced the effect of caffeine. Naloxone (1 and 5 mg/kg s. c.) did not modify the effect of caffeine alone, but, at 5 mg/kg, it was effective in significantly reducing the ambulation-increasing effect of caffeine with ethanol (1.6 g/kg) to nearly the level of caffeine alone. Ca-cyanamide (5 mg/kg p. o., pretreatment 30 min before), reserpine (1 mg/kg s. c., pretreatment 4 hr before) and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (200 mg/kg i. p., pretreatment 1 hr before) reduced the ambulation increment induced by caffeine alone or combination of caffeine with ethanol. Ethanol, diazepam and pentobarbital are classified as CNS depressants, and caffeine as a CNS stimulant. However, the present experiment demonstrated that the interaction of caffeine with ethanol was very different from that of caffeine with diazepam or pentobarbital. In the enhancing interaction of caffeine and ethanol, both dopaminergic and endogenous opioid systems may be involved.", 
    "95": "The influence of varying protein and fat content in milk of New Zealand White rabbits on the milk-to-plasma drug concentration (M/P) ratio of diazepam was studied. At various time points after littering, a bolus dose (1.5 mg/kg) followed by a 26-hr infusion (1.8 mg/h) of diazepam was administered to freely moving rabbits via a jugular vein catheter. Milk and blood samples were collected to allow characterization of milk composition and quantitative determination of diazepam and nordazepam in milk and plasma. At steady state diazepam showed M/P ratios between 3.7 and 9.5, whereas nordazepam showed ratios between 2.1 and 4.3, respectively. The relative importance of milk protein binding and milk-fat partitioning for the excretion of a drug into milk depended on the drug's affinity to milk fat. A stepwise multiple regression analysis suggested that observed M/P ratios of diazepam could be explained by considering the fat content of milk alone. Nordazepam with a lower solubility in milk fat showed M/P ratios which could be best explained by considering protein and fat concentrations together. Using the data from the infusion studies, two recently published diffusional models to predict M/P ratios were evaluated. Neither model could accurately predict the M/P ratios of diazepam and nordazepam observed in rabbits. However, after extending the model described by Atkinson and Begg to take the actually measured partitioning between skim milk and milk fat into account, a great improvement in the predictive power for observed M/P ratios occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "96": "The effects of drugs on the convulsions induced by the combination of a new quinolone antimicrobial, enoxacin, and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, fenbufen, were studied in mice. The combination of enoxacin at 30 or 100 mg/kg, p.o. and fenbufen at 100 mg/kg, p.o. induced convulsions; and the mice died as a result of the convulsions. Pretreatment with either phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid intraperitoneally, or morphine intravenously did not influence the convulsions. A high dose of diazepam or clonazepam prolonged the survival time, but could not prevent the mice from dying. After the occurrence of convulsions induced by enoxacin with fenbufen, administration of the excitatory amino acid antagonist MK-801 at 1 mg/kg, i.v. extended the survival time, even though all the mice died as a result of the convulsions. Simultaneous intravenous injections of MK-801 and diazepam suppressed the convulsions. This suppression was stronger than that produced by MK-801 or diazepam, injected separately. However, no mouse survived at the end. From these results, participation of both GABA-ergic and excitatory amino acidergic systems in the convulsions induced by enoxacin and fenbufen was discussed.", 
    "97": "In order to prevent some negative side effects of ketamine during \"dissociative anaesthesia\", this substance is regularly combined with benzodiazepines, e.g., midazolam. This study was undertaken to develop a simple and effective method for the simultaneous detection of ketamine and midazolam in plasma by high-pressure liquid chromatography with UV-detection (HPLC/UV). METHODS. The chromatographic system consisted of a 300 x 3.9-mm C18 column for reversed-phase chromatography and a mobile phase of 30% acetonitrile and 70% 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.45. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. UV-detection took place at a wavelength of 210 nm. Blood samples were preferably taken from a central venous or arterial line. After plasma separation, 1 microgram (100 microliters) etidocaine was added to 1 ml plasma as an internal standard. The samples were alkalinised and extracted with ether, followed by back-extraction of the organic phase in 250 microliters 0.05 N sulphuric acid; 50 microliters of this solution was injected into the system. RESULTS. Sample preparation by trained personnel was reliable and led to adequate results. Separation of ketamine and midazolam was very satisfactory. Standard curves for both drugs were linear from 15-4000 ng/ml (ketamine r = 0.9998; midazolam r = 0.9996). Recovery rates for ketamine in plasma were above 95%, for midazolam 70%-75%. Coefficients of variation for ketamine in plasma were between 0.6% and 1.3%, for midazolam between 2.0% and 2.6%. The detection limit was lower than 5 ng/ml. CONCLUSION. The method is suitable for clinical practice and allows the simultaneous detection of two anaesthetics in wide-spread combined use.", 
    "98": "Ketamine is a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of optical isomers that have almost identical pharmacokinetic properties but different pharmacodynamic effects. The S-(+)-isomer of ketamine has about twice the anaesthetic and analgesic potency of the racemic ketamine preparation and is judged to induce less psychic emergence reactions and to be followed by a more rapid recovery of vigilance. The present study was designed to assess whether the S-(+)-isomer of ketamine is superior to the racemic mixture in cardiovascular characteristics, emergence reactions and cognitive functions, and whether side effects may be reduced or prevented by administration of midazolam prior to injection of S-(+)-ketamine. METHODS. Following ethics committee approval and informed consent, 30 volunteers were randomly allocated in this double-blind study to three groups of 10 each. Group 1 received 2 mg/kg bw racemic ketamine, group 2, 1 mg/kg bw S-(+)-ketamine and group 3, 1 mg/kg bw S-(+)-ketamine after premedication with 0.1 mg/kg midazolam i.v. Cardiovascular changes, state of vigilance, cognitive performance, subjective mood and acceptance of anaesthesia were assessed by means of haemodynamic routine monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests and interview. RESULTS. The increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate following the injection of racemic ketamine and S-(+)-ketamine were identical and the differences from baseline values significant after both. Premedication with midazolam ensured stable haemodynamics after injection of S-(+)-ketamine. EEG analysis displayed the characteristic changes well known from ketamine anaesthesia for both racemic and S-(+)-ketamine. The vigilosomnoscript showed an identical profile of vigilance up to 30 min after injection of both drugs. The vigilance status after 125 min was less impaired by S-(+)-ketamine than by racemic ketamine. Psychological assessment showed a prompter recovery of visual attentiveness and sensorimotor performance in the S-(+)-ketamine group. Subjective mood was judged by the volunteers to be significantly better after S-(+)-ketamine, and volunteers found S-(+)-ketamine to be more acceptable than racemic ketamine. The frequency of dreams was the same after both drugs. No unpleasant dreams were reported after S-(+)-ketamine, but one of the volunteers who received racemic ketamine had uncomfortable dreams. Midazolam prevented any unpleasant emergence sequelae. On the other hand, the cognitive performance could not be restored to the baseline values until at least 240 min after injection of S-(+)-ketamine, because of the sedative effects of midazolam. DISCUSSION. These results suggest that S-(+)-ketamine offers the advantages of faster recovery of cognitive performance, greater acceptance by the volunteers and identical depth of anaesthesia after injection of half the dose compared with racemic ketamine. The clinical use of S-(+)-ketamine therefore seems to be justified. Premedication with benzodiazepines, e.g. midazolam, is essential. The dose to be administered, however, should be carefully selected in order not to abolish the positive effect of S-(+)-ketamine on vigilance by the sedative effects of the benzodiazepine.", 
    "99": "Six patients were given flumazenil (1 mg) during the anhepatic period of liver transplantation. We found higher mean plasma flumazenil concentrations during the anhepatic period than occurred in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. It was only possible to measure plasma flumazenil concentrations in four patients after revascularisation of the donor liver. Of these, elimination half-lives could be calculated in only three patients (normal in one and prolonged in two). In these two patients the elimination half-lives were prolonged to the same extent as in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The changes during the anhepatic period occur because the liver contributes to the central volume of distribution. After revascularisation of the donor organ the prolonged half-lives indicate that transplanted livers may not recover normal metabolic functions immediately."
