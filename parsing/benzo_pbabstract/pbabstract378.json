The results were compared to those obtained in the same animals in control experiments, before treatment, and in four untreated dogs. Pirenzepine absorption was checked by measuring plasma concentrations. Pirenzepine led to a significant reduction in acid and pepsin secretion in response to histamine. In response to food, the reduction in secretion was concomitant with a reduction in gastrin and histamine release. Baseline concentrations of gastrin were reduced, while those of histamine were unchanged. No side effects were observed. After treatment, a long time lapse (about 15 weeks) was required for acid and pepsin secretion and gastrinemia to return to control levels, while histamine release in response to food normalized rapidly. Pirenzepine fixes selectively to M1 muscarinic receptors of the synaptic ganglion, thus inhibiting the effect of vagal stimulation, especially on pepsin secretion. Our data suggest that it might also fix to M1 receptors located on ECL cells, thereby reducing histamine release. In addition, pirenzepine probably fixes to other muscarinic receptors inhibiting gastrin release and resulting in a G and secretory cell mass reduction, probably by increasing somatostatin release.", 
    "1": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats developed posthypoxic myoclonus following 10-min cardiac arrest and resuscitation. In current studies, roles of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate, AMPA, and kainate), and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the pathophysiology of posthypoxic myoclonus were investigated. Treatments with the competitive or noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D[-]-AP-5) (ED50: 12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or MK-801 maleate (ED50: 0.034 mg/kg, i.p.), and competitive or noncompetitive non-NMDA (AMPA/kainate) receptor antagonist, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) (ED50: 9.25 nM/5 microliters, i.c.v.) or 1-(4-ami -nophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy -5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466) (ED50: 0.67 mg/kg, IP), significantly decreased myoclonus episodes in rats. On the other hand, treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, L(+)-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (L[+]-AP-3) (50 or 500 nM/5 microliters, i.c.v., exerted no significant effect on myoclonus scores in posthypoxic rats. These results indicate that activation of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors receptors may mediate posthypoxic myoclonus in rats, whereas, involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors needs to be studied further.", 
    "2": "Previously, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) decreased food intake when administered ICV but not when administered peripherally to rats. Amylin, which has a close structural homology to CGRP, reduced food intake administered IP at concentrations higher than those previously tested for CGRP. We examined the effects of higher doses of IP-administered CGRP on food intake. CGRP reduced food intake from 25 to 200 micrograms/kg in mice. CGRP did not reduce water intake and was not aversive in a two-bottle test. Using a lever press, CGRP was more effective at reducing milk consumption in prefed than in nonprefed mice. The effect of CGRP on food intake was not antagonized by the cholecystokinin A receptor antagonist, L364,718. These studies suggest a role for CGRP as a satiating factor.", 
    "3": "Administration of a relatively large IP dose of sulfated cholecystokinin (26-33) (CCK-8; 1.0 mumol/kg) consistently induced moderate taste aversion conditioning (TAC) using a 20-min, one-bottle test in Long-Evans rats. Because CCK-8 has affinity for both CCKA and CCKB receptor subtypes, we wanted to determine the subtype involved in CCK-8-induced TAC. Pretreatment with the selective CCKA antagonist MK-329 (L-364, 718 or devazepide), at doses of 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mumol/kg, markedly antagonized (> 70%) CCK-8-induced TAC. Pretreatment with the selective CCKB antagonist L-365,260, at doses of 0.1 or 1.0 mumol/kg, partially antagonized (approximately 50%) CCK-8-induced TAC, although the highest dose of L-365,260. 10.0 mumol/kg, did not. These partial antagonistic effects of L-365,260 on CCK-8-induced TAC were replicated in our second study. In our third study, we observed that another CCKB antagonist, the dipeptoid CI-988, also partially antagonized CCK-8-induced TAC at a dose of 0.1, but not 1.0 or 10.0, mumol/kg. In our final study, pretreatments with a single dose (i.e., 10.0, but not 0.1 or 1.0, mumol/kg) of either MK-329 or L-365,260 were also shown to partially antagonize the formation of moderate TAC induced by treatment with LiCl at 708 mumol/kg. Marked antagonism of LiCl-induced TAC was also observed following pretreatment with the known anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide HCl at 7.4 mumol/kg. Considering the existing data on the induction of TAC by various CCK analogues, we consider an action of CCK-8 on peripheral CCKA, but not CCKB, receptors necessary for the induction of TAC. Our results of partial antagonism of CCK-8- and LiCl-induced TAC by L-365,260, CI-988, or MK-329 suggest, but do not prove, that both CCKA and CCKB mechanisms may be operative during TAC. Because the CCK antagonists affected TAC like chlordiazepoxide, blockade of CCKA and CCKB mechanisms may produce a mild anxiolytic effect.", 
    "4": "The literature review of combination therapy of schizophrenia with neuroleptics and benzodiazepines is presented. Early trials from the 60s are difficult to evaluate because of the heterogeneity of the patients' groups selected, non-standardized evaluation methods and different diagnostic criteria. The more recent trials, methodologically more correct, were aimed at the allevation by the benzodiazepines of anxiety and agitation symptoms often observed in schizophrenia. The trials aimed at the efficacy of co-therapy with neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, (mainly alprazolam) in schizophrenia were less frequent. As the result, not univocally positive effect of such a therapy was found. The differences in clinical effect might be caused by the individual susceptibility to the anxiolytics. The attempts to correlate various clinical effects of combination therapy with neuroleptics and benzodiazepines and the biological changes in central nervous system in schizophrenia, are also discussed.", 
    "5": "A traffic accident caused by a man who declared that he was driving under influence of drugs (Temesta), led our laboratory to develop a procedure for the detection and the quantification of lorazepam in human hair. The method involves decontamination of hair with dichloromethane, incubation in Soerensen buffer (pH 7.6) in the presence of lorazepam-d4, liquid-liquid extraction with diethylether-chloroform (80:20, v/v) at pH 8.4, derivatization by silylation and detection by GC-MS/NCI. The increasing concentrations of lorazepam from the end to the roots of a 16-cm-long hair strand (i.e. 31 pg/mg, 40 pg/mg and 49 pg/mg) proved that the driver had taken the drug over a long period of time.", 
    "6": "This investigation includes whole blood samples from 53 drug addicts found unconscious in the Copenhagen area with evidence of a heroin overdose. Heroin/morphine was detected in 85% of the patients and other opioids in 11%. One or more benzodiazepines, most often diazepam, were detected in 75% of the patients. A blood alcohol concentration higher than 1.00 mg/g was detected in 57% of the patients. Methadone was detected in seven patients, ketobemidone in four, amphetamine in five and cocaine in one. This investigation showed widespread multi-drug abuse and heroin/morphine alone was detected in only one patient. As indicators of heroin intake, 6-mono-acetylmorphine (MAM) and morphine were detected in this investigation.", 
    "7": "This study evaluated the bispectral index as an indicator of anesthetic depth in relation to the cardiovascular response to intubation. Two treatments were compared: group 1 (n = 8) received propofol for induction of anesthesia (2 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.20 mg/kg-1/min-1, group 2 (n = 8) was given 90 micrograms/kg midazolam 2 min before, followed by anesthesia with half-strength propofol (1 mg/kg bolus with infusion of 0.10 mg/kg-1/min-1). The bispectral index of the electroencephalogram, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured under unanesthetized conditions, during anesthetic induction, intubation, and a 15-min period after intubation. The duration of anesthesia and the total propofol requirement were recorded. Midazolam pretreatment produced transient decreases in blood pressure and the bispectral index. During anesthetic induction with propofol, blood pressure decreased 20% in both groups, and the bispectral index decreased to lower levels in group 1 (29 +/- 9) than in group 2 (47 +/- 22). Intubation increased blood pressure more in group 2 (50 +/- 10 mm Hg) than in group 1 (30 +/- 12 mm Hg). Throughout the rest of the surgery, more propofol was used in group 1 (77 +/- 14 micrograms/kg-1/min-1) than in group 2 (42 +/- 14 micrograms/kg-1/min-1). These results show that the decrease in bispectral index provides an indication of the blood pressure increase to intubation during propofol anesthesia. Midazolam pretreatment did not attenuate the cardiovascular response to intubation but did decrease propofol use during surgery.", 
    "8": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor ligands with varying intrinsic efficacies [RO19-4603, 0.02-0.15 mg/kg; FG 7142 1-16 mg/kg; DMCM, 1-8 mg/kg; RO16-6028 (bretazenil), 8-32 mg/kg] in modulating GABAergic activity were examined for the ability to alter palatability-induced ethanol (EtOH) intake in the alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) line of rats. NP rats on a 22-hour fluid-deprivation schedule were given 2-hour daily access to a 10% (v/v) EtOH/3% (g/v) polycose solution and water. Average EtOH intake was 2.1 +/- 0.2 g/kg/2 hours, and water intake was 17.1 +/- 0.9 ml/2 hours. During the initial 15 minutes of the 2-hour session, RO19-4603, the imidazothienodiazepine partial inverse agonist reduced EtOH intake to 19% of control values at 0.04 mg/kg and completely suppressed drinking of the EtOH solution at 0.15 mg/kg. Twenty-four-hour postdrug administration, the 0.08-mg/kg dose of RO19-4603 completely suppressed drinking of the EtOH solution at the 60-minute interval, and the 0.15-mg/kg dose reduced intake to 20% of control levels at the 15-minute interval. FG 7142, the partial beta-carboline inverse agonist reduced EtOH drinking at the 60-minute interval with the 1-mg/kg dose, and the 16-mg/kg dose reduced water intake at the 15-minute interval. DMCM, the full beta-carboline inverse agonist, significantly reduced water intake at 15 minutes (4 and 8 mg/kg), and the same doses caused a substantial increase in EtOH drinking at the 120-minute interval. The anxiolytic agent bretazenil (16 and 32 mg/kg) increased EtOH consumption during the initial 15 minutes to 270% to 425% of control levels, and water intake increased by the end of the 2-hour session to as much as 210% of control following administration of the 32-mg/kg dose. These findings support existing evidence suggesting that BDZ receptor ligands may modify neuronal processes that mediate some reinforcing and/or aversive properties of alcohol. They further demonstrate a potential importance of the GABAA-BDZ receptor complex in mediating palatability- (environmentally) induced EtOH drinking even in rats selectively bred for low alcohol preference.", 
    "9": "Aging-related alterations in both protein and mRNA expression of gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunits of the GABAA receptors have been observed in several brain areas of Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 rats. Subunit-specific antibodies to gamma 2S and gamma 2L as well as a riboprobe to the large intracellular loop of gamma 2, which recognizes both gamma 2S and gamma 2L mRNAs, in conjunction with computerized image analysis were used for quantitative immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. In addition, specific oligonucleotide probes to gamma 2S or gamma 2L mRNA were used for quantitative dot blot hybridization. A large increase in the number of heavily immunostained neurons with the anti-gamma 2L antibody was detected in the cerebral cortex (115%) of old rats. However, only a small (but significant) aging-related increase in the density of gamma 2L immunostaining (7%) was observed throughout the cerebral cortex whereas no significant aging-related change in gamma 2L mRNA was detected in this brain region. Contrary to gamma 2L, the gamma 2S immunostaining did not show aging-related increased number of heavily immunostained neurons in cerebral cortex. Moreover, the density of gamma 2S immunostaining and the expression of gamma 2S mRNA were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex (9-24%). Important aging-related changes were also found in the cerebellum of old rats where the expression of both gamma 2S and gamma 2L peptides was significantly decreased (24% and 23% respectively). This decrease in gamma 2 protein expression was accompanied by decreased expression of gamma 2S (16-38%) and gamma 2L (24%) mRNAs. Nevertheless, the most important decrease of gamma 2S (48%) and gamma 2L protein (20%) was revealed in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. In addition, the expression of gamma 2S protein was increased (14%) whereas the expression of gamma 2L was decreased (13%) in the granule cell layer. Therefore, the relative expression of gamma 2S protein in both layers was reversed in old animals. The observed aging-related changes in the expression of GABAA receptor subunits might lead to altered GABAA receptor/benzodiazepine receptor subunit composition.", 
    "10": "The expression of the gamma 2 subunit into functional GABAA receptors has been examined in the embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line P19, a pluripotent cell line which differentiates into a neuronal phenotype after exposure to retinoic acid. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were used to examine the characteristics of the GABA receptors expressed in P19 cells at different times after exposure to retinoic acid. Messenger RNA for both the gamma 2L and gamma 2S splice variants of the GABAA receptor increased dramatically following differentiation of P19 EC cells with retinoic acid. By 12 days after retinoic acid treatment, while both mRNAs were present, there was an approximately 10-fold greater abundance of gamma 2S mRNA compared to gamma 2L. However, at this same time point neurons derived from P19 cells stained intensely with a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide fragment specific for the gamma 2L subunit. A significant increase in both the affinity for GABA and the maximum current amplitude elicited by GABA occurred between 7 and 12 days after retinoic acid treatment. In contrast, the ability of the benzodiazepine agonist flurazepam to potentiate GABA-induced membrane current was the same at 7 and 12 days after retinoic acid treatment. These data suggest that the gamma 2 subunit of the GABAA receptor is expressed early following differentation of P19 cells into a neuronal phenotype, and that this subunit is incorporated into functional GABAA receptors. Moreover, the gamma 2S and gamma 2L splice variants of this subunit may be co-expressed in neurons derived from P19 cells. The observed affinity change for GABA may reflect a time-dependent change in the expression of alpha and/or beta subunits of the GABAA receptor, as occurs in developing neuronal tissue both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "11": "A demand for a quick and reliable diagnostics of acute and chronic poisonings with drugs of abuse, monitoring of the treatment of drug abusers and controlling their abstinence lead to a search for the most useful diagnostic methods for clinical aims and certification. Our observations concerning the importance of toxicological investigation, particularly the use of Triage rapid immunoassay, in the diagnostics of acute poisonings and the abstinence control of dependent people were presented. Urine of 418 poisoned people and 7 \"detoxificated' patients treated at the Department of Toxicology in Krak\u00f3w in the years 1991-1995 was examined, and in 54 cases Triage method was used (seven drugs of abuse were determined: amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates and tetrahydrocannabinoids), which was later confirmed using the Fluorescence Polarisation immunoassay, measured with the Vitalab Eclair. An increase in number of admitted patients to the Department of Toxicology was noted and the need for reliable diagnostics concerning the increasing number of cases in which inconsistency of the drug declared in the interview with the toxicological findings was stated. Triage method used in the examinations proved to be very useful for clinical diagnostics in quick determination of drugs of abuse in urine. The result should be confirmed using another, preferential method for the poison found in biological material.", 
    "12": "Heart rate, arterial blood pressure and blood acid-base status were determined in 18 adult female mink (mean (+/- SEM) body weight 1052 +/- 34 g) during long-term anaesthesia with either controlled ventilation (n=12) or spontaneous respiration (n=6). Surgical anaesthesia was induced by intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (Ketaminol Vet, 40.0 +/- 1.7 mg/kg) and midazolam hydrochloride (Dormicum 2.8 +/- 0.1 mg/kg) and maintained for at least 5 h by continuous intravenous infusion of this drug combination in 0.9% saline. For all animals, the mean rates of infusion of ketamine and midazolam were 48.4 +/- 1.6 and 1.61 +/- 0.12 mg/h, respectively. Following continuous infusion of the anaesthetics in isotonic saline, at a rate of 20 ml/h, a moderate 'dilution acidosis' developed, which could be corrected by replacement of part of the saline with sodium bicarbonate to a final concentration of approximately 25 mmol NaHCO3 per litre. However, when the animals were allowed to breathe spontaneously, an increase in heart rate and a combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis occurred, due to severe respiratory depression. Apart from these effects and a few cases of increased salivation, no adverse effects over time were observed on the arterial blood acid-base status and cardiovascular function of the animals during ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia. It is concluded that the procedure described for long-term anaesthesia in mink is convenient and safe for acute physiological experiments in this species, provided normal body temperature and pulmonary gas exchange is sufficiently maintained. Thus, the need for an adequately controlled artificial ventilation is strongly emphasized. Finally, a proposal for the composition of an intravenous solution, containing ketamine and midazolam hydrochloride, and sodium bicarbonate in saline, suitable for long-term anaesthesia in adult mink is presented.", 
    "13": "Wave-form analysis and detection of sleep spindles should be automatically performed to achieve objective and highly precise determination of the pattern of appearance of sleep spindles. The conditions for constructing the automatic analysis and detection are as follows: 1) it is recommended that EEGs be sampled at 500 Hz or higher intervals; 2) the digital filter with the threshold that is most appropriate for removal of artifacts should be used; 3) various conditions for the analysis and detection of wave-forms are widely used; and 4) a procedure for inspecting and reading record paper should also be included in the set-up. Taking these points into consideration, the authors developed an automatic analysis system for sleep spindles, which employs a computer. The system was applied to a case preliminarily treated with a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, ethyl loflazepate (CM6912). The assessment using this system revealed that the CM6912 administration induced an increase in sleep spindles, delayed frequency, and caused amplitude increases and a prolonged duration.",

Good symptom relief was maintained without rapid or high escalation of doses of morphine or sedatives. Personal function was maintained in at least a moderate degree in the majority of patients. This study also illustrates some of the difficulties in describing and evaluating the concept of \"dying with dignity\".",

The incidence of self-reported depressive symptoms was evaluated using a modified version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Rating Scale (CES-D). The incidence of depressive symptoms in subjects newly exposed to corticosteroids and sedative-hypnotics was compared to that of a nonexposed comparison cohort.", 
    "17": "The incidence of self-reported depressive symptoms was elevated in subjects newly exposed to corticosteroids (Risk Ratio = 3.10), although the association did not attain statistical significance (p = .07). The risk ratio for sedative-hypnotic exposure was 4.18, a statistically significant finding (p = .02). As expected, incident self-reported depressive symptoms were also associated with several psychosocial variables. However, the data did not suggest that the observed associations between drug exposures and depressive symptoms were due to confounding by psychosocial or illness-related variables.", 
    "18": "Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of alprazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.) on the development of autochthonous tumors induced by the Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV) in BALB/c female mice subjected to stress. Enhancement of MSV-induced tumor incidence and growth was observed, together with a delay in the usual prompt regression of the tumors, when programmed white sound anxiety-stress was administered immediately following MSV i.m. inoculation. However, a depressant effect on tumor size and incidence was observed when stress was administered before virus inoculation. Treatment with alprazolam was found to reverse partially the adverse effects of postinoculation stress, and also to inhibit the beneficial effects of the preinoculation administration of stress on tumor development. Pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg s.c.), a central benzodiazepine antagonist, resulted in a suppression on both effects of alprazolam in stressed mice.",

He required opiates for pain management and benzodiazepines for anxiety associated with dressing changes. The narcotics compromised his pulmonary function and level of consciousness, and interfered with several attempts to wean him from ventilator support. Intravenous ketorolac instead of narcotics before dressing changes alleviated the respiratory depression and returned his partial pressure of carbon dioxide-mediated respiratory drive to normal. With these changes, including changes in respiratory rate to tidal volume, he was successfully weaned from ventilatory support. In addition, the patient's level of consciousness improved. These changes increased his participation in his daily physical therapy sessions.", 
    "21": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) may result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, sweating, tremors, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, delirium, hallucinations, seizures, and death beginning 6 hours after alcohol cessation in alcoholics. Benzodiazepines are cross-tolerant with ethanol and are considered first-line therapy for treating AWS. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are first metabolized by hepatic oxidation, then glucuronidation. Lorazepam and oxazepam undergo only hepatic glucuronidation. Benzodiazepine oxidation is decreased in persons with liver disease and the elderly. Accumulation with resultant excessive sedation and respiratory depression may be significant when administering chlordiazepoxide or diazepam to patients with impaired oxidative metabolism. Lorazepam and oxazepam metabolism is minimally affected by age and liver disease. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are erratically absorbed by the intramuscular route. Lorazepam is predictably absorbed by the intramuscular route. Oxazepam is not available in parenteral form. Lorazepam appears to be the safest empiric choice among the various benzodiazepines for treating AWS in the elderly and in patients with liver disease, or those who require therapy by the intramuscular route.",

There were 14 symptomatic cases of which 11 were determined to be related to mistletoe exposure. There were six gastrointestinal upset, two mild drowsiness, one eye irritation, one ataxia (21 months), one seizure (13 months). Treatments included gastrointestinal decontamination in 54 patients (59%), ocular irrigation in one and IV benzodiazepine in one. Decontamination did not appear to affect outcome. Amount ingested ranged from one berry or leaf to more than 20 berries or five leaves. In cases with a known amount ingested, eight of ten cases with > or = 5 berries remained symptom free. In the 11 cases with leaf-only ingestion (range 1-5 leaves), three patients had gastrointestinal upset. The one case with five leaves ingested remained asymptomatic.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that a further 20% to 30% of patients will have only a partial response. There are four main options to consider in the treatment of these patients: optimization, substitution, augmentation, and combination therapy. Several combination antidepressant treatments have been used in treatment-refractory depression. Moreover, various augmentation strategies have also proved to be successful. Although the empirical data to support these treatment options are limited, augmentation treatment has several potential advantages over the other clinical options available, particularly substitution. These data are reviewed and clinical applications discussed. Particular attention is paid to the role of anxiolytics as augmentation agents in the treatment of major depression.",

This article provides guidelines to differentiate transient from persistent anxiety states, a distinction that has important treatment implications. Psychosocial support and coping skills training to maintain abstinence are recommended for treatment of transient anxiety states. The use of medication should be reserved for persistent anxiety states. Recent placebo-controlled trials of buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, suggest that this medication may help to retain anxious alcoholics in treatment and to reduce anxiety symptoms and heavy drinking.

    "32": "The efficacy of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil has been assessed clinically in a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre study in patients with grade I-III portosystemic encephalopathy. In an ancillary study reported here the effect of flumazenil on the electroencephalogram (EEG) was analysed in 32 patients who had EEG grading according to protocol. Following the baseline observation period, patients were randomised to receive (at 1 min interval) 3 sequential bolus injections of flumazenil (0.4, 0.8 and 1 mg) or placebo followed by infusions of flumazenil (1 mg/h) or placebo for 3 h. Patients were monitored for 5 h after infusion. A positive response was defined as 1 point improvement in EEG grade. After independent analysis of the EEG gradings 5 out of 17 (29%) flumazenil treated patients showed an improvement in EEG grading (3 after bolus, 2 during follow-up) compared to 2 out of 15 (13%) placebo treated patients (1 after bolus, 1 during follow-up) (95% confidence interval of difference: -12% to + 50%). Of the 5 EEG responders after flumazenil, 3 also had an improvement in clinical PSE grading (none after bolus, 2 during infusion, 1 during follow-up), compared to neither of the 2 EEG responders after placebo. EEg responders did not differ from non-responders with respect to Child-Pugh score, basal EEG, PSE grade and positivity for benzodiazepines. In conclusion, treatment perspectives for flumazenil in portosystemic encephalopathy appear to be present for only a minority of patients; however, this study yields no support for a major role of benzodiazepine antagonists in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "33": "The responsibility of psychotropic drugs as a cause of road traffic accidents remains difficult to evaluate with precision. Different studies performed in many countries provide a certain precision in relation to percentage of injured drivers whose blood contained psychotropic substances (8 to 10% according to studies). On the other hand, it is practically impossible to really know either these products were or were not the cause of the accidents because underlying or associated pathologies can equally create problems such as lack of attention and other vigilance deficits. There is also a possibility of suicidal or aggressive tendencies. A certain number of circadian and other chronobiological parameters also complicate the problem since the schedule (hour) as well as the day of the week or even the season can considerably modify vigilance and reaction time. Available medications able to create such problems are numerous and their mechanisms of action varied. They can influence vision, impulsiveness and vigilance. They can act either by direct mechanisms of sedation or, on the contrary, by raising inhibition through secondary mechanisms: delay in drug elimination or provoked insomnia. For the most part, incriminated medications belong to the different classes of sedative medicines: benzodiazepines, antiepileptics, some antihistaminic agents, some antidepressants, some thymo-regulators and some anti-hypertensives. Also included are desinhibitors or stimulant classes: amphetamines and related drugs, caffeine and codeine. Some of them can be used for their psychodysleptic properties: codeine and anticholinergic drugs. Finally, drug and medicinal associations can have unforeseen effects: for example, anticholinergics + alcohol + valpromide, etc. If it appears methodologically impossible that research could ever precisely quantify the share of responsibility of psychotropic drugs in causing road traffic accidents, this relation remains highly probable. It is therefore necessary that in the course of university and post-academic training, potential prescribers might regularly be advised of these risks. Lastly, public needs to be constantly informed.", 
    "34": "Managing agitation in critically ill patients is challenging and complex. Advances in the field of critical care impose strains on patients that can lead to disorientation and agitation, especially as more severe illnesses are treated successfully. Although the adverse effects of agitation are well-known, their impact on morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and cost are only beginning to be addressed. Meeting these challenges requires an understanding of the potential adverse effects of agitation, its causes and contributing factors, the advantages and limitations of available pharmacologic agents, and the role of nonpharmacologic interventions. This article reviews each of these issues, with a focus on clinical applications and strategies.", 
    "35": "As a result of more offensive therapeutic measures and the given abilities of modern medicine and the increasing number of geriatric patients who are characterized by multimorbidity, more perioperative complications, in particular those of cardiac origin, can be expected. As in any other medical discipline, the safety of anaesthesiological care of the patient very much depends on the individual professional qualification and competence of the physician. For the field of anaesthesiology it can be concluded that it is necessary to tackle the specific problems of this risk group in order to reduce the rate of complications to a minimum. In line with a number of studies showing equal manifestation of cardiac risk factors during the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods, we should concentrate on the consistent use of all preventive and therapeutic measures available during these three periods. Besides evaluation of the cardiac risk factors and planning of the intra- and postoperative management, premedication is of particular importance in the preoperative period. To avoid sympathicoadrenergic contraregulations, benzodiazepines are particularly recommended because of their anxiolytic and sedative effects. The selection of a special anaesthetic method suitable for the patient with high cardiac risk should be influenced not only by anaesthesiological aspects but also by the complex effects of anaesthetic drugs on the determinants of the myocardial oxygen balance. In this connection, an increased sympathicoadrenergic tonus is of particular importance, i.e. extreme changes in blood pressure or heart rate--compared to preanaesthetic values--and an increase in diastolic wall tension should be avoided. An anaesthetic regime comprising gentle general anaesthesia combined with epidural block and small doses of opioids or local anaesthetics meets these requirements, as does a combination of opioids with low doses of volatile anaesthetics or intravenous hypnotics. The quality of perioperative management is also strongly determined by careful haemodynamic monitoring and early correction of circulatory disturbances. Since cardiac patients remain at risk up to three days after surgery, a level of haemodynamic monitoring appropriate to the level of cardiac risk must be maintained. Three main symptoms--increasing oxygen uptake (as a product of pain or shivering), hypoventilation and hypoxaemia--should be avoided in the postoperative period. Therefore, respiratory insufficiency should be diagnosed without fail by respiratory monitoring. If required, artificial ventilation must be continued, with particular attention being given to circulatory effects during artificial ventilation and weaning from the ventilator.", 
    "36": "A common action of many antidepressants is the inhibition of the reuptake of the biogenic amines norepinephrine, serotonin (5-HT) and/or dopamine into nerve terminals. Another postulated mechanism of action for many antidepressants is the downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors postsynaptically after chronic administration. Many antidepressants have been reported to produce changes in the regulation of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors chronically. None of these mechanisms is completely satisfactory as a common antidepressant mechanism of action. Is it possible to unify these hypotheses of antidepressant action? A number of receptor changes have been recognized in depression. Usually, these implicated receptors are linked to a G protein. Thus, it could be hypothesized that depression may be the result of a disorder of the large family of receptor-linked G proteins. Depression, a disorder in which there seems to be an important genetic component, could be expressed in either the receptor or in the G proteins, leading to a defective linkage between the receptor and the G protein, resulting in abnormal transduction mechanisms. The concept of antidepressants is changing rapidly as these agents appear with new therapeutic indications other than depression, such as panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc. It can be expected that the presently available antidepressants might eventually be considered anxiolytics or that benzodiazepines and 5-HT1A agonists could come to be viewed as disinhibiting substances.", 
    "37": "To determine the physiological factors and medications predicting injurious falls among the elderly population, the authors conducted a prospective study in a rural home-dwelling population aged 70 years or over, initially 979 persons (377 men and 602 women), from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1992, in Northern Finland. The independent risk factors for all falling injuries, falls leading to minor injuries and ones leading to major injuries were determined. In men, the independent risk factors for all injuries were gait disturbances [odds ratio (OR) = 3.5] and the use of digitalis (OR = 2.2), those for minor injuries were gait disturbances (OR = 2.7) and the use of calcium blockers (OR = 3.0), and those for major injuries were the absence of a quadriceps reflex (OR = 4.8), gait disturbances (OR = 2.8) and the use of digitalis (OR = 2.9). In women, the corresponding independent risk factors were short step length (OR = 32.1), the use of calcium blockers (OR = 2.5) and the use of medications for improving peripheral circulation (OR = 3.7) for all injurious falls, path deviation (OR = 2.3) the use of calcium blockers (OR = 2.8) and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs (OR = 2.1) for minor injuries, and foot deformity (OR = 2.0), short step length (OR = 15.8), the use of long-acting benzodiazepines (OR = 4.0) and the use of calcium blockers (OR = 2.4) for major injuries. In order to prevent injurious falls, attention should be given to the prescription of tranquillizers, cardiovascular medications and anti-inflammatory drugs. The walking abilities of elderly people should be maintained and chronic diseases leading to peripheral neuropathy should be treated adequately.", 
    "38": "Serum samples from five critically ill patients were incubated with microsomes prepared from three human livers. The activity of cytochrome P450 3A4 was assessed by measuring the disappearance of midazolam and the appearance of 1-hydroxy midazolam in the incubates. Significant inhibition of the ability of this enzyme to metabolise midazolam was seen. This occurred in incubates containing serum samples from critically ill patients and not in those containing serum from two normal volunteers. The mechanism of this inhibition is unknown, but several possibilities are discussed.",

This study compares anterograde amnesic effects of midazolam with hydroxyzine in children undergoing dental treatment with those drugs plus nitrous oxide, using a recall test. Thirty ASAI children 24-28 months, were shown a Standard-Binet intelligence scale-memory for objects subtest before entering treatment room. Twenty-lone randomly determined children received 3.7 mg/kg hydroxyzine 45 min before treatment or 0.2 mg/kg intranasal midazolam in two succeeding appointments, alternatively. Recall in the 30-subject treatment group was 90%. Recall in the 21-subject treatment group was 71% for hydroxyzine and 29% for midazolam. Midazolam was more effective in creating amnesia than hydroxyzine in this study.", 
    "44": "The primary requirement of cells in a liver support system is the preservation of the in vivo metabolic functions that prevent or decrease the progress of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) by providing interim support to liver failure patients. While rodent hepatocytes offer a model for liver assist device (LAD) research, their limited number per animal prohibits direct scale up to human devices. Healthy human liver cells are seldom available in adequate numbers to support clinical LAD use; consequently, a large animal source of liver cells is needed. The study presented here explored the potential of porcine hepatocytes to proliferate and maintain metabolic function in vitro. Porcine hepatocytes were isolated from approximately 12 kg swine by a modification of Seglen's method. Hepatocytes cultured up to 10 days were shown to metabolize ammonia and maintain both Phase I and II detoxification functions. In addition, the cultures showed proliferative activity both as an increase in total protein content and by thymidine incorporation. Immunocytochemical staining identified cell proliferation through Day 4 to be primarily hepatocytes while Days 6 and 10 showed nonparenchymal cells to be increasing. The detoxification functions measured showed peak activity on Day 4 and gradually declined through Day 10. The ability of porcine hepatocytes to proliferate and maintain a diversity of hepatic functions in culture strongly suggests their potential for use as the biological component of artificial LADs.", 
    "45": "A cohort of 289 children with febrile convulsions who had been randomised in early childhood to either intermittent prophylaxis (diazepam at fever) or no prophylaxis (diazepam at seizures) was followed up 12 years later. The study focused on the occurrence of epilepsy and on neurological, motor, intellectual, cognitive, and scholastic achievements in the cohort. At follow up the two groups were of almost identical age (14.0 v 14.1 years), body weight (58.2 v 57.2 kg), height (168.2 v 167.7 cm), and head circumference (55.9 v 56.2 cm). The occurrence of epilepsy (0.7% v 0.8%), neurological examination, fine and gross motor development on the Stott motor test, intellectual performance on the Wechsler intelligence scale for children verbal IQ (105 v 105), performance IQ (114 v 111), and full scale IQ (110 v 108), cognitive abilities on a neuropsychological test battery, including short and long term, auditory and visual memory, visuomotor tempo, computer reaction time, reading test, and scholastic achievement were also very similar. Children with simple and complex febrile convulsions had the same benign outcome. The long term prognosis in terms of subsequent epilepsy, neurological, motor, intellectual, cognitive, and scholastic ability was not influenced by the type of treatment applied in early childhood. Preventing new febrile convulsions appears no better in the long run than abbreviating them.",

The validation is based on a sleep recording set of 60 subjects (33 males and 27 females), consisting of three groups: 20 normal controls subjects, 20 depressed patients and 20 insomniac patients treated with a benzodiazepine. The inter-expert variability estimated from these 60 recordings (61,949 epochs) indicated an average agreement rate of 87.5% between two experts on the basis of 30-second epochs. The automatic scoring system, compared in the same way with one expert, achieved an average agreement rate of 82.3%, without expert supervision. By adding expert supervision for ambiguous and unknown epochs, detected by computation of an uncertainty index and unknown rejection, the automatic/expert agreement grew from 82.3% to 90%, with supervision over only 20% of the night. Bearing in mind the composition and the size of the test sample, the automated sleep staging system achieved a satisfactory performance level and may be considered a useful alternative to visual sleep stage scoring for large-scale investigations of human sleep.", 
    "51": "Several findings suggest that serotonin dysfunction may play at least a partial role in the etiology of social phobia. The cortisol response to fenfluramine, a serotonin agonist, is enhanced in patients with social phobia. Serotonin may be a common denominator between the blushing commonly seen in social phobics and the cutaneous flushing occurring in patients with carcinoid syndrome, although this is unlikely. Drugs that have demonstrated effectiveness in social phobia include the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), clonazepam (a benzodiazepine that potentiates serotonin function and synthesis), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (which block the oxidative deamination of serotonin), and beta-adrenoceptor blockers (which control the synthesis of melatonin from serotonin). A variety of beta-blockers, some acting centrally and some peripherally, have been effective in the treatment of performance anxiety, a specific form of social phobia.", 
    "52": "Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most common neurologic emergencies in children, adolescents, and young adults. SE may be due to acute neurologic conditions such as meningitis, encephalitis, or stroke, complicated febrile seizures, intractable epilepsy, degenerative diseases, intoxication, or may be the first manifestation of epilepsy. Initial treatment of convulsive SE is usually with an intravenous benzodiazepine (BZD) [lorazepam (LZP) or diazepam (DZP)], phenobarbital (PB), or phenytoin (PHT). LZP is less likely to cause respiratory depression than DZP and is therefore preferred. Sequelae and risk for recurrence of SE are primarily related to the underlying cause. Refractory SE (RSE) is most often symptomatic of an acute neurologic condition or neurodegenerative disease. Treatment for RSE is difficult, usually requiring intensive support of vital functions. Reported treatments for RSE include very high dose PB, continuous infusions of pentobarbital or BZDs (DZP, midazolam), lidocaine, inhalation anesthesia, and propofol. Outcome is related to underlying cause. Nonconvulsive SE may present as confusion or may mimic psychiatric illness. Response to BZDs is usually rapid but may not be sustained. Rapid initiation of oral or rectal valproate may be useful. Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) is almost always due to an acute or chronic destructive lesion. Surgical treatment may be the only effective modality in some children with EPC. Acute treatment of breakthrough seizures and clusters of seizures at home with rectal BZDs (usually DZP, 0.2-0.5 mg/kg) may prevent progression to SE in some children and adolescents and reduce the need for visits to emergency facilities.", 
    "53": "A long period of clinical latency before development of symptoms is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. OM10.1, a promyelocyte cell line latently infected with HIV-1, has been developed as a model for studying the mechanism of viral latency and the activation of virus expression. We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production without addition of any cytokines. The mechanism of activation was analyzed by using anti-TNF-alpha antibody and various inhibitors. Although the TNF-alpha level in culture supernatants was below the sensitivity of an ELISA assay system, addition of anti-TNF-alpha antibody in culture medium could partially suppress the heat shock induced HIV-1 production. Staurosporine (PKC inhibitor), pentoxifylline (NF-kappa B inhibitor), and Ro5-3335 (HIV-1 Tat inhibitor) also inhibited significantly the heat shock induced virus activation. In particular, staurosporine achieved approximately 90% inhibition of the HIV-1 antigen expression in heat shock-treated OM10.1 at a non-toxic concentration. Although the mechanism of HIV-1 activation with heat shock has not been fully elucidated yet, it is presumed PKC plays an important role in HIV-1 activation. Thus, the present observations will provide a further insight into the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infections.", 
    "54": "It is widely accepted that cerebral acetylcholine is necessary for learning and memory, but little is known about the type of muscarinic receptors involved in these functions. To investigate this problem, [3H]-N-methyl-scopolamine which binds to different types of muscarinic receptors, [3H]-Pirenzepine an M1 receptor antagonist, and [3H]-Oxotremorine-M which binds mainly to M2 receptors, were used as ligands to look for possible changes in muscarinic receptor density in neostriatum (NEO), hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY), and temporo-parietal neocortex (CTX), after testing for retention of inhibitory avoidance, trained with high or low footshock intensities. After low reinforcement there was an M1 postsynaptic receptor up-regulation in NEO, HIP, and CTX, and an M2 presynaptic receptor down-regulation in HIP, which suggests a concerted pre- and postsynaptic cholinergic activation in this area. An up-regulation of both M1 and M2 receptors was detected in CTX of low and high footshocked animals, which indicates the presence of a cortical postsynaptic M2 receptor.", 
    "55": "The presence of [3H] NBMPR binding sites in the mitochondrial fraction of rat testis is described. The dissociation constant (KD) from saturation studies was 0.16 +/- 0.04 nM.

    "60": "What are the neural substrates of food reward? Are reward and pleasure identical? Can taste pleasure be assessed in animals? Is reward necessarily conscious? These questions have re-emerged in recent years, and there is now sufficient evidence to prompt re-examination of many preconceptions concerning reward and its relation to brain systems. This paper reviews evidence from many sources regarding both the psychological structure of food reward and the neural systems that mediate it. Special attention is paid to recent evidence from \"tasty reactivity\" studies of affective reactions to food. I argue that this evidence suggests the following surprising possibilities regarding the functional components and brain substrates of food reward. (1) Reward contains distinguishable psychological or functional components--\"liking\" (pleasure/palatability) and \"wanting\" (appetite/incentive motivation). These can be manipulated and measured separately. (2) Liking and wanting have separable neural substrates. Mediation of liking related to food reward involves neurotransmitter systems such as opioid and GABA/benzodiazepine systems, and anatomical structures such as ventral pallidum and brainstem primary gustatory relays. Mediation of wanting related to food reward involves mesotelencephalic dopamine systems, and divisions of nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Both liking and wanting arise from vastly distributed neural systems, but the two systems are separable. (3) Neural processing of food reward is not confined to the limbic forebrain. Aspects of food reward begin to be processed in the brainstem. A neural manipulation can enhance reward or produce aversion but no single lesion or transection is likely abolish all properties of food reward. (4) Both wanting and liking can exist without subjective awareness. Conscious experience can distort or blur the underlying reward process that gave rise to it. Subjective reports may contain false assessments of underlying processes, or even fail at all to register important reward processes. The core processes of liking and wanting that constitute reward are distinct from the subjective report or conscious awareness of those processes.", 
    "61": "Although glia are known to be sensitive to exogenously applied neurotransmitter substances, little is known about how glia respond to neuronal activity on the millisecond time scale of individual synaptic events. We have explored the electrophysiological effects of excitatory neuronal signaling on glial cells in rat hippocampal microcultures. Exogenous applications of glutamate analogs to islands of glia revealed a large ionotropic AMPA receptor-mediated current and a smaller current mediated by electrogenic glutamate uptake. Glia demonstrated no evidence of NMDA or metabotropic receptor-mediated currents or membrane conductance changes. Despite the dominant contribution of AMPA receptors to exogenous glutamate applications in glia, AMPA receptor currents contributed only approximately 20% to the response of glia to endogenous glutamate release from solitary excitatory neurons. Electrogenic glutamate uptake contributed strongly to glial responses to neuronal stimulation. In addition, some glia exhibited a residual current is response to neuronal stimulation that was not attributable to calcium-dependent transmitter release or to neuronal potassium efflux. These results help provide a context for understanding the role of glial transporters and receptors in nervous system signaling.", 
    "62": "Flunitrazepam (FNZ) (4mg), an intermediate type benzodiazepine (BDZ) hypnotic, was administered orally to five healthy male subjects (Ss) for seven consecutive nights. Sleep EEG from the baseline night (BLN), the initial drug night (IDN), the fourth and the seventh drug nights (4DN, 7DN) was subjected to fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. During NREM sleep of 4DN and 7DN the sigma band (11.0-12.5 Hz) activity was similarly enhanced in every S. In REM of 4DN and 7DN beta band (23.0-29.0 Hz) was enhanced, but with larger variations among Ss. High intra-individual consistency of the relative EEG power patterns on 4DN and 7DN was observed. These results suggest that 1) EEG responses to FNZ are different in sleep states; explorations of these differences may provide better understandings of sleep mechanisms, and 2) individual variations in EEG responses may reflect individual variations of the BDZ receptor system. These methods may be useful for exploring receptor changes in neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "63": "Controversy over using benzodiazepines in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive population to relieve sleep and anxiety has not been addressed in the literature. Serious problems with diazepam abuse emerged in a psychiatric outpatient clinic for a predominately HIV-positive and illicit drug-using population, which led to a review of patient characteristics and prescribing policies and to a systematic problem-solving effort. The patients originally prescribed diazepam were significantly more likely to be on methadone and have histories of intravenous drug use compared with the patients not on benzodiazepines. Thus, the patients asking for diazepam are likely to have histories of substance abuse and have a high potential for abusing the medication. The authors found that diazepam can be discontinued without causing a significantly greater drop-out rate in that group.", 
    "64": "The objective of this study was to assess benzodiazepine use and the treatment of depression before admission to an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit in a sample of elderly patients. The study design was a retrospective chart review, and the setting was a university hospital inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit. The subjects included 131 consecutively admitted patients. Preadmission benzodiazepine drug regimens were reviewed in relation to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) guidelines for benzodiazepine use in nursing homes and in relation to psychiatric diagnoses. Psychiatric diagnoses were made based on DSM-III-R criteria. The preadmission benzodiazepine regimens of 38 of 59 patients receiving benzodiazepines (64.0%) were outside the HCFA guidelines. Also, 30 of 76 patients (39.5%) with depressive disorders received benzodiazepines as sole treatment of depression prior to their admission. This study suggests that benzodiazepines may be misused in the elderly and indicates the need for education and research on the appropriate use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of depression.", 
    "65": "A retrospective cohort study was conducted in individuals 65 years of age and older using Medicaid-reimbursed claims to assess the risk of hip fracture in users of two sedative-hypnotic drugs, triazolam and temazepam. Using the triazolam cohort as the referent group, the rate ratio was 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.17) for hip fracture with temazepam. Stratifying by age, sex, race, residence, time enrolled in Medicaid, prescription number, combinations of these, and several other potential confounding variables did not materially change the results. Compared with the short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic temazepam, use of triazolam, an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic, did not decrease the risk of hip fracture. This study did not determine that either drug, compared with no use in an insomniac control group, increases the risk of hip fracture. However, because sedative-hypnotic drugs have been found in other studies to increase the risk of falling and hip fracture, they should be used with caution, especially in the elderly.", 
    "66": "Adult rat offspring earlier exposed to maternally ingested caffeine during both gestation and lactation were observed in an open field following acute administration of diazepam or cyclohexyladenosine. While both drugs reduced measures of locomotion and emotional reactivity, caffeine-exposed rats showed evidence of greater sensitivity to cyclohexyladenosine (but not diazepam) as determined by its effects on grooming behavior and tendencies to occupy the center squares of the apparatus. This suggested that adenosine (A1) rather than benzodiazepine receptor activity had been affected by the perinatal caffeine experience which also reduced locomotor activity while increasing center occupancy. The acute effects of diazepam and cyclohexyladenosine also depended largely on the sex of the subjects. Diazepam affected locomotor activity more and both drugs affected defecation less in females than in males. No other interaction involving sex was significant.", 
    "67": "Thieno-triazolodiazepines WEB 2086 and BN 50739 have been described as the potent PAF receptor antagonists. Binding of radiolabeled [3H]WEB 2086 has been widely employed to characterize PAF receptors in different cells. In a search for a PAF receptor in isolated rat hepatocytes, we discovered that the binding of [3H]WEB to rat hepatocytes was highly specific but had a relatively low affinity with a Kd of 113 nM and Bmax of 0.65 pmol/10(6) cells in freshly isolated cell suspension and Kd of 1.65 muM and Bmax of 2.0 pmol/plate in cultured hepatocytes. No consistent specific binding of [3H]PAF itself was found in the same cell preparations. The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the presence of the peripheral type of benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 5-4864 was saturated and exhibited a K(i) of 3.8 nM and Bmax of 3.5 pmol/plate. The central type of benzodiazepine receptor antagonist clonazepam was competed for the [3H]flunitrazepam binding, however with a much lower affinity. Various antagonists inhibited the binding of [3H]WEB 2086 with a rank order BN 50739>Ro 5-4864 > or = clonazepam. Interestingly, bicuculline, specific antagonist of GABA(A) recognition sites, also significantly reduced the binding of [3H]WEB 2086. The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was inhibited with a rank potency BN 50739>WEB 2086. Taken together, these findings suggest that the specific binding of PAF receptor antagonists WEB 2086 and BN 50739 in rat hepatocytes does not involve PAF receptors and occurs via peripheral benzodiazepine and, possibly GABA(A) receptor sites.", 
    "68": "Imaging cerebral GABAA receptor density (GRD) with single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and iodine-123 iomazenil is highly accurate in lateralizing epileptogenic foci in patients with complex partial seizures of temporal origin. Limited knowledge exists on how iomazenil SPET compares with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this regard. We present a patient with complex partial seizures in whom MRI had identified an arachnoid cyst anterior to the tip of the left temporal lobe. Contralaterally to this structural abnormality, interictal electroencephalography (EEG) performed after sleep deprivation disclosed an intermittent frontotemporal dysrhythmic focus with slow and sharp waves. On iomazenil SPET images GRD was significantly reduced in the right temporal lobe and thus contralaterally to the MRI abnormality, but ipsilaterally to the pathological EEG findings. These data suggest that iomazenil SPET may significantly contribute to the presurgical evaluation of epileptic patients even when MRI identifies potentially epileptogenic structural lesions.", 
    "69": "The benzodiazepine receptor ligand iomazenil was labelled with carbon-11 to allow a direct positron emission tomography/single-photon emission tomography (PET/SPET) comparison with the well-known iodine-123 labelled compound. Imaging showed the same regional distribution for both modalities. Blood sample activity was corrected for metabolites by extraction with chloroform and high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis. Metabolism is very fast: 5min after application more than 85% of the plasma activity is present as hydrophilic metabolites. Kinetic methods were used to obtain regional estimates of transport rate constants and receptor concentrations. A three-compartment model was employed which gave transport rate constants for brain uptake (K1) and the distribution volume for the specifically receptor bound compartment (DVS). K1 varied from 0.32 to 0.50ml/min per gram for the cortical regions, cerebellum, thalamus and striatum for PET and SPET. Mean DVS-PET and DVS-SPET values were, respectively, 23+/-5 and 31+/-5ml/g for the occipital cortex, 11+/-3 and 15+/-2ml/g for the cerebellum, 7+/-2 and 11+/-3ml/g for the thalamus, 5+/-3 and 10+/-3ml/g for the striatum, and 3+/-2 and 3+/-1ml/g for the pons. These values correlated very well individually. The coefficient of variation of the SPET parameters was quite comparable to that of the PET parameters, especially after 180min (PET 90min) study duration. Thus quantitative benzodiazepine receptor information can be obtained from dynamic SPET imaging in the same way as with PET.", 
    "70": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used to study the effects of anesthetic and analgesic drugs on central nervous system function. A prospective study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of various EEG parameters for assessing midazolam-induced sedation during regional anesthesia.", 
    "71": "Twenty-six consenting adult patients were administered 4.5-20 mg intravenous midazolam (in increments of 0.5-1 mg bolus doses every 6-10 min) until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The EEG was continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (FP1-Cz and FP2-Cz) to obtain the bispectral index (BI), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), median frequency (MF), and delta, theta, alpha, and beta power bands. Sedation was assessed clinically at 6-10-min intervals using the Observers' Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response (unconsciousness) to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. The EEG parameters were correlated with the OAA/S scores using nonparametric Spearman's rank-correlation analysis. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used to determine significant changes in EEG parameters during the onset of and recovery from midazolam-induced sedation.", 
    "72": "Of the EEG parameters studied, the BI exhibited the best correlation with OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's Rho = 0.815) and recovery (Spearman's Rho = 0.596) phases. With increasing sedation, there was a progressive decrease in the BI (OAA/S score of 5: BI = 95.4 +/- 2.3; 4: 90.3 +/- 4.5; 3:86.6 +/- 4.6; 2:75.6 +/- 9.7; 1:69.2 +/- 13.9). A similar pattern was found for the 95% SEF as the OAA/S score decreased from 4 to 1. Similarly, EEG-BI increased with recovery from the sedative effects of midazolam (OAA/S score = 2:BI = 75.2 +/- 10.2; 3:82.3 +/- 7.3; 4:90.8 +/- 6). However, no consistent changes were found with the other EEG parameters. The mean EEG values between OAA/S scores 3 and 2 and between OAA/S scores 2 and 1 during the onset and recovery phases from midazolam-induced sedation, defined as EEG50 values for response to verbal command (EEG50-VC) and to shaking of the head (EEG50-SH), were 79.3 +/- 8 and 70.8 +/- 14.3, respectively, for EEG-BI. The EEG-BI displayed the smallest coefficients of variation for the EEG50-VC and EEG50-SH values.", 
    "73": "The EEG-BI appears to be a useful parameter for assessing midazolam-induced sedation and can predict the likelihood of a patient responding to verbal commands or to shaking of the head during midazolam-induced sedation.", 
    "74": "Benzothiadiazides such as cyclothiazide potentiate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor responses, whereas 2,3-benzodiazepines such as 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4 -dihydro- 5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53655) act as noncompetitive antagonists; both drugs act through allosteric modulation. Controversy exists as to whether cyclothiazide and GYKI 53655 act at a common site. Recent mutational analysis has led to the identification of a serine residue in flip splice variants that is critical for directing the interaction of cyclothiazide with AMPA receptors. We tested whether the mutation of this residue to glutamine, which abolishes potentiation by cyclothiazide, can in addition block antagonism by 2,3-benzodiazepines, as would be predicted for action at a common site. We found that the S to Q mutation does not alter antagonism by 2,3-benzodiazepines, suggesting that the molecular determinants directing the interaction between GYKI 53655 and AMPA receptors are not identical to those controlling sensitivity to cyclothiazide. Additional support for this was obtained from analysis of the responses of AMPA receptor flip/flop splice variants, which, despite differences in equilibrium desensitization and sensitivity to cyclothiazide, show only small differences in sensitivity to 2,3-benzodiazepines. Furthermore, introduction of the flip exon from GluRA into GluR6, conferred sensitivity to cyclothiazide but did not increase sensitivity to 2,3-benzodiazepines. Of interest, experiments with native AMPA receptors generated from hippocampal and forebrain poly(A)+ mRNA revealed greater sensitivity to 2,3-benzodiazepines than receptors generated by expression of recombinant AMPA receptors, possibly indicating the existence of an unidentified accessory protein or novel receptor subunit.", 
    "75": "The effects of cyclothiazide on the properties of (R,S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors were studied using equilibrium binding techniques and interactions with other compounds known to modulate the receptors. Cyclothiazide caused a reduction in [3H]AMPA binding in assays carried out in the presence of thiocyanate, a chaotropic ion that markedly increases the affinity of AMPA receptors and accelerates their desensitization. In the absence of thiocyanate, however, cyclothiazide had no reliable effect on the binding of [3H]AMPA or on the affinity for this agonist assessed from the displacement of [3H]CNQX. The interaction of cyclothiazide with the receptor appears not to be changed by the presence of thiocyanate. Analysis of the results with a kinetic model of the AMPA receptor suggests that cyclothiazide does not block receptor desensitization by making the desensitized state inaccessible but rather by stabilizing the active state, i.e., by increasing the affinity of the latter to a point where it becomes energetically more favorable than the desensitized state. GYKI 52466, an atypical benzodiazepine that blocks AMPA receptor-gated currents, did not reverse the changes in binding affinity produced by cyclothiazide in the presence of thiocyanate. Physiological experiments conducted in excised patches collected from hippocampal pyramidal cells indicated that thiocyanate does not block access of GYKI 52466 to AMPA receptors. These results point to the conclusion that cyclothiazide acts at a site on the AMPA receptor different from that for GYKI 52466.", 
    "76": "Acinar cell inhibitors (eg, atropine) fail to ameliorate clinical and experimental acute pancreatitis.

    "77": "Using acinar cell amylase activity as an index of hyperstimulation, we studied 63 rats in two sets of experiments. Bile-pancreatic juice exclusion from gut--without (set one) and with (set two) bile and pancreatic duct obstruction--was treated with atropine and CCK-receptor antagonist L-364,718, or with enteral replacement of bile-pancreatic juice.",

    "79": "According to this experimental corollary of early gallstone impaction, prevention of acinar cell hyperstimulation after duct occlusion should be aimed at the source of the response to bile-pancreatic juice exclusion, namely, the gut, rather than at the target of the response, the pancreatic acinar cell.", 
    "80": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is metabolized by CYP3A enzymes. Rifampin is a potent enzyme inducer that may seriously interact with some substrates of CYP3A4.", 
    "81": "The possible interaction between rifampin and midazolam was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study of two phases. Rifampin (600 mg once daily) or placebo was administered to 10 healthy subjects for 5 days. On the sixth day, the subjects were given 15 mg oral midazolam. Plasma samples were collected for determination of midazolam, and pharmacodynamic effects were measured for 10 hours.", 
    "82": "Rifampin pretreatment decreased the area under the plasma midazolam concentration-time curve by 96% (i.e., from 10.2 +/- 0.8 to 0.42 +/- 0.05 micrograms.min/ml [mean +/- SEM; p < 0.001]) and the maximum concentration by 94% (i.e., from 55 +/- 4 to 3.5 +/- 0.7 ng/ml [p < 0.001]). The elimination half-life of midazolam was decreased from 3.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.3 +/- 0.2 hours by rifampin (p < 0.001). During the rifampin phase, the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam were markedly smaller than the effects during the placebo phase in all the tests (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test; p < 0.001).", 
    "83": "The observed substantial decrease in plasma concentrations and effects of midazolam most likely results from induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin in both the gut wall and the liver. Orally administered midazolam is ineffective during rifampin treatment.", 
    "84": "The in vivo quantification of the benzodiazepine receptor concentration in humans using PET and flumazenil (FMZ) is usually based on Scatchard analysis when the goal is to avoid blood sampling. The experimental protocols, however, include several (at least two) experiments with various specific activities in the same subject to obtain a range of bound ligand concentrations.", 
    "85": "We propose the partial saturation method, which is based on a natural decrease in bound ligand concentration after an FMZ injection with an average dose between a tracer dose and a saturation dose. An adequate range of bound ligand concentrations can thus be obtained from a single experiment. The free ligand concentration is estimated from the PET measurement in the pons after correction for the effect of the small receptor site concentration in this reference region.",

The mean +/- SD length of stay was approximately 40% shorter for the divalproex sodium (10.2 +/- 2.0 days) and the lithium/carbamazepine combination (11.7 +/- 2.1 days) groups compared with the lithium alone (17.6 +/- 1.0 days) and the carbamazepine alone (18.1 +/- 3.0 days) groups. Regression analysis of possible confounding variables including adjunctive treatment (benzodiazepines and neuroleptics), severity of illness (number of years ill and previous hospitalizations), and discharge date revealed no statistically significant effect.",

Although baseline HPA axis disturbances in patients with panic disorder appear to attenuate with treatment, there is evidence that they may be linked to poorer long-term outcomes.", 
    "94": "Follow-up clinical data were obtained for 18 of 20 patients with panic disorder who participated in a detailed study of HPA axis activity in panic, both before and during their treatment with alprazolam. HPA axis assessment included monitoring of adrenocorticotropin and cortisol over a full circadian cycle. The relationships between disability and clinical status at 2-year follow-up and HPA axis overactivity at entry were examined.",

    "97": "The effect of diazepam on the development of physical dependence on morphine and on the naloxone-precipitated increase in cortical NA turnover were investigated in mice. Co-administration of diazepam (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.) during chronic morphine treatment suppressed the expression of naloxone (3 mg/kg, s.c.)-precipitated withdrawal signs (jumping, exploratory rearing and weight loss). However, a single injection of diazepam (4 mg/kg, i.p.) in morphine-dependent mice did not affect the expression of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs. The 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) level and noradrenaline (NA) turnover (MHPG/NA) in the cerebral cortex were increased by naloxone (3 mg/kg) challenge. These increases in the cortical MHPG level and NA turnover were significantly prevented by co-administration of diazepam (4 mg/kg, i.p.) during chronic morphine treatment. These findings suggest that the co-administration of diazepam during chronic morphine treatment may prevent some neurochemical changes in the central noradrenergic system during chronic morphine treatment, and may suppress the development of physical dependence on morphine. Therefore, the inhibitory action of GABA via benzodiazepine binding sites may play an important role in the development of physical dependence on morphine.", 
    "98": "L-Glutamate, NMDA, DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), and kainate (KA) increased the release of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SRIF-LI) from primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. In Mg(2+)-containing medium, the maximal effects (reached at approximately 100 microM) amounted to 737% (KA), 722% (glutamate), 488% (NMDA), and 374% (AMPA); the apparent affinities were 22 microM (AMPA), 39 microM (glutamate), 41 microM (KA), and 70 microM (NMDA). The metabotropic receptor agonist trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate did not affect SRIF-LI release. The release evoked by glutamate (100 microM) was abolished by 10 microM dizocilpine (MK-801) plus 30 microM 1-aminophenyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466). Moreover, the maximal effect of glutamate was mimicked by a mixture of NMDA+AMPA. The release elicited by NMDA was sensitive to MK-801 but insensitive to GYKI 52466. The AMPA- and KA-evoked releases were blocked by 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) or by GYKI 52466 but were insensitive to MK-801. The release of SRIF-LI elicited by all four agonists was Ca(2+) dependent, whereas only the NMDA-evoked release was prevented by tetrodotoxin. Removal of Mg2+ caused increase of basal SRIF-LI release, an effect abolished by MK-801. Thus, glutamate can stimulate somatostatin release through ionotropic NMDA and AMPA/KA receptors. Receptors of the KA type (AMPA insensitive) or metabotropic receptors appear not to be involved.", 
    "99": "The binding site for 1,4-benzodiazepines in the brain is part of the hetero-oligomeric gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex which regulates a chloride ion channel. The presence of the gamma 2 subunit in the complex is necessary for the binding of benzodiazepines to their binding site. This study demonstrates a reduction of benzodiazepine receptor radioligand binding by 43% compared to control following infusion of phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to gamma 2 subunit into rat hippocampus. Reduction of benzodiazepine binding sites was paralleled by a decrease in [35S]tert-butyl-bicyclo-phosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding (51%) and [3H]muscimol binding (37%), indicating a reduction in the number of GABAA receptors. Changed macroscopic appearance, reduced protein content and severe loss of neurones in antisense-treated hippocampi suggests that the reduced formation of GABAA receptors leads to neuronal cell death.", 
    "100": "To gain a better understanding of the role of cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor in the maintenance of thermal hyperalgesia induced by unilateral constriction injury to the sciatic nerve in the rat, this study evaluated the effects of intrathecally administered YM022 (a CCK-B receptor antagonist) on thermal hyperalgesia. Drugs were administered intrathecally 1 or 5 weeks after the nerve injury (1 and 5 week study). In the 5 week study, but not the 1 week study, YM022 attenuated the level of thermal hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that a CCK-B receptor antagonist attenuates the level of thermal hyperalgesia and this effect of a CCK-B receptor antagonist is time-dependent.", 
    "101": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors mediate cholesterol translocation between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes in steroidogenic tissues. They are found in many other tissues too, including liver. We studied the effect of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline-3-carboxa mid e], Ro 5-4864 (4-chlorodiazepam), hemin, protoporphyrin IX and N-methyl protoporphyrin IX on cholesterol mitochondrial intermembrane transport of cholesterol in vitro in rat liver. Endogenous cholesterol translocation from outer to inner mitochondrial membranes was significantly increased by PK11195 and N-methyl protoporphyrin IX (140% and 150% increase, respectively, at 1 microM, P<0.01). 5 microM protoporphyrin IX, 1 microM Ro 5-4864 and 5 microM hemin was ineffective. When mitochondria were labeled with exogenous [4-14C]cholesterol, PK11195 and N-methyl protoporphyrin IX were the most effective in increasing total cholesterol incorporation and cholesterol translocation into inner membranes, and their effect was dose-dependent. These data suggest that in liver the binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors is related to cholesterol translocation and the interaction of ligands with these receptors may play a role in the complex mechanism of regulation of cholesterol traffic between liver mitochondrial membranes.", 
    "102": "The behavioural and anticonvulsant effects of several 1-aryl-3,5-dihydro-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones (2,3-BZs) and of 11b-aryl-7,11-dihydro-3-phenyl[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[5,4-a][2,3]benz odiazepin-6-ones (2,3-OBZs) were studied after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration in DBA/2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures. The seizures were evoked by means of auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12-16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a hemispheric Perspex dome. The 2,3-benzodiazepines studied after 30 min pretreatment were generally less potent than the related derivative 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466) except 3,5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-1-phenyl-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one (2,3-BZ-2) and 2,3-BZ-2M (3-methyl derivative of 2,3-BZ-2) which showed comparable activity. Thirty minutes after i.p. administration of 2,3-benzodiazepines, the rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity against clonus was 2,3-BZ-2 > GYKI 52466 > 2,3-BZ-2M > 2,3-BZ-1 > 2,3-BZ-3, > 2,3-OBZ-1, > 2,3-OBZ-2 2,3-OBZ-3. The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of aniracetam on it own (12.5 - 100 nmol/mouse) had no convulsant activity, but it reversed the anticonvulsant effects of some 2,3-benzodiazepines. In particular, the pharmacological actions of GYKI 52466, 2,3-BZ-2 and 2,3-BZ-2M, which proved to be the most potent 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives as anticonvulsants, were significantly reduced by an i.c.v. pretreatment with aniracetam (50 nmol/mouse). Concomitant treatment with aniracetam (50 nmol/mouse) shifted to the right the dose-response curves and significantly increased the ED50 values for GYKI 52466, 2,3-BZ-2 and 2,3-BZ-2M. After 30 min pretreatment 2,3-BZ-2 showed a similar potency to GYKI 52466 in antagonizing seizures induced by i.c.v. administration of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), thus suggesting a clear involvement of AMPA receptors in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds. In addition, 2,3-BZ-2 and 2,3-BZ-2M showed anticonvulsant properties longer lasting than GYKI 52466.", 
    "103": "Several recent studies have suggested that feeding suppression is mediated jointly by enhanced neurotransmission of cholecystokinin (CCK) and serotonergic (5-HT) systems. In the present study the CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide (50-200 micrograms kg-1, s.c.) was found reliably to potentiate the feeding response elicited by dorsal or median raphe injection of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.2-0.8 nmol). This effect was evident following co-administration of both feeding threshold and subthreshold doses of either compound, suggesting that the simultaneous suppression of CCK and 5-HT function may interact as joint effectors of overeating.", 
    "104": "The sequence upstream from the first exon in the rat mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor-encoding gene (MBR) was analyzed for transcriptional promoter activity by three techniques: promoter deletion analysis in vectors containing the gene cat encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) and DNase I protection assay. All three methods are in uniformity with the identification of at least three regulatory elements corresponding to locations -51/-33, -267/-249 and -555/-526. The most distal and proximal domains are positive-acting, whereas the element at -267/-249 acts in a negative manner. The positive-acting -51/-33 element contains the middle of three consensus Sp1-recognition sequences found in this region of the gene. Binding of Y1 cell nuclear protein to a DNA fragment corresponding to this region of the gene is competed by a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide bearing the consensus Sp1-binding site sequence. These studies provide the first reported functional evidence localizing transcriptional elements of MBR.", 
    "105": "In group-housed mice (ten per cage), mice removed last from their home cage always have higher rectal temperatures than mice removed first from this cage. Stress-induced hyperthermia is calculated as the difference (delta T) between the basal temperature (mouse number 1) and the end temperature (mouse number 10) when the temperature of the ten mice is sequentially measured using a 1-min interval between rectal measurements. Using this protocol, various drugs, belonging to different pharmacological classes, were tested in order to investigate their putative anxiolytic effect, measured as a decrease in delta T. Benzodiazepines (diazepam, alprazolam), alcohol, and some (flesinoxan, buspirone), but not all (ipsapirone) 5-HT1A receptor agonists had anxiolytic properties with this protocol. Clonidine (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) and prazosine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) had, but at high doses, some anxiolytic actions. Antidepressants (desipramine, fluvoxamine, nomifensine, tianeptine, amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine), serotonergic ligands (ondansetron, ketanserin, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), fenfluramine, metachlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), eltoprazine) and various other drugs (phenobarbital, pentetrazol, haloperidol, apomorphine, amphetamine, (+)-N-[1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3( R)-yl]- N'-(3-methylphenyl)urea (MSD 365260), dizocilpine and acetyl salicylic acid) had no anxiolytic activity. The stress-induced hyperthermia protocol used was unable to detect anxiogenic properties of drugs, probably due to a (physiological) ceiling in the maximal end temperature. The stress-induced hyperthermia protocol with mice can be used to measure anxiolytic properties of drugs and is a fast and robust model which does not need extensive training of animals.", 
    "106": "NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to be anxiolytic in animal models of anxiety, although they have not been tested extensively. These compounds bind to several specific sites within the NMDA-receptor complex, including the NMDA site itself, the phencyclidine site, and the strychnine-insensitive glycine site. The purpose of the present study was to examine potential anxiolytic effects of site-selective NMDA receptor antagonists in the elevated plus-maze. Drug-naive albino mice were placed in the center of an elevated maze shaped like a plus sign. Two opposing arms were enclosed by high walls; the crossing arms were open. Following injection with drug or vehicle, the number of entries and time spent in each type of arm were measured during 5-min tests. Analysis of results showed that the benzodiazepine, diazepam, and the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, NPC 17742 (2R,4R,5S 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid), increased number of open arm entries and open arm time. N-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor which may interfere with the transduction of NMDA receptor activation, also increased open arm entries and time; however, the magnitude of these increases was small. The phencyclidine-site NMDA receptor antagonist, phencyclidine, increased open arm entries, but failed to significantly increase open arm time. ACEA 1021 (5-nitro-6,7-dichloro-1,4-dihydro-2,3-quinoxalinedione), a putative glycine-site antagonist, had significant effects only on open arm entries at the highest dose tested. These results suggest that NMDA receptor antagonists show promise as potential anxiolytic agents, but that differences among antagonists acting at different cellular sites may be expected.", 
    "107": "This study was performed to evaluate the optimal doses and clinical efficacy of clonazepam as a first-line drug in acute mania, as well as to determine its effective plasma concentrations. Clonazepam was administered orally to 11 newly admitted inpatients. On day 0, the loading dose was titrated upward according to the clinical global impression; the maintenance dose was calculated with intent to maintain the plasma level that had been achieved after initial dose escalation. Clinically based dose adjustments were allowed on days 4 and 7. Manic symptoms were scored on days 0, 4 and 14 according to a time-blind procedure; clonazepam plasma levels were measured by HPLC. On day 14, there was a significant decrease in manic symptoms and 66.7% of the patients who completed the trial were markedly improved. Steady-state plasma levels of clonazepam were significantly correlated with daily doses (rs = 0.795, P < 0.005) and therapeutic concentrations ranged between 6.5-83.9 micrograms/l. At the onset of therapy, the clinically titrated loading dose resulted in plasma concentrations within the narrow range of 18.9-34.0 micrograms/l. These results support the potential value of clonazepam in the short-term management of acute mania; the initial control of agitation was achieved with plasma drug levels in a remarkably narrow range as compared with the further control of mania.", 
    "108": "We investigated the role of brain peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) and pregnenolone (a product of PBRs activation) in hepatic encephalopathy (HE)/hyperammonemia. Administration of the hepatotoxin, thioacetamide, or ammonium acetate to mice for 3 days significantly increased the number of brain PBRs (138-146% of control) and the affinity of the ligands for these receptors (2-fold). The total content of pregnenolone and its rate of synthesis in brain of the experimental animals were significantly increased. Our results suggest a novel integrated mechanism by which ammonia-induced activation of PBRs leads to elevated levels of pregnenolone-derived neurosteroids which are known to enhance GABA-ergic neurotransmission. This mechanism may play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of HE.", 
    "109": "The binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513, [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]flumazenil to rat CNS membranes was studied at 2 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C using ligand concentrations ranging from approximately 0.06 nM to 10 microM. Analysis of the binding saturation data suggested the existence of high-affinity sites (Kd < 10 nM) and low-affinity sites (Kd > 100 nM) for each ligand. When binding was performed using very low ligand concentrations a benzodiazepine site with an exceptionally high affinity for Ro 15-4513 (Kd approximately 0.1 nM) was evident in all major regions of the CNS except the cerebellum. This site was most prevalent in the hippocampus, medulla and spinal cord where it accounted for approximately 70% of the specific binding when [3H]Ro 15-4513 was approximately 0.06 nM. The selectivity of Ro 15-4513 for this site as compared to other high-affinity sites was 20- to 60-fold depending on the incubation temperature and CNS region. The affinity for the very high-affinity site was decreased approximately 3-fold as temperature was increased from 2 degrees C to 37 degrees C (Kd approximately 0.1 nM and approximately 0.3, respectively), which was similar to the effect of temperature on other high-affinity sites (Kd approximately 2.6 nM at 2 degrees C and approximately 8 nM at 37 degrees C). Flumazenil, flunitrazepam, and diazepam did not differentiate the very high-affinity [3H]Ro 15-4513 site from other BZ sites, but alpidem exhibited a low affinity for it (IC50 approximately 5 microM). GABA at 100 microM had little effect on the Kd value for the very high-affinity site (GABA shift: approximately 0.8 to 1.0), suggesting that Ro 15-4513 is a partial inverse agonist or an antagonist at this site. These findings provide further evidence for the pharmacologic diversity of BZ sites on different subtypes of GABAA receptors.",

    "111": "A panel of internationally recognized Experts in treating anxiety and depression was constituted by multistage peer nomination. 90% completed a questionnaire. This report focuses on case vignettes of 7 anxiety disorders followed by questions about relevant therapeutic options.", 
    "112": "Panelists usually recommended both psychological and pharmacological interventions. Most favored antidepressants, usually tricyclic, for agoraphobia, panic and OCD; beta-blockers for specific social phobia; and benzodiazepines for GAD and adjustment disorder. Some Experts favored polypharmacy, usually an antidepressant and a benzodiazepine. The majority usually advocated pharmacotherapy for 6 months or more. They recommended the same duration of treatment with benzodiazepines and other medications, except for GAD.", 
    "113": "The responses of the Expert Panel imply that; (1) most anxiety disorders are serious and merit vigorous, prolonged pharmacotherapy; and (2) antidepressants and benzodiazepines are effective and safe for long-term treatment of these conditions. This outcome contrasts with the widespread apprehension about long-term pharmacotherapy, especially with benzodiazepines, and some regulatory views.", 
    "114": "We investigated whether muscarinic receptors of the M1-M4 receptor subtypes are constitutively active. We have found that the synthesis of cyclic AMP was enhanced by the muscarinic antagonists atropine and N-methylscopolamine (NMS) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human m2 and m4 muscarinic receptor genes and in rat cardiomyocytes expressing the M2 receptor subtype, and that the production of inositol phosphates was inhibited by atropine and NMS in CHO cells stably transfected with human m1 and m3 and with rat m1 muscarinic receptor genes. The muscarinic antagonists quinuclidinyl benzilate and AF-DX 116 had no effect in some cases and acted like atropine and NMS in others. We conclude that the M1-M4 subtypes of muscarinic receptors are constitutively active in the CHO cell lines expressing them and in cardiomyocytes and that atropine and NMS act as negative antagonists on these receptor subtypes by stabilizing them in the inactive conformation.", 
    "115": "mRNA expression of GABA-gated Cl(-)-channels in rat antepituitary was evaluated by using an reverse-transcribed (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method with degenerate and specific oligonucleotides. The main result of our findings is that the antepituitary expresses mRNAs encoding alpha 4 and rho 1 GABA receptor subunits. These two subunits are believed to be, respectively, constituents of benzodiazepine-insensitive GABAA and GABAC receptors in the CNS. This molecular analysis is consistent with the pharmacological diversity of GABA receptors in pituitary cells.", 
    "116": "Treatment of hysteria requires establishing a management strategy. The first steps consist of symptomatic treatment (catharsis, counter-suggestion, hypnosis, narco-analysis, relaxation, focused psychoanalytical psychotherapy, drug therapy). Thereafter, an approach aiming to modify the psychic structure of the patient can be considered (supportive psychotherapy, psychoanalysis). Occasionally, a systemic approach is necessary. Although each facet of the treatment must be conducted by a specialist, one physician must supervise the overall strategy; this role falls naturally to the family doctor.", 
    "117": "23 patients with a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomly assigned to 8 weeks' treatment with alprazolam or placebo. They filled in self-ratings before and after treatment and competed on a competitive reaction time task, designed to measure behavioural aggression, after 8 weeks' treatment. Patients taking both alprazolam and placebo rated decreased anxiety after 8 weeks' treatment but those on alprazolam also tended to report less hostility. On the behavioural task, patients on alprazolam behaved more aggressively in response to provocation. This is the first study to confirm clinical reports of benzodiazepine-induced dyscontrol on an objective laboratory measure. It is important that it is followed up in a larger group of patients.", 
    "118": "Not until the 19th century theories on sleep were based upon experimental findings in animal and humans. The so-called 'hypnotoxin theory' culminated, when Legendre and Pi\u00e9ron successfully induced sleep in a dog by transmission of cerebrospinal fluid from a dog deprived of sleep. The main discussion concerning the origin of sleep has been the question if sleep is a passive or an active state. Similarities with coma, the positive Babinski sign and pathoanatomical findings in patients who died after encephalitis lethargica were the arguments for the 'deafferentiation hypothesis'. Bremer's classical brainstem-transsections in cats confirmed this idea. Pavlov was the major representative of the idea that sleep was due to a general inhibition of the brain. Hess induced physiological sleep in cats by electrical stimulation of the diencephalon, proving the active nature of sleep. The introduction of the EEG in animals by Caton and in humans by Berger allowed for the first time the measurement of sleep depth without waking the sleeper. After discovery of the REM sleep periods by Aserinsky and Kleitman in 1953 and the demonstration of periodical sleep cycles by Dement and Kleitman, polysomnography with simultaneous whole night recording of EEG, EMG, electrooculogram and other physiological parameters was established as the major diagnostic tool in sleep disorders. One of the most important questions about the function of sleep is still unresolved. NREM sleep is believed to have a restorative function, whereas REM sleep might be involved in learning processes. According to the sleep interpretation of Sigmund Freud, the dream content represents endogenous wishes which cannot be expressed during wakefulness because of an internal 'sensor'. A more recent theory by Hobson explains the dreams by a very unspecific brainstem activity occurring during REM sleep which projects to the frontal brain and activates stored memory. The most important sleep disease of the 20th century is certainly the sleep-apnea syndrome. Charles Dickens described in his 'Pickwick Papers' subjects with this illness already 150 years ago. The pathogenetic significance of the apneas during sleep, however, were recognized in 1965 only by Gastaut and at the same time by Jung and Kuhlo. Treatment for insomniacs was restricted for many years to alcohol, opium and barbiturates. Following the horrible sequelae of thalidomide therapy in 1956, a more efficient treatment was available through the introduction of benzodiazepines after 1960.", 
    "119": "Insomnia, especially when chronic, is associated with disturbances in daytime well-being and performance, resulting in a poor quality of life for those affected. Zopiclone has been proven as a drug that favourably balances sleep induction and maintenance as well as an improvement in daytime well-being (efficacy) with a low potential for adverse effects (safety) in the symptomatic treatment of insomnia. Management of chronic insomnia with zopiclone needs a multidimensional approach involving the proper diagnosis of possible underlying causes, and combined use of causal treatment, general sleep hygiene measures, basic elements of psychological treatment and adjunctive medication. It is recommended that therapy with the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic zopiclone should conform to the guidelines for the use of hypnotics, which are valid for all benzodiazepine receptor agonists.", 
    "120": "The antispastic triazole, 4-methyl-3-methylsulphonyl-5-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole (MDL 27,531) was tested in glycine- and muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- influx into brain membrane preparations. MDL 27,531 (100 nM) had no effect on glycine- (100 nM-400 microM) stimulated 36Cl- influx in brain stem tissue; on the other hand, MDL 27,531 (10 nM-10 microM) enhanced muscimol- (1 microM) stimulated 36Cl- influx in cerebellar but not cortical membranes. In the presence of the benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist, flumazenil (10 microM), MDL 27,531 inhibited muscimol-stimulated flux. These data suggest a novel interaction of this triazole with subtypes of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex and the BZD receptor.", 
    "121": "In the present study we investigated the influence of acute lead poisoning upon the expression of benzodiazepine receptors. In addition, we examined if administration of PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, to lead-poisoned rats could modulate the changes in receptor binding properties achieved by lead alone. Lead poisoning was ascertained by determination of urine delta-aminolevulinic acid levels and lead levels in rat livers. Scatchard analysis of saturation curves of [3H]PK 11195 binding to liver membranes of rats treated with lead alone or with both lead and PK 11195 showed and approximately two-fold decrease in receptor density in comparison with control groups. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in kidneys and adrenals of poisoned rats was not changed by lead intoxication per se or by coadministration of PK 11195. Scatchard analysis of saturation curves of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in rat cerebral cortex tissue showed no difference in the receptor density between the various groups. The Kd values of all organs were in the nanomolar range (1-4 nM). We conclude that PK 11195 is not a protective agent of hepatic peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in lead intoxication. Moreover, it causes over-accumulation of lead in hepatocytes in an unknown mechanism of action.", 
    "122": "Specific binding for the radioligand [3H]CCK-8s has been identified in chicken brain, hypothalamus, pancreas, gallbladder and caecum membranes. This binding was found to be of high affinity, low capacity and saturable, suggesting the presence of specific CCK receptors in these tissues. Scatchard analysis indicated the existence of a single binding site for each tissue. Dissociation constant (kd) values were 0.63 +/- 0.18, 0.73 +/- 0.13, 0.85 +/- 0.12, 1.47 +/- 0.21 and 0.96 nM for brain, hypothalamus, pancreas, caecum and gallbladder, respectively. Binding densities (Bmax) were higher for brain, pancreas and caecum (32.60 +/- 10.70, 30.33 +/- 2.40 and 35.83 +/- 5.10 fmol/mg protein, respectively) than for the other two tissues (9.75 +/- 1.90 and 6.31 fmol/mg protein for hypothalamus and gallbladder, respectively). As in mammals, CCK-4 shows high affinity for CCK receptors located in chicken brain and hypothalamus, and very low affinity for those located in peripheral structures. L-364,718 (a CCK-A antagonist) showed a relative selectivity and a high affinity for those receptors located in central tissues, whereas L-365,260 (a CCK-B antagonist) is almost inactive in all studied tissues. These results give support for the existence of at least two distinct CCK receptors in birds and that these receptors are relatively different from those described in mammals."
