    "0": "GABAA receptors are GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-gated chloride channels, which are major mediators of neuronal inhibition in the brain and are modulated by benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol, and other important centrally acting drugs. Although previous pharmacological and biochemical data had suggested a degree of heterogeneity, recent cloning of at least 15 different receptor subunits, thought to be combined in groups of five, indicates that the brain may contain a truly astonishing variety of GABAA receptor subtypes. This review describes the little that is known about these subtypes, emphasizing possible molecular bases of receptor heterogeneity. We also discuss approaches to establishing the subunit composition of subtypes.", 
    "1": "We have studied the effects of divalent cations on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) response of voltage-clamped spinal cord neurons, using the whole-cell recording configuration. Zn, Cd, Ni, and Mn (but not Ba, Ca, or Mg) inhibit GABA-induced whole-cell currents when applied extracellularly. Although Zn is an effective inhibitor when applied extracellularly, it is ineffective when applied intracellularly. Inhibition by these cations is mediated by a common saturable recognition site that is distinct from the recognition sites for GABA, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, picrotoxin, or steroids. The maximal inhibition, or efficacy of inhibition, of GABA-induced currents is greater for Zn than for Cd, Ni, or Mn. The order of potency is Cd greater than Zn much greater than Ni much greater than Mn. Inhibition by Zn is partially surmountable by GABA, consistent with a decrease in both the maximum response and the affinity for GABA. The dose-response curve for inhibition of the GABA response by Zn is shifted to the right at a high GABA concentration but is unaffected by the presence of chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, or 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one. The results are consistent with a model in which a Zn-sensitive modulatory site exerts negative allosteric control over GABA receptor function.", 
    "2": "The effects of cocaine on benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor binding in the rat brain were investigated using homogenate receptor binding and quantitative autoradiography. Although acute cocaine injections produced little or no effect on BZD binding sites, chronic administration resulted in differential effects in brain regions associated with the mesocorticolimbic and nigro-striatal dopaminergic neuronal system, respectively. BZD receptor binding was increased significantly in the caudate nucleus and decreased in the substantia nigra for up to 2 days after the final injection, whereas binding was decreased in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex and increased in the ventral tegmental area after daily injections of cocaine for 15 days. Binding was altered significantly only in the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area 2 weeks after the final cocaine injection. Intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine attenuated or reversed the cocaine-induced changes in BZD receptor binding, suggesting that these effects were mediated, in part, through the effects of the drug on dopaminergic neuronal activity. Dopamine may be involved in the regulation of BZD receptors because 6-hydroxydopamine administration produced changes in BZD receptor binding in saline-treated rats that were generally in the opposite direction to those observed in cocaine-treated rats following sham treatment.", 
    "3": "Characteristics of the benzodiazepine inhibition of dopamine (DA) release in PC12 cells were investigated. Diazepam inhibited DA release evoked by high concentrations of extracellular K+ in a dose-dependent manner (IC50, 10 microM). Ro 5-4864 [7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-(p-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine- 2-one], a peripheral-type benzodiazepine, also inhibited DA release effectively. PK 11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide], a benzodiazepine generally considered a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, did not antagonize the inhibition induced by diazepam, but rather inhibited DA release itself. On the other hand, the central-type benzodiazepines, clonazepam and Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) did not affect the DA release. Diazepam, Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 also inhibited a Ba(++)-current carried by voltage-gated Ca++ channels, and diazepam suppressed an increase in intracellular Ca++ evoked by 80 mM extracellular K+ as measured by the fura-2 method. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of diazepam and other benzodiazepines on DA release from PC12 cells may be mediated through one type of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors which are coupled to voltage-gated Ca++ channels and that these receptors may not necessarily be the same as those in other tissues.", 
    "4": "In order to investigate whether treatment with terbutaline (1 mg subcutaneously) in patients with bronchial obstruction is accompanied by changes in the densities of receptors of the autonomic nervous system, beta-adrenergic receptors or m-cholinergic receptors were measured in membrance preparations of human peripheral lung tissue from patients undergoing lung resection for bronchial carcinoma. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors and mononuclear leukocytes (MNLs) of treated and untreated patients and beta-adrenergic receptors and m-cholinergic receptors in lung strips from the same patients exposed to terbutaline in vitro were studied for comparison. In patients, treatment with terbutaline did not have any effect on human lung beta-adrenergic receptors and m-cholinergic receptors, whereas a 57 percent decline was measured in the number of beta-receptors on MNLs of the very same patients. In contrast, in vitro exposure of human peripheral lung strips to terbutaline (100 mumol/L for 36 hours) evoked a time-dependent and concentration-dependent decline of 46 percent in beta-adrenergic receptors. Again, there was no change in the number of m-cholinergic receptors. The antagonist affinities, as judged from the KD values, did not differ under either condition. We concluded that lung beta-adrenergic receptors are subject to down-regulation when exposed to agonists in vitro. This down-regulation in the human lung is not accompanied by alterations in m-cholinergic receptors. Down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors or up-regulation of m-cholinergic receptors appears not to play a role in the proposed tolerance to beta-adrenergic receptor agonist treatment in clinical situations. The reduction of beta-adrenergic receptors in MNLs provides evidence that treatment with terbutaline was sufficient to affect beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo in certain cell types but also shows that alterations in blood cells do not necessarily reflect the situation in the lung.", 
    "5": "Neuroactive steroids, in particular 3 alpha-hydroxypregnanes, are allosteric modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor. Regionally selective expression of receptor subunit subtypes may account for differential responsiveness of tissues to GABAergic inhibition and neurosteroid modulatory effects. The effect of 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (epiallopregnanolone) on heterotropic cooperativity on the GABAA receptor complex has been studied in three subtypes of expressed recombinant human receptors and in rat brain and spinal cord. Steroid potentiation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was greatest for the alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2 receptor complex, whereas alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 and alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2 complexes showed less than 100% enhancement in binding. Previous studies suggest that the spinal cord is devoid of alpha 1, whereas cerebellum is rich in alpha 1 subunits. Correspondingly, a differential enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in spinal cord (51%) versus cerebellum (28%) was also observed. The structure of neuroactive steroids is important in determinikng the extent of neuromodulatory activity. The 5 beta-pregnanes,5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (epipregnanolone) and 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one (5 beta-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone), were both less potent than their corresponding 5 alpha derivatives. A 3 alpha hydroxyl group is essential for neuromodulatory activity in the expressed receptors, as demonstrated by the observation that 5 alpha-pregnan-3 beta-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) and 4-pregnen-3, 20-dione (progesterone) were both inactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The possible biosynthetic origin of benzodiazepine-like molecules was investigated in mammalian tissue. Rat brain homogenates or cortical slices incubated under physiological conditions showed a 4 to 7 fold increase in the content of BZD-like compounds as compared with control non incubated or boiled tissue. The quantitative analysis was performed by a radioimmunoassay with a specific monoclonal antibody. The active fraction eluting just before diazepam exhibited a Mr lower than 1300 and inhibited the [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the central benzodiazepine receptor. No activity was measured in the absence of tissue. These data suggest that under our experimental conditions, low molecular weight substances similar to benzodiazepines are formed in rat brain.", 
    "7": "The effects of i.p. injection of 3 aromatic amino acids and two anxiogenic agents on rat brain isatin concentration and tribulin (endogenous monoamine oxidase inhibitor) activity were investigated. Isatin levels were significantly increased by pentylenetetrazole, confirming the link with 'anxiety', but were unaffected by the other compounds. In contrast, tribulin activity was significantly increased by phenylalanine and tryptophan as well as by both pentylenetetrazole and yohimbine. Whilst these findings shed no light on the mode of synthesis of isatin, they clearly demonstrate the existence of rat brain monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity that is different from it.", 
    "8": "The M1 potency (decrease in neurogenic response) of carbachol, oxotremorine, muscarine, arecaidine propargly ester (APE) and 4-(4-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium iodide (4-Cl-McN-A-343) in rabbit field-stimulated vas deferens (prostatic segments) increased up to 15-fold when calcium was lowered (3.5-1.0 nM). The M2 receptor-mediated increase in twitch height in response to carbachol and the M1 affinity of pirenzepine were independent of calcium concentration (2.5 and 1.0 mM). Thus, prostatic segments of rabbit vas deferens can be used successfully at 1.0 mM calcium to determine M1 potencies of agonists and M1 affinities of antagonists without counteracting stimulation of M2 receptors.", 
    "9": "Capillary electrophoresis (CE) separations are reported for sulfonamides and benzodiazepines in an uncoated fused-silica capillary. The capillary column exit was connected to a liquid junction-ion spray interface combination coupled to an atmospheric pressure ionization (API) triple quadrupole mass spectrometric (MS) system. On-line UV detection occurred 20 cm from the inlet of the capillary and with the API mass spectrometer (CE-API-MS) after the entire length of the capillary (100 cm). The separations were made using volatile buffers composed of ammonium acetate (15-20 mM) with 15-20% of methanol to facilitate ionization under electrospray conditions. This study showed that the major metabolite of flurazepam in man, N-1-hydroxyethylflurazepam, could be detected and characterized in human urine by CE-UV-MS following the administration of a single oral dose of 30 mg of flurazepam dihydrochloride. The presence of additional flurazepam metabolites in human urine was observed by using the system, suggesting that a combination of UV with MS detection should be useful for metabolic studies. In addition to molecular weight determination of compounds, structural information may be obtained by utilizing online tandem mass spectrometry (CE-UV-MS-MS). This was demonstrated for sulfamethazine where the protonated molecule species was transmitted into the collision cell of the tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Collision-induced dissociation of the protonated sulfamethazine molecule yielded structural information characteristic of the sulfa drug following the on-column injection of 2 pmol of sulfamethazine.", 
    "10": "The relationships between anxiety/stress, possible endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine receptors and the behavioral modification by drugs are discussed in this short review, including the specific characteristics of elements involved in those interactions, e.g. ones concerning the aversiveness of the stressful situation and the nature of the organism under investigation. These are important factors when considering aversive tasks, insofar as they may involve stressful conditions which differ in intensity and in the degree of control afforded the subject. These characteristics may well lead to differing functional effects on GABA-gated chloride channels or, in other words, to an incongruous balance between endogenous benzodiazepine receptor agonist and inverse agonist activity. This is not surprising, as it is well known that different forms of stressors often actually produce divergent behavioral, physiological and biochemical effects. This review also illustrates the necessity of taking into account the variable effects of stressors and/or drugs on animals differing in reactivity or emotionality, even in the case of 'non-selected' stocks. The implication is made that, by genetic and/or environmental manipulation of the emotional state of the animals used, it will be possible to obtain more clearly definable results in neuropharmacological and psychopharmacological studies.", 
    "11": "The effect of aging on the binding of ligands to the GABA, benzodiazepine and picrotoxin binding sites as well as alpha subunit mRNA level of GABAA receptor was investigated in cerebral cortex of male Fischer F-344 rats. In aged (730- to 770-day-old) rats, the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) was significantly reduced. Also, alpha 1 mRNA level was markedly decreased (86% suppression). In contrast, alpha 1 mRNA remained unchanged in cerebellum. These findings indicate a selective age-related structural change in GABAA receptor in rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "12": "The cardiopulmonary effects of repeated intravenous injections of a combination of diazepam and ketamine for anaesthesia were evaluated in six domestic sheep. Induction doses of 0.375 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg were followed by maintenance doses of 0.188 mg/kg and 3.75 mg/kg every 15 minutes for 105 minutes. Although this dosing regimen produced the desired anaesthetic effects, it caused untoward cardiopulmonary effects. Salient features of multiple dosing with diazepam and ketamine were hypoventilation, respiratory acidosis and an increase in both systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.", 
    "13": "R82913, (+)-S-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-9-chloro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)- imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione (a TIBO derivative), inhibited the replication of thirteen different strains of HIV-1 in CEM cells with a median IC50 of 0.15 microM. The concentration of compound that killed 50% of the cells was much higher (46 microM), indicating that R82913 has a high selectivity index. R82913 was 20-fold more potent than AZT-TP in the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in an assay using a naturally occurring template (ribosomal RNA) that more accurately resembles native viral RNA than a synthetic homopolymer. With this template, R82913 inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an ID50 (0.01 microM) that is equal to, or lower than, the IC50 for this compound in all of our cell culture assays (0.01-0.65 microM). R82913 has no effect on the replication of HIV-2 in CEM cells and does not inhibit the reverse transcriptase from this virus.", 
    "14": "A series of 2-phenyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-3-acetamides were designed and synthesized as non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics based on a molecular disconnection of a typical 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD). A number of these compounds showed submicromolar potency in a [3H]benzodiazepine binding assay in vitro and good potency in protecting rodents against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. Compound 84 appears to be a selective anticonvulsant (pentylenetetrazole) agent when tested against a profile of chemically and electrically induced seizures in mice. In addition, compound 148 appears to be a selective anxiolytic/hypnotic agent on the basis of biochemical and pharmacological characterization. It appears to be a full BZD agonist as assessed by GABA shift ratio and to be effective in punishment and nonpunishment animal models of anxiety. In addition, it shows a lower side-effect profile than diazepam as assessed by rotorod neurotoxicity and potentiation of ethanol-induced sleep time in mice. The chemistry and structure-activity relationships of this series is discussed.", 
    "15": "An impermeant benzodiazepine receptor ligand was prepared by derivatization of the aminobenzodiazepine 1012-S with 4-sulfophenylisothiocyanate. The resulting N-(4-sulfophenyl)-thiocarbamoyl derivative of 1012-S (SPTC-1012S) was purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and the predicted structure was verified by mass spectrometry. The apparent affinity of SPTC-1012S (IC50 = 9.8 +/- 2.9 nM) for displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam from intact chick cortical neurons was similar to that of 1012-S (IC50 = 4.0 +/- 0.3 nM). However, at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 microM, 1012-S was consistently more efficacious than SPTC-1012S, a finding indicating that 6-8% of the benzodiazepine receptor pool was not accessible to the impermeant compound. This inaccessible pool was eliminated by permeabilization of the cells with saponin or Triton X-100, a result suggesting that approximately 7% of neuronal benzodiazepine receptors are intracellular. Acute treatment (1-4 h at 37 degrees C) of neurons with 100 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or 100 nM clonazepam had little effect on the level of [3H]flunitrazepam binding but increased the proportion of intracellular receptors by 61 and 74%, respectively, compared with untreated controls. Similar treatment with 1 mM GABA increased the level of intracellular sites by 154-176%. The effect of GABA on receptor internalization was blocked by cotreatment with the GABAA receptor antagonist R 5135. The results suggest that SPTC-1012S can be used as a probe to study the internalization of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex under normal conditions or following acute or chronic treatment with agonists.", 
    "16": "Pubertal age and gonadal status in male rats influenced the functional response of the benzodiazepine (BZD)/GABA receptor chloride channel complex to an environmental challenge, i.e., encountering a stranger in familiar versus an unfamiliar environment. Chloride (Cl-) enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]Flu) binding was facilitated by exposure to an unfamiliar environment relative to that measured in response to a familiar environment in gonadally intact adult rats but not in prepubertal rats (28 days). Enhancement of [3H]Flu by Cl- at 28 days was not differentially affected by the two environments and did not differ from that measured in non-handled control rats at this age. While a differential effect of the two environments on Cl- enhancement of [3H]Flu binding was also present in adult rats castrated as juveniles (at 19 days), the relationship of environmental challenge to Cl- facilitation was the reverse of that measured in intact adult rats. In addition. GABA-mediated 36Cl- uptake was facilitated in intact adult rats tested in either the familiar or unfamiliar environment relative to non-handled intact adult rats. This change in GABA-gated chloride channel function in response to environmental challenge, however, was not present in adult rats castrated as juveniles nor in 28-day-old rats. Therefore, both pubertal age and gonadal status influenced the responsiveness of the BZD/GABA receptor complex to environmental challenge. These findings suggest that pubertal development and adult hormonal status are important determinants of the functional responsiveness of the BZD/GABA receptor complex to environmental challenge.",

    "24": "Oxygen saturation was recorded in 96 adults undergoing removal of third molar teeth in the dental surgery. Half the patients received local anaesthetic alone; the remainder received, in addition, intravenous midazolam. Patients receiving sedation sustained the greatest falls in oxygen saturation. However, in 10 out of 48 patients undergoing third molar removal with LA alone, oxygen saturations in the range of 93-89% were recorded. The results of this study suggest that all patients undergoing removal of third molars are at risk of hypoxia. Short episodes of hypoxia may be of little consequence in healthy patients, but in compromised patients early detection may avoid serious complications.", 
    "25": "Paired-pulse inhibition was studied extracellularly in in vitro hippocampal slices from rats sacrificed 48 h or 7 days after 1 week flurazepam (FZP) treatment. Population spikes and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded with NaCl-containing glass micropipettes in the stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum, respectively, of the CA1 region. Conditioning pulses were delivered by stimulating Shaffer collaterals (orthodromic) or the alveus (antidromic). Orthodromic test pulses were delivered with interpulse intervals of 10-200 ms. There was a significant reduction in paired-pulse inhibition in slices from treated vs control rats in both the orthodromic-orthodromic and antidromic-orthodromic paradigms. Reduced inhibition was evident 48 h, but not 7 days, after the end of FZP treatment. Furthermore, there was a significant prolongation of the half decay time of the field EPSP, without a significant change in the initial slope or maximum amplitude. The results may suggest an impairment of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid function in the hippocampus after chronic benzodiazepine (BZ) treatment and may provide a basis for a mechanism of BZ tolerance.", 
    "26": "Activation of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex has previously been shown to inhibit the release of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamus. To examine whether long-term activation of the GABA(A) receptor may also modulate the expression of the POMC gene in hypothalamic neurons, we have investigated the effect of chronic treatment with the centraltype benzodiazepine receptor agonist clonazepam, alone or in combination with the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, on POMC mRNA levels in four anatomical subdivisions of the arcuate nucleus of the rat hypothalamus, using quantitative in situ hybridization. Clonazepam treatment produced a significant decrease in POMC mRNA levels in all the regions of the arcuate nucleus with the exception of the most rostral one. Administration of both clonazepam and muscimol induced a marked reduction of mRNA levels in all the subdivisions of the arcuate nucleus. Chronic treatment with muscimol and clonazepam also induced a significant decrease in POMC mRNA level in the pars intermedia of the pituitary. These results, together with previous data, indicate that activation of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex inhibits the expression of the POMC gene as well as the release of POMC-derived mature peptides in both hypothalamic neurons and pituitary melanotrophs.", 
    "27": "beta-Carbolines occur in man and rat. The concentration in various tissues is about 100 to 1000 times lower than that of classical neurotransmitters. Administration of beta-carbolines in animals induces overlapping but not identical activity profiles. The molecular modes of action differ. For example, harman (1-methyl-beta-carboline) acts as an endogenous inhibitor of monoamine oxidase [E.C. 1.4.3.4.], subtype A, whereas norharman (beta-carboline) probably acts by stimulation of a specific beta-carboline receptor which is different from the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex. There is substantial evidence that tetrahydroisoquinolines occur under physiological conditions as well. Whether tetrahydropapaveroline serves as a precursor of morphinanes in mammals, as has been found in opium poppies, remains to be elucidated.", 
    "28": "The effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in controlling pain during biliary extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (BESWL) was assessed in 100 patients with symptomatic gallbladder calculi. Patients were divided into four groups: TENS electrodes were placed on the back at cutaneous anesthesia sites and on the right leg and the gallbladder acupuncture site in groups A and B. Electrodes were \"turned on\" only in group A. In groups C and D, electrodes were placed only on the back at cutaneous dermatomes. Electrodes were \"turned on\" in group C only. The TENS unit was stimulated at the pulse rate of 60 to 100 microseconds and frequency of 80 to 125 Hz. Lithotripsy was performed with the Lithostar Plus overhead module. The differences in the amount of analgesic used and the pain experiences by the patients in all groups were not statistically significant. The proportion of patients requiring intravenous analgesia in each group was also not significantly different (72%, 80%, 68%, 76% in groups A to D, respectively). Thus, TENS did not help in reducing the amount of intravenous analgesia required or the average pain perceived by the patient during lithotripsy treatment.",

    "30": "The acquisition of two-way active (shuttlebox) avoidance involves a conflict situation which can be used as an animal model of anxiety, since it is sensitive to manipulations of the animal's emotivity/reactivity. The results from the present study (experiment 1) add relevant support to that proposal, since diazepam (2 and 4 mg/kg) and the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam (1, 1.25 and 1.5 mg/kg) significantly improved avoidance performance in shuttlebox acquisition in rats in agreement with previous data. In another study (experiment 2), a mild stressful (10-day) handling procedure (i.e. handling which tends to increase the emotional reactivity of the animals, as showed in experiment 3) was found to affect such behaviour in an opposite direction to that of the two benzodiazepines. Conversely, when an habituating handling procedure (i.e. handling which leads to less reactive animals; experiment 3) was used, the acquisition of shuttlebox avoidance was improved (experiment 4). The results are discussed in relation with previous data showing that the particular parameters used in the exposure to stressful stimuli may lead to either sensitization or habituation of anxious responses.", 
    "31": "No data exist concerning human placental transfer of oral hypoglycemic agents during pregnancy. This study characterizes the transport of glyburide in 10 term human placentas with the single-cotyledon placental model. Serial samples were taken from both the maternal and fetal reservoirs during each 3-hour perfusion, and the percent transport and metabolism of tritiated glyburide was calculated with liquid scintillation spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. Antipyrine labeled with carbon 14 was added to the perfusate solution during these experiments as a control. Virtually no transfer of glyburide occurred, and no appreciable metabolism of the drug was detected. Neither variation in the albumin concentration nor increase in the maternal glyburide levels to 100 times therapeutic concentration materially altered the rate of transport. These data show that insignificant transport of glyburide occurs across the human placenta in vitro and suggest that fetal exposure to maternally administered glyburide likewise may be insignificant.", 
    "32": "We report the results of treatment of intractable seizures with lorazepam in seven neonates. All of the patients were part of a prospective study, who failed to respond to 40 mg/k of phenobarbital. Lorazepam was given intravenously at 0.05 mg/k and repeated up to a total dose of 0.15 mg/k if necessary. The diagnosis of seizures and the efficacy of treatment was assessed clinically and by EEG during the administration of lorazepam in three patients and on clinical grounds in four patients. Six patients were full term and one was premature; there were five males and two females. Four patients had hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, two had intracranial hemorrhage, and one had bacterial meningitis. Two patients received one dose of lorazepam, three received two doses, and two received three doses. Six patients responded with a complete cessation of seizures within three minutes of their last dose; the remaining patient (who received two doses) had a reduction in seizures. No patients developed apnea or hypotension during or immediately after the infusion of lorazepam and no other adverse effects were observed. Four patients remained seizure-free for the rest of the neonatal period and no other anticonvulsant medications were added. Seizures recurred in one patient at 16 hours; subsequent intermittent seizures were managed with additional phenobarbital. In another patient, seizures recurred at 12 hours and subsequent intermittent seizures were managed with phenytoin. In one patient, seizures continued with reduction of frequency and duration. We conclude that lorazepam may be effective in the treatment of neonatal seizures refractory to phenobarbital and that further treatment with intravenous phenytoin may be unnecessary under these circumstances.", 
    "33": "Surgeons who administer office anesthesia accept a serious responsibility for the well-being of their patients. Each must be thoroughly familiar with the agents they employ and prepared to deal with any complications or untoward events that might arise out of their use. Patients who are healthy or have well-controlled mild systemic disease are generally suitable for office procedures. Overly apprehensive patients, those with a history of anesthetic difficulties, or any patient with significant medical problems should be provided an anesthesiologist or competent Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). It is irresponsible and dangerous to administer anesthesia in a substandard facility or with an inadequate or inexperienced staff. All staff members should be BCLS (Basic Cardiac Life Support) qualified, and key individuals should be encouraged to obtain ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) certification. Proper pharmacologic preparation of the patient will allay anxiety, increase comfort, and reduce the overall quantity of anesthetic needed. Particularly useful agents include benzodiazepines (Valium and Versed) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Medication is not, however, a substitute for human contact, genuine concern, or timely reassurance. All patients receiving anything more than a small quantity of local anesthetic should be monitored by transcutaneous pulse oximetry, noninvasive sphygmomanometry, and real-time electrocardiography. Each provides important information on the patient's physiologic condition. Of these three monitors, the most important information is provided by the pulse oximeter. It is capable of detecting a problem before serious physiologic compromise has occurred and should be considered an indispensible part of each patient's care. A brief period of deep sedation for the administration of local anesthetic can safely be achieved using carefully titrated quantities of the short-acting barbiturate methohexital (Brevital). Gauging the proper end point of methohexital administration is accomplished through skilled observation of the patient. As the proper threshold is reached, a characteristic slackening of the jaw occurs usually in conjunction with a distinctive relaxation of the face. In the majority of cases, no change in the SaO2 will occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the co-administration of atropine and diazepam affect the rate and extent of absorption of either drug. A triple crossover pharmacokinetic study using adult sheep was conducted. Each of nine animals received single injections of atropine (2 mg), diazepam (10 mg), and a combination of the two compounds weekly over a 3-week period. The combination of the drugs was injected into a single intramuscular site through a specially designed tandem syringe. Blood samples were obtained from time 0 to 300 min post-injection. Serum samples were analyzed for atropine by radioimmunoassay and for diazepam by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated by non-compartmental analysis. The co-administration of atropine and diazepam intramuscularly in sheep caused a delay in the time to reach maximal concentration of atropine. However, at the time when a single injection of atropine reached its maximum serum concentration, 92 per cent of that concentration was reached by atropine in the presence of diazepam. Additionally, no difference was detected in the rate or extent of diazepam absorption when administered intramuscularly in combination with atropine at the same site.", 
    "35": "We have investigated the effects of midazolam on circulating concentrations of pituitary and pancreatic hormones in eight healthy patients during cholecystectomy and compared the changes with those in a control group of eight patients. Anaesthesia was induced either with midazolam 0.42 mg kg-1 i.v. followed by an infusion of midazolam 0.125 mg kg-1 for 1 h, or with a sleep dose of thiopentone. All patients received vecuronium, and the lungs were ventilated with 0.5-1.0% halothane and 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen. The use of midazolam was associated with a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in secretion of cortisol and insulin during surgery. Serum growth hormone secretion was augmented, but this did not reach statistical significance. There was little difference in the concentrations of circulating metabolites between the two groups, except for a significant decrease in blood glucose (P less than 0.05) in the midazolam group after 60 min. There were no marked differences in cardiovascular variables between the two groups of patients.", 
    "36": "Sixty-five patients with social phobia were treated in a study that compared a cognitive-behavioral group treatment program with pharmacotherapy with alprazolam, phenelzine sulfate, or pill-placebo plus instructions for self-directed exposure to phobic stimuli. Statistically significant repeated-measures effects were shown on all measures, indicating that the treatments studied were associated with substantial improvements in patients with severe and chronic social phobia. Patients who were treated with phenelzine were rated by clinicians as more improved on a measure of work and social disability than patients who were treated with alprazolam or placebo (patients in the cognitive-behavior therapy group were not rated on this measure). Subjects showed positive cognitive changes from before to after treatment, and there were no differences between treatment groups on the cognitive measure. We discuss the implications of these findings within the context of demographic and clinical predictors of response.", 
    "37": "Reports of adverse behavioral reactions to triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine ultra-short-acting hypnotic, were examined in the postmarketing surveillance Spontaneous Reporting System of the Food and Drug Administration. Reports for triazolam of confusion, amnesia, bizarre behavior, agitation, and hallucinations were compared with reports of these reactions for temazepam, another short-acting hypnotic. Analysis of individual case reports from marketing through 1985 for triazolam vs temazepam showed 133 vs two for confusion, 109 vs three for amnesia, 59 vs two for bizarre behavior, 58 vs four for agitation, and 40 vs one for hallucinations. Considering extent of use, reporting rates for triazolam were 22 to 99 times those for temazepam, depending on the reaction. Reactions to triazolam tended to occur at higher doses and in older patients. This and an updated analysis of aggregate reports for the first 7 years of marketing of each drug with reporting rates and adjustment for various factors suggest a higher occurrence of these reactions with triazolam, but selection factors cannot be completely ruled out. When treating insomnia, physicians should emphasize sleep hygiene practices as alternatives to drug therapy; if drug therapy is required, they should prescribe hypnotics at the lowest recommended doses for the shortest clinically necessary durations and discontinue medication use should any adverse reactions occur.", 
    "38": "The muscarinic receptors present in the guinea pig tracheobronchial tree were characterized using ligand-binding studies and functional approaches. The binding constants of four selective antagonists, pirenzepine,[11-([2-[(diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3) (1,4) benzodiazepine-6-on] (AF-DX 116), methoctramine, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-Nmethylpiperidine methobromide(4-DAMP) were examined. Heterogeneity in the airway muscarinic receptors population was revealed by competitive binding experiments against [N-methyl3H]scopolamine with the M2 muscarinic antagonists AF-DX 116 and methoctramine. In guinea pig lung and trachea, AF-DX 116 and methoctramine recognized 86-88% and 50-60% of total receptors with high affinity, respectively. These receptors exhibit binding constants for these two compounds similar to those of the M2 subtype. The low-affinity M2 antagonist binding constants were close to those reported for M3 receptors. In lung and trachea, we found no evidence for a high-affinity [N-methyl-3H]pirenzepine binding sites. In functional studies, pirenzepine, methoctramine, and 4-DAMP inhibited the methacholine-induced contraction of lung parenchymal, main bronchial, and tracheal strips with affinities characteristic of smooth muscle M3 receptors. These results are consistent with the presence of M2 and M3 receptors in guinea pig airways. Throughout the airways, the muscarinic receptors mediating smooth muscle contraction are of the M3 subtype.", 
    "39": "An encephalopathy developed in three infants in the intensive care unit after heavy sedation with midazolam and fentanyl for 4 to 11 days. The affected infants had poor social interaction, decreased visual attentiveness, dystonic postures, and choreoathetosis. Symptoms cleared completely in 5 days to 4 weeks. Retrospective review of records of all children treated in the intensive care unit with prolonged intravenous administration of midazolam revealed that 45 children could be assessed neurologically on withdrawal of sedation. Three children had definite and two had possible neurologic sequelae (5/45, 11.1%). All had received concomitant intravenous fentanyl therapy. Neurologic sequelae were significantly associated with young age, female gender, low serum albumin concentration, and concomitant administration of aminophylline. This encephalopathy may represent a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, a prolonged agonist action on the benzodiazepine receptor, or the combined effects of multiple toxic, metabolic, and infectious insults to the central nervous system of infants in the intensive care unit. Prolonged use of intravenous midazolam sedation necessitates careful dosing, monitoring, and discontinuation, particularly in infants and young children.", 
    "40": "Tolerance to opioid-induced sedation has been reported in neonates sedated with fentanyl by continuous infusion while undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We undertook a prospective analysis of eight newborn infants sedated with fentanyl during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy for respiratory failure. We recorded daily mean fentanyl infusion rate, measured serial plasma fentanyl concentrations, and documented the occurrence of spontaneous motor activity or respiratory effort. Mean fentanyl infusion rate increased steadily during the period of infusion from a mean of 9.2 +/- 1.9 (SEM) micrograms/kg per hour on day 1 to a mean of 21.9 +/- 4.5 micrograms/kg per hour by day 6. Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations increased steadily during the period of fentanyl infusion from 3.1 +/- 1.1 (SEM) ng/ml on day 1 to 13.9 +/- 3.2 ng/ml on day 6. All infants exhibited movement in response to gentle tactile stimulation throughout the period of infusion, and seven of eight infants manifested spontaneous movement of the extremities and eye opening. Our results indicate that when fentanyl is used for sedation in neonates, the plasma concentrations required for satisfactory sedation steadily escalate, possibly indicating the rapid development of tolerance to the sedating effects of fentanyl.", 
    "41": "Pharmacological blocking agents are an important treatment approach for the current epidemic of drug abuse. This approach is multidisciplinary, ranging from molecular neuroscience for developing these blocking agents to behavioral therapies for establishing treatment delivery systems. This paper outlines the biological, behavioral, and clinical components of the pharmacological blocking agent approach. Clinical results using two blocking agents, naltrexone for opioid abuse and disulfiram for alcohol abuse, are reviewed as a source of leads in developing potential agents for treating sedative and stimulant abuse. While specific pharmacological antagonists have been developed for benzodiazepines, such agents are not yet available for stimulants. Furthermore, the clinical utility of stimulant antagonists may depend on the development of multisite agents that partially block several neurotransmitter systems rather than target a single-system brain receptor.", 
    "42": "Endozepine is the generic name for a family of peptides that are capable of displacing benzodiazepines and the 3-carboxylate ester of beta-carboline from their specific binding sites on synaptosomal membranes. The 104-amino acid polypeptide diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) generated by tryptic digestion of DBI are two members of the endozepine family. In the present study we have used RIA, HPLC, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical techniques to identify and localize endozepine-like molecules in the rat gastrointestinal tract. Significant amounts of endozepine-like immunoreactivity (LI) were detected throughout the gut; the highest concentrations were found in the duodenum and antrum. HPLC analysis revealed that the immunoreactive material eluted as a major peak with a higher retention time than that of synthetic ODN. The distribution of the immunoreactive peptide(s) was studied using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique at the light microscope level. Endozepine-LI was localized only in the epithelial cell layer of the intestine in both goblet cells and enterocytes. In the stomach, endozepine-LI appeared to be restricted to deep layer of the epithelial cells. The diffuse neuroendocrine cells (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation system) as well as myenteric and neuronal cells were devoid of immunoreactivity. A good correlation was observed between RIA and immunocytochemical data, in that the esophagus, which contained very low concentrations of endozepine-LI, also exhibited weak immunostaining of secretory cells. In situ hybridization using a 35S-labeled cRNA probe showed that endozepine mRNA was located in the mucosa. Taken together, these results show that in the rat, epithelial cells synthesize endozepine-LI material. Since epithelial cells also contain a high density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine-binding sites, our data indicate that endozepines may play a role in water, electrolyte, and/or mucus regulation in the rat gastrointestinal tract. The occurrence of high levels of endozepine-LI in the rat stomach also suggests that endozepines can be involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion through modulation of local gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurotransmission.", 
    "43": "The effects of menstrual cycle phases and gender on alprazolam pharmacokinetics were evaluated in normal volunteers. Alprazolam (1 mg) was administered to seven women during the late follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and to eight men on one occasion. No difference in alprazolam pharmacokinetic parameters was observed during the menstrual cycle phases. Mean alprazolam clearance (+/- SD) was 0.0037 +/- 0.0009 ml/hr during the follicular phase and 0.0036 +/- 0.001 ml/hr during the luteal phase (p greater than 0.05, difference not significant). With use of weight as a covariant, there was no difference in alprazolam pharmacokinetic parameters between women and men. Mean alprazolam clearance (+/- SD) was 0.0036 +/- 0.0009 ml/hr in women compared with 0.0041 +/- 0.0006 ml/hr in men (p greater than 0.05, difference not significant). Although alprazolam metabolism was similar on the 2 days tested, alterations may occur at other times during the menstrual cycle. Further investigation is needed to understand the effects of menstrual cycle phases and gender on drug metabolism.", 
    "44": "Effects of AF-DX 116, a cardioselective antagonist, on M cholinergic receptors (M-ChR) were studied in healthy volunteers. Occupancy of M-ChR subtypes by drug present in plasma samples (radioreceptor assay) was compared with these effects. After an intravenous dose of AF-DX 116 saturating greater than 90% of cardiac M2-ChR, an increase in heart rate by 25 beats/min was observed. This cardiac receptor occupancy and effect wore off with a parallel time course within 10 hours. No inhibition of salivary flow was observed, coinciding with a lack of M3-ChR blockade in the radioreceptor assay. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol did not affect either of the effects. No indication for active metabolites or stereoselective drug metabolism was found comparing HPLC and receptor assay for drug concentrations in plasma. We conclude that AF-DX 116 may be a useful drug for the treatment of bradycardia. Its lack of troublesome side effects is the result of its selectivity for cardiac M-ChR.", 
    "45": "Rectally administered midazolam (0.30 mg/kg) and ketamine (5 mg/kg) were compared for preanesthetic medication in children undergoing dental extractions. Sixty patients between the ages 2 and 9 years were randomly allocated to three groups in this double-blind study. In one group of patients who received ketamine rectally, intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) also was administered immediately after induction of anesthesia. The results from this trial show that 30 minutes after rectal administration of the two drugs, good anxiolysis, sedation, and cooperation were obtained in most patients. Although midazolam appeared to be marginally more efficacious than ketamine in the majority of assessments made and seemed to have less adverse effects, no statistically significant differences could be shown. Ketamine showed a slight decrease and midazolam a slight increase in average blood pressures after premedication. These blood pressure differences were, however, considered to be of little clinical importance.", 
    "46": "Bicarbonate secretion by duodenal mucosa just distal to the Brunner's glands area and devoid of pancreatic secretions was titrated in situ in anesthetized rats. Intravenous injection of diazepam (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased the secretion; this stimulation was abolished by proximal bilateral vagotomy. Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist that also has well-known intrinsic activity, caused similar stimulation of the secretion when administered IV (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg). Intracerebroventricular infusion of Ro 15-1788 (10 micrograms/h) resulted in a greater increase in secretion; again, this stimulation was prevented by vagotomy. Adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine increased basal alkaline secretion but did not affect the stimulation by diazepam. The tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine (2.5 mg/kg IV) did not affect the duodenal bicarbonate secretion. For comparison, effects of diazepam and Ro 15-1788 (10(-6)-10(-4) mol/L) were also tested in isolated bullfrog duodenal mucosa. Neither drug effected the alkaline secretion in vitro. The combined results strongly suggest that benzodiazepines, as previously shown for certain brain peptides, influence the central nervous control of duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion and that their stimulation of secretion is vagally mediated. This action benzodiazepines might be used in modulating mucosal protection against acid.", 
    "47": "In the years 1980-87, 19 cases of severe hypoglycaemia during treatment of Type 2 diabetes with glipizide were reported to the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee. Patient age was 75 +/- 9 years (mean +/- SD) (significantly higher than in all patients on glipizide in Sweden), and the duration of glipizide treatment ranged from 1 day to 4 years. Eleven patients presented with coma, three with reduced consciousness and five with other symptoms. An uneventful early recovery occurred in 14 patients. The remaining five patients had prolonged or recurrent hypoglycaemia for up to 60 h. Two of the patients, both with complicating disorders, died. In a case-control substudy, patients with glipizide-associated hypoglycaemia were found to have renal impairment more often than age- and sex-matched controls treated with glipizide (odds ratio 4.0). The median dose of glipizide (10 mg per day) was identical to that in controls. Other drugs, notably diuretics and benzodiazepines, were more commonly used by hypoglycaemic patients (median 5 vs 2 concomitant drugs, p less than 0.001). We conclude that the use of glipizide is associated with a risk of developing severe hypoglycaemia with a clinical course that is not always benign.", 
    "48": "Cultured astrocytes from rat cortex respond to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by the activation of Cl- channels [Bormann J, Kettenmann H (1988) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85:9336-9340]. The glial response shares many pharmacological properties with those mediated by neuronal GABAA receptors, but differs in its sensitivity to inverse benzodiazepine agonists [Backus KH, Kettenmann H, Schachner M (1988) Glia 1:132-140]. To compare glial GABA receptors further with their neuronal counterparts, we analysed the effect of steroids, which have recently been shown to modulate neuronal GABAA-receptor-mediated responses, on GABA-induced currents in astrocytes. The agonist allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) at concentrations of 100 nM and 1 microM enhanced GABA-evoked (with 10 microM GABA) currents up to 115% and 162.4% of controls respectively. The antagonist dehydroisoandrosterone 3-sulphate (DHEAS) at concentrations of 1 microM, and 100 microM depressed GABA-evoked (10 microM) currents to 72%, 42.8% and 21.4% of controls respectively. The steroids were less effective at higher GABA concentrations. 100 microM DHEAS directly elicited a membrane current, while THDOC (1 microM) did not exert any direct response. This study demonstrates that steroids modulate GABA-evoked currents and thus may interfere with any of the functions of glial GABA receptors that are at present under discussion.",

The AP was measured with an aneroid sphygmomanometer, in mmHg, in orthostatic position, before and after 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes of treatment. The heart rate in one minute was also measured at the same intervals. The patients were divided randomly into four groups and treated, respectively, with 10 mg of diazepam, 10 mg of nifedipine, 40 mg of propranolol and 10 mg of nifedipine associated with 40 mg of propranolol.",

    "53": "A trapezoidal area method for simulating physiological pharmacokinetics of drugs in animals is proposed. Concentrations of ethoxybenzamide in rat tissues and diazepam in human plasma were simulated. The results showed that profiles of concentrations vs time in the body with this method were in a good agreement with those obtained with the Rang-Katta method. As compared with the Rang-Katta method, the present method has two special advantages: the time course of drug concentration in tissue can be estimated using simple equations and the speed for simulation is faster.", 
    "54": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in food intake was investigated in rats by using BIM-18216, a novel CCK receptor antagonist. In rats fed 6 hr/day, BIM-18216 antagonized the reduction of food intake induced by exogenous CCK octapeptide (CCK-8; 4 micrograms/kg) in a dose-dependent manner and had a maximum effect at 1 mg/kg. BIM-18216 did not antagonize the effect of bombesin on food intake and showed some degree of specificity. BIM-18216 was not able to prevent the effect of endogenous CCK at the beginning of the feeding period. These data demonstrate that BIM-18216 is a potent CCK-specific antagonist. These results also suggest that endogenous and exogenous CCK could act by different regulating pathways.", 
    "55": "As fast-acting, water-soluble compounds, like midazolam (MID) are increasingly used in anesthetic practice, the need for quick and effective reversal of benzodiazepine actions in accidental overdoses is obvious. Quite a few drugs have been used in both animal models and clinically towards this aim, including: physostigmine (PHYS), naloxone (NAL), aminophylline, doxapram, in the past and, more recently, flumazenil (FLU) or Ro-15-1788. In the present study we assessed the relative potency, safety and efficacy of the antagonistic actions of PHYS (0.06 and 0.6 mg/kg), NAL (2 mg/kg) and FLU (2.5 mg/kg) on the state of sleep induced by MID (2.5 mg/kg) in 50 male, drug-naive rats. Time of induction of anesthesia and duration of sleep were measured with digital chronometer. Level of consciousness was determined by pain reactivity, spontaneous motor activity and computer-aided analysis of cumulative EEG patterns. Times obtained were integrated as mean values and statistical analysis was made using the t-test (Student's criterion). Rats were given MID followed 30 min later by an i.p. injection of either vehicle (VEH = water for injection = control group) or low-dose PHYS or high-dose PHYS or NAL or FLU (n = 10 in each group). We measured the duration of anesthesia following the injection of each antagonist. The following results were obtained: [table: see text] Thus, the relative potency scale of MID antagonism in this series of experiments is: FLU = High-dose PHYS greater than low-dose PHYS much greater than NAL VEH. Although FLU has a strong duration and rapid awakening action, this action is of short duration and the animals are resedated after 33.3 +/- 7.14 min. PHYS does not appear to show this resedation effect, while in high doses is equipotent to FLU. Nevertheless, in these excessive doses, the animals become restless and excited, showing phenomena of an acute, severe nicotinic crisis. In conclusion, FLU appears to have much more specific and reliable effects upon reversing MID-induced anesthesia in comparison to either PHYS or NAL. In fact, PHYS must reach toxic levels to counteract MID effects, while FLU is very safe. The existence of the resedation effect is due to the short t1/2 of FLU and can be overcome by continuous i.v. infusions or repeated bolus injections.", 
    "56": "Attending physicians routinely encounter patients with signs and symptoms of anxiety and mood disorders as well as psychoactive substance use and psychoactive substance-induced organic mental disorders. These symptoms may represent either primary disorders or pathology that is secondary to other disorders. This article describes some of the relationships between substance use disorders and symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders. In addition, some patients with these disorders may have a concurrent substance use disorder or be at high risk for developing one. Routine treatment of anxiety disorders with psychoactive drugs can be successful in many patients but may lead to iatrogenic dependence in high-risk patients. Prescribing for high-risk patients should include a stepwise treatment protocol having three progressive levels: (1) conservative, nonpharmacological approaches; (2) nonpsychoactive pharmacotherapy, including the use of anxioselective agents, such as buspirone; and (3) psychoactive pharmacotherapy, such as the use of benzodiazepines. Proper prescribing practices for high-risk patients are described in terms of diagnosis, dosage, duration, discontinuation, dependence, and documentation.", 
    "57": "Insomnia is a commonly encountered condition in clinical practice. The prevalence of self-reported poor sleep increases with age and is more common in women. There are clear associations between poor sleep and psychiatric disturbance; however, causality in this regard may be complex, and there are at least some insomniacs who show high somatic tension without marked psychopathology. The development of chronic insomnia can be conceptualized as involving predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. Pharmacological treatments for insomnia most typically involve judicious and intermittent usage of a benzodiazepine hypnotic. A variety of such medications are available, with varying absorption and elimination characteristics. Benzodiazepines are preferred over antidepressants in the treatment of insomnia in individuals without major psychiatric disorder because of fewer side effects and a larger margin of safety. Nonpharmacological treatments typically rely on elements of sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and chronotherapy. The establishment of good patient-clinician rapport and the working through of unfounded beliefs and unrealistic expectations of the sleep experience are also important components of the behavioral treatment of insomnia. Use of such techniques, particularly when combined in a treatment package, has shown appreciable benefits in improving sleep.", 
    "58": "Panic disorders are medical conditions requiring an eclectic treatment approach that often combines pharmacotherapeutics with education, cognitive-behavior therapy, and psychodynamic therapy. This article focuses on the management of medication within this framework. The medications that have been found to be effective include tricyclic antidepressants, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and higher potency benzodiazepines. Although alprazolam is the most studied medication and acts very rapidly, each type of medication has unique advantages and liabilities. The general treatment strategy with all the medications is to start with a low dose and increase it slowly until side effects develop or panic attacks cease. The treatment approach should be oriented toward a chronic illness that often requires long-term medication.", 
    "59": "The physician who prescribes controlled substances is faced with an array of laws, regulatory policies, and professional attitudes about their use. Prescriptions for these scheduled drugs are furthermore monitored by the pharmacists who dispense them. Certain drugs, such as the opioids and the benzodiazepines, are considered so potentially abusive that special programs have been recommended to track the behavior of physician prescribers. Multiple copy programs have been implemented in some states. More recent proposals recommend electronic data transfer (EDT) of pharmacy information to centralized processing points so that misprescribing physicians and doctor-shopping patients can be identified. Regulators concerned about physician behavior and confronted by demands of nonphysicians to prescribe controlled substances may find EDT a good solution. Physicians should be concerned about being censured for misprescribing, because such actions may lead to inclusion in the National Practitioner Data Bank. With all of the regulatory concerns about controlled substances, those physicians who would employ long-term opioid therapy for their chronic pain patients must follow certain basic guidelines to be able to defend themselves against allegations of deviant professional behavior. Such procedures as conducting a history and physical examination, maintaining a written treatment plan, consulting with knowledgeable colleagues, and assessing for addictive behavior can provide the practitioner with safeguards.", 
    "60": "The effect of alinidine, a bradycardic agent, on the vasodilator responses to acetylcholine was examined in isolated and perfused dog coronary arteries. Single injections of acetylcholine (10(-12)-10(-6) mol) and carbachol (10(-10)-10(-6) mol) produced dose-dependent vasodilations. The endothelial removal by a bolus injection of saponin (1 mg) inhibited those vasodilations. Alinidine (10(-6) M) shifted the dose-response curves of acetylcholine and carbachol to the right, but it did not affect those for isosorbide dinitrate, isoproterenol and adenosine. The rank order of potency of muscarinic antagonists for inhibiting the acetylcholine-induced vasodilation was 4-DAMP greater than or equal to atropine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than or equal to pirenzepine greater than alinidine. Alinidine was approximately 100 times less potent than atropine. Single injection of alinidine (10(-8)-10(-6) mol) dilated the dog coronary artery in a dose-related manner. The vasodilation was not affected by the pretreatment with phentolamine (10(-6) M), pindolol (10(-6) M), atropine (10(-6) M), chlorpheniramine (10(-6) M), cimetidine (10(-6) M) or methysergide (10(-6) M). These results suggest that alinidine has a weak anti-muscarinic effect on the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the dog coronary artery.", 
    "61": "The effect of propranolol (PPL), phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) or bicuculline (BCL) on the diazepam (DZP)-induced changes of pineal melatonin synthesis in male rats was examined in vivo and in vitro. Administration of PBZ did not affect the inhibitory action of DZP on pineal melatonin synthesis in vivo. A single injection of PPL inhibited the pineal melatonin synthesis similarly to the administration of DZP alone, but the two drugs together did not exhibit additive or synergistic effects on the melatonin synthesis. Significant decreases in the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and the N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and melatonin contents were observed in the BCL-injected group, being greater than those in the DZP-treated group. Unexpectedly, however, the combination treatment of DZP and BCL causes an increase in the NAT activity and melatonin content compared with the BCL-alone group. Incubation with DZP at higher concentrations resulted in an increase of pineal NAT activity in vitro, but this increase was inhibited by preincubation with PPL, PBZ or BCL. DZP treatment thus appeared to have different effects on pineal NAT activity in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that both a GABAergic mechanism and peripheral benzodiazepine (BZP) receptors in rat pineal gland may be involved in the modulation of melatonin synthesis by DZP.", 
    "62": "The effect of diazepam (DZP) on melatonin synthesis in rat pineal gland was investigated in vivo. Subcutaneous injection of DZP (3 mg/kg) 1 h before the start of darkness significantly suppressed nocturnal elevations of pineal N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and melatonin contents in rats, and caused a 2-h delay in reaching the maximum melatonin level in the dark phase. DZP treatment also markedly suppressed the dark-induced increase of pineal N-acetyltransferase activity, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in melatonin synthesis, but had no effect on hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity, which catalyzes the final step of melatonin formation. Pineal norepinephrine and dopamine contents, in contrast, were not altered by DZP injection. The distribution rate of DZP to the brain reached the highest level 30 min after a single injection, while that to the pineal gland was observed 5 h later (i.e., 4 h after the start of darkness). It is clear that the inhibitory effect of DZP on melatonin synthesis in rat pineal gland appears concomitantly with the increase in the distribution volume of DZP into this gland. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of DZP on melatonin synthesis results from the drug's direct action on the rat pineal gland.", 
    "63": "The repeated administration of subconvulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) produced a progressive sensitization to the effects of this compound (i.e., chemical kindling) in the rat. A very similar time-course for PTZ-induced kindling was observed using two different treatment schedules: 1) one injection every day (30 mg/kg, IP), and 2) one injection (30 mg/kg, IP) every second day. When these treatment schedules were used for eight consecutive weeks, more than 80% of the rats displayed convulsions by the end of treatment. In contrast, only 20% of the rats were sensitized if PTZ was administered twice daily at the dose of 15 mg/kg, IP. The increased sensitivity to the convulsant effect of PTZ was still present one year after completion of the chronic treatment. Moreover, rats kindled with PTZ showed an enhanced susceptibility to convulsions induced by different inhibitors of central GABAergic function, such as the chloride channel blocker picrotoxin, the benzodiazepine receptor ligands FG 7142 and Ro 15-4513, and the inhibitor of GABA synthesis isoniazid. In contrast, the sensitivity to the convulsant action of the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine was unchanged by repeated PTZ administration. It is suggested that kindling produced by PTZ may be associated with a persistent reduction in the inhibitory function of the GABAergic system in the brain.", 
    "64": "Primary cultures enriched in neurons dissociated from embryonic rat cerebra were used to demonstrate that platelet activating factor and the structurally related ether glycerolipid, dodecylglycerol, are readily taken up in small amounts by neurons and that they stimulate the differentiation of neurons. The stimulation of neuronal differentiation was observed as a precocious development of axon-like extensions which correlated with a concentration-dependent increase in neuronal-specific enzyme activities. This stimulation of morphological and neurochemical factors by either platelet activating factor or dodecylglycerol was almost completely abolished by triazolam, a known inhibitor of platelet activating factor function. Neither platelet activating factor nor dodecylglycerol at the concentrations used to achieve stimulation of neuronal differentiation compromised the plasma membrane, as indicated by the lack of leakage of cytoplasmic lactic acid dehydrogenase.", 
    "65": "Previous studies demonstrated that pancreatic enzyme secretion in rats is stimulated by the diversion of pancreatic juice from the duodenum or by the inhibition of pancreatic proteinases in the intestinal lumen but little attention has been paid to the role of gastric secretion in this stimulation. This study, carried out on conscious rats with large gastric (GF) and pancreatic fistulas, confirms that diversion of pancreatic juice in rats with the GF closed results in the progressive stimulation of pancreatic secretion reaching the maximum similar to that induced by exogenous CCK. When the GF was kept open, the diversion resulted in only small increment in pancreatic secretion and this was accompanied by progressive increase in gastric acid outputs. Similar amounts of HCl (25-400 mumol/h) instilled intraduodenally (i.d.) in rats with the GF open fully reproduced the increase in pancreatic secretion observed after the diversion of pancreatic juice and this effect was completely abolished by the pretreatment with L-364,718, a specific CCK receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with omeprazole to suppress completely gastric acid secretion in the diverted state resulted in a decline in pancreatic secretion similar to that observed after opening the GF. Camostate given in graded doses (6-200 mg/kg) either i.d. or s.c. in rats with pancreatic juice returned to the duodenum caused a dose-dependent increase in pancreatic secretion, but after opening the GF or after omeprazole this increase was reduced by about 50% while after L-364,718 it was abolished. This study provides evidence that gastric secretion plays an important role in the pancreatic response to diversion of pancreatic juice or inhibition of luminal proteinases (but not to feeding) and the elimination of gastric acid reduces this response.", 
    "66": "Rationalisation of the war of hypnotics has recently been under discussion in France: a review of the benefits and risks of these substances may therefore be useful. Chronic insomnia is a result of multiple factors, among which individual characteristics of the personality play an important role. Hypnotic treatment is symptomatic; its beneficial influence on sleep progressively vanishes in few weeks, while some negative residual effects on daytime functioning (mood, alertness, performance, memory impairment) may persist. The main problems posed by hypnotic treatment with benzodiazepines are related to tolerance effects during the treatment period and to rebound insomnia and withdrawal phenomena after discontinuation. Practical issues for the treatment of insomnia, based on international consensus, are presented.", 
    "67": "A computer program is described for deconvoluting the overlap which is often found in mass spectral peak abundance data from stable isotope experiments. Peak intensity data from calibration standards are corrected using parameters calculated from the analysis of separate external standard solutions of analytes and internal standard. If the calibration data are satisfactory, the same parameters and the slope and intercept values from the least squares analysis of the calibration data are used to correct and quantitate the mass spectral peak intensity data from the quality assurance and experimental samples. Reports and graphs appropriate to the process are produced. Applications are given for the analysis of plasma samples from stable isotope experiments with carprofen, cifenline, and midazolam.", 
    "68": "The purpose of this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of diazepam in monkeys following an im injection of 100 micrograms/kg (the minimum effective dose that prevents nerve agent-induced convulsions in pyridostigmine-pretreated, atropine- and 2-PAM-treated monkeys) in order to predict what im dose in humans is needed to prevent nerve agent-induced convulsions. Six rhesus monkeys were administered diazepam in the hind limb. Blood (3 mL) was collected via an indwelling saphenous catheter immediately prior to and 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min after diazepam dosing. A contract laboratory, blind to the labeling code, analyzed diazepam serum concentrations by electron-capture gas chromatography and the percentage of unbound diazepam by equilibrium dialysis. The concentration-time data for total (unbound and bound) diazepam individually determined for each animal was best described by a one-compartment open model with first-order absorption and elimination. The average maximum serum concentration (50 ng/mL) was reached in 29 min. The volume of distribution and systemic clearance, assuming 100% bioavailability, were 1.5 L/kg and 19.4 mL/min/kg, respectively. The percentage of diazepam unbound to serum proteins was 4.6% and, therefore, the maximum concentration of free diazepam was 2.3 ng/mL. These results, when compared with human pharmacokinetic studies, allow a means of extrapolating effective monkey anticonvulsant doses to humans on a pharmacokinetic basis.", 
    "69": "The concentration-EEG effect relationship of midazolam in the rat was studied from a population perspective. Plasma concentration and EEG effect data from 27 rats were available for analysis. Effect parameters derived from aperiodic EEG analysis were used as effect parameters. The population analysis gave results that were similar to the sample theory estimates (means s and SDs) obtained from the fits to individual data sets. Reanalysis of the EEG data using mean population pharmacokinetic parameters as input to the pharmacodynamic model led to poorer estimation of the pharmacodynamic parameters: particularly EC50. Inclusion of one observed plasma concentration per individual significantly improved the estimation of the pharmacodynamic parameters and led to results that were virtually indistinguishable from those obtained using complete pharmacokinetic data.", 
    "70": "The effects of two benzodiazepines, diazepam and alprazolam, have been evaluated on the in vitro antibacterial activity exerted by human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Results demonstrate that diazepam has no influence on this PBL function, while alprazolam is able to enhance this activity in six out of nine normal donors considered. The possible therapeutical implications of these data are discussed.", 
    "71": "Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are psychotropic drugs largely used in patients with affective disorders. As far as their effects on the immune system are concerned, a few studies have been carried out until now. Diazepam is inhibitory in vitro for the phagocytic functions and the antibody synthesis, being its action mediated via specific receptors on immunocompetent cells. On the contrary, alprazolam results to be enhancing for the antibacterial activity exerted by normal human peripheral blood T lymphocytes in vitro. Taken together, these data point out the different role which BDZ play on the immune response.", 
    "72": "Spinal cord seizures are infrequently reported. They have been associated with intravenous dye placement, transverse myelitis and multiple sclerosis, but never with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). We report the case of a 48-year-old SCI male with complete C6 quadriplegia, and apparent spinal cord seizures. These seizures were characterised by myoclonus simplex activity involving the upper extremities only. The lower extremities were spared. The patient was conscious throughout the myoclonic activity and an electroencephalogram of the brain obtained during an event revealed no cortical epiliptiform activity. The seizures lasted approximately 30 seconds to a few minutes, and an acute increase in blood pressure and a decrease in pulse generally occurred 30 to 60 seconds prior to the event. Previously reported spinal cord seizures in multiple sclerosis were frequently treated with carbamazepine. In this case successful treatment was with diazepam. Spinal cord seizures may present in those with traumatic SCI. Benzodiazepines may be useful in the treatment of spinal cord seizures.", 
    "73": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the bronchodilating effect of pirenzepine (PZ) and to verify its mechanism. Ten asthmatic patients (6 men, 4 women: aged 20 to 65, 5 atopic 5 non-atopic) and ten non-asthmatic volunteers (8 men, 2 women: aged 25 to 60) were studied. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1.0) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured after intravenous administration of 20 mg PZ. PZ increased FVC, FEV1.0 and PEFR significantly by 15%, 29% and 37% respectively in asthmatic patients (p less than 0.01). We also studied the effects of PZ on the contractile responses of tracheal smooth muscle to intra-arterially administered acetylcholine (ACh) and the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves (VNS) using isometric technique in situ in 5 mongrel dogs. PZ significantly inhibited the contractile responses elicited with ACh at doses larger than 1000 micrograms/kg (p less than 0.01). PZ also significantly inhibited the contractile responses elicited by VNS at doses larger than 100 micrograms/kg (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that intravenously administered PZ dilates the airway in asthmatic patients and also suggest that the bronchodilating effect of PZ related to inhibition of the M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "74": "We investigated the influence of different oral premedication given to 50 male and 50 female patients on the plasmaconcentration of free fatty acids (FFA) as an indicator of preoperative stress and compared them with patients given no premedication at all. FFA are measured with a gaschromatographic method. FFA were measured four times: Time 1 (t1): the first day in hospital, t2: After the anesthesiologist's visit, t3: In the morning of the operation, t4: Before starting anesthesia. The groups are: I. 20 male and 20 female patients without any premedication; II. every 10 patients of both sexes given 2 mg Flunitrazepam (p.o.) on the preoperative night; III. every 10 patients given Morphium (0.15 mg i.m.) and Promethazin (50 mg i.m.) and, last, IV. every 10 patients getting the same premedication as group II and IV. 98 patients had a significant decrease of FFA from t1 to t2. The FFA of all increased from t2 to t3. Moreover, there was an increase from t3 to t4. We conclude from this that no premedication we had investigated is able to lower the physiological and biochemical stress-response as far as shown by FFA. Apart from myristic-acid, there was no difference in the groups. However, with no statistic significance, both 'Flunitrazepam-groups' showed the lowest increase. Further, in 28 from 32 cases, females had a higher FFA-level than males (in 16 cases with statistical significance).", 
    "75": "Postoperative pain relief and sedation with epidural midazolam-saline or midazolam-bupivacaine were studied in 46 patients after elective upper abdominal surgery. They were divided into 6 groups. In each group, 10 ml saline, 10 ml saline+midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1, 10 ml saline+midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1 (saline group), 0.25% bupivacaine 6 ml, 0.25% bupivacaine 6 ml + midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 or 0.25% bupivacaine 6 ml + midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1 (bupivacaine group) was administered via epidural catheter for complaint of pain. For 120 minutes after epidural injection, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), sedation score, and serum concentration of midazolam (conc midazolam) were evaluated. The time interval until next complaint of pain (pain relief time) was measured. In midazolam injected group, BP, HR, RR were not changed from preinjection value, but sufficient sedation was obtained and pain relief time was significantly prolonged compared with saline or bupivacaine injected group. Midazolam level was lower than that of sedation level. There were no significant differences between saline group and bupivacaine group, but the pain relief effect was slightly stronger in bupivacaine group. It is concluded that epidural saline - midazolam or 0.25% bupivacaine - midazolam is useful for postoperative pain relief after upper abdominal surgery.", 
    "76": "Although patients with trigeminal neuralgia can be treated satisfactorily with nerve blocks, the block procedure is sometimes very painful and uncomfortable for them. To investigate the efficacy and adverse effects of midazolam as a premedicant for trigeminal nerve blocks, 19 patients were randomly assigned to receive either midazolam (0.05 mg.kg-1, n = 6), midazolam (0.1 mg.kg-1, n = 7), or saline/placebo (n = 6) before the block. The patients given midazolam (0.1 mg.kg-1) had a significantly lower incidence of recalling the block procedure and had complained of less discomfort when interviewed the following day. No serious adverse effects were observed in any patient given midazolam. Midazolam can be used safely as an effective premedicant for potentially uncomfortable procedures such as trigeminal nerve blocks.", 
    "77": "Fifteen subjects (9 men and 6 women) exhibiting objective evidence of excessive daytime somnolence and periodic leg movements in sleep underwent 4-7 days of treatment with triazolam (0.25 or 0.50 mg) and placebo in a double-blind crossover design. One night of polysomnography followed by daytime multiple sleep latency testing were conducted on the first and last days of each treatment block. By the last day of treatment, the mean multiple sleep latency test score after triazolam (9.0 minutes) was significantly greater than that after placebo (5.7 minutes). Thus, triazolam treatment led to a decrease in daytime somnolence. Triazolam also improved sleep architecture and continuity; it increased total sleep time, decreased the number of awakenings and arousals, and decreased stage 1 and increased stage 2 percentages. Although the frequency of periodic electromyographic bursts remained unchanged, the frequency of associated arousals decreased after treatment. Short-term treatment with triazolam is thus effective in diminishing daytime sleepiness and in improving sleep architecture, continuity and duration in patients with periodic leg movements in sleep. These effects do not seem to be mediated through a decrease in periodic leg movement activity.", 
    "78": "A gas chromatograph/Fourier transform-infrared spectrometric analysis of benzophenones, as hydrolyzed products of benzodiazepine, was evaluated and the vapor phase spectra obtained were compared with those measured in the condensed phase. Each infrared spectrum obtained in the vapor phase showed a much greater difference in comparison to differences found in those in the condensed phase, especially in the fingerprint region. The identification of 14 benzophenones by their infrared spectra in the vapor phase was possible. The detection limits for these benzophenones were between 50-100 ng with high signal-to-noise ratios. The vapor phase spectra of the benzophenones were unique and the analytical method allowed the differentiation of closely related classes of drugs, such as benzophenones.", 
    "79": "The combination of oral and intravenous sedation has not been well investigated and this study examined the combination's effect on amnesia, anxiety, cardiovascular stability and recovery in a double blind, cross-over, placebo controlled trial. Patients were given 7.5 mg oral midazolam or placebo 1 h prior to intravenous midazolam and surgery. This investigation demonstrated significant anxiolysis, amnesia and patient preference for oral midazolam compared to placebo. There was no significant effect on cardiovascular stability, the intravenous dose of midazolam used or post-operative recovery. Low dose oral midazolam prior to intravenous sedation may be beneficial in very anxious patients, particularly if surgery is delayed.", 
    "80": "Patients receive on average 10 different drugs while in hospital; when fewer than 6 are administered the probability of an adverse drug interaction is about 5%, but when more than 15 are given the probability increases to over 40%. Patients presenting for anaesthesia and surgery are likely to receive multiple preoperative drug therapy and also many perioperative medications as part of their anaesthetic regimen. Thus, there is a considerable potential for interactions to occur in anaesthetic practice. Pharmacokinetic interactions occur when the administration of 1 drug alters the disposition of another, and hence alters the concentration of drug at the receptor site, leading to altered drug response. These changes in drug concentration at the receptor site may be produced by alteration of (a) drug absorption and uptake into the body, (b) drug distribution, (c) drug metabolism and (d) drug elimination or excretion by nonmetabolic routes. Interactions affecting the absorption of orally administered medications are often due to the indirect effect of 1 drug on gastric motility and emptying, which leads to reduced, delayed or variable systemic drug availability. Gastric emptying time before elective surgery is normal, but premedication with morphine, pethidine (meperidine) and anticholinergics all delay gastric emptying and hence drug absorption. Inhalational anaesthesia of short duration does not appear to affect drug absorption, although halothane anaesthetic used for longer periods produces a slight delay in gastric emptying. Volatile anaesthetics have been shown to delay the intramuscular absorption of ketamine. Anaesthetic agents may affect drug distribution, and peak concentrations of propranolol, for example, are 4 times higher during halothane anaesthesia in dogs, accompanied by a marked decrease in volume of distribution. This effect has been noted for other drugs, including thiopental and verapamil. Volatile anaesthetics also affect plasma protein binding, leading to displacement interactions in some cases. Volatile anaesthetics affect the metabolism of concomitantly administered drug (a) by altering the rate of delivery to the organ of clearance (e.g. decreasing hepatic blood flow) and (b) by altering the activity of drug metabolising enzymes. It is now well recognised that all the volatile anaesthetics currently in use inhibit the metabolism of a large variety of drugs, e.g. propranolol, lidocaine (lignocaine), fentanyl and pethidine. Other examples of interactions of clinical importance to anaesthesiologists include those between cimetidine and the local anaesthetics and benzodiazepines; inhibition of plasma cholinesterase by drugs such as ecothiopate; interactions between monoamine oxidase inhibitors and sympathomimetics or pethidine and between monoamine oxidase inhibitors and sympathomimetics or pethidine and between isoniazid and enflurane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "81": "An open, randomized, cross-over study involving 24 healthy volunteers, shows that a novel formulation of temazepam (temazepam Gelthix, TG) in soft gelatin capsules designed to resist i.v. abuse has a similar pharmacokinetic (P-K) profile to that of a liquid-filled, reference formulation (TL) when administered as a single oral dose of 20 mg. The relative bioavailability of the two formulations assessed in terms of the area under the time versus plasma concentration profile (AUC), although statistically different (P less than 0.05), is well within the acceptable 80-120% limits for bioequivalence. Although the mean Cmax for TG (616.6 ng/ml) is lower than for TL (707.9 ng/ml) and the median time to reach Cmax (Tmax) is 40 min (TG) vs. 30 min (TL), there is no significant difference between TG and TL either in their absorption constant (Ka) (0.123 vs. 0.138 min-1 respectively) or their distribution (a) (29.5 vs. 32.4 min) and elimination (beta) (6.3 vs. 6.6 h) half-lives (t1/2). Thus the essential P-K characteristics for the use of temazepam as a hypnotic and premedicant, specifically a rapid rise followed by a prompt fall in blood levels, are conserved by the Gelthix formulation.", 
    "82": "Analgo-sedation for ESWL treatment has been associated with a variety of problems. Minimal invasiveness of this technique should combine with haemodynamic stability as well as with adequate oxygenation. Patient acceptance has to be considered as another important aspect. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of an analgosedative regimen with regard to these aspects. 50 ASA I-III patients scheduled for ESWL treatment were randomly allocated to receive either no premedication (n = 25) or chlorazepam as oral premedication (n = 25). The analgosedative technique was identical in both groups, consisting of atropine 0.25 mg, droperidol 5 mg (2.5 mg, if body weight less than 60 kg), and alfentanil 10 micrograms/kg intravenously. If necessary, repeated boluses of alfentanil 5 micrograms/kg were administered up to a maximum of 2 mg. Heart rates, arterial blood pressures, and peripheral oxygen saturation were measured during treatment. Post-treatment, patients were interviewed to assess the quality of analgesia. The results showed that our analgo-sedative regimen is suitable for ASA I-III patients. Stable heamodynamic conditions and adequate oxygenation were achieved in all patients. Patient acceptance was good. Patients with anxiolytic premedication benefited in terms of reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. The study also showed that anaesthesiologists may underestimate the pain intensity experienced and assessed by the patient.", 
    "83": "1 The affinity of some muscarinic antagonists for muscarinic receptors was determined in functional isolated tissue studies in order to compare the muscarinic receptor subtypes in the rabbit. 2 Our attention was specially focused on the question of whether the muscarinic receptors mediating vasodilatation in the aorta resemble or not the ones present on the jejunum of the gastrointestinal tract. 3 Isolated aorta, jejunum, stimulated left atrium and vas deferens preparations of rabbit were investigated with the following muscarinic antagonists: atropine, pirenzepine, methoctramine (N,N'-bis[6-92-methoxybenzyl)amino hexyl]-1,8-octane-diamine tetrahydrochloride) and 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide). 4 The results demonstrate that the receptors on aorta are unlike those on the other rabbit tissues: pirenzepine pA2 was 6.4 on aorta but 8.1 on vas deferens; methoctramine pA2 was 5.9 on aorta but 7.1 on heart; 4-DAMP pA2 was 8.7 on aorta and 8.0 on jejunum. This raises the question: what subtype might be involved?", 
    "84": "In an effort to define the role that substance abuse has to play in head injuries, a prospective study of 204 patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department over a 10-week period was carried out. Urine samples were collected and assayed for the presence of common drugs of abuse and alcohol. One or other substance (drugs or alcohol) was detected in 43% of patients. The association between alcohol and head injuries has been confirmed and the importance of drugs in this area has been addressed and found to be of some significance. More rapid and accurate methods of assaying these substances may improve our management of head injury patients.", 
    "85": "The haemodynamic responses following induction of anaesthesia with ketamine and midazolam have not been determined previously. Twenty adult patients for elective myocardial revascularization were randomized to two regimens for induction of anaesthesia. Patients in Group I received ketamine, 2 mg.kg-1, and midazolam, 0.2 mg.kg-1 and those in Group II received ketamine, 2 mg.kg-1, and midazolam, 0.4 mg.kg-1. Measurements were recorded at baseline, 1 min post-induction, and at one, three, five and ten minutes after tracheal intubation. Tachycardia and hypertension (greater than 20% increases from awake baseline values) were treated with esmolol, 250 micrograms.kg-1. There were 11 patients in Group I and nine patients in Group II. There were no significant intergroup differences in demographic or haemodynamic variables. Both groups had decreases (P less than 0.05), in stroke volume, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and right ventricular end-diastolic volume at multiple study intervals following anaesthetic induction. None of these changes required clinical intervention. Five patients (all in Group II) had hypertensive responses to tracheal intubation. Preoperative hypertension (mean arterial pressure greater than or equal to 100 mmHg) was a predictor (P less than 0.05) of a hypertensive response to intubation, independent of the midazolam dose. Intravenous ketamine and midazolam was associated with a high incidence (25%) of haemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation. The higher dose of midazolam did not provide any haemodynamic advantage.", 
    "86": "Two elderly patients with musical hallucinations are described. In the first case, the musical hallucinations were precipitated by the administration of benzodiazepines. The symptoms in the second case resembled those described in cases of visual hallucinosis (Charles Bonnet syndrome) in the elderly. Issues related to the presentation and course of musical hallucinations are discussed.", 
    "87": "The effects of diazepam (DZ) and the beta-carbolines ZK-91296 and ZK-93423 on luteinizing hormone (LH) release evoked by beta-estradiol were studied in estradiol-primed ovariectomized rats. Acute treatment with 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg DZ and ZK-91296 significantly blunted the LH response. ZK-93423 (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg) produced a similar effect. The inverse agonist DMCM (2 mg/kg) was unable to modify plasma LH levels in estrogen-primed, ovariectomized rats. Sedative effects were observed with doses of DZ (1 mg/kg) ineffective to blunt the LH response. In contrast, ZK-91296 (5 mg/kg) produced inhibition of LH surges in nonsedative doses. These results indicate that diazepam and beta-carboline agonists prevent the LH surge evoked by estrogen. They suggest, in addition, that the actions on LH release and their sedative effects are not directly related."
