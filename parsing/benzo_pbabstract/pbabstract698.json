    "0": "Drug treatment appears to have induced the manifestation of undetected enzymopathy in 4 case studies. 2 patients had acute intermittent porphyria and 2 had Gilbert's syndrome. In acute intermittent porphyria, the effects of enzyme inducers may overproduce DALA-synthetase which may lead to an acute porphyria attack. In Gilbert's syndrome, enzyme activity is hormone-dependent and studies have shown that synthetic estrogens are inhibitory to conjugation with glucuronide. Therefore, drug use may result in the manifestation of hereditary or genetic defects.", 
    "1": "Laboratory evaluation of illicit drug abuse was conducted in a major correctional institution. Fifty-eight prison inmates were screened for common drugs of abuse in conjunction with a triazolo-benzodiazipine compound tolerance protocol. Urine specimens were collected on days -1, 1, 15, 29, and 49 and assayed for amphetamines, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol. Quinine was detected in two individuals and was probably derived from cold remedy preparations rather than the illegal use of heroin. While occasional illicit drugs may find their way into a prison population, this study showed no evidences of drug abuse in one correctional institution whose prisoners participated in Phase I drug evaluations.", 
    "2": "A study of the feto-maternal distribution of diazepam is presented. 10 pregnant women received 10 mg of diazepem intramuscularly as a premedication prior to abortion by hysterotomy. The drug was found in all fetal and maternal samples taken 40-120 minutes after injection. The feto-maternal ratio of diazepam concentration was 1.2, whereas ratios of 1.8 have been found at labor. All tissue samples from the fetal brain liver, and placenta contained diazepam, the the concentrations were lower than fetal-plasma concentrations. The lowest concentration was found in fetal brain tissue. Diazepam was not found in the amniotic fluid, but it has been detected with carbon-14-labeled diazepam.", 
    "3": "Two new benzodiazepines, potassium clorazepate (15 mg. at night), and lorazepam (1 mg. t.d.s.) were compared in 50 patients presenting with anxiety in general practice. The response to treatment was assessed clinically and for patient acceptance. The single-dose regime of potassium clorazepate was significantly better, both for clinical effectiveness and patient acceptance. In the potassium clorazepate treated group there were significantly fewer side-effects. In particular, sedation was a problem with lorazepam, 6 patients stopping treatment and 8 voluntarily reducing the dose. Only 2 patients stopped treatment because of the sedative effect of potassium clorazepate. The sedative effects also show qualitative differences: in patients who completed the assessment lorazepam caused mainly daylong sedation and potassium clorazepate mid-day sedation, and when asked for their opinion on the value of sedation, only the potassium clorazepate group considered it to be beneficial.", 
    "4": "The effects on the respiratory function of two tranquillising drugs, lorazepam and diazepam, have been compared in 20 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Both drugs induce a respiratory depression (decrease in tidal volume and minute ventilation with acceleration of the respiratory frequency) with slight respiratory acidosis, but lorazepam causes no significant hypoxemia and has a shorter duration of action than diazepam. Nevertheless, if tranquillisers are indicated in such patients, they have to be used with care."
