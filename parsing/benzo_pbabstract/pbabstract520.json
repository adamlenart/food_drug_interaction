Macroscopically visible bleeding was the criterion of stress bleeding. In addition, special attention was also paid to any signs of pneumonia. There was a significantly higher incidence of gastric pH values of less than 4 in the pirenzepine patients. Six episodes of bleeding occurred in the ranitidine group vs. three in the other. There was a significantly higher incidence of pneumonia among ventilated patients (18.0% vs. 2.7%). Among ventilated patients the pneumonia rate under ranitidine was 28.6% vs. 9.1% in the pirenzepine group (P less than 0.05). The probable cause of the higher pneumonia rate under ranitidine was the gastric colonization with gramnegative organisms. Pirenzepine assures an effective prophylaxis against stress bleeding at least as good as ranitidine. At the same time, the risk of lung infection is also lower with pirenzepine than ranitidine.", 
    "1": "We present a case in which a patient took an overdose of captopril (Capoten) and alprazolam (Xanax) in a suicide attempt. The patient presented with hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg) and drowsiness. The hypotension initially responded to administration of intravenous fluids and dopamine; however, it recurred twice at 18.5 and 24.5 hours after ingestion. These episodes again responded to administration of fluids and dopamine. A plasma captopril level of 27,391.1 nmol/L (5982 ng/mL) was documented, as well as a depressed level of angiotensin converting enzyme. Captopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor used in the management of hypertension and ventricular failure; to our knowledge, this is the first case of an acute captopril overdose reported in the English-language literature. The role of captopril in inducing hypotension is discussed herein.", 
    "2": "Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) has been reported to improve the memory of persons with Alzheimer's disease, but its mechanism of action is uncertain. We found that clinically effective concentrations, 0.03-0.3 microM, readily inhibit acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase from rabbit hippocampal tissue in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 37 degrees C with physiological levels of substrate Above 1 microM, THA was found to act at primary and allosteric sites on M1 and M2 muscarine receptors as an antagonist. This is not clinically important, and low levels of THA do not improve the binding of the agonist, oxotremorine-M. Only 10-1000 microM THA has been shown to block K+ channels. Thus THA probably acts as an esterase inhibitor.", 
    "3": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated Cl- influx was studied in a rat brain 'microsac' preparation. Midazolam (a benzodiazepine), at 0.1-10 microM, increased GABA potency (maximum 2-fold) without affecting its efficacy or exerting GABA-mimetic effect. Pentobarbital (10-500 microM) increased GABA potency (maximum 12-fold) and efficacy (maximum 40%). Pentobarbital exhibited GABA-mimetic effect at concentrations above 200 microM. The differential effects of midazolam and pentobarbital in modulating GABA-mediated responses may account for some of the differences between these two classes of drugs.", 
    "4": "In a study of 2.021 injured persons (accidents at home or at work, road accidents), qualitative assays of serum benzodiazepines by the EMIT method were positive in 9.6 per cent of the cases, including 3.2 per cent who had blood alcohol levels in excess of 0.10 g/l. Benzodiazepines were more frequently found in accidents at home and on roads than in accidents at work. These results raise the question of the role played by benzodiazepines as a possible risk factor of accidents, notably road accidents.", 
    "5": "The feasibility of directly assaying drugs in physiological fluids using on-line preconcentration and microbore high-performance liquid chromatography has been demonstrated. The untreated sample is injected onto a hydrophobic pre-column, using micellar sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the case of serum or phosphate buffer in the case of urine, as the load mobile phase. This traps the components of interest which are then backflushed onto a microbore analytical column using a stronger mobile phase. This procedure was then applied to diazepam in serum and phenobarbital in urine. Recovery was linear and quantitative over the range 30-3000 ng/ml for diazepam in serum and 2-200 micrograms/ml for phenobarbital in urine. The diazepam method was specific against caffeine and the three major metabolites of diazepam: oxazepam, temazepam, and nordiazepam. The effects of varying pre-column dimensions, pre-column loading time, and SDS concentration volume were evaluated.", 
    "6": "The effects of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine flurazepam on motor activity and the turnover of dopamine were measured in rats. Changes in motor activity were measured using a doppler-shift device; changes in extracellular homovanillic acid (HVA), monitored by linear sweep voltammetry with carbon paste electrodes implanted in the striatum and nucleus accumbens and ex vivo measurements of changes in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine (DOPAC/DA) ratios in the striatum and nucleus accumbens were used as indices of changes in the turnover of dopamine. Injection of vehicle increased the nocturnal rise in the concentration of HVA and the ex vivo DOPAC/DA ratio in the nucleus accumbens. Injection of flurazepam decreased the nocturnal rise in HVA and DOPAC/DA ratio in the nucleus accumbens below control levels. There was also a decrease in the nocturnal rise in motor activity. Neither injection of vehicle nor injection of flurazepam caused changes in either the concentration of HVA or the DOPAC/DA ratio in the striatum. The correlation coefficient for motor activity compared to concentration of HVA remained high for the nucleus accumbens but was reduced for the striatum after administration of flurazepam. The results suggest that the sedative effect of flurazepam may be due to an action on the mesolimbic but not the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway.", 
    "7": "Lorazepam 2.5 mg was given as premedication either orally or sublingually to 20 patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. Plasma concentrations were followed for up to 8 h after administration. The time for the maximal plasma concentration (tmax) occurred 40 min after oral administration and 60 min after sublingual administration. No significant differences were found between the two treatments at any time. The plasma concentration after 8 h was high compared to the maximal plasma concentration.", 
    "8": "1. The binding of oxotremorine-M to M1 muscarine receptors was examined by measuring competition between the agonist and 3H-pirenzepine, using rabbit hippocampal membranes suspended in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 1 mM Mn2+. 2. Both ligands interacted with a single class of receptors. The receptors could assume two affinity states for oxotremorine-M, with equal numbers of high-affinity (KH) and low-affinity (KL) sites. 3. KH interconverted reversibly to KL in the absence of divalent cations and interconverted reversibly to a state similar to KL in the presence of guanyl 5'-yl imidodiphosphate. 4. The results are compatible with a model in which a pair of receptor molecules can be stabilized by a guanine nucleotide-binding \"G protein\" and have one site each of KH and KL affinity.", 
    "9": "Successful anaesthetic management of two patients with severe epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica was accomplished with the use of ketamine-diazepam dissociative anaesthesia in one and brachial plexus block in the other. The classification and pathology of epidermolysis bullosa is considered, and the problems associated with anaesthesia in patients with this disease are discussed.", 
    "10": "Thirty drug-resistant epilepsy patients were given 20-30 mg of clobazam in addition to their other anticonvulsants and followed up for 2-3 years in an open-ended study. Fit frequency was markedly reduced in 43% of patients, few side effects occurred and psychological parameters including the Crown-Crisp questionnaire, showed improvement. It therefore seems that clobazam is a useful additional drug added to conventional anticonvulsant regimes.", 
    "11": "We have investigated whether prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors (\"autoreceptors\") exist on cholinergic nerves in human airways in vitro and whether guinea pig trachea provides a good model for further pharmacological characterization of these receptors. Pilocarpine was used as a selective agonist and gallamine as a selective antagonist of these autoreceptors. Acetylcholine (ACh) release from postganglionic cholinergic nerves was elicited by electrical field stimulation (EFS) (40 V, 0.5 ms, 32 Hz). In human bronchi, pilocarpine inhibited the contractile response to EFS in a dose-related fashion; the dose inhibiting 50% of the control contraction was 2.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(-7) (SE) M (n = 22), and the inhibition was 96% at 3 x 10(-5) M. The inhibitory effects of pilocarpine were antagonized by gallamine in a dose-related fashion. The results were qualitatively the same in the guinea pig. Gallamine significantly enhanced the contractile response to EFS in the guinea pig, whereas pirenzepine failed to do so, which suggests that M2-receptors are involved. We conclude that prejunctional muscarinic receptors that inhibit ACh release are present on cholinergic nerves in human airways and that guinea pig trachea is a good model for further pharmacological characterization of these receptors, which appear to belong to the M2-subtype.", 
    "12": "We investigated in vitro the influence of midazolam concentrations ranged between 0.2 and 1.6 microgram/ml on immunological parameters by using the rosette-inhibition-test and the lymphocyte-transformation-test. Additionally, in vivo studies using the lymphocyte-transformation-test and the immunomodulatory activity of serum were performed in young volunteers during experimental determination of hypnotic threshold concentration of midazolam. In vitro, no significant evidence of immunodepression could be demonstrated in a concentration range usually achieved during anaesthesia. In vivo, midazolam concentrations between 0.4-0.8 microgram/ml more likely increased than decreased the reagibility of lymphocytes. This was determined by the lymphocyte-transformation-test, especially for T-lymphocytes stimulated by the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A. Thus, midazolam demonstrates no immunosuppressive effect in concentrations achieved during anaesthesia as could be observed by tests of cellular immune competence. However, one has to take into consideration that only parts of the immunesystem could be examined with these tests.", 
    "13": "Daytime sleep and nocturnal sleepiness were examined in 18 normal sleepers (9 young adults, 9 middle-age adults) for 5.5 days following acute sleep/wake schedule inversion. Triazolam and placebo were compared in a counterbalanced, crossover design. Triazolam improved daytime sleep, but did not produce significant changes in sleep tendency at night. Physiological sleep tendency in the early morning hours (0200 to 0600) was profound, but decreased significantly within 3 to 4 days following sleep/wake inversion, irrespective of treatment condition. Nocturnal performance data generally were consistent with changes in physiological sleep tendency. We conclude that extending daytime sleep by an average of approximately 50 min per day via administration of a hypnotic does not appear to significantly reduce circadian sleep tendency in the early morning hours. Further, considerable adaptation, in terms of sleep tendency, occurred within a weak of simulated night shift despite a relatively constant daytime sleep pattern.", 
    "14": "Sixty-one women undergoing major gynaecological surgery received slow release morphine (MST) 60 mg, with placebo, hyoscine 0.6 mg or diazepam 10 mg, by mouth 2 h before surgery. Plasma morphine concentrations reached a steady level usually within 3 h after administration of MST, and did not increase after surgery unless supplementary opioid was given. Hyoscine delayed morphine absorption. Before operation no fewer than 50% of patients were sedated after MST alone, but this increased to 85% after MST and diazepam. Similarly, only the combination MST and diazepam produced anxiolysis. Postoperative mood was unhappier after MST and hyoscine. Emesis occurred in 40-57% of patients, and was not reduced by hyoscine. Therefore premedication with MST alone did not produce reliable sedation or anxiolysis. A combination of hyoscine and MST premedication cannot be recommended, as it did not produce sedation, anxiolysis or antiemesis and hyoscine may have delayed morphine absorption.", 
    "15": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam were compared in cirrhotic patients (n = 10) and control patients (n = 9), during general anaesthesia. Total plasma clearance was 637 +/- 223 ml min-1 (mean +/- SD) in control patients and 402 +/- 170 ml min-1 in cirrhotic patients (P less than 0.05). The total volume of distribution was similar. Elimination half-life was 135 +/- 40 min in controls and 168 +/- 30 min in cirrhosis (P less than 0.05). Protein binding was evaluated by equilibrium dialysis in both groups at two concentrations of midazolam: 20 and 500 micrograms litre-1. No saturation occurred, but the free fraction was 4.9 +/- 1.7% in cirrhotic patients, compared with 1.9 +/- 0.6% in controls (P less than 0.01). Despite its mainly hepatic elimination, midazolam disposition appears to be only slightly impaired in cirrhotic patients.", 
    "16": "The rapid intracarotid injection technique was used to determine the unidirectional brain uptake of a number of benzodiazepines in the rat. The drugs varied considerably in their lipophilicity and, within the series oxazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, desmethyldiazepam and diazepam, brain extraction of unbound moiety was enhanced as the octanol-water (pH = 7.4) partition coefficient increased. However, with flunitrazepam and midazolam, two fluorine-containing benzodiazepines, extraction was more and less extensive, respectively, than predicted from their lipophilicities. Importantly, the uptake findings were consistent with the characteristic onsets of central effects of the drugs established clinically in humans. The effects of reversible protein binding on uptake also were investigated by the addition of albumin (0-8 g.dl-1) to the injectate. This affected markedly the unbound fraction, determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, and also the brain uptake of all drugs. As the unbound fraction was reduced, the unidirectional brain extraction ratio decreased in a curvilinear fashion toward zero. However, attempts to describe the data were unsuccessful using a conventional model based on transcapillary uptake of only unbound drug whose binding kinetics with albumin were assumed to be the same as those indicated by equilibrium dialysis. The observed brain extraction was greater than predicted, and the discrepancy became more apparent as binding and albumin concentration increased. The data for all of the benzodiazepines could be fitted, however, if the equilibrium association constant was assumed to be smaller in vivo than in vitro, so that the effective unbound fraction in the brain capillaries was substantially higher (5- to 25-fold, dependent on the particular drug) than that estimated in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The objective of this analysis of a linear compartment system is to compute drug input functions that are optimal in producing nontoxic pharmacological responses of maximal therapeutic efficacy. Pharmacokinetics should underlie the rational use of drugs and when a therapeutic range is known, the achievement of safe and effective target concentrations may be assured by a dosage regimen computed for a given administration schedule. The method developed herein is based on linearity and superimposition principles applicable to the class of systems considered. This method requires estimated values of model individual parameters and computes optimum dosage regimens in an iterative scheme, corresponding to a real time dynamical context. An interactive computer program has been developed to perform dosage regimen calculations.", 
    "18": "Heterogeneity in the muscarinic receptor population of guinea pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle was found in competition binding experiments against N-methyl[3H]scopolamine using either a cardioselective (AF-DX 116) or a smooth muscle-selective (hexahydrosiladifenidol) antimuscarinic compound. AF-DX 116 recognized 65% of the total receptors with high affinity and 35% with low affinity. Hexahydrosiladifenidol distinguished 24% of the total receptors with high affinity and 76% with low affinity. The two affinity binding constants displayed in smooth muscle by the compounds were similar to those of heart and glands, suggesting that the muscarinic receptor population in the smooth muscle is formed of about 30% glandular type and 70% cardiac type of the M2 receptors. In dissociation experiments, the rate of breakdown of the N-methyl[3H]scopolamine receptor complex in the smooth muscle was rapid and similar to the dissociation of N-methyl[3H]scopolamine from muscarinic receptors in cardiac membranes, supporting the evidence for the presence of a large fraction of the cardiac receptor type in smooth muscle. To further characterize the population of the smooth muscle receptors recognized as glandular type, we performed protection experiments with hexahydrosiladifenidol, which binds to glandular M3 receptors with high affinity. Smooth muscle membranes were initially incubated with this compound and then phenoxybenzamine was added to irreversibly alkylate the remaining unprotected receptors. Data from competition and dissociation binding experiments showed that, under these conditions, this protected fraction of the total receptor population in ileum smooth muscle had all the characteristics of the glandular type, i.e., slow N-methyl[3H]scopolamine dissociation and affinity constants for a series of selective and nonselective muscarinic antagonists in the same order of magnitude as those found in the glandular tissue. These findings, together with the known observation that hexahydrosiladifenidol is more potent in inhibiting the functional activation of muscarinic receptors in smooth muscle relative to heart, lead to the hypothesis that smooth muscle contractility is mediated by a muscarinic receptor subtype similar to that found in glandular tissue.", 
    "19": "The authors present a case of a 62-year-old woman who was hospitalized with severe medical problems that included congestive heart failure secondary to mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, and a recent history of a right cerebral lacunar infarction. She also had a 2-year history of anxiety and depression, manifested in the hospital by frequent crying spells, sleeplessness, and ruminating about her illnesses. The patient received buspirone 5 mg three times a day for her anxiety and depression. Approximately 12 hours after her first dose, she developed dramatic myoclonus, dystonias, and akathisia. She was given 25 mg of intramuscular diphenhydramine and 1 mg of intramuscular benztropine mesylate, which resulted in little relief; however, 1 mg clonazepam caused both the myoclonic jerks and dystonias to resolve completely.", 
    "20": "A 71-year-old man presented with a continuous generalized tonic-clonic seizure of 80 minutes duration. Multiple attempts to establish an IV line failed. Ten milligrams of midazolam hydrochloride was administered IM and was followed by prompt termination of seizure activity. This report discusses the pharmacokinetic and anticonvulsant properties of midazolam as an alternative to diazepam for the initial treatment of status epilepticus.", 
    "21": "This study determined the anesthetic efficacy of midazolam (MID) in terms of its ability to reduce enflurane MAC (EMAC). Control EMAC was determined by the tail-clamp method in 15 mongrel dogs. Each animal then received at least three incremental infusion rates of MID from among the following: 0.48, 2.4, 9.6, 19.2, 28.8, 48, or 151.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. MAC was determined during each infusion rate following a 1-h observation period, during which time MID concentration in plasma [( MID]) stabilized. [MID] was measured every 15 min beginning 45 min from the start of each new infusion rate. There was a linear relationship between MID infusion rates and the resulting [MID] (r = 0.995). In the range of [MID] from 14 to 14,118 ng/ml, there was a linear relationship between the log [MID] and the percent EMAC reduction. The slope of the line was very shallow, and the [MID] required to reduce EMAC by more than 50% exceeded the [MID] likely to be employed clinically in humans (750 ng/ml). Also, the 73 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) EMAC reduction produced by [MID] = 9,763 +/- 1213 ng/ml was not significantly greater than the 60 +/- 3% EMAC reduction achieved by [MID] = 1,464 +/- 293 ng/ml, a finding which suggests a ceiling effect to the anesthetic efficacy of midazolam. The authors conclude that, within the dose range of MID likely to be employed in humans, MID produced a concentration-dependent reduction of enflurane MAC in the dog. In doses above those likely to be employed clinically, a ceiling effect to the anesthetic efficacy of MID may become evident.", 
    "22": "Cardiopulmonary baroreceptors located primarily on the low-pressure side of the circulation sense slight reductions in cardiac filling pressures and elicit sustained peripheral vasoconstriction. Because most inhalation and many intravenous anesthetics attenuate arterial baroreflex function, the low-pressure baroreflex may serve a major role in maintaining blood pressure during intraoperative hypovolemia. To activate the low-pressure baroreflex, progressive nonhypotensive reductions in central venous pressure were produced with graded applications of lower body negative pressure (LBNP, -5, -10, -15 mm Hg) in 18 ASA class I patients before elective surgery. This produced linear reductions in stroke volume as determined by impedance cardiography and cardiac output. Cardiopulmonary baroreflex-mediated increases in total and forearm vascular resistance assisted in maintaining stable blood pressure. After ten patients were anesthetized with fentanyl (12.5 micrograms/kg) and diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) and an additional eight received these agents plus supplemental N2O (70%), reflex vasoconstrictor responses to LBNP were not attenuated and, therefore, blood pressure continued to be well maintained despite substantial reductions in cardiac filling pressures. Thus, these anesthetic regimens preserved vasoconstrictor responses mediated by cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. This promoted cardiovascular stability that may be particularly beneficial in patients with cerebral, cardiovascular, or renal disease undergoing surgical procedures with potential for rapid blood loss.", 
    "23": "We conducted a placebo-controlled double-blind investigation in 15 normal volunteers to study the time course of amnesia to auditory stimulation produced by lorazepam. We also studied the relationship between auditory amnesia and auditory evoked potentials to determine if long-latency auditory evoked potentials (LLAEPs) could be utilized as electrophysiologic predictors of memory. Amnesia was produced by administration of 0.05 mg/kg lorazepam intravenously. To separate the changes in LLAEPs due to generalized sedation from those associated with amnestic properties of a drug, a third group of subjects given 1.5 mg/kg secobarbital was included. Observed frequency and duration of amnesia to auditory stimulation after lorazepam was 58% and 3 hours, respectively (mean values), with marked diminuition of antirecall effect at 120 minutes. Administration of lorazepam increased the latency and decreased the amplitude of N1 and P3 components of LLAEPs. These changes appeared to be a result of generalized sedation rather than the amnestic properties of the drug. We failed to find a definite relationship between amnesia and changes in LLAEPs. We conclude that P3 component of LLAEPs cannot be utilized as an electrophysiologic predictor of amnesia in humans.", 
    "24": "In order to gain some insight into those structural features that control M1 selectivity, a selected set of pirenzepine analogues has been studied in which both the tricyclic ring system and the basic side chain have been varied. Binding studies were conducted in rat tissue homogenates from cerebral cortex (M1) and gastric fundus (M2). The ratio of IC50 values of the test compounds in the two different tissues was taken as a measure of M1 receptor selectivity. Several derivatives, especially those with flexible side chains, i.e. high degree of freedom of rotation around single bonds, proved to be nonselective. Among semirigid compounds only those containing 6-membered ring systems (11, 13, 14, and 15) showed significant M1 selectivity. Principles of structure-activity and structure-selectivity are discussed.", 
    "25": "The main objective of the present study was to determine whether cholinergic markers (choline acetyltransferase activity and nicotinic and muscarinic receptors) are altered in Alzheimer's disease. Choline acetyltransferase activity in Alzheimer's brains was markedly reduced in various cortical areas, in the hippocampus, and in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The maximal density of nicotinic sites, measured using the novel nicotinic radioligand N-[3H]methylcarbamylcholine, was decreased in cortical areas and hippocampus but not in subcortical regions. M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor sites were assessed using [3H]pirenzepine as a selective ligand; [3H]pirenzepine binding parameters were not altered in most cortical and subcortical structures, although the density of sites was modestly increased in the hippocampus and striatum. Finally, M2-like muscarinic sites were studied using [3H]-acetylcholine, under muscarinic conditions. In contrast to M1 muscarinic sites, the maximal density of M2-like muscarinic sites was markedly reduced in all cortical areas and hippocampus but was not altered in subcortical structures. These findings reveal an apparently selective alteration in the densities of putative nicotinic and muscarinic M2, but not M1, receptor sites in cortical areas and in the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "26": "The affinity for muscarinic ligands of a preparation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors purified from porcine brain was examined by means of competitive binding of [3H]quinuclidinylbenzylate and unlabeled ligands, followed by computer-assisted nonlinear regression analysis. The displacements by antagonists fitted a single-site model. In contrast, the displacements by agonists did not fit the single-site model and could be explained by assuming two populations of binding sites. The proportion of the sites with high affinity for muscarinic agonists (H-sites) ranged from 25 to 35% of the total number of sites. GTP had no effect on the displacements by agonists, a finding indicating that H-sites did not result from interaction between receptors and GTP-binding proteins. In the presence of dithiothreitol, the affinity for muscarinic ligands decreased. The largest effects were observed on the affinity for pirenzepine and that of H-sites for carbachol. Preincubation of the preparation with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) resulted in an increase in the proportion of H-sites to 75% of the total number of binding sites. The results of sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the preparation indicated apparent heterogeneity as to molecular size of the receptors, but this heterogeneity did not correlate with that of the affinity for agonists. In addition, the receptors were detected as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the preparation, regardless of the presence or absence of disulfide-reducing reagents. These results suggest that the redox state of thiol groups in the receptor molecules is relevant to their affinities for ligands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The functional impairment due to spasticity must be carefully assessed before any treatment is considered. Therapeutic intervention is best individualized to a particular patient. Basic principles of treatment to ameliorate spastic hypertonia are: 1) avoid noxious stimuli and 2) provide frequent range of motion. Therapeutic exercise, cold or topical anesthesia may decrease reflex activity for short periods of time in order to facilitate minimal motor function. Casting and splinting techniques are extremely valuable to extend joint range diminished by hypertonicity. Baclofen, diazepam and dantrolene remain the three most commonly used pharmacologic agents in the treatment of spastic hypertonia. Baclofen is generally the drug of choice for spinal cord types of spasticity, while sodium dantrolene is the only agent which acts directly on muscle tissue. Phenytoin with chlorpromazine may be potentially useful if sedation does not limit their use. Tizanidine and ketazolam, not yet available in the United States, may be significant additions to the pharmacologic armamentarium. Intrathecal administration of antispastic medications allows high concentrations of drug near the site of action, which limits side effects. This form of treatment is the most exciting recent development in the treatment of spastic hypertonia. Peripheral electrical stimulation may have limited use in diminishing tone and facilitating paretic muscles. Dorsal column stimulation via electrodes within the spinal column was initially hailed as a therapeutic advance, but has subsequently been shown to be minimally effective. Phenol injections provide a valuable transition between short-term and long-term treatments and offer remediation of hypertonia in selected muscle groups. Tenotomies and tendon transfers offer significant benefit in carefully chosen patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "In order to compare the effects of Diazemuls and midazolam on arterial oxygen saturation during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 120 patients were randomly allocated to receive Diazemuls, midazolam, or normal saline. Endoscopy was performed by one consultant or one of four residents. Arterial oxygen saturation was monitored continuously during endoscopy by means of a Biox III pulse oximeter and ear probe. Oxygen saturation fell during endoscopy in all three groups, but no significant differences between the groups were detected at any stage of the procedure. When all groups were combined, there was significantly less desaturation when the consultant performed the endoscopy, and he was also significantly faster in carrying out endoscopy than the residents in each group. When an inexperienced resident was compared with one with at least 6 months of experience, there were significant differences in degree of desaturation, lowest value during endoscopy and tolerance score. It is suggested that the patient at risk of hypoxemia should, if possible, be endoscoped by an experienced endoscopist.", 
    "29": "The present study was designed to determine the influence of signaled shock on splenic natural killer (NK) activity and nonspecific T-lymphocyte mitogenic responsiveness. Furthermore, experiments were conducted to examine possible mechanisms mediating this suppression. The results demonstrate that a single session of signaled shock induces suppression of splenic NK activity and T-cell response to the mitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). However, the suppression of mitogenic responsiveness was attenuated after five daily sessions of shock, while NK activity remained suppressed. The suppression of NK function was prevented by administration of naltrexone prior to the shock session indicating mediation by opiate receptors. However, naltrexone did not prevent the shock induced suppression of mitogenic responsiveness to Con A or PHA. Diazepam was not effective in preventing the shock-induced suppression of mitogenic responses or NK activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mononuclear cell populations in the spleen are differentially affected by the same stressor and that the immune alterations are mediated via different pathways.", 
    "30": "A reverse-phase liquid chromatographic method is described for simultaneous quantification of quazepam, and two of its metabolites, 2-oxoquazepam and N-desaklyl-2-oxoquazepam. The method uses a solid-phase extraction procedure to prepare plasma samples. After extraction, the methanolic extract is evaporated; the residue is then reconstituted in a small volume of mobile phase and chromatographed. The total chromatography time for a single sample is about 20 min. A sensitivity of 1 ng/ml for quazepam and its metabolites is attained when 1 ml of plasma is extracted. Analytical recovery of quazepam and its metabolites added to plasma ranged from 87 to 96%. The maximum within-day and day-to-day coefficients of variation for each compound at concentrations of 20 and 60 ng/ml were 7.6 and 11.2%, respectively. The method was applied to sublingual pharmacokinetic studies of quazepam in healthy volunteers.", 
    "31": "Myocardial trauma and damage were induced by two doses of isoproterenol 40 mg.kg-1 in rats. Isoproterenol injections alone caused the expected cardiotoxicity. Two doses of alprazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 decreased the severity of electrocardiographic changes after isoproterenol injection and the amount of myocardial tissue damage. The frequency of ischaemic ST-T changes, flat or inverted T waves, Q wave appearance, and heart block was significantly reduced in the alprazolam group. The alprazolam treated group had a significantly smaller proportion of infarcted tissue in the ventricular section (2.3%) and in the apical sections (1.8%) than the vehicle injected rats (6.5% and 14.7% respectively). There was no difference in wet heart weight or in heart rate between the alprazolam group and the control group. These results show that alprazolam has a cardioprotective effect in rats treated with cardiac damaging doses of isoproterenol.", 
    "32": "Midazolam (Mid) is widely used as an anesthetic adjunct. To test its anesthetic effect vs. concentration relationships, it is desirable to establish stable and predictable Mid concentrations in plasma (and brain). Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of Mid in the enflurane-anesthetized dog were determined, and the ability of Mid to reduce the enflurane concentration required for anesthesia was measured and correlated with the Mid concentration in plasma [MID]. Mongrel dogs (n = 9) were anesthetized with enflurane and the enflurane EC50 (MAC--the end-tidal concentration at which one-half of the dogs respond to the noxious stimulation of clamping of the tail, and one-half do not) was determined. Group 1 (n = 5) received Mid 2.5 mg/kg iv over 60 sec. Plasma for determination of [MID] was collected and the enflurane EC50 was determined repeatedly over the 7-8-hr period following injection. Based on the pharmacokinetic parameters determined for Group 1, dogs in Group 2 (n = 4) received Mid as a continuous infusion of 21 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 5 hr accompanied by an initial loading dose (3 mg/kg infused over 20 min) designed to produce a stable [MID] of 1000 ng/ml in plasma. Enflurane MAC and [MID] were determined regularly during the infusion and for 6 hr after discontinuation of the infusion. There were no important differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters determined for Group 1 vs. Group 2: t1/2,z = 98 +/- 5 vs. 95 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SEM); V = 3.94 +/- 0.27 vs. 2.98 +/- 25 L/kg; Cl = 28.5 +/- 3.1 vs. 22.3 +/- 1.1 ml kg-1 min-1, respectively. When administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (Group 2), [MID] remained stable at 949 +/- 53 ng/ml for more than 5 hr. The enflurane EC50 was reduced by 55% and the reduction remained stable during the 5 hours of Mid infusion. After a single iv bolus dose or after discontinuation of the continuous infusion, the degree of enflurane EC50 reduction diminished toward the control (i.e., enflurane alone) value as [MID] declined. Mid-azolam's pharmacokinetics and plasma concentration vs. effect relationships have been determined to be consistent under two different experimental conditions.", 
    "33": "Six peptides (presumably products of natural protein S100 catabolism) were isolated from bovine brain extracts by hydrophobic chromatography, affinity chromatography on immobilized antiprotein S100 antibodies, gel filtration and chromatography on TSK HW-40 columns in a methanol: water system. At 10(-12) M, peptide AT-I-I caused a 70% inhibition of the specific binding activity of endogenous benzodiazepine brain receptors. When used at higher concentrations (10(-9)-10(-5) M), AT-I-I inhibited the binding activity of central serotonin, dopamine and m-cholinoreceptors. Immunochemical analysis revealed the presence of identical material in rat brain glial cell nuclei (astrocytes). Using a solid phase immunoenzymatic assay, it was shown that peptide AT-I-I was not identical to any other of the 14 peptides tested (commercial preparations). Data from immunochemical analysis testified to the species non-specificity of AT-I-I. It was concluded that in brain tissue natural proteolysis of proteins S100 leads to the formation of biologically active oligopeptide products that are involved, in particular, in the modulation of the functional activity of central benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "34": "The effect of a single bedtime dose (7.5 or 15 mg) of 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazol[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) on memory was investigated in young, healthy adults. 2 h after drug intake the subjects were awakened and presented with a series of tasks. Recall was assessed immediately following the task presentation and after awakening in the morning. Immediate recall at night was impaired by the 15 mg dose. A further, dose-dependent decrement of recall from night to morning was observed. In contrast to the immediate deficit, the delayed amnestic effect showed little interindividual variability, was largely independent of the type of task, and was significant even for the 7.5 mg dose. Recall of a list of words learnt before drug intake was not impaired by the lower dose, and was enhanced by the higher dose. The results indicate that two separate processes underlie the immediate and the delayed anterograde amnestic action of benzodiazepines.", 
    "35": "The effects of the selective M1-muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine, were studied on the Morris Water Maze, a test of spatial learning in the rat. Pirenzepine (0, 10 or 30 micrograms) was administered into lateral ventricle during acquisition of this task. Although 30 micrograms of pirenzepine impaired acquisition of the spatial aspects of the task, treated animals still appeared to be able to acquire a taxon strategy. A low dose of pirenzepine (10 micrograms) produced a slight deficit but this was only visible in a \"spatial probe\" trial. Although these results are consistent with the belief that muscarinic M1-receptors are involved in spatial learning, it cannot be excluded that the effects recorded were mediated by muscarinic M2-receptors, due to the low selectivity of pirenzepine.", 
    "36": "The 'hunger-mimetic' model is a prominent explanatory account of benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia. A salient feature of food deprivation (hunger) in laboratory animals is 'finicky' eating, or an enhanced reactivity to the palatability of food. If the hunger-mimetic model is correct, a similar finicky pattern of increased eating should be observed both in hungry (food-deprived) rats and in benzodiazepine-treated, hyperphagic rats. Two groups of rats were matched on measures of ad lib baseline intake of both a highly palatable food (sweetened condensed milk) and a food low in palatability (milk adulterated with 37.5 mg% quinine). Subsequently one group was placed on a moderate food deprivation schedule while the second group was maintained on ad lib food but was injected (IP) with 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide (CDP) 30 min prior to food presentation tests. Single-bottle tests indicated that while the food deprived animals exhibited a greater augmentation of eating when given the high-palatability food, the animals pretreated with CDP exhibited an indiscriminate elevation of eating across both foods. Similarly, on two-bottle choice tests the food-deprived rats exhibited an enhanced preference for the high-palatability food, whereas the CDP-treated animals did not change from baseline food preference. These results fail to support the hunger-mimetic model of benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia. Alternative models based on a perseverative, disinhibitory action of benzodiazepines are discussed.", 
    "37": "This experiment assessed the possibility suggested by previous research that benzodiazepines cause convulsions in infant rats. Seven-day-old Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive either diazepam (DZP) (0, 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg), the convulsogen pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (50 mg/kg), or DZP followed 30 minutes later by PTZ. The amount of paddling and wall progression and head and body tremors was recorded for each group. Both DZP and PTZ elevated paddling and wall progression, but only PTZ elevated head and body tremor scores. DZP antagonized the PTZ-induced increases in head and body tremors. In a second experiment, seven-day-old pups were implanted with cortical electrodes. The following day, baseline electrocorticograms (ECoGs) were taken for each animal. Each pup subsequently received either DZP vehicle, 0.5 mg/kg DZP, 50 mg/kg PTZ, or 0.5 mg/kg DZP followed 30 minutes later by 50 mg/kg PTZ. Neither the vehicle nor the DZP injections altered ECoG activity. In contrast, PTZ-treated pups showed continuous, high-amplitude, spiking activity. Pretreatment with DZP eliminated these PTZ-induced alterations in ECoG activity. We conclude that in infant rats, the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of DZP and PTZ are distinct from one another. Furthermore, both the behavioral and the electrocorticographic effects of PTZ are blocked by DZP. It is unlikely that DZP causes seizures in neonatal rats.", 
    "38": "Four behavioral tests, namely, hypothermia, horizontal dowel, runway and head-dipping, were used to assess tolerance to ethanol and cross-tolerance to chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in mice chronically treated with an ethanol diet for 15 days. Mice were tested on day 3 of ethanol withdrawal, with some being retested on day 8. In terms of hypothermia and the horizontal dowel test, ethanol tolerance conferred full cross-tolerance to CDP, but the conclusion based on results of the latter test may be equivocal. Partial cross-tolerance to CDP was observed in the runway test, while no cross-tolerance to CDP was detected in the head-dipping test. For these latter two tests ethanol tolerance was present in the mice. Thus, the degree of equivalence between tolerance to ethanol and cross-tolerance to CDP in ethanol-dependent mice varied with the behavioral tests to assess tolerance. Possible mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "39": "Nalbuphine and fentanyl were compared as analgesic components of intravenous conscious sedation with diazepam in a double-blind, prospective trial of 50 patients undergoing elective oral surgery. Subjects were evaluated for intensity of pain, pain relief, sedation, anxiety, recall, and vital signs at systematic observation points intraoperatively and postoperatively. At the conclusion of surgery, 88% who received nalbuphine and 87% treated with fentanyl indicated complete pain relief. One observed adverse reaction was attributed to the combination of fentanyl and the sedative component diazepam. No statistically significant differences were observed between nalbuphine and fentanyl treatments.", 
    "40": "We have studied the effects of chlormethiazole and diazepam given orally on the ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) responses to CO2 in a placebo controlled study in 10 healthy volunteers. Diazepam 10 mg produced a significant reduction in both the ventilatory and P0.1 responses to CO2, and this was not associated with any effect on respiratory muscle power. Chlormethiazole 250 mg produced less drowsiness than diazepam 10 mg. Therefore in a subsequent study chlormethiazole 500 mg was compared with placebo. Chlormethiazole in either dose had no effect on CO2 responses or on maximum static respiratory pressures. We conclude that diazepam has a direct depressant effect on chemoreceptors and its effects on indices of ventilatory control are not due to impaired muscle function; chlormethiazole in the doses used has no such effects despite producing drowsiness.", 
    "41": "The discovery of n-butyl beta carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCB) as an endogenous substance of brain capable of interacting with the central benzodiazepine receptor, and the fact that this beta carboline increases in the cerebral cortex of rats undergoing acute stress, led us to study the pharmacological properties of beta CCB in mice. Using 3-mercaptopropionic acid in subconvulsant doses, it was found that this beta carboline, although not being a convulsant, has a proconvulsant action, as indicated by the number of mice undergoing convulsions and the reduction in latency. This proconvulsant effect was observed both with IP or ICV injections and was blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788. In an open-field test the injection of 0.3 mg/kg of diazepam increased the number of squares crossed, while beta CCB had the opposite effect, reducing the squares crossed in a dose dependent manner between 1 and 30 mg/kg. This drug also increased the time of freezing and decreased the number of rearings. These changes were partially counteracted by the injection of 3.6 mg/kg of RO 15-1788. In the plus-maze test, 10 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide increased the number of entries and the time spent in the open arms, while the beta carboline produced the opposite effect. The conclusion reached is that beta CCB has both proconvulsant and anxiogenic actions, behaving as an inverse agonist for the central benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "42": "A randomised, double-blind study of 100 patients admitted for daycase arthroscopy was undertaken. Fifty patients received alfentanil 500 micrograms and midazolam 5 mg, and 50 received alfentanil 500 micrograms alone, in each case 2 minutes before induction of anaesthesia with methohexitone. Anaesthesia was maintained in both groups with nitrous oxide, oxygen and enflurane. Recovery was assessed quantitatively by measuring time to when they awoke and by a comparison of pre- and postoperative performance of p-deletion and postbox tests. Qualitative assessment of recovery and of postoperative pain was also undertaken. Patients completed a questionnaire to record the incidence of any anaesthetic-related symptoms on the first and second postoperative days. Patients who received midazolam required a reduced dose of methohexitone but their initial recovery time was prolonged significantly. The incidences of anaesthetic-related side effects and postoperative pain were similar in the two groups and while the questionnaires did not reveal any statistically significant differences in symptoms on the first 2 postoperative days, the results indicated that patients who received a larger induction dose of methohexitone were subjectively drowsier on the first day after operation.", 
    "43": "Sedation with benzodiazepines in intensive care patients with head injuries has become part of a standard concept in controlling intracranial pressure (ICP) and metabolic demands of an injured brain. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, which is supposed to exert no direct effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in healthy volunteers, suggests that rapid reversal from midazolam sedation might be achieved without any deleterious side effects. It remains however ambiguous if the same holds true in subjects with head trauma. This study describes the effect of flumazenil on CBF, ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) during the reperfusion period after incomplete global ischemia in 10 goats. After preparation progressively decreasing CBF in 7 goats was achieved by stepwise external occlusion of the a. max. interna. 90-120 min after reestablishment of CBF 15 mg midazolam i.v. were given followed by 0.5 mg flumazenil i.v. 5 min later. Within 60 sec after application of the antagonist an increase of CBF by 30-165% and of ICP by 25-310% was noted in 5 goats. Simultaneous changes in arterial pressure, CBF and ICP suggest a severe impact of the benzodiazepine antagonist after midazolam sedation on ICP and CBF during periods of impaired cerebral autoregulation. Until the cerebrovascular and cerebral metabolic effects of flumazenil have been elaborated in detail, it is recommended to titrate the effect of flumazenil over long intervals in head injured patients.", 
    "44": "Alfentanil was administered, together with midazolam, as part of a total i.v. anaesthetic technique. The pharmacokinetics of alfentanil were determined in 10 female patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery. The dose regimen of alfentanil, based on simulation studies, consisted of a two-stage infusion following an initial bolus dose. The kinetics of alfentanil were described by a linear two-compartment open model. The total plasma clearance ranged between 93 and 431 ml min-1 (mean 249 ml min-1). The apparent volume of distribution at steady-state ranged between 0.27 and 0.64 litre kg-1 (mean 0.44 litre kg-1). The apparent volume of distribution (Vd beta) was 0.58 litre kg-1, resulting in a terminal half-life of 112 min. Alfentanil concentrations at the time of extubation and postoperative analgesic requirements were also monitored. Good correlation between respiratory depression and plasma alfentanil concentration was found. Neither lower abdominal surgery nor the simultaneous administration of midazolam seemed to affect the kinetics of alfentanil as compared with results from studies in healthy volunteers. The short half-life of alfentanil, resulting from a small volume of distribution, makes it suitable as part of a total i.v. technique. Consideration must be paid, however, to interindividual differences in the pharmacodynamic response and in plasma clearance.", 
    "45": "Children with seizure disorders frequently are treated with anticonvulsant medications such as clonazepam, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and ethosuximide, which cannot be given parenterally. When the child is unable to take these anticonvulsants orally, he or she may be given parenteral doses of phenobarbital or phenytoin. In many cases, these two medications have failed previously to control seizures, leading to the use of the more recently developed drugs. The use of rectal preparations of some anticonvulsant medications is highly useful and effective when the child is unable to take oral medications because of repeated vomiting, gastrointestinal surgery, and status epilepticus associated with lack of venous access. Rectal use of anticonvulsants has a role in the management of hospitalized seizure patients and can be learned by parents needing to treat their children's seizures at home while awaiting other medical care.", 
    "46": "The present study was designed to evaluate the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the secretory function of cultured chromaffin cells using the method of real-time monitoring. GABA evoked the secretion of catecholamines (CA) from adrenal chromaffin cells in a dose-dependent manner. Bicuculline 10(-5) M inhibited the stimulatory action of GABA. Diazepam 5 X 10(-6) and 2.5 X 10(-5) M facilitated the secretory response evoked by 7 X 10(-5) M GABA by 22% and 96%, respectively, which was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. This finding suggests that GABA-benzodiazepine receptor coupling can function in the secretion of CA from the adrenal chromaffin cells in a manner similar to that observed in the brain. GABA-evoked release of CA was reduced by 1 microM nifedipine to 16% of control, suggesting the involvement of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the mechanisms of the CA-releasing action of GABA in these cells. From these findings, the involvement of GABAergic mechanisms in the regulation of adrenal medullary function can be proposed.", 
    "47": "Two patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type and with intractable seizures in spite of standard anticonvulsant regimens were treated with zonisamide. After zonisamide therapy was initiated, both had a marked decrease in seizure frequency and significant improvement of functioning. Serum zonisamide concentrations were 43 and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, with doses of 8.8 and 10.5 mg/kg/d. Both patients also continue to receive valproic acid and a benzodiazepine.", 
    "48": "In order to study the effect of the new M1-selective antimuscarinic compound telenzepine on physiological esophageal acid exposure, ten healthy volunteers underwent a 24-hour esophageal pH-monitoring during a one week treatment with either tablets containing telenzepine 3 mg nightly or placebo in a double-blind cross-over trial. Side-effects were recorded, and stimulated salivary output was assessed. Using a cut-off pH less than 4, under telenzepine a significant reduction of reflux time and of maximum reflux duration was observed in supine position. Using a cut-off pH less than 2, reflux time was reduced during and after meals, number of refluxes was decreased during meals, and esophageal clearance was improved with telenzepine in supine position. Telenzepine reduced salivary output significantly on day 4 and on day 7. From the results it can be concluded that the drug is not contraindicated in peptic ulcer patients with heartburn. As telenzepine reduces gastroesophageal reflux time during and after meals and in supine position it may be tried as adjuvant treatment in esophageal reflux disease.", 
    "49": "Many advances have been made in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of severe complications of liver disease. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy remains a challenge. Several toxins including ammonia, mercaptans, short-chain fatty acids, benzodiazepine-like substances, GABA-like substances, and impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission are at the top of the list of candidates. Use of the benzodiazepine antagonists is an experimental but promising new therapy in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. In patients with cirrhosis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) remains a common and highly lethal complication. The diagnosis of SBP is based on the polymorphonuclear cell count in the ascites and confirmed by culture of ascitic fluid. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment has reduced mortality of SBP from greater than 90 per cent to 30 to 50 per cent. The appearance of cerebral edema in severe acute hepatocellular failure is associated with high mortality and conventional neurologic signs may be unreliable indicators of brain swelling. Current management of cerebral edema in fulminant hepatocellular failure may include early placement of an extradural sensor for continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure, so that short-term measures can be instituted making later liver transplantation safer. Coagulopathy remains a serious problem in patients with liver disease. Exchange plasmapheresis is a promising short-term adjuvant therapy. However, liver transplantation should be considered the definitive treatment for fulminant hepatocellular failure. The gastroenterologist often encounters multiorgan failure in patients with severe liver disease. Liver transplantation is now an important therapeutic consideration in almost every patient with severe, irreversible liver disease. Efforts should be targeted to early diagnosis of irreversible disease and coordination of patient care with a liver transplant center.", 
    "50": "Psychologic stressors are less potent stimuli of the HPA axis in humans than physical stressors, but they can cause mild changes in acute ACTH and cortisol production. These changes, however, are generally not of sufficient magnitude or duration to cause measurable changes in UFC excretion. Furthermore, chronic stress leads to an attenuation of the HPA axis response. This basic knowledge concerning psychologic stress helps explain the reason why patients with uncomplicated anxiety/panic disorder, a condition involving similar symptoms, do not demonstrate UFC abnormalities. Panic disorder, when accompanied by depression, however, is associated with an increase in UFC excretion which is probably more related to the depression than the panic state. Interestingly, panic disorder, when accompanied by agoraphobia, also shows an elevation in UFC levels which makes it endocrinologically distinct from uncomplicated panic disorder. The reason for this is unclear. Treatment of the panic disorder with benzodiazepines does not further lower the UFC levels in patients with uncomplicated panic disorder despite clinical improvement, but it does lower UFC levels into the normal range in those with concurrent depression and agoraphobia. Alteration in the UFC level with treatment is only partially related to clinical improvement.", 
    "51": "A modified version of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale (CIWA) was used in the management of alcohol withdrawal in a general hospital. Patients who developed seizures or confusion were noted to score higher on the scale, even before these complications, than patients who remained uncomplicated (21.7 +/- 1.2 compared to 15.6 +/- 0.55). When the score was used as a guide for treatment, it was found that patients scoring greater than 15 were at significantly increased risk of severe alcohol withdrawal if they remained untreated (RR, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.85-4.85). The higher the score the greater this relative risk. Some patients however, still suffered complicated withdrawals although their scores were low or they were apparently adequately treated. It is concluded that the use of an objective clinical scale of alcohol withdrawal is valuable in a general hospital to identify those patients in early withdrawal who need sedation to avoid complication. There will however, be a small group of patients whose clinical course will be difficult to predict and further work is needed to determine the reasons for this.", 
    "52": "Food allergy (FA) and food intolerance (FI) are complex syndromes caused by adverse reactions to foods. Since mucosal permeability of the digestive tract is often increased during this pathology, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of two different cytoprotective drugs in patients with urticaria-angioedema due to FA and FI. These drugs were pirenzepine, an anti-muscarinic (anti-MI) receptor antagonist, and rosaprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin. Further, the results obtained by these schedules of treatment were compared with those achieved by the previously described polyantihistaminic treatment (ie, the association of anti-H1 plus anti-H2 receptor blockers). The present investigation suggests that the cytoprotective drugs are more effective than the antisecretive ones (ie, the anti-H2). Recently, anti-H2 drugs and ketotifen were shown to be in vitro inhibitors of the immune response and cromolyn was demonstrated capable of exerting an enhancing effect on T cell proliferation. In the present study we tested the effect of pirenzepine on several immunologic parameters, such as lymphocyte proliferation (through different activation pathways) and lymphokine (interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma) production. Since we found that pirenzepine does not affect the immune response and in consideration of its clinical efficacy, we consider this cytoprotective drug a valuable tool in the treatment of adverse reactions to foods.", 
    "53": "The effects of 2 mg and 4 mg of ethyl loflazepate (CM 6912), a new anxiolytic benzodiazepine, on sleep were studied in 12 healthy male subjects. Polygraphic recordings were made for 6 consecutive nights from each subject. An inert placebo was given on the first 3 nights and on the sixth night, and 2 mg or 4 mg of CM 6912 was administered on the fourth and fifth nights to 6 subjects, respectively. The drug and placebo were administered orally 30 min after supper, and the record of polysomnograms started at 22:30 hr and continued until the natural awakening of the subjects the next morning. The polysomnograms were evaluated by computerized automatic analysis using the method of interval histogram. Both doses of CM 6912 increased total sleep time, and reduced sleep latency and total awakening in a dose-dependent manner. Both doses slightly decreased stage 1 sleep, significantly increased stage 2 sleep, but slightly decreased stages 3, 4 and REM sleep. These changes continued into the sixth recovery night. No obvious changes were observed in subjective assessments after administration of CM 6912. These results suggest that CM 6912 is an efficacious compound and has minimal adverse effects on sleep.", 
    "54": "Six infants with a history of wheezing were given temazepam syrup as sedation, to allow lung function tests to be performed. Despite doses ranging from 2.5 mg/kg-4.5 mg/kg only one infant remained a sleep for 1 h, the time taken for full lung function to be assessed. All other infants awoke within 15 min before test could be completed. Three infants developed hiccoughs and three were very irritable after awaking from sedation.", 
    "55": "Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In general, a total dose of 0.3-0.8 mg will be sufficient in clinical practice, avoiding side effects like nausea, tremor, sweating, or transient anxiety that could be observed when higher dosages were administered. Its therapeutic range is very high as could be demonstrated in experimental animal in which up to 8.000-fold the clinical dose was administered. The total volume of distribution (Vdes) amounts to nearly 1.000 ml/kg BW and the total clearance exceeds 1.200 ml/min, resulting in a biological half-life of less than 60 min. According to the benzodiazepine dosage and the rapid plasma concentration decline of flumazenil, in some cases a resedation could be observed. Hence, a careful observation of the antagonised patient on the ward is mandatory for 1.5-2 h, even if at first sight the antagonization seemed successful and the patient fully awake and cooperative. In anaesthesia, indications to administer flumazenil are adverse drug reactions and prolonged recovery after adequate benzodiazepine dosage. In intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of unknown origin. Additionally, the antagonist may be administered to interrupt benzodiazepine sedation e.g. for neurological examination.", 
    "56": "Since the introduction of diazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam into clinical practice benzodiazepines have been increasingly used for premedication, induction of anesthesia, and long-term sedation in the intensive care unit utilizing their anxiolytic and sedative components. Intraoperative monitoring of central nervous structures has to take into account the effects of benzodiazepines on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked potentials (EP) before their contribution to alterations in brain electrical activity during balanced anesthesia with combination of different drugs can be evaluated. EEG reflects the spontaneous brain electrical activity whereas EP are the averaged time-locked electrical responses to external stimulation. They are thus able to assess the functional integrity of afferent neuronal pathways from peripheral nerves to cortical areas. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil binds competitively to benzodiazepine receptors and is able to induce a change in pharmacodynamic parameters, which i.e. can be measured by EEG- and EP-recordings. Characteristical changes in the EEG after benzodiazepine medication consist in an activation of higher EEG-frequencies simultaneous to a decrease in alpha-activity. A facultative increase in delta-activity seems to be dependent on the absolute dose administered and on the speed for intravenous injection. Benzodiazepine-induced EEG-alterations can be reversed by flumazenil almost completely but in the time course will change again in correspondence to the plasma levels of the benzodiazepines and the half-time of flumazenil. Cortical EP-components are suppressed by benzodiazepines whereas subcortical generated potentials are not altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "Alterations of the immune-system by benzodiazepines are of minor degree in dependence of their central or peripheral activity. Regarding their central effects a modulation may be assumed via the endocrine system. In vitro and in vivo studies lead to the assumption, that benzodiazepines have a mutagenic effect, even though this hypothesis could not be confirmed by in vitro investigations. In vivo a possible mutagenic action could only be found in two patients after long term therapy. A more mitosis-inhibiting effect of diazepam was shown in in vitro studies. In animal experiments this observation could not be confirmed for the thymus. With regard to specific immunity, diazepam seems to have a stimulating effect on the T-helper cells. Locomotion and chemotaxis of human polymorphonuclear granulocytes is not influenced by anaesthetic doses of benzodiazepines. It is questionable whether benzodiazepines are of clinical importance for the immune-system of patients receiving anaesthetic doses. However, the presently generous use of benzodiazepines, e.g. on intensive care units, should be reconsidered in respect to immunological consequences.", 
    "58": "Benzodiazepines are of major interest in anesthesiology and intensive care medicine; they are indicated world-wide pre-, intra- and postoperatively. Application of these drugs is influenced by their side-effects such as hemodynamic changes, limiting their indication. The paper is focusing on general hemodynamic changes caused by benzodiazepines; the most important intravenous derivatives are reviewed with specific reference to their hemodynamic profile.", 
    "59": "Benzodiazepines have an anxiolytic, sedative, amnesic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive action. An analysis of the literature shows that benzodiazepines are the most important substances for premedication. They are preferred the evening before surgery for sleep induction. At the day of surgery they reduce stress better than any other substances or combinations. The different characteristics of different substances are presented. The way of application is discussed. Benzodiazepines, especially midazolam, offer new perspectives in the premedication of small children. Especially this group of patients remains to be a severe anaesthesiological problem.", 
    "60": "Due to the wide margin of safety and their pharmacological properties benzodiazepines are among the most widely used drugs in anaesthesiology and intensive care. Onset, duration and intensity of action depends mainly on their pharmacokinetic characteristics which exhibit some differences between the numerous compounds. All benzodiazepines possess dose-dependently anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive properties. Likewise, the profile of side effects is almost identical, because all central actions of the benzodiazepines are based on a common molecular mechanism. CNS-depressant reactions, such as sedation, (hang-over) fatigue, ataxia, impairment of motor coordination and intellectual functions including memory (amnesia!) are most frequent, especially in the elderly if dosage has not been reduced accordingly. Rapid injection of higher doses should be avoided because these drugs (especially midazolam) can suppress ventilation. However, if benzodiazepines are properly used in patient-adjusted dosage they will represent valuable drugs in anaesthesiology and intensive care.", 
    "61": "Suriclone selectively displaces benzodiazepines from their binding sites but is structurally unrelated to benzodiazepines. Neurologic effects of suriclone were compared to those of diazepam in 54 subjects in a sequential, double-blind, single dose, randomized study (placebo; diazepam 10 mg; suriclone 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, or 0.8 mg). Data were collected on-line by microcomputer. Suriclone 0.2 mg did not differ from placebo. Suriclone 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg did not differ from diazepam 10 mg. Suriclone 0.8 mg caused significantly more decrement than diazepam 10 mg (p less than 0.05) in manual tracking, force platform stability, and Heath rail walking and in total severity of symptoms. Suriclone 0.8 mg caused nausea (p = 0.02), clumsiness (p = 0.02), and loss of balance (p = 0.01) more frequently than diazepam 10 mg. Suriclone 0.8 mg produced symptoms and signs qualitatively and quantitatively different from diazepam 10 mg, such as vomiting, unusual ocular movement effects, and difficulty walking. Possibly the differences in CNS drug binding for anxiolytics are associated with clinical differences in toxicity.",

Representative samples of outpatients treated with tricyclic antidepressants or benzodiazepine anxiolytics were identified in a clinic or pharmacy and interviewed at baseline and specified intervals thereafter in the home or by telephone. Data were collected by lay interviewers trained to use a detailed interview schedule designed with input from experts in pharmacology, relevant clinical disciplines, and survey research. The critical validity question was the degree to which predicted outcomes for the two well-studied drug classes matched observed outcomes. The analytic design involved two contrast groups, three measurement periods, and six key symptom measures. The latter were specific to the disorder (anxiety and depression), to the medications, or to neither the disorders nor the medication (neutral symptoms). Predictions took account of degree and direction of change, as well as differences in profile levels over time. Results conformed precisely to expectations. As one component of a comprehensive system, the method provides an opportunity to examine efficacy as well as safety under conditions that are typically absent or excluded in clinical trials. Data on patterns of prescribing by physicians and use by patients are valuable by-products that are immediately relevant for professional education and product liability. Advantages and limitations of the method are discussed.", 
    "63": "Despite a sharp decline in the prescription of benzodiazepines during the past decade, reservations about their use have continued to escalate. This article presents converging data from three diverse sources: national survey data from consumers, laboratory data on the drug preferences of normal subjects, and a controlled clinical study of long-term diazepam treatment and withdrawal. These data suggest that (1) the risks of overuse, dependence, and addiction with benzodiazepines are low in relation to the massive exposure in our society; (2) benzodiazepine addiction can occur when doses within the clinical range are taken regularly over about 6 months; (3) many patients continue to derive benefit from long-term treatment with benzodiazepines; and (4) attitudes strongly against the use of these drugs may be depriving many anxious patients of appropriate treatment.", 
    "64": "The authors critically review 20 reports (studies and large case series) detailing the nature, severity, and variability of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes. Factors affecting the frequency and intensity of withdrawal are identified, and methodologic problems limiting the generalizability of certain findings are pointed out. Treatment approaches for minimizing withdrawal are reviewed, and implications for the problem of long-term benzodiazepine use and dependence are discussed.", 
    "65": "Several series of heterocyclic carboxylic esters were found to be active in the benzodiazepine receptor binding assay, a typical example being ethyl 7-ethyl-5-methoxyimidazo[1,2-a]quinoline-2-carboxylate (4b) with an IC50 of 150 nM. The corresponding phenylmethanone 5d was more potent with an IC50 of 14 nM and was orally active in animal models thought to predict anxiolytic effects. The synthesis of a large number of compounds resulted in the optimization of this activity in a series of (imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)phenylmethanones of which compounds 7e, 8b, 8h, 8j, and 8k were equipotent with chlordiazepoxide while exhibiting reduced anticonvulsant activity, little or no muscle relaxation, and negligible sedative effects.", 
    "66": "The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of acute confusional state (ACS), its predisposing factors and consequences in 111 consecutive patients operated for fractured neck of the femur. The incidence of ACS was 61 percent and the predicting factors were old age and dementia. Drugs with anticholinergic effect, depression, and previous stroke were factors that seemed to be associated with the development of ACS. Ninety-two percent of the patients who had severe perioperative blood pressure drops developed ACS. The consequences of ACS were prolonged ward-stay at the orthopedic department, a greater need for long-term care after discharge, and poor walking ability at discharge and six months after surgery. The confused patients also had more complications, such as urinary problems, feeding problems and decubital ulcers, as compared with the nonconfused patients.", 
    "67": "Seven patients with schizophrenia and panic attacks all showed marked improvement of positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms when alprazolam was openly added to antipsychotic medication. Panic attacks may identify alprazolam-responsive schizophrenic patients and may define a distinct pathophysiologic subgroup.", 
    "68": "The management of agitated behavior in the elderly represents one of the major challenges in geriatric medicine. Inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity often results in problem behavior that burdens caregivers or nursing home staff. A careful differential diagnostic approach to agitated behavior is imperative to avoid misdiagnosis. The misuse of psychoactive drugs often begins with an unclear idea of the underlying pathophysiology. Treatment should be combined with an explicit establishment of therapeutic goals and a precise understanding of the pharmacological profiles of commonly used drugs.", 
    "69": "In an elevated plus-maze model of anxiety mice treated with the benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM (0.5-1.5 mg/kg i.p.) spent significantly less time on the open arms and showed the decreased number of open arm entries. The opposite i.e. increased time spent on the open arms and the higher number of open arm entries was registered after diazepam (1.5 mg/kg). The results are consistent with the results obtained in the other animal tests and support the idea that this procedure is suitable for detecting anxiolytic/anxiogenic effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands. After testing of 84 mice in an elevated plus-maze substantial differences were detected between the individuals. According to the behavioral response two subgroups of animals with DMCM or diazepam like exploratory activity (as compared to the whole group data) termed as \"anxious\" or \"non-anxious\", respectively, were chosen for further binding studies. \"Anxious\" animals had significantly lower numbers of 3H-flunitrazepam and 3H-muscimol binding sites as compared to \"non-anxious\" animals in cerebral cortex but not in cerebellum. No differences in the affinity were found between the two groups studied. The results indicate that behavioral anxiety in mice is in correlation with the decreased number of GABA and benzodiazepine receptors in cerebral cortex.", 
    "70": "Effect of etizolam on platelet activating factor (PAF) and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-induced superoxide anion (O2-) production in guinea pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) was investigated. Etizolam showed the inhibitory effect on PAF-induced O2- production concentration dependently, with an IC50 value of 4.7 microM, but it had no inhibitory effect on FMLP-induced O2- production at 100 microM. These results suggest that etizolam has a selectively strong inhibitory effect on PAF-induced O2- production in guinea pig PMNL.", 
    "71": "The triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam appears to have a unique clinical spectrum, and recent studies indicate unusual binding properties at the benzodiazepine receptor when assessed in vivo at low doses (0.02-0.05 mg/kg). To assess the behavioral activity of alprazolam at low doses, we examined open-field activity after one hour in mice treated with alprazolam, triazolam, and clonazepam. Following triazolam and clonazepam administration, open-field activity decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, low doses of alprazolam resulted in an increase in open-field activity, whereas higher doses decreased activity. For all three drugs, activity was linearly related to receptor binding. Pretreatment with a dose of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 sufficient to fully occupy receptors had no effect on open-field activity, but when administered concurrently with alprazolam (0.05 mg/kg) prevented the increase in activity seen with alprazolam alone. Increased open-field motor activity represents a behavioral correlate to the increases in receptor binding seen with low-doses of alprazolam. Changes in activity appear to be mediated at the benzodiazepine receptor, since an antagonist prevents increased activity. These data suggest that the unique clinical effects of alprazolam may be due in part to unusual interactions with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "72": "The behavioral and biochemical effects of ethanol in man and animals have been investigated for a long time. A role of catecholamines in the central stimulatory action and during withdrawal has been envisaged, but more recent observations have revealed the involvement of inhibitory synaptic transmitter, GABA, in the actions of ethanol. Ethanol-induced motor incoordination, hypnosedation, antianxiety, and anticonvulsant actions are reported to be GABA-mediated. Involvement of the GABA system has been implicated in ethanol withdrawal-induced seizures in animals. More direct evidences using Cl- influx studies in synaptoneurosomes and spinal neuronal culture studies confirm such a mode of action of ethanol, probably influencing the chloride channel modulation at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex. RO15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-Oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5-alpha], [1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate), a novel imidazobenzodiazepine, an analogue of the classical benzodiazepine antagonist is reported to possess alcohol antagonistic properties. RO15-4513 reverses both the behavioral and biochemical effects of ethanol, including the action of GABA-induced Cl- fluxes. But its potential clinical application may be restricted due to its inverse agonistic property. The present review focuses on the GABA-linked behavioral and biochemical actions of ethanol and discusses the potential of RO15-4513 as an alcohol antagonist.", 
    "73": "Following chronic administration (10 or 20 days) of diazepam (5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous pellets) or RO 15-1788 (5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), adenosine and benzodiazepine receptors in different rat brain areas were assessed by radioligand binding studies using [3H]R-PIA for A1 receptors, [3H]NECA and [3H]R-PIA for A2 receptors and [3H]FNZ for benzodiazepine receptors. Chronic administration of diazepam for 10, but not for 20 days, decreased A2 receptors in the striatum by 46% (p less than 0.05) and A1 receptors in the hippocampus by 13% (p less than 0.05). Administration of diazepam for 10 days and 20 days failed to alter [3H]FNZ binding in all brain areas studied. However, 20 days of diazepam administration decreased the magnitude of GABA enhancement of [3H]FNZ binding in the cortex by 25% (p less than 0.05). In contrast, chronic administration of RO 15-1788 failed to alter [3H]R-PIA, [3H]NECA and [3H]FNZ binding in all brain areas. These results suggest that adenosine receptors may play a role in the CNS actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "74": "Receptor autoradiography was used to localize and quantify the distribution of benzodiazepine receptor sites in human post mortem materials using [3H]flunitrazepam. The distribution and density of these sites was analysed in the brains of 21 patients dying without reported neurological disease. The distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain was found to be comparable from case to case although differences in the density occurred among the brains examined. No influence of the post mortem delay, age, gender or pre mortem drug treatment on the distribution and densities was observed in our series. The highest densities of benzodiazepine receptors in human brain were localized in cortical and hippocampal areas, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and mammillary bodies. Intermediate densities were found in the basal ganglia and thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding was low in the brainstem nuclei and very low in white matter. The triazolopyridazine Cl 218872, reported to differentiate between type I and type II benzodiazepine receptor sites, exhibited regional differences in affinity when used to block [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebellar cortex were more sensitive to this compound than those in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus. An enrichment in the concentration of type I benzodiazepine receptor Cl 218872-sensitive sites was observed in motor areas as compared to structures of the limbic system. The addition of GABA to the incubation medium resulted in an increase of [3H]flunitrazepam binding, suggesting the coupling of these sites to a GABAA receptor. The increase in binding was directly proportional to the density of benzodiazepine receptors but unrelated to the density of high-affinity GABAA sites. The distribution of benzodiazepine receptor sites in the human brain compares well with that previously described in the rat brain. The high densities of receptors localized in the limbic system and in the cortical areas suggest that the effects of benzodiazepines are mediated through an interaction with the sites we have visualized in these anatomical structures. Our results provide a detailed map of the distribution of benzodiazepine receptors and a basis for the understanding of pharmacological effects of these drugs in humans and for future studies of modifications of these receptors in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in humans."
