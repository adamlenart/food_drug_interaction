    "4": "It is well known that the myoglobinuric acute renal failure caused by drugs is an important clinical aspect of nephrology. On the other hand, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially fatal, idiosyncratic reaction to neuroleptics and is characterized by muscular rigidity, fever, autonomic dysfunction and altered consciousness. The most common serious complication of malignant syndrome is rhabdomyolysis. We investigated 10 cases with acute renal failure induced by haloperidol and other neuroleptics. At the time they developed acute renal failure, the patients were taking a wide variety of medications. However, seven of the patients who developed acute renal failure, had received haloperidol, phenothiazine and anticholinaergic drugs, and 2 cases with acute renal failure were taking lithium. Characteristic clinical manifestations of malignant syndrome were observed in 7 patients who had been administered haloperidol orally or intravenously. All of the patients with acute renal failure induced by haloperidol, lithium and other neuroleptics were treated successfully with blood purification therapy (HD or HDF). We concluded that acute renal failure associated with malignant syndrome evoked by haloperidol is an indication for blood purification therapy.", 
    "5": "Two types of benzodiazepine dependence have been described: high vs. therapeutic dose dependence. So far, no systematic research has been conducted regarding the frequency with which the various benzodiazepines are represented in one type or the other. In this study, 153 dependent patients using 14 different benzodiazepines were evaluated to assess the prevalence of their use among high vs. therapeutic dose dependents. Triazolam was the single drug most frequently used by high-dose dependents, followed by Lorazepam. No significant differences were found among benzodiazepines regarding their use by therapeutic dose dependents. Our data shows that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors appear to be related to the frequency with which the different benzodiazepines are used by high and therapeutic dose dependents.", 
    "6": "The effect of tizanidine given as a premedication on perioperative hemodynamics (mean blood pressure, heart rate), sedation, hypnosis and midazolam requirements for induction were assessed in 68 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were assigned to three groups. Group 1 was premedicated 90 min prior to induction with tizanidine 4 mg po (n = 28); group 2 was premedicated with tizanidine 2 mg po (n = 12); group 3 received no premedication (n = 28). In group 1, increase of mean blood pressure on anesthesia induction was attenuated significantly and sedative and hypnotic effects were stronger significantly compared with other groups. We also found that the amounts of midazolam necessary for loss of consciousness were significantly less in patients who had received tizanidine 4 mg. In conclusion, tizanidine is a useful drug as preanesthetic medication for general anesthesia.",

The childrens' behaviour began to change 3-5 min after the intranasal administration of midazolam. The sedation lasted 2 h and the full co-operation of the patient was assured. The difference between the initial and post-midazolam evaluation of maximal cystometric capacity, contractility, compliance, intravesical pressure, maximum flow rate, intravesical pressure at maximum flow and the amount of residual urine were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). Electromyographic characteristics showed no significant change with the use of midazolam (P > 0.05).",

    "11": "This study was designed to determine the effect of a potent cholecystokinin antagonist, L-364,718, on canine pancreatic endocrine function following partial pancreatectomy. Plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon were determined over a 2-hr interval following an intravenous bolus of 0.5 g/kg glucose in a 50% solution. The following groups were established: normal animals (group A, n = 5), normal animals pretreated with 20 nmole/kg L-364,178 (group B, n = 5), partially pancreatectomized animals (group C, n = 5), and partially pancreatectomized animals pretreated with 20 nmole/kg L-364,178 (group D, n = 5). In contrast to animals with an intact pancreas, pretreatment with L-364,718 following partial pancreatectomy resulted in a significant decrease in peak insulin (group C = 132.8 +/- 13.0 microU/ml vs Group D = 90.4 +/- 16.1 microU/ml, P < 0.05) and the basal-to-peak insulin difference (group C = 111.9 +/- 11.5 microU/ml vs group D = 77.5 +/- 16.6 microU/ml, P < 0.05). Despite this, the rate of glucose utilization (K value) was significantly increased in the partially pancreatectomized animals given the antagonist (group C = -1.22 +/- 0.22%/min vs group D = -2.79 +/- 0.427%/min) and there were no significant differences in basal or peak glucose when comparing the groups given L-364,718 with the groups given placebo (group A vs B and group C vs D). Thus, the CCK antagonist L-364,718 significantly decreases peak insulin in partially pancreatectomized animals but not in nonoperative control animals. There is a paradoxical increase in the rate of glucose utilization but no effect on glucose homeostasis. The effect of this antagonist in other models of reduced islet cell reserve (i.e., pancreas transplantation) remains to be determined.", 
    "12": "Patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin may experience behavioural disorders like depressive, anxiety-related or schizophrenic-like symptoms between seizures, i.e. interictally. The neural mechanisms underlying these enduring interictal disorders remain to be investigated. The aim of the present study was to examine the behavioural consequences of kindling of the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, an animal model of limbic complex partial seizures. Animals having experienced 15 stage 5 seizures were compared to non-kindled controls in different behavioural tests performed at least seven days after the last seizure. Kindled animals showed a significant reduction of exploration of open arms in the elevated plus-maze test. In the social interactions test, they showed a decrease of non-social behaviour and an increase of immobility. No modifications were observed in kindled animals when tested in the open field, the sucrose preference or the forced swimming test. The reduction of open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze was reversed by a pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide (2 mg/kg i.p.), a benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Finally, a similar reduction of open arm exploration was observed when animals were kindled only until a stage 3 seizure occurred. These data, along with previous studies, suggest that kindling of the amygdala has anxiogenic consequences and provide an animal model to study the neuroplasticity phenomena underlying enduring interictal disorders in humans.", 
    "13": "Thyroid hormones, which are known to act by genomic mechanisms in peripheral tissues, were found to influence the binding and function of the GABAA receptor complex in brain membranes. Submicromolar concentrations of triiodothyronine and thyroxine stereospecifically stimulated the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (a convulsant ligand for the GABAA receptor complex) to highly washed rat brain membranes, while higher concentrations of the hormones inhibited radioligand binding. GABA-stimulated 36Cl-flux in isolated brain membrane sacs was inhibited by L-triiodothyronine with a half-maximally inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10(-7) M. Patch-clamp analysis of recombinant GABAA receptor subunits expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells showed an inhibition of chloride currents by thyroid hormones. This effect required only the alpha 1 beta 2 subunits, and was not blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Since thyroid hormones are known to be concentrated in nerve terminal preparations and subsequently released, the hormones may have non-genomic mechanisms of action as putative neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in brain and act through GABAA receptors.", 
    "14": "Studies of molecular cloning predict great heterogeneity for the GABAA receptor; however, evidence for functionally and pharmacologically distinct native GABAA receptors is relatively scarce. In this work we have compared some of the functional and pharmacological properties of two GABAA receptors previously shown to be present in the adult rat central nervous system. In superfused hippocampal synaptosomes activation of GABAA receptors increased the basal release of [3H]noradrenaline (EC50 for GABA = 3.2 microM). In contrast, the overflow evoked by depolarization with high-K+ (12 or 35 mM) was not affected. Conversely, GABAA receptor activation led to potentiation of the K(+)-evoked overflow of [3H]D-aspartate from cerebellar synaptosomes (EC50 for GABA = 1.3 microM) whereas the basal release remained unchanged. GABA and muscimol also potentiated the K(+)-evoked overflow of endogenous glutamate in cerebellum. Diazepam enhanced the GABA (3 microM)-evoked [3H]noradrenaline release (EC50 = 65 nM). The diazepam potentiation of the GABA- or muscimol-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline was inversely related to the agonist concentration. The effect of diazepam was reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Zolpidem mimicked diazepam (EC50 = 14 nM). The increase of the K(+)-evoked overflow of [3H]D-aspartate (or of endogenous glutamate) elicited by GABA or muscimol in cerebellar synaptosomes was not affected by benzodiazepines (diazepam or clonazepam) or by zolpidem. On the other hand, Ro 15-4513, an inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine site, strongly inhibited (EC50 = 7 nM) the enhancement by GABA (3 microM) of the K(+)-evoked [3H]D-aspartate overflow in cerebellar synaptosomes; the effect of Ro 15-4513 was reversed by flumazenil. These results suggest the existence in the central nervous system of the adult rat of two native pharmacological-subtypes of the GABAA receptor having different function, regional distribution and neuronal location; the receptors require different membrane potential to be activated and display different sensitivity to benzodiazepines and to drugs acting at benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "15": "Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders in the United States. In the past 3 decades, substantial advances have been made in the ability to identify and treat anxiety disorders including panic disorder (PD), social phobia (SP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is now known that these common, usually chronic disorders confer significant disability to untreated sufferers. This overview highlights some of the important advances in pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders. Evidence for efficacy of the various pharmacological agents (including relevant oral dosing and plasma-level data) and of acute and long-term treatment, and the disadvantages of medication treatment are discussed. Finally, some important clinical questions remaining to be addressed by psychopharmacological research are reviewed.", 
    "16": "Myocardial ischaemia and infarction has become a well-recognized sequelae of cocaine use. The possibility of recent cocaine use should be assessed in patients with potential myocardial ischaemia because the treatment of patients with myocardial ischaemia related to cocaine differs from that of patients with myocardial ischaemia unrelated to cocaine. Patients with cocaine-associated myocardial ischaemia should receive initial treatment with benzodiazepines to decrease central adrenergic stimulation. Aspirin should be used to reduce thrombus formation, and nitroglycerin to reverse coronary vasoconstriction. Patients with continued ischaemia can be treated with either low doses of phentolamine, or verapamil. If ischaemia continues after treatment with these agents mechanical reperfusion or thrombolytic therapy should be considered depending upon the clinical circumstances. Patients with myocardial ischaemia secondary to cocaine should not receive treatment with beta adrenergic antagonists as these agents enhance coronary vasoconstriction thereby worsening ischaemia.", 
    "17": "We have studied the effect of alfentanil and midazolam+alfentanil on the conditions for laryngeal mask airway insertion in patients receiving propofol for induction of anaesthesia. Ninety unpremedicated. ASA 1 or 2 adult patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups: group P received propofol only (2.5 mg.kg-1); group PA received alfentanil (10 micrograms.kg-1) followed by propofol (1.25 mg.kg-1); group PMA received midazolam (0.04 mg.kg-1) and alfentanil (10 micrograms.kg-1) followed by propofol (1.25 mg.kg-1). Further boluses of propofol (0.25 mg.kg-1 every 15 s) were given if the initial dose was inadequate for induction of anaesthesia. Patients in the midazolam+alfentanil group required less propofol (p < 0.001), had better mouth opening (p < 0.001) and fewer undesired responses to laryngeal mask airway insertion (p < 0.001) than the other two groups.", 
    "18": "Previous imaging studies using 11C-flumazenil in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortical partial seizure disorders have found focal decreases in gamma-aminobutyric acid type A/benzodiazepine receptor binding. These studies used subjective visual assessment and a region of interest approach to quantitation. We performed three-dimensional, 11C-flumazenil positron emission tomography in 12 patients with cortical dysgenesis identified by high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and in 26 normal subjects. Spectral analysis was used to produce a parametric image of 11C-flumazenil volume of distribution for each subject. Using volumetric normalization and statistical parametric mapping, we compared the entire brain volume of each patient with the brains of the normal group to produce maps of regions of abnormal 11C-flumazenil binding which were then rendered into the volumetric magnetic resonance images. This allowed a correlation of structure and function to be made. Of the 12 patients, 10 showed at least one region of abnormal 11C-flumazenil binding; the abnormal regions were frequently more extensive than were the lesions seen with magnetic resonance imaging. 11C-Flumazenil binding abnormalities were frequently seen in regions of cortex that had a normal magnetic resonance appearance. Lesions were characterized by increases in gamma-aminobutyric acid type A/benzodiazepine receptor availability, and by the decreases found in previous studies. These findings have implications for the neurobiology of seizure disorders associated with cortical dysgenesis and for the management of such patients if surgery is contemplated.", 
    "19": "Positron emission tomography was used with [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose to study GABA type A/benzodiazepine (GA-BA-A/BDZ) receptors and cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (1CMRg1c) in 17 male patients with severe chronic alcoholism (ALC), 8 with (ACD) and 9 without alcoholic cerebellar degeneration (non-ACD). In comparison with male normal controls of similar ages, the ALC group had significantly reduced FMZ ligand influx (K1), FMZ distribution volume (DV), and 1CMRg1c bilaterally in the medial frontal lobes, including superior frontal gyrus and rostral cingulate gyrus; the ACD group had significant reductions of K1, DV, and 1CMRg1c bilaterally in the same distribution, and also in the superior cerebellar vermis; and the non-ACD group had significant reductions of K1, DV, and 1CMRg1c bilaterally in the same regions of the frontal lobes but not in the superior cerebellar vermis. When compared with the non-ACD group, the ACD group had significant reductions of K1, and DV bilaterally in the superior cerebellar vermis. The results suggest that severe chronic alcoholism damages neurons containing GA-BA-A/BDZ receptors in the superior medial aspects of the frontal lobes, and in patients with clinical signs of ACD, neurons containing GABA-A/BDZ receptors in the superior cerebellar vermis.", 
    "20": "Controversy still exists regarding the role of cholinergic pathways in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in man. We studied the effects of the administration of placebo, pyridostigmine (PD); 120 mg, orally), and the combination of PD and pirenzepine (PZP; 100 mg, orally) on ACTH, cortisol, and GH secretion at 0730 and 2230 h in seven normal males. PD induced a clear decrease in ACTH levels at both times of the day compared to treatment with placebo, producing higher suppression in the nocturnal period (34.4 +/- 5.8% vs. 21.8 +/- 10.7%). The combination PD and PZP prevented the inhibitory action of PD on ACTH secretion in the morning, but not in the evening, when ACTH values showed a decrease similar to that seen after giving PD alone (38.1 +/- 5.6% vs. 34.4 +/- 5.8%, respectively). Cortisol values declined only when the association PD plus PZP was given in the evening. GH levels had a significant increase after PD administration in the morning (4.1 +/- 1.2 ng/mL) and in the evening (10.2 +/- 1.6 ng/mL), confirming that cholinergic stimulation was taking place, whereas the addition of PZP to PD induced a significant attenuation of these responses. It is concluded that cholinergic pathways have a inhibitory role in ACTH secretion in man. M1 muscarinic receptors seem to be involved in the diurnal inhibition of PD, whereas our observations are consistent with the mediation of another type of cholinergic receptors as an explanation for the nocturnal effect of PD on ACTH secretion. PD did not alter the circadian variation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, whereas the association of PD and PZP increased the differences between diurnal and nocturnal ACTH values, suggesting a modulatory effect of the cholinergic system on the circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion.", 
    "21": "Behavioral effects of MKC-242 (5-{3-[((2>)-1,4-benzodioxan-2-ylmethyl)amino] propoxy}-1,3-benzodioxole CHl), a novel and selective serotonin 1A receptor agonist, were investigated in rats and mice and compared against those of diazepam, buspirone and tandospirone. MKC-242 (0.0625-0.25 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly increased punished drinking in water-deprived rats. The reference compounds also increased punished drinking at doses of 10 to 40 mg/kg, p.o. The increase by MKC-242 was blocked by N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxypenyl)piperazin-1-yl) -2-phenylpropanamide, a serotonin 1A receptor antagonist. MKC-242 (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) also increased social interaction under high light and unfamiliar conditions in rats. It had weak benzodiazepine-like side effects in mice. MKC-242 (1, 3 mg/kg, p.o.) attenuated the reduction of locomotion caused by restraint stress in rats, the same effects were observed on both buspirone (100 mg/kg, p.o.) and tandospirone (100 mg/kg, p.o.). In the forced swimming test in rats, MKC-242 (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.), 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (1, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) and amitriptyline (30 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced immobility, although diazepam, buspirone and tandospirone did not. The reduction by MKC-242 and 8-OH-DPAT was antagonized by N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl) -2-phenylpropanamide. Moreover, the reduction was also blocked by 1-(2--pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), a common metabolite of buspirone and tandospirone. These findings suggest that MKC-242 possesses potent anxiolytic and antidepressant properties that are mediated via an activation of serotonin 1A receptors.", 
    "22": "The anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol and neuroactive steroids are mediated by selective interactions with gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) receptors. Chronic ethanol exposure decreases the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to benzodiazepines, barbiturates and ethanol. Ethanol withdrawing rats are cross-tolerant to the anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines as shown by a 16% decrease in the anticonvulsant efficacy of diazepam compared to controls. In contrast, ethanol withdrawing rats are sensitized to the anticonvulsant effects of the neuroactive steroid 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP), exhibiting a 46% increase in the anticonvulsant effect against bicuculline-induced seizures compared to control rats. This effect may involve a change in the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP because potentiation of GABA(A) receptor mediated chloride uptake into cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes is enhanced by 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP up to 50% in ethanol withdrawing rats compared to controls. 3 alpha,21-dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (THDOC) potentiation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated chloride uptake is also enhanced during ethanol withdrawal. Moreover, the plasma levels of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP and progesterone did not differ in ethanol withdrawing rats compared to controls. These alterations in neurosteroid sensitivity were also accompanied by selective alterations in cortical GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA levels. Levels for the alpha 1 and alpha 4 subunit showed only slight alteration during withdrawal whereas we had previously observed a significant decrease in alpha 1 and a significant increase in alpha 4 mRNA levels in ethanol dependent (not withdrawing) animals. beta 2, beta and gamma 1 mRNA levels significantly increased during ethanol withdrawal. Taken together, these results suggest that ethanol withdrawal produces alterations in GABA(A) receptors that sensitize rats to the pharmacological effects of neuroactive steroids. Because ethanol-dependent or withdrawing rats are tolerant to the intoxicating, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of ethanol and cross-tolerant to many effects of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, sensitization to the effects of neuroactive steroids could have significant therapeutic potential.",

Participants were randomly divided into two groups-propofol-treated and methohexital-treated. All anesthetic agents were titrated in bolus using dosages standardized by weight. After premedication with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl, general anesthesia was induced either by propofol or methohexital. The quality of the anesthesia was subjectively evaluated by the anesthetist, surgeon, and the patient. Also, a standardized battery of tests was developed to quantitatively evaluate recovery from anesthesia.",

However, at the same time, propofol showed significantly greater percentage lowering of diastolic blood pressure. The mean low heart rate percentage of preoperative baseline were different, but both were greater than 100%. The anesthetist and patient evaluations showed no statistically significant difference in the acceptance of either agent. No patient in either group had any recollection of pain with induction or any recollection of the operation itself. There were no statistically significant effects of group in recovery test performance, although patients tended to recover more quickly in the symbol digit test and object recall test with propofol.

However, the drug's mechanisms of antiepileptic actions are still undetermined. The purpose of this study was to learn how clobazam and its active metabolite modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated currents in rat cerebral neurons in culture.", 
    "32": "Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed on cultured cerebral neurons of the rat. Clobazam or its metabolite N-desmethylclobazam was dissolved in the extracellular solution and applied for 2 s by pressure ejection from a micropipette. To maintain GABA-activated currents, 2 mM Mg adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was added to the intracellular solution.", 
    "33": "GABA elicited outward currents that were mediated by GABAA receptor-coupled Cl- channels. Applying clobazam with 10 microM GABA elicited enhanced outward currents. Flumazenil, an antagonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, inhibited the enhancing effect of clobazam. The enhancement ratio increased as much as 2.28-fold in a dose-dependent manner at a concentration of 3 microM clobazam. However, it started to decrease at a concentration of 10 microM clobazam. The metabolite N-desmethylclobazam was tested in the same manner, and exhibited an identical dose-dependent enhancement of GABA-activated currents.", 
    "34": "The antiepileptic effects of the 1,5-benzodiazepines are attributed to the enhancement of GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. The antiepileptic effects of clobazam are thought to depend mainly on its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam, which is present in high concentrations in patients who receive long-term clobazam. Clobazam's enhancement of GABA-activated currents was most marked on weaker GABA currents. We therefore infer that clobazam acts more efficiently on tissues in which the release of GABA is diminished.", 
    "35": "Acute fulminant hepatic necrosis was associated with repeated oral administration of diazepam (1.25 to 2 mg, PO, q 24 or 12 h), prescribed for behavioral modification or to facilitate urination. Five of 11 cats became lethargic, atactic, and anorectic within 96 hours of initial treatment. All cats became jaundiced during the first 11 days of illness. Serum biochemical analysis revealed profoundly high alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities. Results of coagulation tests in 3 cats revealed marked abnormalities. Ten cats died or were euthanatized within 15 days of initial drug administration, and only 1 cat survived. Histologic evaluation of hepatic tissue specimens from each cat revealed florid centrilobular hepatic necrosis, profound biliary ductule proliferation and hyperplasia, and suppurative intraductal inflammation. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicosis was suspected because of the rarity of this condition. Prior sensitization to diazepam was possible in only 1 cat, and consistent risk factors that could explain susceptibility to drug toxicosis were not identified. On the basis of the presumption that diazepam was hepatotoxic in these cats, an increase in serum transaminase activity within 5 days of treatment initiation indicates a need to suspend drug administration and to provide supportive care.",

The disorder occurs most frequently in the young and the old extremes of the population. GCSE commonly occurs in patients with no history of seizures or epilepsy. The morbidity associated with status epilepticus is related to the underlying precipitating factors, age of the patient, and duration of seizure activity. Morbidity and mortality are highest in elderly patients and those with acute symptomatic seizures--for example, GCSE related to anoxia or cerebral infarction. Mortality is lowest among pediatric patients and patients with unprovoked seizures or GCSE related to low antiepileptic drug levels. Intravenously administered diazepam or lorazepam and phenytoin remain the first-line therapy for GCSE. More than half the patients will respond to initial treatment. Patients with refractory status epilepticus require a physician with expertise in epilepsy. Treatment options include pentobarbital, high-dose phenobarbital, or inhalation anesthetic agents.",

The present microwave extractions were performed in an 'atmospheric pressure' system. Before irradiation with microwaves, an appropriate solvent mixture was added to the buffered specimen. Lidocaine, methadone, diazepam, nordiazepam, propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene were tested as model substances. The quantitation was performed by GC/NPD. The procedure has been applied successfully to a number of forensic cases. The use of microwaves decreases the time of extraction and the solvent consumption.", 
    "43": "This study extends the pharmacological characterization of a novel quantitative murine behavioral method, the mirrored chamber aversion assay, which appears to be selectively sensitive to anxiolytic agents. Behavioral effects of acute diazepam administration were compared with those of the 5-HT1A anxiolytic buspirone and those of ethanol in C57BL/6J mice. These known anxiolytics produced a dose-dependent reduction in avoidance behavior of large magnitude, as evidenced by statistically significant decreases in latency to enter and increases in time spent in the mirrored chamber. Anxiolytic-like effects of these compounds in the mirrored chamber assay differed from those observed by the elevated plus-maze method. The behavioral effects of the test compounds were not due to alteration of locomotor activity. These findings indicate that the murine mirrored chamber assay responds to several agents known to be anxiolytic in man but differs from the plus-maze in the pharmacological spectrum of the anxiolytics to which it is sensitive.",

When a seizure remained clinically uncontrolled, the next step was taken. Step 1: methylphenobarbital 15-35 mg/kg i.v. Step 2: phenytoin 15-35 mg/kg i.v. After an initial loading dose of 15 mg/kg i.v., both the methylphenobarbital and the phenytoin loading dose were stepwise increased until reaching the maximum of 35 mg/kg.

    "50": "In cross-chopped slices from rat thalamus and in the presence of 10 mM LiC1, the cholinergic agonist carbachol stimulated the accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IP2 = [3H]IP1 + [3H]IP2 + [3H]IP3). Best-fit values for the concentration-response curve for carbachol after 60 min incubation yielded an EC50 of 44 +/- 6 microM, maximum effect of 199 +/- 6% of basal accumulation and Hill coefficient (nH) of 1.1 +/- 0.1. Carbachol-induced [3H]IPs accumulation was inhibited by 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP; pKi 9.1) and the p-fluoro analogue of hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pF-HHSiD; pKi 8.1). Concentration-response curves for carbachol were shifted to the right in a parallel fashion by pirenzepine (100, 300 and 100 nM). A Schild plot of the data was linear (slope 0.95 +/- 0.04) and yielded a log KD for pirenzepine of -6.8 +/- 0.1. Taken together, these results suggest that carbachol-induced inositol phosphate accumulation in rat thalamus is mediated by muscarinic M3-receptors.", 
    "51": "The neurotoxicity of the glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainate was quantitatively assessed in murine spinal cord and cortical cultures prepared under identical conditions. Compared with cortical neurons, spinal neurons were less vulnerable to NMDA (EC50 for 24 h exposure about 30 microM versus 10 microM in cortical cultures) and more vulnerable to AMPA (EC50 5 microM versus 12 microM) and kainate (EC50 20 microM versus 50 microM). Neurons subject to kainate-activated cobalt uptake, a marker of calcium-permeable AMPA/kainate channels, were resistant to NMDA in both systems; these cells were significantly more prevalent in spinal cord cultures. Both the AMPA/kainate antagonist GYKI-52466 and the NMDA antagonist MK-801 attenuated spinal cord neuronal loss due to glucose deprivation; however, GYKI-52466 was more effective. These results support the hypothesis that AMPA/kainate receptor activation may play a significant role in excitotoxic injury to spinal cord neurons.",

Replacement of the inner urea NH and addition of a methyl group to generate a C-3 quaternary carbon resulted in acetamide 6, which showed CCK-A receptor binding selectivity and sub-micromolar agonist activity in vitro. Benzodiazepine 6 was active in an in vivo mouse gallbladder emptying assay and represents a novel orally active, binding selective CCK-A agonist.", 
    "53": "The synthesis and cardiovascular characterization of a series of novel pyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]-benzothiazepine derivatives (54-68) are described. Selective peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands, such as PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864, have recently been found to possess low but significant inhibitory activity of L-type calcium channels, and this property is implicated in the cardiovascular effects observed with these compounds. In functional studies both PK 11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxa mide) and Ro 5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) did not display selectivity between cardiac and vascular tissue. Therefore, several 7-(acyloxy)-6-arylpyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepines, potent and selective peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands recently developed by us (3, 7-20), were subjected to calcium channel receptor binding assay. Some of these compounds showed an unexpected potency in displacing the binding of [3H]nitrendipine from L-type calcium channels, much higher than that reported for PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 and equal to or higher than that of reference calcium antagonists such as verapamil and (+)-cis-diltiazem. Specifically, in rat cortex homogenate, our prototypic PBR ligand 7-acetoxy-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepine (3) showed an IC50 equal to 0.13 nM for inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding. Furthermore, in functional studies this compound displayed a clear-cut selectivity for cardiac over vascular tissue. Comparison of calcium antagonist activity on guinea pig aorta strips with the negative inotropic activity, determined by using isolated guinea pig left atria, revealed that 3 displayed higher selectivity than the reference (+)-cis-diltiazem. Thus, the pyrrolobenzothiazepine 3 might represent a new tool for characterizing the relationship between the PBR and cardiac function. Furthermore, we have also investigated the structural dependence of binding to PBR and L-type calcium channels, and this study allowed us to identify a new class of potent calcium channel blockers selective for cardiac over vascular tissue, with no affinity for PBR. A number of structure-activity relationship trends have been identified, and a possible explanation is advanced in order to account for the observed differences in selectivity. Three structural features, namely, (i) the saturation of the C(6)-C(7) double bond, with a consequent higher molecular flexibility, (ii) the presence of a substituent in the benzofused ring, and (iii) a basic side chain at C-10 of the pyrrolobenzothiazepine ring system, were found to be responsible for potent L-type calcium channel antagonism and clear-cut selectivity for cardiac over vascular tissue. Among the synthesized compounds the pyrrolobenzothiazepine 62 was found to be the most promising selective calcium channel blocker. Additionally, the molecular structure determination of the key intermediate 48 by X-ray diffraction, molecular modeling, and NMR analysis is reported.", 
    "54": "The synthesis and binding activity at the benzodiazepine receptor of some 2-substituted pyrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolines are reported. The structure-activity relationships and in vitro efficacy of the title compounds, which are devoid of the proton acceptor atom at position 1, are similar to those of some previously reported tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds. This suggests that a proton acceptor at position 1 is an optional binding site of a benzodiazepine receptor ligand which only affects potency.", 
    "55": "Some aspects of a defense against an oxidative stress are reviewed. All these aspects are focused on the necessity to defend mtDNA against damage. Protecting mechanisms involve the regulation of mitochondrial transport of nucleic acids, and the development of antioxygen defense as preventive measures. In the first case an exclusive role is supposed to play the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor and components, regulating the activity of its participants (mitochondrial porin and adenine nucleotide translocator). The possible transport of nucleic acids through Ca(2+)-dependent permeability transition pore, representing one of the functional states of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, is put forth. Such mechanisms can also cover the genomic nuclear-mitochondrial exchange. The second aspect reviews the possible complex of measures to lower the harmful effect of oxygen. Among these measures are mild uncoupling, the opening of a permeability transition pore and cellular apoptosis as was recently suggested by Skulachev. Problems such as cellular aging and mitochondrial diseases, are discussed in light of the relevance to the problem of oxidative stress.", 
    "56": "Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) is a clinical phenomenon in which individuals, after acute or intermittent exposure to one or more chemicals, commonly organophosphate pesticides (OPs), become overly sensitive to a wide variety of chemically-unrelated compounds, which can include ethanol, caffeine and other psychotropic drugs. The Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats were selectively bred to be more sensitive to the OP diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) compared to their control counterparts, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats. The present paper will summarize evidence which indicates that the FSL rats exhibit certain similarities to individuals with MCS. In addition to their greater sensitivity to DFP, the FSL rats are more sensitive to nicotine and the muscarinic agonists arecoline and oxotremorine, suggesting that the number of cholinergic receptors may be increased, a conclusion now supported by biochemical evidence. The FSL rats have also been found to exhibit enhanced responses to a variety of other drugs, including the serotonin agonists m-chlorophenylpiperazine and 8-OH-DPAT, the dopamine antagonist raclopride, the benzodiazepine diazepam, and ethanol. MCS patients report enhanced responses to many of these drugs, indicating some parallels between FSL rats and MCS patients. The FSL rats also exhibit reduced activity and appetite and increased REM sleep relative to their FRL controls. Because these behavioral features and the enhanced cholinergic responses are also observed in human depressives, the FSL rats have been proposed as a genetic animal model of depression. It has also been reported that MCS patients have a greater incidence of depression, both before and after onset of their chemical sensitivities, so cholinergic supersensitivity may be a state predisposing individuals to depressive disorders and/or MCS. Further exploration of the commonalities and differences between MCS patients, human depressives, and FSL rats will help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying MCS and could lead to diagnostic approaches and treatments beneficial to MCS patients.", 
    "57": "After discovering that binding to GABAB receptors in rat neocortex varied as a function of the estrous cycle of the rat, we asked whether either or both of the major ovarian steroids could affect binding to GABAB receptors in the same way, namely, by regulating the apparent density (Bmax) of GABAB receptors. We report here that in ovariectomized rats, subcutaneous injection of progesterone alone, without the necessity of estrogen priming, increased the Bmax of baclofen binding to GABAB receptors in the neocortex. Radioimmunoassay of plasma progesterone before and after progesterone injections revealed that plasma progesterone levels similar to those reached during the progesterone surge in proestrus were associated with increased baclofen binding. The effect of progesterone upon baclofen binding was evident 4 h but not 1 h following progesterone treatment. There was some specificity with respect to the cortical receptors affected by progesterone in that under our conditions, progesterone did not increase agonist binding to 5-HT1A or GABAA receptors. We interpret our results to indicate that progesterone variation during the estrous cycle could be responsible for a component of the regulation of GABAB receptors that occurs in neocortex during the estrous cycle of the rat.", 
    "58": "The hypothesis that benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia is due to a specific enhancement of the palatability of foods has been supported by previous 'taste reactivity' studies of affective (hedonic and aversive) reactions to taste palatability. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide enhance hedonic reactions of rats (rhythmic tongue protrusions, etc.) to sweet tastes in a receptor-specific fashion. A role for brainstem circuits has been indicated by a previous demonstration of the persistence of the taste reactivity enhancement by diazepam after midbrain decerebration. The present study examined whether benzodiazepine brainstem receptors are the chief substrates for palatability enhancement even in intact brains. We compared the effectiveness of benzodiazepine microinjections to elicit feeding and enhance hedonic reactions when delivered into either the lateral ventricle (forebrain) or the fourth ventricle (brainstem) of rats. The results show diazepam is reliably more effective at eliciting feeding and enhancing positive hedonic reactions to oral sucrose when microinjections are made in the fourth ventricle than in the lateral ventricle. We conclude that brainstem neural systems containing benzodiazepine-GABA receptors are likely to be the chief substrates for benzodiazepine-induced palatability enhancement.", 
    "59": "1. Muscarinic receptor subtypes mediating neurogenic mucus secretion in ferret trachea were characterized in vitro and in vivo using 35SO4 as a label for secreted mucus, and the muscarinic receptor antagonists telenzepine for the M1 receptor subtype, methoctramine for the M2 subtype and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) for the M3 receptor. We also performed receptor binding and mapping studies. 2. Each muscarinic antagonist displaced [N-methyl-3H]scopolamine binding with high-affinity binding constant (KH) values of 1.9, 2.7 and 5.0 nM for telenzepine, methoctramine and 4-DAMP, respectively. Muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors localized to submucosal glands, whereas M2 receptors did not. 3. In vitro, electrical stimulation (50 V, 10 Hz, 0.5 ms for 5 min) increased 35SO4 output by 160%. Telenzepine did not inhibit the neurogenic secretory response at concentrations two-or twentyfold its KH value, nor did it inhibit secretion induced by acetylcholine (ACh). 4-DAMP inhibited neurogenic secretion by 80 and 95%, respectively, at concentrations two-and twentyfold its KH value, and also inhibited ACh-induced secretion. Methoctramine potentiated neurogenic secretion induced at 2.5 Hz (50 V, 0.5 ms for 5 min) in a dose-related (5.4-100 nM) manner with increases of 33-451% above electrically stimulated values. Methoctramine did not potentiate secretion induced at 10 Hz and did not have any effect on ACh-induced secretion. 4. In vivo, vagal stimulation (10 V, 10 Hz, 2 ms for 8 min) increased output of 35SO4 by approximately 120%. Telenzepine had no significant effect on neurogenic secretion. Methoctramine approximately doubled the stimulated response, whereas 4-DAMP abolished the stimulated secretory response. 5. We conclude that in ferret trachea, cholinergic nerve stimulation increases mucus secretion via muscarinic M3 receptors on the submucosal glands. The magnitude of the secretory response is regulated by neuronal M2 muscarinic receptors. The muscarinic M1 receptors localized to the submucosal glands do not appear to be involved with mucus secretion.", 
    "60": "The anticonvulsant effects of NNC 14-0185 (3-(3-cyclopropyl-5-isoxazolyl)-6-fluoro-5-morpholino-imidazo[1,5- a] quinazoline) and NNC 14-0189 (3-(5-cyclopropyl-1,2, 4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-7-fluoro-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-imidazo[1,5- a] quinazoline) in mice and rats were evaluated and compared with those of diazepam, clonazepam and the novel beta-carboline, abecarnil. Following i.p. administration, NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 prevented audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice and the clonic convulsions induced in mice by pentylenetetrazole, DMCM (methyl 6, 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), 3-mercaptopropionic acid and a low dose of bicuculline. NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 prevented seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole in rats and were also effective anticonvulsants in amygdala-kindled rats. In general, the anticonvulsant potencies of NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 were comparable to those of the reference benzodiazepines. However, like abecarnil, they were not effective against the seizures induced in mice by maximal electroshock and a high dose of bicuculline. The anticonvulsant effects of NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures were apparent within 5 min of i.p. injection and persisted for at least 2 h. These effects appeared to be mediated by benzodiazepine receptors since they were inhibited by concurrent administration of flumazenil. Both NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 showed greater separation between their anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects (measured as impaired rotarod performance) than did diazepam. In this respect, their therapeutic windows were similar (NNC 14-0185) to or better (NNC 14-0189) than that of abecarnil. Tolerance did not develop to the anticonvulsant effects of NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 over a 4-day test. In comparison, the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and abecarnil were attenuated by repeated drug administration. Thus, NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 have a promising anticonvulsant and side-effect profile in comparison with diazepam, clonazepam and abecarnil. The potential use of these compounds in the treatment of epilepsy should be explored further.", 
    "61": "Rat cortical synaptosomes preloaded with [3H]choline were superfused and stimulated with K+ in order to investigate the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine on the in vitro release of acetylcholine (ACh). Tacrine was found to biphasically both increase (10(-6) and 5 x 10(-6) M) and decrease (10(-5)-10(-4) M) the release of ACh in a concentration-dependent manner. The facilitatory effect of tacrine was prevented by atropine and the M1 antagonist pirenzepine, whereas the inhibitory effect induced by tacrine was blocked by atropine and the M2 antagonist AF-DX 116. These results indicate that tacrine causes a biphasic effect on K+ stimulated ACh release in the brain via M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors. The tacrine induced enhancement of the ACh release occurs at clinical relevant tacrine concentrations and might therefore be of importance for the treatment outcome of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "62": "2-Arylimidazo[4,5-c]quinolines and analogous fused imidazopyridines were synthesized and evaluated as benzodiazepine receptor ligands. Affinity to the receptors was greatly affected by the bulkiness of the aryl group at the 2-position, compared to the pyrazoloquinolines such as CGS-9896. Derivatives with an isoxazole moiety at the 2-position showed high binding affinity and in vivo activity. In the imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline series, substitution at the 6-position decreased or abolished activity. Most derivatives with an unsubstituted isoxazolyl group showed antagonist or inverse agonist activity except for the 7-halo analogues, which exhibited agonist activity. On the other hand, 5-methylisoxazol-3-yl or 3-methylisoxazol-5-yl derivatives generally exhibited agonist activity. A similar substitution effect on the isoxazole moiety was observed in the imidazopyridines fused with a nonaromatic ring. From the detailed pharmacological evaluation, S-8510, 2-(3-isoxazolyl)-3,6,7,9-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d]pyrano++ +[4,3-b]pyridine monophosphate, possessing weak inverse agonist activity was selected as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of some symptoms of senile dementia.", 
    "63": "The influence of naloxone and naltrexone on the hypnotic and protective efficacy of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam and estazolam against electroshock- and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures was studied in mice. Naloxone and naltrexone significantly decreased the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and estazolam, but they did not changed that of chlordiazepoxide and clonazepam in electroshock-induced tonic hindlimb extension. Protective effects of benzodiazepines against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures were slightly diminished by naloxone and naltrexone (16 mg/kg). Opioid antagonists were able to reduce the duration of benzodiazepines-induced sleep at high dose (32 mg/kg) only. These findings suggest that the endogenous opioid system may participate in antiepileptic effects of benzodiazepines but not in their hypnotic activity.", 
    "64": "Whereas benzodiazepines are routinely coadministered with tricyclic antidepressants, in patients undergoing treatment for depressive disorders, little information is known about the combination of benzodiazepines with other antidepressants such as specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's), and combination with other anxiolytic drugs. On the other hand, it is known that benzodiazepines decrease the serotoninergic transmission. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of concomittant administration of anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam) or diphenylmethane derivative (hydroxyzine) with specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, indalpine) on the ability of antidepressant drugs to reverse helpless behavior in this test. Our results show that: daily injection of diazepam (0.25-2 mg/kg), lorazepam (0.06-0.25 mg/kg) or hydroxyzine (8.32 mg/kg) failed to reverse the behavioral deficit in rat. In contrast fluvoxamine: 4 mg/kg/day; fluoxetine: 4 mg/kg/day; indalpine: 1 mg/kg/day significantly reverse the helpless behavior in this test; the reversal of helpless behavior by fluvoxamine or indalpine was dose-dependently antagonized by daily coadministration of diazepam or lorazepam; in contrast, the reversal of helpless behavior by fluvoxamine or fluoxetine was not modified by daily coadministration of hydroxyzine (8 mg/kg). In conclusion, it may be suggested that combined benzodiazepine-specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors, should be avoided. We suggest that anxiolytic drugs such as hydroxyzine might be better in coadministration with antidepressants, particularly with specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors.", 
    "65": "The models of mitochondrial transmembrane nucleic acid transfer are discussed. According to this hypothesis, mitochondria can exchange their nucleic acids by two possible mechanisms including either intermitochondrial fusion and fission or transmembrane transport. In the latter case, important roles for mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor and factors that regulate activities of its components (mitochondrial porin and adenine nucleotide translocator) are suggested. Nucleic acids can be transported through a Ca(2+)-dependent pore that can be one of the functional states of mitochondrial exchange of genetic material. Problems like cellular aging, apoptosis, proliferation, mitochondrial diseases, multidrug resistance, intracellular traffic, and mitochondrial heredity are discussed considering an important role of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor in these processes.",

The duration of the study was 6 weeks, with a mandatory titration (ascending doses of 3-18 mg/day) period of 14 days. The assessment criteria for tolerability were the frequency of adverse events (including EPS), vital signs and laboratory tests. The efficacy criteria, which were only descriptively analysed, were: (a) Clinical Global Impression (CGI, percentage of \"very much\" and \"much\" improvement); and (b) change in BPRS total score (e.g. percentage of patients showing > or = 40% decrease of BPRS score at the end of the treatment). Sixty-six patients (aged 21-62 years) with acute episodes of schizophrenia of moderate to marked severity (mean BPRS score = 46.3, range 26-76) were included in the study. Of these 66 patients (68%) were reportedly non-responders (n = 10) or partial responders (n = 35) to previous neuroleptic therapy. Twenty patients (30%) terminated the trial prematurely due to therapeutic failure (no improvement or worsening after 2 weeks of treatment), 17% of patients dropped out due to other reasons (transfer to other hospitals, withdrawal of consent, intercurrent diseases) and 4.5% of patients stopped the treatment due to adverse reactions. Four patients (6%) showed early complete remission and refused to be further treated. The analysis of efficacy (intention-to-treat) revealed a sustained decrease of BPRS scores with 49% of patients showing > or = 40% BPRS score change by the end of the treatment. Forty-four per cent of patients improved \"very much\" or \"much\". Eleven patients (17%) were full responders (BPRS score decrease 75-100%) and 21 patients (32%) showed at least 40% reduction of BPRS score. The reduction of BPRS scores in completers only was 60%. All BPRS factor scores decreased in parallel and, particularly, no preferential decrease of anxiety/depression subscores was found. The analysis of tolerability showed that 59% of patients presented no complaints at all. The most frequent treatment-related adverse reactions in the remaining patients were: sedation (n = 14), dizziness (n = 4) and headache (n = 3). The results of this study suggest moderate antipsychotic efficacy of bretazenil in schizophrenic patients. They encourage further investigations of partial benzodiazepine-receptor agonists in this indication, particularly because of the excellent tolerability and lack of extrapyramidal side-effects.", 
    "81": "We have studied the effects of food deprivation and adrenalectomy on the induction by RU486 of female rat liver microsomal CYP3A apoprotein, erythromycin N-demethylase and diazepam C3-hydroxylase activities. RU486 was a potent inducer of CYP3A apoprotein in intact animals and food deprivation enhanced this response. Food deprivation alone caused only weak CYP3A apoprotein induction suggesting a synergistic interaction in the regulation of protein expression. These results were reflected in the measurements of diazepam C3-hydroxylase activity. This confirms diazepam C3-hydroxylase as a useful and easily measured index of CYP3A monooxygenase content in female rat liver microsomes. Erythromycin N-demethylase did not show concordance with this pattern; this monooxygenase was much more strongly induced by food deprivation alone than by RU486 administration and, in addition, adrenalectomy abolished the induction response to food deprivation. The lack of correspondence between the apoprotein and erythromycin N-demethylase results suggests that non-CYP3A or novel, hitherto uncharacterized CYP3A isoforms may contribute to erythromycin N-demethylation in female rats. The close agreement between the results for CYP3A apoprotein and diazepam C3-hydroxylase indicates that although RU486 possesses a terminal acetylenic moeity it does not, at the dosages used here, cause mechanism-based inactivation of the CYP3A monooxygenase protein it induces. Current studies are directed to characterizing the particular CYP3A isoform(s) whose production is stimulated by RU486.", 
    "82": "We have already demonstrated the presence of antibodies in the sera of chagasic patients with the ability to interact with neurotransmitter receptors triggering several intracellular pathways of transduction signals. Here we show that, chagasic IgG induced protein kinase C (PKC) translocation to rat cardiac membranes and this effect was inhibited by muscarinic cholinergic blockers atropine and AF-DX 116 pointing to the participation of M2 receptors in this effect. It was also able to stimulate nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and this action was blunted by phospholipase C (PLC) and PKC inhibitors indicating that the production of nitric oxide (NO) would be the consequence of the cascade of enzymatic pathways triggered by mAChR activation. PKC and NOS activities were involved in chagasic IgG negative inotropic actions on rat isolated myocardium as its effects were blunted by staurosporine and L-N-monomethyl arginine. Furthermore, low concentrations of chagasic IgG inhibited the cardiac mechanical action of carbachol in a non-competitive manner. These data suggested that PKC activation in myocardium by chagasic IgG would be involved in its physiological actions by modulating NOS activity. The participation of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of mAChR leading to receptor desensitization as one of the causes of dysautonomia is also discussed.", 
    "83": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8s) is an endogenous stimulus of gastric pepsinogen secretion. Previous studies with isolated guinea pig chief cells indicated that this process is mediated through the CCKA receptor subtype, with an additional contribution from CCKB receptors. For comparison, we examined the mechanism of CCK-8s stimulated pepsinogen secretion in a larger nonrodent species, using highly enriched porcine chief cells as a functional in vitro model. Porcine chief cells responded weakly to stimulation by CCK-8s alone, but the efficacy was markedly enhanced in the presence of 10 mumol l-1 forskolin. Under these conditions, pepsinogen secretion was potently stimulated by CCK-8s and the CCKA receptor selective heptapeptide, A-71,378 (EC50 = 4.7 and 33 nmol l-1), but not by CCKB receptor selective agonists. The prototype CCKA receptor selective antagonist L-364,718 blocked pepsinogen secretion with approximately 2,000-fold higher affinity than the CCKB receptor selective analogue, L-365,260. This functional profile was consistent with the affinity rank order of all tested compounds at CCKA-receptor-like [125I]-BH-CCK-8s binding sites in the porcine gastric mucosa. Comparison with cloned CCKA receptors from other species revealed that the receptors mediating pepsinogen secretion in the pig have similar pharmacology, possibly with slight differences in agonist potencies. In contrast to the guinea pig, porcine CCKB receptors appear to have no direct role in pepsinogen secretion.", 
    "84": "1. It has been reported that subconvulsive doses of convulsant agents such as strychnine and pentylenetetrazole can enhance memory in rodents studied under various behavioral procedures. The present study was designed to determine if similar results might be obtained in squirrel monkeys. 2. Responding by squirrel monkeys was maintained by food presentation under a repeated acquisition of behavioral chains procedure. Each subject acquired a different three-response chain each session. 3. Sequence completions were reinforced under a fixed-ratio 5 schedule (FR 5) and errors produced a brief timeout. After the subject reached a predetermined acquisition criterion, the session was stopped and a 24 hr delay was interposed. Following the delay, the subject was retested on the same discrimination and retention was quantified as percent savings. 4. When administered immediately after the subject reached the acquisition criterion, strychnine (0.0056 -0.18 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazole (0.32-42 mg/kg) neither enhanced nor disrupted percent savings under the 24 hour delay. Similarly, the delta opioid agonist, BW373U86 (0.0056-3.2 mg/kg) [(+/-)-4 -((alpha-R*)-alpha-((2S*,5R*)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl -1-piperazinyl)-3-hydroxybenzyl)-N,N-diethylbenzamide dihydrochloride], had little or no effect on percent savings following a 24 hr delay. This was true even at doses of BW373U86 which produced convulsions. In contrast, triazolam (1-1.8 mg/kg) decreased percent savings following the 24 hr delay at doses which had little or no effect on response rate. 5. These results suggest that at subconvulsive doses, convulsant agents have little or no effect on memory storage, while at higher doses agents such as triazolam can disrupt memory processes in squirrel monkeys.", 
    "85": "1. After pretraining in an undrugged state, young (6 months) and aged (18-24 months) rats were trained on a spatial learning-set task after receiving one of four doses of diazepam (1, 2, 3 or 5 mg/kg) or the drug vehicle. The effects of 5 mg/kg of diazepam were also assessed on the spatial learning-set task one full hour after injection (delay condition) as well as on the visible platform task. 2. During pretraining (undrugged), aged rats demonstrated a transient impairment on the visible platform task but subsequently did not differ significantly from young rats on the submerged platform task. On the spatial learning-set task, aged rats performed as well as young rats under control conditions and diazepam produced a comparable dose-dependent impairment of spatial learning. However, when the 1 hr delay was interposed between diazepam administration and maze testing, only aged rats exhibited a spatial learning impairment. Diazepam did not impair performance on the visible platform task in either young or aged rats. 3. These results indicate that although the amnesic effect of diazepam is not initially greater in aged rats, it persists for longer periods.", 
    "86": "Administration of medications which affect brain dopamine and serotonin levels are occasionally associated with neurotoxic behavioral and autonomic syndromes, variously described as the neuroleptic malignant (NMS) and the toxic serotonin (TSS) syndromes. Based on concepts of the presumed brain mechanisms of action of the drugs, different corrective interventions have been recommended. We describe a case of neurotoxic syndrome with characteristics indistinguishable from NMS in which the offending agents are those which affect the serotonin and not the dopamine systems. The patient recovered with lorazepam and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We argue that NMS and TSS are examples of a non-specific generalized neurotoxic syndrome, and not specific syndromes: and that these are subtypes of catatonia. Patients today should be treated with benzodiazepines, and if these fail, with ECT, interventions which are effective in relieving catatonia.", 
    "87": "This paper reviews the literature on the epidemiological, biological and clinical features of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal syndrome, focusing on clinical problems associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepine (BZs) in mood and anxiety disorders. These conditions represent the most frequent mental disorders for which BZs are overprescribed. In addition to dependence and withdrawal phenomena, the presence of chronic subtle toxicity and the interference with the underlying psychopathology observed with BZ use suggests a need for a more careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio in the long-term administration of BZs.", 
    "88": "This double-blind, crossover study assessed physiology and behaviour following administration of two oral ketamine-diazepam sedation regimens (4 mg/kg and 8 mg/ kg ketamine in conjunction with 0.1 mg/kg diazepam). Clinical success was achieved in 50% of sedations with 4 mg/kg and 78% of sedations with 8 mg/kg with no significant differences between the two regimens (Fisher's exact test). Within the crossover group, clinical success was achieved in 56% of sedations with 4 mg/kg and 87% of sedations with 8 mg/kg with no significant differences between the two regimens (Fisher's exact). Although clinically insignificant, ANOVA revealed statistical elevations in blood pressures and heart rates and decreases in oxygen saturations (P < 0.05). The 4-mg/kg regimen resulted in more negative behavior and less sleep. The 8-mg/kg regimen resulted in less negative behavior and more sleep.", 
    "89": "Midazolam in combination with nitrous oxide (N2O) is a commonly used sedative approach for pediatric dental patients. Respiratory morbidity and mortality have been reported with midazolam administration, particularly when used in combination with other drugs in the absence of supplemental oxygen. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of midazolam alone and in combination with N2O on respiration in laboratory rats by measuring arterial blood gas levels. Sixty-four Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 250-320 g, were assigned to one of eight groups (eight per group). Groups were allocated based upon the dosage of midazolam administered (0, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mg/kg i.p.) and exposure to N2O/02 (50%/50%) or room air. Arterial blood was obtained from a femoral artery catheter and pH, O2, CO2 (mm Hg), and oxygen saturation (%) were determined. Samples were analyzed using a System 1306 pH/Blood Gas Analyzer. Baseline arterial blood gasses were obtained for each animal and at 15-min intervals following midazolam administration throughout the 45-min experiment. Following midazolam administration, animals were placed into a sealed chamber through which flowed either N2O or room air. Group comparisons demonstrated that: 1) arterial CO2 levels increased in midazolam-exposed animals breathing room air, but not in those exposed to N2O (P < 0.05), and 2) as expected, N2O/O2-exposed animals showed an increase in arterial O2 and a %saturation that was not observed in room air groups (P < 0.01). This investigation demonstrated that coadministration of N2O/O to midazolam-exposed animals did not result in hypercarbia, an early indicator of respiratory depression.", 
    "90": "Certain endogenously occurring 3 alpha-hydroxylated, 5-reduced pregnane steroids act at a specific site on the GABAA receptor complex (GRC) to modulate the effects of GABA at its receptor. Modulators that potentiate GABA at the GABAA receptor often possess anxiolytic properties. The anxiolytic potential of four 5-reduced, 3 alpha, 20-pregnanediols, differing only in the stereochemical orientation of the steroid A-ring and the 20-hydroxyl group, were tested in the Vogel test following intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration. The effects of these pregnanediols were compared to those of their 20-ketone analogues, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-P) and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha, 5 beta-P). All four pregnanediols tested significantly enhanced punished drinking at doses ranging from 10 to 60 micrograms. The rank order of potency based on the minimum effective dose (MED) observed was 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol = 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol > 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha,20 beta-diol > 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha, 20 beta-diol. 3 alpha,5 beta-P and 3 alpha,5 alpha-P enhanced punished responding when administered at 2.5 and 5 micrograms, respectively. 3 beta,5 alpha-P which is inactive at the GRC was also inactive (up to 100 micrograms) in the Vogel test. The benzodiazepine control diazepam was efficacious when administered at 2.5 micrograms. 5 alpha-Pregnan-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol was further tested in the mouse elevated plus-maze model following systemic administration where it was found to be active in a dose range of 10-40 mg/kg IP. These results raise the possibility that in addition to 3 alpha,5 alpha-P and 3 alpha,5 beta-P, some of their endogenously occurring pregnanediol metabolites may also influence physiological processes related to anxiety via the GRC.", 
    "91": "Twenty volunteers were trained to discriminate between 75 mg tripelennamine (TP) and placebo. During the first four sessions, the drugs were identified prior to ingestion by letter code. During the next six sessions, the procedure was the same except the capsules were not identified. At the end of the 3-h session, participants indicated which capsule they believed they received using the letter codes. When correct, they received a monetary bonus. If they were correct on five sessions, they entered the third phase which had ten additional training and 12 test sessions. During tests, participants received capsules that contained other drugs, including diphenhydramine (50 and 75 mg), chlorpheniramine (4 and 6 mg), diazepam (5 and 10 mg), d-amphetamine (5 and 10 mg), as well as tripelennamine (25, 50 and 75 mg) and placebo. Thirteen participants learned the discrimination and nine entered the third phase. Except for placebo, most participants identified the test compounds as TP and labeled them as sedatives. TP produced significant changes on several subjective and physiological measures. The test compounds produced varied effects which were neither clearly dose-related nor related to the identification as TP or placebo. These results indicate that tripelennamine can function as a discriminative stimulus, but with little evidence of pharmacological specificity.", 
    "92": "Three-hour sessions of differential reinforcement of low-rate behavior (DRL 45-s) in rats were used to investigate alprazolam, caffeine, and their interactions at the onset, peak and disappearance of serum alprazolam, while caffeine level remained constant. The dose-response curve (DRC) method of P\u00f6ch permitted an extensive evaluation of the kind (additivity or independence) of interactions occurring in combined drug effects. The alprazolam and caffeine DRCs were used to derive theoretical additive and independent relations, and the observed combined effects compared to these functions. Behavior-time profiles of the combined effects were similarly compared. Serum alprazolam and caffeine concentrations correlated with their respective behavior-time profiles. No acute tolerance was observed either for the individual drugs or their combinations. Alprazolam was more potent than caffeine in disrupting DRL behavior. Because alprazolam is much shorter-lived (t1/2 = 32 min) than caffeine (t1/2 = 3 h) in rats, potency ratios between alprazolam and caffeine changed across session time (from 123 to 4), which determined the expression of the combined effects. Although the combined effects were not distinguishable in terms of additivity or independence in both the DRCs and in the behavior-time profiles, they showed neither synergism nor antagonism. The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam were not altered by caffeine, but those of caffeine were affected by alprazolam.", 
    "93": "The fear-potentiated startle response paradigm is used to investigate anxiolytic properties of drugs. The first objective of the present study was to further investigate the predictive validity of this paradigm. The anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg/ kg IP) and oxazepam (1-10 mg/kg PO) and the putative anxiolytic flesinoxan (1-10 mg/kg PO) decreased startle potentiation dose-dependently, indicating an anxiolytic effect. The antidepressant fluvoxamine (5-20 mg/kg PO) did not affect startle potentiation. Ideally, anxiolytic drugs attenuate startle potentiation without affecting control startle levels, although some studies report altered control startle amplitudes. The second objective was to investigate whether different effects on control startle amplitudes are related to different startle devices. Therefore, the drugs were tested in two laboratories. Results showed no significant differences between laboratories, indicating that equipment is not a critical factor in the drug-induced alteration of control startle levels. In an additional experiment, it was shown that flesinoxan (10 mg/kg PO) did not affect strychnine-induced startle potentiation, supporting the idea that the attenuating effect of flesinoxan on the fear-potentiated startle response is due to its anxiolytic properties. Thus, the fear-potentiated startle response paradigm appears a valid and reliable model for anxiolytic properties of drugs.", 
    "94": "We determined the relative contributions of endogenous gastrin, histamine and cholinergic tone to basal acid secretion in chronic fistula rats. Results were compared with those for acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. In chronic fistula rats, YM022 \u00bf(R)-1-[2,3-dihydro-1-(2'-methylphenacyl)-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1 H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]-3-(3-methylphenyl)urea\u00bf dose-dependently inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion and abolished this secretion at 1 mumol/kg, s.c., but did not affect histamine- and carbachol-induced acid secretion even at 10 mumol/kg. In contrast, famotidine at 1 mumol/kg completely inhibited not only the acid secretion induced by histamine but also those by pentagastrin and carbachol. Furthermore, atropine abolished carbachol- and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion and significantly suppressed histamine-stimulated acid secretion at 0.1 mumol/kg. YM022 dose-dependently inhibited basal acid secretion. The YM022 dosage required to inhibit basal acid secretion is consistent with that required to suppress pentagastrin-induced acid secretion. Famotidine (1 mumol/kg) and atropine (0.1 mumol/kg) also abolished basal acid secretion. In pylorus-ligated rats, YM022 inhibited acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner; the inhibition at 1 mumol/kg, i.v. was 65%. No additional effect was observed when rats were dosed at 30 mumol/kg. Famotidine partially inhibited acid secretion in these rats, whereas atropine abolished this secretion. These results indicate that the major part of basal acid secretion in rats is attributable to endogenous gastrin via histamine- and cholinergic tone-dependent pathways. Moreover, pylorus ligation reduces the relative contribution of gastrin to acid secretion due to the activation of cholinergic tone.", 
    "95": "During repeated alcohol withdrawal, convulsive withdrawal behavior has been shown to be increased in a kindling-like manner in both clinical and experimental studies. In the present experiment, quantitative autoradiography was used to investigate binding of tritiated ligands to glutamate receptor subtypes and the benzodiazepine/GABA (BZ/GABA) receptor complex in rats exposed to 14 episodes of alcohol withdrawal. Seizures were detected in 25% of the animals during withdrawal episode 10-13. Repeated alcohol withdrawal resulted in a decrease in the number of [3H]-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ([3H]-AMPA) binding sites in striatum and sub-regions of the entorhinal cortex, the cerebellum and the hippocampus, while the [3H]-flunitrazepam binding was down-regulated in the frontal cortex. There was no differences between the controls and the multiple withdrawal animals regarding the [3H]-dizocilpine ([3H]-MK801) binding and the [3H]-kainic acid binding. However, within the latter group, those animals in which withdrawal seizures were observed had increased [3H]-MK801 binding sites in focal regions of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, compared to those in which seizures were not observed. The decreased AMPA binding suggested impaired glutamate neurotransmission. As such, this receptor probably did not contribute to alcohol withdrawal kindling, but rather was involved in seizure protective mechanisms during this process.",

In the light of newly acquired neurophysiological data on the microstructure of sleep, this paper reconsiders the problem of insomnia and the current ideas on polysomnography and hypnotic drugs.", 
    "97": "Ketamine, when used as a mono-anaesthetic, does not appear to induce surgical anaesthesia in the pig. The addition of other drugs such as opioids, benzodiazepines and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists deepens anaesthesia and enables major surgery to be performed. A decision-tree for the rational use of ketamine for both short and long-term anaesthesia in the pig under three different levels of procedure severity is presented.", 
    "98": "1. The effects of oxotremorine and pilocarpine on striatal acetylcholine (ACh) release were investigated using brain microdialysis techniques in urethan-anesthetized rats. 2. Oxotremorine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg, IV), a preferential M2 agonist, dose-dependently decreased ACh release in the striatum. On the other hand, pilocarpine, at 5 mg/kg (IV), showed a tendency to decrease ACh release in the striatum but, at 7.5 and 10 mg/kg (IV), significantly enhanced release in a dose-dependent manner. 3. The effect of oxotremorine was blocked by scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg, IV) but not by pirenzepine (10 mg/kg, IV), a selective M1 antagonist. 4. Pilocarpine (10 mg/kg, IV) enhancement of striatal ACh release was not affected by 10 mg/kg pirenzepine, but 5 mg/kg pilocarpine significantly increased ACh release in scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg)-pretreated rats without affecting the release by itself. 5. These results suggest that oxotremorine-induced decrease in striatal ACh release is due to stimulation of presynaptic M2 autoreceptor, and that the increase of striatal ACh release by pilocarpine is mediated by mechanism(s) other than effects on muscarinic ACh receptors.", 
    "99": "Monitored patient-controlled sedation (MPCS) is a technique that allows patients to administer intravenous sedatives, under the supervision of an anaesthetist, to achieve a level of conscious sedation that meets their individual requirements. Experience to date has shown that this technique is effective and highly acceptable to patients. Propofol is an appropriate choice of agent for MPCS. Criteria for such agents include short arm-brain circulation time, which results in a rapid and clearly defined onset of action. The MPCS technique offers a number of benefits to the patient and the theatre staff.", 
    "100": "Patients undergoing surgery under regional anaesthesia may be anxious, uncomfortable or in pain. Therefore, effective sedation throughout the procedure is an important aspect of patient management. The balanced sedation technique uses combinations of sedatives to meet the anxiolytic and analgesic needs of the individual patient. For example, benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytics, while propofol can be used to provide a suitable level of sedation, especially in patients who have expressed a wish to remain asleep during the procedure. Analgesics should be considered only in those patients who are likely to experience pain during the procedure. Basic measures to increase the comfort of the patient and to facilitate the effect of pharmacological methods include supplementary non-pharmacological techniques, for example the use of a soft mattress to prevent back pain, infusion of warmed fluids and a warm operating atmosphere. This may extend to the opportunity for patients to listen to music if they have a fear of the sounds associated with the operating room, such as technical discussions by surgical staff or the sound of surgical instruments being used and discarded. The balanced sedation technique can, therefore, help to achieve the ideal goal of a comfortable patient who is free from anxiety and pain, and can sleep if desired.", 
    "101": "Patient management is a vital component of regional anaesthesia, and the appropriate method and level of sedation must be chosen for each patient on an individual basis. This may range from simple distraction through pharmacologically induced anxiolysis or hypnosis, to light general anaesthesia by the inhalational or intravenous routes. Intravenous sedation is most widely used and suitable agents include the benzodiazepines, the intravenous induction agents and the opioids. Currently, midazolam and propofol are considered to be the most suitable drugs. Patient safety must never be compromised and pharmacological sedation must be administered by a trained practitioner, with appropriate patient monitoring and provision of supplementary oxygen.",

Thirty patients, ASA I or II, without cardiovascular disease, electrolyte abnormalities or receiving any medication were studied. All patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.08 mg kg-1 i.m., 30-60 min prior to surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with either midazolam 0.4 mg kg-1 i.v., (15 patients) or propofol 1 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus, followed by a continuous infusion (15 patients). ECG, heart rate and arterial pressure were measured before induction of anaesthesia and at 1 and 3 min after the bolus of midazolam or propofol. Further recordings were obtained at 1 and 3 min after a bolus of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v. and also immediately after tracheal intubation and 1 min later. Neither midazolam nor propofol had any significant effect on QTc interval. Prolongation of QTc was observed in both groups after suxamethonium and this was further prolonged following intubation.

Neurotoxicity consisted in mental status changes, tremor, headache (grade 1), visual disturbance and cortical blindness (grade 2) and seizures and coma (grade 3). The overall toxicity was 28.8% and the incidence of convulsions was 10.1%. Neurological findings were reversible after temporary reduction or discontinuation of CsA. Class 3 patients, when prepared with protocol 6 (Bu 14 + Cy 200 and CsA for GVHD) or when they developed acute GVHD, had the highest risk of convulsions. Age, sex, different conditioning regimens, different anticonvulsive prophylaxis, liver damage due to iron-overload and/or to chronic inflammation did not influence the occurrence of CsA-related CNS toxicity.

A history of treatment for alcohol abuse was a very strong risk factor for falls among both men (odds ratio, 10.7) and women (odds ratio, 4.3). The highest risk of serious injury due to falls was within 15 days of filling the prescription, with an odds ratio of 3.6 for BZD sedatives and 2.6 for BZD tranquillizers. Risk decreased with further increase of time after the BZD fill date. For the individual BZD, flurazepam and triazolam showed the highest increase in risk with odds ratios of 3.4 and 2.7, respectively, while oxazepam, lorazepam and diazepam showed odds ratios of 2.2, 2.0 and 1.8 (all odds ratios mentioned are statistically significant at p < 0.05).", 
    "115": "The European Network of the Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) has collected and evaluated data on 689 pregnancies in which exposure to tricyclic and nontricyclic antidepressants occurred. Data were collected prospectively from the time of in utero exposure and all the cases were followed up to the first few weeks of postnatal life using standardized procedures. In most cases, no longer term follow-up data were available. Approximately two-thirds of the mothers were on multidrug therapy, and of those, half took a benzodiazepine. About 95% of the patients were exposed during the first trimester. The most striking feature of the pregnancy outcomes is that 97% of live-born babies were morphologically normal. The incidence of spontaneous abortion and late fetal/neonatal deaths were within the normal range. Fourteen live-born babies and one fetus had either major or minor malformations, and six had minor anomalies. However, there was no increase in either a particular type of malformation or a specific pattern of defects. Another 31 infants without malformations had neonatal problems; these were usually associated with chronic multidrug therapy, especially near term. Elective termination of pregnancy occurred more frequently in the multidrug groups (86 out of 488) than in the monotherapy groups (20 out of 201), but data concerning the condition of the fetus are not available in the majority of the cases. Overall, no causal relationship could be established between in utero exposure to antidepressants and adverse pregnancy outcome.",

    "121": "In six conscious dogs with chronic gastric and pancreatic fistulas we compared the action of different doses of loxiglumide (2.5 to 10.0 mg/kg/h) and L-364, 718 (0.025 to 0.1 mg/kg/h) on the pancreatic secretory response to intraduodenal perfusion of graded loads of tryptophan (0.37-10.0 mmol/ h), given against a background of secretin (20.5 pmol/kg/h intravenously).", 
    "122": "Both loxiglumide and L-364, 718 inhibited the secretin-stimulated pancreatic bicarbonate output by up to 47% and 48%, respectively. The pancreatic protein output during secretin was significantly inhibited by all doses of L-364,718 (by 65% to 82%) but not by loxiglumide. All doses of loxiglumide and L-364, 718 abolished the 180-min integrated bicarbonate response to tryptophan. The two higher doses of loxiglumide (5.0-10.0 mg/kg/h) and L-364,718 (0.05-0.1 mg/kg/h) significantly decreased the 180-min integrated response to tryptophan by 59% and 79% (loxiglumide) and by 72% and 97% (L-364, 718). The plasma CCK-like immunoreactivity basally and in response to tryptophan was not significantly altered by loxiglumide or L-364, 718.", 
    "123": "These findings indicate that in dogs 1) the pancreatic bicarbonate response to secretin is augmented by the hormone CCK; 2) L-364, 718 but not loxiglumide decreases pancreatic protein output during secretin; 3) endogenous released CCK is involved in the pancreatic bicarbonate response and is a major mediator of pancreatic protein response to intraduodenal tryptophan; and 4) the release of CCK by intraduodenal tryptophan is not influenced by loxiglumide and L-364, 718.",

    "125": "We characterized the effect of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)/lactose ratio and HPMC viscosity grade (molecular weight) on solute release and swelling of matrix tablets. We used a semiquantitative optical imaging method to monitor the swelling of matrices with HPMC content from 20% to 80% (w/w) and four viscosity grades. Several aspects of the swelling process common to all formulations were revealed: (i) swelling is anisotropic with a preferential expansion in the axial direction, (ii) swelling is isotropic with respect to the gel layer thickness and composition in both axial and radial directions, (iii) the gel layer develops in three stages, and (iv) water penetration is Fickian in nature and essentially constant for all formulations. We monitored simultaneously drug, lactose, and HPMC release. Lactose and drug release rates were superimposed, indicating a similar diffusional release mechanism and no interaction with HPMC. The strong dependence of HPMC release on viscosity grade is explained on the basis of the concept of polymer disentanglement concentration. We analyzed drug release rates using a model for a reservoir-type release system that incorporates swelling kinetics. HPMC/lactose ratio modulates drug release rate by altering drug diffusivity, a function of gel composition. In contrast, HPMC viscosity grade impacts matrix dissolution and gel layer thickness development below a critical molecular weight. For slowly dissolving matrices containing high viscosity grade (> 4000 cps) HPMC, similar drug release rates are observed mainly due to the same drug diffusivity as a result of the identical gel composition and thickness. For fast dissolving matrices (< or = 100 cps) swelling inhomogeneity is proposed as being responsible for a higher apparent drug diffusivity and release rate.", 
    "126": "We have examined whether the widely used herbicide, paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'dipyridylium) may accumulate in rat brain following multiple oral dosing (5 mg paraquat ion/kg/day) for 14 days and whether this dosing regime may produce signs of neurotoxicity. This dosing regime may determine whether low dose exposure to mammals may be neurotoxic. Using [14C]paraquat to measure tissue and plasma paraquat concentrations, we observed significantly higher plasma and tissue paraquat concentrations in brain, liver, lungs and kidneys of rats which received multiple doses for 14 days, as compared to paraquat concentrations in tissues of rats which received only a single paraquat dose. Brain paraquat concentrations measured 24 h after dosing were tenfold higher in rats receiving 14 daily oral doses of paraquat, as compared to concentrations following a single oral dose. A neuropathological study of the rat brain yielded no evidence that multiple paraquat dosing resulted in neuronal cell damage. Particular attention was paid to the nigrostriatal system. The paraquat treated rats gained approximately 10% less body weight over the 15 day experimental period as compared with controls demonstrating that the dose of paraquat was toxic to the animals. Measurements of locomotor activity using open field tests or activity monitors did not reveal any statistically significant differences between control animals and those receiving paraquat. Fore- and hind-limb grip strength were not significantly different between the paraquat treated and control rats at any time point during the dosing regime, nor was there any evidence for locomotor coordination deficits in any of the animals receiving paraquat. Densities of dopamine D1 and D2, NMDA, muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex and striatum were not significantly different between controls and rats which had received multiple paraquat doses. Concentrations of catecholamine neurotransmitters in the striatum, hypothalamus and frontal cerebral cortex were also measured to examine whether there was evidence for catecholamine depletion in these brain regions. We did not observe any significant reductions in dopamine, noradrenaline or DOPAC concentrations in any brain region of paraquat treated rats as compared with controls. On the contrary, dopamine concentrations in the striatim were significantly elevated in paraquat treated animals following a 15 day paraquat dosing regime. We attribute these changes in catecholamine concentrations to the general toxicity of paraquat which produces a stress response. In conclusion, we could not find any evidence that multiple paraquat dosing can lead to changes in locomotor activity or grip strength. In addition, the absence of neuropathology or changes in neurochemistry in the nigrostriatal tract demonstrates that paraquat does not behave like MPP+(N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium), the neurotoxic metabolite of MPTP.", 
    "127": "Rates of self-poisoning fell during the 1980s, although recent reports suggest this trend may have reversed.", 
    "128": "Data on all hospital discharges with a diagnosis of deliberate self-poisoning were obtained from the Information and Statistics Division of the NHS in Scotland. Rates of self-poisoning were investigated by overall trend, and for trends by age and by type of drug.", 
    "129": "Deliberate self-poisoning rates for men and women began increasing in the late 1980s, and did so steadily during the early 1990s. Because the rates are increasing faster in men, the traditional excess of self-poisoning among women is being eroded. For men rates increased in all age groups up to the age of 60, but the greatest rise occurred between ages 15-29. For women the increase was largely restricted to 15-24-year-olds, and rates fell among women over the age of 50. Self-poisoning with paracetamol increased most rapidly; in contrast to aspirin which showed little change. Opiate analgesics, antirheumatics, antidepressants and antipsychotics have also shown some increase in their use in both genders. There has been a substantial fall in the use of benzodiazepines in women, but little change among men.",

    "131": "1. Chronic benzodiazepine treatment of rat cerebellar granule cells induced a transient down-regulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor alpha 1 subunit protein, that was dose-dependent (1 nM-1 microM) and prevented by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (1 microM). After 2 days of treatment with 1 microM flunitrazepam the alpha 1 subunit protein was reduced by 41% compared to untreated cells, which returned to, and remained at, control cell levels from 4-12 days of treatment. Chronic flunitrazepam treatment did not significantly alter the GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit protein over the 2-12 day period. 2. GABA treatment for 2 days down-regulates the alpha 1 subunit protein in a dose-dependent (10 microM-1 mM) manner that was prevented by the selective GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 microM). At 10 microM and 1 mM GABA the reduction in alpha 1 subunit expression compared to controls was 31% and 66%, respectively. 3. The flunitrazepam-induced decrease in alpha 1 subunit protein is independent of GABA, which suggests that it involves a mechanism distinct from the GABA-dependent action of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptor channel activity. 4. Simultaneous treatment with flunitrazepam and GABA did not produce an additive down-regulation of alpha 1 subunit protein, but produced an effect of the same magnitude as that of flunitrazepam alone. This down-regulation induced by the combination of flunitrazepam and GABA was inhibited by flumazenil (78%), but unaffected by bicuculline. 5. The flunitrazepam-induced down-regulation of alpha 1 subunit protein at 2 days was completely reversed by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (0.3 microM). 6. This study has shown that both flunitrazepam and GABA treatment, via their respective binding sites, caused a reduction in the expression of the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit protein; an effect mediated through the same neurochemical mechanism. The results also imply that the benzodiazepine effect is independent of GABA, and that the benzodiazepine and GABA sites may not be equally coupled to the down-regulation process, with the benzodiazepine site being the more dominant. The biochemical mechanism underlying the benzodiazepine-mediated down-regulation of the alpha 1 subunit protein seems to involve the activity of staurosporine-sensitive protein kinases.", 
    "132": "Epileptic seizures are the most common neurologic problem of the dog. The ability of a clinician to start proper management does not require elaborate equipment or specialized skills. What is needed is a thorough assessment of the history and examination findings. Dogs with a history of seizures at less than 1 or greater than 7 years of age, a history of behavioral changes, an initial interictal interval of less than 4 weeks, or an initial partial seizure should be suspected of having an identifiable underlying cause for the seizures. As such, an appropriate diagnostic evaluation should be done. Once a cause has been determined, PB is the AED of choice for dogs without underlying liver disease. Factors that enhance successful PB therapy are early initiation of therapy and proper monitoring of trough serum concentrations. Dogs that develop functional tolerance to PB should be given oral potassium bromide as the second AED. Diazepam per rectum can be used as an at-home therapy to stop cluster seizure activity. Overall, improved seizure control can be achieved by establishing a well-thought out therapeutic monitoring schedule. This approach will lead to improved quality of life for the patient, resulting in greater client satisfaction and less clinician frustration.", 
    "133": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a potent stimulus of pancreatic enzyme secretion and growth and is known to influence the flow of biliary secretions. It has also been suggested as a trophic stimulus of the biliary tract and liver, but confirmatory studies are lacking. The aim of the present experiment was to study the effects on the rat liver and biliary tract of long-term stimulation of CCK-8S and the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide, respectively. Sprague-Dawley male rats had an infusion of sulfated CCK-8, devazepide or sodium chloride by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. The animals were sacrified 36 h and 3, 7 or 28 days after the start of infusion, and all had an injection of tritiated thymidine (1 mCi/kg) intraperitoneally 1 h prior to death. The liver was dissected out, weighed and processed for its content of protein, DNA and water. After autoradiography, histologic samples were examined for labeled hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium. Devazepide caused an increase in liver protein content from 36 h on. After 3 days labeling index of hepatocytes and liver DNA concentration were increased. On day 7, induced cell proliferation was also seen in the bile duct epithelium, and the increase in liver DNA content and concentration was now more pronounced and persisted throughout the study. After 28 days devazepide also induced increased crude and relative liver weight. A transient reduction in liver weight and liver protein content and concentration was seen after 7 days of CCK-8S infusion. There were no changes of the labeling index of hepatocytes or bile duct epithelial cells or in liver DNA content in the rats receiving CCK-8S infusion. Devazepide induced hyperplastic changes in both the liver and the biliary tract, probably by interfering with the bile secretion, whereas CCK-8S did not exert any similar effects. The results do not support CCK as a hepatotrophic factor.", 
    "134": "A systematic study of formulation factors influencing the release of clonazepam from hydrophilic ointment bases was performed. Diffusion experiments were carried out using both artificial membranes (cellulose nitrate membrane impregnated with lauryl alcohol or isopropylmiristate or vaseline oil) and natural ones (rabbit ear skin). The formulation variables were the percentage of polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 6000 and water, and the type of lipophilic component (lauryl alcohol, isopropylmyristate or vaseline oil) added to the vehicle. In vitro and ex vivo results were compared and the best formulation was found, even if it was not possible to establish a precise correlation between the in vitro and ex vivo flux values."
