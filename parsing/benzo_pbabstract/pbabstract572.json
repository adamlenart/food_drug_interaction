    "0": "Side effects involving agitation, e.g., sleepwalking, anger, and panic, were observed in 10 insomniac patients treated with temazepam or triazolam but not other benzodiazepines. Each patient described these side effects as uncharacteristic. Milder agitation was observed in 2 cases. In 4 cases, these effects were doubted by the prescribing physician. This type of side effect has been only slowly recognized for other benzodiazepines and has not been much reported for these newer agents. Agitation observed during treatment with these agents may be related to their short elimination half-lives.", 
    "1": "Changes in the uptake of various neurotransmitters were measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of male and female rats that were exposed to diazepam through the placenta or through the mother's milk during the prenatal or early postnatal period of rapid brain development. Earlier studies from our laboratory showed that early diazepam exposure has long-lasting behavioral consequences. The present results show that prenatally diazepam-exposed rat pups show significant reduction in choline uptake in the frontal cortex at 10 days of age. At 60 days of age, both pre- and postnatally exposed males, but not females, show significant differences from controls in terms of choline uptake, whereas postnatally exposed females whose behavior was shown previously to be profoundly affected by the diazepam exposure showed significant increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake in the hippocampus and reduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) uptake in the cortex at 60 days of age.", 
    "2": "The effects of muscimol and/or incubation temperature on the inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam receptor binding by benzodiazepine receptor ligands were investigated. At 0 degree C muscimol decreased the Ki values for some ligands as displacers of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to brain-specific sites while increasing or having no effect on the Ki values for other ligands. The Ki values for some ligands are higher at 37 degrees C than at 0 degree C but are reduced by muscimol at both 0 degrees and 37 degrees C. In contrast, the ligands whose Ki values are increased by muscimol either decreased or did not alter the Ki values at 37 degrees C as compared to those at 0 degree C. Incubation of membranes at 37 degrees C for 30 min accelerated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release by 221% over that at 0 degree C. These results indicate that changes in incubation temperature alter benzodiazepine receptor affinity for ligands via GABA.", 
    "3": "Intravenous ketamine dissociation anesthesia combined with epinephrine solution infiltration may provoke serious tachyarrhythmias despite diazepam premedication and the use of minimal doses of both drugs. We use a dose of 0.5 mg of ketamine per kilogram of body weight to induce a short period of amnesia and analgesia, which enables us to infiltrate the operative field with lidocaine and epinephrine solution in a 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 concentration. In about 20% of the patients we encountered significant transient tachycardia and elevation of blood pressure, which required no treatment; however, in 2 of our patients, serious arrhythmias occurred that required drug conversions. Such a problem was not encountered with the use of epinephrine alone in patients without a predisposing condition, nor when ketamine in these small doses was used in other large series.", 
    "4": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against a gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex (GABAA/BZR) were produced by using spleen cells from a mouse immunized with GABAA/BZR purified from bovine cerebral cortex. The mAb, most of which were of the IgG1 isotype could be divided into four groups (I-IV) specifying different antigenic structures. On immunoblots, group I mAb recognized exclusively the Mr 55,000 beta-subunit, while groups II and IV mAb recognized the Mr 50,000 alpha-subunit of bovine GABAA/BZR. Three of the four groups of mAb (I, III, and IV) crossreacted with both human and rat GABAA/BZR with the same subunit specificity as in bovine brain; the fourth group (II) crossreacted with human but not with the rat receptor. The binding sites for benzodiazepines as well as the high and low affinity GABA sites reside on the same structural complex as shown by immunoprecipitation. Ligand binding to these sites was not inhibited by mAb. Since quantitative immunoprecipitation of GABAA/BZR was achieved with mAb selective for either the alpha- or beta-subunit, both subunits occur in each individual receptor complex. The pattern of immunoblot staining suggests that the smaller alpha-subunit is not a processing product of the larger beta-subunit. Both alpha- and beta-subunits were present in all brain areas and species tested (rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus; bovine cerebral cortex and cerebellum; human cerebral cortex). This suggests a uniform subunit composition of the receptor throughout the brain in contrast to earlier evidence for a heterogeneous subunit composition based on photoaffinity labeling.", 
    "5": "The effects of clinically used anticonvulsant drugs on high-frequency sustained repetitive firing (SRF) of action potentials and on postsynaptic responses to iontophoretically applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been compared to establish a classification of anticonvulsant drugs based on cellular mechanisms of action. By using concentrations in the range of therapeutic cerebrospinal fluid values in humans, drugs have been separated into three categories: Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid limited SRF, but did not alter GABA responses. Phenobarbital, clonazepam, and diazepam augmented GABA responses and limited SRF only at concentrations above the therapeutic range in ambulatory patients but that are achieved in the acute treatment of status epilepticus. Ethosuximide failed to affect SRF or GABA responses even at supratherapeutic concentrations. Ability of an anticonvulsant to limit SRF correlated well with efficacy against generalized tonic-clonic seizures clinically and against maximal electroshock seizures in experimental animals. Augmentation of GABA responses and lack of limitation of SRF correlated with efficacy against generalized absence seizures in humans and against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in animals. However, ethosuximide must act against generalized absence seizures and against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures by a third, as yet unknown, mechanism. Other actions occurring at supratherapeutic concentrations correlated with clinical toxicity.", 
    "6": "The 8-carbon chain analogue of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), omega-aminocaprylic acid (omega-AC), was administered to single cortical neurones of rat by microiontophoresis and its effect on cell firing compared to the effect elicited by GABA. The spontaneous and glutamate-elicited firing rates of all cells examined were decreased by omega-AC, the molecule having an apparent potency approximately one-fifth that of GABA. Inhibitions induced by omega-AC were antagonized by bicuculline and enhanced by flurazepam. These data favour the view that extending chain length per se of the GABA molecule decreases the inhibitory potency of postsynaptic GABA receptor agonists. The results do not support the view that such structural changes alter the mode of action of GABA analogues, from inhibition to excitation, as has been suggested previously.", 
    "7": "The present study was undertaken to investigate whether benzodiazepine receptors are involved in either the anticonvulsant activity of phenytoin against supramaximal seizures or maximal threshold seizures induced by electroshock or the neurotoxicity of phenytoin. Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, reversed the anticonvulsant activity of clonazepam against both supramaximal and maximal threshold seizures induced by electroshock but not that of phenytoin. Moreover, Ro 15-1788 did not decrease the neurotoxicity of phenytoin. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors are not involved in either the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin against seizures induced by electroshock or the neurotoxicity of phenytoin.", 
    "8": "Possible mechanisms of action of carbamazepine and diazepam on amygdala-kindled seizures were studied using compounds acting at the central and \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine binding sites. Ro-15-1788, a selective antagonist at the central benzodiazepine site, blocked the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam, but not of carbamazepine. In contrast, Ro5-4864, which acts at the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine site, blocked the anticonvulsant effect of carbamazepine, but not of diazepam. The effect of Ro5-4864 was itself reversed by PK-11195, a compound that displaces Ro5-4864 binding in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine and diazepam on amygdala-kindled seizures are differentially mediated and suggest that the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine binding site is functionally involved in the anticonvulsant effect of carbamazepine.", 
    "9": "Dose-response curves for the convulsant effect of isoniazid were determined in male rats. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, at doses from 20 to 100 mg/kg i.v. or at 300 mg/kg p.o., failed to produce any relevant shift of the isoniazid dose-response curves to the left (proconvulsant) or to the right (anticonvulsant). In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor ligand ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) 10 mg/kg i.v. produced a clear-cut shift to the left of the isoniazid dose-response curve. Ro 15-1788 was inactive up to high p.o. or i.v. doses, versus convulsions induced by a low supraliminal dose of isoniazid, whereas beta-CCE had a significant proconvulsant effect beginning at 5 mg/kg i.v. This effect of beta-CCE was dose dependently antagonized by Ro 15-1788. In conclusion, in the present experimental conditions Ro 15-1788 showed no inverse agonistic properties at benzodiazepine receptors, in contrast to beta-CCE.", 
    "10": "Benzodiazepines (BZD) have been reported to suppress cholecystokinin-8S (CCK-8S)-induced activation. PK 8165, a ligand of BZD receptors, is an anxiolytic devoid of sedative and anticonvulsant effects. PK 8165, applied microiontophoretically or administered i.v. at low doses, suppressed CCK-8S-induced activation of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whereas, at high doses it antagonized the effect of microiontophoretic applications of flurazepam. These results indicate that PK 8165 acts as a mixed agonist-antagonist at BZD receptors and suggest that the suppression of CCK-8S-induced activation by BZD might be related to their anxiolytic property rather than to their sedative or anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "11": "The iminodibenzyl antipsychotic drugs, clocapramine, carpipramine and Y-516 were studied in order to elucidate their mechanisms of action. They all accelerated the accumulation of the dopamine (DA) metabolites, homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the rat brain. Only Y-516 antagonized in vivo the apomorphine-induced inhibition of DA synthesis as estimated from the accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the decarboxylase-inhibited rat striatum after cessation of nerve impulse flow. All three drugs showed high affinity for DA receptors labelled by [3H]haloperidol and [3H]ADTN in the rat striatum in vitro, with the order of potency Y-516 greater than clocapramine greater than carpipramine. All accelerated the accumulation of the norepinephrine metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), in mouse brain. They showed high affinity for alpha 1-adrenoceptors labelled by [3H]WB 4101 and for alpha 2-adrenoceptors labelled by [3H]clonidine in the rat cerebral cortex in vitro. Although they all had the same level of affinity for the alpha 1-adrenoceptors, Y-516 had less affinity for the alpha 2-adrenoceptors than did clocapramine and carpipramine. The above results indicate that these drugs are potent DA antagonists which block alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the brain.", 
    "12": "Behavioural, biochemical and neurophysiological evidence suggests that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may play an important role in the neural control of circadian rhythms. Central receptors for benzodiazepines are functionally coupled to GABA receptors and appear to mediate behavioural effects of exogenous benzodiazepines. The binding of 3H-flunitrazepam to synaptic plasma membranes prepared from various regions of rat brain was examined at 6-hour intervals over a 36-hour period. Prominent daily rhythms in receptor number (Bmax) were observed in the frontal lobe and the cerebellum but not in the temporoparietal regions, hypothalamus or medulla/pons. Binding was highest during periods of sleep/low activity with a significant decrease occurring just prior to waking. These results suggest that daily fluctuations in benzodiazepine receptor numbers may be related to the temporal control of sleep/wake and muscle activity cycles.", 
    "13": "Diazepam increased the acetylcholine content in the striatum and the hippocampus of the rat. This effect was antagonized in both brain areas by treatment with the specific central benzodiazepine blockers ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and Ro 15-1788, whereas the peripheral antagonist Ro 5-4864 was ineffective. Pretreatment with picrotoxin, a known GABA antagonist did not interfere with the diazepam-induced acetylcholine increase. These results indicate a specific involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in the cholinergic action of diazepam and this effect appears to be independent of GABA receptor activation.", 
    "14": "The binding of oxazepam and its glucuronide conjugates to human serum albumin (HSA), as well as the binding interactions of the drug and its metabolites, were examined by equilibrium dialysis and kinetic probe studies. Oxazepam and its S(+) glucuronide are bound to the HSA molecule with affinity constants of 3.5 X 10(5) M-1 and 5.5 X 10(4) M-1, respectively, which were independent of protein concentration over a range of 0.1 to 5.0 g/dl. The R(-) glucuronide bound weakly to albumin, with the binding parameter, N X K, increasing at lower albumin concentrations. Pre-acetylation of fatty acid free-HSA resulted in decreased binding of all three compounds, probably by altering the conformation of the binding sites. Kinetic probe studies with p-nitrophenyl acetate indicate that oxazepam and its S(+) glucuronide shared a common binding site on HSA, but that the R(-) glucuronide bound at another site. Oxazepam binding was unaffected by the presence of its glucuronide conjugates but was inhibited by fatty acids. The percentage of oxazepam bound to plasma proteins in patients with renal impairment (94%) was lower than in normal volunteers (97%). This lower binding can neither be attributed to lower albumin concentrations because of the large binding capacity of the protein and linearity of N X K nor to displacement by elevated concentrations of glucuronide conjugates, but it may be ascribed partly to increased plasma fatty acids.", 
    "15": "A simple, sensitive, selective and precise liquid-column chromatographic assay for clonazepam is described, in which 1 ml of serum containing 50 micrograms/l methylclonazepam as an internal standard is extracted by elution from a Bond-Elut column with 400 microliter of methanol. An aliquot of the eluate is injected on to a reversed-phase column and eluted with a mobile phase of acetonitrile--phosphate buffer (30:70) at a flow-rate of 2 ml/min at a column temperature of 50 degrees C. Detection is at 254 nm. Chromatography is complete in 12 min. A sensitivity of 2 ng/ml is attained when 1 ml of serum is extracted. Analytical recovery of the clonazepam added to serum ranged from 91% to 99% with a coefficient of variation of 6.0%. This assay for clonazepam has good precision, with coefficients of variation of 11% at 15 ng/ml and 2.6% at 50 ng/ml. There was no interference from any of the commonly used antiepileptics.", 
    "16": "It is reported that benzodiazepines such as diazepam will stimulate the opiate receptor system and that B-carboline drugs, which are benzodiazepine antagonists, may interact with opiate receptors directly. The ability of 3-hydroxymethyl-B-carboline (3-HMC) to antagonize several parameters of fentanyl anesthesia was tested here in rats. Fentanyl (25 and 100 micrograms/kg iv) produced dose dependent depression of cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured by radioactive microspheres, and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2). These effects were significantly inhibited by 10 mg/kg 3-HMC iv. To test for the specificity of this effect, 3-HMC was also given to rats ventilated with inspire concentrations of 2% halothane. Halothane depressed CMRO2 equally in 3-HMC and vehicle treated rats, indicating no significant effect of the benzodiazepine antagonist. Blood pressure was increased in 3-HMC compared to vehicle treated animals during both fentanyl and halothane anesthesia. CBF was increased in 3-HMC vs vehicle treated rats during halothane anesthesia but this could be accounted for by the elevated blood pressure and lack of cerebral autoregulation rather than a direct cerebrovascular effect. 3-HMC decreased the sleep time and respiratory depressant effects of fentanyl but enhanced the analgesic effects of the opiate, as measured by time to respond to a hot plate stimulus. These results indicate that 3-HMC has the ability to specifically antagonize fentanyl anesthesia. These effects may be produced by an action of 3-HMC at the benzodiazepine receptor and/or by an action of the B-carboline at opioid receptors.", 
    "17": "Benzodiazepine receptor [( 3H]flunitrazepam) binding and purine concentration were measured in autopsied cerebral cortex of 4 patients who died with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Receptor density was normal in all 4 regions of Lesch-Nyhan cortex examined. However, an enhancement of benzodiazepine receptor affinity (25% reduction in Kd) was found in well-washed parietal and occipital cortex homogenates. Maximal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was normal in temporal, parietal and occipital cortex but markedly reduced (by 50-80%) in frontal cortex. Increased sensitivity to hypoxanthine inhibition (30% reduction in Ki) was also observed in parietal cortex. The concentrations of the purines hypoxanthine, xanthine and inosine in Lesch-Nyhan parietal cortex were about twice the values measured in control material matched for postmortem time. We suggest that the above-normal concentrations of purines estimated to be present in Lesch-Nyhan brain may be sufficient to significantly affect the ability of the benzodiazepine receptor to modulate GABA-mediated brain mechanisms.", 
    "18": "Rat hippocampus membranes were treated with several protein modifying reagents (iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, tetranitromethane and N-acetylimidazole). The effects of these treatments on the binding sites of cyclopyrrolones ([3H] suriclone), a new chemical family of minor tranquilizers, and benzodiazepines ([3H] flunitrazepam) were investigated. Here we show that both ligands are similarly sensitive to cysteine alkylation: [3H] suriclone and [3H] flunitrazepam binding are reduced by iodoacetamide and slightly increased by N-ethylmaleimide. On the contrary they are clearly differenciated by tyrosine modification: [3H] suriclone binding is not changed whereas [3H] flunitrazepam binding is increased by tetranitromethane and decreased by N-acetylimidazole. Our present findings and published evidence suggest cyclopyrrolones and benzodiazepines bind to distinct sites or to different allosteric forms of the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "19": "The new antisecretory drug, telenzepine (4,9-dihydro-3-methyl-4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)acetyl]-10H-thieno-[3,4 - b][1,5]benzodiazepin-10-one), was investigated for its inhibition of functionally intact muscarinic receptors involved in gastric acid secretion in rabbit fundic glands, perfused mouse stomach in vitro, perfused rat stomach in situ, gastric fistula in rats and dogs with a Heidenhain pouch. The effects on these receptors were contrasted with effects on receptors located on smooth muscle and heart, i.e. isolated rat urinary bladder, stomach and atrium. The results were compared to those values obtained with nonselective antimuscarinic drugs (N-methylscopolamine, atropine) and the selective M-1 antagonist pirenzepine. Telenzepine was found to be 4-10 times more potent than pirenzepine with respect to depressing both gastric acid secretion and smooth muscle or myocardial responses. Based on -log EC50 and pA2 values, both drugs exhibited a similar selectivity profile differing from the pattern of effects observed with atropine or a second reference compound, zolenzepine. As compared with atropine, telenzepine exhibited a 5 fold higher relative affinity to muscarinic receptors involved in gastric acid secretion. It was concluded that telenzepine is selective to discriminate between muscarinic receptors mediating gastric acid secretion and affecting muscle contractility and that this finding supports the concept of muscarinic receptor heterogeneity.", 
    "20": "In a controlled clinical trial, the efficacy of an intravenous combination of cimetidine and pirenzepine (group A: 62 patients) was compared with that of an intragastric administration of a magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide concentrate (group B: 58 patients) in preventing visible and occult upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in intensive-care patients. It was found that both forms of therapy had the same favourable effect on the extent and incidence rate of visible and occult gastric bleeding. The antacid was more effective than the cimetidine-pirenzepine combination in raising the pH level to 4 or higher (P less than 0.05). Intensive-care patients should, therefore, be treated with the antacid whenever possible, since it is equally effective as the cimetidine-pirenzepine combination in preventing bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, whereas it is superior in elevating the gastric pH. Besides, the use of the antacid is also less costly.", 
    "21": "In the rat substantia nigra Type II benzodiazepine recognition sites (measured as the portion of [3H]flunitrazepam binding which remain after the addition of 2 X 10(-7) M Cl 218872) represent 50% of the total benzodiazepine recognition sites. The density of Type II sites was increased by 35% following the degeneration of the striatonigral afferents induced by the intrastriatal injection of kainic acid. On the other hand the same lesion failed to change the density of the remaining nigral Type I sites. The results indicate that denervation induces supersensitivity to nigral Type II benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "22": "PK 11195, an antagonist of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, in doses from 5 to 25 mg/kg i.d. protected in a dose-dependent manner dogs against both early and delayed ventricular arrhythmias induced by 20 min ischemia and against ventricular fibrillation following reperfusion. Thus, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors might represent a novel target in the treatment of angina and cardiac ischemia.", 
    "23": "Maternal behavior (pup retrieval) was assessed in prenatally stressed rats during control and conflict situations (having to pass through an airstream) when their pups were 4-5 days old. There was no difference in pup retrieval between experimental and control rats under normal conditions but only 52% of the former retrieved their pups during the conflict situation, compared with 96% of the controls. Catecholamine (CA) levels in the arcuate nucleus (Arc.n.) and noradrenaline in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) were not altered in prenatally stressed females, but their dopamine levels in the POM tended to be lower (p less than 0.1). The number of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in the hippocampi of prenatally stressed females was significantly lower than in controls. We conclude from these results that random prenatal noise and light stress increases the vulnerability to stressful situations in the female offspring during adulthood, which may be accompanied by altered CA function in the hypothalamus and BZ binding in the hippocampus.", 
    "24": "Sexual behavior dysfunction unaccompanied by detectable physical or endocrine abnormality is an important cause of reproductive failure among domestic stallions. Several authors have suggested that such dysfunction may be psychogenic, related to negative experience associated with intense handling and training. An experimental model of experience-related dysfunction was developed by exposing pony stallions to erection-contingent aversive conditioning. This resulted in rapid, specific suppression of sexual arousal and response similar to spontaneously occurring dysfunction. Subsequently, treatment with a CNS-active benzodiazepine derivative (diazepam) reversed these effects.", 
    "25": "The present study was designed to evaluate the haemodynamic effects of flunitrazepam used for sedation in the post operative period after abdominal or orthopedic surgery. Patients with coronary artery disease (C.A.D.) were divided in two groups; in group II stable cardiac failure was present. Results did not show any significant haemodynamic changes after flunitrazepam in both groups. Flunitrazepam is a haemodynamic secure and valuable agent for sedation during recovery for patients with C.A.D. even in stable cardiac failure.", 
    "26": "There currently is no pharmacologic approach to the problem of anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV). Lorazepam (Ativan, Wyeth Laboratories, Philadelphia) is an interesting candidate drug if it could block the recall of the unpleasant events associated with chemotherapy, especially if it also has antiemetic properties. Since ANV is a conditioned (learned) response, it may well depend on a memory imprint of the stimulus. This pilot study was designed to use intravenous lorazepam given before and after cisplatin infusion in 32 patients, and to make detailed measurements of nausea, vomiting, recent memory, anxiety, and sedation as well as toxicity. Satisfactory responses occurred in about 70%, as rated separately both by investigator and patient. Forty-six percent did not even recall receiving chemotherapy, regardless of whether or not they vomited; 80% had no significant anxiety after chemotherapy. Adverse reactions included some cases of perceptual disturbance, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, hypotension, and one case of severe transient amnesia. No long-term adverse effects were noted.", 
    "27": "Two novel, specific inhibitors of GABA uptake, namely SKF 89976-A (N-[4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl]-nipecotic acid) and SKF 100330-A (N-[4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl]-guvacine) were tested for anticonvulsant effects in amygdaloid kindled female rats. The anticonvulsant effectiveness of the compounds was compared with that of diazepam. SKF 89976-A and SKF 100330-A produced dose-dependent anticonvulsant effects on all seizure parameters measured in fully kindled rats, i.e. they inhibited seizure severity, increased seizure latency, and decreased the duration of motor seizures and EEG after discharges. ED 50s for inhibition of seizure severity were 4.6 and 15.1 mg/kg (0.014 and 0.045 mmol/kg) i.p. for SKF 100330-A and SKF 89976-A, respectively. For comparison, the ED 50 of diazepam was 1.9 mg/kg (0.0067 mmol/kg) i.p. Observation of behaviour indicated that the novel GABA uptake blockers exerted no side-effects in anticonvulsant doses, whereas diazepam produced sedative effects at all active dosage levels. The data demonstrate that SKF 100330-A and SKF 89976-A are potent, non-sedative anticonvulsant drugs in the kindling model of epilepsy, and these compounds thus may deserve interest as potential antiepileptic drugs with a very selective mechanism of action.", 
    "28": "The synthesis of 5H-imidazo [2,1-c] [1,4] benzodiazepine derivatives is described. Hydroxymethylation of 1-(2-nitrobenzyl)imidazoles by reaction with formaldehyde in a sealed tube and subsequent oxidation of hydroxymethylimidazoles with activated manganese dioxide afforded 1-(2-nitrobenzyl)imidazole-2-carboxaldehydes. The latter compounds were treated with iron(II) sulphate to yield directly the expected tricyclic imidazobenzodiazepines by intramolecular cyclization of the intermediates aminoaldehydes. The tricyclic derivatives were subjected to pharmacological screening to evaluate the effects on the behavior of the animals and the interaction with some biogenic amines. Some of the tested compounds were comparable to chlordiazepoxide in sedative and muscle-relaxant activities. None of them showed antiserotonin, anticholinergic or adrenolytic activities.", 
    "29": "The dose-response effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 1-methylisoguanosine (MIG) on sleep in rats were examined. Not even the largest dose (100 nmol/rat) of 1-methylisoguanosine produced significant hypnotic effects, whereas doses of 10 and 100 nmol/rat suppressed rapid eye movement sleep in rats. The only statistically significant effect of 1-methylisoguanosine on sleep latencies was an increase in the latency of S2 after intracerebroventricular administration of 100 nmol/rat of the drug. These effects of 1-methylisoguanosine on sleep were unlike those of both adenosine and the benzodiazepines, suggesting that, contrary to earlier speculations, 1-methylisoguanosine does not interact with central adenosine or benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "30": "Ketamine, ketamine-xylazine, and ketamine-diazepam were evaluated clinically in 15 ferrets, and safe dosage was determined for each. All of the three regimens provided excellent immobilization. However, muscle rigidity and incomplete analgesia were noted in ketamine alone and in ketamine-diazepam respectively. It was concluded that 25 mg/kg ketamine and 2 mg/kg xylazine intramuscularly provided acceptable analgesia, muscle relaxation, duration and smooth recovery, although cardiac arrhythmias were a concern and require careful observation.", 
    "31": "The technique of intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) has failed to gain general acceptance among anaesthetists, who are divided into those who never use it, preferring more specific local anaesthetic blocks, and those who would recommend it as the technique of choice for some procedures. Numerous large series have been published, attesting to its general safety, but intermittent accounts of serious side effects and more recent reports of fatalities have called the technique into question, so that a reassessment seems timely.", 
    "32": "The fate of 75Se-labelled schistosomula in mice treated at 24 h post-infection with either Ro 11-3128 or oxamniquine, compared to untreated controls, was followed by compressed organ autoradiography. No difference in the total percentage of schistosomula detected as foci was found between the three groups at each sampling time. However, the distribution of schistosomula was altered. In oxamniquine-treated mice there was a delayed migration from the skin relative to controls and fewer parasites in total appeared to reach the lungs. In Ro 11-3128 treated mice very few parasites left the skin. Ro 11-3128 treatment induces resistance to challenge whereas oxamniquine does not. The fate of challenge schistosomula in previously infected Ro 11-3128 treated mice was also compared to that in control mice. There was evidence for delayed or reduced migration from the skin of Ro 11-3128 treated mice. Significant death of challenge parasites occurred in the lungs, or post-lung sites in both control and treated mice. It was not possible to conclude that any of the late attrition was immune-dependent in the treated mice and the results appeared to indicate that a significant fraction of parasite death occurred at the skin stage.", 
    "33": "Although special residency programs preparing internists for primary care have been in existence for a decade, little is known about whether these tracks have achieved their goals. As part of a multicenter evaluation of ambulatory care at four university hospitals, 1,040 patient care encounters were reviewed for 16 primary-care and 41 traditional medicine residents. Using a chart-based audit, the authors examined 16 discrete items of patient care to assess resident management in the following areas: screening for colorectal carcinoma, management of hypertension, benzodiazepine drug prescribing, and management of chronic lung disease. Their hypothesis that primary care residents would score higher than traditional medicine residents in the areas of screening, prevention, and prescribing of drugs was not supported. There was no association between type of training and performance of a task with the following exception: second-year primary care residents screened for colorectal carcinoma in 86% (126) of patients whose charts were audited, while second-year traditional medicine residents did so in 77% (160) (P less than 0.025). This difference was not maintained when the residents were reaudited 1 year later. Both groups of residents scored high in all areas with the following exceptions: documentation of the amount of sedative dispensed and immunization of susceptible patients against pneumococcus and influenza. The ambulatory practices of both groups of residents exceeded expectations, probably because of the wider influence of primary care training.", 
    "34": "Diazepam 1 mg/kg body weight was administered rectally to 14 children (11-22.5 kg) before minor surgery under general anaesthesia. Administration in solution (n = 7) resulted in a rapid increase in serum concentrations which were maintained for 8 h. Administration by suppository (n = 7) resulted in significantly lower serum concentrations at 10 and 20 min, but higher concentrations at 2 h. At other intervals the concentrations did not differ from those reached after administration of diazepam in rectal solution. These results favour for use of a solution when rectal diazepam is used for premedication in children.", 
    "35": "The prescribing patterns for hypnotic medications were surveyed in 765 patients of three skilled-nursing facilities and two intermediate-care facilities. Seven per cent of the patients received a hypnotic routinely; an additional 3 per cent had as-needed orders for a hypnotic medication. Temazepam, flurazepam, and triazolam were, in descending order, the three most commonly prescribed hypnotics and accounted for 79 per cent of the hypnotic prescriptions. The average duration of use for triazolam, temazepam, and flurazepam was 11 weeks, 24 weeks, and 82 weeks, respectively. Seventy-six per cent of the flurazepam prescriptions were given seven days a week; 31 per cent of these prescriptions were for 30 mg doses. Medications that were not hypnotics but did have sedative side-effects were prescribed with bedtime orders for 11 per cent of the patients. The three most commonly prescribed drugs in this class were diphenhydramine, thioridazine, and haloperidol. Possible explanations for the lower frequency of hypnotic use observed in this study as compared to the frequencies reported in the literature are discussed, as are possible hazards of high-dose and long-term use of hypnotics.", 
    "36": "The paper discusses the importance and implications of the event-related-potentials in the analysis of effects of centrally acting drugs. This is illustrated using a study on the influence of diazepam and caffeine on the contingent-negative-variation (CNV) as an example. Special emphasis is placed on methodological problems and their possible solutions. A linear robust fitting technique was used for quantification of the slow-rising, ramp-like CNV potentials as an alternative to conventional baseline-to-peak measures. Results obtained by this method were validated by a second analysis taking slow superimposed DC-shifts into account. This was achieved by defining a reference line from the data for CNV-development and -resolution. The possibilities of single-trial potential evaluation were explored by using a pattern recognition algorithm. The average CNV-waveform was used as a reference-signal to which the single-trial potentials were correlated. Since pattern recognition techniques are sensitive to morphological changes of the potentials they are adding a new aspect to event-related-potential analysis.", 
    "37": "The following drugs, mostly postulated acting at a supraspinal or spinal level as diazepam, chlormezanone and orphenadrine citrate were proved for their effectiveness in lessening tension of muscles. This was assessed by electromyography recording different neurophysiological phenomenons as mono- and polysynaptic reflex responses (H-reflex and unloading reflex as a result of a suddenly muscle relaxation (= post-reflex inhibition phase/silent period) and tiredness reaction. This investigations were performed on at least 65 patients. The outcomes are: statistical significant increase of the silent period of the unloading reflex under the treatment with diazepam and orphenadrine citrate. Diazepam also extended the time between the initial electric stimulus and H-reflex phenomenon. Evaluating these results it might be obvious that diazepam is acting on supraspinal level and the spinal too, orphenadrine citrate only on the supraspinal one. Chlormezanone showed no effect according to that protocol on all mentioned neurophysiological parameters.", 
    "38": "A retrospective survey on 66 adults with epilepsy who received multiple drug therapy after the failure of single drugs showed: a reduction of seizure frequency of 75% or more in 16.5%, no change in 67% and an increase in seizure frequency of 100% or more in 16.5%. Multiple drug therapy is of limited value in severe epilepsies.", 
    "39": "The time course of sorption of diazepam and nitroglycerin from aqueous solutions into plastic materials has been represented by the diffusion and compartmental models for a variety of storage conditions. The diffusion model seemed to be the more satisfactory model in respect to both description and prediction of the drug uptake for all conditions. The compartment model appeared to be useful for describing the drug uptake at earlier times, giving a satisfactory fit to the data and reliable final parameter estimates. However, that model was not able to describe the loss as equilibrium was approached or accurately predict the disappearance profiles for these solutes with alterations in solution volume or infusion bag size. Approximations of the diffusion model gave parameter estimates consistent with those obtained by nonlinear regression using the full equations.", 
    "40": "Of 230 adults admitted for self poisoning over two months, 153 (67%) had previously been taking a total of 309 prescribed drugs. Of these patients, 119 (78%) had been given psychotropic drugs (usually benzodiazepines), 81 (53%) obtained them on repeat prescription, and 47 (31%) had been prescribed multiple psychotropic drugs, often in seemingly illogical combinations. The use of these drugs increased progressively with age and most patients took the same drugs in overdosage as they had been prescribed. Psychotropic drugs were prescribed for more than a third of patients with no psychiatric illness and a normal personality, nearly half of those with existing alcohol or drug abuse problems, and for most of the unemployed. Fewer than a third of the patients suffering from depression were prescribed antidepressants but half had been given benzodiazepines and other potentially depressing drugs. Psychotropic drug use, psychotropic polypharmacy, and the repeat prescribing of these drugs were strongly associated with repeated overdosage and, under certain circumstances, with personality disorder, alcohol or drug abuse, unemployment, and conflict with the law. In the long term psychotropic drugs are unlikely to benefit most self poisoners, and they may do positive harm by inducing apathy and depression and predisposing to self poisoning. The incidence of self poisoning (and repeat overdosage in particular) might be reduced by more care and restraint in the prescribing of these drugs.", 
    "41": "Althesin and delta 16-alphaxalone have been used alone and in combination with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 to investigate any protective effect these drugs might have against bicuculline-induced convulsions in rats. We found that Althesin provided good protection against bicuculline-induced convulsions which was enhanced when Ro 15-1788 was also present. delta 16-Alphaxalone lacks the anaesthetic properties of Althesin, but did have some activity in preventing bicuculline-induced convulsions, although it was less effective than Althesin. Its action was not enhanced by treatment with Ro 15-1788. Although we have no definitive explanation of these results, it is possible that when Ro 15-1788 is used clinically, it may interact with other drugs not related chemically to the benzodiazepines.", 
    "42": "Oral diazepam is commonly used as a premedicant. For a given dose there is considerable between patient variation in clinical effect and plasma levels. The addition of droperidol may improve consistency and contribute antiemesis whilst avoiding the undesirable effects of droperidol alone. Ninety patients undergoing minor gynecological or minor urological surgery were given as an oral premedicant either diazepam (0.185 mg/kg) or one of two combinations of diazepam and droperidol (diazepam, 0.185 mg/kg plus droperidol, 0.09 mg/kg; or diazepam, 0.135 mg/kg plus droperidol, 0.09 mg/kg). There was no significant difference between the groups in altering mean anxiety measurements or improving consistency of action as judged by the number of patients having reduced anxiety measurements. Side effects, including nausea and vomiting, were not significantly different between the three groups. In the doses used there was no practical advantage in adding droperidol to diazepam for oral premedication.", 
    "43": "The study describes a reproducible model of complete brain ischemia in rats. Rats with different plasma glucose concentrations were exposed to 10 min of complete cerebral ischemia achieved by compression of neck vessels by a pneumatic cuff. All 30 rats, except one, in which pre-ischemic plasma glucose level were lower than 22 mM (range 1.6-22) survived 10 min complete ischemia and made a similar recovery. Ten rats with pre-ischemic plasma glucose levels above 22 mM (range 22-47.2) died from seizures in the post-ischemic period. Post-ischemic treatment of seizures and hyperglycemia in the hyperglycemic rats significantly improved recovery. In conclusion, pre-ischemic hyperglycemia above 22 mM impairs recovery after complete ischemia by inducing seizures, post-ischemic hyperglycemia and lactic acidosis.", 
    "44": "One of the most perplexing and dangerous aspects of borderline personality disorder is the wide array of suicidal and parasuicidal behaviors. Close phenomenologic evaluation of these behaviors reveals that they can be differentiated into various subcategories. Approaching these behaviors with a biologic perspective may prove helpful in elucidating the underlying etiologies and therapeutic approaches.", 
    "45": "Isoniazid is an antituberculous drug that is usually administered for nine to 12 months. The potential for clinically important interactions exists because this drug is a potent inhibitor of drug metabolism. Studies and case reports have shown that isoniazid inhibits the metabolism of several drugs, including phenytoin, carbamazepine, anticoagulants, benzodiazepines, and vitamin D. Furthermore, isoniazid inhibits both monoamine oxidase and diamine oxidase (histaminase). Additional study is required to document the clinical significance of other isoniazid interactions. Future investigations will identify new isoniazid interactions.", 
    "46": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) in micromolar concentrations inhibit Mn2+- and Co2+-sensitive regenerative divalent cation potentials, which are revealed in the presence of tetraethylammonium ion, in leech nociceptive neurons (N cells). This BZ effect is reversible and dose-dependent. The BZs, like Mn2+ and Co2+, inhibit the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) and duration of divalent cation potentials at concentrations that do not significantly affect resting membrane potential or Vmax of the Na+-dependent action potential. Ultraviolet-induced BZ binding to micromolar-affinity sites in ganglia and isolated cells irreversibly blocks Ca2+ conductance in neurons without significantly affecting resting membrane potentials. BZ binding studies with leech neuronal membrane show saturable, specific binding in the micromolar concentration range that was similar to BZ binding to synaptosomal membrane fractions. The apparent Kd obtained from the micromolar-affinity BZ binding curve for leech ganglionic membrane preparations agrees well with the apparent Ki estimated from the dose-response curve measuring BZ inhibition of Vmax of the divalent cation potentials. These findings indicate that BZs act like Ca2+-channel antagonists in intact neuronal preparations and are consistent with the hypothesis that BZ binding to micromolar-affinity receptors modulates voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.", 
    "47": "The possibility of an interaction between pirenzepine, an antimuscarinic drug structurally similar to the tricyclic antidepressants, and sympathomimetic agents was investigated in a group of healthy volunteers. The effect of pirenzepine on response to intravenous tyramine was compared with that of placebo and amitriptyline. The mean dose of tyramine required to elevate systolic blood pressure by 30 mm Hg was 5.0 mg (+/- s.d. 0.8) after placebo, 5.1 mg (+/- 1.0) after pirenzepine and 11.3 mg (+/- 1.8) after amitriptyline. These results suggest that pirenzepine will not potentiate the effects of concurrently administered sympathomimetic drugs.", 
    "48": "Muscarinic receptor-mediated inositol phospholipid metabolism was examined in rat cerebral cortex and medulla-pons slices prelabelled with 3H-inositol. Carbachol stimulated accumulation of 3H-inositol phosphate in both regions with identical EC50 values though the maximal stimulation was considerably greater in cortex. The carbachol response was potently suppressed by atropine with very similar affinities in both regions. However, the M1 antagonist pirenzepine displayed a 10-fold greater affinity for the cortical carbachol response. The data supports the concept of heterogeneity of cerebral muscarinic receptors and suggests that both M1 and M2 sites may be linked to inositol phospholipid metabolism in brain.", 
    "49": "Treatment of peptic ulcer in \"non-responders\" with the combination of pirenzepine and cimetidine was evaluated in a longterm study. Patients who did not respond to two months of treatment, first with cimetidine (1 g/day), and then pirenzepine (150 mg/day), were given one of these two compounds alone for 6 months or a combination at lower doses for 24 months. The combination of pirenzepine (75 mg/day) and cimetidine (400 mg/day) was successful in a high percentage of cases, and showed fewer side effects than in the single treatment groups. The effectiveness of the combination treatment might be due to its more significant anti-secretory effects.", 
    "50": "The binding properties of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and [3H] N-methylscopolamine to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have been investigated in rat brain homogenates. The binding of both antagonists demonstrated high affinity and saturability. Analysis of the binding data resulted in linear Scatchard plots. However, (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate showed a significantly higher maximal binding capacity than that of [3H]N-methylscopolamine. Displacement of both ligands with several muscarinic receptor antagonists resulted in competition curves in accordance with the law of mass-action for quinuclidinyl benzilate, atropine and scopolamine. A similar profile was found for the quaternary ammonium analogs of atropine and scopolamine when [3H]N-methylscopolamine was used to label the receptors. However, when these hydrophilic antagonists were used to displace (-)-[3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate binding, they showed interaction with high- and low-affinity binding sites. On the other hand, the nonclassical muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, was able to displace both ligands from two binding sites. The present data are discussed in terms of the relationship of this anomalous heterogenity of binding of these hydrophilic muscarinic receptor antagonists and the proposed M1 and M2 receptor subtypes.", 
    "51": "Bronchoscopy was performed in 76 outpatients using local anaesthesia plus diazepam 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v. or midazolam 0.05 or 0.1 mg kg-1 i.v. Patient co-operation and ease of bronchoscopy were good in all patients. Two hours after injection, 67% (diazepam 0.2 mg kg-1), 36% (midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1) and 75% (midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1) of the patients failed to recall the insertion of the bronchoscope. Similarly, when asked on the following day, only 22%, 52% and 8%, respectively, of the patients remembered bronchoscopy. Two hours after sedation, the patients' performances in three psychomotor tests were similar to those measured before sedation in each group, but the patients' ability to stand steadily and walk along a straight line reverted to normal significantly (P less than 0.05) more slowly in patients receiving midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 than in the patients given diazepam. The results suggest that midazolam offers no advantage over diazepam in terms of speed of recovery of psychomotor function, when doses of similar potency are given for bronchoscopy.", 
    "52": "Astroglial cells in primary cultures bind [3H]flunitrazepam with a high affinity on a single type of site and on a number of binding sites which increased during astroglial growth and differentiation. These binding sites show a particular pharmacological spectrum characterized by an inhibition of high affinity by RO-5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam), an anticonvulsant of the benzodiazepine family and by an inhibition of binding of lower affinities by diazepam clonazepam and clobazam. RO-5-4864 and clonazepam compete for the same binding site in astroglia. The heat stability and the hormonal modulation by thyroxine are similar for astroglia and neuronal-cells. Benzodiazepines modulate the astroglial 5-HT receptor. Such an effect could be a possible physiological response to benzodiazepines for astroglial cells in primary cultures.", 
    "53": "Asymmetric differences have been found in the pre- and postsynaptic activity of the GABAergic system of the left and right striata of the rat. 3H-GABA binding shows a higher dissociation constant (KD) and a higher number of sites (Bmax) in the left striatum than in the right. Moreover, 3H-diazepam binding seems to be more extensively activated by GABA in the right striatum suggesting a more sensitive postsynaptic GABAergic activity than on the left side. However, when the presynaptic marker (GAD activity) was measured, the asymmetry was in the opposite direction. The results provide further neurochemical evidence of the functional asymmetry of the rat brain.", 
    "54": "Rats treated with a single dose of triethyl lead chloride (TEL) by subcutaneous injection (7.9 mg/kg) showed a transient increase in latencies to lick the hind paw during hot-plate testing. The time course of triethyl lead-induced antinociception was temporally associated with depressed binding capacity of benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduced levels of Substance P. Both of these changes appeared to be confined to the hippocampus and were not apparent in the cortex or striatum of treated rats. Met-enkephalin levels were not altered in any region studied at any time during the 21-day postdosing period. Lead levels within the brain were higher than blood levels 1 week after triethyl lead injection. Although changes in more than one factor may account for the antinociceptive effect of triethyl lead, the hippocampus seems especially vulnerable to this amphiphilic organometal.", 
    "55": "The effects of extracellular applications of benzodiazepine agonists and the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro15-1788, were investigated on pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. The benzodiazepine agonists, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, enhanced gamma-aminobutyrate synaptic inhibition, as tested by extracellular recordings during a paired-pulse inhibition paradigm. In contrast, Ro15-1788 (0.1-1 microM) depressed paired-pulse inhibition in a dose-dependent manner that suggested agonist activity at higher (10-100 microM) concentrations. Intracellular recordings from CA1 neurons showed that Ro15-1788 reduced both orthodromically and antidromically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. The reduction of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential probably resulted from a postsynaptic effect on the conductance mechanism of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential, since there were no changes in resting input resistance, the inhibitory postsynaptic reversal potential or the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. These data suggest that in the hippocampal slice preparation either (1) an endogenous benzodiazepine agonist exists that can be displaced by Ro15-1788 or (2) Ro15-1788 has inverse agonist activity.", 
    "56": "The activity of three forms of ATPase were examined in fractions of the brain of the gerbil treated with ethylene glycol-N-N-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) under a variety of conditions of primary and secondary (reflow) ischemia. In animals which were unilateral ischemic (ligation of the right common carotid), damage to Na+, K+-ATPase alone was observed only after at least 6 hr of ischemia had elapsed. The phenomenon occurred in only symptomatic gerbils and was absent in animals which were either asymptomatic or only displayed partial neurological symptoms. Under conditions of bilateral cerebral ischemia, in which both carotid arteries were clamped, only irreversible ischemia (60 min) followed by reflow, was associated with highly significant damage to cerebral Na+, K+-ATPase. In regional studies of the forebrain involving ischemia for 60 min plus 30 min reflow, damage to Na+, K+-ATPase was evident in the cerebrum, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, while the hypothalamus and olfactory bulb were spared. Pretreatment of gerbils with allopurinol, clonazepam or combinations of thiopental plus either indomethacin or methylprednisolone offered protection to cerebral Na+, K+-ATPase subsequent to secondary ischemia. With only minor exceptions (striatum) neither Ca2+, Mg2+- nor Mn2+-ATPase were altered by stroke or treatment with drugs.", 
    "57": "Numerous beta-carboline-3-carboxamides were synthesized by amidation of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, with various amino acids and amino acid esters serving as amine components, and tested in respect to their affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor in mouse brain membranes. The title compounds have affinities in the low micromolar range. The results are discussed with respect to their relevance for a possible beta-carboline structure containing the endogenous ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "58": "Seven 3-N-substituted derivatives of 3-amino-beta-carboline were synthesized and their affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor were assessed in vitro. Two compounds, 3-(ethylamino)-beta-carboline and 3-[(methoxycarbonyl)amino]-beta-carboline (beta-CMC), showing IC50 values of 460 and 71 nM, respectively, were selected for in vivo studies. The former compound showed long-lasting proconvulsant activity in Papio papio baboons while beta-CMC was shown in mice to selectively antagonize the sedative effects of diazepam without exhibiting convulsant, proconvulsant, or anxiogenic activity by itself.", 
    "59": "CM 40907 [3-(4-hydroxypiperidyl)-6-(2'-chlorophenyl)-pyridazine] is a chemically original compound which possesses the pharmacological properties of a potent, p.o. active anticonvulsant. The anticonvulsant activity of CM 40907 was examined in mice, rats and photosensitive Papio-papio baboons and compared to that of phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine, sodium valproate and ethosuximide. In mice, CM 40907 antagonized electroconvulsive shock and chemically induced seizures with an overall potency comparable to that of carbamazepine and a therapeutic ratio (ED50 rotorod/ED50 electroshock) superior to that of ethosuximide, sodium valproate, phenobarbital and carbamazepine. In the rat CM 40907 suppressed completed kindled amygdaloid seizures and was approximately as active as phenobarbital. In naturally photosensitive Senegalese Papio-papio baboons CM 40907 antagonized myoclonus and cortical paroxysmal discharges. In this model CM 40907 was approximately one-fourth as potent as phenobarbital, twice as potent as carbamazepine and 6 times more potent than sodium valproate. In mice CM 40907, at anticonvulsant doses, increased the affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam for its central receptor site. Based on these results it is postulated that CM 40907 is a potent and relatively nonsedative anticonvulsant and may be of therapeutic benefit in epileptic disorders.", 
    "60": "Lever pressing by squirrel monkeys was maintained under two behavioral procedures known to be sensitive to anxiolytic drugs. Under one procedure, responding maintained by food was suppressed by electric shock (punishment). Under a second procedure, responding was maintained under a multiple schedule in which the first response after 5 min produced either food or shock depending on the stimulus that was present throughout the interval (fixed-interval schedule). Under the punishment schedule, chlordiazepoxide (1.0-100 mg/kg), pentobarbital (1.0-17.0 mg/kg) and ethanol (0.5-2.5 g/kg) increased responding. The benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (1.0-10.0 mg/kg), which was without behavioral activity when given alone, reversed the effects of chlordiazepoxide in a dose-dependent manner. Ro 15-1788 did not antagonize the effects of pentobarbital or ethanol but potentiated the rate-increasing effects of these compounds. Under the multiple fixed-interval food- or shock-presentation schedule, both chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital increased responding maintained by food but only decreased responding maintained by shock. Ro 15-1788 antagonized the rate-increasing effects of chlordiazepoxide under the food schedule and reversed the rate-decreasing effects during the shock-presentation schedule; pentobarbital effects were not altered by Ro 15-1788. Certain dose-combinations of chlordiazepoxide and Ro 15-1788 produced large increases in responding maintained by shock, an effect not seen with either drug alone. These studies indicate that Ro 15-1788 antagonizes the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines selectively but not those of other sedative-hypnotic drugs. These results also suggest that Ro 15-1788 may exert certain actions of its own or may unmask other drug effects when given in combination with benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine compounds.", 
    "61": "In the past 20 years significant advances in the pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence have been made, and research in this area is continuing. Therapeutic applications and current research in the use of pharmacological agents in maintenance therapy, treatment with narcotic antagonists, and narcotic detoxification are discussed. In addition, an overview is presented of recent developments in opioid pharmacology and of recently developed novel pharmacological agents which may prove useful in the future treatment and/or prevention of opioid dependence.", 
    "62": "The Quality Assurance Project is developing explicit and detailed treatment outlines for each of the major psychiatric disorders. Three sources of information are used: a meta-analysis of the treatment outcome literature, the opinions of a sample of practising psychiatrists, and the views of a panel of nominated experts. The recommendations for the treatment of anxiety states were as follows: Phenelzine and then the tricyclic antidepressants were the treatments of choice for panic disorder. Behaviour therapy--cognitive anxiety management, relaxation and hyperventilation control--being recommended as an essential adjunct to drug therapy. Relaxation and dynamic psychotherapy separately, or in combination, were the treatments of choice for generalised anxiety disorder with cognitive procedures being of value and benzodiazepines only being recommended for short-term use. In complicated cases of either panic disorder or generalised anxiety disorder a long-term supportive psychotherapeutic relationship was regarded as essential to ensure smooth progress in treatment. In adjustment disorder with anxious mood, procedures to permit adaptation to the stressor were recommended, while in post-traumatic stress disorder psychotherapeutic techniques to allow the trauma to be re-experienced and worked through were favoured.", 
    "63": "7 cases are reported demonstrating that intrathecal or epidural administration of somatostatin intraoperatively reduced the requirement for other anaesthetics. Somatostatin acts as a potent analgesic, which does not impair circulatory parameters and which possesses no centrally depressing effect. Spinal administration of somatostatin could therefore gain importance in high-risk category patients with normal metabolism.", 
    "64": "We have shown that diazepam (ED50 2.4 microM), flunitrazepam (ED50 10.2 microM) and Ro5-4864 (ED50 5 microM) are able to enhance both total and specific [3H]phenytoin binding. Picrotoxin (IC50 1.43 microM) and chloride, either NaCl or KCl (IC50 42.4 microM) inhibit both the increase in total and specific binding of [3H]phenytoin, Ro15-1788 does not. The optimum time for this enhancement was 3-4 hours. While the ED50's for the benzodiazepines are high their order of potency suggests that an involvement of both the \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine receptor and the GABA-chloride ionophore complex is likely. Clonazepam (IC50 23 microM), oxazepam (IC50 12 microM) chlordiazepoxide (IC50 35 microM) and Ro8682-10, a convulsant benzodiazepine (IC50 16 microM) all inhibit both total and specific [3H]phenytoin binding. These effects were not blocked by chloride ions, picrotoxin or Ro 15-1788, and reached equilibrium within 45 minutes. This order of potency also parallels that for the \"peripheral' benzodiazepine receptor in rat brain. These data suggest the presence of a micromolar benzodiazepine receptor site which may play a role in the control of CNS excitability. Nitrazepam, medazepam, bromazepam and the tetralobenzodiazepines U38335, U42794, U43434, and U37834 had no effect on total or specific [3H]phenytoin binding nor on the actions of the other benzodiazepines described in concentrations up to 50 microM.", 
    "65": "The use of benzodiazepines to overcome the possible debilitating effects of travel on football performance is a recent phenomenon and indicative of current usage of such drugs. Contemporary psychological theory is critical of many of the measures used to monitor such drugs. This study has created a battery of tests which include some measures which are deemed more ecologically valid and, for purposes of comparison, some traditional indices. On a sample of First Division professional Association footballers temazepam (40 mg) was compared with placebo on these measures and testing occurred on the afternoon following night time medication. The findings suggest that on such a protocol, perceptual-motor performance is not impaired.", 
    "66": "Triazolam 0.5 mg was administered to 11 dialysis patients and 11 age, weight and sex matched controls. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were higher in control subjects, but there were no other differences between the groups. When dialysis patients took triazolam with 3600 mg aluminum hydroxide suspension, Cmax and AUC were increased into the range observed in control subjects. It appears that triazolam can be used at normal doses in patients with renal dysfunction, without regard to interaction with aluminum hydroxide gel, or to alterations in elimination.", 
    "67": "The effects of relatively constant plasma levels of a rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine (triazolam) were studied in young healthy males to determine whether tolerance to certain effects may develop over a relatively short period of time. The drug was given over a period of 30 h (2 days and 1 night) at zero-order rate using a rectal osmotic pump. Performance was measured at 2 hourly intervals during the day and was continuously impaired during the infusion, though there was a rapid recovery when the infusion ceased. All tasks were affected, in particular mental arithmetic and letter cancellation, but there was some improvement in performance during the second day. The normal circadian improvement in performance may have contributed to this effect, but some degree of tolerance to the effect of the drug cannot be excluded. Overnight there was a marked reduction in wakefulness, suppression of slow wave sleep, and delay to the onset and reduction in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep. During the night after infusion there was less slow wave sleep and increased wakefulness. The experimental design may prove useful in the study of tolerance to drugs.", 
    "68": "The postnatal development of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors was monitored in Heterogeneous Stock (HS) mice, and the BDZ receptors were characterized and categorized into Type I and Type II receptors. When the number of 3H-Flu binding sites (Bmax) was assessed at weekly intervals after the birth of the animal, the number of sites in both the cortex and cerebellum increased significantly if the data was expressed as fmol/mg tissue. On the other hand, no significant change in 3H-Flu binding sites was evidenced in the cortex, and the number of 3H-Flu binding sites in the cerebellum decreased during postnatal development if Bmax values were expressed as fmole/mg protein. When receptor binding data was analyzed for the presence of Type I and Type II BDZ receptors, the changes in KD values for 3H-Flu binding development could be accounted for by changes in relative proportions of Type I and Type II receptors present in the cortex and cerebellum during the maturation process. Type II receptors predominated in both cortex and cerebellum at birth, and Type I receptors proliferated primarily during the first two weeks of postnatal life. In the cortex of adult mice there were approximately equal numbers of Type I and Type II BDZ receptors. In the cerebellum of adult mice, computer assisted analysis of binding data could not distinguish the presence of two distinct BDZ binding sites. However, Hill coefficients and overall binding constants determined from data on CL-218,872 displacement of 3H-Flu binding to cerebellar membranes indicated that cerebellar tissue from adult mice did contain a heterogeneous array of BDZ receptors.", 
    "69": "The incidence and consequences of the nausea and vomiting induced by many cancer chemotherapeutic regimes are explored and the emetogenic potential of the commonly used cytotoxic drugs evaluated. The physiology and pharmacology of chemotherapy-induced vomiting is largely unresolved but the postulated mechanisms are described and related to known properties of anti-emetic agents. The difficulties associated with the design and evaluation of trials assessing the effectiveness of single agent or combination therapy for this indication are discussed. After identifying general principles of anti-emetic prophylaxis, a critical evaluation is made of the effectiveness of the following drugs or classes of drugs, based on the available data: antihistamines, anticholinergics, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, domperidone, metoclopramide, cannabinoids, corticosteroids and benzodiazepines. Although there are still insufficient data to allow absolute recommendations to be made regarding the choice of anti-emetic therapy, considerations which should govern drug choice are listed and an algorithm presented as an aid to decision making. The contributions that can be made by a pharmacist in this area of drug use are noted.", 
    "70": "A simple approach to prove or disprove potentiation is described, which is based on the comparison of observed effects of reversibly acting drugs A plus B with effects of independently acting drugs in combination, since the latter already represent a special type of overadditive drug combination, i.e., potentiation. As an example, secretory studies in man using combinations of the antimuscarinic drug pirenzepine and the H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine or ranitidine were reevaluated. In these studies combined antisecretory effects were found which not only correspond to those of independently acting (i.e., functional) synergists, but even significantly exceed them. Pirenzepine caused 60 +/- 4.0%, and cimetidine 61 +/- 4.6% inhibition of peptone-stimulated acid secretion. In combination the effect amounted to 90 +/- 0.8% (n = 8) which is more pronounced than the calculated effect of functional synergists (83 +/- 3.1%). Similar results were obtained with pirenzepine plus ranitidine. Hence, a true interaction between antimuscarinic and H2-receptor antagonizing drugs to suppress gastric acid secretion can be assumed.", 
    "71": "It has been established in experiments on the isolated spinal cord of 7-14-day-old rats that the GABAB-mimetic phenibut (10(-5)--10(-4) M) elicits a slow-developing depolarization of motoneurons, suppression of spontaneous activity and polysynaptic reflex discharges of motoneurons, recorded from the ventral roots. Administered under the same conditions GABA produces de- and hyperpolarization of motoneurons. The depolarization of motoneurons elicited by phenibut and GABA is not reversed by picrotoxin in contradistinction to the GABA-induced hyperpolarization of motoneurons, being associated with a direct action of the GABA-mimetics on postsynaptic GABAB receptors of motoneurons. Diazepam (10(-9)--10(-6) M) potentiates the effects of phenibut supposedly via benzodiazepine receptors bound with GABAA receptors (an independent interaction).", 
    "72": "A series of 1-azacycloalkyl-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones were synthesized from 1-azacycloalkyl-2-benzoylanilines and corresponding imines and then evaluated for their central nervous system activities. Pharmacological data showed that some of these compounds have potent antidepressant properties, as assessed by their antagonism of tetrabenzine (TBZ) induced ptosis and their inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake into rat brain synaptosomes, as well as their moderate antianxiety properties of preventing of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) convulsion, suppressing conflict behavior, and displacing potential for [3H]diazepam binding. Introduction of a halogen substituent at position 7 of the 1,4-benzodiazepine ring lengthened the anti-PTZ effects, although the peak effect was slightly reduced and clearly enhanced the anti-PTZ and anticonflict properties. Introduction of Cl to the ortho position of the phenyl ring at position 5 greatly reduced the antidepressant properties. The secondary amine function of the azacyclic ring at position 1 was essential for the production of the antidepressant properties. Of these new series, 7-fluoro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-(4-piperidinyl)-2H-1,4-benzodi azepin-2 -one has the potential to become a useful antidepressant drug with a moderate antianxiety property.", 
    "73": "Participation of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the functions of dog cardiac ganglia was investigated. The ganglionic stimulants as well as agents affecting GABA system were given directly into the cardiac sympathetic ganglia through the right subclavian artery (i.a.), unless otherwise mentioned. Inhibition of endogenous GABA degradation by the GABA-transaminase inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) administered 10 mg/kg i.v. 2 hr before completion of surgical procedures did not alter the positive chronotropic responses to bethanecol (25 and 50 micrograms) and acetylcholine (25, 50 and 100 micrograms) but reduced markedly those to angiotensin II (1 and 2 micrograms). This reduction was antagonized by picrotoxin (5 mg). Diazepam given 10 mg/kg i.v. also inhibited the ganglionic responses to angiotensin II in both untreated and AOAA-pretreated dogs, this inhibition by diazepam being more marked in the AOAA-pretreated than in the untreated dogs. The same dose of diazepam did not affect the responses to acetylcholine but reduced to a certain degree of responses to bethanechol in the AOAA-pretreated dogs. These inhibitions by diazepam were also reversed by picrotoxin. After i.v. treatment with the glutamic acid decarboxylase inhibitors, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (50 mg/kg) or isoniazid (200 mg/kg), the ganglionic responses to angiotensin II were not altered, but inhibitory effects of diazepam on the responses to angiotensin II were eliminated after 3-mercaptopropionic acid but not after isoniazid. These results suggest that endogenous GABA may play an inhibitory role in the nonnicotinic ganglionic pathways and that diazepam probably exerts a ganglionic action through endogenous GABAergic mechanisms.", 
    "74": "In a controlled study on 18 caged dogs, the effects of 2 psychoactive drugs on friendliness, excitability, and fearfulness were systematically and quantitatively evaluated. Diazepam was selected to represent the benzodiazepine group, and chlorpromazine represented the phenothiazine group. Diazepam was more effective in suppressing signs of fear than was chlorpromazine. Diazepam increased measures of excitability, whereas chlorpromazine had opposite effects.", 
    "75": "Clinical and electrical evidence of peripheral neuropathy may result from long term treatment with phenytoin or barbiturates, especially in combination, or after repeated exposure to toxic blood concentrations of either drug. Prolonged acute toxicity with phenytoin may rarely lead to permanent residual ataxia. Reversible dystonia may occasionally be precipitated by phenytoin or carbamazepine; asterixis by phenytoin, barbiturates or carbamazepine; and, more commonly, tremor by valproate. All the major anticonvulsant drugs, especially in combination, can produce occasional subacute cognitive or behavioural syndromes. In varying degrees, the drugs also impair attention, concentration, memory, mental speed or processing, or motor speed. Possible mechanisms of impaired mental function include neuronal damage, or disturbance of folic acid, monoamine or hormonal metabolism. The relative influence on neurological or psychological function is an important factor in the choice of anticonvulsant drug for the treatment of epilepsy."
