    "0": "The endocannabinoid system and the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) are required for the extinction of conditioned fear. CB1 antagonists have been shown to prevent extinction when delivered both systemically and within the amygdala. Anatomical studies suggest that CB1Rs in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are expressed on GABAergic interneurons expressing the anxiogenic peptide cholecystokinin (CCK). Pre-synaptic CB1Rs inhibit neurotransmitter release, suggesting that CB1R activation during extinction may decrease CCK peptide release as well as GABA release. Thus, we examined whether extinction involves the CB1R modulation of CCK2 receptor activation. We found that intracerebroventricular administration of the CCK2 agonist pentagastrin dose-dependently impaired extinction of conditioned fear. Systemic administration of a CB1 antagonist, rimonabant (SR141716), also potently inhibited extinction learning. This effect was ameliorated with systemic administration of a CCK2 antagonist, CR2945. Furthermore, the extinction blockade by systemic SR141716 was reversed with intra-BLA, but not intrastriatal, infusion of CR2945. Lastly, as extinction usually leads to an increase in Akt phosphorylation, a biochemical effect antagonized by systemic CB1 antagonist treatment, we examined whether CR2945 co-administration would increase extinction-induced p-Akt levels. We observed that extinction-trained animals showed increased Akt phosphorylation following extinction, CB1 antagonist-treated animals showed p-Akt levels similar to those of non-extinction trained animals, and co-administration of CR2945 with SR141716 led to levels of p-Akt similar to those of vehicle-treated, extinction-trained controls. Together, these data suggest that interactions between the endocannabinoid and CCKergic transmitter systems may underlie the process of extinction of conditioned fear.", 
    "1": "The endocannabinoid-inactivating enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channel are new targets for the development of anxiolytic drugs. We studied the effect on anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze of a dual FAAH/TRPV1 blocker, N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (AA-5-HT). In male C57BL/6J mice, acute intraperitoneal administration of AA-5-HT (0.1-2.5 mg/kg) increased both the time spent and the number of entries in the open arm, while being inactive at the highest dose tested (5 mg/kg). AA-5-HT was more potent than selective blockers of FAAH or TRPV1 (URB597 and SB366791, respectively). In male Swiss mice, AA-5-HT had to be administered chronically to observe an anxiolytic effect at an intermediate dose (2.5 mg/kg), the highest dose (5 mg/kg) being anxiogenic, and 1 mg/kg being ineffective. In both strains, the anxiolytic effects of AA-5-HT were paralleled by elevation of brain endocannabinoid levels and were reversed by per se inactive doses of the cannabinoid receptors of type-1 (CB(1)) receptor antagonist AM251, or the TRPV1 agonist, olvanil. Immunohistochemical localization of CB(1) and TRPV1 receptors was observed in mouse prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus. Simultaneous 'indirect' activation of CB(1) receptors following FAAH inhibition, and antagonism at TRPV1 receptors might represent a new therapeutic strategy against anxiety.",

    "11": "Therapeutic use of atypical antipsychotic agents is often associated with weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance. The once-daily human GLP-1 analog liraglutide improves glycemic control and reduces body weight. We have investigated the ability of liraglutide to improve olanzapine-induced metabolic effects in female rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with subcutaneous osmotic mini pumps for delivery of olanzapine (1.75 mg/24 h) or vehicle for 28 days (n=20). After 14 days, ten animals from each group were given liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily for the remainder of the study. Compared to vehicle treated animals, olanzapine infusion for 4 weeks significantly increased end point cumulated food intake (667.3+/-7.0 versus 593.2+/-13.2g, p<0.01), body weight (306.6+/-4.2 versus 276.4+/-3.6 g, p<0.001), subcutaneous inguinal fat (3.4+/-0.3 versus 1.9+/-0.1 g, p<0.001), mesenteric fat (3.1+/-0.2 versus 1.7+/-0.2g, p<0.001), retroperitoneal fat (6.2+/-0.6 versus 2.8+/-0.3 g, p<0.001), and impaired glucose tolerance, measured as total area under the glucose curve during an oral glucose tolerance test (1906+/-66 versus 1770+/-28 mMxmin, p<0.05). These olanzapine-induced elevations were significantly reduced by liraglutide (cumulated food intake: 601.8+/-20.4 g, p<0.01; body weight: 280.2+/-5.6 g, p<0.001; subcutaneous inguinal fat: 2.4+/-0.2 g, p<0.001; mesenteric fat: 1.8+/-0.1 g, p<0.001; retroperitoneal fat: 3.5+/-0.4 g, p<0.001; AUC: 1764+/-32 mMxmin, p<0.05). In conclusion, subcutaneous olanzapine infusion in female rats leads to weight gain and metabolic changes of which several are reversed following liraglutide treatment. It may therefore be relevant to study these effects of liraglutide in patients treated with atypically antipsychotics.", 
    "12": "We investigated the effects of several frequently described medication regimens on annual percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD). A longitudinal cohort study (a retrospective analysis) was conducted. Subjects in the Adult Health Study (a prospective cohort study begun in 1958) have been followed through biennial medical examinations in Hiroshima, Japan. Participants were 2,111 subjects (67% women; aged 47-95 years) who were undergoing biennial health examinations from 1994 to 2000. The subjects were examined for the effect of certain drugs on bone mineral change during baseline and one follow-up (4 year later) measurements. Mean annual percentage change in BMD at the femoral neck was -0.38% for men, and -1.14% for women. After adjustment for sex, age, change of weight, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, annual percentage change in BMD decreased by 0.61% among individuals taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors continuously in comparison with individuals who had not taken them (p = 0.002): also decreased 0.40% among individuals taking benzodiazepines (BZDs) continuously (p = 0.034). Our results suggest that careful consideration should be given to the use of ACE inhibitors and BZDs in a cohort of Japanese elderly.", 
    "13": "Early-onset psychotic illnesses in children and adolescents are not as rare as is commonly believed. These disorders, which include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and major depression with psychotic features, often have a chronic and severe course and poor long-term outcome. Many patients with early-onset schizophrenia have greater functional impairments than most patients with adult-onset schizophrenia. Magnetic resonance imaging studies show that patients with early-onset schizophrenia experience substantial gray matter loss during adolescence, which is not observed in studies of patients with adult-onset schizophrenia. The chronic course, severe functional impairments, and poor prognosis of early-onset psychosis create a great need to identify effective and safe treatments for youth with psychosis. Although atypical anti-psychotics have been considered superior to traditional antipsychotics, there has been little controlled information to inform clinical decisions until recently. Over the past 5 years, several studies have been initiated to address these questions. The results of the studies completed to date are reviewed.",

Although no pharmacotherapy is currently approved for use in this population, evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic treatment may be useful in patients with these conditions who present with problematic aggression. Currently, research on risperidone shows it to be effective in treating aggressive behavior in this patient population. Limited research is also available on olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, but more research is needed on these and other agents. As with any pharmacotherapy, adverse events (including weight gain, headache, and somnolence) should be carefully considered with these medications, especially in children and adolescents, and it is important to properly dose and monitor patients during medication therapy.", 
    "16": "In the present study, we examined the effects of acamprosate for its ability to reduce handling induced convulsions (HICs) during alcohol withdrawal. Diazepam was used as a positive control. Swiss Webster male mice received three daily IP injections of alcohol (2.5 g/kg) or alcohol (2.5 g/kg)+methylpyrazole (4-MP) (9 mg/kg). (4-MP, being an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor slows down the breakdown of alcohol. 4-MP in combination with alcohol exhibits a dramatic increase in blood alcohol level compared to alcohol alone). Ten hours following the last alcohol injection, the mice were picked up by the tail and examined for their seizure susceptibility (HICs). Diazepam, a benzodiazepine known to reduce seizures during alcohol withdrawal, significantly reduced these HICs at doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg (p's<0.001). Acamprosate, an anti-relapse compound used clinically in newly abstinent alcoholics, also reduced these HICs at doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg (p's<0.05). This study supports the use of acamprosate during periods of alcohol withdrawal as well as during abstinence.",

    "21": "Several studies have shown that cannabinoids have anticonvulsant properties that are mediated through activation of the cannabinoid CB1 receptors. In addition, endogenous cannabinoid compounds (endocannabinoids) regulate synaptic transmission and dampen seizure activity via activation of the same receptors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible interactions between antiepileptic effects of cannabinoid compounds and diazepam using electroshock-induced model of seizure in mice. Electroconvulsions were produced by means of an alternating current (ear-clip electrodes, fixed current intensity 35 mA, stimulus duration 0.2 s) and tonic hindlimb extension was taken as the endpoint. All experiments were performed on groups of ten mice and the number of animals who did not display seizure reported as percent protection. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of diazepam (0.25-2 mg/kg) and CB1 receptor agonist WIN55212-2 (0.5-4 mg/kg) dose dependently produced an antiepileptic effect evaluated in terms of increased percentage of protection against electroshock-induced seizure. Logistic regression analysis indicated synergistic interactions in anticonvulsant action after co-administration of diazepam and WIN55212-2 in fixed-ratio combination of 3:1 (diazepam:WIN55212-2), while an additive effect was resulted after co-administration of 1:1 and 1:3 fixed-ratio combinations. Administration of various doses of the endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor, AM404, did not produce any effect on electroshock-induced seizure. Moreover, co-administration of AM404 and diazepam did not produce significant interaction in antiepileptic properties of these compounds. Administration of the fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, URB597, produced significant antiepileptic effect. Co-administration of URB597 and diazepam led to an antagonistic interaction in protection against shock-induced seizure. Co-administration of different doses of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251 did not alter the antiepileptic effect of diazepam in the electroshock-induced seizure test. These results demonstrate that endocannabinoid system participates in the modulation of seizure and combination of small doses of exogenous CB1 receptor agonists with diazepam may have effective consequences in seizure control. Furthermore, inhibiting the endocannabinoid degradation could be more efficacious in modulating seizure than preventing their uptake. This study also suggests that the effects of cannabinoids on epilepsy depend on the relative cannabinoid responsiveness of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. While, the antiepileptic effects of cannabinoid compounds are likely by affecting excitatory glutamate neurotransmission, the antagonistic interaction between cannabinoid compounds and diazepam to protect seizure is due to the cannabinoid action on inhibitory GABAergic system.",

    "23": "The present paper reports about a spontaneous rib fracture in a female patient (age 52) taking neuroleptics (mainly risperidone), antidepressants (mainly sertraline), and anxiolytics (mainly lorazepam). At the time of the fracture a severe osteoporosis and a strongly enhanced plasma prolactin level (117 ng/ml; normal values: 3-24 ng/ml) were detected. The latter one normalized 2 months after abandoning sertraline and risperidone. After this normalization, the patient did not report further accidents up to now.",

Mammoplasia and increased plasma prolactin can occur during SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) or trazodone administration. The role of anxiolytics is less clear. The causal relationship between osteoporosis and long-term use of neuroleptics and antidepressants was assessed using probability scores, more particularly the Naranjo probability scale and the Bradford-Hill criteria of causality.

In order to investigate the role of cerebral benzodiazepinereceptor binding in SPS, we performed [(11)C]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) in a female patient with SPS compared to nine healthy controls. FMZ is a radioligand to the postsynaptic central benzodiazepine receptor which is co-localized with the GABA-A receptor. In the SPS patient, we found a global reduction of cortical FMZ binding. In addition, distinct local clusters of reduced radiotracer binding were observed. These data provide first in vivo evidence for a reduced postsynaptic GABA-A receptor availability which may reflect the loss of GABAergic neuronal inhibition in SPS.",

We examined the influence of long-term treatment with olanzapine on plasma levels of hormones regulating food intake and energy homeostasis in schizophrenia. In this study, olanzapine was administered to 28 Japanese inpatients for 16 weeks after switching from typical antipsychotic drugs or risperidone. At endpoint, no significant changes in body weight or body mass index were found. There was a significant decrease in the plasma levels of ghrelin without any accompanying change in active, n-octanoylated ghrelin. Serum levels of leptin tended to be increased and a significant reduction in plasma cortisol levels was found. In addition, the levels of fasting blood sugar as well as free fatty acid were significantly decreased. Furthermore, we did not confirm any marked weight gain induced by chronic administration of olanzapine as previously reported. The reason for this discrepancy may be due to differences in subjects and treatment settings. Based on these findings, it is unlikely that the decrease in plasma ghrelin levels by chronic administration of olanzapine affects weight gain. Further studies examining the effect of chronic olanzapine administration on weight and energy homeostasis in inpatients are required.",

    "70": "The second-generation antipsychotics are effective for treating psychotic disorders and incur fewer motor side effects than are commonly experienced with the use of first-generation antipsychotics. However, their use is commonly associated with weight gain and metabolic disturbances. This study examined weight and metabolic changes with two widely used antipsychotics, risperidone and olanzapine; addressing the issue of early monitoring for metabolic side effects.", 
    "71": "This 8-week double blind randomized trial included patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N = 377) randomly assigned to risperidone (2-6 mg/day) or olanzapine (5-20 mg/day).

Increases in mean TC (13.5 mg/dl (SD 2.4), LDL-C (11.0 mg/dl (SD 2.2)) and TG (14.8 mg/dl (SD = 7.6)) occurred in the olanzapine group while significant changes in TC (-3.9 mg/dl (SD = 2.5)) and TG (-32.8 mg/dl (SD = 7.8)) were noted in the risperidone group. Men (not women) on olanzapine had higher than expected increases in lipids given the amount of weight gain. Baseline values and prior therapy did not contribute to the significant differences, however BMI increases (p = 0.0002) were linked to study discontinuation in both drug groups.",

A double-blind, placebo (starch 50 mg) controlled experiment was carried out with 19 patients randomly divided into diazepam (n = 10) and placebo (n = 9) groups. They were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and tests were conducted for immediate and delayed (short-term) memory with emotionally toned stimuli (negative, positive, neutral), recognition, and semantic memory in visual or auditory modality. The Visual Analog Mood scale (VAMS) was applied to measure anxiety and mood changes after the administration of drugs (30 minutes and 6 hours). Higher scores in the positively toned list among patients who received diazepam were observed, at the 30-minute compared with the 6-hour evaluation. The recall index of positive words in the diazepam group was positive and significantly different from the index of the placebo group. No anterograde amnesia following diazepam was observed. The neural model of a dysfunction of limbic prefrontal cortical structures that impairs the modulation of the amygdala in major depression may explain the present results. Consequently, the action of diazepam on the amygdala, which has been proposed to be the basis of its anxiolytic action, might be altered, modifying the modulation of memory in our patients.",

The results showed that the density (Bmax) of peripheral BDZ receptors was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects, with no change in the dissociation constant. No correlation with demographic or clinical features was observed. These findings would suggest that alterations of peripheral BDZ receptors are present in patients suffering from bipolar disorder, but it is premature to conclude whether they may be related to the pathophysiology of the disorder, or are secondary to changes occurring in other systems, such as those regulating the stress response.",

These agents were both more effective and better tolerated than benzodiazepines and appeared to facilitate engagement in rehabilitation therapies, including psychotherapy. Further investigation of the pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric disturbances in this population using prospective, blinded, placebo-controlled methods is recommended.",

By adding two equipotent doses (3 and 6 mg/kg) of either OL or ST to a high-sweet, high-fat (HS-HF) diet, mice were allowed to self-administer drugs up to 50 days. Body weight and food intake were evaluated daily. Locomotor activity was recorded over 48 h at two different time points. Dyslipidemia was measured by central visceral obesity. Blood serum levels of insulin (IN), glucose (Glu), triglycerides (TGs), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), cholesterol (Ch), and ketone (Ke) bodies were quantified. OL treatment at 3 mg/kg enhanced body weight, whereas at the highest dose, the increase became evident only during the last 10 days of treatment. OL (3 mg/kg) increased HS-HF intake over time, whereas the highest dose reduced intake during the second 10 and final 10 days of administration. Both compounds induced nocturnal hypomotility at the highest dose. In contrast to ST, 3 mg/kg OL elevated serum levels of IN, Glu, TG, NEFA, Ch, and Ke, whereas 6 mg/kg OL elevated those of Glu, TG, and Ch. In contrast, ST did not affect weight gain, food intake, and metabolic markers. Given the similarities between OL-induced obesogenic effects and medical reports, this study further supports the view that ST may represent a new class of agents characterized by a low propensity to induce side effects with promising clinical safety.", 
    "82": "Delirium, the acute confusional syndrome, is a common although infradiagnosed problem in the critically ill patient, especially the hypoactive subtype. Risk factors for delirium are previous cognitive disturbances, some comorbidities, ambiental factors and the acute organic alterations of critical illness. Delirium is associated to an increase in short and long term mortality, prolongation of mechanical ventilation, increased Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and cognitive impairment after hospital discharge. In the last years several tools have been developed to detect delirium in critically ill patients. The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU patients (CAM-ICU) have been validated and are useful even in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Some interventions on specific risk factors can decrease the incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients. Treatment of delirium is based on the identification and correction of contributing factors, the introduction of support measures, and pharmacological therapy for symptomatic control. Halloperidol is the first line therapy of delirium in the critically ill patient, while experience with atypical neuroleptics and other drugs is limited, precluding to do recommendations about its use. Neuroleptic drugs can produce severe side effects and need careful dosage and monitoring. When agitation is important, can be necessary the simultaneous use of benzodiazepines or propofol, and some times, the temporal and protocolized application of physical restraints.", 
    "83": "One of the main factors to keep in mind for drug selection for the sedation of a critical patient is its foreseen duration. We have denominated by consent, short sedation that whose duration is less than 72 h. We advise the existence and application of a protocol of short sedation in all intensive care units. This protocol must guarantee the patient's analgesia at all times and its application must not increase the times of waking up and weaning of the mechanical ventilation. In this chapter the pharmacology and the comparative studies of the drugs more used for this aim are revised and the clinical recommendations are settle down. Some recommendations for specific situations are also settle down and a role is assigned to less habitual drugs such as ketamine.", 
    "84": "Given the heterogeneity of GABA(A) receptor, the pharmacological significance of identifying subtype selective modulators is increasingly being recognized. Thus, drugs selective for GABA(A) alpha(3) receptors are expected to display fewer side effects than the drugs presently in clinical use. Hence we carried out 3D QSAR (three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship) studies on a series of novel GABA(A) alpha(3) subtype selective modulators to gain more insight into subtype affinity. To identify the 3D functional attributes required for subtype selectivity, a chemical feature-based pharmacophore, primarily based on selective ligands representing diverse structural classes was generated. The obtained pseudo receptor model of the benzodiazepine binding site revealed a binding mode akin to \"Message-Address\" concept. Scaffold hopping was carried out across multi-conformational May Bridge database for the identification of novel chemotypes. Further a focused data reduction approach was employed to choose a subset of enriched compounds based on \"Drug likeness\" and \"Similarity-based\" methods. These results taken together could provide impetus for rational design and optimization of more selective and high affinity leads with a potential to have decreased adverse effects.",

Spontaneous circulation was restored at 25 degrees C under epinephrin after three hours of chest compression from home to the intensive-care unit and rewarming with extracorporeal circulation.

We therefore surveyed 200 Fellows of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists on the choice of drugs and monitoring, use of analgesic throat spray and prophylactic intravenous fluids and the depth of sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy. Our response rate was 57% and endoscopy formed a significant part of most respondents' practices. Propofol was used for almost all procedures, in combination with midazolam alone (14%), fentanyl alone (6%), midazolam and fentanyl (61%), another drug (15%) or no adjuvant (4%). The majority of patients received prophylactic intravenous fluids for endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (83%) and colonoscopy (64%), but not for gastroscopy (20%). All patients received supplemental oxygen and monitoring with pulse oximetry. However over 20% of patients having gastroscopy or colonoscopy did not have non-invasive blood pressure monitoring. A maximum depth of sedation during which the patient was unresponsive to painful stimulation (commensurate with general anaesthesia) was targeted by 54% of respondents. Significant variations exist in the practice of sedation and monitoring for endoscopy in adult patients by anaesthetists in Australia.", 
    "93": "Intrathecal midazolam binds with gamma aminobutyric acid-A receptors in the spinal cord leading to an analgesic effect. Clinical studies suggested that intrathecal midazolam may also reduce nausea and vomiting when used as an adjunct to other spinal medications. However, the potential neurotoxic effect of intrathecal midazolam remains a concern. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness and side-effects of intrathecal midazolam in the perioperative and peripartum settings. Thirteen randomised controlled studies from MEDLINE (from 1966 to July 1, 2007), EMBASE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases, involving a total of 672 patients, were considered. Volunteer, animal and chronic pain studies were excluded. Adding intrathecal midazolam to other spinal medications reduced the incidence of nausea and vomiting (odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.90, P=0.02; I2=4%) and delayed the time to request for rescue analgesia (weighted-mean-difference=98.7 min, 95% CI: 76.1 to 121.4, P<0.00001; I2=98.5%). Intrathecal midazolam did not affect the duration of motor blockade (weighted-mean-difference =25.1 min, 95% CI -7.6 to 57.8, P=0.13, I2=94.8%). The incidence of neurological symptoms after intrathecal midazolam was uncommon (1.8%) and did not differ from placebo (odds ratio 1.20, 95% CI 0.22 to 6.68, P=0.84). Based on the limited data available, intrathecal midazolam appears to improve perioperative analgesia and reduce nausea and vomiting during caesarean delivery. A multicentre registry or large randomised controlled study with a prolonged follow-up period would be useful to confirm the clinical safety of intrathecal midazolam.",

    "98": "There is considerable variability in response to intravenously administered anesthetic drugs (e.g., hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and narcotics) that have a rapid onset of effect (such as hypnosis, anxiolysis, and analgesia) and a low margin of safety (because of cardiovascular or respiratory depression, etc.). Although the onset of effect for these drugs occurs seconds to minutes after injection, traditional pharmacokinetic models are based on blood samples that are first obtained after drug effects have peaked. As a result, many studies have failed to provide a pharmacokinetic rationale for dosage adjustments of these drugs.", 
    "99": "Initial effects of drugs of abuse seem to converge on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway originating from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Even after a single dose, many drugs of abuse are able to modulate the glutamatergic transmission activating the VTA dopamine neurons, which may represent a critical early stage in the development of addiction. Ligands acting on the benzodiazepine site of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors are known to be rewarding in animal models and have abuse liability in humans, but notably little evidence exists on the involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine system in their effects. Here we report that single in vivo doses of benzodiazepine-site agonists, similar to morphine and ethanol, induce a modulation in the glutamatergic transmission of VTA dopamine neurons. This is seen 24 h later as an increase in the ratio between alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitatory currents using whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in mouse VTA slices. The effect was due to increased frequency of spontaneous miniature AMPA receptor-mediated currents. It lasted at least 3 days after the injection of diazepam, and was prevented by coadministration of the benzodiazepine-site antagonist flumazenil or the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine. A single injection of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit-preferring benzodiazepine-site ligand zolpidem also produced an increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio in VTA dopamine neurons. These findings suggest a role for the mesolimbic dopamine system in the initial actions of and on neuronal adaptation to benzodiazepines.", 
    "100": "The respiratory effects of benzodiazepines have been controversial. This investigation aimed to study the effects of oral alprazolam on ventilation. In a randomised, double-blind cross-over protocol, 20 healthy men ingested 1 mg of alprazolam or placebo in random order, 1 week apart. Ventilation was unobtrusively monitored by inductance plethysmography along with end-tidal PCO(2) and pulse oximetry 60-160 min after drug intake. Subjects were encouraged to keep their eyes open. Mean +/- SD minute ventilation 120 min after alprazolam and placebo was similar (6.21 +/- 0.71 vs 6.41 +/- 1.12 L/min, P = NS). End-tidal PCO(2) and oxygen saturation did also not differ between treatments. However, coefficients of variation of minute ventilation after alprazolam exceeded those after placebo (43 +/- 23% vs 31 +/- 13%, P < 0.05). More encouragements to keep the eyes open were required after alprazolam than after placebo (5.2 +/- 5.7 vs 1.3 +/- 2.3 calls, P < 0.05). In a multiple regression analysis, higher coefficients of variation of minute ventilation after alprazolam were related to a greater number of calls. Oral alprazolam in a mildly sedative dose has no clinically relevant effect on ventilation in healthy, awake men. The increased variability of ventilation on alprazolam seems related to vigilance fluctuations rather than to a direct drug effect on ventilation.", 
    "101": "Studies in human volunteers that can demonstrate proof of concept are attractive in that possible mechanisms and potential new drug treatments can be examined. We have been developing models of anxiety disorders using the inhalation of 7.5% CO(2) for 20 min to model generalised anxiety disorder, as well as using the previously reported 35% CO(2) as a model for panic anxiety. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteer subjects, we compared a full agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor that binds to four alpha-subtypes of the receptor (alpha-1,-2,-3,-5) (alprazolam 1 mg), with zolpidem (5 mg), an agonist selective for the alpha-1 subtype of the gamma amino butyric acid-receptor subtype A (GABA-A) receptor, which is a widely used hypnotic drug. Compared with placebo, both drugs significantly attenuated peak CO(2)-induced changes in subjective feelings after the inhalation of 7.5% CO(2) for 20 min. However, there were fewer significant differences after a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO(2), where zolpidem was less efficacious than alprazolam at reducing CO(2)-induced symptoms. In conclusion, our results show that zolpidem shows some anxiolytic efficacy in the 7.5% CO(2) model, similar to alprazolam, and this is the first report of such an effect of zolpidem in a model of anxiety. These and other studies of benzodiazepines in clinical and volunteer studies suggest a definite role of the GABA-A receptor in CO(2)-induced anxiety, and it would be of interest to examine other GABA-A receptor subtype selective drugs, which are now in early phase clinical studies and are showing selective efficacy in pharmacodynamic studies.", 
    "102": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of treatment with haloperidol, olanzapine and risperidone on cardiovascular variability in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia by means of spectral analysis. Unmedicated patients (n = 18) had a higher mean heart rate and a tendency for a lower high-frequency power of heart rate variability than healthy control subjects (n = 57), indicating a decreased cardiac vagal control in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia. Patients treated with haloperidol (n = 10) showed significantly lower low-frequency power of heart rate and systolic blood pressure variability compared with olanzapine-treated patients, suggesting that haloperidol attenuated sympathetic functioning. On the contrary, olanzapine-treated patients (n = 10) showed the highest power in the low-frequency range of heart rate and systolic blood pressure variability, suggesting an increased sympathetic cardiac functioning. No significant effects of risperidone (n = 13) were found. None of the antipsychotic agents differed in their parasympathetic cardiovascular effects. We conclude that young, unmedicated patients with schizophrenia differed from controls in their parasympathetic functioning, but the antipsychotic agents haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine induced only minor cardiovascular side effects.", 
    "103": "We report five cases of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) that were probably associated with olanzapine. The first patient showed a good response to olanzapine, but the RLS symptoms associated with olanzapine resulted in poor long-term compliance, eventually leading to frequent relapse of psychotic symptoms. The second patient exhibited sudden PLMS following olanzapine injection. The third patient had been suffering from serious akathisia while on risperidone, and was cured after switching to olanzapine, but thereafter the patient suffered from RLS at nighttime. The fourth patient showed RLS symptoms that were initially caused by a 20-mg daily olanzapine dosage and were later mitigated when olanzapine was reduced and ropinirole was administered. The fifth patient exhibited paraesthesia and agitation caused by olanzapine that was misdiagnosed as psychotic agitation. Increasing the olanzapine dosage severely aggravated the symptoms of RLS. Antipsychotic-induced RLS and PLMS are not well-recognized side effects of antipsychotics, with the symptoms often misdiagnosed as psychotic agitation. These cases also suggest that the occurrence of RLS can cause noncompliance with antipsychotics in psychiatric patients, and thus aggravate their psychotic symptoms.",

In a large-scale naturalistic therapeutic drug monitoring study, daily amisulpride dose, trough and dose-corrected amisulpride plasma levels, co-medication, clinical effectiveness (CGI) and side effects (UKU) were compared between age groups in 395 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (46% women; mean age 39.1 +/- 14.2 years, range 18-83 years) under amisulpride therapy. Mean amisulpride doses (574 +/- 269 mg/day), plasma levels (304 +/- 274 ng/mL), dose-corrected amisulpride plasma levels (C/D ratios, 0.52 +/- 0.41 ng/mL:mg), clinical response (at least moderate improvement, 71.6%), and side effects (any side effect, 32.2%; extrapyramidal symptoms, 14.9%) were comparable between age groups (P > 0.25). At higher age, significantly more benzodiazepines (P = 0.04), non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (P = 0.004) and non-psychotropic medications (P < 0.0001) were prescribed. The naturalistic study showed higher C/D ratios in women (P = 0.019) and a slight increase of C/D ratios with age (P = 0.026), but no substantial age-dependent effects on amisulpride doses or plasma levels. In patients above 60 years, clinical response was associated with lower amisulpride plasma levels (P = 0.016) at comparable doses. Neither the age-dependent decrease of amisulpride clearance nor the significantly higher prevalence of co-morbidity and co-medication seem to be the reasons for definite clinical concerns against amisulpride treatment of elderly if contraindications are seriously taken.",

This was further confirmed by time-locked silent EMG. During ENM occurrence or recurrence, habitual seizures and interictal discharges were exaggerated. In some patients, the changes in antiepileptic drug regimens in relation to ENM appearance included add-on therapy with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenobarbital or withdrawal of valproate. ENM was controlled in most cases by administration of various combinations of valproate, clonazepam, and corticosteroids.",

Some antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenobarbital, may be related to ENM occurrence during spontaneous aggravation of ABPE. Various combinations of valproate, benzodiazepines, and corticosteroids are relatively effective for treating ENM that occurs in ABPE.",

    "124": "The fragmentation patterns of a series of three novel synthesized 3-hydroxy-4-phenyl-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-ones (1-3), possessing the same backbone structure, were investigated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques. A simple methodology, based on the use of ESI (positive ion mode) and by increasing the declustering potential in the atmospheric pressure/vacuum interface, collision-induced dissociation (CID), was used to enhance the formation of the fragment ions. In general, the novel synthetic 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives afforded, in the gas phase, both protonated and sodiated molecules. This led to the confirmation of the molecular masses and chemical structures of the studied compounds. Exact accurate masses were measured using a high-resolution ESI-quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight (QqToF)-MS/MS hybrid mass spectrometer instrument. The breakdown routes of the protonated molecules were rationalized by conducting low-energy collision CID-MS/MS analyses (product ion- and precursor ion scans) using a conventional quadrupole-hexapole-quadrupole (QhQ) tandem mass spectrometer. All the observed major fragmentations for the 1,5-benzodiazepines occurred in the saturated seven-membered ring containing the nitrogen atoms. These formed a multitude of product ions by different breakdown routes. All the major fragmentations involved cleavages of the N-1-C-2 and C-3-C-4 bonds. These occurred with concomitant eliminations of glyoxal, benzene and ethyl formate, forming the product ion at m/z 119, which was observed in all the studied compounds. In addition, an unique simultaneous CID-MS/MS fragmentation was noticed for the 1,5-benzodiazepines 1 and 3, which occurred by a pathway dictated by the substituent located on the N-1-position. It was evident that the aromatic ring portion of the 1,5-benzodiazepines was resistant to CID-MS/MS fragmentation. Re-confirmation of the various geneses of the product ions was achieved by conducting a series of precursor ion scans. ESI-MS and CID-MS/MS analyses have thus proven to be a specific and very sensitive method for the structural identification of these novel 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "125": "The purpose of this review is to assess the benefits and risks associated with the use of the ketolide antibacterial telithromycin, currently licensed for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Telithromycin is active against both the major (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) and atypical/intracellular (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) CAP pathogens. It is associated with a low potential to select for resistance and has maintained its in vitro activity against isolates of respiratory pathogens in countries where it has been in clinical use for several years. In randomized clinical trials, telithromycin has demonstrated efficacy comparable to the established antibacterial classes (macrolides, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams) in the treatment of CAP.The safety profile of telithromycin is broadly similar to that of other antibacterials used to treat CAP. The most common adverse events are gastrointestinal adverse effects and headache; these are generally mild to moderate in severity and reversible. Telithromycin appears to be well tolerated by adult patients in all age groups, including those with co-morbid conditions. In common with other antibacterials, telithromycin has the potential to affect the corrected QT interval; the concomitant use of cisapride or pimozide with telithromycin is contraindicated, while telithromycin should be avoided in patients receiving Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs. Visual disturbances (usually transient) have occurred in a small proportion of patients treated with telithromycin; it is recommended that activities such as driving are minimized during treatment. Telithromycin is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis. Hepatic dysfunction may occur in some patients taking telithromycin; rare cases of acute hepatic failure and severe liver injury, including deaths, have been reported. As telithromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 system, coadministration of telithromycin with drugs metabolized by this pathway may require dose adjustments (e.g. with benzodiazepines) or a temporary hiatus in the use of the coadministered drug (e.g. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) metabolized by CYP3A4. Telithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants; careful monitoring is recommended in patients receiving telithromycin and oral anticoagulants simultaneously.Although serious and sometimes fatal events have occurred in patients receiving telithromycin therapy, current data indicate that telithromycin offers an acceptable benefit risk ratio in the treatment of mild to moderate CAP.",

    "148": "The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect sizes of drug interactions on plasma olanzapine concentrations while adjusting for potentially confounding factors such as smoking. The estimation was performed by using a mixed model, data from a series of previously published studies of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and mirtazapine, and unpublished data from patients under clinical therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The total sample included 163 adult patients (age>or=18 years) who provided both steady-state plasma olanzapine concentrations and smoking information. They provided a total of 360 olanzapine concentrations (1 to 11 measures per patient). Smoking and concomitant carbamazepine or lamotrigine use were found to have significant effects on median plasma olanzapine concentrations. The effects of lamotrigine on plasma olanzapine concentrations were modified by smoking. After adjusting for olanzapine dose and carbamazepine intake, plasma olanzapine concentrations were 10% lower in non-smokers who were taking lamotrigine than in non-smokers who were not taking lamotrigine; olanzapine concentrations were 35% higher in smokers who were taking lamotrigine than in smokers who were not taking lamotrigine; olanzapine concentrations were 41% lower in smokers who were not taking lamotrigine than in non-smokers who were not taking lamotrigine; and olanzapine concentrations were 11% lower in smokers who were taking lamotrigine than in non-smokers who were taking lamotrigine. After adjusting for olanzapine dose and taking carbamazepine, the correction factor comparing smokers taking lamotrigine versus non-smokers who were not taking lamotrigine was 1.3. Gender, age, and concomitant use of mirtazapine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, topiramate, lorazepam, citalopram or oxcarbazepine did not have significant effects on olanzapine concentrations. The main limitation of this clinical design is the unavoidable substantial \"noise\" that characterizes (uncontrolled) clinical environments, which may make it difficult to detect the effects of some variables. Other limitations were the small sample size of some drug sub-samples and the lack of testing for plasma olanzapine metabolites.", 
    "149": "Whereas advances in the molecular biology of GABA(A) receptor complex using knock-out and knock-in mice have been valuable in unveiling the structure, composition, receptor assembly, and several functions of different GABA(A) receptor subtypes, the mechanism(s) underlying benzodiazepine (BZ) tolerance and withdrawal remain poorly understood. Studies using specific GABA(A) receptor subunit knock-in mice suggest that tolerance to sedative action of diazepam requires long-term activation of alpha1 and alpha5 GABA(A) receptor subunits. We investigated the role of long-term activation of these GABA(A) receptor subunits during anticonvulsant tolerance using high affinity and high intrinsic efficacy ligands for GABA(A) receptors expressing the alpha5 subunit (imidazenil) or alpha1 subunit (zolpidem), and a non-selective BZ recognition site ligand (diazepam). We report here that long-term activation of GABA(A) receptors by zolpidem and diazepam but not by imidazenil elicits anticonvulsant tolerance. Although anticonvulsant cross-tolerance occurs between diazepam and zolpidem, there is no cross-tolerance between imidazenil and diazepam or zolpidem. Furthermore, diazepam or zolpidem long-term treatment decreased the expression of mRNA encoding the alpha1 GABA(A) receptor subunit in prefrontal cortex by 43% and 20% respectively. In addition, diazepam but not zolpidem long-term treatment produced a 30% increase in the expression of the alpha5 GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA in prefrontal cortex. In contrast, imidazenil which is devoid of anticonvulsant tolerance does not elicit significant changes in the expression of alpha1 or alpha5 GABA(A) receptor subunit. These findings suggest that long-term activation of GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha1 or other subunits but not the alpha5 receptor subunit is essential for the induction of anticonvulsant tolerance.", 
    "150": "Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) describes an electroencephalographic pattern showing significant activation of epileptiform discharges in sleep. The terms continuous spike wave in slow-wave sleep (CSWS) and Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) describe the clinical epileptic syndromes seen with ESES. Although there is an overlap between these 2 syndromes, children with CSWS present with a more global regression have more problematic epilepsy and have EEG foci located predominantly in frontotemporal or frontocentral regions. In contrast, children with LKS present with an acquired auditory agnosia, fewer seizures, and EEG foci in the posterotemporal regions. ESES requires a high degree of clinical suspicion because slow-wave sleep must be recorded to confirm this diagnosis. Treatment of ESES extends beyond just control of the seizures; amelioration of the continuous epileptiform discharge must occur to improve neuropsychological outcome. Although there is little evidence to guide treatment, conventional antiepileptic drugs play only a minimal role. Steroid therapy and high-dose benzodiazepines are most commonly used, but other therapies including intravenous gamma-globulin, the ketogenic diet, and surgical therapy with multiple subpial transaction have shown efficacy in small case series. Although epilepsy resolves with time in most cases, many children are left with significant cognitive or language impairment. Longer duration of ESES appears to be the major predictor of poor outcome; markedly abnormal neuronal activity during a critical period for synaptogenesis may result in aberrant synapse formation, explaining the poorer neuropsychological outcome. Early recognition and effective therapy are necessary to improve long-term prognosis in this condition.", 
    "151": "Dysfunctional activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during working memory (WM) in schizophrenia patients has repeatedly been observed, however little is known about specific medication effects on the modulation of DLPFC activation. We measured activation of DLPFC during a WM task in a longitudinal fMRI study in ten schizophrenia patients first when they received conventional antipsychotics (T1) and a second time after they had been switched to olanzapine (T2). A healthy control group matched for age, handedness and gender was investigated at two corresponding time points. We analyzed the fMRI data with SPM5 in a 2 x 2 x 2 design (group x session x task). Schizophrenia patients showed fewer correct responses compared to healthy controls at both time points. The fMRI data revealed a significant group by task interaction in the bilateral DLPFC and the right parietal cortex, indicating a reduced BOLD response in the patient group. After switching to olanzapine, schizophrenia patients displayed a significant increase in the BOLD response during the 0-back condition in the DLPFC. This study showed that switching patients from conventional neuroleptics to olanzapine did not significantly alter the frontal or parietal BOLD response during working memory task. However, medication status had influences on the activation during attentional task (0-back), emphasizing the importance of baseline selection in pharmacological fMRI studies.", 
    "152": "Increasing experimental and clinical evidence suggests that abnormal glutamate transmission might play a major role in a vast number of neurological disorders. As a measure of glutamatergic excitation, we have studied the acetylcholine (ACh) release induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor stimulation in primary cultured rat ventral horn spinal neurons and we have evaluated the possibility to limit the consequences of the hyperactivation of glutamatergic receptors, by recruiting the inhibitory transmission mediated by GABA and glycine. For this purpose, we have exposed cell cultures, previously loaded with [(3)H]choline, to NMDA, which increased the spontaneous tritium efflux in a concentration-dependent manner. Tritium release is dependent upon external Ca(2+), tetrodotoxin, Cd(2+) ions and omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not on omega-conotoxin MVIIC nor nifedipine, suggesting the involvement of N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. NMDA-mediated [(3)H]ACh release was completely prevented by MK-801, 5,7-diclorokynurenic acid and ifenprodil, while it was strongly inhibited by a lower external pH, suggesting that the involved NMDA receptors contain NR1 and NR2B subunits. Muscimol inhibited NMDA-evoked [(3)H]ACh release and its effect was antagonized by SR95531 and potentiated by diazepam, indicating the involvement of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors. Also glycine, via strychnine-sensitive receptors, inhibited the effect of NMDA. It is concluded that glutamate acts on the NMDA receptors situated on spinal motoneurons to evoke ACh release, which can be inhibited through the activation of GABA(A) and glycine receptors present on the same neurons. These data suggest that glutamatergic overload of receptors located onto spinal cord motoneurons might be decreased by activating GABA(A) and glycine receptors.", 
    "153": "Research investigating how control over stressors affects behavior often utilizes freezing and shuttle escape learning as the behavioral endpoints. These endpoints have been argued to reflect anxious or depressed states, but these descriptions are problematic. The present study sought to determine the impact of stressor controllability and the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus (DRN) on sucrose preference and juvenile social exploration, putative measures of anhedonia and anxiety that are commonly used in studies of stress per se. In Experiment 1 rats were exposed to escapable stress (ES) or yoked-inescapable stress (IS) tailshocks. In Experiment 2 ES or IS was given 7 days before all rats received IS. In Experiment 3 the DRN was inactivated during IS by microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT. Sucrose preference and social exploration were tested for several days after stress. A fourth experiment confirmed that juvenile social exploration is sensitive to traditional beta-carboline and benzodiazepine manipulations. Both ES and IS reduced sucrose preference, but only IS reduced social exploration. Prior treatment with ES prevented the effect of IS on social exploration but did not prevent the effect of IS on sucrose preference and inactivation of the DRN prevented the effect of IS on social exploration but did not change sucrose preference. The present results indicate that social exploration but not sucrose preference is sensitive to prior stressor controllability, and that DRN activation mediates the effect of IS on social exploration. We argue that DRN-5-HT activation mediates a state of generalized anxiety produced by uncontrollable stress and that juvenile social exploration is a useful behavioral endpoint in stressor controllability studies.",

It has been hypothesized that these various pharmacological effects are mediated by different GABAA-R subtypes. If this hypothesis is correct, then it may be possible to develop compounds targeting particular GABAA-R subtypes as, for example, selective anxiolytics with a diminished side effect profile. The pyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyrimidine ocinaplon is anxioselective in both preclinical studies and in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, but does not exhibit the selectivity between alpha1/alpha2-containing receptors for an anxioselective that is predicted by studies using transgenic mice.",

The pharmacological properties of DOV 315,090 were assessed using radioligand binding studies and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. We report that DOV 315,090 possesses modulatory activity at GABAA-Rs, but that its selectivity profile is similar to that of ocinaplon.",

Thirty (14.4%) patients tolerated the procedure poorly and independent predictors included female gender (OR 2.93, 95% CI = 1.22 to 7.01) and a prolonged duration of procedure (OR 2.85, 95% CI = 1.08 to 7.48). Hypotension occurred in 13 (6.25%) patients, with age > 65 years as the only risk factor (OR 13.17, 95% CI = 1.28 to 137.92). A prolonged duration was the main cause of hypoxia (OR 5.49, 95% CI = 1.54 to 19.49), which occurred in 6 (2.88%) patients. No major complications occurred during the study period. The current practice of conscious sedation is safe and tolerated well by most adults in our population. However, poor tolerance in a notable minority may have significant clinical implications.",

Agitation and terminal restlessness, 2 common symptoms encountered in the hospice population, are frequently managed using benzodiazepines or typical antipsychotics. In clinical scenarios that either preclude their use or in which they prove ineffective, alternative pharmacotherapy must be considered. Propofol, a sedative-hypnotic unrelated to any other class of drug, may provide palliation of agitation and terminal restlessness refractory to benzodiazepines or antipsychotics. Here, the authors present a hospice patient admitted to the general medical floor of a small community hospital for pain and symptom management. A history of polysubstance abuse contributes to rapidly escalating doses of opioids and midazolam. Failure to control her symptoms resulted in the initiation and successful titration of propofol.",

AIMS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thus, this study evaluated the effect of acute and chronic (23-26 days) administrations of the hydroalcoholic extract of the stem bark of Erythrina velutina (orally) in mice submitted to the following tests: elevated plus-maze, forced swim, spontaneous locomotor activity, and habituation to active chamber. Chlordiazepoxide and imipramine were used as standard drugs.",

In the forced swim test, only imipramine (25mg/kg) decreased immobility time. Impairment of habituation was seen only with acute imipramine administration and with the lowest doses of Erythrina velutina extract tested in acute (10mg/kg) and chronic (50mg/kg) administrations.", 
    "188": "These results suggest that chronic administration of the hydroalcoholic extract of the stem bark of Erythrina velutina exerts an anxiolytic-like effect on mice, and it could serve as a new approach for the treatment anxiety, although it may have an amnesic effect at low doses.", 
    "189": "The cerebellum controls complex, coordinated, and rapid movements, a function requiring precise timing abilities. However, the network mechanisms that underlie the temporal organization of activity in the cerebellum are largely unexplored, because in vivo recordings have usually targeted single units. Here, we use tetrode and multisite recordings to demonstrate that Purkinje cell activity is synchronized by a high-frequency (approximately 200 Hz) population oscillation. We combine pharmacological experiments and modeling to show how the recurrent inhibitory connections between Purkinje cells are sufficient to generate these oscillations. A key feature of these oscillations is a fixed population frequency that is independent of the firing rates of the individual cells. Convergence in the deep cerebellar nuclei of Purkinje cell activity, synchronized by these oscillations, likely organizes temporally the cerebellar output.", 
    "190": "Many patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder experience disturbances in their sleep-wake cycle, which may be a result of the disorder itself, of pharmacotherapy, or of a comorbid sleep disorder. These sleep disruptions can seriously impair patients' functioning as well as their quality of life. Therefore, accurate assessment of sleep problems is essential to appropriately treat patients and promote symptomatic remission. Sedating antipsychotics may ameliorate sleep disturbances, as well as agitation or other behavioral emergencies; however, these agents may also sedate patients to the point of dissatisfaction with the medication and/or impaired functioning, which may, in turn, increase treatment noncompliance and nonadherence. Using short-term adjunctive medications, such as benzo-diazepines or hypnotic agents, with a nonsedating antipsychotic to alleviate sleep disturbances is a reasonable treatment option for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Overall, the pharma-cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atypical antipsychotics are important factors to consider in the risk-benefit analysis, as are dosing strategies and individual patient factors, and clinicians must decide which agents are most appropriate for which patients.", 
    "191": "RG-15 (trans-N-[4-[2-[4-(3-cyano-5-trifluoromethyl -phenyl) -piperazine -1 -yl] -ethyl] -cyclohexyl] -3 -pyridinesulfonic amide dihydro-chloride), is a highly selective dopamine D3/D2 receptor antagonist with subnanomolar affinity for the D3 receptor and nanomolar affinity for the D2 receptor. We found that RG-15 showed a good oral bioavailability (54%) and high brain levels (approx. 900 ng/g) in rats and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned avoidance response tests in rats, yielding ED50 (median effective dose) values of 8.6 and 12 mg/kg orally, respectively. At six- to eightfold higher doses, RG-15 blocked spontaneous motor activity, while a 30 mg/kg dose of the compound caused an increase in the home-cage motility of rats. The drug did not produce catalepsy up to 160 mg/kg oral dose; moreover, it inhibited haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the range 15-60 mg/kg. RG-15 (10 mg/kg orally) restored the impaired learning performance of scopolamine- or diazepam-treated rats in a water-labyrinth paradigm. It is assumed that the motor activating, anticataleptic and cognitive-enhancing properties of RG-15 result from its potent D3 antagonism. In this regard, RG 15 clearly differs from other antipsychotics. Olanzapine, clozapine and amisulpride all showed efficacy against amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and on conditioned avoidance, but compared to RG-15, they proved to be more cataleptogenic and depressed or did not change the home-cage activity of animals. Olanzapine was also inactive in the learning paradigm. Our results suggest that subnanomolar dopamine D3 receptor antagonism coupled to moderate D2 affinity may result in an antipsychotic profile characterised by a lack of extrapyramidal side effects and secondary negative symptoms with simultaneous efficacy on positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.", 
    "192": "Psychotic fear and anxiety disturbances are seen at a relatively high frequency in patients with schizophrenia. Atypical anti-psychotics are believed to show superior efficacy in reducing these symptoms. However, clinical and preclinical evidence regarding their anxiolytic efficacy has been mixed. In this study, we evaluated the possible anxiolytic property of two atypicals clozapine and olanzapine and compared them with typical haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide (a prototype of sedative-anxiolytic drug) in two preclinical models of fear. In Experiment 1, we used a fear-induced passive avoidance and conditioned place aversion paradigm and examined the effects of clozapine (20 mg/kg, sc), haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, sc) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/ kg, ip). In Experiments 2 and 3, we used a two-way active avoidance conditioning paradigm and further compared the effects of clozapine (20 mg/kg, sc), haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, sc), chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, ip) and three doses of olanzapine (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg, sc). Results show that clozapine and chlordiazepoxide, but not haloperidol, significantly attenuated the shock conditioning-induced place aversion, decreased the amount of defecations and the number of the 22-kHz vocalizations. Clozapine also reduced the shock conditioning-induced hyperthermia. Similar to clozapine, olanzapine also significantly decreased the amount of defecations and reduced the shock conditioning-induced hyperthermia, but it did not inhibit the 22-kHz vocalizations. This study demonstrates that clozapine and olanzapine possess an intrinsic anxiolytic property, which is not attributable to its superior anti-\"psychotic\" effect or its favorable effects on motor functions or learning and memory processes. These findings also suggest that the combined use of passive avoidance and active avoidance conditioning models can be useful in better differentiating typical and atypical anti-psychotics as well as anxiolytics.",

    "214": "Cytochrome P450 (P450) is a super-family of drug metabolizing enzymes. P450 enzymes have dual function; they can metabolize drugs to pharmacologically inactive metabolites facilitating their excretion or biotransform them to pharmacologically active metabolites which may have longer half-life than the parent drug. The variable pharmacological response to psychoactive drugs typically seen in population groups is often not accountable by considering dissimilarities in hepatic metabolism. Metabolism in brain specific nuclei may play a role in pharmacological modulation of drugs acting on the CNS and help explain some of the diverse response to these drugs seen in patient population. P450 enzymes are also present in brain where drug metabolism can take place and modify therapeutic action of drugs at the site of action. We have earlier demonstrated an intrinsic difference in the biotransformation of alprazolam (ALP) in brain and liver, relatively more alpha-hydroxy alprazolam (alpha-OHALP) is formed in brain as compared to liver. In the present study we show that recombinant CYP3A43 metabolizes ALP to both alpha-OHALP and 4-hydroxy alprazolam (4-OHALP) while CYP3A4 metabolizes ALP predominantly to its inactive metabolite, 4-OHALP. The expression of CYP3A43 mRNA in human brain samples correlates with formation of relatively higher levels of alpha-OH ALP indicating that individuals who express higher levels of CYP3A43 in the brain would generate larger amounts of alpha-OHALP. Further, the expression of CYP3A43 was relatively higher in brain as compared to liver across different ethnic populations. Since CYP3A enzymes play a prominent role in the metabolism of drugs, the higher expression of CYP3A43 would generate metabolite profile of drugs differentially in human brain and thus impact the pharmacodynamics of psychoactive drugs at the site of action.",

A total of 312 patients were switched to an 8-week, open-label, flexible dose (40-160 mg/day) of ziprasidone. Psychiatric status was evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impression Severity scale. Other measures included functioning, subjective response and attitude toward therapy, and cognition. Laboratory tests and electrocardiography with QTc interval were carried out. Extrapyramidal symptoms and sexual dysfunction symptoms were also assessed. Of the 312 enrolled patients, 73.1% completed the study. Olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol were the most common psychotropic drugs taken before entry. Poor efficacy was the main reason for change in therapy.

Patients were defined as those who (1) started olanzapine at baseline and changed treatment; (2) started another antipsychotic at baseline and changed to olanzapine; and (3) changed from and to a non-olanzapine antipsychotic. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the impact of switching on treatment response and tolerability. Patients switching from olanzapine were less likely to respond than patients switching to olanzapine (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.87). Patients who switched from olanzapine and those who switched neither from nor to olanzapine were more likely to have extrapyramidal symptoms (OR: 3.79; 95% CI: 2.02, 7.10 and OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.23, 3.86, respectively) and loss of libido (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.96 and OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.35, respectively) compared with patients who switched from another antipsychotic to olanzapine.

    "221": "To investigate a newly developed quinolone antibiotics, the effect of antofloxacin hydrochloride on cytochrome P450 isoforms in rats was examined. A cocktail approach was adopted. Theophylline (CYP1A2), midazolam (CYP3A), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), omeprazole (CYP2C19) and diclofenac (CYP2C9) were used as probes in the study, and own control was adopted. In Protocol 1, probes were given to rats simultaneously by co-administration with antofloxacin. The blood samples were obtained at designated time, and plasma concentrations of the six probes were determined by LC-MS. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and compared in experimental groups in the absence and presence of antofloxacin. The result showed that the presence of antofloxacin resulted in a significant increase in theophylline values of AUC0-T and t1/2 (PAUC0-T = 0.0004 vs control Pt1/2 = 0.005 vs control), indicating that antofloxacin delayed the clearance of theophylline. In Protocol 2, the probes' pharmacokinetic parameters were compared in rats that received six probes before and after 14.5 days of consecutive administration of antofloxacin (15 mg x kg(-1), given orally, twice daily). The results suggested that the AUC0-T of chlorzoxazone was significantly decreased (P = 0.024), while that of dextromethorphan was significantly increased (P = 0.027). In conclusion, these results indicated that antofloxacin may inhibit the activity of CYP1A2, thus delaying the clearance of its substrates, and may have a slight inhibitory effect on CYP2D6 as well as an inductive effect on CYP2E1 following chronic administration.",

The same type of sedation, regardless of the regional block performed, is used by 49.2% of respondents, and 64.3% use a scale to evaluate the level of sedation. The most favored sedation technique is continuous infusion, followed by target controlled infusion and boluses on demand. The most commonly used technique is sedation with bolus injections.

In this cohort, the median lorazepam infusion rate was 2.1 mg/h (0.5-18). Propylene glycol concentration correlated poorly with osmolality, osmol gap, and lactate. In all, 8 patients (16%) had significant propylene glycol accumulation (>25mg/dL). When propylene glycol concentrations were >25 mg/dL, the median lorazepam infusion rate before sample collection was higher, 6.4 (1.9-11.3) versus 2.0 (0.5-7.4) mg/h (P =.0003).

C.) and 30 min per os before bicuculline exerted significant anticonvulsant activity in the bicuculline-induced seizure threshold test in mice. In vitro, potato juice from different harvests at dilution series from 10 % to 0.000001 %, diluted 100,000-fold, displaced 50 % of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor ligand [ (3)H]GABA and diluted 40-fold displaced 50 % of [(3)H]flunitrazepam from binding sites in mice forebrain membranes. The low content of diazepam (0.04 +/- 0.01 mg/kg) determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry in the potato extracts could not sustain the anticonvulsant activity of potato juice in vivo; therefore we hypothesized that potato juice might contain GABA (A) receptor GABA-site active compounds.

The pharmacy department subsequently examined its processes as they related to the two medications, and changes were implemented in the areas of order processing and floor-stock provision. Before policy implementation, injectable olanzapine was stored as floor stock in several automated medication cabinets for use in urgent situations. Injectable lorazepam was also included in the stock inventory for most patient care areas. After policy implementation, intramuscular olanzapine was removed from the general floor stock on all hospital units. The drug is now only available after a pharmacist's review and approval of each individual order. Upon receipt of an order for intramuscular olanzapine, the pharmacist is required to conduct a prospective review of the individual patient's medication profile to determine if an active order for an injectable benzodiazepine exists.

In general, the affinity of the 3-acyl derivatives was found to be comparable with the 3-carboxylate and the 3-carboxamide derivatives, and certain substituents (e.g., benzyl) in position 6 were again shown to be important. As it is believed that the benzodiazepine binding site is situated between an alpha- and a gamma-subunit in the GABA(A) receptor, selected compounds were tested on the alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s), alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2s) and alpha(3)beta(2)gamma(2s) GABA(A) receptor subtypes. The 3-acyl-4-quinolones display various degrees of selectivity for alpha(1)- versus alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-containing receptors, and high-affinity ligands essentially selective for alpha(1) over alpha(3) were developed.", 
    "232": "It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of treatments in lowering suicide incidence.", 
    "233": "To ascertain the impact of antidepressants (AD) on suicidal behavior, we compared the psychopharmacological treatment taken in the previous 3 months by cases who had made or not a suicide attempt (SA) just before their admission to a hospital.", 
    "234": "In comparison with not SA cases, SA cases were more likely to have received AD and benzodiazepines (BZD) before hospitalization. On the contrary, they were less likely to have received antipsychotics, antiepileptic mood stabilizers, and lithium. Similar results were observed when the analysis was restricted to cases with a diagnosis of Major Depression, Bipolar Depression or Bipolar Mixed state, Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive or Mixed type. Previous AD treatment seemed to be not related to the severity of psychopathology in general or to the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.", 
    "235": "The results suggest that the use of AD in patients with mood disorders is not associated with a reduction of SA rate. Rather, it is not possible to exclude that AD or BZD can induce, worsen, or precipitate suicidal behavior in some patients, especially in those affected by mood disorders with Depressive or Mixed features. The results must be considered preliminary since this is an open, non-randomized, non-controlled study that was carried out at a single facility.", 
    "236": "To see how dominance in adult communication and child behaviour during premedication affects the child's unwillingness to take premedication.", 
    "237": "Ninety-five children scheduled for ENT surgery were video-filmed during premedication. All communication was translated verbatim and the communication was grouped according to; if the parent or nurse directed their communication towards the child or not, or; if they talked about nonprocedural matters or procedural matters.", 
    "238": "Unwillingness to take premedication was associated with more parent communication and less anaesthetic nurse communication compared to willingness to take premedication. There was a heighten risk that the child took their premedication unwillingly if their parent talked more directly to the child (OR = 4.9, p < or = 0.01), the child gave hesitant eye contact with the anaesthetic nurse (OR = 4.5, p < or = 0.05), the child had experienced an earlier traumatic medical procedure (OR = 4.1. p < or = 0.001) or if the child placed her/himself nearby their parent (OR = 4.0, p < or = 0.001).", 
    "239": "Together with behaviour that could be signs of shyness and earlier medical traumatic experience, parents that are actively communicating with their child before premedication may heighten the risk that the child will take the premedication unwillingly.", 
    "240": "Olanzapine (OLAN), an atypical antipsychotic medication with mixed 5-HT2/DA antagonist properties, was predicted to dose-dependently decrease urge to smoke, withdrawal, and cigarette reinforcement in smokers without psychosis. A double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects cross-over trial investigated the acute effects of OLAN (0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg; counterbalanced order) in 24 community smokers who underwent 10-hr smoking deprivation. Urge to smoke, tobacco withdrawal, and cigarette reinforcement were assessed with cue reactivity and behavioral choice procedures. OLAN (2.5 mg) reduced withdrawal symptoms before and during cue exposure and decreased urge associated with anticipated positive affect from smoking before and during cue exposure; 5.0 mg OLAN decreased withdrawal only when cues were included. OLAN did not affect preference for cigarette puffs versus money, smoke intake, or urge to smoke associated with negative affect relief. The results indicate a potentially beneficial effect of 2.5 mg OLAN on tobacco withdrawal and urge to smoke. Combined 5HT/DA antagonists should be considered for future development of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation.", 
    "241": "As the number of elderly patients undergoing surgery continues to rise, it is important to consider anaesthetic options that minimize physiological stress in these patients. Monitored anaesthesia care (MAC), or sedation and monitoring during surgery, is an attractive option for certain common procedures. However, those administering MAC must consider the normal decline in functional reserve in patients aged >70 years. This includes loss of normal compensation for the stress of hypovolaemia, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, altered mental status and reduced response to hypoxia and hypercarbia associated with the perioperative and sedated state in this population. In addition, vigilance is necessary to identify co-morbid states, which increase in incidence with age and often present atypically. Elderly patients have increased sensitivity to all sedatives and opioids (doubled by age 80 years, quadrupled by age 90 years with benzodiazepines). As a result of changes in body composition, as well as senescence of renal and hepatic function, the time to onset and offset of even short-acting sedatives will be prolonged. There is also extreme variability in the response to sedatives among these patients. Anaesthetic dosing should be in smaller increments in the elderly, boluses reduced by half and infusions reduced by as much as two-thirds. Caution must be exercised through full monitoring of intra-operative and postoperative mental status, oxygenation and perfusion states. Pain is best treated using smaller doses in a multimodal regimen, the aim being to reduce adverse effects while ensuring adequate pain relief. In this way, a huge range of procedures can be safely performed in our aging population with expectations for a full and early return to baseline functional status.", 
    "242": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of sevoflurane on spontaneous brain bioelectrical activity in neurosurgical patients. Forty patients treated at the Research Institute of Neurosurgery underwent a neurophysiological examination. No epileptic syndrome was revealed in the clinical picture in 10 patients (a control group), the remaining 30 patients had a history of varying epileptic seizures of different degrees and frequency. Sevoflurane causes a relative acceleration of epileptiform activity synchronization, as evidenced by EEG, which is not a contraindication to the use of this drug in patients with cerebral organic lesion of various genesis with a history of epileptic syndrome and fails to induce clinically significant EEG epileptiform manifestations in patients without epilepsy. In patients with cerebrovascular abnormalities (arteriovenous malformation, cavernous angiomas) who have a history of paroxysmal conditions, inhalational sevoflurane anesthesia can be performed in combination with anticonvulsants (benzodiazepines) during an operation."
