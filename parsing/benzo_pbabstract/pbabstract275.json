    "0": "The objective of this article was to examine the possible association between benzodiazepine use and the risk of dementia in the elderly. This was a nested case--control study set in community settings in Bordeaux area, France. The participants were a representative sample of 3,777 elderly persons (65 years of age and older) followed from 1989 to 1997. The main outcome measures were the use of benzodiazepines in incident cases of dementia versus nondemented controls. On the basis of medical and psychological data, 150 patients were diagnosed with dementia according to the criteria of the third revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Information on benzodiazepine use was obtained by face-to-face interview and visual assessment of patient's medicine chest by a trained neuropsychologist. After controlling for age, gender, education level, living alone, wine consumption, psychiatric history, and depressive symptomatology, ever use of benzodiazepines was associated with a significantly increased risk of dementia [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.4]. Former use was associated with a significantly increased risk of dementia (adjusted OR, 2.3; 95% CI,1.2-4.5). No association was found between dementia and the current use of benzodiazepines (adjusted OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.6). Our finding suggest that former use of benzodiazepines could be a risk factor for dementia, but more detailed investigation are needed.", 
    "1": "Benzodiazepine pharmacology at the GABA(A) receptor is dependent on the alpha and gamma subunit isoforms present. Ligands with higher affinity for certain isoforms--selective compounds--have been classified into benzodiazepine type I and II and into diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive receptors. A single amino acid position (alpha1G201/alpha3E225) has been identified which discriminates BZI and BZII receptors. The role of this residue has been explored by mutagenesis of alpha1 position 201 and the pharmacology of recombinant receptors examined using BZI receptor agonists. Ligand affinity is reduced by increasing side chain volume at alpha1G201 suggesting that steric inhibition underlies alpha-subunit selectivity. A second amino acid (alpha1H102/alpha6R100) determines diazepam sensitivity. The nature of the amino acid at this position was also examined by mutagenesis. Flumazenil and Ro15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) binding affinity correlated weakly with the amino acid hydrophobicity suggesting a weak hydrophobic interaction between the ligand and alpha1H102.", 
    "2": "A liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) assay was developed and validated to quantitatively determine olanzapine (OLZ) concentrations in human blood. Liquid-liquid extraction, using n-butanol:cyclohexane (3:47, v/v), was used to isolate OLZ and its internal standard, LY170158, from the biological matrix. Chromatographic resolution of OLZ from endogenous interferences and known metabolites was accomplished with a MetaChem Monochrom HPLC column (4.6 x 150 mm, d(p) 5 microm). Detection occurred using a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API III Plus triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using positive ion APCI and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The linear dynamic range was from 5 to 500 ng ml(-1) based on a 0.25-ml aliquot of human blood. The inter-day precision (%RSD) and accuracy (%RE) ranged from 3.65 to 10.64 and from -2.14 to 3.07, respectively. Modifications to an existing assay for the determination of OLZ in human plasma were necessary. A different structural analog was used as the internal standard due to instability observed for the original analog when using human blood as the matrix. A second modification was the addition of the anti-oxidant sodium ascorbate to inhibit degradation of OLZ in human blood, as has been noted by other investigators. Upon fortification of human blood with sodium ascorbate (final concentration, 0.33 mM), OLZ was found to be stable for at least 1 week at -70 degrees C as well as through two freeze-thaw cycles. This assay, which will be used to investigate the distribution of OLZ in human blood, grants insight into the proper sample handling conditions needed to perform valid determinations of OLZ in human blood.", 
    "3": "Midazolam conscious sedation records of pediatric dental patients, one to six years of age, were reviewed retrospectively to: 1) examine the factors associated with the use of oral and nasal routes of administration and their effect on displayed behavior during dental treatment and 2) determine whether a child's compliance with oral administration is predictive of the intraoperative behavior displayed during dental treatment. Two hundred and fifty-seven conscious sedation records for 222 pediatric dental patients sedated with orally or nasally administered midazolam for dental treatment at the University of Florida were reviewed. Data collected included the patient's age, gender, route of administration, dose, compliance with oral administration, appointment type (planned vs. emergency), previous sedation experience with midazolam, operator vs. parent administration of the medication, use of papoose board and nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation, types of procedures performed (restorations only, extractions only, or both), length of treatment rendered, and preoperative and intraoperative behavioral assessments of the child. The collected data were analyzed with Statview software using ANOVA and Chi-square analyses. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between oral and nasal administration for the parameters of age, procedure length, appointment type, procedures performed, previous sedation experience and use of the papoose board and nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation. While there was no statistically significant influence of chronological age on the preoperative Frankl behavior ratings, there was a statistically significant mean age difference with respect to the administrator of the medication (parent vs. operator), papoose board use, N2O/O2 use and previous sedation experience. Forty-five percent of the subjects were willing to accept oral administration of the medication, however, there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.114) between the child's compliance to accept the medication and the intraoperative Frankl behavioral ratings displayed during dental treatment. In this review of midazolam conscious sedation records of pediatric dental patients. 1) route of administration was significantly influenced by several patient and procedural variables, resulting in different behavioral outcomes and 2) compliance with oral administration was not predictive of behavior displayed during treatment.", 
    "4": "Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent with a chemical structure of imidazopyridine. In vitro and in vivo binding studies, zolpidem exhibits selectivity to omega 1 receptors (GABAA-receptor subtypes containing alpha 1 subunits). Unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem produces sedative effects in preference to anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and myorelaxant effects in behavioral experiments using mice. Double-blind comparative studies with reference drugs such as triazolam and zopiclone show that zolpidem is an effective and highly safe drug for the treatment of insomnia. In addition, zolpidem does not produce next-day residual effects, rebound insomnia and tolerance. This clinical profile of zolpidem may be related to its selectivity and high intrinsic activity for omega 1 receptors.", 
    "5": "As an analogue of pyridazino-fused ring systems with pharmacological activities, the novel pyridazinol[3,4-b][1,5]diazepine ring system was prepared. The synthetic pathway includes three steps from 4 5-(N-benzyl-N-3-hydroxypropyl)amino derivative which is easily available through nucleophilic substitution reaction of the known 4,5-dichloro-2-methyl-6-nitro-3(2H)-pyridazinone (2) with N-benzyl-N-(3-hydroxypropyl)amine. In the first step, compound 4 was treated with thionyl chloride to give the chloropropyl derivative 5. In the second step, a Bechamp reduction was carried out with Fe in acetic acid to obtain the amino compound 6, and finally the ring closure reaction of 6 was performed in N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of potassium carbonate at 110 degrees C for 40 hours. In this way the bicyclic compound 7 could be isolated in 48% yield.", 
    "6": "Status epilepticus is one of the most common neurologic emergencies in children, adolescents, and young adults. The advantage of diazepam suppository in medicinal therapy appears mainly in treatment of childhood epilepsy. A hydrophilic suppository base was investigated in solution by dynamic light scattering and results were compared to those of the membrane diffusion experiments measuring diazepam solubilization. According to the dynamic laser light scattering photometric measurements, the good solubilization effect of the macrogol mixture (5% Polysorbatum 20, 10% Macrogolum 400, 85% Macrogolum 1540) is explained by the formation of small, tight micellas. As the Polysorbatum 20 tenside resulted in the significant decrease (p < 0.05) of the formation of great micellas, its use led to the formation of small, tight, almost monodisperse micellas of 40-50 nm in the aqueous solution of the macrogol mixture.", 
    "7": "Previous findings indicate that the acoustic startle response is elevated when rats are tested in bright light. The phenomenon is disrupted by the 5HT1A partial agonist and the D2 receptor antagonist buspirone, a compound that also blocks the effect on startle of conditioned fear, and it was suggested that light-enhanced startle reflects an anxious state produced by bright light. It was also suggested that pre-test handling may be necessary for light-enhanced startle. To characterize this phenomenon further, we evaluate here the sensitivity of light-enhanced startle to the anxiolytic compound chlordiazepoxide, to the noradrenergic beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, and to pre-test handling.", 
    "8": "Startle was measured for 20 min in the dark (phase I), followed 5 min later by a second test (phase II) either in the dark or the light. Immediately prior to testing, rats received IP injections of chlordiazepoxide (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg; experiment 1), propranolol (10 or 20 mg/kg; experiment 2) or saline. Using the minimally effective doses from the light-enhanced startle experiments, conditioned fear to a shock-paired cue was also evaluated. In a third experiment, rats were (a) removed from the test cages and briefly handled between phases I and II, (b) were not handled during this interval, or (c) were tested without the interposed delay.", 
    "9": "Propranolol (10 and 20 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) disrupted light-enhanced startle at doses comparable to those required to disrupt fear-potentiated startle to a shock-paired cue. There was no effect of handling.", 
    "10": "These results further characterize the pharmacology of light-enhanced startle, provide additional support for the view that the effects of light on startle reflect an influence of anxiety, and offer additional information concerning the procedural variables that influence this behavior.", 
    "11": "Preliminary unpublished studies in our laboratory suggested that the behaviour of Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Dark Agouti (DA) rats was markedly different on both the elevated plus maze and in the open-field apparatus. We wished to confirm and extend this initial finding.", 
    "12": "The study was designed to examine the behaviour of SD and DA rats in the elevated plus maze, open-field apparatus and automated activity meters. The response of both strains on the elevated plus maze following diazepam (1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) administration was subsequently investigated.", 
    "13": "DA rats showed markedly greater anxiety-like behaviour than SD rats in both the plus maze and open field, with fewer percentage open/total arm entries and percentage time spent on open/total arms in the plus maze and fewer crossings in the open field. Acute handling plus administration of vehicle abolished this difference in anxiety levels, with DA rats showing similar open-arm behaviour to that of SD rats. Both strains demonstrated a clear anxiolytic response to diazepam (1 mg/kg) in terms of percentage time spent on the open arms, but only SD rats had a statistically significant increase in percentage open-arm entries compared with vehicle-injected control animals.", 
    "14": "While the high level of anxiety-like behaviour of DA rats versus SD rats could prove useful in future ethological studies on anxiety, the fact that acute handling decreased the anxiety-like behaviour on the elevated plus maze may limit the value of this strain for the study of putative anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "15": "Recently, a new putative animal model of anxiety, \"light-enhanced startle\" was introduced. By placing a rat in a brightly lit environment, which is a naturally aversive stimulus to rats, the amplitude of the startle response to a startle-eliciting noise burst is increased.", 
    "16": "The present study aimed to determine the predictive validity of the light-enhanced startle as a putative model for anxiety.", 
    "17": "The effects of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP), the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan and the specific 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine on light-enhanced startle were studied.", 
    "18": "Both CDP and flesinoxan decreased startle potentiation, whereas fluvoxamine was devoid of any effects on potentiation. Effects on baseline startle amplitude were only seen after CDP administration.", 
    "19": "The present experiment provides evidence for the predictive validity of the light-enhanced startle as an animal model for anxiety. Due to the use of an unconditioned anxiogenic stimulus, the light-enhanced startle offers several benefits over animal models that depend on conditioning. Drug effects can be ascribed more directly to effects on anxiety, as opposed to memory retrieval and, as shown in this study, non-specific drug effects can easily be detected without the interference of contextual fear.", 
    "20": "The present study examined how daily treatment with the benzodiazepine (BZ) diazepam modifies the effects of positive modulators acting at different sites on the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor complex and negative modulators acting at BZ sites on the receptor complex. GABA(A) modulators were administered alone or in combination with acute or chronic diazepam to rhesus monkeys (n = 4) responding under a multiple fixed ratio (FR/FR) schedule of food presentation and stimulus-shock termination (SST). There was mutual antagonism between the rate-decreasing effects of diazepam (5.6 mg/kg, p.o.) and high efficacy BZ site negative modulators [ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE), methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl-6,7-dimethoxyl-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)]. Antagonism of beta-CCE, beta-CCM, and DMCM by diazepam was markedly reduced in monkeys receiving diazepam daily. In contrast, daily diazepam treatment enhanced the rate-decreasing effects of Ro 15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and flumazenil. Chronic diazepam elicited cross-tolerance to the BZ triazolam and not to the barbiturate pentobarbital or the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone. These results suggest that tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of BZs is not accompanied by cross-tolerance to positive GABA(A) modulators acting at other sites on the receptor complex. Moreover, changes in sensitivity to negative GABA(A) modulators during chronic diazepam treatment appeared to be related to negative efficacy and not clearly related to the precipitation of withdrawal for all drugs. These results indicate that changes in sensitivity to the behavioral effects of drugs that act at different sites on the GABA(A) receptor complex might be especially useful for identifying and characterizing the functional consequences of GABA(A) receptor heterogeneity.", 
    "21": "A self-rating version of the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale has been developed. The present study examines the agreement between patients' self-assessment of side effects and the attending clinicians' ratings. The patient sample consisted of 63 patients with schizophrenia under maintenance treatment with risperidone, clozapine or classical antipsychotics. Approximately two thirds of the patients used concomitant medication with e.g. benzodiazepines, SSRIs, anticholinergics. Most inter-correlations between scores for single, corresponding items, subscores of Psychic, Neurological, Autonomic and Other side effects, as well as the Total Score from the patient version of the UKU Side Effect Self Rating Scale (UKU-SERS-Pat) and the clinician version (UKU-SERS-Clin) were found to be statistically significant. Patients reported side effects more frequently and or rated symptoms more severe than the clinicians. The results support the validity of the SERS-Pat and suggest that patient rated side effects may provide important clinical information not detected by clinician rated interviews. Such information can be utilised both in clinical investigations, in development of treatment programs and for individual patients in clinical practice.", 
    "22": "The medical management of aggressive and violent behaviour is a critical situation for which there is little evidence. In order to prepare for a randomised trial, due to start in the psychiatric emergency rooms of Rio de Janeiro in 2001, a survey of current practice was necessary.", 
    "23": "A seven day survey of pharmacological management of aggressive people with psychosis in the emergency rooms of all four public psychiatric hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.", 
    "24": "In one hospital data were not available. Of the 764 people with psychosis attending these ERs, 74 were given IM medication for rapid tranquillisation (9.7%, 2.1/week/100,000). A haloperidol-promethazine mix (with or without other drugs) was used for the majority of patients (83%).", 
    "25": "The haloperidol-promethazine mix, given intramuscularly for rapid tranquilization, is prevalent in Rio, where it is considered both safe and efficient. However, scientific evaluation of all pharmacological approaches to rapid tranquilization of psychotic people is inadequate or incomplete and a randomized trial of IM haloperidol-promethazine is overdue.", 
    "26": "The prefrontal cortex receives a major dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area, which plays an important role in the integration of neuronal signals influencing behavioural responses to stressful environmental stimuli. The dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) is expressed at highest levels in the prefrontal cortex and is the predominant D2-like receptor localized in this brain area. To investigate the functional significance of D4Rs in dopamine-mediated responses we have analysed a strain of mice lacking this receptor subtype (Drd4-/-). Wild-type and Drd4-/- mice were challenged in two different approach/avoidance conflict paradigms: the elevated plus maze and the light/dark preference exploration test. By these behavioural measures Drd4-/- mice showed heightened avoidance to the more fear-provoking areas of each maze as demonstrated by reduced exploration of the open arms of the plus maze and longer latencies to explore the illuminated compartment of the light/dark shuttle box. These exaggerated avoidance behaviours were further enhanced by an additional handling stress but completely prevented by anxiolytic agents such as the benzodiazepine midazolam and ethanol. Although Drd4-/- mice displayed heightened anxiety, they exhibited normal ethanol preference and consumption in a two-bottle choice test. Learned fear responses evaluated by contextual, cued and instrumental fear-conditioning tests showed no difference between wild-type and Drd4-/- mice. Taken together these results indicate that the absence of D4Rs increases avoidance behaviour to unconditioned stimuli and does not impair behavioural reactions to Pavlovian fear-conditioning, suggesting that the D4R could play a key role in the dopaminergic modulation of cortical signals triggered by environmental stimuli.",

    "28": "The sample comprised 735 people seeking treatment for drug misuse problems, who were current (last 90 days) drinkers.", 
    "29": "Data were collected by structured face-to-face interviews. Dependence upon illicit drugs and upon alcohol was measured by the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS).", 
    "30": "Three groups of drinkers were identified: non-alcohol-dependent drug misusers (63%); low-dependence (19%); and high-dependence (18%). Many drug misusers were drinking excessively and alcohol dependence was related to patterns of alcohol and drug consumption. High-dependence drinkers were more likely to drink extra-strength beer; they were less frequent users of heroin and crack cocaine but more frequent users of benzodiazepines, amphetamines and cocaine powder; they reported more psychological and physical health problems. The SDS was found to have good reliability and validity as a measure of alcohol dependence. SDS scores for alcohol and drug dependence were unrelated.", 
    "31": "Alcohol use is an important and under-rated problem in the treatment of drug misusers. A comprehensive assessment of alcohol use among drug misusers should include separate assessments of alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems and severity of alcohol dependence.", 
    "32": "The administration of dynorphin A(1-17), Dyn, intrathecally (i.t.) or of nociceptin, intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) produces antianalgesic actions against i.t. morphine in the tail flick test in mice. The antianalgesic action of nociceptin is mediated by spinal PGE2 and attenuated by i.t. PGD2 or indomethacin. The Dyn response is mediated by release of IL1beta in the spinal cord to activate an ascending pathway to the brain and in turn releases IL1beta in the brain which activates a descending pathway to the spinal cord. The present work investigated the possibility that the action of IL1beta in the Dyn system might release prostaglandins so that the Dyn and nociceptin antianalgesic systems would overlap at these points. The results indicated that in the Dyn system neither the IL1beta in the spinal cord or brain implicated prostaglandin release because i.t. and i.c.v. PGD2 and indomethacin did not affect Dyn-induced antianalgesia. In addition, nociceptin-induced antianalgesia did not involve components in the Dyn system. Thus, the Dyn and nociceptin antianalgesic systems did not overlap and each were independent systems.",

    "37": "We show that information flow through the adult cerebellar cortex, from the mossy fiber input to the Purkinje cell output, is controlled by furosemide-sensitive, diazepam- and neurosteroid-insensitive GABA(A) receptors on granule cells, which are activated both tonically and by GABA spillover from synaptic release sites. Tonic activation of these receptors contributes a 3-fold larger mean inhibitory conductance than GABA released synaptically by high-frequency stimulation. Tonic and spillover inhibition reduce the fraction of granule cells activated by mossy fiber input, generating an increase of coding sparseness, which is predicted to improve the information storage capacity of the cerebellum.", 
    "38": "Midazolam (MDZ) oxidation by recombinant CYP3A4 purified from Escherichia coli and 30 mutants generated at 15 different substrate recognition site positions has been studied to determine the role of individual residues in regioselectivity and to investigate the possible existence of multiple binding sites. Initial results showed that oxidation of MDZ by CYP3A4 causes time- and concentration-dependent enzyme inactivation with K(I) and k(inact) values of 5.8 microM and 0.15 min(-1), respectively. The different time courses of MDZ hydroxylation by mutants that predominantly formed 1'-OH MDZ as opposed to 4-OH MDZ provided strong evidence that the 1'-OH MDZ pathway leads to CYP3A4 inactivation. Correlational analysis of 1'-OH formation versus 4-OH formation by the mutants supports the inference that the two metabolites result from the binding of MDZ at two separate sites. Thus, substitution of residues Phe-108, Ile-120, Ile-301, Phe-304, and Thr-309 with a larger amino acid caused an increase in the ratio of 1'-OH/4-OH MDZ formation, whereas substitution of residues Ser-119, Ile-120, Leu-210, Phe-304, Ala-305, Tyr-307, and Thr-309 with a smaller amino acid decreased this ratio. Kinetic analyses of nine key mutants revealed that the alteration in regioselectivity is caused by a change in kinetic parameters (V(max) and K(M)) for the formation of both metabolites in most cases. The study revealed the role of various active-site residues in the regioselectivity of MDZ oxidation, identified the metabolic pathway that leads to enzyme inactivation, and provided an indication that the two proposed MDZ binding sites in CYP3A4 may be partially overlapping.", 
    "39": "The existing procedures for quantitative in vitro-in vivo clearance prediction can be significantly biased either by totally neglecting the existing variability and uncertainty by using mean parameter values or by implementing Monte Carlo simulation with statistical distribution of the parameters reconstructed from very small sets of data. The aim of the present study is to develop a methodology for the prediction of in vivo hepatic clearance in the presence of semiquantitative or qualitative data and accounting for the existing uncertainty and variability. The method consists of two steps: 1) transformation of the information available into fuzzy sets (fuzzification); and 2) computation of the in vivo clearance using arithmetic operations with fuzzy sets. To illustrate the approach, rat hepatocyte and microsomal data for eight benzodiazepine compounds are used. A comparison with a standard Monte Carlo procedure is made. The methodology proposed can be used when Monte Carlo simulation may be biased or cannot be implemented. The obtained fuzzy in vivo clearance can be used subsequently in fuzzy simulations of pharmacokinetic models.", 
    "40": "Acetylcholine (ACh), a major neurotransmitter from the autonomic nervous system, regulates the cholinergic stimulation of insulin secretion, through interactions with muscarinic receptors. The present study has characterised the individual involvement of muscarinic receptor subtypes in ACh-induced insulin secretion, using clonal beta cells and selective muscarinic receptor antagonists. BRIN BD11 cells clearly expressed mRNA encoding m1--m4 whereas m5 was not detected by RT-PCR. Insulin release was measured from BRIN BD11 cells treated with ACh in the presence of muscarinic receptor antagonists at concentrations ranging from 3 nM to 1 microM. 300 nM of muscarinic toxin-3 (M4 antagonist) and 1 microM of methoctramine (M2 antagonist) increased ACh (100 microM) stimulated insulin secretion by 168% and 50% respectively (ANOVA, P<0.05). The antagonists alone had no effect on insulin secretion. In contrast, 300 nM of pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) and 30 nM of hexahydro-sila-difenidol p-fluorohydrochloride (M3 antagonist) inhibited ACh stimulation by 91% and 84% respectively (ANOVA, P<0.01). It is concluded that ACh acts on different receptor subtypes producing both a stimulatory and an inhibitory action on insulin release.",

Causes of distress in these patients include: pain, sleep deprivation, anxiety, psychosis, agitation, and delirium. Drugs used to alleviate these stressors are opiates, benzodiazepines, neuromuscular blocking agents, anesthetic induction agents, and inhalational agents. When caring for the agitated patient on the mechanical ventilator, physiologic, mechanical, and emotional causes must all be investigated. Finally, nonpharmacologic therapy is of utmost importance in the care of these patients.", 
    "42": "Norwegian drugged drivers with benzodiazepine (BZD) detections have been studied with regard to drug use pattern and rearrest rate. During 1995, 3343 drivers were apprehended by the police in Norway due to the suspicion of influence by drugs. Blood samples from all drivers were sent to the National Institute of Forensic Toxicology (NIFT). The samples were analysed using a standard program covering the most commonly abused drugs on the marked in Norway. BZDs, representing some of the most frequently detected drugs, were found in approximately 30% (n = 1051) of the cases, represented by 14% (n = 150) female and 86% (n = 901) male drivers. In 8% of the cases, one BZD only was detected, half of these cases with one BZD could reflect therapeutic use. One or more BZDs were combined with illegal drug(s) (73%), other prescribed drugs (10%), and/or alcohol (24%). 62% of the drivers with BZD detections, had earlier been arrested for the same offence, or six cases per rearrested driver. The frequency of earlier arrests were lower for female (34%) than for male (67%) drivers. Alcohol was most frequently found for those arrested for the first time before 1992, while BZD or illegal drugs were most frequently found for those with their first arrest during 1992-1995. Our study shows that apprehended drivers using BZD are mainly represented by drug abusers due to frequent multi-drug use, blood concentrations representing doses above therapeutic levels and high rearrest rate for the same offence. A treatment program or other reactions, are thus necessary in addition to fines, prison penalty and suspension of driving licence.", 
    "43": "The lesion of the vestibular end organ evokes static and dynamic symptoms, which spontaneously regress during a complex process known as 'vestibular compensation'. Vestibular compensation is age-dependent and involves several transmitter-identified pathways in the central nervous system. In this paper we studied the time course of vestibular compensation in adult (3 months) and old (24 months) rats and correlated behavioral recovery with modifications of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA expression and benzodiazepine receptor density in different brain areas. Compensation in adult rats was complete 28 days after hemilabyrinthectomy, whereas old rats still showed significant behavioral impairment. A higher GABAergic tone was found in old rats, as indicated by higher benzodiazepine receptor density in lateral vestibular nucleus and higher mRNA level for glutamic acid decarboxylase in cerebral cortex and medial vestibular nucleus. In adult, compensated rats, benzodiazepine receptor density in the vestibular nuclei was normal 28 days after lesion, whereas GAD mRNA level was higher in anterior cingulate cortex, only. On the contrary, these parameters were still altered in anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia, vestibular nuclei and cerebellum in old rats 28 days after vestibular lesion. We also evaluated the effect of the ergoline derivative nicergoline on behavioral and neurochemical correlates of vestibular compensation in old rats. Nicergoline treatment attenuated the severity of oculomotor and postural symptoms after vestibular lesion and reversed most of these age- and lesion-induced alterations in GAD mRNA expression. Thus, lesion-related alterations of the GABAergic transmission and behavioral profile after vestibular lesion are age-dependent.",

Erythromycin cotreatment resulted in a loss of the correlation between the two clearances (r(2) = 0.39; P = 0.1). Erythromycin caused a statistically significant reduction in midazolam clearance from the original value of 3.8 to 2.5 (95% CI for the difference -2.27, -0.35) ml kg-1 min-1. Interestingly there was no significant change in the clearance of lignocaine (6.4 vs 5.8 (95% CI for the difference -2.74, -1.51) ml kg-1 min-1). Furthermore no correlation at all was observed between the MEGX-test and lignocaine or midazolam clearances.

The patients presented with a typical anticholinergic syndrome: agitation, confusion, hallucinations and combative behaviour; all of them had mydriasis, but dry mouth and tachycardia were less common.

    "53": "The role of acetylcholine (ACh) in the action of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) was studied by microdialysis, without AChesterase inhibition, to facilitate the interpretation of any observed drug effects. The atypical APDs, clozapine (2.5-20 mg/kg), olanzapine (10 mg/kg), risperidone (1 mg/kg), and ziprasidone (3 mg/kg) significantly increased ACh release in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas the typical APDs, haloperidol (0.1-1 mg/kg), S(-)-sulpiride (10-25 mg/g), and thioridazine (5-20 mg/kg) did not. None of seven APDs increased ACh release in the nucleus accumbens or striatum at the doses effective in the mPFC. Thus, atypical and typical APDs may differ in the ability to increase cortical ACh release, a possible factor contributing to cognitive improvement in schizophrenia. After perfusion with neostigmine, an AChesterase inhibitor, clozapine, but not haloperidol, increased ACh release in all three aforementioned brain regions with an enhanced effect in the mPFC, indicating the importance of studying ACh release in the absence of AChesterase inhibition. Clozapine, and perhaps other atypical APDs, alone or in combination with an AChesterase inhibitor, may improve cognition in schizophrenia, and perhaps other cognitive disorders, e.g., early Alzheimer's disease, by enhancing cortical cholinergic transmission.", 
    "54": "Acute hyperammonemia resulting from congenital urea cycle disorders, Reye syndrome or acute liver failure results in severe neuronal dysfunction, seizures and death. Increasing evidence suggests that acute hyperammonemia results in alterations of mitochondrial and cellular energy function resulting from ammonia-induced inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and by activation of the NMDA receptor. Antagonists of this receptor and NOS inhibitors prevent acute ammonia-induced seizures and mortality and prevent acute ammonia-induced changes in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and cellular energy metabolism. Acute hyperammonemia also results in decreased activities of free radical scavenging enzymes and again, free radical formation due to ammonia exposure is prevented by either NMDA receptor antagonists or NOS inhibitors. Acute hyperammonemia also results in activation of \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptors and monoamine oxidase-B, enzymes which are localized on the mitochondrial membranes of astrocytes in the CNS. Activation of these receptors results in mitochondrial swelling and in increased degradation of monoamines, respectively. Alterations of mitochondrial function could contribute to the neuronal dysfunction characteristic of acute hyperammonemic syndromes.", 
    "55": "For over 20 years, numerous investigations have focused on elucidating the function of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). This relatively small protein (18kDa) arouses great interest because of its association with numerous biological functions, including the regulation of cellular proliferation, immunomodulation, porphyrin transport and heme biosynthesis, anion transport, regulation of steroidogenesis and apoptosis. Although the receptor was first identified as a binding site for the benzodiazepine, diazepam, in peripheral organ systems, the PBR was subsequently found to be distinct from the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) in terms of its pharmacological profile, structure, subcellular localization, tissue distribution and physiological functions. The PBR is widely expressed throughout the body, with high densities found in steroid-producing tissues. In contrast, its expression in the CNS is restricted to ependymal cells and glia. The benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 and the isoquinoline carboxamide PK11195 exhibit nanomolar affinity for the PBR, and are the archtypic pharmacological tools for characterizing the receptor and its function. Primary among these functions are its regulation of steroidogenesis and apoptosis, which reflect its mitochondrial localization and involvement in oxidative processes. This review will evaluate the basic pharmacology and molecular biology of the PBR, and highlight its role in regulating mitochondrial function, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and its sensitivity to reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neurosteroid synthesis, processes relevant to the pathogenesis of a number of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "56": "Few studies have reported changes in rates of overdose after drug misuse treatment. This paper investigates changes in non-fatal overdose between treatment intake and 1 year follow-up among a sample of 753 clients recruited to the National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS). A relatively high rate of overdose (15%) was reported during the 3 months prior to treatment. Variables predictive of overdose at intake to treatment included injecting, frequency of benzodiazepine and cocaine use, quantity of alcohol consumption, and levels of anxiety. At 1 year follow-up, the rate of non-fatal overdose had fallen to 6%. Reduced rates of non-fatal overdose were found for clients treated in both residential and community treatment settings. Reductions in overdose were linked to improvements in frequency of drug use and lower rates of injecting. Clients who overdosed at follow-up showed no improvements in their substance use, except for frequency of crack cocaine use. The risk of non-fatal overdose at 1 year was associated with injecting and multiple drug use. These findings support the view that treatment an important role can play in reducing deaths among drug misusers.",

Results indicated that those less mature were more \"novelty-seeking\" and \"harm-avoidant\", while those maturer tended to be more persistent. Less mature persons answered less consistently. They agreed more with different items and their answers were more rare when compared to the general population. Heroin addicts were less sentimental and helpful and more aware of their own resources. Benzodiazepine and amphetamine addicts were more self-transcendent and self-forgetful.

    "78": "Previous studies have shown that rats withdrawn from long-term treatment with dopamine receptor blockers exhibit dopaminergic supersensitivity, which can be behaviorally evaluated by enhanced general activity observed in an open-field. Recently, it has been reported that co-treatment with the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic buspirone attenuates the development of haloperidol-induced dopaminergic supersensitivity measured by open-field behavior of rats. The aims of the present study were: 1) to determine, as previously reported for rats, if mice withdrawn from long-term neuroleptic treatment would also develop dopaminergic supersensitivity using open-field behavior as an experimental paradigm, and 2) to examine if acute buspirone administration would attenuate the expression of this behavioral dopaminergic supersensitivity. Withdrawal from long-term haloperidol treatment (2.5 mg/kg, once daily, for 20 days) induced a significant (30%) increase in ambulation frequency (i.e., number of squares crossed in 5-min observation sessions) but did not modify rearing frequency or immobility duration in 3-month-old EPM-M1 male mice observed in the open-field apparatus. Acute intraperitoneal injection of buspirone (3.0 and 10 but not 1.0 mg/kg, 12-13 animals per group) 30 min before open-field exposure abolished the increase in locomotion frequency induced by haloperidol withdrawal. These data suggest that the open-field behavior of mice can be used to detect dopaminergic supersensitivity, whose expression is abolished by acute buspirone administration.",

In this paper, three patients with difficult to treat, predominantly neuropathic pain syndromes will be described. Their pain syndromes were initially managed successfully with the addition of low dose parenteral ketamine as an analgesic adjuvant. The strategy of concurrently starting ketamine at a low dose, i.e., 40-60 mg over 24 hours, with a benzodiazepine proved effective in preventing psychotomimetic side effects. An unavoidable shortage of ketamine prompted a literature search, which suggested that the equianalgesic dose of oral ketamine could be lower than the parenteral dose. Subsequently the patients were converted to oral ketamine at doses 30 to 40% of the previous parenteral dose. Their pain syndromes remained controlled on the lower dose of oral ketamine with remarkably few side effects. The implications of this warrant further discussion and study.",

Elevating [K+] produced release of [3H]GABA over basal which was increasingly less dependent on external Ca2+ but more sensitive to the GABA transporter blocker SKF 100330 A. Accordingly, the sensitivity to clostridial toxins of the depolarization-evoked amino acid release was inversely correlated to the concentration of KCl used. However, at 50 mM K+, one-third of the stimulated release remained which was external Ca2+-independent but insensitive to SKF 100330 A. This release was prevented by BAPTA, thapsigargin or dantrolene; it also was inhibited by blocking in mitochondria the ATP production with oligomycin, the H+-dependent Ca2+ uniporter with RU 360, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with CGP 37157 or by lowering extraterminal [Na+]. In fluorescence experiments with fura-2/AM, 50 mM K+ (in Ca2+ free medium) caused elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] that was sensitive to thapsigargin or CGP 37157; these compounds produced partially additive effects. When exocytosis was monitored with the fluorescent dye acridine orange, the fluorescence elicited by 50 mM K+ was sensitive to thapsigargin or CGP 37157, which produced additive effects, and to low-Na+ media. To conclude, extracellular K+ concentrations occurring in the CNS in certain pathological conditions provoke GABA release by mechanisms different from classical exocytosis. These include carrier-mediated release and internal Ca2+-dependent exocytosis; in the latter, mitochondrial Ca2+ seems to play a primary role.", 
    "119": "Post-MI depression increases mortality, especially in the first 18 months after MI. Identifying patients at risk for post-MI depression is therefore important. In the present study we investigated possible correlates for post-MI depression on an a priori basis.", 
    "120": "Based on the literature, four clinically easily attainable variables were selected as possible correlates for post-MI depression. These were prescription of benzodiazepines during acute hospitalization, cardiac complications during acute hospitalization, history of depression, and not being able to stop smoking within six months after MI. A consecutive cohort of 173 first-MI patients was screened with the SCL-90 depression scale and DSM-III-R criteria for major depression. Of this cohort 35 depressed patients were compared with 35 non-depressed post-MI patients, matched for gender, age, and severity of MI.", 
    "121": "In univariate analyses, complications during hospitalisation (OR = 2.14; CI = 0.89-5.14), prescription of benzodiazepines (OR = 3.67; CI = 1.11-12.1), history of depression (OR = 3.0; CI = 0.87-10.4), and not being able to stop smoking (OR = 4.5; CI = 1.11-18.2) were clinical correlates for post-MI depression. Multivariate analyses showed that none of these variables were independent of the others in predicting depression.", 
    "122": "A number of easily measurable patient characteristics identify those MI-patients at risk of post-MI depression. Further investigations should focus on the predictive value of these factors in relation to post-MI depression.", 
    "123": "This study examined alcohol and licit and illicit drug use in a highly educated workforce. A comprehensive health survey of a 10% random sample of a workforce (n = 8,567) yielded a 60% response rate (n = 504) after accounting for 15 undeliverable surveys. Many respondents reported past-year use of alcohol (87%). Thirteen percent of respondents consumed three or more drinks daily; 15% were binge drinkers. Twelve percent of the workforce was assessed as having a high likelihood of lifetime alcohol dependence; 5% of respondents met criteria for current problem drinking. Overall, 42% reported using mood-altering prescription drugs (analgesics, antidepressants, sedatives, or tranquilizers). Eleven percent reported using illicit drugs (cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, or marijuana) in the past year. Significant relationships were found between gender, age, ethnicity, and occupation with some measures of alcohol consumption and use of mood-altering drugs. These results indicate prevention and early intervention programs need to address use of mood-altering substances (including alcohol) in highly educated workforces.", 
    "124": "Sevoflurane is a volatile anesthetic agent with low pungency, non-irritating odor, and low blood/gas partition coefficient that makes it an attractive alternative to halothane. However, a high incidence of emergence agitation (EA) has been reported in pediatric patients after sevoflurane anesthesia. The underlying mechanism of sevoflurane-induced EA remains unclear. Rapid recovery of consciousness (emergence) from sevoflurane anesthesia has been proposed as one possible mechanism. We, therefore, hypothesized that sedatives such as midazolam may counteract sevoflurane's rapid emergence and thus reduce the incidence and the severity of sevoflurane-induced EA.", 
    "125": "A prospective, controlled, single-blinded study was carried out in 88 ASA class I or II pediatric patients scheduled for elective outpatient surgery. Patients were assigned to receive either midazolam (oral midazolam, 0.2 mg/kg as anesthetic premedication) or saline (oral normal saline as premedication) before the conduct of anesthesia. When separation from parents was due its process was watched and evaluated. Induction of anesthesia and maintenance of anesthesia were uniform in both groups. Induction of anesthesia was made possible with 8% sevoflurane and N2O in 50% O2. Intubation was performed straight without the aid of muscle relaxant and the ventilator was set to maintain normocapnia. Anesthesia was maintained with 3% sevoflurane and N2O in 50% O2 until the surgery was over. All matters of relevant time periods were recorded (induction, surgical procedure, extubation and transportation). In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), adverse events, the incidence and the severity of EA, analgesic requirement, duration of PACU stay, and parental as well as PACU nurses' satisfaction were evaluated.", 
    "126": "A significant lower incidence and less severity of EA were noted in patients premedicated with midazolam. Less postoperaive analgesia was required in patients who had received midazolam. Although midazolam-premedicated patients remained sedated after sevoflurane anesthesia, the duration of the PACU stay was not significantly different from that of saline-treated patients. Both parents and PACU nurses were more satisfied with midazolam as premedication. No solid evidence showed that there was close correlation between the process of separation from parents and the occurrence of EA.", 
    "127": "Premedication with oral midazolam is safe, convenient and effective in decreasing the occurrence of sevoflurane-induced EA. It does not delay discharge from PACU and is suitable for outpatient surgery.", 
    "128": "In spite of the suggestion of impaired muscarinic function in adult-onset cognitive disorders, data on the expression of muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus as a function of age are inconsistent. One reason may be that the majority of investigations were unable to differentiate the five brain muscarinic receptors subtypes. In this study, using a protocol based on a combination of both kinetic and equilibrium binding approaches, we have assessed the expression and the density of M1-M5 muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus of Fisher 344 rats aged 6, 15 and 22 months. An age-related decrease of the density of M1 receptor was found in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 subfield. In this area, other subtypes of muscarinic receptors were unchanged with the exception of a loss of M2 receptor in the radial layer. In the CA3 subfield, receptor changes involved M2, M3 and M5 subtypes, whereas in the dentate gyrus, the main changes affected M1 and M2 receptors of the granular layer and M2 and M3 receptors of the molecular layer. The above findings indicate that analysis of age-related changes of different muscarinic cholinergic receptors might represent a useful contribution to identifying the basis of cholinergic neurotransmission impairment in adult-onset cognitive dysfunction.",

All patients aged up to 18 years admitted to Lund University Hospital after deliberate or probably deliberate self-poisoning from 1 January 1991 until 31 December 1995 were included. Forty-nine (58%) had used a single drug; 20 (24%) had used 3 or more drugs. Fifty-two (61%) used analgesics-paracetamol was used by 38 (45%) and propoxyphene by 17 (20%). Thirty-one (36%) had ingested psychotropics-13 used benzodiazepines, 10 antidepressants, and 8 antipsychotics. Eleven (15%) had used drugs in combination with alcohol. We conclude that it is important to follow changes in self-poisoning patterns, to monitor the effects of preventive work and discover new trends in drug use.", 
    "130": "To ascertain whether benzodiazepines (BZDs) cause behavioural side effects other than those already known or trigger latent mental illness processes, the medical records of 32 patients who had submitted claims for BZD-induced side effects to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance (SPI) claims office during 1985-92 were re-assessed by two psychiatrists on the basis of the DSM-IV system to determine whether a psychiatric syndrome existed before, during, or after the prescription of BZDs. Of the 32 case reports entered into the study, 22 concerned women; mean age at the time of SPI claim submission was 47 years, and the mean duration of BZD treatment was 11.7 years. The BZD dosages were in most cases within recommended therapeutic limits. Twenty-five claimants had also been using other psychotropic drugs. In 28 of the 32 cases a psychiatric syndrome in accordance with DSM-IV was present before the start of BZD treatment-in most cases an anxiety syndrome or anxious personality trait. In the other four cases no diagnosis could be given owing to paucity of information. In the 12 cases of claimants who fulfilled BZD dependence criteria at some point during treatment, withdrawal syndromes might have affected the clinical picture to some extent. Four claimants received additional post-BZD-treatment Axis I diagnoses, but in all four cases the new diagnoses were clearly related to the pre-existing symptom pattern. Thus, apart from the dependence on the drug there was no evidence of psychiatric morbidity caused by the BZDs. The symptoms reported by the claimants as evidence of BZD-induced psychiatric morbidity seem in most cases to have been a feature of pre-existing psychopathology which became more manifest after discontinuation of BZD treatment.",

The introduction of SSRIs has enabled a greater understanding of the role of serotonin in the etiology of panic disorder; however, the role of norepinephrine has been more challenging to ascertain. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of reboxetine, a novel selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in patients with panic disorder with and without agoraphobia.",

    "137": "Of the 82 patients enrolled in the trial, 75 were considered in the analysis (37 patients in the reboxetine group and 38 patients in the placebo group). At last assessment, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of panic attacks (range, 9.3-1.2) and phobic symptoms (range, 8.1-3.2) in the reboxetine group compared with the placebo group (ranges, 8.5-5.8 and 7.7-5.2, respectively; p < .05). Improvement in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90, and Sheehan Disability Scale scores were also greater in the reboxetine group compared with the placebo group.

Drug-release from the microspheres over a 30-day period showed a characteristic triphasic release pattern with an initial burst effect, but was linear over the same period and without a burst effect when gelatin was used as a coating agent. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the microspheres had different structures depending upon their method of preparation.",

Treatment assignment was based on purely clinical criteria, as the study did not include any experimental intervention. Patients treated with olanzapine, risperidone or haloperidol were included in the analysis.

    "144": "Radiotherapy is routinely employed in the treatment of head and neck cancers. Acute cell death, radiation-activated chemical cascades, and the induction of genes coding for protective factors like cytokines are considered to be the major processes involved in radiation damage and repair. It should be possible to follow these processes by monitoring the biochemical interactions initiated by radiation. We have carried out Raman spectroscopy studies on tissue from mice subjected to brain irradiation to identify the biochemical changes occurring in tissue and brain as a result of radiation injury. These studies show that brain irradiation produces drastic spectral changes even in tissue far removed from the irradiation site. The changes are very similar to those produced by the stress of inoculation and restraint and the administration of an anesthetic drug. While the changes produced by stress or anesthetics last for only a short time (a few hours to 1 or 2 days), radiation-induced changes persist even after 1 week. The spectral changes can be interpreted in terms of the observation of new spectra that are dominated by bands due to proteins. The results thus support the hypothesis that various protective factors are released throughout the body when the central nervous system (CNS) is exposed to radiation.",

    "147": "Somesthetic and emotional symptoms that are common in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy are usually related to hippocampo-amygdalar complex involvement. Recent stereo-electroencephalographic studies have shown a relationship between such symptoms and epileptic insular discharges. To further investigate this problem, we carried out a positron emission tomography study using fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and flumazenil (11C-FMZ) in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients. The aim of our study was to assess the existence of a cortical insular involvement in order to examine its clinical correlates and the relationship between the postoperative outcome and the insular involvement. Fluorodeoxyglucose and flumazenil-positron emission tomography studies were carried out in 18 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients. A statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) was performed to analyze the data in comparison to 18 healthy volunteers. For each set of fluorodeoxyglucose and flumazenil images a group and an individual analysis were performed. In addition, a region of interest analysis was performed to validate the results. Focusing on the metabolic abnormalities, we also investigated the role of insular cortex in the symptoms experienced by the patients and the prognostic value of insular metabolic abnormalities. Highly significant hypometabolism and BZR binding decreases were detected in the insular cortex. Results were similar using the region of interest approach. Insular involvement (mainly ipsilateral to the seizure focus) was present in 60% of the patients. Emotional symptoms correlated with hypometabolism in the anterior part of the ipsilateral insular cortex, whereas somesthetic symptoms correlated with hypometabolism in the posterior part. No relationship between postoperative outcome and ipsilateral insular hypometabolism was found. Unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with insular hypometabolism and benzodiazepine receptor loss. Our results also suggest that the anterior part of the insular cortex is involved in the emotional symptoms and the posterior insular cortex is involved in the somesthetic symptoms. Hypometabolism located in the insula did not influence postoperative outcome after anterior lobectomy.", 
    "148": "Specific biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis, namely internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, appear in the aftermath of status epilepticus (SE). This led us to hypothesize that caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is involved in DNA fragmentation and apoptotic neuronal cell death following SE. The present study aimed to determine whether SE is associated with an activation of CAD, as reflected in the degradation of the CAD inhibitor, ICAD. SE was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by kainic acid (12 mg/kg i.p.) and seizures were terminated with diazepam after 2 h. At 24, 48, or 72 h after SE termination, protein levels of CAD and ICAD were measured by Western blotting (after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) using specific antibodies. At 48 and 72 h after SE termination, ICAD protein levels significantly decreased (by more than 60%) in rhinal cortex and hippocampus as compared with those in the same tissue from animals not experiencing SE. No changes were detected in total CAD protein levels at any time point, resulting in an increase in the ratio of CAD to its inhibitor. The loss of ICAD following SE is indicative of a disinhibition of CAD, leading to DNA fragmentation. Consistent with this, we observed that the decrease in ICAD between 24 and 48 h was accompanied by a marked increase in DNA fragmentation. Our results support the proposal that CAD participates in caspase-3-mediated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the aftermath of SE.", 
    "149": "Typical and atypical antipsychotics, the mainstay of schizophrenia pharmacotherapy, have been demonstrated to affect differently neuronal gene expression in several preclinical paradigms. Here we report the differential gene expression of the glutamatergic post-synaptic density proteins Homer and PSD-95 in rat forebrain following acute haloperidol or olanzapine treatment. Moreover, considering the extensive interactions between dopaminergic and opioidergic systems we also measured striatal preproenkephalin mRNA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with haloperidol 1 mg/kg or olanzapine 0.5 mg/kg or vehicle, i.p. and sacrificed 3 h after the injection. Homer gene expression was significantly increased in caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens of rats treated with haloperidol and in the core of accumbens of rats treated with olanzapine. No changes were detected for Homer in prefrontal and parietal cortex in any of the experimental groups. PSD-95 gene expression was not modulated in our paradigm by administration of either typical or atypical antipsychotics. These results (1) suggest a differential modulation of Homer by typical and atypical antipsychotics; (2) confirm that Homer can be induced as an early gene with putative direct effect on neuronal plasticity and (3) demonstrate different response to antipsychotics by different classes of postsynaptic density proteins at glutamatergic synapses.",

Data concerning improvement of psychosis and worsening of motor function was based on Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor.", 
    "152": "Psychotic symptoms were improved in all patients. In most of them the improvement was almost total. Seven patients increased levodopa dose on OLZ, but significant worsening of motor function was reported just in one patient. None of the patients had agranulocytosis in the blood monitoring. Two patients presented weight gain. Seven patients improved their cognitive status.", 
    "153": "We conclude that OLZ at the doses studied may have efficacy for DIP which appears in PD and does not induce worsening of motor function in most of the patients.", 
    "154": "Dental care for most medically compromised patients can be accomplished if dentists understand the patients' specific medical conditions and use standard conservative behavioral or physical modifications to prevent complications from occurring. However, in patients who have certain types of neurological conditions, specifically Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, dental management typically presents a greater challenge, because, in most kinds of dementia, patients are unable to follow directions or cooperate with simple instructions such as opening their mouths or holding their heads still. This report describes a three-year retrospective chart review of patients, diagnosed with a neurologic impairment, who underwent intravenous sedation at the Department of Veterans' Affairs Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky. The goals of this review were to investigate the average doses of commonly used sedative agents, review complications as a result of the sedation, and comment on the safety of intravenous sedation as a means to treat elderly adults with a neurological disability.", 
    "155": "Orally administered Midazolam at dosages of 0.5, 0.6, and 0.75 mg/kg was used with 34 healthy, uncooperative pediatric dental patients. Effective pre-operative sedation occurred within approximately 15 minutes with a 30- to 40-minute duration of action. Blood pressure and respiration remained stable throughout. The numbers and types of procedures performed were dependent on the degree of sedation, the behavior of the patient, the experience of the operator, and the operator's ability to administer the medication. The ideal dosage appears to be 0.6 mg/kg, with an average change of 1.43 Frankel Units in behavior modification. A dosage of 0.5 mg/kg appears to yield erratic results, while a dosage of 0.75 mg/kg offers little advantage with greater potential for adverse reactions. The oral administration of Midazolam for pediatric patients with extreme behavioral problems, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, was of little advantage and may produce an idiosyncratic reaction. Midazolam's quick onset and short duration of action, coupled with its ideal properties of sedation, relaxation, and amnesia, offer a viable alternative for treating the anxious, uncooperative pediatric dental patient.", 
    "156": "Some institutionalized elderly persons need a sedative prior to a dental examination or treatment because they have a disturbance due to physical illnesses, degenerative changes in the brain, and/or psychiatric disorders, associated with advanced aging. Oral administration is one of the safest methods of delivery of a sedative drug. It is almost universally acceptable, easy to administer, costs little, has a low incidence and severity of adverse reactions, and requires no additional formal specialized training for the dentist. However, theoretical and practical knowledge of sedation is essential. This paper reviews the literature on oral sedation for the geriatric patient. Benzodiazepines are most often used for oral sedation of geriatric patients. The properties of these drugs were reviewed, and recommendations were made with respect to the drugs of choice and their dosage. Generally, fast-acting benzodiazepines of short duration, with rapid rate of elimination and no active metabolites, are recommended. The drug of choice, and the dosage, may vary according to the medical history and physical condition of the patient.", 
    "157": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate 5 mg/kg pentobarbital from saline under concurrent variable-ratio (VR) VR schedules, in which responses on the pentobarbital-biased lever were reinforced under the VR schedule with the smaller response requirements when pentobarbital was given before the session, and responses on the saline-biased key were reinforced under the VR schedule with the larger response requirements. When saline was administered before the session, the reinforcement contingencies associated with the two response keys were reversed. When responding stabilized under concurrent VR 20 VR 30, concurrent VR 10 VR 40, or concurrent VR 5 VR 50 schedules, pigeons responded almost exclusively on the key on which fewer responses were required to produce the reinforcer. When other doses of pentobarbital and other drugs were substituted for the training dose, low doses of all drugs produced responding on the saline-biased key. Higher doses of pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide produced responding only on the pentobarbital-biased key, whereas higher doses of ethanol and phencyclidine produced responding only on this key less often. d-Amphetamine produced responding primarily on the saline-biased key. When drugs generalized to pentobarbital, the shape of the generalization curve under concurrent VR VR schedules was more often graded than quantal in shape. Thus, drug discrimination can be established under concurrent VR VR schedules, but the shapes of drug-discrimination dose-response curves under concurrent VR VR schedules more closely resemble those seen under interval schedules than those seen under fixed-ratio schedules. Graded dose-response curves under concurrent VR VR schedules may relate to probability matching and difficulty in discriminating differences in reinforcement frequency.", 
    "158": "Quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) is used increasingly to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines. The present study aimed to apply the EEG method as well as more traditional approaches to an interaction study of bromazepam and fluconazole. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover study. The subjects received single oral or rectal doses of bromazepam (3 mg) after 4-day pretreatment of oral fluconazole (100 mg daily) or its placebo. Plasma bromazepam concentrations were measured before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 22, 46, and 70 hours after bromazepam administration. Pharmacodynamic effects of bromazepam were assessed using self-rated drowsiness, continuous number addition test, and EEG. Fluconazole caused no significant changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral or rectal bromazepam. Rectal administration significantly increased AUC (1.7-fold, p < 0.0001) and Cmax (1.6-fold, p < 0.0001) of bromazepam. These changes following rectal dose may be due to avoidance of degradation occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. Rectal bromazepam also increased the area under the effect curves assessed by EEG (p < 0.05) and subjective drowsiness (p < 0.05). EEG effects were closely correlated with mean plasma bromazepam concentrations (r = 0.92, p < 0.001 for placebo; r = 0.89, p < 0.0001 for fluconazole). Thus, the EEG method provided pharmacodynamic data that clearly reflected the pharmacokinetics of bromazepam.", 
    "159": "Phenibut (beta-phenyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid HCl) is a neuropsychotropic drug that was discovered and introduced into clinical practice in Russia in the 1960s. It has anxiolytic and nootropic (cognition enhancing) effects. It acts as a GABA-mimetic, primarily at GABA(B) and, to some extent, at GABA(A) receptors. It also stimulates dopamine receptors and antagonizes beta-phenethylamine (PEA), a putative endogenous anxiogenic. The psychopharmacological activity of phenibut is similar to that of baclofen, a p-Cl-derivative of phenibut. This article reviews the structure-activity relationship of phenibut and its derivatives. Emphasis is placed on the importance of the position of the phenyl ring, the role of the carboxyl group, and the activity of optical isomers. Comparison of phenibut with piracetam and diazepam reveals similarities and differences in their pharmacological and clinical effects. Phenibut is widely used in Russia to relieve tension, anxiety, and fear, to improve sleep in psychosomatic or neurotic patients; as well as a pre- or post-operative medication. It is also used in the therapy of disorders characterized by asthenia and depression, as well as in post-traumatic stress, stuttering and vestibular disorders.", 
    "160": "The objective of this study was to determine the concentration-electroencephalogram (EEG) relationships for midazolam, a full-agonist benzodiazepine ligand, on multiple occasions in individual rats, and to examine the effect of chronic midazolam exposure on that relationship. Rats were chronically instrumented with venous and arterial cannulas, and cortical EEG electrodes. The rats received either: 7 days of midazolam 10 mg kg(-1) intravenously once a day (midazolam group); or midazolam on days 1 and 7 and vehicle on days 2-6 (vehicle group). Concentration-effect relationships were determined on days 1, 4 and 7 from multiple blood and EEG samples before and after the administration of the midazolam dose. The concentration-EEG effect relationships were consistent with a sigmoidal Emax (maximal effect) model. No differences in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters were found between day 1 and day 7 in either group. However, in the midazolam group, both the fraction unbound of midazolam in serum and the EC50 (concentration at half-maximal effect) for free midazolam increased from days 1-7 by 35 +/- 3% and 54 +/- 25%, respectively (means +/- s.d., P< 0.05). This may be related to decreased serum albumin levels in the midazolam group (-19+5%, P < 0.05) which, in turn, could be explained by the sedation associated with daily midazolam treatment. We concluded that concentration-EEG effect relationships can be studied on multiple occasions in individual animals, reducing animal use and variability. A modest degree of tolerance to midazolam was found with this paradigm, the effect only being evident after correction for the fraction unbound of midazolam.",

Melatonin doses ranged from 0.5 mg to 6 mg; most took a single dose 30-120 min before bedtime. In 3 studies a slow release form was used. Sleep quality was objectively measured by wrist actigraphy (n = 4) and polysomnography (n = 2), and additionally subjective sleep quality was assessed (n = 2). Sleep latency decreased significantly in 4 studies. In 3 studies other measures of sleep quality (sleep efficiency, total sleep time and wake time during sleep) improved.

    "168": "Of 444 patients admitted, 147 (33%) used at least one benzodiazepine which was in 75% of the cases, short-elimination half-life BZD used as hypnotic. Of 105 (23.6%) patients using BZD at admission, 23 (5.2%) stopped BZD during hospital stay or when leaving hospital. The in-hospital prevalence of BZD use was 30% (133 patients). In 28 (6.3%) patients without BZD at baseline, BZD was introduced during the hospital stay then stopped at discharge in 18 (4%) patients. The prevalence of BZD use at discharge was 23.9% (106 patients). In multivariate analyses, BZD use was significantly associated with number of drugs taken during hospitalization (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03-1.24), and current neuropsychiatric diseases (OR: 2.12; 95% CI: 0.86-5.23), but not with gender, age or length of stay.", 
    "169": "Prevalence of BZD use appeared to be fairly high among hospitalized patients. There were very few new BZD users during hospital stay, most of whom were stopped at discharge. Most treatments were started before hospital, and continued during and after hospital stay without clear reevaluation.",

Dopamine blocking agents such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, may induce akathisia. Particular care must be taken to distinguish akathisia from psychotic agitation and restless legs. The prevalence of akathisia in patients using classical antipsychotics is 20-30% and for users of clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (atypical antipsychotics) it is lower. Risk factors are a high dosage of antipsychotics, akathisia in a previous treatment, and diabetes mellitus. The treatment of akathisia starts, if possible, with the antipsychotic being withdrawn or the dose administered being lowered. Another treatment possibility is switching to clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine, or adding a beta-blocking agent, an anticholinergic or mianserin.",

Abnormally high levels of orotic acid were found in serum and urine, confirming the diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Although computed tomography findings are non-specific, young patients with unexplained hyperammonemic states of somnolence reversed by flumazenil should be screened for this X-linked recessive metabolic disorder.", 
    "173": "We have previously reported sub optimal use of hypnotics in geriatric institutions. In the present study we examined the intervention by a pharmacist on the prescribing and administration of hypnotics in nursing homes. Thus a follow up study was performed in 5 nursing homes included in the previous study.", 
    "174": "In the period between the two surveys the pharmacist provided drug information on the rational use of hypnotics, both written and verbal, to the staff of the institutions. Data on the administration of hypnotics was obtained from the Cardex system in the institutions. Data were compared to a control group in other nursing homes, where no intervention was carried out.", 
    "175": "Although the population was older in 2000 than in 1995, the proportion of patients using hypnotics (24%) was similar. Use of benzodiazepines was reduced from 81% to 40%, use of long acting benzodiazepines was reduced from 62% to 22%, and use of short-acting hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem) increased from 9% to 53%. Furthermore, hypnotics administered before 9 p.m. were reduced from 40% to 14%, and the time of administration showed less variation than before. In the control population we also observed the use of short acting hypnotics in favour of benzodiazepines, similar to the results in the 5 institutions. However, in this population a significantly higher proportion of patients used hypnotics, used more than 1 hypnotic and the hypnotics were administered earlier in the evening.",

    "177": "Mitochondria sequester N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced Ca(2+) loads and regulate the shape of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses in neurons. When isolated mitochondria are exposed to high [Ca(2+)](,) Ca(2+) enters the matrix via the uniporter and returns to the cytosol by Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. Released Ca(2+) may re-enter the mitochondrion recycling across the inner membrane dissipating respiratory energy. Ca(2+) recycling, the continuous uptake and release of Ca(2+) by mitochondria, has not been described in intact neurons. Here we used single-cell microfluorimetry to measure [Ca(2+)](i) and mitochondrially targeted aequorin to measure matrix Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](mt)) to determine whether Ca(2+) recycles across the mitochondrial inner membrane in intact neurons following treatment with NMDA. We used ruthenium red and CGP 37157 to block uptake via the uniporter and release via Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, respectively. As predicted by the Ca(2+) recycling hypothesis, blocking the uniporter immediately following challenge with 200 microM NMDA produced a rapid and transient increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) without a corresponding increase in matrix Ca(2+). Blocking mitochondrial Ca(2+) release produced the opposite effect, depressing cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and prolonging the time for matrix Ca(2+) levels to recover. The Ca(2+) recycling hypothesis uniquely predicts these reciprocal changes in the Ca(2+) levels between the two compartments. Ca(2+) recycling was not detected following treatment with 20 microM NMDA. Thus Ca(2+) recycling across the inner membrane was more pronounced following treatment with a high relative to a low concentration of NMDA, consistent with a role in Ca(2+)-dependent neurotoxicity.", 
    "178": "Psychotropic medications are an important treatment approach to mental health disorders; such disorders are common in the elderly population. Elderly patients are more likely to experience adverse effects from these agents than their younger counterparts due to age-related changes in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters. Because of these factors, inappropriate use of psychotropic medications in elderly patients has become a focus of concern. In general an agent is considered inappropriate if the risk associated with its use exceeds its benefit. Implicit and explicit criteria for inappropriate use of medications in the elderly have been created and include psychotropic agents. These criteria vary in their make-up but the explicit criteria tend to agree that amitriptyline, doxepin, and benzodiazepines that have long half-lives are not appropriate. Although explicit inappropriate medication criteria have been in existence since 1991, elderly patients continue to receive inappropriate psychotropic medications. A wide array of factors may be responsible for this practice. Provider-related causes include deficits in knowledge, confusion due to the lack of a consensus on the inappropriate psychotropic criteria, difficulties in addressing an inappropriate medication started by a previous provider, multiple prescribers and pharmacies involved in the care of a patient, negative perceptions regarding aging, and cost issues. Patients may contribute to the problem by demanding an inappropriate medication. Finally, the healthcare setting may inadvertently contribute to inappropriate prescribing by such policies as restrictive formularies or lack of reimbursement for pharmacists' clinical services. Successful approaches to optimising prescribing have been either educational or administrative. Educational approaches (e.g. one-on-one sessions, academic detailing) seek to influence decision making, while administrative approaches attempt to enforce policies to curtail the undesired practice. The US Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, which improved psychotropic medication use in long-term care, is an excellent example of administrative intervention. More research specifically focused on the causes of inappropriate psychotropic medication use and methods to avoid this practice is needed before targeted recommendations can be made.", 
    "179": "Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine anti-anxiety agent that acts at the limbic, thalamic, and hypothalamic level of the CNS and has anxioytic. sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties. A retrospective study was conducted of 415 alprazolam ingestions in dogs reported to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center between January 1998 and August 2000: 238 suspected alprazolam toxicoses in dogs were evaluated. Clinical signs were ataxia/disorientation, depression, hyperactivity, vomiting, weakness, tremors, vocalization, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypothermia, diarrhea, and increased salivation that developed within 10-30 min post-ingestion. Treatment included standard decontamination procedures, such as emesis and activated charcoal: the specific benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, may be used for severe CNS depression.", 
    "180": "Four sesquiterpenes, beta-selinene, isocurcumenol, nootkatone and aristolone and one triterpene, oleanolic acid were isolated from the ethylacetate fraction of the rhizomes of Cyperus rotundus and tested for their ability to modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A))-benzodiazepine receptor function by radioligand binding assays using rat cerebrocortical membranes. Among these compounds, only isocurcumenol, one of the newly identified constituents of this plant, was found to inhibit [3H]Ro15-1788 binding and enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the presence of GABA. These results suggest that isocurcumenol may serve as a benzodiazepine receptor agonist and allosterically modulate GABAergic neurotransmission via enhancement of endogenous receptor ligand binding.", 
    "181": "The methanolic extract of Clerodendrum phlomidis Linn. (MECP) leaves was evaluated for its psychopharmacological activities in several experimental models using Swiss albino mice and Wistar albino rats. The MECP was found to cause significant reduction in spontaneous activity, and decreases in exploratory behavioral profiles by the Y-maze and head dip test. It also showed reduction in muscle relaxant activity by rotarod, 30 degrees inclined screen and traction tests, as well as significantly potentiated the phenobarbitone sodium-induced sleeping time in the doses examined (200, 400 and 600 mg/kg body wt.). All the results were compared with respective controls for the evaluation of significance.", 
    "182": "Converging evidence indicates that, in controlled drug trials, individuals receiving novel antipsychotic medications have fewer adverse effects than those receiving conventional antipsychotic medications. This in turn may lead to greater patient treatment satisfaction. This study examines patient satisfaction and burden of adverse effects in a county-wide epidemiologic study of first admission psychotic persons with psychosis who were receiving novel antipsychotic drugs (n = 42). Comparisons were made within this group, and between 25 of these persons and 25 others with the same diagnosis and sex, from the same epidemiologic study, who were receiving a comparable regimen of conventional antipsychotic drugs. Patients receiving novel antipsychotics were significantly more satisfied and were significantly less burdened by adverse effects than those receiving conventional antipsychotics. Among the group receiving novel antipsychotics, dosage was not related to satisfaction or burden of adverse effects. For those treated with risperidone (n = 27), there was a difference, approaching statistical significance, for greater satisfaction and less adverse effect burden among those persons with dosages less than 5 mg daily as compared to higher dosages.",

    "184": "(1) Generalised anxiety disorder is defined as excessive anxiety for at least 6 months. (2) Management is based primarily on psychological measures, with the aim of limiting recourse to drugs. The reference drugs are benzodiazepines. The treatment period should be as short as possible, to avoid adverse effects such as sedation and dependence. (3) Venlafaxine is a non tricyclic, non MAOI antidepressant. A sustained-release formulation has just been granted marketing authorisation in France for generalised anxiety disorder. (4) The clinical assessment file on venlafaxine in this indication includes results from two 8-week trials and a placebo-controlled trial with 6 months follow-up. The trials showed a significant improvement with venlafaxine on standard anxiety scales, but the clinical impact (at best moderate) has been poorly assessed. We found no comparison between venlafaxine and benzodiazepines. (5) In one trial venlafaxine was no more effective than buspirone. (6) The most frequent adverse effects of venlafaxine are gastrointestinal disorders, insomnia and dizziness. Venlafaxine carries a risk of drug interactions and withdrawal symptoms. (7) In practice, venlafaxine provides nothing new in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. The reference drug treatment remains a benzodiazepine.", 
    "185": "Solid-phase extraction-pipette tips (SPE-PTs) were used for micro solid-phase extraction of lidocaine and diazepam from plasma. Off-line extraction was followed by on-line desorption. On-line desorption was carried out by direct coupling of the SPE-PTs with the liner of the programmed-temperature vaporiser. This coupling only required shortening of the liner by maximally 16 mm, cutting the SPE-PT, and equipping the remaining part with two O-rings. Due to the heating of the injector the SPE-PTs were heated as well, which resulted in a significant amount of impurities. Pre-heating and pre-washing was performed prior to the extraction to reduce the impurity level. The internal coupling device was applied successfully for the analysis of plasma samples with gas chromatography (GC) and mass-selective detection. Detection limits of 0.75 ng/ml and 2.5 ng/ml were obtained for lidocaine and diazepam, respectively, using 200 microl plasma. Recoveries for both compounds were about 80%. Although it is possible, the internal coupling device was not developed to be used as such. The main goal of this coupling was to show the feasibility of the integration of SPE-PTs with GC and to realize an important step to new automated SPE-GC systems.",

    "187": "The present study used a repeated-acquisition technique and dose-effect determinations before, during and after neurotoxic MDMA exposure to characterize the effects of serotonergic drugs on learning, and to determine if MDMA-induced serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxicity is associated with learning deficits as measured by changes in response rate or the percentage of errors.", 
    "188": "The effects of various serotonergic drugs were characterized in six squirrel monkeys responding under a repeated-acquisition procedure before and after neurotoxic dose regimens of MDMA. Specifically, cumulative dose-effect curves for m-CPP (0.032-1 mg/kg), fenfluramine (0.1-3.2 mg/kg) and triazolam (0.0032-0.1 mg/kg) were obtained prior to MDMA administration, with the latter drug serving as a non-5-HT control.", 
    "189": "In general, all of the drugs tested decreased overall response rate as the cumulative dose increased, whereas only triazolam markedly increased the percentage of errors. MDMA treatment produced significant (80-99%) decreases in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA axonal markers, but did not lead to changes in either dependent measure of responding or shifts in the dose-effect curves obtained during pharmacological challenges with m-CPP, fenfluramine or triazolam.", 
    "190": "Taken together, these results demonstrate that serotonergic drugs can disrupt learning in monkeys, but indicate that MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity does not lead to disruptions in this particular type of serial learning task.",

    "192": "Our objective was to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of steady-state ethinyl estradiol (INN, ethinylestradiol) and single-dose triazolam were altered after 4 weeks of modafinil treatment in volunteers.", 
    "193": "This was a placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-period study in 41 female subjects who were receiving long-term treatment with an oral contraceptive that contained ethinyl estradiol (0.035 mg) and norgestimate (0.180-0.250 mg). Pharmacokinetic profiles for ethinyl estradiol and for a single oral dose of triazolam (0.125 mg) were obtained the day before initiation of treatment with modafinil (200 mg for 7 days, followed by 400 mg for 21 days) or placebo (28 days). A second dose of triazolam was administered with the final dose of modafinil, and pharmacokinetic profiling was repeated.", 
    "194": "The modafinil treatment group had a marked decrease in maximum observed plasma concentrations and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve for triazolam relative to placebo, with a much smaller decrease in these parameters for ethinyl estradiol. The half-life of triazolam was also decreased, but the half-life of ethinyl estradiol did not appear to be affected by treatment with modafinil.", 
    "195": "Modafinil induced CYP3A4/5 activity in humans in vivo, suggesting that there is potential for metabolic drug-drug interactions between modafinil and substrates of CYP3A4/5. However, the induction appeared to be more gastrointestinal than hepatic in nature. Therefore significant metabolic drug-drug interactions are most likely to occur with compounds (such as triazolam) that undergo significant gastrointestinal CYP3A4/5-mediated first-pass metabolism.", 
    "196": "The metabolic pathways of most xenobiotics and endogenous compounds can be divided into phase 1 (oxidative, reductive, and hydrolytic) and phase 2 (glucuronidation, sulfate conjugation, glycine and glutathione conjugation, and acetylation and methylation) processes. Oxidative metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system has been intensively investigated compared with glucuronidation and other conjugation pathways. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the disposition of olanzapine or risperidone in healthy volunteers with and without coadministration of the uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor probenecid. We hypothesized that olanzapine disposition would be altered as a result of decreased glucuronidation, whereas risperidone disposition would be relatively unaffected.", 
    "197": "Our objective was to investigate whether this interaction would occur in 12 healthy volunteers, aged 22 to 42 years, who participated in a single-dose, randomized, 4-period, double-blind, crossover study receiving a single dose of either 5 mg olanzapine or 1 mg risperidone with and without 500 mg probenecid (8 doses over 4 days). Multiple blood samples were analyzed by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or HPLC to assess the 48-hour time course of risperidone and olanzapine. Urine was assayed for free and glucuronidated drugs.", 
    "198": "When olanzapine was administered with probenecid, statistically significant differences were observed between plasma pharmacokinetic parameters compared with olanzapine administered alone (maximum concentration, P <.05; area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours, P <.01). Clearance was not significantly different between the treatment phases. Risperidone pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different (all parameters, P >.05).", 
    "199": "Inhibition of uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase appeared to influence the disposition of olanzapine but not risperidone. Phase 2 metabolism may significantly influence the disposition of antipsychotic drugs and may be an important aspect of the variability in metabolism, participation in drug-drug interactions, and clinical response to some antipsychotic agents.", 
    "200": "The authors compared the efficacy and safety of three atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) with one another and with haloperidol in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.", 
    "201": "In a double-blind trial, 157 inpatients with a history of suboptimal treatment response were randomly assigned to treatment with clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol for 14 weeks (an 8-week escalation and fixed-dose period followed by a 6-week variable-dose period).", 
    "202": "Clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine (but not haloperidol) resulted in statistically significant improvements in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Improvements seen in total and negative symptom scores with clozapine and olanzapine were superior to haloperidol. The atypical drugs, particularly olanzapine and clozapine, were associated with weight gain.", 
    "203": "The effects of atypical antipsychotics in this population were statistically significant but clinically modest. The overall pattern of results suggests that clozapine and olanzapine have similar general antipsychotic efficacy and that risperidone may be somewhat less effective. Clozapine was the most effective treatment for negative symptoms. However, the differences among treatments were small."
