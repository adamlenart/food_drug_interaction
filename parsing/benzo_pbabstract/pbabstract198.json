The aim of the present study was to gain more insight into the pattern of the generalized auditory startle reflex (ASR). Reflex EMG responses to auditory startling stimuli in seven muscles rather than the EMG response of the OO alone as well as the psychogalvanic reflex (PGR) were studied in PTSD patients and healthy controls. Ten subjects with chronic PTSD (>3 months) and a history of excessive startling and 11 healthy controls were included. Latency, amplitude and duration of the EMG responses and the amplitude of the PGR to 10 auditory stimuli of 110 dB SPL were investigated in seven left-sided muscles. The size of the startle reflex, defined by the number of muscles activated by the acoustic stimulus and by the amplitude of the EMG response of the OO muscle as well, did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Median latencies of activity in the sternocleidomastoid (SC) (patients 80 ms; controls 54 ms) and the deltoid (DE) muscles (patients 113 ms; controls 69 ms) were prolonged significantly in PTSD compared to controls (P < 0.05). In the OO muscle, a late response (median latency in patients 308 ms; in controls 522 ms), probably the orienting reflex, was more frequently present in patients (56%) than in controls (12%). In patients, the mean PGR was enlarged compared to controls (P < 0.05). The size of the ASR response is not enlarged in PTSD patients. EMG latencies in the PTSD patients are prolonged in SC and DE muscles. The presence of a late response in the OO muscle discriminates between groups of PTSD patients with a history of startling and healthy controls. In addition, the autonomic response, i.e. the enlarged amplitude of the PGR can discriminate between these groups.",

In this analysis we have included schizophrenia, affective disorders/bipolar, organic psychoses, and senile psychoses, with undefined psychosis and chronic brain syndrome grouped as 'other'. This synopsis provides a backdrop against which the theme articles in this issue of Australian Family Physician can be further considered.", 
    "2": "The authors examined cognitive changes associated with treatment with ziprasidone and olanzapine over a 6-month double-blind clinical trial, using normative standards for the cognitive measures. Sixty-two schizophrenia patients entered the study on ziprasidone treatment (39 completers), and 71 patients entered while receiving treatment with olanzapine (33 completers). From a larger set of cognitive domains assessed in the acute treatment study, we selected verbal learning, executive functioning, and verbal fluency for further analysis due to their functional relevance and extensive normative data. Standard scores were developed based on previously published age- and education-corrected norms. Baseline performance was impaired across all tests on average. The proportion of patients impaired on each of the tests at baseline ranged from 36% (letter fluency) to 89%. Performance was significantly improved by ziprasidone and olanzapine treatment for all cognitive variables and for the composite measure. A number of subjects met the a priori criteria for normalization in performance, ranging from 10% for Trail Making Test Part B to 37% for Word List Total Learning. There were no significant differences across medications in extent of change or likelihood of inducing normalization. Statistically significant improvements in cognitive performance over 6 months of treatment with atypical antipsychotic medications are associated with performance increasing into the normal range of cognitive functioning in a proportion of previously impaired patients.", 
    "3": "The use of antiepileptic drugs (AED), their primary indication, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications were collected from 565 nursing homes (NH) residents of six NH located around the city of Mainz, Germany representing 5.05% of all NH residents in the area. Data were collected from the electronic pharmacy files and by reviewing all available medical records. Average age was 82.2 +/- 2.4 years, 85.5% were women. Of 565 NH residents 28 (4.96%) received AED therapy, of which in 17 (63%) AED were prescribed for a seizure-related diagnosis. In 76.5% seizure types were unspecified and a distinction in focal and generalized epilepsy was made in only 23.5% of patients. Three patients never had epileptic seizures and in four residents the reason for AED use was unclear. AEDs most frequently prescribed were carbamazepine (37.1%), valproic acid (25.9%), and phenytoin (14.8%). Five patients received benzodiazepines (18.5%), newer generation AED were used in only four (14.8%) cases. Residents on average took n = 5.6 +/- 3.3 other drugs. Opportunities exist for health care professionals to improve the medical management of nursing facility residents receiving AEDs.", 
    "4": "Palmar, plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis, though benign, may be burdensome and occupationally restrictive, even hazardous. Treatment modalities range from topical antiperspirants, iontophoresis, systemic medications such as anticholinergics and benzodiazepines and injections of botulinum toxin, to thoracic sympathectomy. Intradermal injections of botulinum toxin (BTX), though effective, are painful especially when multiple injections are required. Iontophoretic administration of BTX has been described, the BTX entering the eccrine sweat glands via the sweat pores and through the sweat ducts. We postulate that BTX can be administered topically, either unassisted or assisted by application of an electrical gradient, low-frequency ultrasound or excipients such as dimethylsulfoxide. We examine the rationale and feasibility for such a treatment modality and route of administration.", 
    "5": "Recent clinical studies have suggested that treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as olanzapine, may slow progressive changes in brain structure in patients with schizophrenia. To investigate the possible neural basis of this effect, we sought to determine whether treatment with olanzapine would inhibit the loss of hippocampal neurons associated with the administration of the excitotoxin, kainic acid, in neonatal rats. At post-natal day 7 (P7), rats were exposed to kainic acid via intracerebroventricular administration. Neuronal loss within the CA2 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus and neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were then assessed at P14 by Fluoro-Jade B and BrdU labeling, respectively. Daily doses of olanzapine (2, 6, or 12 mg/day), haloperidol (1.2 mg/kg), melatonin (10 mg/kg), or saline were administered between P7 and P14. Melatonin is an anti-oxidant drug and was included in this study as a positive control, since it has been observed to have neuroprotective effects in a variety of animal models. The highest dose of olanzapine and melatonin, but not haloperidol, ameliorated the hippocampal neuronal loss triggered by kainic acid administration. However, drug administration did not have a significant effect on the rate of neurogenesis. These results suggest that olanzapine has neuroprotective effects in a rat model of neurodevelopmental insult, and may be relevant to the observed effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs on brain structure in patients with schizophrenia.",

The search terms were essential tremor and tardive dyskinesia. Reference lists from articles were also consulted.", 
    "12": "Essential tremor is most commonly manifested as a postural or action tremor of the upper extremities. Midline regions such as the head and voice are also commonly affected. Based on review of the literature, propranolol and primidone are the current pharmacologic mainstays for treating essential tremor of the upper extremities. The choice of agent depends on patient-specific factors such as underlying medical conditions. Other agents with demonstrated efficacy include gabapentin and topiramate. Benzodiazepines are effective adjunctive agents, but should be utilized judiciously in the elderly. Botulinum toxin is effective for essential tremor of the voice and head. Surgery is very effective, but may not be appropriate in the frail elderly and should be avoided in the presence of cognitive impairment. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary choreoathetoid movements of the orofacial region. For the management of tardive dyskinesia, emphasis is placed on primary prevention and early recognition of signs and symptoms. In some cases, discontinuation of the offending agent can result in reversal of symptoms. If a conventional neuroleptic is the causative agent, switching to an atypical antipsychotic may be helpful. Overall, few treatments have proven to be consistently useful. Other agents that may be helpful include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, amantadine, baclofen, benzodiazepines, branched chain amino acids, gabapentin, levetiracetam, pyridoxine, verapamil, and vitamin E.",

First, enantioselectivity and electrospray sensitivity of six chiral polymeric surfactants for all three chiral compounds are compared. Second, using poly(sodium N-undecenoyl-L-leucinate) as pseudostationary phase, the organic modifiers (methanol (MeOH), isopropanol, and ACN) are added into the running buffer to further improve chiral resolution (RS). Next, a CMEKC-ESI-MS method for the simultaneous enantioseparation of two benzodiazepines is further developed by using a dipeptide polymeric surfactant, poly(sodium N-undecenoxy carbonyl-L,L-leucyl-valinate) (poly-L,L-SUCLV). The CMEKC conditions including nebulizer pressure, capillary length, ammonium acetate concentration, pH, poly-L,L-SUCLV concentration, and capillary temperature were optimized to achieve maximum chiral RS and highest sensitivity of MS detection. The spray chamber parameters (drying gas temperature and drying gas flow rate) as well as sheath liquid conditions (MeOH content, pH, flow rate, and ionic strength) were found to significantly influence MS S/N of both (+/-)-OXA and (+/-)-LOR. Finally, a comparative study between simultaneous UV and MS detection showed high plate numbers, better chiral RS, and enhanced detectability with CMEKC-MS. However, speed of analysis was faster using CMEKC-UV.",

    "16": "The present study examined the effects of restraint stress on PFC function in both male rats and cycling female rats in either the proestrus (high estrogen) or estrus (low estrogen) phase of the estrus cycle. Animals were restrained for 60 or 120 minutes and then tested on spatial delayed alternation, a PFC-mediated task. Performance after stress was compared to performance on a different day under no-stress conditions, and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).",

This effect has been previously observed after administration of a pharmacological stressor (the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG7142), and results from both studies may be relevant to the increased prevalence of stress-related disorders, such as major depressive disorder, in cycling women. Overall, the results show that restraint stress has important effects on the cognitive functions of the PFC, and that hormonal influences in the PFC are an important area for future research.",

Midazolam is the drug which is particularly willingly used in neonatal intensive care units. Although commonly accepted as a safe drug, midazolam produced adverse effects which could make early as well late treatment outcome worse. In this paper the results of pharmacokinetics studies and studies concerning the adverse effects of midazolam among low birth weight newborn are collected and the current opinion of experts dedicates regarding analgetic and sedative procedures in neonatal period are presented. On the basis of the results of the previous studies, it seems reasonable to be more critical of our sedation approach with midazolam and pay more attention to appropriate administration of midazolam in neonatal period.",

    "31": "The history of experimental studies on myopia is presented. Anatomical and biochemical changes taking place in the eyeball during experimental induction of myopia are described. Additionally, the following substances inhibiting the progress of experimental myopia are discussed: atropine, oxyphenonium, pirenzepine, chlorpyrifos, apomorphine, reserpine, 6-hydroxy dopamine, dextromethorphan, MK-801, APV, bicuculline, SR95531, CACA, TPMPA, dextrorphanol, levorphanol, D- and L-naloxane, L-NAME, formoguanamine, beta-xyloside, central and peripheral antagonists of VIP, and basic fibroblast growth factor. As the pathogenesis of experimental myopia is similar to progressive myopia, the above-mentioned substances can be treated as potential remedies inhibiting the process of myopia in man. Since 1991, apomorphine and pirenzepine continue to stir hope among researchers because it has been shown that apomorphine in the form of subconjunctival or intravitreal injections or topical preparation inhibits the progression of experimental myopia in primates and chickens. Apart from that it has been observed that pirenzepine administered subconjunctivally or intravitreally inhibits the progression of myopia in tree shrews and chickens. These observations led Siatkowski et al. and Tan et al. to undertake clinical studies in humans. Administration for one year of 2% pirenzepine ophthalmic gel in children resulted in reduction of myopia by 44-51 % as compared with a control group. This result of Siatkowski et al. and Tan et al. represents a breakthrough in the treatment of myopia and clearly indicates that we will be able in the near future to slow down or even block the progression of this refractive anomaly.",

Sleep efficacy endpoints from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult populations and key review articles published between 1975 and 2004 were included in this review. As only one randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluated trazodone use in primary insomnia, the trazodone search was expanded to include all clinical trials that evaluated trazodone use in insomnia. Relevant texts and other articles that evaluated side effect profiles of these agents were also included, one of which was published in January of 2005. In all publications, impact of treatment on sleep maintenance parameters (wake time after sleep onset, number of awakenings) and measures of next-day functioning were evaluated, in addition to sleep onset parameters (sleep latency, time to sleep onset/induction) and sleep duration data (total sleep time).",

The extraction procedure was performed with automatic solid phase extraction, and the compounds were separated with a Sunfire column using a gradient mode. Deuterated analogues for all of the analytes of interest were used for quantitation. Limits of detection (LOD) were established between 0.5 and 1 ng/ml. Linearity was obtained over a range of 2-2,000 ng/ml with an average correlation coefficient (R(2)) of >0.99. Intra- and inter-batch coefficients of variation and relative mean errors were less than 10% for all analytes and concentrations. The recoveries were higher than 50.0% in all cases.

The NPY mRNA expression levels and patterns were examined after the last drug administration at both time points enabling the measurement of immediate effect at 2h and the effects after 48 h of drug administration. It was found that all these drugs had an immediate effect on NPY mRNA expression, while virtually all these changes normalized 48 h after the drug treatments. A similarity in altered NPY mRNA expression patterns was seen between the olanzapine and clozapine groups; however, haloperidol was very different. Olanzapine and clozapine administration decreased NPY mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens, striatum and anterior cingulate cortex (from -60% to -77%, p<0.05). Haloperidol decreased NPY mRNA expression in the amygdala and hippocampus (-69%, -64%, p<0.05). In the lateral septal nucleus, NPY mRNA levels significantly decreased in the olanzapine group (-66%, p<0.05), a trend toward a decrease was observed in the clozapine group, and no change was found in the haloperidol treated group. These results suggest that the different effects of atypical and typical antipsychotics on NPY systems may reflect the neural chemical mechanisms responsible for the differences between these drugs in their effects in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The immediate decrease of NPY mRNA levels suggests an immediate reduction of NPY biosynthesis in response to these drugs.", 
    "46": "Koso-san (Xiang-Su-San in Chinese), a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine, is used clinically in East Asia for the treatment of depression-like symptoms associated with the initial stage of the common cold, allergic urticaria due to food ingestion, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia, and autonomic imbalance. However, the antidepressant-like activity of Koso-san has never been evaluated scientifically. In this study, ddY mice subjected to a combination of forced swimming and chronic mild stresses were termed depression-like model mice. The degree of the depression-like state was measured by the animal's duration of immobility using the forced swimming test (FST). Oral administration of Koso-san (1.0 g/kg/body wt./day, 9 days) significantly shortened the duration of immobility of the depression-like model mice in the FST; however, locomotor activity was not affected. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. Levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and proopiomelanocortin mRNA expression in the pituitary were significantly increased, and glucocorticoid receptor protein expression in the hypothalamus paraventricular nucleus was downregulated in the depression-like model mice. However, Koso-san ameliorated these alterations to the normal conditions. The results of this study suggest that Koso-san shows the antidepressant-like effect through suppressing the hyperactivity of the HPA axis in depression-like model mice.",

We also demonstrated the in vivo 5-HT2A receptor occupancy of olanzapine using positron emission tomography. An open-label prospective 6-week study design with 14 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study were enrolled from the general community of the St. Louis metropolitan area. All patients met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder without psychosis, had a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) score >18 and were between the ages of 18 and 65. The primary measure of efficacy was the change in HAMD 17 total score from baseline to endpoint. The data were collected between 1998 and 2004. There was a significant reduction in the HAMD17 scores from baseline to endpoint. Half the patients (n=6) showed > or =50% reduction in their HAMD17 scores. This study points to the potential of olanzapine as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of major depressive disorder without psychosis.",

Effects of acute and extended exposure to grapefruit juice (trials 2 and 3) were similar, and produced augmentation in benzodiazepine agonist effects measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and electroencephalographic beta amplitude. Kinetic and dynamic effects reverted to baseline (trial 1) values at 3 days after grapefruit juice discontinuation (trial 4). Ritonavir caused a more than 20-fold increase in the triazolam area under the plasma concentration curve during trial 2 (553 +/- 422 ng/mL.h) and trial 3 (287 +/- 299 ng/mL.h) compared to the trial 1 control (13.3 +/- 16.3 ng/mL.h) (P < .05 for both comparisons); Digit Symbol Substitution Test and electroencephalographic pharmacodynamics increased in parallel. During trial 4, triazolam kinetics reverted close to trial 1 values, with no evidence of induction. Triazolam kinetics were not altered by water cotreatment.",

Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition prolongs survival and cannabinoids ameliorate progression of clinical disease in animal models of ALS and MS respectively, but the mechanism is uncertain. Therefore, three key molecules known to be expressed in activated microglial cells/macrophages, COX-2, CB2 and P2X7, which plays a role in inflammatory cascades, were studied in MS and ALS post-mortem human spinal cord.",

In addition, autoradiography for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites was performed on some spinal cord sections using [3H] (R)-PK11195, a marker of activated microglial cells/macrophages.

Inflammatory cell marker CD68-immunoreactivity, [3H] (R)-PK11195 autoradiography, and double-staining against ferritin confirmed increased production of COX-2 by activated microglial cells/macrophages. An expected 70-kDa band was seen by Western blotting which was significantly increased in MS spinal cord. There was good correlation between the COX-2 immunostaining and optical density of the COX-2 70-kDa band in the MS group (r = 0.89, P = 0.0011, n = 10). MS and ALS specimens also had significantly greater density of P2X7 and CB2-immunoreactive microglial cells/macrophages in affected regions.",

Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is closely associated with personality traits for anxiety tolerance, and that it holds promise as a biological marker of stressful conditions. We have performed association analyses using the polymorphism to determine the PBR in PD. We screened the subjects for sequence variations within the 5' region, the coding region (exons 2-4), and the 3' noncoding region. One novel missense variant in exon 4, derived from the nucleotide transition in codon 162 (CGT --> CAT:485G > A) resulting in an arginine-to-histidine (Arg --> His) change, was detected in these subjects. The 485G > polymorphism of the PBR gene was analyzed in 91 PD patients and 178 controls. The genotypic and allelic analyses of the 485G > A revealed significant differences between the panic patients and the comparison subjects (P = 0.021 and 0.014, respectively). The present study provides new and important evidence that variation in the PBR gene influences susceptibility to PD.",

Rather, patients with mixed states comprised a subgroup of the examined patient cohorts. Nevertheless, the data show that acute mixed states do not respond favourably to lithium. Instead, valproate and olanzapine are drugs of first choice. Carbamazepine may play a role in the prevention of mixed states. Antidepressants should be avoided, because they may worsen intraepisodic mood lability. Lamotrigine may be useful in treating mixed states with predominantly depressive symptoms.",

    "70": "In the mammalian CNS, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) express most neurotransmitter receptors, but their function remains unclear. The current studies suggest a physiological role for glutamate (AMPA and/or kainate) receptors in OPC migration. AMPA stimulated alphav integrin-mediated OPC migration by increasing both the rate of cell movement and the frequency of Ca2+ transients. A protein complex containing the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and alphav integrin modulated the AMPA-stimulated migration, and stimulation of OPC AMPA receptors resulted in increased association of the AMPA receptor subunits themselves with the alphav integrin/PLP complex. Thus, after AMPA receptor stimulation, an alphav integrin/PLP/neurotransmitter receptor protein complex forms that reduces binding to the extracellular matrix and enhances OPC migration. To assess the extent to which PLP was involved in the AMPA-stimulated migration, OPCs from the myelin-deficient (MD) rat, which has a PLP gene mutation, were analyzed. OPCs from the MD rat had a normal basal migration rate, but AMPA did not stimulate the migration of these cells, suggesting that the PLP/alphav integrin complex was important for the AMPA-mediated induction. AMPA-induced modulation of OPC migration was abolished by pertussis toxin, although baseline migration was normal. Thus, G-protein-dependent signaling is crucial for AMPA-stimulated migration of OPCs but not for basal OPC migration. Other signaling pathways involved in this AMPA-stimulated OPC migration were also determined. These studies highlight novel signaling determinants of OPC migration and suggest that glutamate could play a pivotal role in regulating integrin-mediated OPC migration.", 
    "71": "Vertigo is a sensation of movement when no movement is actually occurring. It is often accompanied by visceral autonomic symptoms including pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Vertigo is similar to motion sickness in that both may be caused by vestibular stimulation that does not match an internal model of expected environmental stimuli. Indeed, a functioning vestibular system is necessary for the perception of motion sickness. For this reason, many of the same drugs are used to treat both conditions. The investigation of drugs that treat motion sickness helps to discover medications that may treat vertigo caused by disease of the vestibular system. In this article, we discuss the pharmacologic agents that are now available for the treatment of vertigo and those agents that are still under study.",

Riparin III (ripIII) was administered orally, in male mice, at single doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg. The results showed that ripIII, at both doses, had no effects on the spontaneous motor activity in the rota rod test nor in the number of squares crossed in the open field test. However, riparin III decreased the number of grooming and rearing. In the plus maze test, ripIII, at both doses increased the following parameters: percentage of entries in the open arms (PEOA), time of permanence in the open arms (TPOA) and percentage of time of permanence in the open arms (PTOA) and at the dose of 50 mg/kg, increased the number of entries in the open arms (NEOA). Similarly, ripIII, at both doses, showed an increase in the number of head dips into the holes of the hole board test.

In rodents, comparable effects are found after exposure to stress. These autonomic parameters can give important information on stress and anxiety responses in mice. In the present experiments, stress reactivity of three frequently used mouse strains [129 Sv/Ev, Swiss Webster (SW) and C57 BL/6] was assessed using their autonomic stress responses. BT, HR and activity were telemetrically measured. Undisturbed circadian rhythms already showed clear differences between the mouse strains. Hereafter, autonomic responses to stressors with increasing intensity were measured. Strain differences were found in magnitude and duration of the stress responses, especially after high-intensity stressors. Generally, C57BL/6 mice showed the largest autonomic response, SW the lowest and the 129Sv/Ev the intermediate response. Interestingly, the observed ranking in autonomic stress response does not match the behavioral stress responsivity of these strains. Finally, sensitivity to the anxiolytic diazepam (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg) was tested using the stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm. Pharmacological sensitivity to diazepam differed between the strains with the 129Sv/Ev being most sensitive.

This decrease was only partly compensated for by an increase in the sales of nitrazepam (from 5.0 to 6.0 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day). During the years 1999 to 2004 there was a steady increase in the sales of benzodiazepine-related hypnotics (zopiclone and zolpidem). This shift could mean a change from flunitrazepam to zopiclone. The withdrawal of Rohypnol in August 2004 had only minor effects on the total sales of flunitrazepam. The decline in sales of Rohypnol was almost compensated for by the increase in the overall sales of Flunipam. This was reflected in the fact that in the later months of 2004 there were many new (incident) users of Flunipam, but few new users of flunitrazepam-containing drugs in total. It could be concluded that the restrictions on prescription status of flunitrazepam had a much higher impact than the withdrawal of the Rohypnol brand.",

The use of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone has significantly improved the control of acute CINV, but delayed nausea and vomiting remains a significant clinical problem. Two new agents, palonosetron and aprepitant, have recently been approved for the prevention of both acute and delayed CINV. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a longer half-life and a higher binding affinity than first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Aprepitant is the first agent available in the new drug class of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1) antagonists. There are a number of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and NK-1 receptor antagonists currently in Phase II and III clinical trials. Revised antiemetic guidelines for the prevention of CINV are reviewed. Future studies may consider the use of palonosetron and aprepitant with current and other new agents (olanzapine, gabapentin) in moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy, as well as in the clinical settings of multiple-day chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.", 
    "113": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder that is estimated to affect 10% of Americans. However, it remains largely undiagnosed and untreated by clinicians. The primary symptoms of this condition are leg discomfort or an urge to move that is temporarily relieved by movement and is worse at rest and at bedtime. RLS impacts the quality of life of the sufferer by disrupting sleep and disturbing or curtailing work and social activities. Approximately 80% of RLS sufferers also have periodic limb movements during sleep, in which repetitive leg movements fragment sleep and may result in daytime drowsiness. RLS may be treated by dopaminergic agents, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants and opiates; dopamine agonists are currently considered first-line therapy for this condition. Pramipexole has been studied in the treatment of RLS since 1998. This article reviews the role of this medication in the management of this serious neurological disorder.", 
    "114": "There is retrospective evidence of a correlation between psychosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and temporal lobe pathology. A 35-year-old woman with MS presented with psychosis. There was no concurrent history of medication/substance use or family history. Comparison with previous MRI scans showed significant progression of lesions within the periventricular white matter of the left temporal lobe. This case highlights the association of psychosis and MS progression with worsening of left temporal lobe lesions. Prospective studies are required to ascertain the extent to which left temporal lobe lesions are predictive of future psychosis.", 
    "115": "The newer atypical antipsychotics have gained prominence as first-line oral agents to treat severe agitation, but their use in the psychiatric emergency service (PES) setting has been limited because of the unavailability of parenteral formulations. The advent of parenteral formulations of atypical antipsychotics, beginning with ziprasidone in 2002, might afford an alternative treatment option.", 
    "116": "The objective of this article was to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of i.m. ziprasidone used to treat agitation in elderly patients.", 
    "117": "In this data analysis, the PES database at the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, School of Medicine, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York, was searched for records of patients aged > or = 65 years who received a single 20-mg dose of i.m. ziprasidone for the treatment of acute agitation. Efficacy data from these patients were compared with those from an age- and gender-matched sample that received conventional treatment (CT group) with i.m. haloperidol, with or without lorazepam. Data were also included from a previous naturalistic outcomes study to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of i.m. ziprasidone in patients treated at the PES at Stony Brook. Additional records were identified using a search of pharmacy and restraint records for PES-treated geriatric patients who received i.m. ziprasidone over a 2.5-year period beginning in late 2002, when i.m. ziprasidone became available. In some patients in the ziprasidone group, the effects of the drug on agitation were assessed prospectively by blinded psychiatrists using the Behavioural Activity Rating Scale (BARS) (1--difficult or unable to arouse to 7--violent, requires restraint). Also included in the analysis were data concerning use of rescue medication (oral or parenteral) other than the study drug within 2 hours of initial treatment, restraint time, and adverse events (changes in vital sign measurements and electrocardiography [ECG]).", 
    "118": "The database revealed 15 patients who received ziprasidone (9 men, 6 women; age range, 65-87 years) and 20 patients who were included in the CT sample (13 men, 7 women; age range, 65-88 years). In the 6 cases rated on the BARS, the mean (SE) baseline score was high (6.8 [0.1]), with a decrease to 4.0 (0.4) (P < 0.05) at 45 minutes after study drug administration and to 2.8 (0.4) (P < 0.01) at 120 minutes. Rescue medication was needed in 4 ziprasidone cases and 2 CT cases (P = NS), and mean (SE) restraint times did not vary significantly between groups (ziprasidone [n = 12], 85 [15] minutes; CT [n = 17], 83 [12] minutes). No clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate were noted, and no cardiac or other adverse events were reported. ECG results with ziprasidone (n = 3) or CT (n = 6) were unremarkable.", 
    "119": "The results of this data analysis of the effects of i.m. ziprasidone suggest that this agent was similarly effective compared with CT and was well tolerated in this geriatric population with acute agitation presenting to a PES. Ziprasidone might be an effective, well-tolerated treatment option for acute agitation in elderly patients presenting to a PES.", 
    "120": "Outbred Sprague-Dawley rats can be classified as high responders (HR) or low responders (LR) based on their levels of exploratory locomotion in a novel environment. While this novelty-seeking dimension was originally related to differential vulnerability to substance abuse, behavioral, neuroendocrine and gene expression studies suggest a fundamental difference in emotional reactivity between these animals. Here, we report the first study to selectively breed rats based on this novelty-seeking dimension. Response to novelty was clearly heritable, with a > 2-fold difference in behavior seen after eight generations of selection. Three tests of anxiety-like behavior consistently showed significantly greater anxiety in LR-bred rats compared to HR-bred animals, and this difference was diminished in the open field test by administration of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine drug, chlordiazepoxide. Cross-fostering revealed that responses to novelty were largely unaffected by maternal interactions, though there was an effect on anxiety-like behavior. These selected lines will enable future research on the interplay of genetic, environmental and developmental variables in controlling drug seeking behavior, stress and emotional reactivity.", 
    "121": "Dysphagia is seldom caused by tetanus; however, it is a common symptom of tetanus. Treating patients with tetanus is a rare event in industrialized countries and awareness is needed to recognize early signs of this serious disease. In Switzerland, the most recently reported tetanus cases occurred in elderly women with insufficient seroprotection.", 
    "122": "We report on three elderly women presenting with dysphagia as an initial symptom of tetanus.", 
    "123": "Generalized tetanus was diagnosed in two patients upon admission, the third presented with cephalic tetanus with secondary generalization. All three patients had undetectable levels of tetanus antibodies and had no documented prior tetanus immunizations. Cultures of wound swabs grew Clostridium tetani in all cases. Electromyography was highly suggestive for tetanus in two patients. Treatment involved mechanical ventilation, intravenous benzodiazepine and metronidazole therapy, and active and passive tetanus immunization. The disease had a favorable outcome in two cases and was fatal in one.",

    "125": "The consumption of allopathic tranquilizers (benzodiazepines) has social and cultural dimensions, not being restricted to a relation between physician and patient. Therefore, we aimed to show that the consumption of tranquilizers is particularized according to the social and cultural contexts their consumers are involved in. Using a qualitative approach with semistructured interviews, we search for conceptions about allopathic tranquilizers in 18 elderly women, psychiatric patients attended to in the Mental Health Centre of the Health Teaching Centre at the, University of S\u00e3o Paulo at Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School, (FMRP-USP), in the city of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (SP), Brazil, who were consumers of benzodiazepines for more than one year. We concluded that the consumption of tranquilizers is entangled in a network of social relations, including neighbors, relatives and friends. The interviewed women showed to have autonomy, feeling able to use, indicate, offer and lend, or not, these medicines, according to their conceptions.", 
    "126": "A fatality due to ingestion of flurazepam is reported. Flurazepam is a benzodiazepine, a widely prescribed hypnotic drug for use in sleep disorders. There are only few documented reports of the disposition of flurazepam in deaths due to overdose. A 68-year-old woman was found deceased at home with no evidence of trauma or asphyxia. Toxicologic analyses were performed and drug levels measured by means of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The flurazepam concentration in each specimen was as follows: heart blood 2.8 microg/mL, bile 323 microg/mL, and urine 172 microg/mL. Presence of flurazepam into gastric content was observed too. Based on the autopsy findings, patient history, and toxicologic results, the cause of death was determined to be acute intoxication of flurazepam and the manner, suicide.", 
    "127": "Turkey is located on the main overland connection between Asia and Europe, making the country potentially vulnerable to drug trafficking and its associated harms. The aim of the present study is to explore the frequency of all deaths from drug overdose and toxicity in Turkey and to describe some of the characteristics of these deaths. We collected data on all deaths from drugs in Turkey between 1997 and 2001 using records from the Council of Forensic Medicine. Data obtained from autopsy reports were retrospectively analyzed. In the present study, 374 deaths from drugs were reported in Turkey, with a mortality rate of 0.17 per 100,000 population. Highest mortality rates were found in Istanbul (0.83) and Gaziantep (0.71). The mean age was 34.0, and most cases (71.7%) were below the age of 40. The proportion of female cases was 13.6%. Opiates were implicated in 91.5% of deaths and benzodiazepines in 25.9%. Two fifths (38.8%) of the cases involved use of more than 1 drug. In 36.6% of cases, the route of final drug administration was by injection. The most common location of death was at a home (33.7%). Interventions to reduce drug use nationally are urgently required. International cooperation in social-educational activities, scientific research, and security measures is essential for this war.", 
    "128": "The neuronal death after ischemia is closely linked to the essential role of mitochondrial metabolism. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain reduces ATP generation leading to a dysregulation of ion metabolism. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) influences the maintenance of key mitochondrial proteins for maximum energy production and it may play a neuroprotective role in some pathological conditions. In this study we have analyzed ALC-mediated neuroprotection on an in vitro model of brain ischemia. Field potential recordings were obtained from a rat corticostriatal slice preparation. In vitro ischemia (oxygen and glucose deprivation) was delivered by switching to a solution in which glucose was omitted and oxygen was replaced with N2. Ten minutes of in vitro ischemia caused an irreversible loss of the field potential amplitude. Pretreatment with ALC produced a progressive and dose-dependent recovery of the field potential amplitude following in vitro ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of ALC was stereospecific since the pretreatment with two different carnitine-related compounds did not cause neuroprotection. The choline transporter inhibitor hemicholinium-3 blocked the neuroprotective effect of ALC. ALC-mediated neuroprotection was also prevented either by the non-selective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, or by the putative M2-like receptor antagonist methoctramine. Conversely, the effect of ALC was not altered by the M1-like receptor antagonist pirenzepine. These findings show that ALC exert a neuroprotective action against in vitro ischemia. This neuroprotective effect requires the activity of choline uptake system and the activation of M2 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "129": "Humans need to monitor their actions continuously to detect errors as fast as possible and to adjust their performance to prevent future errors. This process of action monitoring can be investigated by measuring the error-related negativity (ERN), an ERP component elicited immediately after an error. In the current study, we investigated action monitoring after administration of the classic antipsychotic haloperidol (2.5 mg), the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (10 mg), and the antidepressant paroxetine (20 mg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Healthy volunteers (N = 14) were administered the three compounds and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, four-way cross-over design. All participants performed a speeded two-choice reaction task, while event-related potentials and behavioral measurements were obtained. Both haloperidol and olanzapine significantly reduced ERN amplitudes. After paroxetine, the ERN was not different from placebo. N2 congruency effects were not affected by treatment condition. Only olanzapine demonstrated behavioral effects, namely a slowing of responses, an increase in error rates, and the absence of performance adjustments. The attenuated ERNs after the dopamine antagonist haloperidol are in line with the presumed role of dopamine in action monitoring. Haloperidol is thought to block dopaminergic signaling, thus reducing ERN amplitudes. On the other hand, the effects of olanzapine are mainly caused by its sedative side effects, leading to a decline in motivation and appraisal of errors. Finally, the absence of any effects after paroxetine suggests that serotonin transmission does not play a direct role in regulating mechanisms related to action monitoring.", 
    "130": "Alcohol dependence is a major risk factor for suicidal behavior. Although a number of risk factors have been suggested there is still no well-defined risk profile for attempted suicide in alcoholic patients. Alterations of serum lipids have been associated with completed as well as attempted suicide and with suicidal ideation. This study investigated potential demographic and clinical risk factors for attempted suicide in alcohol-dependent patients taking serum lipids additionally into consideration.", 
    "131": "One-hundred ten alcohol-dependent patients who were admitted to a psychiatric university hospital department for inpatient treatment were grouped according to whether or not they had a lifetime history of attempted suicide. Attempters versus nonattempters as well as attempters who used a violent versus a nonviolent suicide method were compared.", 
    "132": "Patients who had attempted suicide at least once in their life differed significantly from those who had no history of suicide attempts. Univariate analyses showed that they were younger (41.7 years vs 46.8 years; p = 0.003), were more often smokers (97% vs 77%; p = 0.011), had more frequently coabused benzodiazepines (54% vs 17%; p = 0.002), and scored currently higher on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) global scale (26.3 vs 20.2; p = 0.005) as well as the \"suicidal thoughts\" item (1.8 vs 0.6; p = 0.001). Additionally, they had higher serum triglyceride levels (178.9 vs 127.5; p = 0.039). A logistic regression analysis left coabuse of benzodiazepines [odds ratio (OR), 5.26; p = 0.001], younger age (OR per year increase of age, 0.91; p = 0.006), and current MADRS item 10 (\"suicidal thoughts\") score (OR per point increase in MADRS item 10 score, 1.43; p = 0.019) as significant factors. Suicide attempters who had used a violent method were significantly more often male (82% vs 44%; p = 0.035), were younger (38.2% vs 45.1 years; p = 0.008), and had less frequently coabused tranquilizers (35% vs 78%; p = 0.018) than nonviolent attempters.",

    "134": "Glutamate is an important regulator of dendrite development that may inhibit, (during ischemic injury), or facilitate (during early development) dendrite growth. Previous studies have reported mainly on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated dendrite growth-promoting effect of glutamate. In this study, we examined how the non-NMDA receptor agonist kainate influenced dendrite growth. E18 mouse cortical neurons were grown for 3 days in vitro and immunolabeled with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and anti-neurofilament (NF-H), to identify dendrites and axons, respectively. Exposure of cortical neurons to kainate increased dendrite growth without affecting neuron survival. This effect was dose-dependent, reversible and blocked by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX and the low-affinity kainate receptor antagonist NS-102, but not by the AMPA receptor antagonist CFM-2. In addition, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 had no effect on kainate-induced dendrite growth. Immunolabeling and Western blot analysis of kainate receptors using antibodies against the GluR6 and KA2 subunits, demonstrated that the immature cortical neurons used in this study express kainate receptor proteins. These results suggest that kainate-induced non-NMDA receptor activation promotes dendrite growth, and in particular primary dendrite number and length, from immature cortical neurons in vitro, and that kainate receptors may be directly involved in this process. Furthermore, these data support the possibility that like NMDA receptors, kainate receptor activation may also contribute to early neurite growth from cortical neurons in vitro.", 
    "135": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome due to hepatic dysfunction and porto-systemic shunting of the intestinal blood. Cirrhosis is the most frequent liver disease causing HE. On most occasions, HE appears due to a superimposed precipitating factor (gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, renal and electrolyte disturbances, etc.). Ammonia produced in colon by intestinal bacteria is the main toxic substance implicated in the pathogenesis of HE. Other mechanisms, such as changes in the GABA-benzodiazepine system, accumulation of manganese into the basal ganglia of the brain, changes in blood-brain barrier and neurotransmission disturbances are also present. Clinical manifestations of HE may vary widely, from minimal neurologic changes, only detected with specific tests, to deep coma. Treatment of HE should be directed to controlling the precipitating factors, as well as therapies aimed at correcting the above-mentioned pathophysiological changes, mainly reduction of blood ammonia levels. Artificial liver support systems may play a role in the future. Liver transplantation should be evaluated as a definitive therapy in all cases of HE.",

    "140": "Male Swiss albinos mice were submitted to two behavioural tests intended to determine their anxiety level: the elevated plus-maze test as well as the black and white compartments test. In addition they were submitted to the hole-board test. It was observed: (i) that the correlation between scores in the two first tests was weak, suggesting that they explore different components of anxiety; (ii) that the score on the latter test was better correlated with the response in the elevated plus-maze test than in the black and white compartments test. From these data three groups of animals were constituted, considered, respectively, as anxious, non anxious and intermediates. It was observed that both horizontal and vertical locomotion in an unfamiliar environment differed between groups, with higher activity in non anxious than in anxious. In the hole-board test, only animals classified as anxious displayed an obvious response to the anxiolytic drug diazepam (0.5mg/kg). Finally in the forced-swimming test, the three groups demonstrated a similar immobility time, suggesting that the operated segregation was not depending on a helpless component. It is proposed that the selection of mice from a combination of either elevated plus-maze and black and white compartments tests or a combination of hole-board test and black and white compartments test, allows to distinguish high or low anxiety animals among a population of mice.",

    "142": "Quantitative EEG (frequency analysis, absolute and relative powers of the four classical bands) was assessed in 191 male alcoholic patients admitted in our facility for detoxification process. All underwent psychiatric, medical and neurological examination prior to the EEG recording, in search for specific clinical or paraclinical findings. The presence or absence of relevant clinical features was codified as nominal dichotomic variables to be related to specific QEEG features.", 
    "143": "Only 7 patients had normal QEEG. The most frequent alteration (81 cases) was decreased power in slow (delta and theta) bands with a concurrent increase in beta band, followed by decreased power only in slow bands (33), increase only in beta band (29), decrease in both slow and alpha bands without beta alterations (28), decrease only in alpha band (6) and others. Alterations in slow and beta bands were uncorrelated. However, a significant correlation was found between decreased power in slow bands and cortical atrophy as revealed by MRI (especially in patients with early onset of alcoholism), time elapsed from the beginning of alcoholic habits (but only in younger or early onset subjects) and in a lesser degree arterial hypertension, but neither with age nor any other clinical or psychiatric feature. On the other hand, increased power in beta band correlated mainly with the use of benzodiazepines, sensoperceptual alterations (hallucinations, illusions), clinical seizures and family history of alcoholism. The effects of those variables were strongly interrelated.",

    "146": "The previous exploration of the structure-affinity relationships concerning 4-phenyl-2-quinolinecarboxamide peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands 6 showed as an interesting result the importance of the presence of a chlorine atom in the methylene carbon at position 3 of the quinoline nucleus. The subnanomolar PBR affinity shown by N-benzyl-3-chloromethyl-N-methyl-4-phenyl-2-quinolinecarboxamide (6b) suggested its chlorine atom to be replaced with other halogens in order to optimize the interaction of the quinolinecarboxamide derivatives with PBR and to develop suitable candidates for positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. The binding studies led to the discovery of fluoromethyl derivative 6a, which showed an IC50 value of 0.11 nM and is, therefore, one of the most potent PBR ligands so far described. Fluoromethyl derivative 6a has been labeled with 11C (t1/2=20.4 min, beta+=99.8%) starting from the corresponding des-methyl precursor (14) using [11C]CH3I in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in DMF with a 35-40% radiochemical yield (corrected for decay) and 1.5 Ci/micromol of specific radioactivity. Ex vivo rat biodistribution and inhibition (following intravenous pre-administration of PK11195) studies showed that [11C]6a rapidly and specifically accumulated in PBR-rich tissues such as heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and adrenal, and at a lower level in other peripheral organs and in the brain. The images obtained in mouse with small animal YAP-(S)PET essentially confirmed the result of the ex vivo biodistribution experiments. The biological data suggest that [11C]6a is a promising radioligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptor PET imaging in vivo.",

We used Cox regression models to compute hazards ratios (HRs) of having the treatment discontinued and logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ORs) among persisting patients of having any concomitant antipsychotic prescription. All models were adjusted for age, sex, schizophrenia disorder, comorbidity, region, beneficiary type, substance use disorder, and prior hospitalization for mental illness.",

Role of ghrelin (RIA), resistin and TNF-alpha (ELISA) in weight gain and insulin resistance (fasting plasma insulin, HOMA, ELISA) was studied in Hungarian psychiatryic patients (n=60) treated with SGA (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, 15 each). After 1 year, 80% of patients became overweight/obese (BMI > 27/30) and 35% (n= 21/60) presented impaired glucose tolerance (13/60) or diabetes (8/60). Ghrelin (1.3 +/- 0.6 ng/ml), resistin (9.8 +/- 3.7 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (5.8 +/- 1.7 pg/ml), insulin (10.4 +/- 7.6 U/ml, HOMA A: 2.5 +/- 1.8, HOMA B: 133 +/- 62.5) were significantly higher in patients than in healthy matched controls. Resistin and TNF-alpha positively correlated with each other, insulin, HOMA, and negatively with ghrelin. Ghrelin contributes to weight gain, resistin and TNF-alpha to insulin resistance. A negative feedback regulation may exist between adipocytokines and ghrelin production. SGA drugs enhance ghrelin production despite the suppressive effect of adipocytokines. All four SGA drugs are equally obesitogenic and diabetogenic.", 
    "153": "The present work consists of studies of saturated and supersaturated solutions of diazepam (DZP) in [glycofurol (GF)/water] cosolvent systems, which are a potential dosage form for intranasal administration of DZP in rapid response to epileptic seizure emergencies. Equilibrium solubility of DZP increased in a convex manner with GF content, and also increased with temperature. Rapidly mixed supersaturated 40 mg/mL solutions displayed temporal stability, with long periods before onset of crystallization. Permeation of supersaturated DZP across polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes, chosen as an in vitro model for nasal mucosa, was shown to be well described by Theeuwes's transference equation, when DZP was formulated up to three times its solubility in a particular cosolvent vehicle. Transference and time lag were independent of vehicle composition, indicating that permeation enhancement was due virtually exclusively to enhanced driving force due to supersaturation. Implications of these results on potential intranasal DZP delivery systems based on supersaturation are discussed.",

We present a 62 years old male patient who was admitted to our institution because of sudden onset of mild hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, stupor, leucocytosis and massive rhabdomyolysis after 30 years uneventful treatment with clozapine. The medication with clozapine was suspended because of the suspicion of NMS. When the acute symptoms were abated, the treatment with clozapine was resumed again after 14 days. The very next day, the patient suffered again from raised body core temperature, leucocytosis, elevated serum creatine kinase and new catatonia. The therapy with clozapine was stopped definitively and benzodiazepines were administered assuming a relapse of an alleviated, probably reconvening NMS. Under the treatment with benzodiazepines the patient was free of symptoms even after 1 month. To our knowledge, the latency of 30 years between the beginning of the treatment with clozapine and the onset of NMS is the longest period in the literature. According to our case, the differential diagnosis of NMS is not always trivial and is therefore discussed.",

    "160": "Chronically, olanzapine or clozapine was self-administered via cookie dough to rodents (Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats; C57Bl/6J or A/J mice). Chronic studies measured food intake, body weight, adiponectin, active ghrelin, leptin, insulin, tissue wet weights, glucose, clinical chemistry endpoints, and brain dopaminergic D2 receptor density. Acute studies examined food intake, ghrelin, leptin, and glucose tolerance.", 
    "161": "Olanzapine (1 to 8 mg/kg), but not clozapine, increased body weight in female rats only. Weight changes were detectable within 2 to 3 days and were associated with hyperphagia starting approximately 24 hours after the first dose. Chronic administration (12 to 29 days) led to adiposity, hyperleptinemia, and mild insulin resistance; no lipid abnormalities or changes in D2 receptor density were observed. Topiramate, which has reversed weight gain from atypical antipsychotics in humans, attenuated weight gain in rats. Acutely, olanzapine, but not clozapine, lowered plasma glucose and leptin. Increases in glucose, insulin, and leptin following a glucose challenge were also blunted.", 
    "162": "A model of olanzapine-induced obesity was characterized which shares characteristics of patients with atypical antipsychotic drug-induced obesity; these characteristics include hyperphagia, hyperleptinemia, insulin resistance, and weight gain attenuation by topiramate. This model may be a useful and inexpensive model of uncomplicated obesity amenable to rapid screening of weight loss drugs. Olanzapine-induced weight gain may be secondary to hyperphagia associated with acute lowering of plasma glucose and leptin, as well as the inability to increase plasma glucose and leptin following a glucose challenge.", 
    "163": "In this in vitro study we examined the effects of diazepam on a phenylephrine-induced contraction in rat aorta and determined the associated cellular mechanism focusing on the endothelium-derived vasodilators. The concentration-response curves for phenylephrine and potassium chloride were generated in the presence or absence of diazepam. Phenylephrine concentration-response curves were generated from the endothelium-intact rings pretreated independently with N(W)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, PK 11195, tetraethylammonium, and indomethacin in the presence or absence of diazepam. Diazepam (7 x 10(-7) M) attenuated the phenylephrine-induced contraction in the endothelium-intact rings, whereas a large dose (5 x 10(-6) M) of diazepam attenuated the phenylephrine-induced contraction in the aortic rings with or without the endothelium. A pretreatment with the N(W)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester completely abolished the diazepam (7 x 10(-7) M)-induced attenuation of the phenylephrine concentration-response curve, as well as the diazepam (5 x 10(-6) M)-induced attenuation of the maximal contractile response to phenylephrine. The N(W)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-4) M)-induced contraction was enhanced in the rings pretreated with diazepam (5 x 10(-6) M). These results indicate that a supraclinical concentration of diazepam attenuates phenylephrine-induced contraction by increasing endothelial nitric oxide activity and directly affecting vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "164": "Diazepam inhibits phosphodiesterase type 4 and enhances the effect of some 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent positive inotropic drugs. We sought to determine whether diazepam and the selective phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor rolipram enhances the contractile response and cAMP levels induced by dopamine in rat myocardium. Dopamine (3-100 microM) produced concentration-dependent positive inotropic effects (-log EC50 = 5.21 +/- 0.2, n = 5), which were augmented in the presence of 10 microM diazepam (-log EC50 = 5.40 +/- 0.08, n = 6, P < 0.05) or 1 microM rolipram (-log EC50 = 5.41 +/- 0.1, n = 6, P < 0.05). The effect of diazepam was not mimicked by 100 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid nor it was antagonized by a 5 microM concentration of the blockers of central and peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, flumazenil and PK 11195. cAMP levels (pmol/g) produced by dopamine (744.4 +/- 111.8, n = 5) in this tissue were enhanced by the presence of diazepam (1073 +/- 97.7, n = 6, P < 0.05) or rolipram (1034.0 +/- 245.2, n = 5, P < 0.05). Therefore, diazepam, like rolipram, augments the inotropic and biochemical effects of dopamine in rat myocardium. This effect is not mediated by benzodiazepine receptors but is probably the consequence of the phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitory activity of diazepam.",

Blood and urine samples were taken at admission. Detection of benzodiazepines in serum and urine was achieved by the fluorescence polarisation method. Concordance in benzodiazepine findings between medical records and laboratory results was estimated by calculating the degree of agreement (kappa) and described graphically using a Venn diagram.",

Thirty percent of the patients reported that they used hypnotics. Benzodiazepine in serum or urine was detected in 83 (37%) patients. Over half of the patients coming from residential homes (53%) and institutions (54%) were benzodiazepine-positive. For home dwellers the proportion of patients that were benzodiazepine-positive was 29%. In 48% (40/83) of the benzodiazepine-positive patients, the type of benzodiazepine could not be identified because of a lack of drug records regarding benzodiazepines. A total of 113 (51%) patients used benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-related drugs when both laboratory results and medical drug records were taken into account. Thirty-nine percent of these patients were home dwellers, 69% came from residential care and 76% from institutional care. The concordance between medical records and laboratory results expressed as overlap area was 32% in men and 59% in women, 38% in community-dwelling patients, 63% in residential home patients, and 68% in patients from institutions.",

The highest prevalences were found in institutional and residential care where it should be well known that the use of CNS drugs increases the risk of hip fracture. Concordance of benzodiazepine findings was moderate in all patients and poorest among men. Concordance was poorer among home dwellers than among those living in residential homes and institutions. Analysing benzodiazepine in serum seems to be the most reliable method for ascertaining benzodiazepine exposure. This laboratory test could be performed routinely when the elderly patient is admitted to hospital because of a fall or, at least, in case of hip fracture. Then, if needed, the patient should be informed about the risks of benzodiazepine use, and further falls and fractures could be prevented.",

Moreover, as in adults underlying medical or psychiatric conditions may play an important pathogenetic role. Therefore the management of the sleep problems necessitates a highly differenciated diagnostic effort prior to any concrete treatment step. In general consultation of the parents may be a sufficient measure. However in severe and chronified courses behavior therapy combined with pharmacotherapy can be successful. Only few studies on efficacy and side effects on sleep-inducing pharmacologic agents exist. The most prescribed substances are antihistamines, neuroleptics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines. On the other hand their use is limited because of side effects, tolerance and impaired vigilance functions. Recently studies on melatonin suggest that this substance might become an effective and well tolerable treatment alternative. This article discusses problems and indications of pharmacotherapy in children's sleep disorders and highlights the importance of its integration in a differenciated treatment concept.",

In the present study, the anxiolytic effects of baicalin alone and in combination with other anxiolytics were tested in mice using the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Baicalin treatment (7.5 - 30 mg/kg) significantly increased entries into and time spent in open arms, indicative of an anxiolytic-like effect. Motor-depressive and myorelaxant side effects commonly associated with anxiolytics were not observed with baicalin at effective anxiolytic doses in the hole-board and horizontal wire tests, respectively. Co-administration of baicalin (3.75 mg/kg) with dl-tetrahydropalmatine ( dl-THP; 0.25 mg/kg), an anxiolytic-hypnotic alkaloid, both at sub-effective doses, induced an additive effect resulting in considerable anxiolysis. Similarly, an additive anxiolytic-like effect was observed with baicalin (3.75 mg/kg) and diazepam (DZ; 0.5 mg/kg). Results obtained from this study demonstrate the potential of baicalin as a candidate anxiolytic and its possible application in multidrug therapy. Abbreviations.

As cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors inhibit the PGE(2) production and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we performed a therapeutic trial with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. In a prospective, double-blind, add-on study, 40 patients suffering from an acute depressive episode were randomly assigned to either reboxetine and celecoxib or to reboxetine plus placebo. After a wash-out period, 20 patients received 4-10 mg reboxetine plus placebo and 20 received reboxetine plus 400 mg celecoxib for 6 weeks. The treatment effect was calculated by analysis of variance. There were no significant differences between groups in age, sex, duration or severity of disease or psychopathology, or reboxetine dose or plasma levels. Over 6 weeks, both groups of patients showed significant improvement in scores of the Hamilton Depression Scale. However, the celecoxib group showed significantly greater improvement compared to the reboxetine-alone group. Additional treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic action of reboxetine with regard to depressive symptomatology. Moreover, the fact that treatment with an anti-inflammatory drug showed beneficial effects on MD indicates that inflammation is related to the pathomechanism of the disorder, although the exact mechanisms remain to become elucidated.",

    "179": "This open-label, prospective, 4-month study in hyperprolactinemic patients with schizophrenia explored whether prolactin levels decrease after switching antipsychotic therapy to olanzapine. A secondary objective was to determine if reproductive morbidities and sexual dysfunction occurring with hyperprolactinemia improved with prolactin normalization. Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, who had hyperprolactinemia defined as >18.8 ng/ml for males and >24.2 ng/ml for females, were randomized to: remain on current therapy (n=27) or switch to olanzapine, 5-20 mg/day, (n=27). Baseline prolactin levels in female patients randomized to receive olanzapine (n=14) were 66.3+/-38.7 ng/ml and were 82.0+/-37.6 (p=.32) in those remaining on their pre-study antipsychotic medication (n=14). In male patients, baseline prolactin levels were 33.7+/-12.1 and 33.5+/-13.8 ng/ml (p=.97), respectively, for those randomized to olanzapine (n=13) or remaining on pre-study treatment (n=13). At study end, patients switched to olanzapine experienced significant reductions in mean serum prolactin levels of 19.8+/-18.1 ng/ml in males (p=.02), and 32.3+/-47.5 ng/ml in females (p=.01), but prolactin continued to be elevated in patients who remained on pre-study antipsychotic treatment. After switching to olanzapine treatment, male patients experienced significantly (p=.03) increased free testosterone levels but there were no significant improvements in total testosterone levels; some female patients experienced improved menstrual cycling, as well as resolution of galactorrhea and gynecomastia, and sexual functioning was significantly improved in both genders. Patients switched to olanzapine, as well as those remaining on their pre-study medication, maintained clinical stability, their symptoms continued to improve, although there were no significant between-treatment differences in improvement. Treatment-emergent adverse events did occur in both treatment groups; however, they were not significantly different between groups. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced significantly lower eosinophil counts and higher elevations in low-density lipoproteins and standing blood pressure than non-switched patients. Olanzapine treatment may offer sustained reduction in serum prolactin and improvement in sexual and reproductive comorbid symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who have treatment-emergent hyperprolactinemia.", 
    "180": "The most severe forms of conduct disorder (CD) are highly stable and disabling disorders, more likely to persist in time and to evolve into disruptive or antisocial behaviors. One crucial issue in the prognosis of these forms of CD is the high resistance to both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, with antipsychotic drugs being frequently used in refractory cases. Aim of this study was: (1) to explore efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine treatment in adolescents with severe CD; (2) to identify predictors of olanzapine treatment outcome. This was a retrospective study, based on clinical records of the first 23 adolescents diagnosed as having a CD, diagnosed with a clinical interview (K-SADS), either pure or with comorbid diagnoses, and treated with olanzapine. All these patients did not respond satisfactorily to non-pharmacological intervention and to adequate dosages of mood stabilizers (lithium and/or valproate). The sample consisted of 16 males and seven females, 16 inpatients and seven outpatients (mean age 13.6 +/- 1.9 years, range 11-17.2 years), followed-up for a period ranging from 6 to 12 months (mean 8.8 +/- 2.7 months). Outcome measures included the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and Children Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). During the follow-up, all patients were involved in non-pharmacological treatments (psychotherapy, family therapy, or day-hospital group treatments). Based on both an improvement of at least 50% at MOAS and a score 1 or 2 at CGI-I, 14 out of 23 patients (60.9%) were classified as responders at the end of the follow-up. Significant improvement at the last observation was found in MOAS (P < 0.001) and CGAS (P < 0.001) scores. Olanzapine dosage was 8 +/- 3.2 mg/day (range 5-20 mg/day). Mean weight gain at the end of the follow-up was 4.6 +/- 3 kg. The predictors of a positive treatment response was an impulsive-affective versus controlled-predatory type of aggression. Age at onset of CD and comorbid disorders did not affect treatment response. These preliminary findings suggest that olanzapine may improve behavior in adolescents with severe and treatment-refractory CD and impulsive aggression.",

A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of these agents, as both monotherapy and in combination with mood stabilisers, was performed to establish the evidence for their use. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were critically appraised in more detail than studies that presented lower levels of evidence such as case reports, case series and open label follow up studies. We found 11 RCTs reporting on patients treated with second generation antipsychotics for acute bipolar mania, of which three included randomisation between the second generation antipsychotic and placebo, and eight between a mood stabiliser combined with either the second generation antipsychotic or placebo. Data from non-randomised trials is also presented.", 
    "182": "Neurosteroids are modulators of several receptors and ion channels and are implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric diseases including hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors, accumulates in the brains of HE patients where it can potentiate GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses. Attenuation of the effects of neurosteroids on GABA-ergic neurotransmission is therefore of interest for the management of HE. In the present study, we determined the effect of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, Ro15-4513, and the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil on modulation of the GABA(A) mediated chloride currents by allopregnanolone and on spontaneous synaptic activity in cultured hippocampal neurons using the patch-clamp technique. Allopregnanolone (0.03-0.3 microM), dose-dependently potentiated GABA-induced currents, an action significantly reduced by Ro15-4513 (10 microM). In contrast, flumazenil (10 microM) had no effect on the ability of allopregnanolone to potentiate GABA(A) currents but it blocked the effects of Ro15-4513. The frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity was significantly reduced in the presence of allopregnanolone (0.1 microM) from 1.5+/-0.7 to 0.1+/-0.04Hz. This action was partially reversed by Ro15-4513 (10 microM) but was not significantly influenced by flumazenil (10 microM). These findings suggest that the beneficial affects of Ro15-4513 in experimental HE result from attenuation of the effects of neurosteroids at GABA(A) receptors. Our results may provide a rational basis for the use of benzodiazepine inverse agonists in the management and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure.", 
    "183": "Lorazepam (LOR) is a 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepine that is chiral and undergoes enantiomerization at room temperature. In humans, about 75% of the administered dose of LOR is excreted in the urine as its 30-glucuronide. CE-MS with negative ESI was used to confirm the presence of LOR-30-glucuronide in urines that stemmed from a healthy individual who ingested 1 or 2 mg LOR, whereas free LOR could be detected in extracts prepared from enzymatically hydrolyzed urines. As the 30-glucuronidation reaction occurs at the chiral center of the molecule, two diastereoisomers can theoretically be formed, molecules that can no longer interconvert. The stereoselective formation of LOR glucuronides in humans and in vitro was investigated. MEKC analysis of extracts of the nonhydrolyzed urines suggested the presence of the two different LOR glucuronides in the urine. The formation of the same two diastereoisomers was also observed in vitro employing incubations of LOR with human liver microsomes in the presence of uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronic acid as coenzyme. The absence of other coenzymes excluded the formation of phase I or other phase II metabolites of LOR. Both results revealed a stereoselectivity, one diastereoisomer being formed in a higher amount than the other. After enzymatic hydrolysis using beta-glucuronidase, these peaks could not be detected any more. Instead, LOR was monitored. Analysis of the extracts prepared from enzymatically hydrolyzed urines by MEKC in the presence of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-CD revealed the enantiomerization process of LOR (observation of two peaks of equal magnitude connected with a plateau zone). The data presented provide for the first time the evidence of the stereoselectivity of the LOR glucuronidation in humans.", 
    "184": "The cerebral distribution of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS) in human brain has been investigated by positron emission tomography (PET) with the specific radioligand [11C]PK11195 in diverse neuropathological conditions. However, little is known about the pattern of PK11195 binding sites in healthy brain. Therefore, we used quantitative autoradiography to measure the saturation binding parameters for [3H]PK11195 in cryostat sections from young Landrace pigs. Specific binding was lowest in the cerebellar white matter (85 fmol mg(-1)) and highest in the caudate nucleus (370 fmol mg(-1)), superior colliculus (400 fmol mg(-1)), and anterior thalamic nucleus (588 fmol mg(-1)). The apparent affinity was in the range of 2-6 nM in vitro, predicting high specific binding in PET studies of living brain. However, the distribution volume (V(d), ml g(-1)) of high specific activity [11C]PK11195 was nearly homogeneous (3 ml g(-1)) throughout brain of healthy Landrace pigs, and was nearly identical in studies with lower specific activity, suggesting that factors in vivo disfavor the detection of PBBS in Landrace pigs with this radioligand. In young, adult G\u00f6ttingen minipig brain, the magnitude of V(d) for [11C]PK11195 was in the range 5-10 ml g(-1), and had a heterogeneous distribution resembling the in vitro findings in Landrace pigs. There was a trend toward globally increased V(d) in a group of minipigs with acute MPTP-induced parkinsonism, but no increase in V(d) was evident in the same pigs rescanned at 2 weeks after grafting of fetal mesencephalon to the partially denervated striatum. Thus, [11C]PK11195 binding was not highly sensitive to constituitively expressed PBBS in brain of young Landrace pigs, and did not clearly demonstrate the expected microglial activation in the MPTP/xenograft model of minipigs.", 
    "185": "Three cases of drug-induced akathisia during palliative care in terminal cancer patients were reported. Antiemetics (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) possessing a central antidopaminergic effect were suspected to have caused the akathisia. Akathisia, as well as extrapyramidal symptoms, is a common and unpleasant complex neurobehavioral adverse effect of conventional antipsychotic drugs. But it is not widely recognized by general clinicians. This syndrome consists of subjective (feeling of inner restlessness, mental unease, or dysphoria and the urge to move) and objective components (restless movement, including rocking on one's feet, walking in position shuffling and tramping the legs,and crossing and uncrossing one's legs while sitting). In severe cases, patients constantly pace up and down in an attempt to relieve the sense of unrest. While the pathophysiology of drug-induced akathisia remains unknown, antagonism of the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways is a plausible if not completely satisfactory hypothesis. The notion that dopaminergic blockade underlies the emergence of akathisia is supported by the PET studies. Since akathisia is a drug-induced adverse effect, optimal management involves its prevention rather than treatment. Drugs which have been found to have some efficacy in the treatment of akathisia are anticholinergics, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines and clonidine. Though a number of other treatments have been proposed, no trial-based evidences for treatment of akathisia have been available. It is important that akathisia is recognized and treated appropriately as an adverse reaction to drugs and a further increase in antipsychotic medication dosage may further exacerbate the condition.", 
    "186": "Eight water-soluble components of aged garlic extract were evaluated to assess their potential to inhibit the activity of human cytochrome-P450 (CYP) enzymes. The in vitro model consisted of human liver microsomes with index reactions chosen to profile the activity of the following six CYP isoforms: CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A. With only 2 exceptions, none of the 8 garlic components produced >50% inhibition even at high concentrations (100 micromol/L). S-methyl-L-cysteine and S-allyl-L-cysteine at 100 micromol/L produced modest inhibition of CYP3A, reducing activity to 20-40% of control. However available clinical evidence does not indicate CYP3A inhibition in vivo. The findings suggest that drug interactions involving inhibition of CYP3A enzymes by aged garlic extract are very unlikely.", 
    "187": "A simple and fast procedure was developed for the simultaneous determination of eight benzodiazepines (BZDs) in whole blood using liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS). Sample pretreatment was carried out using a simple liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with n-butylchloride, and chromatographic separation was performed using a monolithic silica column to speed up the analytical process. APCI and electrospray ionization (ESI) were compared. Whereas both ionization techniques appeared suitable for BZDs, APCI was found to be slightly more sensitive, especially for the determination of frequently low-dosed compounds. The method was validated according to the guidelines of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise des Sciences et Techniques Pharmaceutiques\" (SFSTP) in the concentration range of 2.5-500 microg/L. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 2.5 microg/L for all the compounds. Validation data including linearity, precision, and trueness were obtained, allowing subtherapeutic quantification of frequently low-dosed BZDs. The high selectivity of the mass spectrometer, along with the properties of the monolithic support, allowed unequivocal analysis of the eight compounds in less than 5 min. To demonstrate the potential of the method, it was used for the analysis of benzodiazepines in postmortem blood samples.",

The calibration functions were all linear with the coefficient of determination (r(2)) exceeding 0.996 for the three target compounds. Using the sweeping procedure, the limits of detection were determined to be 13.4, 5.6, and 12.0ng/mL for flunitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, and N-desmethylflunitrazepam, respectively, and the sensitivity enhancement for each compound was within the range of 110-200 fold. The RSDs for the retention time and the peak area were less than 4.10%. The optimized sweeping method was also used to examine a spiked urine sample. We conclude that sweeping with micellar electrokinetic chromatography has considerable potential use in clinical and forensic analyses of flunitrazepam and its metabolites.", 
    "193": "The clinical efficacy of lidocaine for convulsive status epilepticus in 53 convulsive episodes was examined in 37 children (17 males, 20 females). Mean age of patients receiving lidocaine was 3 years 7 months (SD 3y 5mo). Lidocaine administration achieved control of status epilepticus in 19 of 53 convulsive episodes (35.8%). Seizures ceased within 5 minutes of lidocaine administration in all 19 patients who were responsive to the drug. Regarding aetiology of status epilepticus and types of seizures, there was no statistical difference in effectiveness. Mild decrease of oxygen saturation, monitored by pulse oximetry, was observed in one patient, which improved by oxygenation using a mask. Lidocaine is a useful anticonvulsive agent; however, the response rate to lidocaine appears to be quite low, as less than half of the seizures were effectively controlled by lidocaine. Favourable properties of the drug include prompt responses, less alteration of consciousness, and fewer adverse effects, including less respiratory depression."
