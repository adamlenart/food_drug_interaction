These comprised 193 cases in which cause of death involved methadone toxicity (METH) and 1000 cases in which cause of death involved heroin toxicity in the absence of methadone (HER). METH cases were significantly more likely to have benzodiazepines (63.7% vs. 32.2%), and less likely to have alcohol (23.6% vs. 42.7%) detected. METH cases were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with pre-existing systemic pathology (94.3% vs. 79.9%), and multiple organ system pathology (68.8% vs. 41.4%). Specifically, METH cases were more likely to have cardiac (58.9% vs. 34.5%), pulmonary (53.6% vs. 30.9%), hepatic (80.7% vs. 62.8%) and renal (25.0% vs. 9.5%) disease. Given the notable differences in toxicology and disease patterns, great caution appears warranted in prescribing benzodiazepines to methadone users, and regular physical examinations of methadone treatment patients would appear clinically warranted.",

    "9": "Although the role of Na(+) in several aspects of Ca(2+) regulation has already been shown, the exact mechanism of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase resulting from an enhancement in the persistent, non-inactivating Na(+) current (I(Na,P)), a decisive factor in certain forms of epilepsy, has yet to be resolved. Persistent Na(+) current, evoked by veratridine, induced bursts of action potentials and sustained membrane depolarization with monophasic intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)) and biphasic [Ca(2+)](i) increase in CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices. The Ca(2+) response was tetrodotoxin- and extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent and ionotropic glutamate receptor-independent. The first phase of [Ca(2+)](i) rise was the net result of Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels and mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration. The robust second phase in addition involved reverse operation of the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger and mitochondrial Ca(2+) release. We excluded contribution of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results demonstrate a complex interaction between persistent, non-inactivating Na(+) current and [Ca(2+)](i) regulation in CA1 pyramidal cells. The described cellular mechanisms are most likely part of the pathomechanism of certain forms of epilepsy that are associated with I(Na,P). Describing the magnitude, temporal pattern and sources of Ca(2+) increase induced by I(Na,P) may provide novel targets for antiepileptic drug therapy.",

The present study was an open-label, single-sequence trial in three phases distinguished by differing doses of midazolam. Plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolites, as well as pharmacodynamic parameters, were measured simultaneously after administration of 5, 15 and 30 microg/kg, i.v., midazolam and 15, 50 and 100 microg/kg, p.o., midazolam. 3. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam was significantly correlated with dose after both i.v. and oral administration (both P < 0.001). The AUC(0-6) of midazolam after oral administration was also well correlated with the area under the effect curve for peak saccadic velocity (PSV; P < 0.018), postural sway area (PSA; P < 0.069) and mental sedation as measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS; P < 0.054), but not for critical flicker fusion. 4.

An overexpression of PBR in certain cancers allowed us to consider the use of highly selective ligands to PBR for receptor-mediated drug targeting to tumors. With this in mind, we prepared PBR-targeted nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (PEG-PE micelles) loaded with the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PCL) to test possible synergistic anticancer effects. PEG2k-PE-based polymeric micelles with and without PCL were prepared in HBS, pH 7.5, and conjugated with a PBR-ligand (CB86) in 0.45% of DMSO. The cytotoxic effect of such micelles against the LN 18 human glioblastoma cell line was studied in cell culture. The micelles maintained their size and size distribution and remained intact without drug release after the PBR-ligand conjugation. The PCL-loaded PBR-targeted micelles showed a significantly enhanced toxicity against human glioblastoma LN 18 cancer cells in vitro. Thus, PBR-targeted nanopreparations may potentially serve as a new nanomedicine for targeted cancer therapy.",

Sleep deprivation is considered risky for several pathological diseases such as anxiety and motor and cognitive dysfunctions. Sleep deprivation has recently been reported to cause oxidative damage. This study has been designed to explore the possible involvement of the GABAergic mechanism in protective effects of melatonin against 72-h sleep deprivation-induced behaviour modification and oxidative damage in mice. Mice were sleep-deprived for a period of 72 h using the grid over water suspended method. Animals were divided into groups of 6-8 animals each. Melatonin (5 and 10 mg/kg), flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg), picrotoxin (0.5 mg/kg) and muscimol (0.05 mg/kg) were administered for 5 days starting 2 days before 72-h sleep deprivation. Various behavioural tests (plus maze, zero maze, mirror chamber, actophotometer) and body weight assessment followed by oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde level, glutathione, catalase, nitrite and protein) were carried out. The 72-h sleep deprivation caused significant anxiety-like behaviour, weight loss, impaired locomotor activity and oxidative damage as compared with na\u00efve (without sleep deprivation). Treatment with melatonin (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, ip) significantly improved locomotor activity, weight loss and antianxiety effect as compared with control (sleep-deprived). Biochemically, melatonin treatment significantly restored reduced glutathione, catalase activity, attenuated lipid peroxidation and nitrite level as compared with control animals (72-h sleep-deprived). Flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (0.5 mg/kg) pretreatments with a lower dose of melatonin (5 mg/kg) significantly antagonized the protective effect of melatonin. However, muscimol (0.05 mg/kg) pretreatment with melatonin (5 mg/kg, ip) potentiated the protective effect of melatonin which was significant as compared with their effect per se. This study suggests that GABAergic modulation is involved in the protective action of melatonin against sleep deprivation-induced anxiety-like behaviour and associated oxidative damage.",

The analysis of such studies poses challenges for modeling the impact of complex time-dependent drug exposure, especially given the uncertainty about the way effects cumulate over time and about the etiological relevance of doses taken in different time periods. We present a flexible method for modeling cumulative effects of time-varying exposures, weighted by recency, represented by time-dependent covariates in the Cox proportional hazards model. The function that assigns weights to doses taken in the past is estimated using cubic regression splines.

Scores of PANSS-EC were significantly reduced after 3 days of olanzapine administration. A reduction in NAMA scores was also observed 7 days after administration of olanzapine. The DIEPSS score was unaffected by olanzapine administration. These results suggest that olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets are effective and well-tolerated for treatment excitement in the acute phase of schizophrenic patients. In addition, it is possible that adherence to medications is improved by using olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets.",

Although a clear pathogenesis is yet to be determined, elevated ammonia in the serum and central nervous system are the mainstay for pathogenesis and treatment. Management includes early diagnosis and prompt treatment of precipitating factors (infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte disturbances, hepatocellular carcinoma, dehydration, hypotension, and use of benzodiazepines, psychoactive drugs, and/or alcohol). Clinical trials have established the efficacy of lactulose and lactitol enemas in the treatment of acute hepatic encephalopathy. Extensive clinical experience has demonstrated the efficacy of oral lactulose and lactitol with the goal of two to three soft bowel movements a day for the treatment of chronic HE. However, lactulose and lactitol have significant gastrointestinal side effects. For patients unable to tolerate lactulose or lactitol or who still have persistent chronic HE with lactulose or lactitol, neomycin, metronidazole and rifaximin are second-line agents. More recent data supports the benefits of rifaximin used solely and as an additional agent with fewer side effects than neomycin or metronidazole.

In MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) (MRL-lpr) mice, Bz-423 overcomes deficient expression of the Fas death receptor and hyperactivation of antiapoptotic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling to specifically kill pathogenic CD4(+) T cells. Bz-423 binds to the oligomycin-sensitivity-conferring protein component of the mitochondrial F(0)F(1)-ATPase, which modulates the enzyme leading to formation of superoxide by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Scavenging this reactive oxygen species blocks all subsequent components of the apoptotic cascade. To gain insight into how apoptotic signaling activated by Bz-423-induced superoxide contributes to the selective depletion of MRL-lpr CD4(+) T cells, we characterized the death mechanism in a CD4(+) T cell leukemia line (Jurkat). Although Bz-423-induced superoxide indirectly inactivates Akt, this response is not required for T cell death. Apoptosis instead results from parallel increases in levels of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Noxa and Bak leading to specific activation of Bak, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and a commitment to apoptosis. By directly up-regulating proteins that trigger loss of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity, Bz-423 bypasses defective Fas function and antiapoptotic PI3K-Akt signaling in MRL-lpr CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, because disease-associated abnormalities should sensitize autoreactive CD4(+) T cells to transcriptional up-regulation of Noxa by redox signals and to Bak-dependent apoptosis, the apoptotic mechanism elucidated in Jurkat cells provides important clues into the cell-type- and disease-selective effects of Bz-423 in MRL-lpr mice.", 
    "53": "The primary purpose of this study was to compare changes in cognition in early-onset psychosis after 6-months treatment with quetiapine or olanzapine. This is a randomized, single-blind, 6-month study in 50 adolescents with a diagnosis of early-onset psychosis. Patients were randomized to quetiapine (n = 24) or olanzapine (n =26). A thorough neuropsychological battery was administered at baseline and after 6-month treatment. Out of the total sample included in the study, 32 patients completed at least 6-months treatment with the assigned medication (quetiapine, n =16; olanzapine, n = 16). No changes were observed in cognitive performance after 6-month treatment with quetiapine or olanzapine. Although some trends toward cognitive improvement were observed for the olanzapine group after 6-month treatment, neither group showed statistically significant gains. Furthermore, there was no evidence of any differential efficacy of olanzapine or quetiapine on cognitive improvement in this sample of adolescents with psychosis.", 
    "54": "This study investigated prolactin levels in two groups of children and adolescents receiving risperidone (N=29) or olanzapine (N=13). It focused not only on significant differences but also on effect sizes; took into account dose effects and gender differences; used a longitudinal design (months 1, 3, 6 and 12) that helped control for individual differences; and took into account response differences due to the duration of antipsychotic treatment. Additionally, this study investigated tolerance development using statistical tests, and explored the effect of antipsychotic plasma concentrations at months 1 and 3. After adjusting for gender, treatment duration and individual effects, mean prolactin levels on risperidone were 4.9 ng/mL higher than on olanzapine (10.3 times higher after controlling for dosing potency). On risperidone treatment, the adjusted mean prolactin level at the 3rd month of treatment was significantly higher than at the 1st month; at the 12th month it was significantly lower than at the 1st month; the 1st and 6th months were not significantly different. On olanzapine treatment, adjusted mean prolactin levels at the 3rd and 6th months of treatment were significantly higher than at the 1st month; at the 12th month it was lower than at the 1st month, but the difference was not significant. In males, at the 3rd month, an increase of 1 ng/mL in plasma 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations raised prolactin levels significantly by 0.44 ng/mL. In females, independently of duration (1 or 3 months), an increase of 1 ng/mL in plasma olanzapine concentrations raised prolactin levels significantly by 2.1 ng/mL. After adjusting for dose and the greater potency of risperidone, the increase in prolactin levels during risperidone treatment appeared to be 10.3 times higher than that during olanzapine treatment. Our study showed a pattern consistent with the development of prolactin tolerance over time. Future prolactin studies in children and adolescents taking antipsychotics need to include larger samples with more frequent prolactin measures and long-term plasma concentrations.", 
    "55": "Combined evidence from neuroimaging and neuropathological studies shows that signs of vascular pathology and brain hypoperfusion develop early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the functional implication of these abnormalities, we have studied the cerebrovascular volume and selected markers of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in 11-month-old 3 x Tg-AD mice, using the in situ brain perfusion technique. The cerebrovascular volume of distribution of two vascular space markers, [3H]-inulin and [14C]-sucrose, was significantly lower (-26% and -27%, respectively; p < 0.01) in the brain of 3 x Tg-AD mice compared to non-transgenic littermates. The vascular volume reduction was significant in the hippocampus (p < 0.01), but not in the frontal cortex and cerebellum. However, the brain transport coefficient (Clup) of [14C]-D-glucose (1 microM) and [3H]-diazepam was similar between 3xTg-AD mice and controls, suggesting no difference in the functional integrity of the BBB. We also report a 32% increase (p < 0.001) in the thickness of basement membranes surrounding cortical microvessels along with a 20% increase (p < 0.05) of brain collagen content in 3xTg-AD mice compared to controls. The present data indicate that the cerebrovascular space is reduced in a mouse model of Abeta and tau accumulation, an observation consistent with the presence of cerebrovascular pathology in AD.",

It has inverse agonist efficacy selective for the alpha5 subtype, and this alpha5 inverse agonism is greater than that of the prototypic alpha5-selective compound 3-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-6-[(1-methyl-1,2,3-triazol-4-hdyl)methyloxy]-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazine (alpha5IA). Consistent with its greater alpha5 inverse agonism, MRK-016 increased long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices to a greater extent than alpha5IA. MRK-016 gave good receptor occupancy after oral dosing in rats, with the dose required to produce 50% occupancy being 0.39 mg/kg and a corresponding rat plasma EC(50) value of 15 ng/ml that was similar to the rhesus monkey plasma EC(50) value of 21 ng/ml obtained using [(11)C]flumazenil positron emission tomography. In normal rats, MRK-016 enhanced cognitive performance in the delayed matching-to-position version of the Morris water maze but was not anxiogenic, and in mice it was not proconvulsant and did not produce kindling. MRK-016 had a short half-life in rat, dog, and rhesus monkey (0.3-0.5 h) but had a much lower rate of turnover in human compared with rat, dog, or rhesus monkey hepatocytes. Accordingly, in human, MRK-016 had a longer half-life than in preclinical species ( approximately 3.5 h). Although it was well tolerated in young males, with a maximal tolerated single dose of 5 mg corresponding to an estimated occupancy in the region of 75%, MRK-016 was poorly tolerated in elderly subjects, even at a dose of 0.5 mg, which, along with its variable human pharmacokinetics, precluded its further development.", 
    "57": "Native GABA(A) channels display a single-channel conductance ranging between approximately 10 and 90 pS. Diazepam increases the conductance of some of these native channels but never those of recombinant receptors, unless they are coexpressed with GABARAP. This trafficking protein clusters recombinant receptors in the membrane, suggesting that high-conductance channels arise from receptors that are at locally high concentrations. The amphipathic (MA) helix that is present in the large cytoplasmic loop of every subunit of all ligand-gated ion channels mediates protein-protein interactions. Here we report that when applied to inside-out patches, a peptide mimicking the MA helix of the gamma2 subunit (gamma(381-403)) of the GABA(A) receptor abrogates the potentiating effect of diazepam on both endogenous receptors and recombinant GABA(A) receptors coexpressed with GABARAP, by substantially reducing their conductance. The protein interaction disrupted by the peptide did not involve GABARAP, because a shorter peptide (gamma(386-403)) known to compete with the gamma2-GABARAP interaction did not affect the conductance of recombinant alphabetagamma receptors coexpressed with GABARAP. The requirement for receptor clustering and the fact that the gamma2 MA helix is able to self-associate support a mechanism whereby adjacent GABA(A) receptors interact via their gamma2-subunit MA helices, altering ion permeation through each channel. Alteration of ion-channel function arising from dynamic interactions between ion channels of the same family has not been reported previously and highlights a novel way in which inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain may be differentially modulated.",

Ongoing efforts to develop guidelines to enhance the safety of these pediatric sedative encounters have resulted in great strides in the prevention of adverse events. In addition, the Society for Pediatric Sedation, associated with the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium, provides an important forum for practitioner education and the promotion of safe care for infants and children undergoing sedative experiences. Care of the subset of patients with congenital heart disease or pulmonary hypertension remains especially demanding.

However, in extreme cases, adequate treatment requires mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation to correct the acid-base imbalance created by the disease process. We present a case of a 52-year-old female with COPD exacerbation requiring intubation who failed extubation multiple times while concurrently being treated with lorazepam, for agitation. Based on the evidence for increased carbon dioxide retention associated with benzodiazepine use, we weaned the patient off the lorazepam which in turn allowed the patient to be successfully weaned off the ventilator.",

A standard anxiolytic, diazepam (3 mg/kg, p.o.), was used as a positive control. In a similar way, diazepam increased the percentage of entries and time spent in the open arms when compared with vehicle (% open entries: vehicle, 45.4 +/- 1.3; diazepam, 50.7 +/- 1.9; % time spent in open arms: vehicle, 28.2 +/- 0.9; diazepam, 38.9 +/- 1.2). Regarding ethological measures, CRD at the highest dose (800 mg/kg) reduced peeping out (anxiety-related behaviour) (vehicle, 3.1 +/- 0.6; CRD, 0.9 +/- 0.2) and increased end-arm activity (vehicle, 0.2 +/- 0.2; CRD, 2.0 +/- 0.4), indicating an enhanced tendency of the rats to explore actively the potentially dangerous areas of the maze.

    "64": "Compared to C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice exhibit greater 'anxiousness' on behavioural tests of anxiety, and can show significantly longer sleep disruptions after exposure to anxiogenic situations. Relative to C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice also have reduced benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor densities in the brain and fivefold less BZ receptor density in the amygdala, a region important in anxiety and in the control of arousal. Lorazepam is a BZ receptor full agonist and has been used to treat both anxiety and insomnia. Differences between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice raise the question of whether BZ agonists would impact sleep and activity differentially in the two strains. We examined the effects of two doses of lorazepam (0.5 and 1.5 mg kg(-1)) or saline alone (0.2 mL) on sleep and activity in C57BL/6 (n = 8) and BALB/c (n = 7) mice. Compared to saline, both doses of lorazepam significantly increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and reduced activity in both strains. In C57BL/6 mice, rapid eye movement (REM) was increased at both doses. In BALB/c mice, the 0.5 mg kg(-1) dose had no significant influence on REM, whereas REM was reduced significantly after the 1.5 mg kg(-1) dose. The results demonstrate significant differences between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice in the effects of lorazepam on REM, whereas the effects on NREM and activity were similar. Strain differences in the number of BZ receptors in the amygdala, but not other brain regions, suggests possible site specificity in the effects of lorazepam on REM. These differences in BZ-binding sites in the amygdala could be a significant factor in differences in the sleep response between C57 and BALB/c mice.", 
    "65": "To elucidate the differences in the cyclosporine A (CyA) PK between cadaveric and living-related renal transplantation (CRT and LRT, respectively) recipients, a retrospective cohort study of clinical PK was conducted. Data from 80 patients who received LRT (n=75) and CRT (n=5) over 4 years were included. The incidence of acute rejection in CRT recipients was over 5 times higher than that in LRT recipients. On day 14 after transplantation, the area under the blood concentration versus time curve (AUC) per dose up to 4 h in CRT recipients was 65.3 % that of LRT recipients, however, there was no difference in the blood trough levels. Unlike LRT, renal failure derived from long ischemia time was observed in CRT recipients, and it is speculated that renal failure affects the PK of CyA. Moreover, we performed intravenous. (i.v.) and intraduodenal (i.d.) PK studies of CyA using renal failure model rats prepared by renal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR rats). There were no differences in PK profiles after i.v. administration of CyA between RIR and control rats; however, AUC up to infinity (1.81+/-0.18 microg.h/ml) in RIR rats after i.d. administration was significantly lower than in control rats (5.01+/-1.78 microg.h/ml). In addition, the absorption of CyA and midazolam, an ideal probe for CYP3A, from the intestinal loop in RIR rats was significantly less (69.8% and 42.8 %, respectively) than in control rats. These results suggest that the contribution of intestinal metabolism by CYP3A to decreasing CyA absorption in RIR rats is significant, namely, there is a possibility that the reason for poor absorption of CyA in CRT recipients is increasing intestinal CYP3A activity is maybe renal injury derived from long renal ischemia. The results of this study provide a useful information for therapeutic drug monitoring of CyA in CRT recipients.",

Human P450 3A5 is recognized as the secondly most important enzymes among P450 3A subfamily, with some differences in substrate specificity, catalytic activity, and region-selectivity of P450 3A4. Because addition of histidine-tag to microsomal P450s is universally used for recombinant protein purifications, purified P450 3A4 protein is commercially available, but P450 3A5 is not at present. In the present study, although catalytic activity of purified P450 3A5 expressed using the original plasmid from bacterial membranes was observed in reconstitution systems containing NADPH-P450 reductase, cytochrome b(5), and phospholipids, a histidine-tagged P450 3A5 protein did not show any detectable midazolam hydroxylation activities in the same reconstitution systems. From the docking simulation of midazolam into a P450 3A5 homology model based on the published P450 3A4 structure, it was supported that midazolam could not easily access to the center of the heme of histidine-tagged P450 3A5, with the high interaction energy compared with the original P450 3A5. In conclusion, these results suggest that the histidine-tagged system would be non-applicable for P450 3A5 function.", 
    "67": "Clonidine is classified as an imidazoline and it is the prototypical alpha-2 receptor agonists. It has been used for several years to treat hypertension. It has also been used, \"off label\", for a variety of purposes, including opioid and anesthetic sparing effects, anxiolysis and sedation, drug withdrawal as well as stabilizing blood pressure and reducing stress response to surgery. Particularly in the case of patients with overt or underlying cardiac disease and in those at risk of perioperative ischemia the action of clonidine can be expected to reduce the risk of procedure-related cardiac events. In addition, clonidine used as a premedication drug before surgery or surgical procedure, has been shown to substantially reduce anaesthetic, benzodiazepine and opioids requirements. However, its \"off label\" use, the absence of an intravenous form of in the United States, possible inadvertent hypotension, bradycardia or post-operative sedation, and the variability of the haemodynamic response to different doses or rates of administration, have limited its use in clinical practice.

    "68": "Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist currently utilized for continuous infusion for sedation/analgesia in the intensive care unit (ICU). Dexmedetomidine offers remarkable pharmacological properties including sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia with the unique characteristic to cause no respiratory depression. In addition it posses sympatholytic and antinociceptive effects that allow hemodynamic stability during surgical stimulation. Different from most of clinically used anesthetics, dexmedetomidine brings about not only a sedative-hypnotic effect via an action on a single type of receptors, but also an analgesic effect and an autonomic blockade that is beneficial in cardiac risk situations. Several studies have demonstrated its safety, although bradycardia and hypotension are the most predictable and frequent side effects. Dexmedetomidine has shown to consistently reduce opioids, propofol, and benzodiazepines requirements. In the last years it has emerged as an affective therapeutic drug in a wide range of anesthetic management, promising large benefits in the perioperative use. In particular this review focuses on dexmedetomidine utilization in premedication, general surgery, neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, bariatric surgery, and for procedural sedation and awake fiberoptic intubation. In all these fields dexmedetomidine has demonstrated to be an efficacious and safe adjuvant to other sedative and anesthetic medications.",

Furthermore, the value of measuring endogenous levels of cortisol over a 24 h period (AUC(F)) needs to be confirmed.

On d 5 of the study, the last dose of either clarithromycin or placebo was supplemented with an oral dose of 7.5 mg midazolam (MDZ); blood and urine samples were then collected at various times. All samples collected at the same sampling times on d 4 were used to evaluate the effects of MDZ administration on cortisol levels and metabolism. The ratio of 1-hydroxymidazolam (1-OHMDZ) concentration to MDZ concentration at 1 h (MR) was taken as a measure of the in vivo CYP3A activity.

    "79": "Prior experience with the elevated plus maze (EPM) increases the avoidance of rodents to the open arms and impairs the anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines on the traditional behaviors evaluated upon re-exposure to the maze, a phenomenon known as one-trial tolerance. Risk assessment behaviors are also sensitive to benzodiazepines. During re-exposure to the maze, these behaviors reinstate the information-processing initiated during the first experience, and the detection of danger generates stronger open-arm avoidance. The present study investigated whether the benzodiazepine midazolam alters risk assessment behaviors and Fos protein distribution associated with test and retest sessions in the EPM. Naive or maze-experienced Wistar rats received either saline or midazolam (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and were subjected to the EPM. Midazolam caused the usual effects on exploratory behavior, increasing exploratory activity of naive rats in the open arms and producing no effects on these conventional measures in rats re-exposed to the maze. Risk assessment behaviors, however, were sensitive to the benzodiazepine during both sessions, indicating anxiolytic-like effects of the drug in both conditions. Fos immunohistochemistry showed that midazolam injections were associated with a distinct pattern of action when administered before the test or retest session, and the anterior cingulate cortex, area 1 (Cg1), was the only structure targeted by the benzodiazepine in both situations. Bilateral infusions of midazolam into the Cg1 replicated the behavioral effects of the drug injected systemically, suggesting that this area is critically involved in the anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines, although the behavioral strategy adopted by the animals appears to depend on the previous knowledge of the threatening environment.",

    "84": "Controversy exists regarding the site where anesthetics act in the brain to produce sedation and unconsciousness. Actions in the cerebral cortex and thalamus are likely, although the relative importance of each site is unclear. We used in computo modeling to investigate the sensitivity of cortical and thalamic neurons to midazolam (MDZ) at concentrations that produce unconsciousness. The GABA(A) receptor conductance of the model was manipulated to simulate the effects of MDZ at free-drug plasma concentrations ranging from 8 nM to 100 nM; sleepiness to complete unconsciousness occurs in humans in the 10-40 nM range. Prolongation of phasic inhibition was simulated by increasing the decay time constant and tonic inhibition was simulated by introducing a tonic current; the extent of phasic and tonic inhibition was appropriate for each simulated MDZ concentration. Phasic and tonic inhibition was simulated in cortex, and phasic inhibition was simulated in thalamus. Simulation of MDZ effect decreased cortical neuronal firing rate. For example, the mean cortical neuronal firing rate decreased by 15% (P<0.01) and 26% (P<0.01) at MDZ concentrations of 10 nM and 40 nM, respectively. However, thalamic firing rate did not change. In computo modeling of the thalamocortical system indicates that MDZ-induced GABAergic inhibition of cortical neurons plays a significant role in the transition from waking to unconsciousness. Although MDZ produces phasic inhibition in the thalamus, computer simulation suggests it is not significant enough to decrease thalamic neuronal firing. Thus, based on in computo modeling, MDZ at sedative/hypnotic concentrations produces its effects by decreasing cortical neuronal firing.",

    "89": "LC coupled to single (LC-MS) and tandem (LC-MS/MS) mass spectrometry is recognized as the most powerful analytical tools for metabolic studies in drug discovery. In this article, we describe five cases illustrating the utility of screening xenobiotic metabolites in routine analysis of forensic samples using LC-MS/MS. Analyses were performed using a previously published LC-MS/MS general unknown screening (GUS) procedure developed using a hybrid linear IT-tandem mass spectrometer. In each of the cases presented, the presence of metabolites of xenobiotics was suspected after analyzing urine samples. In two cases, the parent drug was also detected and the metabolites were merely useful to confirm drug intake, but in three other cases, metabolite detection was of actual forensic interest. The presented results indicate that: (i) the GUS procedure developed is useful to detect a large variety of drug metabolites, which would have been hardly detected using targeted methods in the context of clinical or forensic toxicology; (ii) metabolite structure can generally be inferred from their \"enhanced\" product ion scan spectra; and (iii) structure confirmation can be achieved through in vitro metabolic experiments or through the analysis of urine samples from individuals taking the parent drug.", 
    "90": "ESRD can affect the pharmacokinetic disposition of drugs subject to nonrenal clearance. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A, and multiple intestinal and hepatic drug transporters are thought to mediate this process, but the extent to which kidney disease alters the function of these proteins in humans is unknown. We used midazolam and fexofenadine to assess CYP3A (intestinal and hepatic) and drug transport, respectively, in patients with ESRD and healthy control subjects. We evaluated the effect of uremia on CYP3A and transporter expression in vitro by incubating normal rat hepatocytes and enterocytes with serum drawn from study participants. ESRD dramatically reduced nonrenal transporter function, evidenced by a 63% decrease in clearance (P < 0.001) and a 2.8-fold increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve for fexofenadine (P = 0.002), compared with control subjects. We did not observe significant differences in midazolam or 1'-hydroxymidazolam clearance or area under the curve after oral administration, suggesting that CYP3A function is not changed by ESRD. Changes in hepatocyte and enterocyte protein expression in the presence of uremic serum were consistent with in vivo results. These findings demonstrate a mechanism for altered drug disposition in kidney disease, which may partially account for the high rates of drug toxicity in this population.", 
    "91": "The widely used term \"overdose\" denotes a toxic effect: opioid-induced intoxication and a mechanism: the poisoning results only from an overdose. Surprisingly, our understanding of the pathophysiology of this deadly complication is limited. In drug users, we attempted to: (1) improve knowledge of drug-induced respiratory effects; (2) clarify the mechanisms of drug interactions; (3) identify factors of variability and vulnerability. A prospective study of opioid overdoses confirmed that poisonings involving buprenorphine do exist. However, the mechanisms of buprenorphine poisoning are more complex than only an overdose, particularly the severity is less than that induced by heroin. In contrast, methadone overdose is life-threatening. Experimental studies addressed several clinical questions and also showed limited discrepancies. At pharmacological doses, opioids decrease the ventilatory response to CO(2). However, this effect does not account for the morbimortality of opioid poisonings. The mechanisms of opioid-induced morbimortality are different. Buprenorphine at doses near its median lethal dose did not induce acute respiratory failure as defined by a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO(2)). In contrast, the combination of buprenorphine with flunitrazepam results in a decrease in PaO(2). This harmful interaction does not exist with other benzodiazepines in the rat, except for very high doses of nordazepam. The interaction results from a pharmacokinetic process. In contrast, methadone causes a dose-dependent decrease in PaO(2,) even significant before hypercapnia. We are assessing the relationships between on one hand alterations of ventilatory pattern and of arterial blood gas and on the other hand the different types of opiate receptors in the rats.", 
    "92": "Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) serve as a model for synaptic physiology. The molecular sequences of the postsynaptic glutamate receptors have been described; however, the pharmacological profile has not been fully elucidated. The postsynaptic molecular sequence suggests a novel glutamate receptor subtype. Kainate does not depolarize the muscle, but dampens evoked EPSP amplitudes. Quantal responses show a decreased amplitude and area under the voltage curve indicative of reduced postsynaptic receptor sensitivity to glutamate transmission. ATPA, a kainate receptor agonist, did not mimic kainate's action. The metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist t-ACPD had no effect. Domoic acid, a kainate/AMPA receptor agonist, blocks the postsynaptic receptors without depolarizing the muscle. However, SYM 2081, a kainate receptor agonist, did depolarize the muscle and reduce the EPSP amplitude at 1 mM but not at 0.1 mM. This supports the notion that these are generally a quisqualate subtype receptors with some oddities in the pharmacological profile. The results suggest a direct postsynaptic action of kainate due to partial antagonist action on the quisqualate receptors. There does not appear to be presynaptic auto-regulation via a kainate receptor subtype or a metabotropic auto-receptor. This study aids in furthering the pharmokinetic profiling and specificity of the receptor subtypes.", 
    "93": "Ethanol modulates the actions of multiple neurotransmitter systems, including GABA. However, its enhancing effects on GABA signaling typically are seen only at high concentrations. In contrast, although GABA is a prominent neurotransmitter in the circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), we see ethanol modulation of clock phase resetting at low concentrations (<50 mM). A possible explanation is that ethanol enhances GABAergic signaling in the SCN through activating GABA(A) receptors that contain the delta subunit (GABA(Adelta) receptors), which are sensitive to low ethanol concentrations. Therefore, we investigated whether ethanol acts on GABA(Adelta) receptors in the SCN. Here we show that acute application of the GABA(Adelta) receptor antagonist, RO15-4513, to mouse hypothalamic slices containing the SCN prevents ethanol inhibition of nighttime glutamate-induced (photic-like) phase delays of the circadian clock. Diazepam, which enhances activity of GABA(A) receptors containing the gamma subunit (GABA(Agamma) receptors), does not modulate these phase shifts. Moreover, we find that RO15-4513 prevents ethanol enhancement of daytime serotonergic (non-photic) phase advances of the circadian clock. Furthermore, diazepam phase-advances the SCN circadian clock when applied alone in the daytime, while ethanol has no effect by itself at that time. These data support the hypothesis that ethanol acts on GABA(Adelta) receptors in the SCN to modulate photic and non-photic circadian clock phase resetting. They also reveal distinct modulatory roles of different GABA(A) receptor subtypes in circadian clock phase regulation.",

    "102": "Behind the multiple arguments for and against the use of premedication, sedative drugs in children is a noble principle that of minimizing psychological trauma related to anesthesia and surgery. However, several confounding factors make it very difficult to reach didactic evidence-based conclusions. One of the key confounding issues is that the nature of expectations and responses for both parent and child vary greatly in different environments around the world. Studies applicable to one culture and to one hospital system (albeit multicultural) may not apply elsewhere. Moreover, the study of hospital-related distress begins at the start of the patient's journey and ends long after hospital discharge; it cannot be focused completely on just the moment of anesthetic induction. Taking an example from actual practice experience, the trauma caused by the actual giving of a premedication to a child who absolutely does not want it and may struggle may not be recorded in a study but could form a significant component of overall effect and later psychological pathology. Clearly, attitudes by health professionals and parents to the practice of routine pediatric premedication, vary considerably, often provoking strong opinions. In this pro-con article we highlight two very different approaches to premedication. It is hoped that this helps the reader to critically re-evaluate a practice, which was universal historically and now in many centers is more selective.", 
    "103": "Anxiety disorders, caused by continuous or acute stress or fear, have been highly prevailing psychiatric disorders. For the acute treatment of the disorders, benzodiazepines have been widely used despite having liabilities that limit their utility. Alternatively, endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ and nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor (or opioid-receptor-like-1 receptor) have important roles in the integration of emotional components, e.g. anxiolytic activity is the key behavioral action of nociceptin/orphanin FQ in brain. In our preceding study, various structurally novel 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazole derivatives were designed and synthesized as highly potent nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor selective full agonists in vitro with high or moderate nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor occupancy in the mice brain per os based on appropriate physicochemical properties for the oral brain activity [Hayashi et al.

In the present study, drug design and structure-activity relationships for Vogel anticonflict activities in mice per os, metabolic stabilities in human liver microsome, CYP2D6 inhibitions, serum protein bindings, and human ether-a-go-go related gene binding affinities of novel nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor agonists were investigated. Through the series of coherent drug discovery studies, the strongest nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor agonist, 1-[1-(1-methylcyclooctyl)-4-piperidinyl]-2-[(3R)-3-piperidinyl]-1H-benzimidazole was designed and identified as a new-class orally potent anxiolytic with little side-effects, as significant findings.", 
    "104": "Control of seizure activity is critical to survival and neuroprotection following nerve agent exposure. Extensive research has shown that three classes of drugs, muscarinic antagonists, benzodiazepines, and N-methyl-D: -aspartate antagonists, are capable of moderating these seizures. This study began to map the neural areas in rat brain that respond to these three drug classes resulting in anticonvulsant effects. Drugs of each class (scopolamine, midazolam, MK-801) were evaluated for their ability to prevent sarin-induced seizures when injected into specific brain areas (lateral ventricle, anterior piriform cortex, basolateral amygdala, area tempestas). Animals were pretreated by microinjection with saline or a dose of drug from one of the three classes 30 min prior to receiving 150 microg/kg sarin, subcutaneously, followed by 2.0 mg/kg atropine methylnitrate, intramuscularly. Animals were then returned to their cages, where electroencephalographic activity was monitored for seizures. Anticonvulsant effective doses (ED(50)) were determined using an up-down dosing procedure over successive animals. Scopolamine provided anticonvulsant effects in each area tested, while midazolam was effective in each area except the lateral ventricle. MK-801 was only effective at preventing seizures when injected into the basolateral amygdala or area tempestas. The results show a unique neuroanatomical and pharmacological specificity for control of nerve agent-induced seizures.", 
    "105": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seasonal variation in serum melatonin levels and their relationship to the changes in the serum progesterone level, ovarian steroidogenesis, and embryonic development during two successive pregnancies of Cynopterus sphinx. Circulating melatonin concentrations showed two peaks; one coincided with the period of low progesterone synthesis and delayed embryonic development, whereas the second peak coincided with regressing corpus luteum. This finding suggests that increased serum melatonin level during November-December may be responsible for delayed embryonic development by suppressing progesterone synthesis. The study showed increased melatonin receptors (MTNR1A and MTNR1B) in the corpus luteum and in the utero-embryonic unit during the period of delayed embryonic development. The in vitro study showed that a high dose of melatonin suppressed progesterone synthesis, whereas a lower dose of melatonin increased progesterone synthesis by the ovary. The effects of melatonin on ovarian steroidogenesis are mediated through changes in the expression of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme, and LH receptor proteins. This study further showed a suppressive impact of melatonin on the progesterone receptor (PGR) in the utero-embryonic unit; this effect might contribute to delayed embryonic development in C. sphinx. The results of the present study thus suggest that a high circulating melatonin level has a dual contribution in retarding embryonic development in C. sphinx by impairing progesterone synthesis as well as by inhibiting progesterone action by reducing expression of PGR in the utero-embryonic unit.",

Its first description in humans dates back to 1985, and its first description in narcoleptic patients to 1992. Although the precise pathophysiology of RBD remains unclear, it is likely, in the case of RBD associated with narcolepsy, that the altered function of hypocretin pathways projecting from the lateral hypothalamus to the ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal grey matter and the lateral pontine tegmentum has a consistent role. The percentage of narcoleptic patients complaining of clinical RBD lies somewhere between 10 and 15% of the narcoleptic population. The age of onset is younger than in the other forms of chronic RBD. Clinical features are the same as in the other forms of chronic RBD, but the frequency of the episodes is less marked. Associated features include other parasomnias, periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMs) and olfactory dysfunction. Polysomnographic tracings are remarkable for elevated submental electromyographic (EMG) tone and/or excessive phasic submental EMG twitching. Data on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association and on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin/orexin levels are limited. Clinical variants include RBD induced or worsened by pharmacological agents, most of them being used to treat cataplexy, RBD in narcoleptic children and RBD in the context of symptomatic narcolepsy. Several treatments of RBD are available including clonazepam, melatonin and more recently pramipexole. However, in the absence of any pharmacological trials of these drugs on RBD in narcoleptic patients, it is difficult to provide guidance other than to recommend conventional treatments of RBD.", 
    "112": "The translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), was originally identified as an alternate binding site for the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) ligand, diazepam, in the periphery, but has now been distinguished as a novel site. The TSPO is ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues but only minimally in the healthy brain and increased levels of TSPO expression have been noted in neuroinflammatory conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. This increase in TSPO expression has been reported to coincide with the process of microglial activation, whereby the brain's intrinsic immune system becomes active. Therefore, by using recently developed high affinity, selective TSPO ligands in conjunction with functional imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), it becomes possible to study the process of microglial activation in the living brain. A number of high affinity ligands, the majority of which are C,N-substituted acetamide derivatives, have been successfully radiolabelled and used in in vivo studies of the TSPO and the process of microglial activation. This review highlights recent achievements (up to December 2008) in the field of functional imaging of the TSPO as well as the radiosyntheses involved in such studies.",

In particular, considerable attention is devoted to the CYP2D subfamily, which is a group of highly polymorphic enzymes. First, the metabolic profiles of diazepam of humans and other animals are compared. In this review, the authors describe a novel genetic polymorphism of diazepam observed in commonly used rat strains and compare it to human genetic polymorphisms. The genetic basis underlying diazepam polymorphism in rats is also discussed. The authors conclude that the metabolic capacities and major metabolic pathways of diazepam are quite different among rat strains and in the Wistar strain due to CYP2D3 genetic polymorphism, which is independent of the debrisoquine polymorphism catalyzed by CYP2D2. The situation, in which major metabolites differ depending on animal strain, will be highly problematic not only in pharmacokinetic studies of test compounds, but also in pharmacological or toxicological tests. This may provide researchers who use experimental animals insights into important aspects of the genetic background of experimental animals.

The combination doses were 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 times the 50% effective dose (ED50) of each agent in each test. The interaction of midazolam and epibatidine was investigated by isobolographic analysis. Behavioral side effects were also investigated.",

    "146": "We investigated 64 consecutive patients undergoing gynecological laparotomy under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. Midazolam (5 mg) was administered intramuscularly at 15 min before arrival at the operating room. The anesthesiologist informed the patient of the operating room number after evaluating her using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scale. A BIS probe was then attached to the patient's forehead while she was in the lateral position for epidural puncture. Another anesthesiologist interviewed the patient on the day after surgery and asked her the operating room number and whether there was recall of pain. Group A comprised patients with no recall of the room number and no recall of pain during epidural puncture and group R comprised patients who remembered both the room number and the pain. Patients recalling only the room number or the pain were excluded.", 
    "147": "Forty patients were classified as group A and 20 as group R. Four patients remembered only the room number and they were excluded. There were significant differences in body weight, OAA/S scale on arrival at the operating room, and average BIS, and electromyogram (EMG) values during epidural puncture between the two groups. These four parameters were entered into a multiple logistic regression model for multivariate analysis. The analysis identified the BIS value as the only independent predictor of complete amnesia during epidural puncture.",

    "150": "A role for the cyclic AMP systems in the development of morphine dependence has been previously reported. In this study we investigated whether morphine dependence was inhibited by phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors rolipram and diazepam. Dependence on morphine was induced by a 7-day s.c. implantation of morphine pellets. On day 8, morphine withdrawal was precipitated by an injection of naloxone. In order to determine the effect of rolipram and diazepam rats were injected with these drugs once daily for seven days as well as 30 min before of naloxone injection. When opioid withdrawal was precipitated, an enhanced noradrenaline turnover and increased level of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were observed 30 min after naloxone administration. Moreover, c-Fos expression was induced in the PVN after naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Co-administration of rolipram or diazepam with morphine during the pre-treatment period, significantly reduced the signs of withdrawal, the enhancement of noradrenaline turnover and the increase in cyclic AMP. However, these inhibitors did not modify either levels of cyclic GMP or c-Fos expression in the PVN. These findings demonstrate that co-administration of rolipram or diazepam with morphine attenuate the withdrawal syndrome and suggest that these compounds may prevent the up-regulation of the cyclic AMP pathway and the associated increase in cyclic AMP level in morphine-withdrawn rats.", 
    "151": "Drugs that act as allosteric activators at the benzodiazepine site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor complex are used commonly to treat insomnia but relatively little is known of how such use affects learning and memory. Although anterograde effects on memory acquisition have been shown, possible retrograde effects on consolidation are more relevant when such agents are administered at bedtime. We tested the effects of two GABA(A) allosteric activators on sleep-dependent motor skill memory consolidation in 12 healthy male subjects. Subjects slept in a sleep laboratory for four consecutive nights (one accommodation night followed by three experimental nights). Placebo, triazolam 0.375 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg were given to each subject in counterbalanced order on the experimental nights. Polysomnographic (PSG) sleep measurement and sleep-dependent motor learning were assessed at each condition. Triazolam was associated with longer total sleep time and increased Stage 2 sleep. Both zolpidem and triazolam were associated with increased latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Overnight motor learning correlated with total sleep time in the placebo condition but not in the triazolam or zolpidem conditions. A statistically significant impairment in motor performance occurred overnight in the triazolam condition only. Triazolam, given in sufficient doses to prolong sleep in healthy people, affected overnight motor learning adversely. Zolpidem, in a dose sufficient to prolong REM onset latency but without other effects on PSG-measured sleep, degraded the relationship between total sleep time and overnight motor learning. These data indicate that non-selective or alpha1-preferring benzodiazepine site allosteric activators can interfere with sleep-dependent memory consolidation.",

With late administration, GYKI 52466 also rapidly terminated seizures and they seldom recurred, whereas diazepam was slow to produce seizure control and recurrences were common. Although both treatments caused sedation, GYKI 52466-treated animals retained neurological responsiveness whereas diazepam-treated animals did not. GYKI 52466 did not affect blood pressure whereas diazepam caused a sustained drop in mean arterial pressure.",

Plasma concentrations of diazepam were quantified using a validated LC/MS-MS assay, and were analysed by both a non-compartmental approach and by compartmental modelling.", 
    "167": "The maximum concentration (C(max)) of diazepam after avizafone injection was higher than that obtained after injection of diazepam itself (231 vs. 148 ng.mL(-1)), while area under the curve (AUC) values were equal. Diazepam concentrations reached their maximal value faster after injection of avizafone. Injection of avizafone with atropine-pralidoxime (AIBC) had no effect on diazepam C(max) and AUC, but the time to C(max) was increased, relative to avizafone injected alone. According to the Akaike criterion, the pharmacokinetics of diazepam after injection as a prodrug was best described as a two-compartment with zero-order absorption model. When atropine and pralidoxime were injected with avizafone, the best pharmacokinetic model was a two-compartment with a first-order absorption model.",

    "173": "Glutamate is believed to be the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate retina, and its fast postsynaptic effects are elicited by activating NMDA-, kainate-, or AMPA-type glutamate receptors. We have characterized the ionotropic glutamate receptors present on retinal horizontal cells of the skate, which possess a unique all-rod retina simplifying synaptic circuitry within the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Isolated external horizontal cells were examined using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. Glutamate and its analogues kainate and AMPA, but not NMDA, elicited dose-dependent currents. The AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 at 100 microm abolished glutamate-elicited currents. Desensitization of glutamate currents was removed upon coapplication of cyclothiazide, known to potentiate AMPA receptor responses, but not by concanavalin A, which potentiates kainate receptor responses. The dose-response curve to glutamate was significantly broader in the presence of the desensitization inhibitor cyclothiazide. Polyclonal antibodies directed against AMPA receptor subunits revealed prominent labeling of isolated external horizontal cells with the GluR2/3 and GluR4 antibodies. 1-Naphthylacetyl spermine, known to block calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, significantly reduced glutamate-gated currents of horizontal cells. Downregulation of glutamate responses was induced by increasing extracellular ion concentrations of Zn2+ and H+. The present study suggests that Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors likely play an important role in shaping the synaptic responses of skate horizontal cells and that alterations in extracellular concentrations of calcium, zinc, and hydrogen ions have the potential to regulate the strength of postsynaptic signals mediated by AMPA receptors within the OPL.", 
    "174": "Antipsychotics are widely used in psychiatry, and consequently a lot of their side effects have been reported. One of them is cardiovascular disease leading to increased risk of stroke, thrombosis, pulmonary, embolism, in which hyperactivation of blood platelets is involved. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of the second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, and a typical neuroleptic - haloperidol - on the one step of platelet activation-platelet aggregation induced by collagen in vitro. Blood was collected into buffered sodium citrate (3.8%) and centrifuged to get platelet-rich plasma (PRP). In PRP (2x10(8) platelets/ml) obtained from healthy volunteers that was incubated with antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol; 30 min) aggregation of blood platelets was measured using a Chrono-Log Lumi-aggregometer. Aggregation of platelets was measured after stimulation of platelets with 1 microl of collagen (2 microg/ml).", 
    "175": "Clozapine, like haloperidol reduced platelet aggregation induced by collagen (inhibition of platelet aggregation reached about 20%) (P=1x10(-5) and P=0.003, respectively). Risperidone had also a weak antiaggregatory effect (P=0.05). Among tested antipsychotics only olanzapine had no effect on collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation (P>0.05).", 
    "176": "The obtained results indicate that the difference in action of tested drugs on platelet aggregation may dependent on the various chemical structures of these drugs. Clozapine, risperidone and haloperidol are structurally diverse, and they all significantly reduce platelet aggregability induced by collagen. On the other hand, a close structural analog of clozapine - olanzapine - did not inhibit platelet aggregation. However, mechanism of antipsychotics action on blood platelets is not clear. Moreover, it seems that clozapine, risperidone and haloperidol treatment due to antiaggregatory action may have even some antithrombotic effects.", 
    "177": "The regional neuronal changes taking place in the early and late stages of antipsychotic treatment are still not well characterized in humans. In addition, it is not known whether these regional changes are predictive of or are correlated with treatment response. Using PET with 15O, we evaluated the time course of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns generated by a first (haloperidol) and a second (olanzapine) generation antipsychotic drug in patients with schizophrenia during a 6-week treatment trial. Patients were initially scanned after withdrawal of all psychotropic medication (2 weeks), and then blindly randomized to treatment with haloperidol (n=12) or olanzapine (n=17) for a period of 6 weeks. Patients were scanned again after 1 and 6 weeks of treatment. All assessments, including scanning sessions, were obtained in a double-blind manner. As hypothesized, we observed rCBF changes that were common to both the drugs, implicating cortico-subcortical and limbic neuronal networks in antipsychotic action. In addition, in these regions, some patterns seen at weeks 1 and 6 were distinctive, indexing neuronal changes related to an early (ventral striatum, hippocampus) and consolidated (anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortex) stage of drug response. Finally, both after 1 and 6 weeks of treatment, we observed differential patterns of rCBF activation between good and poor responders. After 1 week of treatment, greater rCBF increase in the ventral striatum and greater decrease in the hippocampus were associated with good response.",

A second injection, which was the opposite drug to the first injection was administered as needed. Only when excitement obviously increased following the first injection, which was considered uncontrollable without thiopental according to expert experience, was thiopental given as a second injection. A total of 137 patients were included. The mean age was 40.4 years (SD 13.1), and the rate of male gender, drug-na\u00efve, and F2 (schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders) on the ICD-10 were 48.9%, 29.9%, and 65.7%, respectively.",

The 38-year-old male patient was admitted for a series of complex partial seizures with secondary generalization leading to refractory CSE. During the transport to the hospital the patient was given 22.5 mg diazepam, 12.5 mg etomidate, and 5 mg midazolam without success. An additional dose of 4 mg lorazepam and a dose of 1,500 mg levetiracetam after admission were yet without clinical effect. A further treatment with lacosamide (300 mg via percutaneous gastric fistula) resulted in complete clinical remission of the epileptic activity within 30 min. The application of lacosamide resulted in cessation of CSE and was well tolerated. To our knowledge, this is the first case of successful treatment of refractory CSE with lacosamide. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lacosamide in treatment of SE.", 
    "183": "The fortuitous discovery of the benzodiazepines and the subsequent application of these agents to the treatment of status epilepticus (SE) heralds in the modern age of treating this neurologic emergency. More than 50 years after their discovery, the benzodiazepines remain the drugs of first choice in the treatment of SE. However, the benzodiazepines can be ineffective, especially in those patients whose seizures are the most prolonged. The benzodiazepines act by increasing the affinity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABAA receptors. A receptor's subunit composition affects its functional and pharmacologic properties, trafficking, and cellular localization. The GABAA receptors that mediate synaptic inhibition typically contain a gamma2 subunit and are diazepam-sensitive. Among the GABAA receptors that mediate tonic inhibition are the benzodiazepine-insensitive delta subunit-containing receptors. The initial studies investigating the pathogenesis of SE demonstrated that a reduction in GABA-mediated inhibition within the hippocampus was important in maintenance of SE, and this reduction correlated with a rapid modification in the postsynaptic GABAA receptor population expressed on the surface of the hippocampal principal neurons. Subsequent studies found that this rapid modification is, in part, mediated by an activity-dependent, subunit-specific trafficking of the receptors that resulted in the reduction in the surface expression of the benzodiazepine-sensitive gamma2 subunit-containing receptors and the preserved surface expression of the benzodiazepine-insensitive delta subunit-containing receptors. This improved understanding of the changes in the trafficking of GABAA receptors during SE partially accounts for the development of benzodiazepine-pharmacoresistance and has implications for the current and future treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory SE.",

The three dogs were affected to different degrees of severity, but all displayed signs of ataxia, generalised muscle tremors, paresis, hypersalivation and disorientation. Temporary blindness occurred in two cases. The three dogs were tested for the presence of the multi-drug resistance 1 gene deletion, which can cause an increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of moxidectin, and were found to be negative. Treatment included gastrointestinal decontamination, intravenous fluid therapy and benzodiazepines to control muscle tremors. All three dogs made a complete recovery within 48 h of ingestion.",

Current available agents for GAD are limited either by their slow onsets of actions, unsatisfactory anxiolytic effects or potential for abuse/dependence. Atypical antipsychotics have been studied as alternatives. Olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine immediate release have been explored in the treatment of refractory GAD and risperidone in bipolar anxiety with randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, but the results were not consistent. By contrast, quetiapine extended release (quetiapine-XR) 150 mg/day monotherapy yielded consistent anxiolytic effects across three studies that were superior to placebo and as effective as paroxetine 20 mg/day and escitalopram 10 mg/day but with an earlier onset of action. In a 52-week treatment of GAD, quetiapine-XR was superior to placebo in the prevention of anxiety relapses. Overall, atypical antipsychotics were relatively well tolerated, with common side effects of somnolence and sedation. However, in contrast to antidepressants and benzodiazepines, the long-term risk and benefit of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of GAD is yet to be determined.",

Furthermore, the samples were immunochemically tested for cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, amphetamine, methylendioxyamphetamines and benzodiazepines. A co-consumption of illicit heroin (HER) in the HMP was determined to be 50% but was significantly lower compared to the MMP with a co-use of 71%. The incidence was high because not only acetylcodeine (AC) as a very specific marker was considered but also other marker substances for illicit HER use. Amphetamines played only a minor part in both collectives, and the proportion of HER and methadone patients using cocaine was similar and decreased during treatment. Also, the benzodiazepine use decreased, and cannabis use was high in both collectives during treatment. Considering only the AC in the present study, a co-use of illicit HER in the HMP was similar to previous reports concerning HER-assisted treatment programs. If additional marker substances were examined, the suspicion of a co-use of illicit HER is markedly enhanced.",

    "199": "Newer treatment options for insomnia include the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zolpidem, zolpidem-controlled release, zaleplon, zopiclone, eszopiclone and the melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon. These compounds are generally well tolerated and present favourable safety profiles in comparison with the older benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Commonly cited impairments of memory formation and decrements in psychomotor performance are related to the mechanism of action of hypnotics, and are both dose- and time-dependent. These effects typically are minimal on the morning following night-time administration. The non-benzodiazepines are associated with some risk for dependence and abuse. However, concerns regarding such risks appear to be greater than warranted by empirical evidence. The appropriate therapeutic use of hypnotics is generally not associated with physiological responses that are commonly thought to lead to dependence, such as tolerance or discontinuation effects. Former substance abusers and psychiatric patients appear to be at greatest risk. The labelling of hypnotics was recently updated to incorporate warnings about very rare, but serious adverse events that have been identified in postmarketing surveillance. These events include anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction); angio-oedema (severe facial swelling); and complex sleep-related behaviours, which may include sleep-driving, making phone calls and preparing and eating food. This article will review the adverse event profiles of these newer sedative hypnotics, their effects on memory and psychomotor performance, abuse liability concerns and the most recent information about the rare adverse effects that prompted the recent revision to the labelling of drugs in the hypnotic class."
