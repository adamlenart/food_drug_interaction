    "0": "A purpose of the study was determination of the relationships between the brain levels of neuro-mediators: noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the development of tolerance to the sedative and anticonvulsive action of Nitrazepam. It was found that during tolerance development the GABA level increased in the cerebral tissue and changes appeared in the activity state of the serotoninergic system.", 
    "1": "Atropine, in combination with 1 of 6 other drugs, was tested in mice for the ability to prevent death by an otherwise lethal dose of the cholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine. The atropine dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.) was kept constant, while the dose of the other drug in the pair was tested in 5 geometrically spaced doses, ranging down to 1/16 of the maximum dose (which caused no gross behavioral signs). Atropine alone saved 20% of the mice. The combination of atropine and benactyzine saved 100% of the mice at all 5 doses of benactyzine; similar complete protection was afforded by the combination of atropine and the largest dose of an oxime, TMB4 (15 mg/kg). Over 80% survivals were achieved with the larger doses of atropine combinations involving hexamethonium, mecamylamine, and diazepam. No enhanced protection occurred with atropine combinations with the oxime, 2-PAM. The toxicity of the effective combinations, when used in high doses without physostigmine challenge, revealed that deaths occurred over a narrow range of doses of all combinations except atropine/diazepam. An additive toxic effect of atropine was suggested with its combinations with TMB4, mecamylamine, and diazepam, whereas no additive toxicity occurred with combinations involving hexamethonium or benactyzine (i.e., the LD50 of the combinations was about the same as for hexamethonium or benzactyzine alone). The combinations with the best therapeutic safety ratio were with diazepam (no deaths at a dose 10 times that which saved 100% of mice) and benactyzine (no deaths at a more than 50-fold dose).", 
    "2": "The topographical aspects of fast rhythms induced by different psychotropic drugs have been studied in patients by means of a previously described method. This method is based on the spectral analysis of 28 EEG channels over both cerebral hemispheres. The spectral parameters, computed over 2 min 40 sec, are put into a data base. The clinician can then decide which of these parameters will be extracted from the data base and then displayed by means of maps on a graphic terminal. Those maps are useful for immediate comparison not only of the fast rhythms' characteristic values but also of those from other spectral bands. As quantitative EEG analysis is more and more frequently used in psychotropic drug studies, a good knowledge of the topography of the rhythms induced by these drugs will help in the selection of the most useful derivations.", 
    "3": "In the past, pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines have been extensively described. However, knowledge about relationships between their plasma levels and pharmacodynamic effects are scanty. Therefore, we investigated under several experimental conditions the disposition and the psychological response of the short acting midazolam (single dose 0,075 mg/kg i.v. and 15 mg po) and of the moderate long acting oxazepam (30 mg/die for 5 days). Psychological and psychomotoric effects were evaluated by analogue scales (sedation index), d-2 letter cancellation test, reaction time, critical flicker fusion frequency and adjective mood list. In general, good correlations were found between those tests and plasma levels, especially for midazolam. Analogue scales and reaction-time proved to be most useful in our \"effect-kinetic\" approach.", 
    "4": "In isolated rat hepatocytes aromatic hydroxylation and oxidation of the 14C-phenazepame heterocycle were studied. Both these reactions proceeded with the linear rate in intact hepatocytes and aromatic hydroxylation predominated. After induction of cytochrome P-450 by phenobarbital the rate of the heterocycle oxidation was increased 3.6-fold. Rates of aromatic hydroxylation and the phenazepame heterocycle oxidation did not depend on administration of phenobarbital and 3-methyl cholanthrene into the animals. Effects of the factors studied (concentration of phenazepame, induction of cytochrome P-450 by means of phenobarbital and 3-methyl cholanthrene) on alterations in the rate of oxidation of both aromatic nuclei and the phenazepame heterocycle were estimated using dispersion analysis.", 
    "5": "Triazolam is a new triazolobenzodiazepine drug that is indicated for the treatment of insomnia. The usual adult dosage is 0.25 to 0.5 mg; for geriatric patients a dose of 0.125 to 0.25 mg is recommended. Triazolam is readily absorbed and quickly eliminated with a half-life of 2-5 hours, making it the shortest acting benzodiazepine available in the United States. Sleep laboratory and non-laboratory clinical trials found triazolam 0.25 and 0.5 mg effective in inducing and maintaining sleep. It remained effective in laboratory studies of up to one month duration and non-laboratory studies of up to six months duration when the drug was administered nightly. On discontinuation disturbed sleep for one or two nights was observed in some studies. Triazolam impairs performance for several hours after administration. However, unlike benzodiazepines with long-acting metabolites, triazolam is relatively free of daytime residual effects, which is attributable to its short half-life. Overall, triazolam is an effective and safe compound for the symptomatic treatment of insomnia complaints.", 
    "6": "Male hooded Lister rats were cross-fostered at birth (day 0) and reared in litters of eight. Within each litter, one pup was treated with each dose of lorazepam (0.25 or 1.25 mg/kg) and one was treated with the placebo vehicle. The pups received daily subcutaneous injections between postnatal days 7 and 21 inclusive. Starting on day 70 the animals were subjected to four tests of exploratory and social behavior: Open Field, Holeboard, Social Interaction and Home-Cage Aggression. The drug-treated animals showed an increase in submissive behavior, particularly when intruding into another animal's territory, but only minimal changes in their performance in the other three tests.", 
    "7": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological management of anxiety as an alternative to long-term benzodiazepine medication. Fifty patients were identified who had been taking benzodiazepines continuously for at least one year. No significant differences were found between patients who joined a treatment group and patients who were simply advised by letter to cut down their pills. Patients gave a variety of reasons for initially requiring medication and somewhat different reasons for needing to maintain chemotherapy, which suggested that pill-taking might be self-maintaining through withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "8": "Triazolam 0.25 mg was compared with nitrazepam 5 mg as a hypnotic for 26 geriatric inpatients in a double-blind cross-over study. Sleep quantity and quality and psychomotor performance were studied. The sleep quantity and quality were similar for both drugs. There were no statistically significant differences between the two drugs in the psychomotor tests. The results are in contrast to results from other studies and might be explained by the composition of the patient material in the present study.", 
    "9": "It appears that midazolam maleate with its short half-life, water solubility, lack of venous irritation, lack of serious side effects, and benign cardiovascular, respiratory, and CNS effects, may become a useful drug in the dental profession, especially in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery.", 
    "10": "Study of excretion of the tranquilizer phenazepam [7-bromo-1,3-dihydro-5-(2'-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one] and its pharmacologically active metabolite 3-hydroxyphenazepam with urine and feces of rats and mice has shown that the drug is excreted unchanged in extremely negligible amounts. During 5 days, 11.4% of phenazepam with reference to the dose administered is excreted with mouse urine. In rats, this metabolite is detectable in the urine only after phenazepam administration in a dose of 100 mg/kg.", 
    "11": "The benzodiazepines are the most effective, safest, and most widely used antianxiety drugs. As a class of drugs, there are few major differences between the various benzodiazepine derivatives. The main distinguishing features are different plasma half-lives and the presence or absence of pharmacologically active metabolites. Plasma half-lives vary considerably, from 2 to 3 hours to more than 100 hours. All benzodiazepines are equally effective in the short term management of anxiety and insomnia, and their classification into 'anxiolytics' and 'hypnotics' is not justified. There are numerous other indications for benzodiazepine use, such as muscle spasm in osteoarthritic conditions, and acute alcohol withdrawal, but the benzodiazepines have no antidepressive or analgesic effects. While there is no good evidence for their long term efficacy in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, the benzodiazepines are more effective and safer than their main predecessors, the barbiturates. Some of the benzodiazepines, particularly those with long plasma half-lives which are commonly used as hypnotics, have a prolonged duration of action and cause marked 'hang-over' effects. Alcohol enhances the effects of these drugs, and thus can also increase their side effects. Adversely effects such as oversedation, tremor, ataxia and confusion are much more common in elderly patients. Ever since the benzodiazepines were first marketed 20 years ago their use has increased rapidly, and it is now estimated that between 12 and 16% of the adult population in developed countries use tranquillisers at some time each year. However, their overall use has probably diminished somewhat in the last few years. Although their indications are very common, it is possible that some of this extensive usage may be the result of dependence. Until recently, published reports of such dependence were comparatively few. However, withdrawal symptoms have now been demonstrated in a substantial proportion of patients on long term, normal dose benzodiazepine treatment. The abstinence syndrome usually lasts for 8 to 10 days, and is characterised by insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite and bodyweight, tremor, perspiration, and a host of perceptual disturbances. More serious developments such as epileptic fits and psychosis are probably infrequent during withdrawal from therapeutic doses. The overall incidence of benzodiazepine dependence remains unknown.", 
    "12": "Exposure to short photoperiods induces gonadal regression in the golden hamster. This is accompanied by a fall in serum gonadotropins and changes in hypothalamic neurotransmitter turnover. We have attempted to correlate these changes with alterations in neurotransmitter receptor binding parameters. Compared to hamsters held in long photoperiods, opiate ([3H] naloxone) binding in hamsters exposed to short photoperiods is elevated in whole brain and in cerebral cortex but not in hypothalamus. However, beta-adrenergic ([3H] dihydroalprenolol) and benzodiazepine ([3H] flunitrazepam) binding are unaffected in whole brain, cerebral cortex or hypothalamus. Thus, changes in hypothalamic noradrenaline turnover rate previously reported may not be correlated with changes in beta-adrenergic binding.", 
    "13": "1 Development of tolerance and cross-tolerance to lorazepam and diazepam in man was assessed in a double-blind and cross-over trial where eight pretrained healthy students volunteered for four 1 week treatment periods started at 1 month intervals. 2 In each period acute psychomotor responses to oral lorazepam 3 mg and diazepam 15 mg were recorded on day 1, as well as on day 8 after 1 week's treatment twice daily with diazepam 5 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, and placebo. At each session several objective psychomotor tests and subjective assessments were done before the drug intake and 1, 2.5, and 4 h after it. 3 In general, the effects of lorazepam were stronger and of longer duration than those of diazepam at the doses used. When comparing the single-dose responses on days 1 and 8, tolerance to lorazepam effects and some cross-tolerance developed on several functions measured. Tolerance but not cross-tolerance developed on choice reaction errors whereas the opposite was found on flicker fusion. No definite tolerance was found on subjective effects. 4 The results tally with an assumption that tolerance to benzodiazepine actions develops at different rates on various parameters measured.", 
    "14": "1 The modifications of human sleep induced by benzodiazepines, and particularly by flunitrazepam, are complex. Stage 4 and paradoxical sleep are both decreased; however, these two effects have a different evolution during and after single or short-term drug administration. 2 The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 also tends to depress stage 4, but with immediate recovery in the post-drug night, and does not modify paradoxical sleep. 3 In combined administration, this drug totally reverses the hypnogenic effect of flunitrazepam, as well as its effect on paradoxical sleep but not the decrease of slow wave sleep. 4 Some of the benzodiazepine-induced alterations of sleep may be related to receptors different from central benzodiazepine receptors, or to mechanisms not directly connected to this type of receptors.", 
    "15": "New benzodiazepine derivatives continue to be developed and introduced into clinical use. The pharmacokinetic properties of these newer drugs can best be understood by their categorisation according to range of elimination half-life and pathway of metabolism (oxidation versus conjugation). Clobazam and halazepam are long half-life (and therefore accumulating) anxiolytics metabolised by oxidation. Alprazolam and clotiazepam also are oxidised compounds but have short to intermediate half-life values and therefore produce considerably less accumulation. Temazepam and lormetazepam are hypnotic agents with intermediate half-lives but metabolised by conjugation. The most unique of the newer benzodiazepines are the ultra-short half-life (oxidised) compounds midazolam, triazolam and brotizolam, which are essentially non-accumulating during multiple dosage.", 
    "16": "Benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytic agents when used properly. They have a high therapeutic-to-toxic ratio and a relatively low rate of physical dependency if the duration of use is limited. They are most effective in ameliorating generalized and post-traumatic anxiety and in relieving the anxiety associated with adjustment reactions. They are less effective for panic attacks and for phobic and obsessive anxiety disorders. The rate of absorption and type of metabolism determine the onset and duration of action.", 
    "17": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be divided into four stages, which should be recognized and treated to prevent progression to the later stages. Delirium tremens, the final stage of withdrawal, is characterized by extreme autonomic hypersensitivity and seizures. Treatment may include prophylactic use of sedatives or acute therapy for the management of seizures. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are useful agents.", 
    "18": "To characterize and quantitate pathways of stimulation of gastric secretion via vagal excitation induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose, we used graded doses of the two muscarinic antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine. Studies were performed in four conscious gastric fistula dogs with antral vagotomy to eliminate the gastrin release component of the vagal response. To further localize the site of action of the antagonists, both were tested against bethanechol, which stimulates secretion at postganglionic sites. Acid and pepsin secretion stimulated by either bethanechol or the vagus were inhibited in a dose-responsive manner by both atropine and pirenzepine, which displayed similar potencies. These data indicate that: 1) the vagus acts on the gastric fundus solely via muscarinic receptors; 2) the muscarinic receptors controlling gastric secretion are of the high-affinity (M-1) subtype; and 3) the vagus is very sensitive to atropine with D50 less than 1.4 nmol/kg. Heart rate was increased up to 120 beats/min above the resting rate by atropine; half-maximal increase was calculated to occur at 10 nmol/kg (ED50). Pirenzepine had a much less potent effect on the heart; the ED50 was 200 to 300 times greater than that for atropine. These data indicate that heart rate is affected by a mechanism acting via a muscarinic receptor pathway that has a low affinity for pirenzepine (M-2 receptor subtype).", 
    "19": "Women on low-dose estrogen oral contraceptives (OC) and drug-free control women matched for age, weight, and cigarette smoking habits, received single 2-mg IV doses of lorazepam or single 30-mg oral doses of oxazepam, two benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronide conjugation. Kinetics were determined from multiple plasma concentrations measured during 48 hr after dosing. Mean kinetic variables for lorazepam in control and OC groups (n = 15 in each group) were: volume of distribution (Vd), 1.33 and 1.45 l/kg; elimination t1/2, 13.1 and 12.2 hr; total clearance, 1.25 and 1.50 ml/min/kg; free fraction in plasma, 10.3% and 10.3% unbound. For oxazepam, kinetic variables in the two groups (n = 14 and 17) were: Vd, 1.05 and 1.19 l/kg; t1/2, 7.6 and 7.2 hr; total clearance, 1.60 and 2.03 ml/min/kg; free fraction, 4.6% and 4.9% unbound. None of these differences were significant. Thus, metabolic clearance by glucuronidation of lorazepam and oxazepam is not significantly affected by OC, in contrast with the highly significant reduction in clearance of the oxidized benzodiazepine diazepam.",

Kinetics were determined from multiple plasma concentrations measured during the 48 hours after dosing. Mean kinetic variables for lorazepam in control and OC groups (n=15 in each group) were: volume of distribution (Vd), 1.33 and 1.45 1/kg; elimination t1/2, 13.1 and 12.2 hours; total clearance, 1.25 and 1.50 ml/minute/kg; free fraction in plasma, 10.3% and 10.3% unbound.

    "21": "A single chain polypeptide, termed beta-RTX, with an apparent Mr = 9600 has been isolated from the venom of Vipera russelli russelli. It was purified by cation exchange chromatography, followed by preparative isoelectric focusing and chromatofocusing. Purity was confirmed by gel filtration, high performance liquid chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Amino acid analysis revealed the presence of eight half-cystines, one being located at the NH2 terminus, which are linked to form four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Chromatofocusing revealed some microheterogeneity yielding three isoforms with pI values of 9.3, 9.37, and 9.48, respectively. In its native configuration, beta-RTX was not susceptible to tryptic degradation but was readily digested after reduction and alkylation. beta-RTX possesses weak phospholipase A2 activity and competes with the binding of monoamines and opiate ligands to their respective receptors. No binding to histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, benzodiazepine, or muscarinic receptors was observed. In vivo, whereas 100 micrograms/kg intravenous beta-RTX seemed to be without apparent effects in the rat, 10 ng/kg beta-RTX injected intracerebroventricularly caused marked sedation, with full recovery within 3 h.", 
    "22": "The effects of GABA on the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to bovine cerebral cortical membranes was investigated in presence and in absence of benzodiazepine antagonists. The percentage stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA is higher when approximately 50% of the binding is displaced by benzodiazepine antagonists. The observed increase in percent stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA might reflect the preferential displacement of the ligand by benzodiazepine antagonists from a GABA-insensitive conformational state or site of the receptor.", 
    "23": "The brain and plasma pharmacokinetics of lorazepam were investigated in rats that had received 5 once daily injections of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg of the compound. The sedative effects of the drug were also assessed using a holeboard test. Thirty minutes after the final injection of 1.0 mg/kg lorazepam animals showed a similar degree of sedation to animals tested 90 min after their final injection of 0.5 mg/kg, despite having brain concentrations of lorazepam that were 3 times higher. Four hours after 0.5 mg/kg lorazepam, when the concentration of lorazepam in the brain was very low, animals' head-dipping and locomotor activity scores were still only 60% of the controls' scores. It is concluded that brain concentrations of lorazepam are of little use in predicting the behavioural effects of the compound.", 
    "24": "All-night spectral analysis of the sleep EEG was used to study the effect and after-effect of a single bedtime dose of flunitrazepam (2 mg), flurazepam (30 mg) or triazolam (0.5 mg) in healthy young males. In the night of drug treatment all 3 hypnotics reduced the EEG slow waves and enhanced the activity in the frequency range of sleep spindles. In the subsequent drug-free night, the latter changes were no longer present after triazolam, whereas the reduction of slow wave activity persisted after all compounds.", 
    "25": "Peripheral type of benzodiazepine binding sites were labelled in the kidney, the heart and the brain with [3H] RO5-4864 following intravenous injection in mice. The regional distribution of this in vivo binding parallels the in vitro binding: heart and kidney were more labelled than brain. Benzodiazepine potencies in reducing [3H] RO5-4864 binding in vivo parallel relative affinities for [3H] RO5-4864 binding sites in isolated organs membranes: RO5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam. PK 11195 a new compound, chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines, which is a potent inhibitor of [3H] RO5-4864 in vitro is also very effective (more than RO5-4864) after I.P. injection and oral administration. These results emphasize the feasibility of using this technique to examine the effects on various pharmacological and physiological manipulations of these binding sites in vivo. Moreover the fact that PK 11195 binds to these sites in vivo might indicate that this compound could help to elucidate the physiological relevance of the peripheral type of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "26": "[3H] RO5-4864 binding sites have been characterized in kidney, heart, brain, adrenals and platelets in the rat. In all these organs the following order of potency in the RO5-4864 displacement was found: RO5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam indicating that they correspond to the \"peripheral type\" of benzodiazepine binding sites. PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, displaces [3H] RO5-4864 from its binding sites in all the organs. PK 11195 was as potent as RO5-4864 in the platelets, heart, adrenals, kidney and several brain regions (midbrain, hypothalamus, medulla + pons and hippocampus. However it was 5 to 10 times more effective in cortex and striatum. In conclusion PK 11195 might represent a new tool to elucidate the physiological relevance of \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites and might help to discriminate the hypothetical subclasses of these binding sites.", 
    "27": "Twenty-five epileptic children were treated with clobazam alone for periods of 10 days to 36 months (mean = 9 months and 16 months for children who responded well). Satisfactory results were obtained in 11 patients and marked improvement with a 75% decrease in the initial frequency of seizures in 6 patients. The seizures recurred after a few weeks in 3 other patients. This preliminary study shows that clobazam is well tolerated and remarkably effective, especially in benign partial epilepsy, even in carbamazepine-resistant cases.", 
    "28": "Diazepam (0.4-0.8 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the spontaneous activity in the electromyogram (EMG) recorded from the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle of spastic mutant Han--Wistar rats in a dose-dependent manner. The depressant effect of diazepam (0.8 mg/kg) on the EMG activity was antagonized by Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg i.p.) and by picrotoxin (2 mg/kg i.p.), but not by bicuculline (2 mg/kg i.p.). These results suggest that diazepam depresses EMG activity of mutant rats by mechanisms related to the interaction of the drug with GABA-independent benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "29": "Effects of one week of benzodiazepine drug administration on central benzodiazepine receptor binding characteristics were evaluated in a series of experiments in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Administration of short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines was observed to increase the number of available receptor binding sites (Bmax) without changing affinity of drug for receptor. Furthermore, these changes did not occur after administration and withdrawal of long-acting benzodiazepines. In addition, there appeared to be a relationship between the affinity of the different benzodiazepines for the receptor and the degree of increase in the number of receptor binding sites. The results may help to explain the relationship between withdrawal of certain benzodiazepine drugs and the occurrence of rebound phenomena in clinical situations.", 
    "30": "The imidazopyridines EMD 35993 and EMD 41717 antagonized the anticonflict actions of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide in rodent models which are predictive for anxiolytic action in man. In contrast to other described benzodiazepine antagonists, these compounds did not antagonize either the anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties of either benzodiazepine. Both EMD 39593 and EMD 41717 competitively inhibit the binding of [3H]diazepam to brain membranes, but do not exhibit regional differences in potency. These observations suggest that both EMD 39593 and EMD 41717 display some selectivity in antagonizing the anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines, and as such may be useful tools in identifying neuronal substrates of anxiety.", 
    "31": "A rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the quantitative analysis of dipotassium clorazepate (CZP) and its major metabolite nordiazepam (ND) in fresh human and dog plasma. The method consists of two separate selective ND extractions from a plasma sample without and with conversion of all the CZP to ND. For quantitation, diazepam (DZP) is used as the internal standard. The chromatographic phase utilized in a reversed-phase Hibar EC-RT analytical column prepacked with LiChrosolv RP-18 with a solvent system consisting of acetonitrile-0.05 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 (45:55). The UV absorbance is monitored at 225 nm using a variable-wavelength detector. The mean assay coefficient of variation over a concentration range of 20-400 ng per ml of plasma is less than 3% for the within-day precision. Recoveries of ND, DZP and CZP (as ND) are essentially quantitative at all levels investigated. The calibration curves of ND are rectilinear (r2 = 0.99) from the lower limit of sensitivity (2 ng/ml) to at least 2000 ng/ml in plasma. Applicability of the method to CZP and ND disposition studies in the anaesthetized mongrel dog is illustrated. When the two separate selective nordiazepam extractions from plasma cannot be performed immediately after blood sampling, an extrapolation kinetic method is suggested for the estimation of CZP concentration. In all previous in vivo studies, CZP has been determined only with gas-liquid chromatographic methods.", 
    "32": "The neonatal injection of neurotoxic compounds such as 6-hydroxydopa (6-OH-DOPA) and DSP 4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride) produces marked changes in the development of central noradrenergic neurons, i.e. permanent denervation of the cerebral cortex and hyperinnervation of the brain stem and the cerebellum. Adult animals treated at birth with both neurotoxins were used to study the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) to membranes isolated from these regions. The administration of both toxins produced a marked and similar increase in the number of FNZ binding sites in the cerebellum. In the brain stem, 6-OH-DOPA increased the density of these receptors much more than DSP 4 (33% vs. 13%), a difference similar to that observed between the effects of both compounds on brain stem NA. In the cerebral cortex, both compounds reduced the maximal number of FNZ binding sites. No changes were observed in the affinity of FNZ binding sites in the different structures. When adult rats treated at birth with 6-OH-DOPA received an injection of DSP 4 7 days later, the number of FNZ binding sites was reduced by 43% in the cerebellum, 53% in the brain stem and 11% in the cerebral cortex. In these structures, DSP 4 reduced the absolute number of FNZ binding sites to the same level both in rats treated at birth with 6-OH-DOPA and in non-treated animals receiving DSP 4 7 days before killing. These results are further support for the existence of close parallelism between the density of benzodiazepine receptors, as demonstrated by FNZ binding, and the density of brain noradrenergic innervation.", 
    "33": "Membranes from cerebellum or hippocampus were incubated with various concentrations of [3H]flunitrazepam in the absence or presence of diazepam, Cl 218 872 or ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE). After binding equilibrium of [3H]flunitrazepam had been established, the membranes were either filtered for determination of reversible binding or were irradiated with UV light for determination of irreversible binding. Irradiated membranes were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Individual photolabeled proteins were identified, appropriate sections cut out of the gel, and the radioactivity in the gel pieces measured. The results indicate that [3H]flunitrazepam binding to individual benzodiazepine binding proteins and its inhibition by various drugs can be measured by the present technique and support previous evidence for the independent existence of various proteins irreversibly labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam and their possible association with different benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "34": "The irreversible incorporation upon ultraviolet illumination of the glycine receptor antagonist, [3H]strychnine, into synaptic membrane fractions of rat spinal cord has been investigated. The specificity of this photoaffinity-labelling reaction for the glycine receptor was demonstrated by the following results: (a) the Kd value (9.7 nM) of the glycine-displaceable irreversible incorporation of [3H]strychnine was similar to the previously reported Kd of [3H]strychnine binding to the glycine receptor; (b) pre-illumination of the membranes with unlabelled strychnine led to a corresponding reduction in the number, but not the affinity, of reversible glycine-displaceable [3H]strychnine binding sites; (c) the ultraviolet light-induced incorporation into the membranes of [3H]strychnine was inhibited by different glycine receptor agonists; other neurotransmitter substances had little or no effect. Also, [3H]strychnine alone was shown to be stable upon illumination with ultraviolet light; this suggests that photocrosslinking of [3H]strychnine may require energy transfer from specific groups of its high-affinity receptor binding site. Upon sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis a single labelled polypeptide with a relative molecular mass of 48000 was revealed from spinal cord membranes photoaffinity-labelled with [3H]strychnine. Spinal cord membranes photoaffinity-labelled with the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor ligand [3H]flunitrazepam, however, gave a single polypeptide with a relative molecular mass of 5- 0000. Treatment of membranes, labelled with [3H]strychnine, by endoglycosidase H did not alter the relative molecular mass of the 48000-Mr labelled polypeptide. Trypsin treatment, on the other hand, successively produced major fragments of relative molecular masses of 42000 and 37000. Also, even after extensive treatment with trypsin or chymotrypsin, greater than or equal to 90% of the radioactivity incorporated into the labelled membranes remained membrane-associated. It is concluded that the strychnine binding site of the glycine receptor is located on a protease-inaccessible, i.e. probably hydrophobic domain of the 48000-Mr subunit.", 
    "35": "Hemodynamic changes resulting from anesthesia and endotracheal intubation were studied in 32 critically ill patients. Cardiac preload, afterload, and output were measured utilizing Swan-Ganz catheter, arterial catheter, and thermodilution technique. Group I: 15 patients with known cardiac disease. Group II: 10 patients with no known cardiac disease, but with non-specific ECG findings and/or mild cardiomegaly shown by x-ray. Group III: seven patients with no known cardiac disease and without the ECG and x-ray findings of group II. Anesthesia and endotracheal intubation caused an increase in heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and a decrease in cardiac output and left ventricular function. Left ventricular function curves showed: group I - severe depression with no recovery; group II - moderate depression with only partial recovery; group III - moderate depression with full recovery. The severity of cardiovascular changes seen varied with the degree of pre-existing cardiac disease. It is concluded that patients with non-specific ECG findings and/or cardiomegaly indicated by x-ray have an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction during anesthesia and require similar preoperative and intraoperative management as do patients with cardiac disease.", 
    "36": "A case of severe abuse of phenothiazines, benzodiazepines and barbiturates and smoking 40 cigarettes a day throughout pregnancy is described. Intoxication requiring hospitalization occurred 3 times during pregnancy. The mother was hospitalized for the last 10 days of pregnancy and only lorazepam and oxazepam were given in order to improve the co-operation of the mother and to alleviate fetal withdrawal symptoms. At 39 weeks a healthy baby boy of 3150 g was delivered. Obvious withdrawal symptoms in the neonate appeared at the age of 20 hours. Due to repeated drug intoxications of the mother after discharge, the baby was located in a custody home. At his postnatal examination at the age of 3 months the baby appeared somatically and neurologically unaffected. A slight muscular hypotonia of lower limbs was suspected, though. At check-ups at the age of 6 and 12 months the baby was normal in all respects.", 
    "37": "In male Wistar rats, tissue distribution and excretion of fentanyl and its metabolites were studied after intravenous of intramuscular injection. Oxidative desalkylation leading to phenylacetic acid and norfentanyl proved to be the main degradation pathway in-vivo, whereas other metabolites, including the pharmacologically still active p-hydroxy(phenethyl)fentanyl were formed only in minor quantities. All compounds could be detected in any tissue under study (brain, lung, liver, kidney, muscle and fat) as well as in the gastric contents, the amount of fentanyl in the latter cumulating to about 2% of the total dose 60 min after injection, compared with about 10% in the fat. In rats chronically treated with ethanol, nicotine, morphine, phenobarbital, promethazine or diazepam, major differences in in-vitro fentanyl metabolism by liver homogenates were observed including both inhibition and induction. Phenobarbital pretreatment also induced extrahepatic biotransformation in kidney, adrenals and intestinal mucosa. On the other hand, tissue concentrations of fentanyl and its metabolites did not clearly reflect the in-vitro changes in metabolic activity. Fentanyl brain levels were found to be lower in the treatment groups but seemed not to correlate with pharmacodynamics, less effects following injection being observed only after ethanol and morphine. The in-vitro metabolic drug interaction proved to be of less importance than changes in diuresis and/or urinary pH when excretion products were analysed. As a conclusion, it is suggested that altered sensitivity of brain tissue rather than changes in bioavailability must explain variations in dose-response relationship which are frequently believed to be seen when fentanyl is used in patients with chronic drug administration.", 
    "38": "The exploratory behavior of adult male Balb/c mice was observed in both a small black box and an open field. The normal exploratory pattern included a strong tendency to groom in a preferred place (G-site); thus, an average of 86% (black box) and 92% (open field) of the total grooming time was spent in a single location, specific for each animal and environment. The response of the animals to a 2-sec, 100 dB auditory stimulus varied according to their location. If the unexpected sound occurred when the mice were in their G-site, they remained there an average of 67% (black box) and 75% (open field) of the trials. If elsewhere, they escaped and ran to their G-site 89% (black box) and 73% (open field) of the times. Mice treated with diazepam (5 mg/kg) showed the normal tendency to groom in a preferred place, but never escaped after the stimulus, even if it occurred when they were outside their G-site, nor did they resume normal exploratory behavior. It seems that the preferred grooming location is the place that serves as a refuge from an aversive noise signal, but only the latter behavior is abolished by diazepam, presumably by reduction of stress.", 
    "39": "Fourteen male heroin addicts being detoxified on methadone and 14 male pentazocine addicts being detoxified drug-free were observed over a 24-hour period for 2 weeks in their sleeping patterns to assess the effects of flurazepam upon sleep during withdrawal. Results of objective and subjective measures find that flurazepam use is associated with more objective nighttime arousals and less total sleep for the heroin group compared to the pentazocine group. Heroin patients felt they had a poorer quality of sleep and took flurazepam more frequently than did the pentazocine patients. Heroin patients' assessments of their sleep and number of arousals correlated poorly with observations.", 
    "40": "Neuroleptanalgesia was induced in late pregnancy in guinea pigs with diazepam and fentanyl-fluanisone. Hypotension occurred, but the arterial acid-base status after 45-60 min was near normal. When repeated injections of fentanyl-fluanisone were given to maintain neuroleptanalgesia, the blood pressure fell further and severe metabolic acidosis developed. Placental blood flow determined with radioactive microspheres was much lower during maintained neuroleptanalgesia than in guinea pigs anaesthetized with diazepam and pentobarbitone.", 
    "41": "The efficacy of the neuroleptanalgesic combinations of fentanyl-fluanisone with diazepam; and etorphine-methotrimeprazine, either alone, or with diazepam, was investigated in the rabbit. The effects of these drugs on some cardiovascular variables were studied in chronically catheterized rabbits. Fentanyl-fluanisone and diazepam produced good surgical anaesthesia. Although respiratory depression occurred, this had little effect on blood gas values. In contrast, etorphine-methotrimeprazine and diazepam produced severe respiratory depression with consequent hypercapnia and acidosis.", 
    "42": "I.R. spectrophotometry has been applied in emergency toxicological analyses. Poisons and drugs are extracted into chloroform, potassium bromide is added to the extract and the solvent evaporated. Potassium bromide discs are prepared by compression and scanned in an I.R. spectrophotometer. A data bank of standard spectra has been prepared and computerized comparison of the spectral data of the sample extract with those of authentic compounds allows the identification of toxic agents in 'real time'.", 
    "43": "1 Seventy five cases of ibuprofen overdose were recorded during a two year survey. 2 Details of the symptoms, treatment and the eventual outcome are known for 64% of the cases. The majority of the patients had no symptoms or only mild symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. 3 In the three cases where more serious symptoms were reported, the role of ibuprofen was not certain. 4 Laboratory analyses available for 13 cases demonstrate that plasma ibuprofen concentrations of up to 704 mg/l could be associated with no symptoms. 5 The data suggest that ibuprofen is of low toxicity in acute overdose and that therapy used should be supportive only.", 
    "44": "The predictability of the withdrawal syndrome on the basis of the drinking history immediately prior to detoxification was investigated in 43 patients admitted to an inpatient Alcoholism Service; a pilot study consisted of 17 patients and a subsequent definitive study of 26. After obtaining informed consent, blood alcohol concentrations were measured. Each subject was extensively interviewed to obtain a medical and dietary history and to determine alcohol and drug intake in the past week and months. The levels of intoxication and withdrawal signs/symptoms were assessed on admission and daily for at least 3 days. Urine and blood toxicology screens were also performed for 19 subjects. Contrary to widespread impressions, most of the patients were able to give a detailed account of their drinking and drinking-related behavior in the 3 days prior to admission and 73% could do this for the previous 7 days. Subjects were consistent in their reporting; 85% gave drinking histories consistent among interviews conducted independently by the medical, research and counseling staff. A significant correlation (r = 0.55; P less than 0.01) was found between the severity of withdrawal and the total alcohol intake in the days immediately prior to admission. No significant correlation was evident between withdrawal severity and the number of years of heavy drinking. Amounts of benzodiazepines (diazepam and flurazepam) administered by the medical staff during the first 3 days of withdrawal and for the total hospital stay were also found to be significantly correlated with withdrawal severity (r = 0.58; P less than 0.01 for both). Regression analyses of these data also confirmed the statistically significant relationships between alcohol intake and withdrawal severity and between withdrawal severity and amounts of benzodiazepines used for detoxication. Of special interest was the finding that 50% of the subjects reported no hangovers within he past year or more and 23% reported that they had never experienced a hangover, despite very heavy drinking. In addition, only 50% of the patients had regularly consumed coffee or any caffeine-containing substance; this low incidence of caffeine intake was statistically significantly less than that found in extensive surveys of the general population in which only 3-10% eschew caffeine-containing beverages. It is concluded that the severity of alcohol withdrawal can be related to a cluster of variables among which is recent alcohol intake. The present results are, at the same time, consistent with previous observations of the appreciable differences among individuals in the consequences of abrupt cessation of chronic alcohol consumption.", 
    "45": "1 Free fractions of diazepam, propranolol and warfarin were determined in 15 male chronic alcoholics in alcohol withdrawal. 2 On admission the mean free fraction of diazepam was 25% above and propranolol 44% below the limits of normal range, while the mean warfarin free fraction was in high normal range. One week later mean free fraction of diazepam declined by 20% while propranolol and warfarin increased by 24% and 19% respectively (P less than 0.05). 3 Propranolol free fraction and alpha 1-AGP concentrations were highly correlated (linear r = -0.83, P less than 0.001). In contrast the sources of variation in diazepam and warfarin free fraction were more complex and less certain. 4 Statistically significant changes of drug free fractions in serum of chronic alcoholics were observed during alcohol withdrawal. The extent and direction of these changes differed for various classes of drugs and their potential causes appear to be quite different. 5 Clinically important changes in drug effect may be present acutely, within the dosing interval, as a result of altered drug binding. These are more likely when the clinical response is closely related to drug concentration and will occur within the dosing interval due to larger fluctuations in free drug concentration, even though the average free drug concentration will remain unchanged. 6 Total drug level changes will be observed during alcohol withdrawal even in absence of detectable changes of drug metabolism.", 
    "46": "The interaction of several benzodiazepines (BDZs) with the nucleoside transport system of fresh erythrocytes from humans was investigated. The affinities of BDZs for the nucleoside transport system were estimated by measuring BDZ inhibition of (a) the site-specific binding of nitrobenzylthioinosine, a potent and specific inhibitor of nucleoside transport, and (b) the uridine transport processes, zero-trans influx, zero-trans efflux, and equilibrium exchange influx. The BDZs inhibited both the inward and outward transport processes, and, for individual agents, inhibition constants (Ki) were similar for the inhibition of each transport process and for the inhibition of the site-specific binding of nitrobenzylthioinosine. The order of potencies of the BDZs in their interactions with the nucleoside transport mechanism (Ro 5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam greater than lorazepam greater than flurazepam) is distinct from the potencies of these compounds at BDZ recognition sites. The affinities of the BDZs for the nucleoside transport system, which are about 1000-fold lower than for BDZ recognition sites, suggest that significant inhibition is unlikely to occur with the plasma concentrations (less than 1 microM) that result from usual anxiolytic doses of these agents.", 
    "47": "For hypnotics in which a fast elimination phase dominates the plasma decay, the initial fall in concentration from the peak value may nevertheless be slower than that of compounds with a sustained and rapid distribution. Drugs with fast elimination may therefore improve sleep throughout the rest period, even though residual sequelae, if any, around awakening will disappear rapidly. In the context of the balance between efficacy and residual effects, the activity of two imidazobenzodiazepines, loprazolam (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg) and midazolam (10, 20, and 30 mg), each with fast elimination (about 6 and 2 hours, respectively) has been studied in healthy men with sleep electroencephalography, measures of performance, and assessments of mood. Loprazolam may be appropriate when a sustained hypnotic effect is required and when some residual activity is acceptable, while midazolam is likely to be suitable for those involved in skilled activity and may be useful in the management of sleep disturbance associated with shift work.", 
    "48": "A patient with familial paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis (FPDC) who was only transiently improved on daily benzodiazepine therapy showed sustained benefit from a regimen of alternate-day oxazepam therapy. Our findings confirm that FPDC is responsive to benzodiazepine therapy and suggest that an alternate-day dosing schedule, using a short-acting benzodiazepine, may minimize receptor down regulation and thereby sustain the therapeutic effect.", 
    "49": "A male patient with chronic insomnia experienced withdrawal symptoms when flurazepam (30 mg h.s.), which he had taken nightly for 8 years, was abruptly discontinued. Problems associated with sedative-hypnotic medication and the long-term treatment of chronic insomnia are discussed.", 
    "50": "In a prospective study, 62 adult patients were studied with respect to the volume and pH of their gastric contents after receiving randomly one of three different premedications. One group received flunitrazepam 2 mg perorally on the night before operation and diazepam 0.2 mg per kg body weight perorally at 7.00 a.m. on the day of operation. The patients in the second group were given flunitrazepam 2 mg perorally the night before operation and morphine/scopolamine i.m. 1 h prior to operation. In the third group no flunitrazepam was given on the night before operation, and the patients were premedicated with morphine/scopolamine i.m. 1 h preoperatively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups with respect to the volume and pH of gastric contents after induction of anaesthesia.", 
    "51": "Prenatal exposure to diazepam in the rat from day 15 to day 21 of gestation induced a decrease in serum thyroxine levels in both male and female animals at 3 and 6 weeks of age. Furthermore, female rats exposed prenatally to diazepam showed an increase in the TSH response to synthetic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) when tested at 10-12 weeks of age, though their serum thyroxine level was normal. The results suggest that prenatal exposure to diazepam in rats during the last week of gestation affects the functional development of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.", 
    "52": "A 15-month-old infant had hyperpyrexia and severe generalized seizures without cardiovascular toxicity after the ingestion of 250 mg of amoxapine, a new tricyclic antidepressant of the dibenzoxapine subclass. The seizures failed to respond to physostigmine or the usual anticonvulsant therapies, but were controlled after eight hours by a second administration of diazepam. The child died 144 hours after amoxapine ingestion.", 
    "53": "We encountered an apparent bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) in a stuporous patient who used narcotics and benzodiazepines and had taken phenytoin sodium for drug-withdrawal seizures. The INO was promptly reversed by administration of the narcotic antagonist naloxone, which binds opiate receptors. This suggests the INO resulted from a specific toxic effect of narcotics, but opiate receptors have not been anatomically demonstrated within the medial longitudinal fasciculus or associated structures. Stimulation of inhibitory GABA-ergic (alpha-aminobutyric acid) vestibulo-ocular fibers may have been related to INO in this case.", 
    "54": "The contractile effects of diazepam (10-200 microM) were studied on twitch and tetanus responses of isolated fibres of the semitendinosus muscle of Rana temporaria (3.5-5.0 degrees C). Diazepam (100-200 microM) enhanced the twitch amplitude to 95-100% of maximum tetanic force and increased the rate of rise of force, the time to peak twitch force and the total duration of the relaxation phase. The maximum tetanic output was unaffected by diazepam but the drug increased the rate of rise of the tetanic force and delayed the onset of force decay after the last stimulus. However, the kinetics of relaxation was unaffected by the drug. Diazepam had no effect on either threshold, submaximum or maximum contracture responses to caffeine and to increased potassium concentration. Diazepam in concentrations producing full twitch potentiation caused only a moderate (ca 30%) increase in action potential duration. The results are in line with the idea that 1: diazepam enhances the twitch response by increasing the rate of release of activator calcium without affecting the rate of calcium resequestration and 2: diazepam acts by modulating a mechanism in the excitation-contraction coupling that responds specifically to membrane excitation.", 
    "55": "Within our study population of 100 women for whom 3,980 urine toxicology reports were accomplished, 98 percent were multi-drug users. This proportion is far greater than would have been calculated from the percent of urines that were positive for the drugs of abuse and is a more realistic estimate of the extent of the problem than is often reported. Despite this high percentage of multi-drug use, due to the uniqueness of our patient population (pregnant women), it is not possible to deny them pharmacologic therapy for their addiction. Therefore, the use of urine toxicology reports in our clinical setting has broader implications than adherence to the methadone regulations. These reports serve as excellent devices to assess newborn abstinence symptomatology, in addition to helping us monitor the physical and psychological status of our patients. The implications are that self-medication may be used to achieve a particular effect concomitant with methadone therapy. The effects are generally to enhance the action of methadone and to decrease undesirable side effects.", 
    "56": "Opiate peptides are known to elevate circulating GH in man, and data in other animals suggest that acetylcholine may be involved. We have administered the long-acting met-enkephalin analogue DAMME to 6 normal males, and have shown that the resulting elevation in GH is blocked by the specific cholinergic antagonist, pirenzepine. It seems likely that a cholinergic mechanism may interact with opiate-induced changes in GH in man.", 
    "57": "Twelve acutely manic patients, newly admitted from the emergency room, were treated wih clonazepam or lithium carbonate in a double-blind cross-over design: half the patients chosen randomly received 10 days of treatment with clonazepam followed immediately by 10 days of treatment with lithium, while the others received the same treatments in reverse order. Clonazepam was found to be significantly more efficacious than lithium in reducing manic symptoms despite the fact that during clonazepam treatment less patients required PRNs of haloperidol. Furthermore, both the total dose of PRN haloperidol and the number of days it was needed were significantly lower during clonazepam treatment than during lithium treatment. Clonazepam had a rapid onset of action, was highly sedative, and was well tolerated at high doses. By reducing the need for neuroleptics in the treatment of acute mania, clonazepam may decrease the risk of tardive dyskinesia in manic patients.", 
    "58": "Psychomotor effects of diazepam, 5 and 10 mg, were compared to placebo in 30 highly anxious, nonpsychotic outpatients and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Diazepam did not reduce anxiety according to psychiatrists' ratings, but 10 mg of diazepam three times a day reduced the scores of the self-rated visual analogue scale for anxiety compared to placebo. Diazepam, 5 mg, was devoid of adverse psychomotor effects, but diazepam, 10 mg, impaired tracking and divided attention task performance in patients and volunteers alike. Plasma, erythrocyte, and saliva diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam concentrations did not correlate with the impairment of psychomotor skills over time.", 
    "59": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled three-way cross over study, the efficacy of Ro 15-1788 200 mg, a new benzodiazepine antagonist, in blocking the amnesic, cognitive, psychomotor and subjective effects of diazepam 20 mg, was investigated in a group of six healthy male volunteers. The amnesic effects of diazepam were markedly attenuated by the combined administration of Ro 15-1788. The psychomotor and subjective effects of diazepam by mouth were most pronounced 2.5 h after administration. Concurrent oral administration of Ro 15-1788 completely prevented these effects at 2.5 h. Plasma diazepam concentrations observed after administration of the combination of diazepam and the antagonist did not differ from those observed following diazepam alone.", 
    "60": "The aim of this study was to see if the immediate EEG and clinical response to an intravenous dose of clonazepam was predictive for the effect of oral clonazepam maintenance therapy. Four children with petit mal epilepsy were given clonazepam intravenously during continuous EEG recording. Clonazepam plasma concentrations were determined repeatedly with a high performance liquid chromatographic method using a reversed phase system. The day after the intravenous dose the patients were given oral therapy with clonazepam. Repeated long-term EEG recordings were made and plasma concentrations of clonazepam were determined. There was no clinically satisfactory effect of clonazepam during oral maintenance treatment in three of the children who responded well to the intravenous dose of clonazepam. Thus, the immediate response to intravenous clonazepam was not a good predictor of the long-term effects in our patients.", 
    "61": "Five medically stable male patients with cirrhosis and four healthy age- and sex-matched controls received single 5-mg oral doses of diazepam (DZ) daily for 22 consecutive days. Plasma concentrations of DZ and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) were measured daily during the period of dosing and in the 7-day washout period that followed. Clinical self-ratings of sedation, fatigue, mood state, and sleep patterns were obtained daily during the period of dosage with the use of visual analogue scales. Steady-state plasma DZ concentrations were higher (165 and 98 ng/ml), and DMDZ concentrations tended to be higher (399 and 206 ng/ml), in cirrhotics than in controls. Increases in self-rated daytime sedation also were greater in cirrhotics than in controls and correlated strongly with total DZ and DMDZ plasma concentration during the first 2 wk of diazepam dosing. Thus, reduced clearance of DZ in cirrhotics leads to increased cumulation during long-term dosing. This in turn is associated with increased clinical sedation. Sedative effects are partly offset as treatment proceeds because of adaptation or tolerance. Based on kinetic findings, diazepam can be given safely to cirrhotic patients provided daily dosage is reduced by approximately 50%.", 
    "62": "A practical approach to the emergency management of seizures and seizure-like nonepileptic states in childhood has been presented. The management of tonic-clonic, absence, partial complex, and focal status epilepticus was discussed. Management of the child who has had a recent episode but does not present with a seizure was outlined, with particular attention to relevant history taking, general and neurologic examinations, laboratory tests, and treatment options. Finally, seizure-like nonepileptic disorders were reviewed and differential diagnostic points highlighted.", 
    "63": "The effect of 5 mg of intravenous diazepam (Valium) on contrast media-associated seizure incidence was studied in a randomized controlled trial involving 284 patients with known or suspected brain metastases undergoing cerebral computed tomography. Of these patients, 188 were found to have brain metastases, and it is estimated that for this subgroup prophylactic diazepam reduces the risk of contrast-associated seizure by a factor of 0.26. Seizures occurred in three of 96 patients with metastases on diazepam and in 14 of 92 patients with metastases but without diazepam. Factors related to increased risk of contrast media-associated seizures are: (1) prior seizure history due to brain metastases and/or prior contrast, (2) progressive cerebral metastases, and (3) prior or concurrent brain antineoplastic therapy. Factors not related to an increased risk of these seizures are: (1) contrast media dosage, chemical composition, or osmolarity, (2) computed tomographic appearance of metastases, and (3) type of primary malignancy. Concomitant therapeutic levels of diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin) do not protect completely against contrast media-associated seizures. Pathophysiology of contrast media-associated seizures is discussed in view of the risk factors determined by this study.", 
    "64": "Characteristics of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were investigated in the rat central nervous system by radioreceptor assay (RRA). Scatchard analysis revealed that the rat brain had two distinct GABA binding sites with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 11.7 nM and 34.7 nM. The highest level of specific [3H]-GABA binding was found in the rat cerebellum. Imidazole acetic acid, a potent GABA agonist, was effective in displacing [3H]-GABA binding but beta-alanine was slightly effective in inhibiting [3H]-GABA binding. Muscimol, the most potent GABA agonist, has been used as a ligand to characterize the postsynaptic GABA receptors. However, the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of muscimol-RRA was about 3 times larger than that of GABA-RRA, suggesting that muscimol might label not only GABA receptors but other unknown receptors as well. An endogenous inhibitor of GABA receptor binding was purified from the P2 fraction of rat brain with 0.05% Triton X-100. The endogenous inhibitor was competitive with GABA on GABA binding sites. The inhibition by the endogenous inhibitor of GABA receptor binding was blocked by the allosteric effect of diazepam. In the presence of diazepam, [3H]-GABA binding with the endogenous inhibitor was larger than that with GABA, whereas there was no difference in the absence of diazepam. This indicated that the endogenous inhibitor was not GABA itself. The molecular weight of the endogenous inhibitor was estimate by gel filtration to be less than 3,000 daltons.", 
    "65": "Cultures of fetal mouse spinal cord were assayed for the development of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor on intact cells in situ. At 2 and 3 weeks in culture, levels of binding were low and Scatchard analysis was linear revealing a single binding site with Kds of 115 and 71 nM, respectively. After 4 weeks in culture, coincident with large increases in neuronal (clonazepam displaceable) and nonneuronal (Ro5-4864 displaceable) binding. Scatchard plots became non-linear revealing 2 distinct binding sites with Kds of 11 and 175 nM.", 
    "66": "Fluoxetine and nine other antidepressant drugs which interact with brain receptors for neurotransmitters were studied in vitro using radioligand-binding techniques and transmitter-coupled adenylate cyclase assays. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs (desipramine, imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline and doxepin) had marked affinity for alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic and histaminergic H1 receptors, and lesser affinity for serotonin and dopamine receptors. Mianserin was relatively similar to some of the tricyclic compounds, whereas trazodone had less affinity for most receptors except serotonin and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Fluoxetine had little affinity for any of these receptors, and the same was true for zimelidine and fluvoxamine, two other selective inhibitors of serotonin uptake. None of the compounds showed much affinity for beta-adrenergic receptors, opiate receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, or benzodiazepine receptors. The present findings with fluoxetine are consistent with the virtual absence of anticholinergic or other side effects often observed with tricyclic antidepressant drugs in animal models or during the treatment of depressed patients.", 
    "67": "By using Vogel's method to test the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines and reducing the intensity of the current delivered to the drinking tube, it is possible to distinguish the pharmacological activity of three types of ligands for the benzodiazepine recognition site. An anticonflict action typical of anxiolytic benzodiazepines, a proconflict action typical of many beta-carbolines, including FG 7142 (beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester methyl amide), and an antagonistic action of the proconflict and anticonflict actions typical of RO 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5, 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazol[1,5-alpha]-[1, 4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and CGS 8216 (2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-(5H)-one). Pentylenetetrazole, which causes convulsions by interacting with a subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor that is different from the benzodiazepine recognition site, also induces a proconflict action that is antagonized by anxiolytic benzodiazepines but not by RO 15-1788."
