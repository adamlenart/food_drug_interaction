Renewed interest has been expressed in this seizure model with the recognition that it is sensitive to a broad spectrum of anticonvulsants (AEDs) and may have distinct pharmacologic responsiveness from other in vivo tests of AED efficacy. Here we sought to determine whether the progesterone-derived neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone (5alpha,3alpha-P) and several structural analogues with varying degrees of activity as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors are protective in the 6-Hz seizure model.",

RSE was successfully treated with PRO in 21 (67%) episodes and with THP after PRO in three (10%). Median PRO injection rate was 4.8 mg/kg/h (range, 2.1-13), median duration of PRO treatment was 3 days (range, 1-9), and median duration of ICU stay was 7 days (range, 2-42). In 24 episodes in which the patient survived, shivering after general anesthesia was seen in 10 episodes, transient dystonia and hyperlipemia in one each, and mild neuropsychological impairment in five.

The suggested extraction method makes it possible to isolate the above compounds from urine simultaneously and, after derivatization, to determine them by gas chromatography (GC) with programmed temperature within one stage analysis session. GC tests were performed on 2 both foreign and Russian QCC with SE-52.

The limit of detecting the TFA-derivatives was 1-2 ng for the plasma-ionizing detector. The extraction method as well as the positive and negative aspects of using the TFA-derivatives are under discussion.

Using this effect as a model system, this study evaluated the antidepressant potential of the atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine. In an initial study, rats were treated i.p. with saline, olanzapine (3 mg/kg), or imipramine (15 mg/kg) once daily for 18 d. Three additional groups of rats received the same treatments that were overlapped with reserpine administration (0.5 mg/kg.d for 21 d). In a second study, groups of rats were treated twice daily with saline, olanzapine (5 mg/kg.d), fluoxetine (15 mg/kg.d), or fluoxetine (15 mg/kg.d) plus olanzapine (5 mg/kg.d) for 1, 6, 12 and 18 d. In the initial study, imipramine produced a 45% reduction in LC TH levels, while olanzapine had no effect. In reserpinized rats, olanzapine exhibited an action that was opposite to that of imipramine, although this effect did not reach statistical significance. In the second study, olanzapine treatment alone or in combination with fluoxetine up-regulated TH in the LC, while fluoxetine alone had no effect. When fluoxetine was co-administered, olanzapine-induced increases in LC TH were more robust and occurred earlier in the time-course of treatment. Based on this preclinical model alone, olanzapine did not exhibit typical antidepressant properties. The unique effect of olanzapine to elevate LC TH may result from olanzapine-induced increases in LC activity. Such an action may contribute to novel behavioural effects of this atypical antipsychotic drug, including enhanced attention.", 
    "21": "Treating older patients with neurodegenerative disorders involves numerous challenges. The older patient population is expected to increase appreciably in the coming years; thus, there will be increasing numbers of these individuals requiring treatment. As a result, the appropriate choice of psychopharmacologic agents becomes an important decision in treating older patients with atypical antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotic medications are replacing the high-potency conventional antipsychotics in the long-term care setting because of the lower risks of side effects. For instance, atypical antipsychotics have lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia. Double-blind placebo-controlled trials examining the use of risperidone and olanzapine have been published and indicate that both agents safely and effectively reduce agitation symptoms in long-term care patients with neurodegenerative disorders. For instance, based on these studies, the doses that appear efficacious in treating behavioral agitation in dementia are 0.5 to 1.5 mg per day of risperidone and 5 to 10 mg per day of olanzapine. In addition, there are open-label studies examining the use of quetiapine, which suggest that this agent is also safe and efficacious in patients with dementia. Doses used range approximately from 25 to 350 mg per day. Very few studies are available examining the newest atypical antipsychotics, ziprasidone and aripiprazole, in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. These studies do suggest that ziprasidone and aripiprazole are worth further study in the long-term care setting.", 
    "22": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, robbery) has caused alarm in the general public. Drugs involved can be pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, lorazepam, etc), hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem), sedatives (neuroleptics, some histamine H, antagonists), or anesthetics (gamma-hydroxybutyrate, ketamine), drugs of abuse such as cannabis, ecstasy, or lysergide, or more often ethanol. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), possess amnesic properties, and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood or even urine can be of little interest. This is the reason why this laboratory developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations where, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biologic specimens. Although there are many papers focused on the identification of drugs in hair following chronic drug use, those dealing with a single dose are very scarce. The experience of the authors is documented in cases involving zolpidem, GHB, lorazepam, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and flunitrazepam. The expected concentrations in hair are in the low picogram per milligram range for the hypnotics. Drug exposure is demonstrated by hair segmentation. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses but as a complement. MS/MS technologies appear to be a prerequisite.", 
    "23": "Amnesia following sedative-hypnotic drug exposure is discussed. Anterograde amnesia clearly occurs with many benzodiazepines. Several drugs are assessed: benzodiazepines and two hypnotics in particular that are structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines but share some of their properties: zolpidem and zopiclone. The amnesic effects of these drugs are described, memory process, biology of memory, and memory process impairment documented. With these drugs anterograde amnesia has been demonstrated to be dose dependent. This effect is associated with hypnotic drugs, however, the receptors are different. As regards forensic medicine, a significant and specific type of amnesia should be considered: amnesia automatism or amnesic complex automatism. Also, several cases observed in our laboratory are presented to demonstrate the impact of amnesia.",

Evaluation of insomnia includes a careful sleep history, review of medical history, review of medication use (including over-the-counter and herbal medications), family history, and screening for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Treatment should be individualized based on the nature and severity of symptoms. Nonpharmacologic treatments are effective and have minimal side effects compared with drug therapies. Medications such as diphenhydramine, doxylamine, and trazodone can be used initially, but patients may not tolerate their side effects. Newer medications such as zolpidem and zaleplon have short half-lives and minimal side effects. Both are approved for short-term use in the insomniac.", 
    "25": "Extinction following positively reinforced operant conditioning reduces response frequency, at least in part through the aversive or frustrative effects of non-reinforcement. According to J.A. Gray's theory, non-reinforcement activates the behavioural inhibition system which in turn causes anxiety. As predicted, anxiolytic drugs including benzodiazepines affect the operant extinction process. Recent studies have shown that reducing GABA-mediated neurotransmission retards extinction of aversive conditioning. We have shown in a series of studies that anxiolytic compounds that potentiate GABA facilitate extinction of positively reinforced fixed-ratio operant behaviour in C57B1/6 male mice. This effect does not occur in the early stages of extinction, nor is it dependent on cumulative effects of the compound administered. Potentiation of GABA at later stages has the effect of increasing sensitivity to the extinction contingency and facilitates the inhibition of the behaviour that is no longer required. The GABAergic hypnotic, zolpidem, has the same selective effects on operant extinction in this procedure. The effects of zolpidem are not due to sedative action. There is evidence across our series of experiments that different GABA-A subtype receptors are involved in extinction facilitation and anxiolysis. Consequently, this procedure may not be an appropriate model for anxiolytic drug action, but it may be a useful technique for analysing the neural bases of extinction and designing therapeutic interventions in humans where failure to extinguish inappropriate behaviours can lead to pathological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.", 
    "26": "Ketamine can provide protective effects, through its anti-inflammatory properties, as shown in animal models of septic shock and endotoxemia, and has elicited the heat-shock response (HSR) in experimental studies. The HSR has reduced the mortality after severe burns in rats. This study has tested the hypothesis that ketamine could be protective in experimental burns and that it could generate the HSR. One hundred and twenty adult male Fischer rats were randomly divided into five groups. Rats in the first group (n = 20) were sham-anesthetized. In the second group (n = 20), rats were anesthetized with ketamine and shaved. In the third group (n = 20) rats were anesthetized with midazolam plus fentanyl and shaved. In the fourth group (n = 30), rats were anesthetized with ketamine, shaved and submitted to 29% body surface third-degree burns using a brass bar. In the fifth group (n = 30), rats were anesthetized with midazolam plus fentanyl, shaved and submitted to 29% body surface third-degree burns using a brass bar. Mortality rates were measured at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 25 days. Liver and lung samples were collected from all groups for heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) detection. No animals died in the first, second or third group. Animals anesthetized with ketamine showed significantly decreased mortality, as compared to those anesthetized with midazolam plus fentanyl, from day 2 to day 10 (P < 0.01, Fischer's exact test) and from day 10 to day 25 (P < 0.05). HSP70 was positive in the lungs of animals from all groups, without any differences among them, and was found in none of the liver samples. In conclusion, the mortality was significantly lesser in ketamine-anesthetized burnt rats than in burnt animals anesthetized with midazolam plus fentanyl. Ketamine has not elicited the HSR in this model of experimental burns and, therefore, its protective effects were not shown to be mediated through this mechanism.",

Lesions were performed by microinjection of the cholinergic toxin 192 IgG-saporin into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. Single treatment with either the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist ondansetron, 0.1 microg/kg, or the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, 10 mg/kg, did not affect ACh release. However, the combined ondansetron + flumazenil administration significantly increased ACh release to a similar extent as a depolarising stimulus with K(+), 100 mM, at both 7 and 30 days post-lesion. Cortical perfusion with the combined ondansetron + flumazenil treatment also increased [(3)H]ACh efflux \"in vitro\" 30 days after lesion, suggesting that local events within the frontal cortex may participate in the interaction of ondansetron with GABAergic neurons, modulating ACh release in situations of cholinergic hypoactivity. No differences in the expression of 5-HT(3) and GABA(A) receptors in the frontal cortex were found after the cholinergic lesion. These results suggest that a combined ondansetron + flumazenil treatment would contribute to restoring a diminished cholinergic function and may provide a basis for using this treatment in the therapy of cognitive disorders associated with degeneration of the cholinergic system.", 
    "37": "A pharmacological dissociation of the relation between electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and behavior has been described for the benzodiazepines. While a decrease in high frequency EEG activity is associated with a decrease in arousal in drug-free conditions, sedative benzodiazepines increase beta activity. Non-benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor modulators can increase beta activity as well. To further study the relationship between rat behavior and EEG under GABA(A) receptor modulation, EEG effects of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) and zolpidem (2.5 mg/kg) were studied during different behaviors. Both drugs modulate the GABA(A) receptor, albeit that zolpidem shows alpha(1) subunit selectivity while diazepam is non-selective. A detailed analysis of rat open field behavior was made with a distinction of 25 behavioral elements. The EEG was segmented according to each behavioral element and a corresponding power spectrum calculated. Both diazepam and zolpidem increased EEG beta frequencies, characteristic for the benzodiazepines. However, the beta and gamma increase was specific for active behavior and not for inactivity. Interestingly, diazepam and zolpidem seemed to amplify, rather than dissociate, the relation between behavior and the EEG. It is hypothesized that the large increase in beta-3/gamma activity caused by diazepam and zolpidem is a compensatory mechanism that allows for behavioral activation, despite pharmacologically induced sedation.",

    "53": "The influenza-virus M2 protein has proton channel activity required for virus uncoating and maturation of hemagglutinin (HA) through low-pH compartments. The proton channel is cytotoxic in heterologous expression systems and can be blocked with rimantadine. In an independent, rimantadine-resistant function, M2, interacting with the M1 protein, controls the shape of virus particles. These bud from cholesterol-rich membrane rafts where viral glycoproteins and matrix (M1)/RNP complexes assemble. We demonstrate that M2 preparations from influenza virus-infected cells and from a baculovirus expression system contain 0.5-0.9 molecules of cholesterol per monomer. Sequence analyses of the membrane-proximal M2 endodomain reveal interfacial hydrophobicity, a cholesterol-binding motif first identified in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and human immunodeficiency virus gp41, and an overlapping phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding motif. M2 induced rimantadine-reversible cytotoxicity in intrinsically cholesterol-free E. coli, and purified E. coli-expressed M2 functionally reconstituted into cholesterol-free liposomes supported rimantadine-sensitive proton translocation. Therefore, cholesterol was nonessential for M2 ion-channel function and cytotoxicity and for the effect of rimantadine. Only about 5-8% of both M2 preparations, regardless of cholesterol content, associated with detergent-resistant membranes. Cholesterol affinity and palmitoylation, in combination with a short transmembrane segment suggest M2 is a peripheral raft protein. Preference for the raft/non-raft interface may determine colocalization with HA during apical transport, the low level of M2 incorporated into the viral envelope and its undisclosed role in virus budding for which a model is presented. M2 may promote clustering and merger of rafts and the pinching-off (fission) of virus particles.",

    "63": "A concatenation of data indicates that the pathogenesis of depression is related to an increased production and secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Benzodiazepines profoundly suppress the basal and stress-related activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system and discontinuation of these drugs results in rebound activation. We therefore investigated whether the extent of HPA system dysregulation is related to the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal in patients with depression. We performed the combined dexamethasone/CRH test before benzodiazepine discontinuation (taper-off max. 5 mg diazepam-equivalents/week) in 14 depressed patients (13 f, 1 m, mean age 54.6 +/- 14.6) who responded to the antidepressant treatment. The severity of withdrawal symptoms was measured using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) questionnaire. The depressive psychopathology was monitored using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Patients with more severe benzodiazepine withdrawal (CIWA-B-increase > 14 pts; n = 7) showed a significant higher cortisol and ACTH response in the dexamethasone/CRH test preceding the discontinuation of benzodiazepines than patients displaying less severe withdrawal symptoms (CIWA-B-increase <14 pts.; n = 7) (ANCOVA, p < 0.05). Both groups did not differ in the pre-taper psychopathology ratings and their basal neuroendocrine activity. In view of the GABAergic inhibition of HPA system activity and the anxiogenic effect of CRH, benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms may be partly due to a disinhibition of the HPA system during discontinuation of benzodiazepines.", 
    "64": "The current paper focuses on a relatively new and promising area of the study of EEG transformations during brain information processing based on the reduction of the signal to the discrete quasi-stationary segment sequences which may reflect individual brain microstates or discrete operations. In this framework, the complex brain functions require integration of several operations throughout the whole neocortex. However, the role of inhibitory brain systems in such processes is still unsettled. The effects of a single dose (30 microg/kg) of lorazepam on the operational activity of neuronal populations and on the temporal binding between them were examined in a double-blind randomized crossover placebo-controlled study with eight healthy volunteers. EEG measures at 20 channels were evaluated on two occasions: (1) eyes closed, (2) eyes open. In short, we conducted a two-by-two factorial study where one factor manipulated GABAergic neurotransmission (lorazepam vs. placebo), and the other factor was simply brain state (eyes closed vs. eyes opened). We were primarily interested in the main effect of lorazepam. In the present study, a connection between the mesoscopic level, described by the local functional processes (neuronal assemblies or populations) and the macroscopic level, described as a sequence of metastable brain states (remote functionally synchronized neuronal populations) was established. The role of inhibitory brain systems facilitated by lorazepam in the operational dynamics of neuronal populations and in the process of EEG structural synchrony (SS) (topological peculiarities) was addressed for the first time. It was shown that GABA signaling reorganized the dynamics of local neuronal populations and the remote functional connectivity between them.",

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has become the method of choice to detect ischemic lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) of the central benzodiazepine receptor ligand 11C flumazenil (FMZ) has been shown to be a reliable marker of neuronal integrity. These 2 imaging parameters were compared with respect to the probability to predict cortical infarction in early ischemic stroke.", 
    "66": "In 12 patients with acute stroke, results from DWI (median, 6.5 hours after symptom onset) and FMZ-PET (interval, 85 minutes between DWI and PET) were compared with infarct extension 24 to 48 hours after onset of stroke on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2-MRI). Probability curves predictive of eventual infarction were computed using respective DWI, FMZ, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for voxels of interest (VOI) later classified as representing infarcted or noninfarcted tissue.", 
    "67": "Ninety-five percent limits predictive of cortical infarction were determined for relative FMZ binding (< or =3.2), DWI signal intensity (> or =1.18), and ADC values (< or =0.83). Cortical regions with values beyond these 95% limits did not necessarily overlap with nor were fully congruous with final cortical infarct volumes. The respective median volumes for these regions were FMZ median 10.9, range 0 to 99.7 cm3; DWI median 15.2, range 0 to 116.0 cm3; ADC median 12.4, range 0 to 112.7 cm3; and final infarct median 14.9, range 0 to 114.7 cm(3). Overall, 83.5% of the final infarct, on average, was predicted by decreased FMZ binding, 84.7% by increased DWI signal intensity, and 70.9% by a decreased ADC value. The portions of the final infarct not predicted in the early investigation (false-negatives) were 4.8 cm3 (median) for FMZ, 3.7 cm3 for DWI, and 6.0 cm3 for ADC. The false-positive volumes not included in the final infarct were 0 cm3 (median) for FMZ, 5.1 cm3 for DWI, and 3.6 cm3 for ADC.", 
    "68": "These results indicate that FMZ-PET and DWI are comparable in the prediction of probability of ischemic cortical infarction, but FMZ-PET carries a lower probability of false-positive prediction. The final infarcts include tissue not identified by these imaging modalities; at the time of the study, these tissue compartments are viable and could benefit from treatment. The discrepancy in predictive probability could be related to the fundamental difference of the measured variables: benzodiazepine receptor activity is a reliable marker of neuronal integrity in the cortex, and movement of water molecules in the extracellular space might be a more variable indicator of tissue damage.", 
    "69": "Bortezomib (PS-341), a selective inhibitor of proteasomes, induces apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells; however, prolonged drug exposure may result in cumulative toxicity and the development of chemoresistance. Here we show that combining PK-11195 (PK), an antagonist to mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs), with bortezomib triggers synergistic anti-MM activity even in doxorubicin-, melphalan-, thalidomide-, dexamethasone-, and bortezomib-resistant MM cells. No significant cytotoxicity was noted in normal lymphocytes. Low-dose combined PK and bortezomib treatment overcomes the growth, survival, and drug resistance conferred by interleukin-6 or insulin growth factor within the MM bone marrow milieu. The mechanism of PK + bortezomib-induced apoptosis includes: loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; superoxide generation; release of mitochondrial proteins cytochrome-c (cyto-c) and Smac; and activation of caspases-8/-9/-3. Furthermore, PK + bortezomib activates c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK), which translocates to mitochondria, thereby facilitating release of cyto-c and Smac from mitochondria to cytosol. Blocking JNK, by either dominant-negative mutant (DN-JNK) or cotreatment with a specific JNK inhibitor SP600125, abrogates both PK + bortezomib-induced release of cyto-c/Smac and induction of apoptosis. Together, these preclinical studies suggest that combining bortezomib with PK may enhance its clinical efficacy, reduce attendant toxicity, and overcome conventional and bortezomib resistance in patients with relapsed refractory MM.",

The effects of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitors on anxiety are not fully understood. The aim of present study was to investigate the possible role of sildenafil, an inhibitor of cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase, on anxiety in the plus-maze test in mice. Sildenafil at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg had no significant effect on the behavior in the plus-maze test but at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg induced an anxiogenic effect. The combination of sildenafil (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and methylene blue (1 mg/kg, i.p.) abolished the anxiogenic-like effect of sildenafil. The combination of sildenafil (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and L-arginine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the percentage of time spent in open arms compared to saline-treated group. Diazepam at a dose of 2 mg/kg significantly increased the percentage of time spent in open arms (p < 0.05). Sildenafil at a dose of 3 mg/kg and the combination of L-arginine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and sildenafil (1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased the locomotor activity (p < 0.05). These results suggest that a nitric oxide-cGMP pathway seems to play an important role in sildenafil-induced anxiogenic-like effect.", 
    "82": "A key element in the regulation of mammalian steroid biosynthesis is the 18 kDa peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which mediates mitochondrial cholesterol import. PBR also possess an affinity to the tetrapyrrole metabolite protoporphyrin. The bacterial homolog to the mammalian PBR, the Rhodobacter TspO (CrtK) protein, was shown to be involved in the bacterial tetrapyrrole metabolism. Looking for a similar mitochondrial import mechanism in plants, protein sequences from Arabidopsis and several other plants were found with significant similarities to the mammalian PBR and to the Rhodobacter TspO protein. A PBR-homologous Arabidopsis sequence was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant gene product showed specific high affinity benzodiazepine ligand binding. Moreover, the protein applied to E. coli protoplasts caused an equal benzodiazepine-stimulated uptake of cholesterol and protoporphyrin IX. These results suggest that the PBR like protein is involved in steroid import and is directing protoporphyrinogen IX to the mitochondrial site of protoheme formation.",

Binding selectivity was determined to a large part by the degree of planarity of the fused ring system whereas functional selectivity was dependent on the nature of the heterocycle at the 3-position of the triazolopyridazine ring. 3-Furan and 5-methylisoxazole were shown to be optimal for GABA(A)alpha5 functional selectvity. 3-(5-Methylisoxazol-3-yl)-6-(2-pyridyl)methyloxy-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazine (43) was identified as a full inverse agonist at the GABA(A)alpha5 subtype with functional selectivity over the other GABA(A) receptor subtypes and good oral bioavailability.",

Binding assays to polyclonal antibodies to benzodiazepines and at the native benzodiazepine receptor on the membrane of rat hippocampal neurons were established to examine the dye-labeled ligands for their benzodiazepine character and their binding behavior. Both the fluorescein and the Oregon Green488 moiety led to a loss of the benzodiazepine receptor binding of the corresponding Ro derivatives. Antibody recognition and interactions to the receptor were observed for the tetramethylrhodamine derivative (K(D) = 96.0 +/- 9.5 nM) but with a high amount of nonspecific binding at the cell membrane of about 50%. In saturation experiments a K(D) value of 97.2 +/- 8.5 nM was found for the Alexa Fluor 532 derivative-antibody interaction. Investigation of the binding of this ligand to the benzodiazepine receptor in FCS cell measurements led to confirmation of high specific binding behavior with a K(D) value of 9.9 +/- 1.9 nM. A nonspecific binding of <10% was observed after coincubation with 1 microM of midazolam.

It recently has been reported to attenuate seizures engendered by acute and repeated exposure to cocaine in mice and neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine in rats. The aim of the present study was to determine whether chlormethiazole could also attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine, a behavior predictive of the subjective effects of methamphetamine in humans. In Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate 1.0 mg/kg methamphetamine [intraperitoneally (i.p.)] from saline under a fixed-ratio schedule of food delivery, the ability of chlormethiazole (i.p.) to (1) substitute for methamphetamine, (2) antagonize effects of methamphetamine and to (3) shift the methamphetamine dose-effect function was investigated. Chlormethiazole (18 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) partially substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine when administered alone (maximum group average, 60% responses on the methamphetamine-appropriate lever). Chlormethiazole did not attenuate effects of methamphetamine when coadministered with the training dose of methamphetamine. Instead, chlormethiazole potentiated the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine as demonstrated by a significant (about 2.5-fold) leftward and upward shift in the methamphetamine dose-effect function in the presence of chlormethiazole (10 mg/kg). In conclusion, the present findings suggest that there is a behavioral interaction between methamphetamine and chlormethiazole. The profile of this interaction is qualitatively different from that of methamphetamine and classical GABAergic drugs (i.e., benzodiazepines and barbiturates), suggesting the involvement of non-GABAergic mechanisms in the effects produced by chlormethiazole.",

YM928 (10 and 30 mg/kg p.o.) markedly suppressed the motor seizures and afterdischarge induced by electrical stimulation of the amygdala at generalized seizure-triggering threshold intensity. YM928 (10 mg/kg p.o.) did not induce apparent abnormal behavior, but did induce sedation at a dose of 30 mg/kg p.o. YM928 (30 mg/kg p.o.) showed a similar anticonvulsant effect at twice the threshold intensity as it did at threshold intensity. Diazepam (10 mg/kg p.o.) and phenobarbital (60 mg/kg p.o.) also exerted anticonvulsant activities. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) showed a similar effect at twice the threshold as at threshold, but the anticonvulsant effect of phenobarbital (60 mg/kg p.o.) was reversed when the stimulus was doubled. When YM928 (10 mg/kg p.o.) was administered 60 min before daily stimulation of the amygdala, the development of kindling seizure was significantly retarded. These results indicate that YM928 has anticonvulsant effects and suppresses kindling acquisition without sedative effects, and may be suitable as an antiepileptic drug for the treatment of complex partial seizures in humans.", 
    "92": "Miltirone, a tanshinone isolated from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been characterized as a low-affinity ligand for central benzodiazepine receptors. We have now shown that this compound bound with low affinity (micromolar range) to central benzodiazepine recognition sites but did not interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. It failed to potentiate Cl(-) currents induced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) both in Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant human GABA(A) receptors and in cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal cells, but it inhibited the ability of diazepam to potentiate the effect of GABA in these systems. Miltirone (1-10 microM) also partially inhibited the increase in the abundance of the mRNA for the alpha(4) subunit of the GABA(A) receptor induced by ethanol withdrawal in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that miltirone might ameliorate the symptoms associated with discontinuation of long-term administration of ethanol or of other positive modulators of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "93": "In this study, anomalous dissolution behaviour of tablets consisting of sugar glass dispersions was investigated. The poorly aqueous soluble diazepam was used as a lipophilic model drug. The release of diazepam and sugar carrier was determined to study the mechanisms governing dissolution behaviour. The effect of carrier dissolution rate and drug load was tested with four different sugars, in the order of decreasing dissolution rates: sucrose, trehalose and two oligo-fructoses; inulinDP11 and inulinDP23 having a number average degree of polymerization (DP) of 11 and 23, respectively. Diazepam was incorporated in these sugar glasses in the amorphous state by means of freeze drying using water and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) as solvents. None of the tablets disintegrated during dissolution. Dissolution of 80% of the lipophilic drug within 20 min was found when diazepam and sugar dissolution profiles coincided. The sugar carrier and diazepam dissolved at the same rate, which was constant in time and fast. This condition was met for relatively slow dissolving carriers like the inulins or for low drug loads. For relatively fast dissolving carriers like sucrose or trehalose with high drug loads, release profiles of diazepam and sugar did not coincide: diazepam dissolved much more slowly than the sugars. In case of non-coinciding release profiles, diazepam release was split into three phases. During the first phase non-steady-state dissolution was observed: diazepam release accelerated and a drug rich layer consisting of crystalline diazepam was gradually formed. This first phase determined the further release of diazepam. During the second phase a steady-state release rate was reached: zero-order release was observed for both drug and carrier. During this phase, the remaining (non-crystallised) solid dispersion is dissolved without the further occurrence of crystallisation. The third phase, starting when all carrier is dissolved, involved the very slow dissolution of crystallised diazepam, which was present either as the skeleton of a tablet resulting in a zero-order release profile or as separate particles dispersed in the dissolution medium resulting in a first-order release. To understand the anomalous dissolution behaviour, a model is proposed. It describes the phenomena during dissolution of amorphous solid dispersion tablets and explains that fast dissolution is observed for low drug loads or slow dissolving carriers like inulin.", 
    "94": "Olanzapine is currently marketed not only for the treatment of schizophrenia, but also for the treatment of acute mania and the prevention of relapse in patients successfully treated with this drug for a manic episode. A large body of good clinical trials supports these indications. In the mania trials, olanzapine was more efficacious than placebo, equal or more efficacious than valproate and more efficacious than lithium or valproate monotherapy when used in combination with either drug. A trial that compared olanzapine with haloperidol failed to show superiority of the atypical versus the conventional. Olanzapine showed a modest but statistically significant effect in the treatment of bipolar depression; this modest effect was substantially enhanced in combination with fluoxetine. The long-term trials showed that olanzapine was better than placebo in the prevention of manic and depressive relapse and not inferior to lithium or valproate. The combination of olanzapine with lithium or valproate was also more efficacious than lithium or valproate alone in the prevention of manic relapse in patients partially non-responding to monotherapy with lithium or valproate. All these trials suggest that olanzapine may be a valuable drug in the short- and long-term treatment of bipolar I disorder. However, there are some concerns about the safety and tolerability of olanzapine in this population, as far as weight gain and metabolic syndrome are concerned, which may be addressed in future pharmacovigilance studies.", 
    "95": "Alprazolam-XR is an extended-release formulation of alprazolam designed to deliver sustained therapeutic concentrations for 24 h after once-daily dosing. Plasma concentrations gradually decline as the time for the next dose approaches, but still remain above therapeutic minimum levels. The anti-panic efficacy of alprazolam-XR appears to be comparable to the original formulation of alprazolam. The main advantage of the new extended-release formulation appears to be its greater tolerability and safety. The speed with which high-potency benzodiazepines are absorbed, and rise to peak concentrations is correlated with both abuse potential and with the incidence and severity of common adverse events, such as sedation and cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Alprazolam-XR does not exhibit the sudden increases in plasma concentration characteristic of the original formulation of alprazolam. This pharmacokinetic difference appears to translate into a reduced liability of abuse and a reduced incidence of sedation and cognitive and psychomotor impairment during acute therapy. This would appear to give alprazolam-XR a more favourable benefit:risk profile than the original formulation of alprazolam. In addition, the once-daily dosing (as opposed to three or four times per day) reduces clock-watching, increases compliance and it eliminates the penalty of breakthrough anxiety and panic that many patients experience if they inadvertently miss a dose. It should be noted that long-term therapy with alprazolam-XR carries the same risk of dependence and withdrawal during discontinuation as the original formulation of alprazolam.",

    "98": "To image the possible alterations in brain regional GABAA receptor subtype properties in a genetic animal model of human anxiety, mice heterozygous for the deletion of GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit (gamma2+/-) were studied using ligand autoradiographic assays on brain cryostat sections. The [35S]TBPS binding assay was designed to reveal impaired GABA and channel site coupling shown to be more prominent in recombinant alpha1/6beta3 than in alpha1/2beta3gamma2 or beta2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. Increased GABA-insensitive [35 S]TBPS binding in the gamma2+/- mouse brains was evident in the cerebral cortex and in subcortical regions, the alterations being regionally similar to the loss of gamma2 subnunit-dependent benzodiazepine (BZ) sites as revealed by [3H]Ro 15-4513 autoradiography. As the gamma2 subunit protein is needed for synaptic clustering of GABAA receptors, these results indicate that the extrasynaptic alphabeta3 receptors can be visualized in vitro as atypical GABA-insensitive [35S]TBPS binding sites. The results suggest that GABAAergic synaptic inhibition is widely decreased in the brains of anxiety-prone gamma2+/- mice, while extrasynaptic GABAA receptors are increased. These autoradiographic imaging findings further demonstrate the need to develop GABAA receptor subtype-selective in vivo ligands to aid in assessing the contributions of various subcellular receptor populations in anxious and other patient groups.",

    "109": "The exponential growth in the prevalence of cognitive impairment of old patients leads the physicians to deal with a larger incidence of behavioral disorders (such as excitement,aggressiveness), and psychotic symptoms (such as delirium and visual hallucinations). The presence of psychotic troubles in dementia causes a remarkable distress to caregivers and involves higher difficulties in the patient management. The estimates of such troubles range between 15 and 75 %. Geriatric assessment and the management of behavioral troubles require a prompt evaluation of all their possible causes. As a matter of fact, their appearance often reveals a physical disturbance (pain, fever, etc.), or adverse environmental conditions, or it could also be a consequence of a multiple drug therapy. For this reason,the use of antipsychotics should always be preceded by an accurate clinical diagnosis.Anxiolytic, anti-depressive, anti-convulsive and anti-psychotic drugs are among the therapeutic strategies for the management of the psychogeriatric patient. Atypical antipsychotics seem to be able to decrease the psychotic symptoms, with low levels of therapeutic failure. They also reduce extrapyramidal effects and the growth of prolactine hormone, which is quite useful when dealing with very old patients. Risperidone and olanzapine are two atypical anti-psychotics, which already proved to be adequate and well tolerated during the treatment of schizophrenia and of acute maniacal disorders. Our experience, with a population of patients followed by our Alzheimer Evaluation Unit (AEU), confirms that a low dose of olanzapine (5mg/day) and risperidone (0.5-1.0 mg/day) are effective in lowering behavioral disturbances, and psychotic symptoms due to dementia. Even in the long run,low doses of these drugs are still well tolerated. Higher levels of risperidone (> 1 mg/die)often caused extra-pyramidal symptoms such as rigidity and dyskinesia, whereas higher levels of olanzapine (> 5 mg/day) lead to an exceeding sedation. The management of behavioral disturbances is one of the most important goals in the global treatment of patients affected by dementia, to the extent of improving the quality of life. Atypical antipsychotics are preferable compared to old-generation drugs, therefore, they are the key therapeutic strategy we cannot renounce.", 
    "110": "This double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of risperidone or olanzapine vs. promazine in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia(BPSD). Patients were required to be 65 years or older, to have DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) or a combination of both. A brain computerized tomography (CT) was performed for all the patients; 60 demented patients,27 men (45 %) and 33 women (55 %) were selected for this study. The University of California Los Angeles neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) was administered at baseline, then after 4 and 8 weeks. Patients had at least a score of 24 or more. The Hoehn and Yahr scale was used for evaluating parkinsonism. The scales were administered by an examinator who was not aware of the kind of treatment of the patients. After a wash-out period of 10 days,20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 76.6 +/- 6.0 years, were randomly assigned torisperidone 1 mg daily in divided doses (morning and bedtime) (Group A); 20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 82.5 +/- 9.3 years were randomly assigned to olanzapine 5mg at bedtime (Group B), and 20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 77.6 +/- 4.6 years, were randomly assigned to promazine 50 mg daily (morning and bedtime) (Group C). In case of lack of clinical response, after 4 weeks, the dose could be increased to 2 mg/day of risperidone, 10 mg/day of olanzapine, and to 100 mg/day of promazine in the respective groups. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis of rating scales over time (baseline, 4 and 8 weeks). At the end of the 8th week, a global improvement was obtained in 80% of patients treated with risperidone and olanzapine, vs. 65 % of patients treated with promazine (p < 0.01). The results show that risperidone in doses of 1-2 mg/day and olanzapine in doses of 5-10 mg/day are effective and safe in the treatment of BPSD. Risperidone presents a major and dose-dependent antidopaminergic action and seems to be preferable when hallucinations and delusions are prevailing symptoms, even if it gives good results on aggression and wandering. Olanzapine seems to be faster in its sedative effect, probably for H1 receptor blockade. Moreover, 5-HT6 antagonism may favor acetylcholine release and this explains why these patients have not presented a cognitive worsening. However, both drugs are comparable or even superior to promazine, with significantly fewer side effects of both anticholinergic and extrapyramidal character.", 
    "111": "Microinjecting the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine into the pontine reticular formation of C57BL/6J (B6) mouse causes a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-like state. This finding is consistent with similar studies in cat and both sets of data indicate that the REM sleep-like state is caused by increasing levels of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh). Muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been localized to the pontine reticular formation of B6 mouse but no previous studies have examined which of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes participate in cholinergic REM sleep enhancement. This study examined the hypothesis that M2 receptors in pontine reticular formation of B6 mouse contribute to the REM sleep-like state caused by pontine reticular formation administration of neostigmine. B6 mice (n=13) were implanted with electrodes for recording states of sleep and wakefulness and with microinjection cannulae aimed for the pontine reticular formation. States of sleep and wakefulness were recorded for 4 h following pontine reticular formation injection of saline (control) or neostigmine. Experiments designed to gain insight into the muscarinic receptor subtypes mediating REM sleep enhancement involved pontine reticular formation administration of neostigmine after pertussis toxin, neostigmine after methoctramine, and neostigmine after pirenzepine. Pertussis toxin was used to block effects mediated by M2 and M4 receptors. Methoctramine was used to block M2 and M4 receptors, and pirenzepine was used to block M1 and M4 receptors. Pertussis toxin and methoctramine significantly decreased the neostigmine-induced REM sleep-like state. In contrast, pretreatment with pirenzepine did not significantly decrease the REM sleep-like state caused by neostigmine. These results support the interpretation that M2 receptors in the pontine reticular formation of B6 mouse contribute to the generation of REM sleep.",

They were randomly assigned to treatment with clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol in a 14-week, double-blind trial. Incidents of overt aggression were recorded and their severity was scored. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was administered. Atypical antipsychotics showed an overall superiority over haloperidol, particularly after the first 24 days of the study when the dose escalation of clozapine was completed. Once an adequate therapeutic dose of clozapine was reached, it was superior to haloperidol in reducing the number and severity of aggressive incidents. Patients exhibiting persistent aggressive behavior showed less improvement of psychotic symptoms than the other patients. There was an interaction between aggressiveness, medication type, and antipsychotic response: risperidone and olanzapine showed better antipsychotic efficacy in patients exhibiting less aggressive behavior; the opposite was true for clozapine. Clozapine appears to have superior antiaggresive effects in treatment-resistant patients; this superiority develops after the patient has been exposed to an adequate dose regimen.",

Patients were divided into 2 groups according to Visual Analog Scale: pain 1-5 (Group A) and pain 6-10 (Group B). The beta-endorphin baseline values were significantly different between patients of Group A and Group B. Our data show that patients with levels of beta-endorphin over 8 pmol/L were less sensitive to pain, so that they become candidates for a traditional utilization of the benzodiazepines. However in the patients with beta-end levels less of 8 pmol/L should be suitable an anaesthetic as propofol because strong pain might provoke neurohumoral reflexes, cardiovascular alterations, and even a heart attack.", 
    "118": "Disturbances in critical cognitive processes, such as working memory, are now regarded as core features of schizophrenia, but available pharmacological treatments produce little or no improvement in these cognitive deficits. Although other explanations are possible, these cognitive deficits appear to reflect a disturbance in executive control, the processes that facilitate complex information processing and behavior and that include context representation and maintenance, functions dependent on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Studies in non-human primates indicate that normal working memory function depends upon appropriate GABA neurotransmission in the DLPFC, and alterations in markers of GABA neurotransmission are well documented in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia.",

Given the critical role that chandelier cells play in synchronizing the activity of pyramidal neurons, the pharmacological amelioration of this deficit may be particularly effective in normalizing the neural network activity required for working memory function. Because GABA(A) receptors containing the a(2) subunit are selectively localized to the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells, and appear to be markedly up-regulated in schizophrenia, treatment with novel benzodiazepine-like agents with selective activity at GABA(A) receptors containing the a(2) subunit may be effective adjuvant agents for improving working memory function in schizophrenia.",

The practices had been recruited into a randomised controlled trial of benzodiazepine withdrawal in long-term users. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients recruited to the trial, and non-standardized (conversational) interviews with practice staff. Sixty percent of long-term benzodiazepine users had taken their hypnotic for more than 10 years, and one-third for more than 20 years. Beliefs in the efficacy of hypnotics, and self-report of insomnia despite their use, varied according to the willingness to attempt withdrawal. The majority of patients reported no warnings from professionals about adverse effects of using benzodiazepine hypnotics. Half had tried to stop at some time but most attempts had been short-lived. Patients and doctors had distinctly different views of the advantages, disadvantages and risks of stopping benzodiazepine hypnotic use. Both increased patient awareness of the problems of long-term benzodiazepine use and an evidence-based approach to withdrawal efforts in primary care are necessary to reduce the consumption of medication that has little real benefit.",

Two hundred and one (0.9%) case mothers and 268 (0.7%) control mothers had chlordiazepoxide treatment during pregnancy, respectively. Our analysis showed higher odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI; 2.5, 1.0-6.0) for chlordiazepoxide use during the 2nd-3rd month of gestation in the group of congenital cardiovascular malformations. However, this association was found when exposure data were based mainly on maternal self-reported chlordiazepoxide treatments (80% in cases and 71% in controls). There was no increase in the rate of any specific congenital cardiovascular malformation type. In conclusion, therapeutic doses of chlordiazepoxide during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk to the human fetus, although a somewhat higher rate of congenital cardiovascular malformations cannot be excluded.", 
    "132": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Gene targeting of GABA-synthetic glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 67 and GABAA receptor beta(3) subunit induces cleft palate in the mouse. These findings appear to contradict previous pharmacological investigations using benzodiazepines and GABA itself, which indicate that GABA suppresses palatogenesis. Therefore, the effects of picrotoxin and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MP) on palate formation were investigated in the present study. Picrotoxin and 3-MP impair GABA functions by blocking the GABA receptor and synthesis, respectively. Pregnant mice in the critical period [Embryonic Day (E) 11-15] of palatogenesis were administered these substances by subcutaneous injection or continuous infusion at subconvulsive doses, and their fetuses at E17-18 were investigated. A complete cleft in the secondary palate was observed in 15% of 333 embryos in 28 litters. In the remaining fetuses, a complete cleft palate was not observed, but microscopic examination of serial sections revealed partial defects of the palate. Furthermore, rescue from cleft palate in GAD67-deficient mice was attempted by GABA infusion. Horizontal elevation of palatal shelves, which is not observed in nontreated mice, did occur after the infusion in all 14 GABA-infused GAD67-deficient fetuses, although cleft palate still persisted. These results indicate that GABA is required for palatogenesis and is consistent with findings in gene knockout mice.",

Fatalities involving buprenorphine alone seem very unusual while its association with benzodiazepines, such as flunitrazepam (FNZ), has been reported to result in severe respiratory depression and death. The quantitative relationship between these drugs remain, however, uncertain. Our objective was to develop an analytical method that could be used as a means to study and explore, in animals, the toxicity and pharmacological interaction mechanisms between buprenorphine, flunitrazepam and their active metabolites. A procedure based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is described for the simultaneous analysis of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine (NBUP), flunitrazepam, N-desmethylflunitrazepam (N-DMFNZ) and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7-AFNZ) in rat plasma. The method was set up and adapted for the analysis of small plasma samples taken from rats. Plasma samples were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction using Toxi-tubes A. Extracted compounds were derivatized with N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), using trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) as a catalyst. They were then separated by GC on a crosslinked 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane analytical column and determined by a quadrupole mass spectrometer detector operated under selected ion monitoring mode. Excellent linearity was found between 0.125 and 25 ng/microl plasma for BUP, 0.125 and 12.5 ng/microl for NBUP and N-DMFNZ, 0.125 and 5 ng/microl for FNZ, and between 0.025 and 50 ng/microl for 7-AFNZ. The limit of quantification was 0.025 ng/microl plasma for 7-AFNZ and 0.125 ng/microl for the four other compounds. A good reproducibility (intra-assay CV=0.32-11.69%; inter-assay CV=0.63-9.55%) and accuracy (intra-assay error=2.58-12.73%; inter-assay error=0.83-11.07%) were attained. Recoveries were 71, 67 and 81%, for BUP, FNZ and N-DMFNZ, respectively, and 51% for NBUP and 7-AFNZ, with CV ranging from 5.4 to 13.9%, and were concentration-independent.

Eighteen healthy elderly (8 epsilon4 carriers) received placebo or acute oral lorazepam doses (0.5 mg or 1 mg) in random sequence, 1-week apart. Cognitive assessment and plasma levels of pHVA, pMHPG, and p5-HIAA were determined at baseline and at 1, 2.5, and 5 h postchallenge. There was no drug-to-placebo difference in monoamine levels and no consistent relationship between changes in monoamine levels and cognitive performance, regardless of epsilon4 status. However, the 1.0 mg dose increased p5-HIAA in epsilon4 carriers, whereas it caused a reduction in noncarriers. Higher baseline pMHPG and p5-HIAA levels were associated with better baseline memory. The epsilon4 allele may modulate the effect of lorazepam on p5-HIAA, but further studies are needed to confirm this finding and elucidate its possible significance.", 
    "135": "Club drugs are substances commonly used at nightclubs, music festivals, raves, and dance parties to enhance social intimacy and sensory stimulation. The most widely used club drugs are 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as ecstasy; gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB); flunitrazepam (Rohypnol); and ketamine (Ketalar). These drugs are popular because of their low cost and convenient distribution as small pills, powders, or liquids. Club drugs usually are taken orally and may be taken in combination with each other, with alcohol, or with other drugs. Club drugs often are adulterated or misrepresented. Any club drug overdose should therefore be suspected as polydrug use with the actual substance and dose unknown. Persons who have adverse reactions to these club drugs are likely to consult a family physician. Toxicologic screening generally is not available for club drugs. The primary management is supportive care, with symptomatic control of excess central nervous system stimulation or depression. There are no specific antidotes except for flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine that responds to flumazenil. Special care must be taken for immediate control of hyperthermia, hypertension, rhabdomyolysis, and serotonin syndrome. Severe drug reactions can occur even with a small dose and may require critical care. Club drug over-dose usually resolves with full recovery within seven hours.

Given the application of drug discrimination to characterize receptor-mediated stimulus effects of ethanol and given the data showing altered ethanol responses in mice lacking the delta subunit of the GABAA receptor, these mice were characterized in an ethanol-discrimination procedure. It has been shown that neurosteroids will substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol, and this study aimed to determine whether the substitution patterns of neuroactive steroids or other GABAA-positive modulators would be altered in these mice.",

    "144": "The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of weight gain during long-term treatment with olanzapine under routine conditions. Weight changes in a sample of 27 outpatients with schizophrenic or schizoaffective disorder were assessed over a mean duration of treatment of 22 months (6-42 months). Treatment with olanzapine was started anew or switched from a conventional antipsychotic drug. Eighteen (66.7%) patients gained more than 7% of their initial body weight. Mean weight gain was 9.2 kg over the study period for the first year 7.7 kg, and only 1.7 kg in the second year. Due to some patients losing weight in the second year, the latter finding obscures the fact that more than 50% of patients gained considerable weight also during the second year (4.8 kg). Weight gain per month was significantly higher in patients with lower body mass index, yet the highest weight gain was found in the most obese patient. Weight gain under olanzapine is a serious concern, and should be monitored closely and countered by active measures.", 
    "145": "The study of cerebral variables associated with response to neuroleptics holds interest from both theoretical and clinical points of view. To date, no studies have aimed to identify predictors of response to olanzapine based on cerebral measurements. Here, we used magnetic resonance to assess the relationship between volumes of the prefrontal (dorsolateral and orbitofrontal) and temporal (temporal lobe and hippocampus) cortical regions and ventricles and, on the other hand, the response to olanzapine in 16 schizophrenic patients. Data from 42 healthy controls were used to calculate volume residuals in the patients, defined as deviations from the expected values, given individual age and intracranial volume. Residuals thus represent the effect of illness on regional measurements. The association between clinical change and those residuals was calculated separately for the positive, negative and total scores from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). There was a significant direct association between the degree of orbitofrontal atrophy and the improvement of positive symptoms with olanzapine. No predictors were found for change in the negative dimension. A trend was found for patients with larger ventricles to show a greater global decrease in total PANSS scores. Neither age nor duration of illness explained a significant proportion of the symptom improvement. This result, together with others from the literature, supports the idea that atypical antipsychotics may offer some benefit to patients with significant regional atrophy, and this may have implications for the choice of antipsychotic in clinical practice.",

However, pharmacokinetic interactions between the two classes of drugs remain to be explored. The present study was designed to determine whether there were different effects of steady-state fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of olanzapine and clozapine in healthy male volunteers. One single dose of 10 mg olanzapine (n = 12) or clozapine (n = 9) was administered orally. Following a drug washout of at least 4 weeks, all subjects received fluvoxamine (100 mg/day) for 9 days, and one single dose of 10 mg olanzapine or clozapine was added on day 4. Plasma concentrations of olanzapine, clozapine, and N-desmethylclozapine were assayed at serial time points after the antipsychotics were given alone and when added to fluvoxamine. No bioequivalence was found in olanzapine alone and cotreatment with fluvoxamine for the mean peak plasma concentration (C(max)), the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to last sampling time point (AUC(0-t)), and from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0- infinity )). Under the cotreatment, C(max) of olanzapine was significantly elevated by 49%, with a 32% reduced time (t(max)) to C(max), whereas the C(max) and t(max) of clozapine were unaltered. The cotreatment increased the AUC(0-t) and AUC(0- infinity ) of olanzapine by 68% and 76%, respectively, greater than those of clozapine (40% and 41%). The presence of fluvoxamine also prolonged the elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of olanzapine by 40% and, to a much greater extent, clozapine by 370% but reduced the total body clearance (CL/F) of clozapine (78%) more significantly than it did for olanzapine (42%). The apparent volume of distribution (V(d)) was suppressed by 31% in olanzapine combined with fluvoxamine but was unaltered in the clozapine regimen. A significant reduction in the N-desmethylclozapine to clozapine ratio was present in the clozapine with fluvoxamine regimen. The effects of fluvoxamine on different aspects of pharmacokinetics of the two antipsychotics may have implications for clinical therapeutics.",

In this present study we have investigated the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its associated effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity following intramuscular (i.m.) injection to soman-exposed guinea pigs (Crl:(HA)BR). Prior to experiments, the animals were surgically implanted with EEG leads to monitor seizure activity. For the study, animals were administered the following pretreatment/OP/treatment regimen. Pyridostigmine bromide (0.026 mg/kg, i.m.) was given 30 min prior to soman (56 micrograms/kg, 2 x LD50; subcutaneously, s.c.), followed in one minute by atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, i.m.) and pralidoxime chloride (25 mg/kg, i.m.). All animals receiving this regimen developed seizure activity. Midazolam 0.8 mg/kg, i.m., was administered 5 min after onset of seizure activity. Based on EEG data, animals were categorized as either seizure-terminated or seizure not-terminated at 30 min following anticonvulsant administration. Serial blood samples were collected for the plasma midazolam analysis; the assay was accomplished with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. The mean time to seizure termination was 8.8 +/- 1.6 min. The mean time-plasma concentration data were fit to standard pharmacokinetic models. The following parameter estimates were determined from the model-fit for seizure terminated and not-terminated animals respectively: apparent volumes of distribution (Vd) were 1.4 and 1.7 l/kg; area under the time-concentration curves (AUC), 15,990 and 15,120 ng.min/ml; times to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax), 1.66 and 2.91 min and maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) 535.1 and 436.6 ng/ml. These data indicate that i.m. injection of midazolam is effective at terminating ongoing soman-induced seizure activity. Additionally, the relatively short Tmax and latency to seizure termination demonstrate the rapidity of drug absorption and action respectively.", 
    "167": "The effect of extremely low frequency electric field (EF) on stress induced changes of plasma ACTH, glucose, lactate, and pyruvate levels was examined in ovariectomized rats. The rats were exposed to 50 Hz EF (17500 V/m) for 60 min and were restrained for the latter half (30 min) of the EF exposure period. The restraint stress significantly increased the plasma ACTH and glucose levels (P <.05: Student's t test). Restraint induced increase of plasma ACTH and glucose levels tended to be suppressed by exposure to the EF. Meanwhile, the EF exposure also affected plasma lactate level. Thus, the EF exposure significantly decreases plasma lactate levels in the stressed rats (P <.05: Student's t test). Although the precise mechanisms in the restraint dependent alteration in plasma ACTH, glucose, lactate, and pyruvate levels are not fully understood, our results demonstrate that the 50 Hz EF alter both stress responses and energy metabolism in stressed rats.",

Here we demonstrate that an additional property of M11L is the ability to constitutively form inhibitory complexes with the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak in human cells. This binding interaction was identified by both FLAG-tagged pull-down assays and tandem affinity purification from transfected and virus-infected human cells. M11L binds constitutively to human Bak and, under some inducible conditions, to human Bax as well, but not to the other Bcl-2 family members (Bad, Bid, Bcl-2). When stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, M11L effectively protects these cells from Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, thereby blocking release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 9, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We also demonstrate in coexpression studies that M11L can interact with Bak independently of any involvement with Bax. Furthermore, cells stably expressing M11L function to prevent apoptosis that is induced by overexpression of Bak. We conclude that M11L inhibits, in a species-independent fashion, apoptotic signals mediated by activation of Bak.",

Under placebo, there was a positive correlation between alpha power and metabolism of the bilateral thalamus and the occipital and adjacent parietal cortex (P < 0.001). Under lorazepam, the thalamic and parietal correlations were maintained, whereas the occipital correlation was no longer detectable (P < 0.001).
