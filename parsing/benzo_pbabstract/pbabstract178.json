Published methods for its analysis have used either therapeutic doses of MDZ, or, if employing lower doses, were mostly unable to quantify the two hydroxy metabolites. In the present study, a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the quantitative determination of MDZ and two of its metabolites (1'-hydroxymidazolam (1'-OHMDZ) and 4-hydroxymidazolam (4-OHMDZ)) in human plasma and oral fluid. After liquid-liquid extraction with hexane/dichloromethane (73:27, v/v), the analytes were separated on a Luna C18(2) (100 x 2.1 mm) analytical column using gradient elution. Detection was achieved using tandem mass spectrometry on an ion trap mass spectrometer. Midazolam-d6 was used as internal standard for quantification. The calibration curves were linear (R2 >0.998) between 0.05 and 20 ng/mL for MDZ and both metabolites in both matrices. Using 1 mL samples, the limit of detection was 0.025 ng/mL and the limit of quantification was 0.05 ng/mL for MDZ and the hydroxy metabolites in both matrices. Intra- and inter-day accuracies, determined at three different concentrations, were between 92.1 and 102.3% and the corresponding coefficients of variation were <7.3%. The average recoveries were 90.6%, 86.7% and 79.0% for MDZ, 1'-OHMDZ and 4-OHMDZ in plasma and 95.3%, 96.6% and 86.8% for MDZ, 1'-OHMDZ and 4-OHMDZ, respectively, in oral fluid. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study, showing that MDZ and its hydroxy metabolites can be determined precisely in in vivo samples obtained following a single oral or intravenous dose of 2 mg MDZ. The method appears to be useful for CYP3A phenotyping in plasma using sub-therapeutic MDZ doses, but larger studies are needed to test this assumption.",

In control hornets, the ovaries usually develop within a day or two post eclosion and comb building commences on the second day of life. The hornets then oviposit into the comb cells and the deposited ova give rise to larvae. Trials were performed on parallel groups of hornets of various ages. When the sedative diazepam was administered to hornets aged 0-24 hours the ovaries of these young hornets failed to show any development, so that no oocytes ripened and consequently there was no oviposition whatsoever. Neither were any comb cells built or, at best, only a few were built. When the diazepam was administered to hornet's being the age of 48 hours, it exerted no change, that is, the eggs developed normally and comb building was the same as in the control group. Longevity of hornets was uniform in all the test groups and similar to that in the control.",

To evaluate whether Dopimid compounds are P-gp substrates, [(3)H]ritonavir uptake experiments and bi-directional transport studies on confluent MDCKII-MDR1 monolayers were carried out. The brain penetration properties of Dopimid compounds were estimated by the Clark's computational model and evaluated by investigation of their transport across BBMECs monolayers. The dopamine levels following the intraperitoneal administration of the selected Dopimid compounds were measured in vivo by using brain microdialysis in rat.", 
    "29": "Tested compounds were adequately stable in solution buffered at pH 7.4 but undergo faster cleavage in dilute rat serum at 37 degrees C. Receptor binding studies showed that Dopimid compounds are essentially devoid of affinity for dopaminergic and benzodiazepine receptors. [(3)H]ritonavir uptake experiments indicated that selected Dopimid compounds, like L-Dopa and dopamine hydrochloride, are not substrates of P-gp and it was also confirmed by bi-directional transport experiments across MDCKII-MDR1 monolayers. By Clark's model a significant brain penetration was deduced for L-Dopa ethyl ester and dopamine derivatives. Transport studies involving BBMECs monolayers indicated that some of these compounds should be able to cross the BBB. Interestingly, the rank order of apparent permeability (P (app)) values observed in these assays parallels that calculated by the computational approach. Brain microdialysis experiments in rat showed that intraperitoneal acute administration of some Dopimid compounds induced a dose-dependent increase in cortical dopamine output.",

    "39": "The actions of ethanol on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors are still highly controversial issues but it appears that some of its pharmacological effects may depend on receptor subunit composition. Prolonged ethanol exposure produces tolerance and dependence and its withdrawal alters GABA(A) receptor subunit gene expression and function. Whereas benzodiazepines are clinically effective in ameliorating ethanol withdrawal symptoms, work in our laboratory showed that benzodiazepines also prevent, in vitro, some of the ethanol withdrawal-induced molecular and functional changes of the GABA(A) receptors. In the present work, we investigated the effects, on such changes, of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil that can positively modulate alpha(4)-containing receptors. We here report that flumazenil prevented both the ethanol withdrawal-induced up-regulation of the alpha(4)-subunit and the increase in its own modulatory action. In contrast, flumazenil did not inhibit ethanol withdrawal-induced decrease in alpha(1)- and delta-subunit expression as well as the corresponding decrease in the modulatory action on GABA(A) receptor function of both the alpha(1)-selective ligand zaleplon and the delta-containing receptor preferentially acting steroid allopregnanolone. These observations are the first molecular and functional evidence that show a selective inhibition by flumazenil of the up-regulation of alpha(4)-subunit expression elicited by ethanol withdrawal.",

Compared with standard sedation, qualitative physician rating (P < 0.0001) and depth of sedation (P < 0.001) were superior in the ketamine group with shorter recovery times (P < 0.0001). Both patient discomfort and sedation-related technical difficulty were significantly less among patients randomized to receive ketamine (P < 0.0001). More patients in the standard sedation group were crossed-over to the ketamine group due to sedation failure (35.5 vs. 3.7%, P < 0.0001). Nine patients who received ketamine, developed adverse events that were managed conservatively.",

    "45": "The translocator protein (18 kDa; TSPO), previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a high-affinity cholesterol- and drug-binding mitochondrial protein involved in various cell functions including steroidogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation. TSPO is highly expressed in secretory and glandular tissues, especially in steroidogenic cells, and its expression is altered in certain pathological conditions such as cancer and neurological diseases. In this study, we characterized the regulatory elements present in the region of the TPSO promoter extending from 515 to 805 bp upstream of the transcription start site, an area previously identified as being important for transcription. Promoter fragments extending 2.7 kb and 805 bp upstream of the transcription start site were able to direct enhanced green fluorescent protein expression to Leydig cells of the testis, theca cells of the ovary, and cells of the adrenal cortex in transgenic animals. This expression pattern perfectly mimicked endogenous TSPO expression. Functional characterization of the 515-805 bp region revealed the presence of one specificity protein 1/specificity protein 3 (Sp1/Sp3) and two v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue (Ets) binding sites that are important for transcriptional activity in both MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells and NIH/3T3 whole mouse embryo fibroblasts. GA-binding protein alpha (GABPalpha), a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, was found to be associated with the endogenous TSPO promoter. We conclude that Sp1/Sp3 and members of the Ets family of transcription factors bind to specific binding sites in the TSPO promoter to drive basal TSPO gene transcription.",

Safety was evaluated by recording treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, body weight and, when available, laboratory parameters. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were evaluated by a questionnaire based on the UKU scale, and sexual dysfunction by the Psychotropic-Related Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire (PRSexDQ).",

Olanzapine patients showed significantly greater reductions (improvement) from baseline in the PRSexDQ score (p=0.0292) and risperidone patients reported significantly more sexual adverse events (21.1% versus 7.3% for olanzapine; p=0.0018). Mean body weight gain was not significantly different at endpoint (3.5 kg gained with olanzapine versus 1.9 kg gained with risperidone; p=0.3522), but the proportion of patients showing a body weight increase > or =7% was higher among the olanzapine-treated patients (37.8% versus 16.8%; p=0.0012).",

    "50": "The flunitrazepam sensitive-GABA(A) receptor density was increased by cytochalasins C and D at 37 degrees C suggesting that microfilament depolymerization induces exposure to the radioligand of a GABA(A) receptor in synaptosomes (Pharm Biochem Behav 72 (2002) 497). Similarly, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (1-5 microM), but not a mixture of phospholipids, induced an increase of GABA(A) receptors in synaptosomes. Furthermore, N-ethyl maleimide, an inactivator of the sensitive fusion protein, which interacts with GABA(A) receptor, abolished the receptor increase induced by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Together, the results suggest that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, acts via microfilament depolymerization increasing the binding of the radioligand to receptors possibly by modulation of their interaction with proteins involved in trafficking and docking mechanisms.",

Seven days after intrastriatal injection of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), a PET scan was performed using (11)C-PK11195 or (11)C-DPA-713.

    "55": "A close correlation between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow was documented (activation-flow coupling). The matter of an activity-related effect on autoregulation remains elusive. We modulated cortical activity by GABAergic inhibition in 10 pre-anestesized rats and compared effects on activation-flow coupling and autoregulation. Contralateral forepaw stimulation was used to assess activation-flow coupling. Somatosensory potentials as well as local flow velocity responses were recorded with surface electrodes and laser-Doppler flowmetry. Performing intermittent carotid compression we calculated from the laser-Doppler data the transient hyperemic response ratio as a parameter of dynamic cerebral autoregulation. Recovery of cerebral perfusion at the end of the compression phase served as an index of static autoregulation. Tests were performed at baseline and after four successive doses of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg), applied at 30 min intervals. Reversibility of the changes was evaluated by application of flumazenil (0.2 mg/kg). Resting flow velocity levels (162+/-52 vs. 110+/-62 U; p<0.001), evoked potentials (N2-P1-amplitude; 13+/-4 vs.6+/-3 microV; p< 0.005), and resultant flow velocity responses (28+/-12 vs. 4+/-3%; p< 0.0001) decreased after the first dose of midazolam and then remained stable. A dose-dependent decrease was found for the transient hyperemic response ratio (28+/-13 to 22+/-14 to 15+/-10 (p<0.05) to 9+/-5% (p<0.025)) but not static autoregulation. After antagonism, all changes were reversible. Dynamic but not static cerebral autoregulation depends from neuronal activity and thus metabolic demand of neurons.", 
    "56": "In the present work, we studied the effects of piplartine (PIP), an amide alkaloid isolated from the roots of Piper tuberculatum (Piperaceae), in the elevated plus maze, open field, rota rod, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, and forced swimming tests, in mice (Swiss, male, 25 g) to assess anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant and antidepressant effects, respectively. Results showed that PIP (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.), similarly to diazepam, significantly increased not only the number of entrances (100% and 66%, respectively) but also the time of permanence in the open arms (104% and 199%, respectively), indicating that PIP presents an anxiolytic activity. Both effects were completely blocked by the previous administration of flumazenil what suggests the involvement of benzodiazepine type receptors. In the open field test, although PIP did not alter the number of crossings, it significantly increased grooming (103% and 119%) and rearing (60% and 23%), at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg respectively, as compared to controls. However, in the rota rod test, PIP was devoid of effect. Although in the PTZ-induced convulsion test, PIP did not alter the latency time for the onset of the first convulsion, as compared to controls, it significantly reduced in 58% and 60%, respectively, the animal's latency time to death. Furthermore, a significant and dose-dependent decrease in the immobility time, as evaluated by the forced swimming test, was observed after PIP administration (41% and 75% decrease, at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively), suggesting an antidepressant effect, similarly to that observed with imipramine, a classical antidepressant drug used as standard. In conclusion, we showed that PIP presents significant anxiolytic and antidepressant activities, making this drug potentially useful in anxiety and depression.",

Two parallel processes have been carried out, one in mesophilic range (37 degrees C) and the other in thermophilic range (55 degrees C). The influence of temperature and sludge retention time (SRT) has been analysed. Among the substances considered, the higher removal efficiencies were achieved for the antibiotics, natural oestrogens, musks and Naproxen. For the other compounds, the values ranged between 20% and 60%, except for Carbamazepine, which showed no elimination. The removal of oestrogens, Diazepam and Diclofenac occurred after sludge adaptation. In general, no influence of SRT and temperature on PPCPs removal was observed. Considering the difficulty of obtaining reliable PPCPs concentrations, especially those corresponding to the fractions sorbed onto sludge, a methodology to validate the experimental data has been developed and successfully applied.", 
    "58": "It is well known that status epilepticus (SE) becomes increasingly difficult to control over time. Previous studies have indicated that the electroencephalographic pattern at the time of intervention is predictive of the probability of successful treatment. However, these findings are based on studies limited to the first 2h of SE onset. Little data is available on the efficacy of treating SE at later time points.", 
    "59": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of diazepam (DZP) treatment given at two different phases of SE in a lithium-pilocarpine rat model: during continuous ictal discharges (CIDs, phase 3), and during late periodic epileptiform discharges (late PEDs, phase 5). Changes in cortical and hippocampal electroencephalographs (EEGs) were observed continuously during the phases of SE, as well as at 24, 36, 48, and 72h after SE onset. The effects of DZP treatment during CIDs or during late PEDs were compared to control DZP-untreated rats.", 
    "60": "In all three groups, hippocampal and cortical EEGs displayed five distinct phases of SE. There were no statistical differences in the duration of phases 1 and 2 among the three groups. Although DZP administration during CIDs did not terminate CIDs in most rats, it did significantly shorten the duration of phases 3 and 4 of SE. Importantly, DZP given during phase 5 successfully ended behavioral and electrographic seizures in most rats.", 
    "61": "Hippocampal and cortical EEGs displayed five distinct phases of SE that were similarly responsive to DZP treatment. Termination of electrographic seizures with DZP treatment was more effective in the last phase of SE (late PEDs) than in phase 3 (CIDs). These findings suggest that previous reports of DZPs decrease in efficacy over time may not be applicable to DZP treatment at 4h-post onset.", 
    "62": "Benzodiazepines are substances susceptible of producing drug dependence in addition to tolerability to sedative effects and frequent interactions when associated with other drugs. Thus, use of long half life benzodiazepines and inadequate intermediate and short half life dosage is related with falls and fractures in elderly patients. A retrospective study was conducted on the official prescriptions made during 2000-2003 and the daily dose defined per thousand patients/day (DDD/I) was used as a measurement of drug consumption. Prescription of benzodiazepines that are eliminated by oxidative metabolism should be revaluated and modified by other of conjunctive metabolism when treating elderly patients to decrease adverse reactions such as excess sedation, risk of falls and associated fractures.", 
    "63": "Delusional parasitosis (DP) is a rare psychiatric disorder, predominantly observed in middle aged and elderly patients. It can manifest itself as an isolated delusional disorder (primary DP), as a symptom of another psychiatric disorder or as an organic or toxic psychosis. The typical antipsychotic pimozide was traditionally considered to be the gold standard for treating DP. Compared with pimozide, atypical antipsychotics have many advantages in terms of tolerability, but their effectiveness has only been shown in a few case reports, which do not differentiate between primary and other forms of DP. We present the case of a 77-year-old woman with primary DP who responded markedly to the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg daily). She was treated in a psychiatric outpatient department with a follow-up period of 3.5 years. This is the first report of a successful olanzapine mono-therapy in primary DP in such a setting and the longest follow-up period ever reported. The need for maintenance treatment was demonstrated. Olanzapine in age-adapted doses should be considered as an alternative treatment. This paper also provides a review of all published cases in which primary DP was treated with atypical antipsychotics.",

Data derived from naturalistic practice following the launch of IM olanzapine may be helpful for clinicians in assessing efficacy and safety of IM olanzapine. The PANSS-EC scale used in the clinical studies may represent a tool that could be used in routine clinical practice.", 
    "65": "We report on an early unselected case series of 7 patients who received IM olanzapine in routine clinical practice settings in the UK. In this case series, olanzapine IM was generally effective, and no adverse events were reported. Adjunctive benzodiazepines were given concomitantly in 1 of the 7 subjects. This is relevant as concomitant benzodiazepines are not recommended for a minimum of 1 hour post IM olanzapine administration. PANSS-EC data was collected in 2 of the 7 subjects.",

    "73": "A constellation of pharmacologic treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been developed over the past five decades, although each has a number of potential drawbacks in clinical practice. This review addresses one potentially new pharmacologic treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, the gamma-aminobutyric acid analogue pregabalin. We review the mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of pregabalin as well as the results of 5 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of pregabalin in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Based entirely on data from these industry-sponsored (Pfizer), multi-site clinical trials in patients with GAD, pregabalin appears to be generally well tolerated and has rapid onset of action (approximately 1 week), comparable efficacy to benzodiazepines and lower discontinuation rates compared with other pharmacologic treatments. Thus in GAD, a disorder that is often suboptimally responsive to traditional psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic interventions - secondary to poor efficacy, tolerability, and/or side-effects - pregabalin may have a primary role in GAD patients, especially in those with certain psychiatric comorbidities or individuals who are on multi-drug regimens for medical comorbidities.", 
    "74": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common, typically persistent, and disabling condition that is often not recognised, or treated in an evidence-based manner. Current pharmacological and psychological treatment approaches have a number of drawbacks, including a delay in onset of clinical effect, varying relative efficacy against psychological or somatic symptoms of anxiety, potentially troublesome adverse effects, and discontinuation symptoms on stopping treatment. Pregabalin is a structural analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) but is thought to exert its anxiolytic effects through binding in a state-dependent manner to the alpha-2-delta sub-unit of voltage-gated calcium channels in \"over-excited\" pre-synaptic neurones, reducing release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and substance P. At fixed doses of 200 mg/day or greater, it has consistent proven efficacy in acute treatment of DSM-IV-defined GAD, with some evidence of an early onset of clinical effect, and of efficacy across psychological and somatic anxiety symptom clusters. A pregabalin dosage of 450 mg/day is efficacious in the prevention of relapse. There is at present no published direct comparison with an SSRI. The current known adverse effect profile and studies in healthy volunteers together suggest that pregabalin may have some tolerability advantages over benzodiazepines and venlafaxine, at least in short-term treatment.",

    "79": "Although in situ hybridization studies have revealed the presence of kainate receptor (KAR) mRNA in neurons of the rat medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), the functional presence and roles of these receptors are only beginning to be examined. To address this deficiency, whole cell voltage clamp recordings of locally evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were made from mEC layer II and III neurons in combined entorhinal cortex-hippocampal brain slices. Three types of neurons were identified by their electroresponsive membrane properties, locations, and morphologies: stellate-like \"Sag\" neurons in layer II (S), pyramidal-like \"No Sag\" neurons in layer III (NS), and \"Intermediate Sag\" neurons with varied morphologies and locations (IS). Non-NMDA EPSCs in these neurons were composed of two components, and the slow decay component in NS neurons had larger amplitudes and contributed more to the combined EPSC than did those observed in S and IS neurons. This slow component was mediated by KARs and was characterized by its resistance to either 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466, 100 microM) or 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[lsqb]f[rsqb]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX, 1 microM), relatively slow decay kinetics, and sensitivity to 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10-50 microM). KAR-mediated EPSCs in pyramidal-like NS neurons contributed significantly more to the combined non-NMDA EPSC than did those from S and IS neurons. Layer III neurons of the mEC are selectively susceptible to degeneration in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and animal models of TLE such as kainate-induced status epilepticus. Characterizing differences in the complement of postsynaptic receptors expressed in injury prone versus injury resistant mEC neurons represents an important step toward understanding the vulnerability of layer III neurons seen in TLE.", 
    "80": "Our purpose in this study was to determine if the use of an instrument developed by our group to direct sedation choice improves patient satisfaction with endoscopy sedation compared to standard sedation practice. After 200 enrollments, data were available for 194 patients who completed the study. There were nine cases of dissatisfaction: five (5%) in the control group and four (4%) in the intervention group (P = 0.78). The 95% confidence intervals (1%-10%) were almost identical, indicating no difference between groups. The study was stopped after an interim analysis showed no significant difference in satisfaction between the groups. This could have been because the assumption that patients with increased risk of dissatisfaction do better with deeper sedation is incorrect. Another explanation could be the increased awareness of the value of benzodiazepines in endoscopy. Consistent with our findings, nervousness rather than pain predicted dissatisfaction, and the optimal use of anxiolytics with amnesic properties may be comparable to that of propofol.",

Moreover, racemization reduces the administrated dosage concentration as optically active enantiomer converted into its inactive counter part. Therefore, the study of racemization of such type of drugs is an important and urgent need of today. This article describes in vitro and in vivo racemization of optically active drugs. The racemization process of various optically active drugs has been discussed considering the effect of different variables i.e. pH, temperature, concentration of the drug, ionic concentration, etc. Attempts have also been made to discuss the mechanisms of racemization. Besides, efforts have been made to suggest the safe dosages of such type of drugs too.",

Patients with visually significant cataracts were screened for study inclusion by using the following criteria: good general health, good dilation, moderate cataracts, cooperation with in-office tests and procedures, and understanding of cataract surgery. Oral sedation was provided by lorazepam, and an anesthetist was available to manage any medical adverse events. Topical anesthesia was achieved by means of tetracaine drops, lidocaine hydrochloride jelly, and intracameral lidocaine hydrochloride, as necessary. Main outcome measures were heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, intraoperative complications, and medical adverse events necessitating anesthetist intervention.",

    "93": "Classical benzodiazepines (BZs) exert anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsive, and amnesic effects through potentiation of neurotransmission at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3) or alpha(5) subunits. Genetic studies suggest that modulation at the alpha(1) subunit contributes to much of the adverse effects of BZs, most notably sedation, ataxia, and amnesia. Hence, BZ site ligands functionally inactive at GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha(1) subunit are considered to be promising leads for novel, anxioselective anxiolytics devoid of sedative properties. In pursuing this approach, we used two-electrode voltage clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant GABA(A) receptor subtypes to investigate functional selectivity of three newly synthesized BZ site ligands and also compared their in vivo behavioral profiles. The compounds were functionally selective for alpha(2)-, alpha(3)-, and alpha(5)-containing subtypes of GABA(A) receptors (SH-053-S-CH3 and SH-053-S-CH3-2'F) or essentially selective for alpha(5) subtypes (SH-053-R-CH3). Possible influences on behavioral measures were tested in the elevated plus maze, spontaneous locomotor activity, and rotarod test, which are considered primarily predictive of the anxiolytic, sedative, and ataxic influence of BZs, respectively. The results confirmed the substantially diminished ataxic potential of BZ site agonists devoid of alpha(1) subunit-mediated effects, with preserved anti-anxiety effects at 30 mg/kg of SH-053-S-CH3 and SH-053-S-CH3-2'F. However, all three ligands, dosed at 30 mg/kg, decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, suggesting that sedation may be partly dependent on activity mediated by alpha(5)-containing GABA(A) receptors. Hence, it could be of importance to avoid substantial agonist activity at alpha(5) receptors by candidate anxioselective anxiolytics, if clinical sedation is to be avoided.",

We investigated the effects of cranberry juice on R-S-warfarin, tizanidine, and midazolam; probes of CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4. Ten healthy volunteers took 200 ml cranberry juice or water t.i.d. for 10 days. On day 5, they ingested 10 mg racemic R-S-warfarin, 1 mg tizanidine, and 0.5 mg midazolam, with juice or water, followed by monitoring of drug concentrations and thromboplastin time. Cranberry juice did not increase the peak plasma concentration or area under concentration-time curve (AUC) of the probe drugs or their metabolites, but slightly decreased (7%; P=0.051) the AUC of S-warfarin. Cranberry juice did not change the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Daily ingestion of cranberry juice does not inhibit the activities of CYP2C9, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4. A pharmacokinetic mechanism for the cranberry juice-warfarin interaction seems unlikely.", 
    "95": "To develop and validate an in vivo cocktail method for high-throughput phenotyping of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, 12 healthy subjects received five probe drugs alone or simultaneously. The in vivo phenotyping index of CYP2C9, the ratio of 8 h urine concentration of losartan to its metabolite after a single administration of losartan, was not significantly different from that obtained using the five-drug cocktail. Similarly, the ratios of [omeprazole]/[5-hydroxyomeprazole] (CYP2C19) and [paraxanthine]/[caffeine] (CYP1A2) in 4 h plasma samples and the log ratio of [dextromethorphan]/[dextrorphan] (CYP2D6) in 8 h urine samples and the 4 h plasma concentrations of midazolam (CYP3A) after single administration or well-established three-drug cocktail of caffeine, omeprazole, and dextromethorphan were not significantly different from those after the new five-drug cocktail. In conclusion, the new five-drug cocktail regimen, named the \"Inje cocktail,\" can be used as a tool to phenotype in vivo enzyme activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A with only 4 h blood sampling and 8 h urine collection following simultaneous administration of the five probe drugs.",

    "100": "We developed novel methods for analyzing the concentration-response curve of an agonist to estimate the product of observed affinity and intrinsic efficacy, expressed relative to that of a standard agonist. This parameter, termed intrinsic relative activity (RA(i)), is most applicable for the analysis of responses at G protein-coupled receptors. RA(i) is equivalent to the potency ratios that agonists would exhibit in a hypothetical, highly sensitive assay in which all agonists behave as full agonists, even those with little intrinsic efficacy. We investigated muscarinic responses at the M(2) receptor, including stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis through G(alpha15) in HEK 293T cells, inhibition of cAMP accumulation through G(i) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and stimulation of cAMP accumulation through G(s) in CHO cells treated with pertussis toxin. The RA(i) values of carbachol, oxotremorine-M, and the enantiomers of aceclidine were approximately the same in the three assay systems. In contrast, the activity of 4-[[N-[3-chlorophenyl]carbamoy]oxy-2-butynyl]trimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343) was approximately 10-fold greater at M(2) receptors coupled to G(alpha15) in HEK 293T cells compared with M(2) receptors coupled to G(i) in the same cells or in CHO cells. Our results show that the RA(i) estimate is a useful measure for quantifying agonist activity across different assay systems and for detecting agonist directed signaling.", 
    "101": "Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine have high affinity for multiple monoamine neurotransmitter receptors and are the mainstay of pharmacological therapy for treatment of schizophrenia. In addition to blocking monoamine receptors, these drugs also affect intracellular signaling cascades. We now report that 24-h treatment with 300 nM olanzapine causes desensitization of serotonin (5-HT)(2A) receptors in A1A1v cells, a rat cortical cell line, as indicated by a reduction in inositol phosphate accumulation following stimulation with a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist (-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-lodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl. Olanzapine treatment for 24 h increased the levels of 5-HT(2A) receptors in both cytosol (234 +/- 34% of control level) and membrane fractions (206 +/- 14% of control levels) and RGS7 proteins in both cytosol (193 +/- 32% of control levels) and membrane fractions (160 +/- 18% of control levels) as measured on Western blots. Increased phosphorylation of Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 2 and increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 with 24-h olanzapine treatment demonstrate activation of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade. Pretreatment with a JAK inhibitor, AG490 [alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide], prevented the olanzapine-induced increase in membrane RGS7 protein levels; AG490 alone had no effect on RGS7 protein levels. We verified that treatment with AG490 reduced phosphorylation of JAK2 and inhibited the nuclear localization of phospho-STAT3. Interestingly, treatment with the JAK inhibitor had no effect on 5-HT(2A) receptor protein levels. These data suggest that olanzapine-induced activation of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade causes increased expression of RGS7 protein, which in turn could mediate desensitization of 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling caused by olanzapine because RGS7 binds to Galpha(q) protein and accelerates GTP hydrolysis.", 
    "102": "The CYP3A family is a major drug metabolism enzyme in humans. Metabolism-based inhibition of CYP3A might cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To assess the risk of DDIs caused by metabolism-based inhibition (MBI) of CYP3A, we established an automated single time- and concentration-dependent inhibition assay. To create a diagram to assess DDI risk of compounds in the early discovery stage, we classified 171 marketed drugs by the possibility of the occurrence of in vivo DDI caused by MBI from the relationship between the inactivation activity determined in the MBI screening, the therapeutic blood or plasma concentration, and the in vivo DDI information. This analysis revealed that the DDI risk depends on both the MBI potential and the blood concentration of a compound, and provided the criteria of the DDI risk. In the assay, three compounds (midazolam, nifedipine, and testosterone) were compared as CYP3A probe substrates. The results show that the evaluation for MBI does not depend on the probe substrates used in the assay. In addition, we established an automated assay to distinguish quasi-irreversible and irreversible binding to CYP3A in which the quasi-irreversible inhibitors such as diltiazem, verapamil, and nicardipine were dissociated from CYP3A by the addition of potassium ferricyanide, whereas the irreversible inhibitors such as clozapine, delavirdine, and mibefradil were not. It provides useful information related to chemical structures likely to cause MBI. By using these MBI assays supported by an extensive database of marketed compounds, a systematic MBI evaluation paradigm was established and has been incorporated into our drug discovery process.",

This study, therefore, compared the behavioral response of experienced versus na\u00efve adult black tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) in the MPCT, with/without diazepam administrations. Subjects were tested in the figure-8 maze and confronted with a taxidermized wild-cat predator stimulus.

Confrontation with the predator induced significant behavioral changes; i.e., proximic avoidance and tsik-tsik alarm call. Diazepam administration, concomitant to predator exposure, reversed the behavioral changes observed. In both the experienced and na\u00efve marmosets a similar behavioral profile and response pattern to diazepam was detected, corroborating the important selective pressure that felines seem to have on marmoset behavioral ecology. Therefore, during a more naturalistic-like regimen--i.e., recurring intermittent predator encounters--the general response pattern remains highly consistent, regardless of prior experience. One may consider the re-use of marmoset subjects in the MPCT, particularly under these specific conditions (i.e. repeated 20-min confrontations, 72-h apart).",

Furthermore, the influence of extracellular calcium was analyzed, through functional and radioligand binding assays. The rank order of potency for selective muscarinic antagonists for M(1), M(2), and M(3) receptor subtypes, measured from affinity (pA(2)) values, was p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (pFHHSiD) (M(3)) > pirenzepine (M(1)) > methoctramine (M(2)), indicating a predominance of M(3) subtype. This order was unchanged with age. Contractions by muscarinic agonist methacholine (MCh) were diminished in aged rats, resulting in lower apparent affinity (pD(2)) values, compared with adult controls. A larger decrease of MCh contractions occurred in aged rats after Ca(2+) withdrawal or after the calcium channel blocker isradipine. Changes were not detected for relaxation by adrenergic agonists. In conclusion, aging caused a decrease of MCh potency, which is probably related to the reduction of calcium sensitivity in jejunum.",

Four additional devices, Oralstat (American Bio Medica); SmartClip (Envitec); Impact (LifePoint); and OraLine IV s.a.t (Sun Biomedical Laboratories), were recently evaluated for their ability to meet the claimed (and proposed) cutoff concentrations set by the manufacturers for the detection of amphetamine(s), cocaine/metabolite, opiates, and cannabinoids (Oralstat also benzodiazepines). With the exception of the Sun Biomedical device, actual false-positive results were not encountered. Most devices performed well for the detection of opiates and amphetamine(s), but approximately half had amphetamine(s) cutoff concentrations greater than that proposed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Only three devices had cocaine cutoffs less than or equal to 20 ng/mL (SAMHSA), and a number of false-negative results were obtained. The devices still were not capable of detecting Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol at 4 ng/mL (SAMHSA). However, sensitivities improved since the initial studies, and approximately half of the devices met the THC-COOH cutoff proposed by SAMHSA. Results from the current and previous evaluations are presented in the paper and indicate that the sensitivity and performance of commercial OF drug testing devices is improving, but remains problematic for the reliable detection of cannabinoid use.",

Results have been confounded by concomitant improvements in positive, depressive, and extrapyramidal symptoms. This 12-week, double-blind, controlled study aimed to examine the effects of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine versus haloperidol on persistent, primary negative symptoms and neurocognitive functions in stable schizophrenic patients with the deficit syndrome and low levels of concomitant positive, depressive, and extrapyramidal symptoms.",

Quantification of the drugs internal exposure increase upon administration with an inhibitor requires understanding to avoid the drug reaching toxic thresholds. In this study, we aim to predict the effect of the CYP3A4 inhibitors, itraconazole (ITZ) and its primary metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole (OH-ITZ) on the pharmacokinetics of the anesthetic, midazolam (MDZ) and its metabolites, 1' hydroxymidazolam (1OH-MDZ) and 1' hydroxymidazolam glucuronide (1OH-MDZ-Glu) using mechanistic whole body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic simulation models. The model is build on MDZ, 1OH-MDZ and 1OH-MDZ-Glu plasma concentration time data experimentally determined in 19 CYP3A5 genotyped adult male individuals, who received MDZ intravenously in a basal state. The model is then used to predict MDZ, 1OH-MDZ and 1OH-MDZ-Glu concentrations in an CYP3A-inhibited state following ITZ administration.",

In vivo Km and Vmax optimized values for MDZ hydroxylation were similar to literature based in vitro measures. With the addition of the ITZ/OH-ITZ model to each individual coupled MDZ + metabolite model, the plasma concentration time curves were predicted to greatly increase the exposure of MDZ as well as to both increase exposure and significantly alter the plasma concentration time curves of the MDZ metabolites in comparison to the basal state curves. As compared to the observed clinical data, the inhibited state curves were generally well described although the simulated concentrations tended to exceed the experimental data between approximately 6 to 12 hours following MDZ administration. This deviations appeared to be greater in the CYP3A5 *1/*1 and CYP3A5 *1/*3 group than in the CYP3A5 *3/*3 group and was potentially the result of assuming that ITZ/OH-ITZ inhibits both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, whereas in vitro inhibition is due to CYP3A4.",

Sleepiness is rarely well recognised as a causing factor of traffic accidents. 2.5% up to 20% people suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep deprivation as its most frequent cause. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and medical problems--especially sleep disturbances. The sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) has been identified as the most common cause of habitual drowsy driving. Patients with SAS (apart from other health problems) are 6 times more likely to have accidents. After adequate treatment of severe SAS with continuous positive airway pressure the risk of accident lowered 5 x. Other important sleep disturbances include chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement in sleep. Sleepiness was described in Parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy, in chronic cardiacs and in people with complex internal health problems. Regular or single intake of drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others) can itself induce sleep problems. Sleepiness in persons without sleep disorder may occur due to preventable causes such as poor sleep habits which lead to sleep deprivation.",

We examined whether D1- and/or GBR-mediated increases in progestin-facilitated lordosis of female hamsters and rats involve the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase A (PKA), in the VTA. In experiment 1, ovariectomized hamsters, primed with estradiol (E2; 10 microg at h 0) + progesterone (P; 100 microg at h 45), were first pre-tested for lordosis and motor behavior (h 48) and then infused with the PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMP (100 ng/side), or vehicle. Thirty minutes later, hamsters were retested and then received infusions of the D1 agonist, SKF38393 (100 ng/side), the GBR agonist, muscimol (100 ng/side), or vehicle to the VTA. Hamsters were post-tested for lordosis and motor behavior 30 min later. In Experiment 2, ovariectomized rats, primed with E2 (10 microg at h 0), were first pre-tested for lordosis and then infused with Rp-cAMP (100 ng/side) or vehicle to the VTA at h 44. Immediately after testing, rats received infusions of SKF38393 (100 ng/side), muscimol (100 ng/side), or vehicle and were retested for lordosis. Rats were then infused with the neurosteroid, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP; 100 or 200 ng/side), or beta-cyclodextrin vehicle and were post-tested for lordosis and motor behavior 10 and 60 min later. The enhancing effects of progestins or progestins plus D1 or GBR activation on lordosis of E2-primed hamsters and rats were blocked by the PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMP.

However, GLE significantly decreased sleep latency, increased sleeping time, non-REM sleep time and light sleep time in pentobarbital-treated rats. Suppression of locomotor activity in normal mice induced by GLE was also observed. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg showed a significant antagonistic effect on the shortening in sleep latency, increase in sleeping time, non-REM sleep time or light sleep time in pentobarbital-treated rat induced by GLE.

Bone markers indicated a significantly higher bone formation in tofisopam (+8.6%) and a lower in fluoxetine (-56.1%) compared to placebo. These data suggest deleterious effects for SSRIs, both on trabecular and cortical bone and a positive effect of PDE inhibitors on trabecular bone. Furthermore tofisopam anabolic effect in terms of bone markers, suggests a potential therapeutic effect of the PDE inhibitors on bone.",

Using this technique, a total of 59 DEG mRNA fragments were observed in the testes treated with DBP 750 mg/kg/day compared to vehicle control. Of these 59 genes, 31 genes were significantly altered after exposing rats to high dose DBP (750 mg/kg/day), and their sequences cloned. Based on the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), 4 expressed sequence tags (EST), 27 cloned genes (Insl3, pgrp, H1SHR, etc.) and 3 genes (LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; Spag4, sperm associated antigen 4 and PBR, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor) were found to be involved in spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis. In addition, the expression patterns of the steroidogenesis-related genes such as scavenger receptor class B-1 (SR-B1), steroidogenic acute regulated protein (StAR), P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc), CYP17, and CYP19 were further analyzed by RT-PCR. Significant increases in the mRNA levels of steroidogenesis-related genes (PBR, SR-B1, StAR, P450scc, and CYP17) were observed in the high dose DBP-treated rats. However, DBP significantly decreased the CYP19 mRNA levels compared with controls. DBP (750 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the TR-alpha1 and PPARgamma expression in testes, whereas the AR and ERbeta protein levels were significantly reduced in the same group. These data indicate that the steroidogenesis- or spermatogenesis-related genes identified in this study may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental pollutants-mediated male infertility.",

    "160": "Small human hepatocytes (SH) were grown in a rotary cell culture system, and their potential to metabolize alcohol and the benzodiazepines oxazepam and diazepam was evaluated. Control experiments were performed with SV40-immortalized HEP cells and cell respective drug-free media.", 
    "161": "Our results show that SH in rotary culture are able to metabolize ethanol in reasonable amounts compared with evaporation controls (p<0.01). Moreover, SH are also able to metabolize oxazepam and diazepam which proves their ability to perform conjugation and the presence of functional cytochrome P450 enzymes. Basic metabolic activities such as glucose consumption, albumin and urea production are not significantly influenced by the drugs used, which is a precondition for clinical use of these cells. Significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase release indicates enhanced cell death in cultures of SH incubated with either ethanol (p<0.05) or diazepam (p<0.005), but stable viability at or above 90% suggests that cell proliferation is able to keep up with drug-induced cell death.",

Moreover, in the isoflurane group, the left ventricular contractility index was higher and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) decreased in comparison with pre-operative values. Post-operatively, the cardiac index (CI) and the cardiac function index (CFI) increased in all groups (P < 0.05).

    "170": "The application of analytical techniques in postmortem toxicology is often more difficult than in other forms of forensic toxicology owing to the variable and often degraded nature of the specimens and the diverse range of specimens available for analysis. Consequently, analysts must ensure that all methods are fully validated for the particular postmortem specimen(s) used. Collection of specimens must be standardized to minimize site-to-site variability and should if available include a peripheral blood sample and at least one other specimen. Urine and vitreous humor are good specimens to complement blood. In some circumstances solid tissues such as liver are recommended as well as gastric contents. Substance-screening techniques are the most important element since they will determine the range of substances that were targeted in the investigation and provide initial indication of the possible role of substances in the death. While immunoassay techniques are still commonly used for the most common drugs-of-abuse, chromatographic screening methods are required for general unknown testing. These are still predominately gas chromatography (GC) based using nitrogen/phosphorous detection and/or mass spectrometry (MS) detection, although some laboratories are now using time-of-flight MS or liquid chromatography (LC)-MS(MS) to cover a sometimes more limited range of substances. It is recommended that laboratories include a second chromatographic method to provide coverage of acidic and other substances not readily covered by a GC-based screen when extracts do not include all physiochemical types. This may include a gradient high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) photodiode array method, or better LC-MS(MS). Substance-specific techniques (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates) providing a second form of identification (confirmation) are now divided between GC-MS(MS) and LC-MS(MS) procedures. LC-MS(MS) has taken over from many methods for the more polar compounds previously used in HPLC or in GC methods requiring derivatization. Analysts using LC-MS will need to obtain clean extracts to avoid poor and variable sensitivity caused by background suppression of the signal. Isolation techniques in postmortem toxicology tend to favor liquid extraction; however solid-phase extraction and solid-phase microextraction methods are available for many analytes.", 
    "171": "This paper reviews multi-analyte single-stage and tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) procedures using different mass analyzers (quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight) for screening, identification, and/or quantification of drugs, poisons, and/or their metabolites in blood, plasma, serum, or urine published after 2004. Basic information about the biosample assayed, work-up, LC column, mobile phase, ionization type, mass spectral detection mode, and validation data of each procedure is summarized in tables. The following analytes are covered: drugs of abuse, analgesics, opioids, sedative-hypnotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants including selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), herbal phenalkylamines (ephedrines), oral antidiabetics, antiarrhythmics and other cardiovascular drugs, antiretroviral drugs, toxic alkaloids, quaternary ammonium drugs and herbicides, and dialkylphosphate pesticides. The pros and cons of the reviewed procedures are critically discussed, particularly, the need for studies on matrix effects, selectivity, analyte stability, and the use of stable-isotope labeled internal standards instead of unlabeled therapeutic drugs. In conclusion, LC-MS will probably become a gold standard for detection of very low concentrations particularly in alternative matrices and for quantification in clinical and forensic toxicology. However, some drawbacks still need to be addressed and finally overcome.", 
    "172": "Benzodiazepines are drugs known to produce tolerance and dependence and also to be abused and co-abused. The aim of this study was to further explore the mechanisms that underlie adaptive changes in GABA(A) receptors following prolonged exposure to these drugs. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells stably expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2s GABA(A) receptors were exposed for 72 h to a high concentration of diazepam (50 microM) in the absence or presence of other drugs. Radioligand binding studies were used to determine the parameters of [(3)H]flunitrazepam and [(3)H]muscimol binding sites and allosteric interactions between these sites. Prolonged treatment with diazepam increased the maximum number (B (max)) of [(3)H]flunitrazepam and [(3)H]muscimol binding sites in the membranes, and of [(3)H]muscimol binding sites on the surface of HEK 293 cells. There was no change in the affinity (K (d)) of binding sites. The diazepam-induced increase in the B (max) value of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding sites was reduced by two GABA(A) receptor antagonists, gabazine (1 and 10 microM) and picrotoxin (100 microM). In addition, it was reduced by cycloheximide (5 microg/ml), a protein synthesis inhibitor, and actinomycin D (7.5 microg/ml), an RNA synthesis inhibitor. Flumazenil (5 microM), the antagonist of benzodiazepine binding sites, also up-regulated [(3)H]flunitrazepam recognition sites. Simultaneous treatment with diazepam and flumazenil failed to produce an additive up-regulation. GABA (1 nM - 1 mM)-induced potentiation of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to membranes obtained from diazepam (50 microM)-pretreated cells was markedly reduced, suggesting functional uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites. The results suggest that diazepam up-regulated benzodiazepine binding sites on stably expressed GABA(A) receptors by stimulating their synthesis at both the transcriptional and translational levels. A comparable increase of [(3)H]muscimol binding sites expressed on the surface of intact HEK 293 cells suggests that internalisation of surface receptors presumably can not explain the uncoupling.", 
    "173": "The cholinergic innervation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a pivotal role in regulating executive functions. Muscarinic receptors activated by acetylcholine depolarize pyramidal neurons in the rodent PFC homologue, but the mechanisms mediating this modulation are controversial. To address this question, we studied the responses of layer V rat pre- and infralimbic cortex pyramidal neurons to muscarinic receptor stimulation. Consistent with previous findings, M(1) receptor stimulation produced a strong depolarization, leading to tonic firing. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed that M(1) activation reduced constitutively active inwardly rectifying (Kir2) K(+) channel currents. Blocking protein kinase C activation or depleting intracellular Ca(2+) stores did not affect the modulation. However, reversal of the modulation was prevented by the phosphoinositide kinase inhibitor, wortmanin, suggesting the modulation was mediated by depletions of membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Reduction of Kir2 channel currents by M(1) receptor stimulation significantly increased the temporal summation of excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by repetitive stimulation of layer I. This action was complimented by M(2/4) receptor mediated presynaptic inhibition of the same terminals. As a consequence of this dual modulation, the responses to a single, isolated afferent volley was reduced, but the response to a high-frequency afferent burst was potentiated.",

One hundred and twenty patients with tremor and generalized anxiety disorder were investigated. Tremor was scored clinically by the Webster Tremor Scale. Electromyographic examination of tremor activity from antagonistic hand muscles was performed. Sixty patients were treated with alprazolam and propranolol, in an open, crossover design, while the other sixty patients received no particular treatment for the tremor The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with propranolol, alprazolam, or received no tremor treatment. Our results revealed a postural and kinetic tremor with characteristics of an enhanced physiological tremor. Tremor involved only upper limbs and no other body parts. Treatment with propranolol or alprazolam had similar favorable effect on tremor. In conclusion tremor in generalized anxiety disorder is an enhanced physiological tremor The kinetic tremor disturbs patients and particular tremor treatment with propranolol or alprazolam should be applied.",

    "185": "Deep sedation controlled by the staff of gastrointestinal endoscopy units is currently controversial. In the last few years, numerous studies have provided data supporting the safety of propofol use in these techniques. We present a large series of patients who underwent gastroscopy or colonoscopy under endoscopist-controlled deep sedation. A total of 875 procedures (297 gastroscopies and 578 colonoscopies) were included. In all procedures intravenous propofol with or without intravenous midazolam was administered. In gastroscopies, complications attributable to the sedation were found in only 6.7% of the patients, mostly due to desaturation, which was resolved without the need for intubation. In colonoscopies, complications were found in 11.2%, the most frequent being bradycardia and desaturation, none of which were serious. No association was found between the presence of complications and the propofol dose administered. In the group of patients undergoing colonoscopy, simultaneous midazolam administration allowed reduction of the propofol dose required to achieve deep sedation. In conclusion, propofol shows a good safety profile and excellent tolerance in patients undergoing gastroscopy and colonoscopy and can be administrated by the endoscopy team. At least in the case of colonoscopy, the associated use of midazolam allows the propofol dose to be decreased, thus, theoretically, reducing the drug's adverse effects.",

In society, methadone deaths represent an important issue of public safety: methadone diversion to and ingestion by nontolerant individuals outside of treatment. Within treatment, methadone deaths occur most commonly in the early stabilization period (due to issue of tolerance), in periods of transition, or among certain individuals who abuse other substances (opioids, benzodiazepines, or alcohol). Research suggests moderately high methadone dosages help improve patient retention. Results from pharmacodynamic, kinetic and stereospecific studies continue to support the importance of individualizing dose. For some patients, much larger doses may be necessary to fully achieve all pharmacotherapy goals of treatment.

    "201": "AIn this work, the authors have analysed the principal studies on the interest in the use of benzodiazepines in schizophrenia. The first double-controlled study concerning this question was conducted in 1961. The results of the first studies are criticisable due to the variability of the diagnostic and clinical assessment criteria, as well as to the divergences between the different conclusions. Through this review of literature, the authors wish to clarify the questions and hypothesis raised specify certain therapeutic strategies. MECHANISM OF GABA-ERGIC TREATMENTS: The analysis of the principle works on this question provides evidence on the use of benzodiazepines in schizophrenia. By fixing on their receptors, benzodiazepines facilitate GABA-ergic transmission. GABA is an inhibitor neurotransmitter. The GABA stimulation induced by benzodiazepines may be at the origin of a reduction of the pre-synaptic release of dopamine in the mesolimbic region. The GABA stimulation may also delay the post-synaptic adaptation of the dopaminergic neurons to neuroleptics. This phenomenon may enhance the activity of neuroleptics in resistant schizophrenia. Benzodiazepines would also have an effect on the mesoprefrontocortical regions where neuroleptics may be less efficient. It is interesting to note that this cerebral region is particularly sensitive to stress. This effect of benzodiazepines on the mesoprefrontocortical region might explain a preferentially beneficial effect in patients who have radiographic signs consistent with prefroncortical atrophy, although this observation remains preliminary. BENZODIAZEPINES IN MONOTHERAPY: In monotherapy their action on productive and deficient psychotic symptoms is greatly discussed and not very convincing. The main studies in the use of benzodiazepines alone ) are heterogeneous for their diagnosis criteria, their methodology and their results. The conclusions of the publications are not totally clear, and different points are to be criticized: heterogeneity of assessment criteria, heterogeneity and variability of methodology, use of non standardized scales, most of the studies are open studies, variability of benzodiazepines dose. BENZODIAZEPINES IN ASSOCIATION WITH NEUROLEPTICS: In few controlled studies, most authors have underlined ) the advantage of the association of benzodiazepines with neuroleptics. This association may act either on positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) or on negative symptoms. The latent period and the length of the effect of benzodiazepines in the treatment of psychotic patients remain unclear. According to certain studies, the therapeutic effect may appear in a short time, and then disappear within the fourth week. The association of benzodiazepines with neuroleptics is particularly helpful for patients with great anxiety, whether they have neuroleptic intolerance or not. There is no robust convergence about the type of benzodiazepines and their optimal dose in the treatment of schizophrenia. Their use may permit a reduction in the neuroleptic dose. They could increase the plasma concentration of neuroleptics and they might act on the mesoprefrontocortical regions where there are fewer dopaminergic auto receptors. BENZODIAZEPINES AND ANXIETY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: States of anxiety, and in particular panic disorders that would participate in the exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, would benefit from the use of benzodiazepines. Anxiety can be considered as a major symptom of schizophrenia: insecure feelings and impressions of threatening events are frequent during schizophrenia. Interpretations or brutal hallucinations can lead to the feeling of imminent catastrophe or anxiety. Nevertheless, anxious phenomenons are under-estimated for many reasons: on the one hand, positive symptoms may hide anxiety, and on the other, the symptoms that are observed in patients treated with neuroleptics are often attributed to the neuroleptic side effects rather than linked to anxiety. Benzodiazepines and catatonia - Lorazepam has demonstrated its efficacy on catatonia. This effect seems to be specific of small doses of lorazepam (<5 mg/day). It should be compared to the effect of zolpidem in the same conditions. This prescription should be limited to acute catatonia, with no effect on chronic catatonia. Benzodiazepines and neuroleptic side effects - The use of benzodiazepines to treat some side effects of neuroleptics such as akathesia is reported by certain authors but remains little explained. They may have no effect or only small effects on tardive dyskinesia, but could reduce their incidence with the use of the smallest doses of neuroleptics in association with benzodiazepines. Safety of use - The safety of use of benzodiazepines in schizophrenia, particularly in association with neuroleptics is admitted, however recommended precautions with clozapine are to be noted. Benzodiazepine combined with clozapine clearly increases the frequency of cardiovascular and respiratory accidents. Some studies point out the risk of behavioural desinhibition and dysphoria. Their use should also be limited to patients with good compliancy, in order to avoid exacerbation of symptoms in the case of brutal interruption of the treatment. Dependency, which is an important issue in the use of benzodiazepines, seems much lesser in schizophrenia than in personality disorders and anxiety. Conversely, some studies point out the benefits of benzodiazepine use in schizophrenia, with their efficacy in the treatment and prevention of drug abuse. Finally, benzodiazepines contribute to the establishment of a good patient-doctor relationship, and may guarantee enhanced treatment compliancy.",

    "203": "In this study, we investigated the effects of antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine and haloperidol, on the density of the muscarinic M2 receptors in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and hypoglossal nucleus (HN). Female Sprague Dawley rats were treated with olanzapine, haloperidol or vehicle (control) for 1 (short-term) or 12 weeks (long-term). Quantitative autoradiography was used to investigate the M2 receptor density in the DVC and HN using a muscarinic antagonist [(3)H] AF-DX384. Olanzapine, but not haloperidol, treatment induced a significant decrease in the binding density of M2 receptors in the DVC compared to control groups. Although the HN showed a higher density of [(3)H] AF-DX384 binding than the DVC, treatment with both olanzapine and haloperidol did not induce any significant changes in [(3)H] AF-DX384 binding in the HN. These results suggest that olanzapine-induced body weight gain may be associated with functional changes in the muscarinic neurotransmission in the DVC."
