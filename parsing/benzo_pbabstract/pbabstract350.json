Ninety patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided into three groups of 30 each; patients without preanesthetic medication (group N), patients who received 0.1 mg.kg-1 of diazepam (group D) and 5 micrograms.kg-1 of clonidine (group C) as a preanesthetic medication. Ninety minutes before the induction of anesthesia, we applied a lidocaine tape to each patient. The grade of pain at the pinprick test and at the venous puncture was evaluated in the operating room. No significant difference of the pain score was seen between the groups. We concluded that the effect of lidocaine tape was not influenced by the preanesthetic medication.", 
    "1": "We have reported that the Japanese herbal medicine \"Saiko-Keishi-To\" (SK) which is often used for treating epileptic patients activates the GABAA receptor-mediated chloride current (Icl). In the present study, we examined whether the SK-induced Icl could be potentiated by several intravenous anesthetics known to interact with the GABAA receptor, and also examined whether SK could potentiate the GABA-induced Icl. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from cultured rat dorsal root ganglion cells. The peak amplitude of the Icl evoked by SK (2 mg.ml-1) increased after pentobarbital (50 microM) to 184 +/- 26% (n = 5), diazepam (1 microM) to 166 +/- 29% (n = 5), and propofol (5 microM) to 294 +/- 93% (n = 5) from their respective controls, while the anesthetics did not activate the Icl by themselves. The peak amplitude of the Icl evoked by GABA (10 microM) increased after propofol (5 microM) to 617 +/- 189% of the control (n = 4), but decreased to 84 +/- 7% of the control by SK (0.2 mg.ml-1, n = 4). These results indicate that the SK-induced Icl can be potentiated by the intravenous anesthetics, positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor-Cl- channel complex and that SK is not a positive allosteric modulator, but a partial agonist for the GABAA receptor. Our study thus suggests that the combined use of SK and anticonvulsants such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines may be more effective in treating epileptic patients than SK alone.", 
    "2": "Although ketamine elevates cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) with an increase in cerebral blood flow, sedatives such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates and opioids have been reported to inhibit it. In this study, we evaluated the changes in epidural pressure (EP) as a good index for CSFP during total intravenous anesthesia with propofol-fentanyl-ketamine (PFK) compared to isofluranenitrous oxide anesthesia (GOI). Twelve patients for gastrectomy were allocated to two groups: PFK (n = 6) and GOI group (n = 6). In PFK group, epidural pressure did not increase during the anesthesia, and was significantly lower than in GOI group (30 and 180 min after induction of anesthesia, and 0, 30 and 60 min after stopping anesthetic administration). The present data suggest that PFK may safely be used for patients with intracranial hypertension.", 
    "3": "Midazolam is widely used in anesthesia. This paper shows characteristics of midazolam and how to use midazolam in clinical anesthesia. As a premedication, midazolam should be injected i. m. 15 min before entering an operating room in a dose of 0.04 mg.kg-1 to 0.08 mg.kg-1 according to the patient's age. For anesthesia induction, midazolam should be used together with barbiturate or propofol to take advantage of synergistic effects. Continuous infusion of midazolam in total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl results in hemodynamic stability and good postoperative analgesia. During spinal or epidural anesthesia, i.v. midazolam of 0.05 mg.kg-1 has anti-anxietic and sedative effects. Midazolam inhibits awakening during cardiopulmonary bypass and it has little cardiodepressant effect. In aged, hepatic damaged or renal damaged patients, the effects of midazolam are slightly increased. Therefore, lower doses may be required in such patients. In conclusion, midazolam is usable in premedication, induction, maintenance in general anesthesia and in sedation in local anesthesia.",

Nineteen percent of the Ume\u00e5-hospitalized drivers (UHDs), 26% of the Ume\u00e5 fatally injured drivers (UFDs), and 21% of the Gothenburg fatally injured drivers (GFDs) tested positive for drugs and/or alcohol. Ten percent of the UHDs, 8% of the UFDs, and 6% of the GFDs tested positive for drugs. Almost 5% of the UHDs, had illicit drugs, and 6% had licit drugs. Only 3% of the GFDs and none of the UFDs had illicit drugs. Benzodiazepines, followed by opiates, tetrahydrocannabinol, and amphetamine were the most common drugs detected. Twelve percent of the UHDs, 24% of the UFDs, and 17% of the GFDs tested positive for alcohol. Two percent of the UHDs, 6% of the UFDs, and 2% of the GFDs had a combination of drugs and alcohol.",

The history and physical examination and a few tests usually suffice to diagnose this disorder, which is treatable with behavioral therapy, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines.", 
    "6": "Agitation, psychotic features, and depression are common behavioral complications seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Agitation tends to be common and persistent in these patients, while psychotic features are less common and moderately persistent over time. Depressed mood with vegetative signs is uncommon and usually does not persist. The limited data available from controlled trials suggest that neuroleptics should be the first choice for the treatment of psychotic features and agitation. Anticonvulsants like valproate and benzodiazepines can be used to treat agitation in the absence of psychotic features. Trazodone and zolpidem are effective hypnotics, and buspirone may treat anxiety. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first choice for persistent depressed mood. Low doses of psychotropic medication are indicated, particularly for neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Specific target symptoms and potential side effects should be identified and monitored during treatment. Drug interactions can be a problem, and the use of multiple psychotropic medications is discouraged because of the potential for neurologic toxicity. To avoid long-term side effects and unnecessary treatment for symptoms that may be transient, periodic attempts should be made to taper or discontinue the psychotropic medication.", 
    "7": "The ontogenetic development of postingestive inhibitory control of ingestion by an oil preload was examined in preweaning rats. Gastric preloads (5% b.wt) of water, mineral oil or corn oil were administered 5 min before a 30-min intake test in which pups licked milk from the floor of a test chamber. Preloads of corn oil decreased intake significantly compared with preloads of mineral oil or water on Postnatal Days 15 and 18, but not on Postnatal Day 12. Because preloads of corn oil reduced intake ore than preloads of mineral oil, it is possible that the inhibitory effect of corn oil is due to its fats rather than to its oily texture. Cholecystokinin (CCK), presumably released from the small intestine, apparently mediates part of this inhibitory effect because pretreatment with devazepide, a specific CKKA antagonist, significantly reduced the inhibition produced by corn oil.", 
    "8": "Intracellular recording techniques were used to examine GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus in the post-self sustaining limbic status epilepticus model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Orthodromically evoked, monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in vitro following pharmacological blockade of ionotropic glutamate and GABA(B) receptors. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials from epileptic tissue were kinetically altered relative to controls; both the 10-90% rise-time and width (measured at half-maximum amplitude) were reduced by approximately 50% resulting in significant shortening of duration. The degree of pyramidal cell hyperexcitability, assessed before pharmacological treatment as the number of action potentials evoked by maximum intensity afferent stimulation, correlated significantly with the magnitude of synaptic potential duration reduction determined following blockade of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Bath application of the benzodiazepine type 1 receptor agonist zolpidem reduced post-self sustaining limbic status epilepticus CA1 pyramidal cell hyperexcitability substantially (but not completely) via a marked increase in inhibitory postsynaptic potential area. Post-self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus inhibitory postsynaptic potentials which exhibited the most pronounced shortening were augmented by zolpidem to a greater degree than longer duration synaptic potentials. In contrast, zolpidem-induced augmentation of control inhibitor, postsynaptic potential area was much less robust. It is suggested that a deficiency in post-self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition contributes to a state of partial disinhibition which is a major factor in enhanced CA1 excitability in chronic limbic epilepsy. Possible mechanisms underlying post-self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus kinetic abnormalities are discussed.", 
    "9": "Stimulant-induced exocytosis has been demonstrated in sympathetic ganglia of the rat by in vitro incubation of excised ganglia in the presence of tannic acid, which stabilizes vesicle cores after their exocytotic release. Sites of exocytosis were observed along non-synaptic regions of the surfaces of neuron somata and dendrites, including regions of dendrosomatic and dendrodendritic apposition, as well as along the surfaces of nerve terminals About half the exocytoses associated with nerve terminals were parasynaptic or synaptic, and these appeared mostly to arise from the presynaptic terminal, but occasionally from the postsynaptic element. The results demonstrated that the neurons of sympathetic ganglia release materials intraganglionically in response to stimulation, that release from different parts of the neuron is subject to independent regulation, at least via cholinergic receptors, and that release is partly diffuse, potentially mediating autocrine or paracrine effects, and partly targeted toward other neurons, but that the latter mode is not necessarily, and not evidently, synaptic. Specifically, exocytosis from all locations increased significantly during incubation in modified Krebs' solution containing 56 nm potassium. Observation of the effects of cholinergic agonists (nicotine, carbachol, oxotremorine) and antagonists (atropine, AF-DX 116) showed that nicotinic and muscarinic excitation each, independently, increased the incidence of exocytosis from somata and dendrites. Exocytosis from nerve endings was not altered by nicotine, but was enhanced or, at high initial rates of exocytosis, decreased, by muscarinic stimulation. Evidence was obtained for muscarinic auto-inhibition of exocytosis from nerve terminals, occurring under basal incubation conditions, and for a muscarinic excitatory component of somatic exocytosis, elicitable by endogenous acetylcholine. The M2-selective muscarinic antagonist AF-DX 116 was found to modify the exocytotic response of the dendrites to oxotremorine, widening the range of its variation; this effect is consistent with recent evidence for the presence of M2-like muscarinic binding sites, in addition to M1-like binding, upon these dendrites [Ramcharan E. J. and Matthews M. R. (1996) Neuroscience 71, 797-832]. Over all conditions, disproportionately more sites of somatic and dendritic exocytosis were found to be located in regions of dendrosomatic and dendrodendritic apposition than would be expected from the relative extent of the neuronal surface occupied by these relationships. Such mechanisms of intraganglionic release may be expected to contribute to the regulation and integration of the behaviour of the various functionally distinctive populations of neurons in these ganglia, by autocrine, paracrine, and focal, neuroneuronal, routes of action. Similar phenomena of exocytotic soma-dendritic release might prove to subserve integrative neuroneuronal interactions more widely throughout the nervous system.", 
    "10": "We report the case of a 59-year-old man with primary intestinal T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who developed abnormal facial twitching synchronous with small palatal movements induced by attempts at speaking or swallowing. At rest, the electromyogram (EMG) showed no spontaneous muscular activity. Phonation triggered trains of synchronous, rhythmic EMG bursts at a frequency of 3-4 Hz lasting 10-20 s, with an average burst of 150 ms, which simultaneously involved palatal, facial, and neck muscles bilaterally with left-sided predominance. An enhanced blink reflex recovery curve was observed after stimulation of either side. Backaveraging electroencephalographic study revealed no activity that was time locked with the jerks. Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed an increased signal intensity and bilateral enlargement of the inferior olives. No antineuronal-specific antibodies were found in the blood or in the cerebrospinal fluid. All of these clinical findings were consistent with a symptomatic palatal tremor (PT). Because it was triggered by activation of cranial muscles, we termed this movement disorder action PT. To our knowledge, this is the first report of symptomatic PT displaying these features.", 
    "11": "Two experiments investigated long-term verbal memory performance in groups of 20-year-old heavy (HSDs) and light social drinkers (LSDs), in the presence and absence of a pharmacological challenge (lorazepam 2 mg). In Experiment 1 (n = 13), a verbal learning task was presented visually and it was found that lorazepam significantly impaired delayed verbal recall performance in both groups. Experiment 2 (n = 14) assessed the effect of presenting the verbal learning task in the auditory compared to the visual modality. Both groups' performance on the delayed trials of the visually presented task was reduced in the lorazepam treatment. However, in the auditory presented task, lorazepam reduced 30-min delayed recall performance in the HSDs but not in the LSDs. The differential effect of lorazepam on HSDs compared to LSDs on delayed recall performance when material is presented in the auditory modality may suggest that frequent heavy social drinking results in changes in CNS functioning.", 
    "12": "Using statistical parametric mapping and 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET we have previously shown reduction of central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR) binding restricted to the hippocampus in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS). The limited spatial resolution of PET, however, results in partial-volume averaging that affects quantitative analysis of cBZR density.", 
    "13": "We determined hippocampal volume loss and reduction in cBZR binding using an MRI-based method for partial-volume effect correction of 11C-FMZ volume of distribution (FMZ-Vd) in 17 patients with refractory mTLE and an MRI diagnosis of HS that was subsequently histologically verified in all cases. Quantitative neuropathology was performed with assessment of neuron density in 14 of the 17 patients. Absolute FMZ-Vd and asymmetry indices (FMZ-AI) were compared before and after partial-volume effect correction with MRI-determined hippocampal volumes (HCV), hippocampal T2 measurements, and, if available, neuronal cell densities.", 
    "14": "Compared with 15 age-matched healthy volunteers, significant reductions of absolute hippocampal FMZ-Vd were found before correction for partial-volume effects in 11 of 17 patients (65%) and only abnormal FMZ-AI in the other six patients. After partial-volume effects correction all 17 patients (100%) showed both significant unilateral reduction of absolute FMZ-Vd and abnormal FMZ-AI. There was no correlation between corrected absolute FMZ-Vd and HCV or neuronal cell density. After correction for partial-volume effect we found a mean 38% reduction of FMZ-Vd in the sclerosed hippocampus, over and above the reduction of HCV.", 
    "15": "Correction for partial-volume effect allows absolute quantitation of FMZ-PET and increases its sensitivity for detecting abnormalities in TLE due to HS. The lack of correlation between cBZR binding and neuronal density implies that atrophy with neuron loss is not the sole determinant of reduced cBZR binding in patients with mTLE and hippocampal sclerosis.",

The five most frequently prescribed drugs by the expert stratum were carbamazepine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), trazodone, amantadine, and beta-blockers. In comparison, the nonexperts most often reported prescribing carbamazepine, beta-blockers, haloperidol, TCAs, and benzodiazepines. Desyrel (p = .06) and amantadine (p = .001) were significantly more likely to be chosen by experts than by nonexperts. Experts chose haloperidol significantly less often than nonexperts (p = .01). Prescription of sedating drugs such as haloperidol or benzodiazepines was not found to be associated with the acuity of injury of TBI patients in the respondent's practice, practice setting, or years of practice since completing residency. Choice of haloperidol to treat agitation was not significantly associated with the degree to which explosive anger, verbal aggression, or physical aggression were considered important to the respondent's definition of agitation.",

    "21": "A fatality due to ingestion of the antidepressant drug moclobemide is reported. Moclobemide is a selective and reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type A. Previous reports have suggested that it is a safe drug even when taken in large quantities. The few reported fatalities have all been ascribed to serotonin syndrome, due to an interaction between moclobemide and other serotonergic agents. A 48-year-old woman with a history of depression and suicide attempts was found deceased at home. Autopsy revealed no evidence of significant natural disease or injury. Toxicologic analysis was performed and drug levels measured by capillary gas chromatography. The blood concentration of moclobemide was 137 mg/L and the liver concentration was 432 mg/kg. Low levels of diazepam, nordiazepam, and trifluoperazine were also detected. Death was considered to be due to acute poisoning by moclobemide. This case report is the first, to our knowledge, where death has been attributed to the toxic effects of moclobemide alone.", 
    "22": "We have investigated the effects of midazolam and diazepam on intracellular calcium (Ca2+) handling in foetal mouse ventricular myocytes using the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent indicator, indo-1. We also investigated separately whether flumazenil or the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K8644, antagonized these myocardial depressive effects. Midazolam and diazepam decreased the Ca2+ transient and beating rate in a concentration-dependent manner, and these decreases were prevented by Bay K8644. Flumazenil did not antagonize the myocardial depressive effects. In myocytes whose sarcoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by ryanodine, midazolam and diazepam had the same potent cardiodepressive effects. Midazolam and diazepam are direct cardiac depressants, which decrease the Ca2+ transient and beating rate, and the L-type Ca2+ channel is important in the negative inotropism and chronotropism caused by these drugs.",

History, signalment, abnormalities on physical and neurologic examinations, results of diagnostic testing, and diagnosis were recorded for each dog. Results were divided into the following 3 categories on the basis of the cause of the tremors: inflammatory, noninflammatory, and idiopathic. Cause was determined by results of CSF analyses or a history of toxin exposure.",

The compounds of the ester series displayed low affinity for both receptor types. Conversely, most of N,N-dialkyl(2-phenylimidazo[1,2-alpha]pyridin-3-yl)acetamides 7e-t proved to possess high affinity and selectivity for CBR or PBR depending on the nature of substituents at C(6)- and/or C(8) on the heterocyclic ring system. In particular, the 6-substituted compounds 7f-n displayed ratios of IC50 values (IC50(CBR)/IC50(PBR)) ranging from 0.32 (7m) to 232 (7k), while the 6,8-disubstituted compounds 7o-t were more than 1000-fold more selective for PBR versus CBR. Compounds 7f,m were examined in several different benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. Expression of specific GABAA, receptor subunit assemblies in Xenopus oocytes was utilized to evaluate functionally both the efficacy and potency of the positive modulation of GABA-evoked Cl- currents by 7f and 7m in comparison with Zolpidem. The rank order of potencies of these drugs was 7f (EC50 = 3.2 x 10(-8) M) > Zolpidem (EC50 = 3.6 x 10(-8) M) > 7m (EC50 = 2.2 x 10(-7) M). The actions of these compounds were also tested on alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2s, receptors. However, the EC50 of these compounds was increased, compared to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s receptors, by 30-, 4-, and 5-fold for 7m, 7f, and Zolpidem, respectively. Finally, these compounds were almost completely devoid of activity at receptors containing the alpha 5 subunit.",

Side effects may include nausea, headache, dizziness and arthralgia. Naltrexone appears to exert its effect by decreasing the craving for alcohol. It has also been useful in allowing some patients to decrease their need for other medications, such as benzodiazepines and antihypertensives. Naltrexone should be used as an adjunct to a comprehensive alcohol treatment program that addresses concomitant medical problems and psychosocial concerns.", 
    "35": "Exploration models of anxiety rely almost universally on the use of laboratory species. Furthermore, the spontaneous patterns of locomotion displayed are often interpreted as being an expression of antipredator defense. However, there is no direct link between the experience of these animals and the proposed motivation for their behaviour. To address this problem, the behaviour of wild trapped voles (Microtus socialis), a small-rodent species that is heavily predated upon, was examined in the elevated plus-maze and the black/white exploration model. It was hypothesised that the patterns of locomotion in these exploration models of anxiety should be similar to those reported for laboratory animals if the reactions of the laboratory animals are related to antipredator defense. Data revealed that voles show a similar preference for the protected areas in these models (closed arms or dark section) and that this preference can be modified by buspirone and diazepam. Interestingly, although the effective doses of each drug was the same within each model, it differed between models, with the minimum effective doses of these compounds being lower in the black/white exploration model (1 mg/kg) than in the elevated plus-maze (4 mg/kg). These data provide valuable information concerning the actions of anxiolytic compounds in wild trapped animals as assessed by formal laboratory models and provide useful verification that findings in these models may be generalised to species other than laboratory rodents.", 
    "36": "Rats received a single conditioning session in which unsignaled food pellets were delivered to the food magazine of a training box, followed by a single extinction session without pellet presentations. Groups of rats differed in the drug state induced prior to conditioning and extinction according to a 2 x 2 design using d-amphetamine sulphate (AMP, 0.5 mg/kg, S.C.) and midazolam (MID, 0.1 mg/kg, S.C.). Subsequently, all rats received nonreinforced test sessions under AMP and MID. The dependent measure was the frequency of magazine visits during selected portions of each session. Rats that received extinction in the same drug state as had been present during conditioning did not respond significantly more during the extinction session than rats extinguished in a different drug state. This implies that conditioning was not state dependent. However, during the AMP tests, the rats extinguished under MID responded more under AMP than under MID, whereas the rats extinguished under AMP did not respond differentially during the tests under AMP vs. MID. These results were interpreted as reflecting the joint operation of state-dependent extinction and unconditioned drug effects. As in studies manipulating external contextual stimuli, extinction proved to be more vulnerable to becoming context dependent than conditioning.", 
    "37": "L-Glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and kainate increased the release of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity from primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons incubated in Mg2+(1.2 mM)-containing medium. The neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity released by 100 microM glutamate was mainly accounted for by neuropeptide Y (1-36), but consisted in part (about 20%) of peptide YY. The effect of 100 microM glutamate on neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity release was largely (about 70%) prevented by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (10 microM), while the remainder (about 30%) was sensitive to the AMPA/ kainate receptor antagonist 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline-2-3-dione (10 microM). The AMPA(100 microM)-evoked release of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity was strongly antagonized by 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline-2-3-dione and by 1-aminophenyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine, but it was in part (15-20%) sensitive to dizocilpine. The releases of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity elicited by glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, AMPA and kainate were all strongly Ca(2+)-dependent. Tetrodotoxin (1 microM) abrogated the N-methyl-D-aspartate-evoked release and partly inhibited the release caused by glutamate, but did not modify significantly AMPA- or kainate-evoked release. Removal of Mg2+ from the medium caused increase of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity release, an effect prevented by dizocilpine maleate or 7-Cl-kynurenate. Cyclothiazide (10 microM), a drug known to prevent AMPA receptor desensitization, enhanced the neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity release elicited by 100 microM AMPA, but not that caused by 100 microM kainate. However, when used at a lower concentration (50 microM), kainate elicited a response that was potentiated significantly by cyclothiazide. It is concluded that glutamate can stimulate Ca(2+)-dependent release of neuropeptide Y from hippocampal neurons mainly through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and, less so, by activating cyclothiazide-sensitive receptors of the AMPA-preferring type.",

    "39": "In order to test if a benzodiazepine would enhance or hinder the therapeutic effects of exposure, immediate and delayed effects of alprazolam on flight phobics were assessed by questionnaires and ambulatory physiological recording. Physiological measures included heart rate, skin conductance level and fluctuations, finger temperature, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and various respiratory measures derived from two bands calibrated for each subject. Twenty-eight women with flying phobia flew twice at a 1-week interval. One and a half hours before flight 1, 14 randomly assigned phobics received double-blind 1 mg of alprazolam and 14 received placebo. On flight 1, alprazolam reduced self-reported anxiety (5.0 vs 7.4) and symptoms (5.3 vs 3.6) more than placebo, but induced an increase in heart rate (114 vs 105 bpm) and respiratory rate (22.7 vs 18.3 breaths/min). Before flight 2, the alprazolam group did not expect to be more anxious than the placebo group (6.7 vs 6.5), but in fact indicated more anxiety during flight (8.5 vs 5.6), and a substantial increase in panic attacks from flight 1 to flight 2 (7% vs 71%). Heart rates in the alprazolam group increased further (123 bpm). Results indicate that alprazolam increases physiological activation under acute stress conditions and hinders therapeutic effects of exposure in flying phobia.", 
    "40": "A8947 is a member of the sulfonyl urea class of compounds and is the active ingredient in a commercial broad leaf herbicide. This compound has been shown to produce pancreatic hypertrophy in rats, mice, and dogs. The objectives of this study were to investigate the mechanism(s) for the A8947 induction of pancreatic acinar cell hypertrophy and proliferation and to evaluate whether these pancreatic changes are reversible. A8947 was fed to male Crl:CD BR rats for up to 28 days (0, 300, 10,000, 30,000 ppm) or 56 days (0, 30,000 ppm). Rats were terminated on Test Days 7, 14, and 28 to assess the time course and dose response for the A8947-induced pancreatic changes, while rats terminated on Test Day 56 were used to assesss the reversibility of the pancreas effects at 30,000 ppm A8947. A8947 produced significant increases in pancreatic weight and acinar cell proliferation and diffuse acinar cell hypertrophy in 7 days at 10,000 and 30,000 ppm dose levels. By Day 14, absolute pancreas weights in the 10,000 and 30,000 ppm groups were maximally increased and remained at these levels throughout the study. In contrast, acinar cell proliferation in the 30,000 ppm group was still elevated at Test Day 14, but attenuated relative to the 7-day response, and returned to control levels by Test Day 28. No effects were observed at 300 ppm after a 28-day exposure period, while complete reversibility of A8947-induced pancreatic effects was demonstrated at 30,000 ppm following a 1-month recovery period (Test Day 56). Cholecystokinin (CCK) levels were increased by A8947 and closely followed the time course for pancreatic changes. MK-329, a specific CCKA receptor antagonist, completely ablated the ability of 30,000 ppm A8947 to increase pancreas weight following 7 days of exposure. A8947 did not bind the CCKA receptor in a receptor competition assay, negating any potential agonist mechanism. A8947 did, however, inhibit trypsin in vitro, suggesting a mechanism of action similar to that of raw soy protein, in which trypsin inhibition in vivo results in increased CCK levels followed by pancreatic acinar cell hypertrophy and proliferation.", 
    "41": "1. The muscarinic receptor subtypes mediating contraction of the guinea-pig lung strip and inhibition of the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic vagus nerve endings in the guinea-pig trachea in vitro have previously been characterized as M2-like, i.e. having antagonist affinity profiles that are qualitatively similar but quantitatively dissimilar compared to cardiac M2 receptors. The present study sought to establish definitely the identity of these receptor subtypes by using the selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, tripitramine. Guinea-pig atria and guinea-pig trachea (postjunctional contractile response) were included for reference. 2. It was found that tripitramine antagonized methacholine-induced contractions of the guinea-pig lung strip with pKB value of 8.76 +/- 0.05. Both the parallel shifts of the concentration-response curves and the slope of the Schild plot begin not significantly different from unity (when antagonist preincubation was for 2 h) indicated the involvement of a single population of receptors in the contractile response. From the pKB values obtained with tripitramine and a range of other selective muscarinic receptor antagonists (cf. Roffel et al., 1993), this single population of receptors can only be classified as M2-like. 3. Tripitramine antagonized methacholine-induced chronotropic and inotropic responses in guinea-pig right and left atria with apparent pKB values of 9.4-9.6. However, such values were only obtained when antagonist preincubation was relatively long and/or antagonist concentration relatively high (e.g with 1 h at 100 or 300 nM but 3 h at 30 nM). It thus appears that low concentrations of tripitramine do not readily equilibrate with M2 receptors in guinea-pig atria nor with M2-like receptors in the guinea-pig lung strip. 4. Tripitramine increased electrical field stimulation-induced cholinergic twitch contractions in guinea-pig trachea in concentrations of 0.3-100 nM, by blocking prejunctional muscarinic inhibitory autoreceptors; with higher concentrations, twitch contractions were progressively diminished, as a result of blocking postjunctional M3 receptors (apparent pKB value 6.07 +/- 0.15). The pEC20 value (-log concentration that increases twitch by 20% maximum) was 8.29 +/- 0.08, which would suggest that M4 receptors are involved in this response. 5. Oxotremorine-induced inhibition of the release of prelabelled [3H]-acetylcholine from guinea-pig trachea, under conditions where there is no auto-feedback, was blocked by tripitramine (2 h preincubation) with a pKB value of 8.56 +/- 0.06. The slope of the corresponding Schild plot was not significantly different from unity, which together with the parallel shifts of the concentration-response curves indicated the involvement of a single muscarinic receptor subtype. 6. Since the pKB value for tripitramine at prejunctional receptors in guinea-pig trachea is in between the affinities towards M2 and M4 receptors, correlation plots were constructed to compare the pKB values obtained with tripitramine and a range of other selective muscarinic receptor antagonists (cf. Kilbinger et al., 1995) to reported affinities at M1-M4 receptors. This showed rather similar distribution patterns of the data points around the line of equality in the case of M2 and M4 receptor subtypes. However, the correlation coefficient was markedly better for M2 (0.9667) than for M4 (0.5976). Since recent evidence suggests that M4 receptors are not expressed in cholinergic nerves from guinea-pig trachea, it is concluded that prejunctional muscarinic autoinhibitory receptors in this tissue exhibit an atypical M2 type character, with a pharmacological profile distinct from cardiac M2 receptors.", 
    "42": "1 The so-called enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells constitute 65-75% of the endocrine cells in the acid-producing part of the rat stomach. They produce and secrete histamine and pancreastatin, a chromogranin A (CGA)-derived peptide, in response to gastrin, Cholecystokinin (CCK)B/gastrin receptor blockade is known to suppress their activity. 2 We have examined the time course of the deactivation of the ECL cells following treatment with the selective CCKB receptor antagonists RP73870 and YM022. The drugs were given by continuous subcutaneous infusion for a time span of 1 h to 3 weeks and the serum gastrin concentration and various ECL cell parameters were measured (oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase (HDC) activity, histamine and pancreastatin concentrations, HDC mRNA and CGA mRNA levels, and circulating pancreastatin concentration). 3 The two antagonists caused a prompt and dramatic decline in the oxyntic mucosal HDC activity and HDC mRNA level. The HDC activity started to decline after 1-2 h, was reduced by 60-70% after 6 h and was maximally suppressed (80-90%) after 24-48 h. The HDC mRNA level was reduced after 12 h and was at about 20% of the pretreatment level after 2-4 days of infusion. The ECL cell histamine concentration was lowered by about 50% after 7-10 days. 4 RP73870 and YM022 lowered the serum pancreastatin concentration and the oxyntic mucosal CGA mRNA level. The serum pancreastatin concentration was reduced by 40% after 6 h and the reduction was maximal after 2-3 days. A decline in the oxyntic mucosal CGA mRNA level was noted after 12 h with a maximal reduction after 2-4 days of infusion. The ECL cell pancreastatin concentration was reduced by 30-40% after 3 weeks. 5 The infusion of RP73870 and YM022 induced hypergastrinaemia. The serum gastrin concentration started to rise after 2-4 h, there was a 2 fold increase after 6 h and maximal increase (3-4 fold) after 2-3 days of treatment. 6 In conclusion, CCKB/gastrin receptor blockade promptly deactivates the ECL cells. Deactivation, manifested in a greatly reduced HDC activity, was apparent after 1-2 h of the infusion. The serum pancreastatin concentration and the oxyntic mucosal HDC mRNA and CGA mRNA levels were greatly reduced after 1-2 days. The ECL cell concentrations of histamine and pancreastatin declined quite slowly by comparison.", 
    "43": "This study examined the effects of midazolam on the doses of propofol required for the induction of hypnosis and the maintenance of propofol/nitrous oxide anesthesia. In addition, the effects of midazolam on the time to patient recovery, perioperative mood profiles, incidence of perioperative dreams, patient satisfaction scores, and requirement for postoperative analgesics were assessed. This investigation was a prospective, randomized, and double-blind study of female patients undergoing dilatation and curettage. Patients received midazolam (30 microg/kg, n = 30) or an equal volume of placebo (n = 30) immediately before the induction of anesthesia. Recall of dreams was assessed immediately postoperatively, in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and on the day after surgery using a questionnaire designed for surgical patients. Mood profiles were quantified using the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List-Revised, which was completed preoperatively and 1 h postoperatively. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8, an eight-item self-administered version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, was used to assess patient satisfaction on the day after surgery. Our results indicate that although the time to the loss of the lid reflex was significantly shorter in patients receiving midazolam (43.8 +/- 2.7 vs 74.7 +/- 7.6 s, P < 0.0003), there was no significant difference in the dose of propofol required to induce hypnosis or maintain anesthesia. There were no group differences in postoperative sedation and orientation scores, perioperative mood profiles, incidence of dreams, and patient satisfaction scores. More patients who received midazolam requested analgesics in the PACU (11 vs 4, P < 0.05). In conclusion, midazolam did not reduce the anesthetic dose requirement of propofol in patients undergoing anesthesia with nitrous oxide, nor did it accelerate patient recovery. Our results call into question the benefit of coinducing anesthesia with propofol and midazolam.", 
    "44": "Midazolam, administered immediately before anesthetic induction with propofol, did not decrease the dose of propofol necessary for hypnosis, nor the maintenance of surgical anesthesia, in female patients undergoing diagnostic dilatation and curettage. In addition, midazolam did not alter patient recovery characteristics, postoperative mood, incidence of perioperative dreams, or patient satisfaction. The use of midazolam was associated with an increased need for postoperative analgesics. Our study calls into question the benefit of administering midazolam immediately before anesthetic induction with propofol.", 
    "45": "The central effects of benzodiazepines may be attenuated after chronic use by changes in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics or both. This attenuation may be influenced by the dosing pattern and the characteristics of the user population. The objectives of this study were to evaluate drug sensitivity in long-term users of temazepam and lorazepam in a clinical population.", 
    "46": "The sensitivity to benzodiazepine effects in chronic users (1-20 years) of lorazepam (n = 14) or temazepam (n = 13) was evaluated in comparison with age and sex matched controls. Drug sensitivity was evaluated by plasma concentration in relation to saccadic eye movement parameters, postural stability and visual analogue scales.", 
    "47": "Pharmacokinetics of lorazepam and temazepam did not differ between patients and control subjects. Chronic users of lorazepam showed clear evidence of reduced sensitivity, indicated by lack of any pharmacodynamic difference between patients and controls at baseline, when drug concentrations were similar to the peak values attained in the control subjects after administration of 1-2.5 mg of lorazepam. In addition, there was a two- to four fold reduction in the slopes of concentration-effect plots for measures of saccadic eye movements and body sway (all; P < or = 0.01). By contrast, sensitivity in chronic users of temazepam was not different from controls. The difference between the temazepam and the lorazepam group appears to be associated with a more continuous drug exposure in the latter, due to the longer half-life and a more frequent intake of lorazepam. This pattern of use may be partly related to the more anxious personality traits that were observed in the chronic users of lorazepam.", 
    "48": "Chronic users of lorazepam show evidence of tolerance to sedative effects in comparison with healthy controls. Tolerance does not occur in chronic users of temazepam. The difference may be related to pharmacological properties, in addition to different patterns of use, associated with psychological factors.", 
    "49": "Fast synaptic inhibition in the forebrain is mediated primarily by GABA acting on GABAA receptors (GABARs). GABARs are regulated by numerous positive (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and neurosteroids) and negative (picrotoxin, bicuculline, and Zn2+) allosteric modulators. The sensitivity of GABARs to GABA and to allosteric modulators changes gradually during normal development, during development of chronic epilepsy, and after prolonged exposure to GABAR agonists. Here we report the development of rapid functional plasticity of GABARs occurring over 45 min of continuous seizures (status epilepticus) in rats. Seizures induced in rats by administration of lithium followed by pilocarpine were readily terminated by the benzodiazepine diazepam when administered early during the seizures (after 10 min of seizures). However, during status epilepticus, there was a substantial reduction of diazepam potency for termination of the seizures. To determine whether the loss of sensitivity of the animals to diazepam was caused by an alteration of GABAR functional properties, we obtained whole-cell GABAR currents from hippocampal dentate granule cells isolated acutely from control rats and from rats undergoing status epilepticus. GABAR properties were characterized by determining GABA sensitivity and the sensitivity of GABARs to regulation by benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and Zn2+. When compared with those from naive controls, GABAR currents from rats undergoing status epilepticus were less sensitive to diazepam and Zn2+ but retained their sensitivity to GABA and pentobarbital. We conclude that the prolonged seizures of status epilepticus rapidly altered the functional properties of hippocampal dentate granule cell GABARs.", 
    "50": "Experimental lesions and quantitative autoradiography were used to investigate the cellular distribution of neurotransmitter receptors in rats. Lesions were produced by intracortical injections of either volkensin or ricin. However, only the former is retrogradely transported and volkensin treatment causes significant loss of contralateral cortical pyramidal neurones. Binding of [3H]pirenzepine (muscarinic M1 receptors) and [3H]nicotine was reduced in contralateral cortex in volkensin compared with ricin and/or control (uninjected) animals. However, binding of [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(n-dipropylamino)tetralin (5-HT1A receptors), [3H]ketanserin (5-HT2A receptors), and [3H]1,3-dipropylcyclopentylxanthine (adenosine A1 receptors) was unchanged. The most likely explanation for these results is that M1 and nicotinic receptors are present in large numbers on those pyramidal neurones that are lost. The results are discussed in terms of the biology of cortical pyramidal neurones, drugs for Alzheimer's disease, and novel ligands for improving human brain scanning techniques.", 
    "51": "Leptin is a circulating protein involved in the long-term regulation of food intake and body weight. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released postprandially and elicits satiety signals. We investigated the interaction between leptin and CCK-8 in the short-term regulation of food intake induced by 24-hr fasting in lean mice. Leptin, injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at low doses (4-120 microg/kg), which did not influence feeding behavior for the first 3 hr postinjection, decreased food intake dose dependently by 47-83% during the first hour when coinjected with a subthreshold dose of CCK. Such an interaction was not observed between leptin and bombesin. The food-reducing effect of leptin injected with CCK was not associated with alterations in gastric emptying or locomotor behavior. Leptin-CCK action was blocked by systemic capsaicin at a dose inducing functional ablation of sensory afferent fibers and by devazepide, a CCK-A receptor antagonist but not by the CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260. The decrease in food intake which occurs 5 hr after i.p. injection of leptin alone was also blunted by devazepide. Coinjection of leptin and CCK enhanced the number of Fos-positive cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus by 60%, whereas leptin or CCK alone did not modify Fos expression. These results indicate the existence of a functional synergistic interaction between leptin and CCK leading to early suppression of food intake which involves CCK-A receptors and capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibers.", 
    "52": "Requirements for the provision of an efficient and reliable service for drugs of abuse screening in urine have been summarized in Part I of this review. The requirements included rapid turn-around times, good communications between requesting clinicians and the laboratory, and participation in quality assessment schemes. In addition, the need for checking/confirmation of positive results obtained for preliminary screening methods was stressed. This aspect of the service has assumed even greater importance with widespread use of dip-stick technology and the increasing number of reasons for which drug screening is performed. Many of these additional uses of drug screening have possible serious legal implications, for example, screening school pupils, professional footballers, parents involved in child custody cases, persons applying for renewal of a driving licence after disqualification for a drug-related offence, doctors seeking re-registration after removal for drug abuse, and checking for compliance with terms of probation orders; as well as pre-employment screening and work-place testing. In many cases these requests will be received from a general practitioner or drug clinic with no indication of the reason for which testing has been requested. This also raises the serious problems of a chain of custody, provision of two samples, stability of samples, and secure and lengthy storage of samples in the laboratory-samples may be requested by legal authorities several months after the initial testing. The need for confirmation of positive results is now widely accepted but it may be equally important to confirm unexpected negative results. Failure to detect the presence of maintenance drugs may lead to the patient being discharged from a drug treatment clinic and, if attendance at the clinic is one of the terms of continued employment, to dismissal. It seems likely that increasing abuse of drugs and the efforts of regulatory authorities to control this, will lead to the manufacture of more designer drugs. Production of substituted phenethylamines was facilitated by the drug makers' cook book, 'PIHKAL' (Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved) by Dr Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin, and production of substituted tryptamines is promised in their next book, TIHKAL. Looking to the future, laboratories will need to ensure that they can detect and quantitate an ever-increasing number of drugs and related substances. The question of confidence in results of drugs of abuse testing raised in 1993 by Watson has assumed even greater importance as a result of attention focused on the OJ Simpson trial in Los Angeles. Toxicological investigations are likely to be challenged more frequently in the future. Even if analyses have been performed by GC-MS, there is a need to establish the level of match between the spectrum of the unknown substance and a library spectrum which is considered acceptable for legal purposes. It will also be essential to ensure that computer libraries contain spectra for all substances likely to be encountered in drugs of abuse screening.", 
    "53": "The authors analyzed the incidence of sexual dysfunction (SD) with different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) and hence the qualitative and quantitative changes in SD throughout time in a prospective and multicenter study. Outpatients (192 women and 152 men; age = 39.6 +/- 11.4 years) under treatment with SSRIs were interviewed with an SD questionnaire designed for this purpose by the authors and that included questions about the following: decreased libido, delayed orgasm or anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, inability to ejaculate, impotence, and general sexual satisfaction. Patients with the following criteria were included: normal sexual function before SSRI intake, exclusive treatment with SSRIs or treatment associated with benzodiazepines, previous heterosexual or self-erotic current sexual practices. Excluded were patients with previous sexual dysfunction, association of SSRIs with neuroleptics, recent hormone intake, and significant medical illnesses. There was a significant increase in the incidence of SD when physicians asked the patients direct questions (58%) versus when SD was spontaneously reported (14%). There were some significant differences among different SSRIs: paroxetine provoked more delay of orgasm or ejaculation and more impotence than fluvoxamine, fluoxetine and sertraline (chi 2, p < .05). Only 24.5% of the patients had a good tolerance of their sexual dysfunction. Twelve male patients who suffered from premature ejaculation before the treatment preferred to maintain delayed ejaculation, and their sexual satisfaction, and that of their partners, clearly improved. Sexual dysfunction was positively correlated with dose. Patients experienced substantial improvement in sexual function when the dose was diminished or the drug was withdrawn. Men showed more incidence of sexual dysfunction than women, but women's sexual dysfunction was more intense than men's. In only 5.8% of patients, the dysfunction disappeared completely within 6 months, but 81.4% showed no improvement at all by the end of this period. Twelve of 15 patients experienced total improvement when the treatment was changed to moclobemide (450-600 mg/day), and 3 of 5 patients improved when treatment was changed to amineptine (200 mg/day).", 
    "54": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of malaria infection on benzodiazepine binding in rat brain. Young male Wistar rats were infected with the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei, while age-matched control rats (n = 5) received normal saline intraperitoneally. Parasitemia was determined in blood of infected animals. Animals were killed after two weeks, and synaptosomal brain membrane homogenate was prepared from cerebral cortex. Membrane homogenate was incubated in duplicate with 3H-flunitrazepam (0.2-10 nM in buffer, pH 7.4) and binding parameters determined. The number of receptors (Bmax) was decreased marginally but significantly (P = 0.047) in malaria-infected (MI) rats (MI rats: 1.12 +/- 0.1 pmol.mg-1 protein; control rats: 1.42 +/- 0.08 pmol.mg-1 protein) while binding affinity (Kd) was not altered (MI rats: 1.18 +/- 0.3 nM; control rats: 1.02 +/- 0.15 nM).

    "59": "A 15-month-old girl underwent several emergency department (ED) visits and two admissions for parent-reported histories of ingestions, apnea, and seizures. She was initially admitted following reports of several unusual episodes of syncope accompanied by convulsive movements and was discharged on mephobarbital with a diagnosis of atypical seizure disorder. The day after discharge, she was brought to the ED in cardiopulmonary arrest and was resuscitated after a prolonged period. She was declared brain dead 2 days later. Ante- and postmortem toxicology produced several inconclusive findings, none of which explained death. Autopsy findings, including neuropathology, failed to demonstrate any significant disease processes. Approximately 3 months later, a 4-month-old female sibling was brought to the ED with a parent-reported history of apnea and seizures similar to the deceased child. A stool specimen obtained 2 days after admission contained numerous tiny seeds, which were found by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to contain lorazepam and temazepam. The role of these benzodiazepines in the apnea episodes in this infant was unknown, but the presence of the seeds in such a young infant coupled with the parent's aberrant behavior, led to the tentative diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This diagnosis was strengthened when results from these studies persuaded legal authorities to remove the surviving sibling from the parents, resulting in an asymptomatic recovery.", 
    "60": "The homogeneity of drug concentrations in skeletal muscle was assessed in eight fatal overdoses. Ten to 30 random samples were taken from leg muscle weighing 1,650 to 7,985 g. For cases involving paracetamol the mean muscle-to-blood ratio ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 (n = 4) for amitriptyline 1.1 to 3.6 (n = 3), and for dothiepin 0.8 to 2.1 (n = 2). The coefficient of variance was large for all drugs, ranging from 10.5 (carbamazepine) to 50 (thioridazine). Skeletal muscle is not homogeneous with respect to drug concentrations in fatal overdose cases. Of 16 instances of drug detection in blood 2 (nortriptyline and promethazine) were not detected in muscle. Muscle-to-blood drug ratios varied significantly among cases, possibly influenced by survival time after drug ingestion. Quantitative interpretations of muscle drug levels present significant difficulties. However, skeletal muscle can be used for qualitative corroboration of blood analyses and is a suitable specimen for drug detection where none other is available.", 
    "61": "Beginning in 1990, the Department of Psychiatry. Tripler Army Medical Center developed a formal treatment program for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Between 1990 and 1996, 632 patients, the vast majority of whom suffered from combat-related PTSD, were treated. Historically, many PTSD patients were treated with benzodiazepines, often in high dosages. The risks attendant to benzodiazepine management of PTSD, coupled with poor clinical outcome, prompted the staff to explore treatment alternatives. This paper describes the role of pharmacotherapy in the management of PTSD. The medications described in this paper have other primary uses in clinical practice (e.g., hypertension, insomnia, seizure control, depression, and anxiety). Medications were selected for use based on the putative modes of action and the degree of symptom relief. The therapeutic rationale was to decrease hyperarousal and sleep disturbance to permit the patients to engage in other psychotherapeutic efforts.", 
    "62": "Peak spectral amplitudes for choline moieties (Cho), creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and myo-inositol (mI) were examined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 19 social-phobia patients and 10 controls. Compared with controls, social phobics demonstrated significantly lower NAA/Cho and higher Cho/Cr, mI/Cr, and mI/NAA amplitudes in cortical gray matter. Higher mI/Cr and mI/NAA amplitudes for social phobics were also observed in subcortical gray matter. Minimal between-group differences were noted for white matter. Symptom severity correlated inversely with amplitudes primarily in subcortical gray matter, and to a lesser extent in cortical gray matter. Inclusion of age and sex in statistical modeling strengthened comparisons with controls but eliminated those for symptom severity. No changes were observed in any amplitude measure following at least 8 weeks of clonazepam treatment, nor was a relationship observed between amplitudes and cumulative clonazepam dose. The possible psychobiological implications of our findings in social phobia are discussed.", 
    "63": "Although the practice of restraining combative patients is commonplace, restraint has been neither uniform nor scrutinized in the air medical transport environment. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the use of physical and chemical restraining methods in air medical and critical care transport settings. A retrospective study was performed through faxed questionnaires to 92 medical directors who were members of the Air Medical Physician Association (AMFA). Neither program size nor program type correlated with the use of a particular restraint method. Cloth, including gauze, was the most common physical restraint (73%); both benzodiazepines and paralytics were the most common chemical restraints (53%). Injury to crew members was not widespread. This study of air transport services reported a lower incidence of injury to personnel (17%) than is reported in studies from emergency departments (EDs) (60%). This study also indicated that air transport services possess protocols governing actions toward violent patients (65%) more often than has been reported in studies on EDs (50%). Protocols varied in nature and extent. Consensus protocols should be established and implemented with the aid of detailed data acquisition to standardize personnel education in managing violent patients.",

    "66": "A study was conducted to compare the performance of the OnLine and OnTrak immunoassays for benzodiazepines with gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis in detecting flunitrazepam (FNP) and its metabolites in human urine. Urine was collected over a 72-h period from six individuals (four male and two female) who had taken a single oral dose of either 1 or 4 mg of FNP. The OnTrak assay was run at a 100-ng/mL cutoff of nordiazepam (NDP), and the OnLine assay was run with a standard curve from zero to 200 ng/mL of NDP with and without beta-glucuronidase treatment. Each sample was analyzed by GC-MS using FNP, 7-amino-FNP, 3-hydroxy-FNP, desmethyl-FNP, 7-amino-3-hydroxy-FNP, and desmethyl-3-hydroxy-FNP as standards with beta-glucuronidase treatment. The specimens from the 1-mg dose did not yield a positive result by immunoassay over the 72-h collection period. Specimens from the 4-mg dose did yield positive results in both immunoassays. The time of the first positive result ranged from 4 to 12 h, and the time to the last positive result ranged from 18 to 60 h. Treatment of the samples with beta-glucuronidase increased the OnLine values between 20 and 60%, but it did not appreciably increase the detection time. GC-MS analysis showed no detectable levels of FNP, 3-hydroxy-FNP, desmethyl-FNP, 7-amino-3-hydroxy-FNP, and desmethyl-3-hydroxy-FNP. However, all samples collected past time zero showed detectable levels of 7-amino-FNP (> 2 ng/mL) with peak concentrations at 12-36 h. The peak levels of 7-amino-FNP by GC-MS paralleled the peak levels of the immunoassay response. The amount of 7-amino-FNP metabolite quantitated by GC-MS, however, accounted for only 15-20% of the total immunoassay crossreactive FNP metabolites.",

Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of these specimens for FN, 3-OH-FN, 7-amino-FN, 7-amino-3-OH-FN, desmethyl-FN, and 3-OH-desmethyl-FN after glucuronidase treatment showed only low levels of 7-amino-FN with almost none of the other metabolites. These levels were far below the expected results based on the immunoassay data. This study reports on a GC-MS procedure for FN and the previously listed metabolites. The method is based on acid hydrolysis of the urine specimens, which converts FN and all its metabolites described previously to one of four amino-benzophenone derivatives (1-4) with oxazepam-d5 as the internal standard. Under the experimental conditions, the internal standard is converted to 2-amino-5-chloro-benzophenone-d5. The limit of detection for 7-amino-FN and 7-amino-desmethyl-FN and their 3-OH derivatives was less than 1 ng/mL. Analysis of urine specimens collected for 72-h postingestion of 1, 2, or 4 mg FN showed appreciable levels of benzophenone 3 (product of 7-amino-FN and 7-amino-3-OH-FN) and lower levels of benzophenone 4 (product of 7-amino-desmethyl-FN and 7-amino-3-OH-desmethyl-FN) with no detectable levels of benzophenones 1 and 2. The method makes it possible to confirm the presence of FN metabolites in urine at least 72-h postingestion of small doses of the drug.",

Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent exhibiting regional mesolimbic dopaminergic selectivity and a broad-based pharmacology encompassing serotonin, dopamine, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptor binding affinities. The authors' goal was to compare the incidence of tardive dyskinesia among patients receiving olanzapine and those receiving the conventional dopamine 2 antagonist haloperidol.",

All of the subjects had a chronic disease course (mean greater than 10 years), and there were no significant between-treatment group differences in demographic or disease characteristics.

However, children may experience significant fear and anxiety before receiving these medications, especially during separation from parents and during venipuncture. Intranasal administration of midazolam represents a noninvasive method of sedating children before anxiety-producing events. The objective of this study was to determine whether premedication with intranasal midazolam reduces stress and anxiety of separation from parents and of undergoing venipuncture, while maintaining adequate sedation during EGD.", 
    "73": "This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in 40 children, aged 2 to 12 years, who were undergoing EGD. Patients in group I were premedicated with intranasal placebo (0.9% NaCl) followed 10 minutes later by intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and intravenous meperidine (1 mg/ kg). Patients in group II were premedicated with intranasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) followed by intravenous placebo (0.9% NaCl) and intravenous meperidine (1 mg/kg). Anxiolysis and sedation were scored by a blinded observer, who identified minor and major negative behaviors during four observation periods: intranasal drug administration, separation from parents, venipuncture, and EGD.",

Negative behaviors appeared to increase during administration of intranasal midazolam or placebo.", 
    "75": "Premedication with intranasal midazolam is effective in reducing negative behaviors during separation from parents, while it maintains sedation during the endoscopic procedure. The benefits of intranasal administration may be negated, however, by irritation, and discomfort caused by intranasal drug delivery.", 
    "76": "Most general anesthetics produce two distinct actions at GABA(A) receptors. Thus, these drugs augment GABA-gated chloride currents (referred to as an indirect action) and, at higher concentrations, elicit chloride currents in the absence of GABA (referred to as a direct action). Because a beta subunit appears to be required for the direct action of intravenous anesthetics in recombinant GABA(A) receptors, site-directed mutagenesis of the beta3 subunit was performed to identify amino acid residues that are critical for this action. In HEK293 cells expressing a prototypical GABA(A) receptor composed of alpha1beta3gamma2 subunits, mutation of amino acid 290 from Asn to Ser dramatically reduced both etomidate-induced chloride currents and its ability to stimulate [3H]flunitrazepam binding. By contrast, the ability of etomidate to augment GABA-gated chloride currents and GABA-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding was retained. The demonstration that the direct, but not the indirect, actions of etomidate are dependent on beta3(Asn290) indicates that the dual actions of this intravenous anesthetic at GABA(A) receptors are mediated via distinct loci.", 
    "77": "Acetylcholine plays an important role in cortical arousal. Adenosine is released during increased metabolism and has been suggested to be a sleep-promoting factor. To understand the interaction of acetylcholine and adenosine in regulating cortical excitability, we examined the effect of carbachol on NMDA-evoked adenosine release and identified the muscarinic receptor subtype that mediated this effect in adult rat cortical slices in vitro. Carbachol (to 300 microM) alone did not affect the basal release of adenosine. However, carbachol (100 microM) induced a 253% increase in NMDA (20 microM)-evoked adenosine release in the presence of Mg2+. In the absence of Mg2+, carbachol's potentiating effect was less (60% increase). The nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine (1.5 microM) blocked the facilitatory effect of carbachol on NMDA-evoked adenosine release, and this was mimicked by the M3-selective antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (1 microM). Neither an M1-selective dose of pirenzepine (50 nM) nor the M2-selective antagonist methoctramine (1 microM) affected carbachol's action on NMDA-evoked adenosine release. Carbachol had no effect on adenosine release evoked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA). These results suggest that acetylcholine does not affect basal adenosine release but enhances NMDA receptor-mediated evoked adenosine release by acting at M3 receptors in the cortex. This interaction may have a role in regulating cortical neuronal excitability on a long-term basis.", 
    "78": "The vast molecular heterogeneity of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors forms the basis for receptor subtyping. Using autoradiographic techniques, we established the characteristics of cerebellar granule cell GABAA receptors by comparing wild-type mice with those with a targeted disruption of the alpha6 subunit gene. Cerebellar granule cells of alpha6(-/-) animals have severe deficits in high affinity [3H]muscimol and [3H]SR 95531 binding to GABA sites, in agonist-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to benzodiazepine sites, and in furosemide-induced increases in tert-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding to picrotoxin-sensitive convulsant sites. These observations agree with the known specific properties of these sites on recombinant alpha6beta2/3gamma2 receptors. In the presence of GABA concentrations that fail to activate alpha1 subunit-containing receptors, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline (30 microM), allopregnanolone (100 nM), and Zn2+ (10 microM) are less efficacious in altering tert-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in the granule cell layer of the alpha6(-/-) than alpha6(+/+) animals. These data concur with the deficiency of the cerebellar alpha6 and delta subunit-containing receptors in the alpha6(-/-) animals and could also account for the decreased affinity of [3H]muscimol binding to alpha6(-/-) cerebellar membranes. Predicted additional alterations in the cerebellar receptors of the mutant mice may explain a surplus of methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-insensitive receptors in the alpha6(-/-) granule cell layer and an increased diazepam-sensitivity in the molecular layer. These changes may be adaptive consequences of altered GABAA receptor subunit expression patterns in response to the loss of two subunits (alpha and delta) from granule cells.", 
    "79": "There are few reports on the course of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease during pregnancy. We report here the clinical course of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease before, during and after pregnancy and discuss the possible effect of pregnancy on M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and the treatment of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease during pregnancy. In the present case, the vertigo attacks increased up to 10 times per month during early pregnancy, when the serum osmolality was significantly below normal at 268 mosm/kg. As the pregnancy proceeded, the serum osmolality normalized and the vertigo attacks decreased in frequency. The vertigo attacks were treated by oral isosorbide and intramuscular injection of low-dose diazepam. The coincidence of the decline in osmolality with the increase in vertigo attacks points to serum osmolality as a possible factor in the effect of pregnancy on M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.", 
    "80": "Modern anesthetic techniques involve combinations of intravenous (i.v.) and inhaled anesthetic drugs that may produce synergistic (supraadditive), additive, or antagonistic interactions. Synergistic interaction is most likely to occur when two or more drugs produce similar effects by different mechanisms. All of the tested combinations of opioids and i.v. sedative-hypnotics have been shown to produce synergistic hypnotic effects, and the majority of these interactions are predictable and useful in daily practice. Opioids, benzodiazepines, lidocaine, and alpha-2 agonists can all reduce the requirements for volatile anesthetics, but only the opioids and the alpha-2 agonists produce this effect at clinically acceptable concentrations. The usefulness of a drug interaction depends on whether it produces greater efficacy or reduced toxicity. Surprisingly, these outcomes have only been specifically measured for a handful of common drug combinations.", 
    "81": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and lorazepam are effective treatments for catatonia. ECT combined with benzodiazepines has been associated with reduced efficacy and efficiency and therefore is not recommended in the routine practice of ECT. We report 5 prospectively identified cases of catatonia treated either sequentially or concurrently with lorazepam and ECT. In each case, the combination of lorazepam with ECT was superior to monotherapy. This apparent synergism, its possible mechanisms, and its implications for treating catatonia are discussed.", 
    "82": "Recently a number of studies have provided evidence which suggests that CCK and 5-HT interact in the control of food intake. The present experiments further examine this mechanism and the possibility that CCK and 5-HT interact in the control of gastric emptying. The selective CCK-A receptor antagonist, devazepide, (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) administered alone had no intrinsic effect on gastric emptying. Devazepide (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) blocked dl-fenfluramine-induced (3.0 mg/kg) suppression of gastric emptying. However, devazepide (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) failed to attenuate the anorectic effect of the same dose of dl-fenfluramine. These results suggest that under the present experimental conditions CCK and 5-HT interact in the regulation of gastric emptying but not food intake. Thus the interaction between CCK and 5-HT in the regulation of gastric emptying appears not to affect the control of ingestive behaviour.", 
    "83": "The stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) paradigm in group-housed mice allows screening of putative anxiolytic drugs. The group-housed SIH was adapted to singly housed animals in order to drastically reduce the number of animals used. The effect of various stressors on rectal temperature was measured in order to find a simple and reliable test procedure. Repeated, but not single disturbance of animals resulted in a strong hyperthermia (deltaT) within 10 min. Similar hyperthermic responses were obtained after immobilization for 1 min or rectal temperature measurement itself. Neither a 120 dB acoustic stimulus, nor repeated 1 mA footshocks led to a temperature change, but 2 mA electric footshocks led to hyperthermia. The final test paradigm chosen involved repeated temperature measurement at a 10 min interval, thus providing both information on basal temperature and deltaT in each animal within a short time frame. Repeated temperature measurements at 10 min intervals revealed a maximum hyperthermia after approximately 30 min, but up to 70% of the hyperthermia is already present 10 min after the first measurement. Repeated use of animals at successive daily or weekly intervals resulted in a gradual increase of both the basal temperature and the temperature 10 min later. At short inter-test intervals (one day) deltaT also decreased, whereas weekly intervals did not affect the amplitude of deltaT. Prior injection of the animals resulted in modest hyperthermia, that returned to baseline after 60 min. The anxiolytics diazepam and 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan dose-dependently suppressed SIH. The antidepressant amitriptyline lowered temperature levels but did not affect deltaT. The SIH model in singly housed mice appears a fast and reproducible screening test for anxiolytic activity. Compared to the group-housed version, the singly-housed SIH enabled a drastic reduction in the number of animals used.", 
    "84": "The anticonvulsant properties of several 1,4-benzodiazepine and azirino[1,2-d][1,4]benzodiazepine (ABDZ) derivatives were studied after intraperitoneal (IP) administration in DBA/2 mice (a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures) and in Swiss mice. The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated on seizures evoked by means of auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12-16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a hemispheric Perspex dome or on seizures induced by administration of pentylenetetrazole. The 1,4-benzodiazepines were generally more potent than the related ABDZ derivatives. The rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity was flunitrazepam > diazepam > pinazepam > ABDZ5 > ABDZ4 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ1 > ABDZ3 > camazepam > ABDZ6 > ABDZ2. The impairment of locomotor performance following IP administration of these derivatives was also evaluated by means of the rotarod test. The rank order of potency for impairment of coordinated motor movements was pinazepam > flunitrazepam > diazepam > ABDZ5 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ4 > ABDZ3 > ABDZ1 > camazepam > ABDZ2 = ABDZ6. The potency of various 1,4-benzodiazepines and ABDZs as inhibitors of specific [3H]flumazenil binding to membranes from cerebellum or cortex was evaluated. In general, ABDZs were active as anticonvulsants and inhibited [3H]flumazenil binding in the micromolar range. Radioligand binding studies carried out in stable cell lines demonstrated that none of the ABDZs tested showed a particular subtype specificity. The pharmacological actions of ABDZ4 and ABDZ5, which appeared to be the most potent ABDZs as anticonvulsants, were significantly reduced by treatment with flumazenil (8.24 mumol/kg IP), suggesting a clear involvement of benzodiazepine mechanisms in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds or their metabolites. The anticonvulsant activity of ABDZ4 and ABDZ5 was also evaluated against seizures induced in DBA/2 mice by two beta-carbolines: methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl-6,6-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). Both ABDZ4 and ABDZ5 give better protection against seizures induced by beta-CCM than DMCM, suggesting a preferential action on the benzodiazepine receptor subtype BDZ1.", 
    "85": "Changes in the GABA-benzodiazepine system were investigated following regular handling of male chicks. Compared with handling-naive chicks, those exposed to 10 days of gentle handling required a larger number of inductions and had a lower duration of tonic immobility. Corresponding biochemical changes occurred, with handling-habituated chicks having a significantly lower basal [14C]GABA release from archistriatal slices and a reduction in the Bmax of [3H]muscimol binding in the forebrain. Benzodiazepine binding in the archistriatum was investigated using in vitro quantitative receptor autoradiography. Binding was localised in the anterior, mediale, dorsalis, and ventralis intermedium nuclei of the archistriatum, and there was significantly more binding in the anterior and ventralis intermedium/mediale archistriatum nuclei than in the dorsalis intermedium archistriatum nuclei. Benzodiazepine binding was not altered after handling in any of the investigated nuclei of the archistriatum. The results suggest that whereas several days of gentle handling in chicks leads to a decrease in forebrain GABAA receptors and a decrease in GABA release from the archistriatum, there are no accompanying changes in benzodiazepine receptors. Regular handling exerts a specific effect on chicks: it reduces their fear or human beings but not that of novel places or objects. It is possible that the pattern of biochemical changes observed in the present study may be specifically associated with this particular behavioural modification rather than with a change in general fearfulness.", 
    "86": "Flumazenil (FLU; 25 micrograms) and DMSO-vehicle were focally injected (1 microliter) into the substantia nigra (SN) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) in rats chronically implanted with silastic capsules containing diazepam (DZ; 540 mg/week). FLU precipitated an abstinence syndrome in the SN as indicated by a significant abstinence score, several abstinence signs and reduced total power of the fast frequency bands of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in the injections sites frontal cortex, (FC) and hippocampus (H). In contrast, FLU did not produce an abstinence syndrome in the DR, and its effect on the power of the EEG in DR, FC and H was not significantly different from that of the DMSO-vehicle. The data show regional heterogeneity in the response of the SN and the DR to chronic DZ treatment in terms of a focally precipitated abstinence syndrome.", 
    "87": "Different groups of mice received one daily dose (50 mg/kg) of morphine subcutaneously (SC) for 3, 4 or 5 days to develop tolerance to the opioid. The antinociceptive response of morphine (9 mg/kg) was tested in the hot-plate test 24 h after the last dose of the drug. Tolerance to morphine was obtained in all groups. The group of mice that received morphine for 4 days was employed for the rest of the experiments. Pretreatment of animals with a single dose of caerulein (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg, SC) 30 min prior to receiving morphine (50 mg/kg; during the development of tolerance to the opioid) on day 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 of morphine administration potentiate antinociception induced by morphine (test dose of 9 mg/kg). The dose of 0.05 mg/kg of caerulein, used 30 min before morphine administration on day 3, was also used to evaluate the effects of antagonists on caerulein-induced decrease in tolerance. The selective cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists, MK-329 [1-methyl-3-(2 indoloyl)amino-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one; 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg] or L-365,260 [3R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H- 1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl)-N-(3-methyl-phenyl)urea: 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg] decreased potentiation of morphine response induced by caerulein. MK-329 or L-365,260, when were injected 35 min before morphine injection during the development of tolerance and on day 3, decreased the tolerance to morphine. A single administration of MK-329 or L-365,260 (in the absence of caerulein) 35 min and 48 h before the test dose of morphine (9 mg/kg) potentiated the antinociception of morphine in nontolerant animals. In conclusion, CCK mechanism(s) may interact with morphine tolerance.", 
    "88": "Earlier results obtained in one of our laboratories showed that microinjection into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of the excitatory amino acid kainic acid, the benzodiazepine (BZD) inverse agonist FG 7142, and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OHDPAT changed the behavior of rats in the elevated T-maze, an animal model of anxiety. The present study investigates biochemical correlates of these results in awake rats by measuring 5-HT release with in vivo microdialysis in two brain structures innervated by the DRN-the amygdala (Am) and the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG)-that have been implicated in anxiety. Microinjection of kainic acid (60 pmol) into the DRN significantly increased 5-HT release in both the Am and the DPAG. In the DPAG, the increase was 14-fold higher with respect to the baseline and occurred only at the first sample, which was collected 30 min after the injection. In the Am, the increase was less pronounced (nearly fourfold) but persistent, lasting until the fourth sample, which was collected 120 min from the injection. FG 7142 (40 pmol) and 8-OH-DPAT (8 nmol) were ineffective. Because only intra-DRN kainate both increased inhibitory avoidance and decreased one-way escape in the elevated T-maze, the present behavioral results support the suggestion that 5-HT facilitates conditioned fear in the Am and inhibits unconditioned fear in the DPAG.", 
    "89": "The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of housing and handling conditions during testing, as well as data analysis, on the outcome of antinociceptive testing of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, fentanyl, and a high dose of chlordiazepoxide in the tail withdrawal reaction test (TWR test) in rats. Dose-response curve data were obtained with fentanyl, clonidine, xylazine, dexmedetomidine, and 40.00 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide and were compared under normal TWR test conditions and during immobilization or immobilization with continuous painful stimulation. Data were analyzed in terms of all-or-none criteria as well as percentage maximum possible effect (%MPE) analysis over the total measurement period or at any specific time point during testing. The results indicate that stress, induced by immobilization and immobilization with long-term-applied paw pressure, unmasked possible antinociceptive properties of the various alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists and potentiated the effects of fentanyl. Stress also unmasked the positive effects of benzodiazepines. The manner of data analysis was shown to significantly affect the outcome measured in stress and nonstress conditions. The MPE analysis, particularly at one time point, appeared much more sensitive than the all-or-none criteria. The data indicate that the housing and handling conditions of animals during testing, together with data analysis, may affect the outcome of different classes of compounds in the TWR test, and this knowledge may help control for false positive results.", 
    "90": "A method of measuring confrontation-induced behavioural changes in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) together with automated monitoring of locomotor activity has been developed as a possible model of anxiety. Recording both affiliative and agonistic behaviours between male/female pairs of marmosets and using diazepam as a reference drug, it has been possible to define a profile of behavioural changes which could be regarded as representing an anxiolytic response. Unfamiliar male/female pairs of marmosets were brought into close (non-contact) proximity in a controlled environment, in which their locomotor activity was recorded automatically. Simultaneously, their interactive behaviour was assessed by an independent observer via closed-circuit television. The following behaviours were analysed: aggressive postures, allogrooming, scratching, anxiety-related behaviours, social contact and self-grooming. Administration of diazepam at 1 and 3.5 mg/kg PO induced a significant (compared to control) reduction in scratching, aggressive behaviours, anxiety-related behaviours and an increase in allogrooming without affecting locomotor activity during confrontation. Differing responses dependent on gender were not found, nor did gender influence the effect of treatment on behaviour. Habituation to repeated confrontation did not occur. The results from this study demonstrate that this method can be used to measure anxiolytic activity in an objective manner.", 
    "91": "The present study examines the effects of chronic diazepam treatment on conflict behavior in rats using the Geller-Seifter paradigm. A dose-response function for the effects of diazepam (DZ) on punished and unpunished responding was determined (0.0, 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg DZ intraperitoneally) using five independent groups. The test doses of DZ produced an inverted U-shaped function where punished responding increased as a function of dose up to 2.5 mg/kg and then decreased at 5.0 mg/kg. All groups were then treated with 2 x 5 mg/kg DZ per day for 5 days. When the dose-response function was redetermined at 36 h post-chronic treatment, it was found that the function had shifted to the right, indicating tolerance. Because of the inverted U-shaped nature of the original function, tolerance was manifested as a decrease in responding on the ascending portion of the function and as an increase in responding on the dose (5 mg/kg) representing the descending side of the inverted U.", 
    "92": "Minaxolone is a potent ligand for the neurosteroid binding site of the GABAA, receptor. In radioligand binding studies to rat brain membranes, minaxolone caused a 69% increase in [3H]muscimol binding and a 25% increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding and inhibited the binding of [3H]TBOB with an IC50 of 1 microM. In mice, minaxolone (100 mg/kg, orally) had marked sedative effects as indicated by a reduction in locomotor activity. Chronic dosing with minaxolone (100 mg/kg, orally, once daily for 7 days) resulted in a loss of sedative response to an acute dose of the drug, indicating development of tolerance. Chronic dosing with temazepam (10 mg/kg, orally, once daily for 7 days) resulted in the development of tolerance to an acute dose of temazepam; however, the two drugs did not appear to be cross-tolerant, indicating that they may have a different mechanism of action at the level of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "93": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat, an early regulatory protein that is critical for viral gene expression and replication, transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) via its binding to the transactivation response element (TAR) and, along with other cellular factors, increases viral transcription initiation and elongation. Tat also superactivates the HIV-1 promoter through a TAR-independent mechanism, including tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of NF-kappa B, and inhibitors of Tat and NF-kappa B cooperatively down-regulate this Tat-mediated LTR superactivation. In this study, a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy using two PKC (NF-kappa B) inhibitors, pentoxifylline (PTX) and G\u00f6-6976, and a stably expressed anti-Tat single-chain intracellular antibody (sFv intrabody) was employed to obtain cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication. Treatment of cells with PTX and G\u00f6-6976 resulted in cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication. In addition, the combined use of anti-Tat sFv intrabodies and the two NF-kappa B inhibitors retained the virus in the latent state for as long as 45 days. The combined treatment resulted in more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than was seen with the NF-kappa B inhibitors alone or the anti-Tat sFv intrabodies alone. Together, these results suggest that in future clinical gene therapy trials, a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy like the one reported here may improve the survival of transduced cells and prolong clinical benefit.", 
    "94": "In vivo microdialysis was used to determine the effect of diazepam, flumazenil and FG-7142 upon the biogenic amine response to acute and repeated swim stress in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat. Acute swim stress increased norepinephrine levels, although dopamine and serotonin levels remained stable. Upon re-exposure to swim stress twenty-four hours later, sustained increases (200-300% of baseline) in all three biogenic amines were detected. This enhanced response to re-stress was not seen in rats pretreated with either a benzodiazepine: agonist (diazepam, 2 mg/kg), an antagonist (flumazenil, 10 mg/kg), or an inverse agonist (FG-7142, 10 mg/kg) given prior to the first swim stress. Therefore, the sensitization of biogenic amine response to re-stress may be prevented by compounds which differ in their activity at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "95": "Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) can be used as selective inhibitors of in vivo gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of experimental animals. The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors. GABAA receptor function is allosterically modulated by several clinically important compounds, e.g. 1,4-benzodiazepines, barbiturates and certain neurosteroids, which recognize binding sites within the receptor complex. GABAA receptor chloride channel complexes are probably pentamers of different polypeptide subunits. The number of known subunit families and isoforms (six alpha s, four beta s, three gamma s, one delta and two rho s) indicates an extensive heterogeneity of GABAA receptors. The gamma 2 subunit is a functionally integral part of the GABAA receptor, necessary for the high affinity binding of benzodiazepines. The infusion of phosphorothioate ODN antisense to the gamma 2 subunit mRNA, but not control sense or mismatch ODN, into the lateral cerebral ventricle or into the hippocampus of rats leads to significant decreases in benzodiazepine receptor radioligand binding. In the hippocampus this is accompanied by a decrease in the number of GABAA receptors and by a loss of neurones, the latter possibly being due to reduced GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. Autoradiographic analysis following continuous intrahippocampal infusion of antisense ODN shows the regional extent of the effect on [3H]flunitrazepam binding. The continuous infusion of antisense ODN, but not of mismatch control ODN, into the right lateral cerebral ventricle induced a significant decrease in benzodiazepine binding and [3H]muscimol binding to membranes of the right cortex. Antisense ODN infused into the striatum decreased benzodiazepine binding and binding to the GABA binding site of the GABAA receptor to an extent similar to that found in the hippocampus. It is concluded that the preferred route of administration of antisense ODN for in vivo studies of the GABAA receptor may be by infusion into defined rat brain regions. The reported data support the idea that antisense ODN can be used as a valuable tool for the investigation of the contribution of individual GABAA receptor subunits to the properties of the receptor complex and of mechanisms of receptor subunit assembly.", 
    "96": "A study of the four extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, akathisia and tardive dystonia, was performed in the Netherlands Antilles, a well-defined catchment area with only one psychiatric hospital. The population under study (N = 194; mean age 53.1) was mainly Afro-Caribbean, and most patients were chronic. The severity of each EPS was measured with valid and reliable rating scales. The purpose was to study both the strength of the inter-relationships of EPS and the prevalence of combinations of EPS. The inter-relationships between the EPS were analyzed by means of logistic regression. The adjusted odds ratios between the various EPS revealed strong connections between the hyperkinetic syndromes (tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia and akathisia). Parkinsonism was found to be inversely related to tardive dyskinesia and to tardive dystonia. Almost 30% of the patients suffered from two or more EPS. The highest prevalence rates of combinations were: tardive dyskinesia combined with parkinsonism 12.9%, tardive dyskinesia combined with tardive dystonia 9.8%, and tardive dyskinesia combined with akathisia 5.2%. Our findings show a strong positive correlation between hyperkinetic forms of EPS. Furthermore, chronic psychiatric inpatients regularly suffer from combinations of EPS. Different treatment strategies are suggested for various combinations of EPS.", 
    "97": "A synthetic-computational approach to the study of the binding site of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands related to 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide (PK11195, 1) within their receptor has been developed. A wide series of conformationally restrained derivatives of 1 has been designed with the aim of probing the PBR binding site systematically. The synthesis of these compounds involves palladium-catalyzed coupling and amidation as the key steps. Twenty-nine rigid and semirigid derivatives of 1 were tested in binding studies using [3H]-1, and most of these showed PBR affinities in the nanomolar range. The essential role of the carbonyl moiety as a primary pharmacophoric element in the recognition by and the binding to PBR has been confirmed, and the restricted range of the carbonyl orientations, which characterizes the most potent ligands, points to a specific hydrogen-bonding interaction, mainly directed by the geometrical factors, when the electronic ones are fulfilled. Moreover, the fundamental importance of the short-range dispersive interactions in the modulation of the binding affinity and, hence, in the stabilization of the ligand-receptor complex, emerged from the QSAR models reported.", 
    "98": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.", 
    "99": "The present study was designed to investigate the effect of i.c.v. administration of various muscarinic receptor antagonists in rats on memory performance in delayed non-matching to position test. The drugs chosen were the non-selective antagonist scopolamine (3 and 10 micrograms), the muscarinic M1 receptor-selective antagonist pirenzepine (10 and 30 micrograms) and the muscarinic M2 receptor-selective antagonist methoctramine (2, 5 and 20 micrograms). Scopolamine delay-independently decreased % correct choices and reduced motor activity. Pirenzepine also delay-independently decreased % correct choices. In contrast, methoctramine 2 micrograms, but not at 5 or 20 micrograms, improved slightly, but significantly, % correct performance delay-dependently. The present data suggests that the decrease in activation of inhibitory muscarinic M2 autoreceptors induced by methoctramine produces a specific improvement of short-term memory at long forgetting delays.", 
    "100": "Clinical observations of patients under oral opioid treatment suggest that the initially appearing central side effects such as sedation, dizziness or drowsiness decrease after a few weeks of treatment. However, it is still unclear whether long-term treatment with opioids impairs complex psychomotor functions such as driving a car.", 
    "101": "Twenty patients on stable dosages of oral opioids were examined using a driving simulator. The patients were regular car drivers and not older than 70 years. Additionally, every patient had to complete a questionnaire for mental condition and vigilance and the \"d II\" letter cancellation task. Control groups tested in the same way were: patients before an elective operation after taking benzodiazepines for sedation, volunteers after alcohol consumption (0.80 per thousand ), physicians on call with less than 4 h of sleep and healthy volunteers without any medication.", 
    "102": "Some of the patients treated with opioids reacted as fast as medication-free volunteers. There were no significant differences between the reaction times of older patients (>50 years) receiving opioids in comparison to the group of older healthy volunteers. The same result was obtained in the letter cancellation task. No differences could be seen between medication-free volunteers and patients receiving opioids with regard to tasks of visual or motor control skills. The volunteers under influence of alcohol and the patients under benzodiazepines had a considerable decrease in performance.", 
    "103": "Long-term therapy with opioids does not inevitably impair complex skills, but the decision to permit driving a car can only be made in the individual case.", 
    "104": "At the beginning of therapy with opioids the physician has to fulfil his duty to inform the patient of any possible dangers of treatment. From the medical point of view, driving must be prohibited until a stable opioid dosage is reached. Any changes in dosage (increase, reduction), change of the opioid and poor general condition independent of the opioid therapy must result in prohibition of car driving. Continuous control of the therapy with documentation is a duty of the physician. The written documentation should include the patients' physical and mental condition, side effects and the therapeutic result. From the medical point of view, driving can be possible when dosage treatment and general condition remain stable. In any case, the doctor has to remind the patient of the responsibility of critical self-examination. In doubt, special performance investigation should be taken into consideration.", 
    "105": "Since 1959, the Norwegian Road Traffic Act has prohibited driving under the influence of drugs other than alcohol. On suspicion, the police request a clinical examination from any driver, as well as blood analyses for illegal and prescribed drugs affecting driving performance. During the last few years, there has been a marked increase in the number of drivers suspected of be influenced by drugs (1983, n = 900; 1995, n = 3329). The most commonly detected drugs are tetrahydrocannabinol, amphetamine, benzodiazepines and opiates. Multi-drug use is frequently found (> 60%). The occurrence of amphetamine (1991, n = 216; 1995, n = 937) and heroin (1991, n = 19; 1995, n = 172) has increased considerably. The frequency of drugged drivers apprehended in roadside traffic appears to be at least 10-fold higher in Norway than most other countries. This is probably mainly due to differences between national road traffic acts and the level of attention to the problem, and not to national differences in the prevalence of drugged driving.", 
    "106": "The long-term consequences of neonatal exposure to diazepam (DZP) on behavioral abilities and local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in 12 brain regions involved in the control of memory and anxiety were studied in adult rats. Rat pups received a daily subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg DZP or of the dissolution vehicle from postnatal day (P) 2 to 21. Learning and memory were tested in P60-P70 rats over 5 consecutive days in a T maze and an eight-arm maze while anxiety and reaction to novelty were tested in a two-compartment box with a two-step staircase on the enriched side. LCGU was measured in the P60 rat by the quantitative autoradiographic [14C]deoxyglucose method. In the T maze, when performed without delay between the two trials, the rate of alternation was significantly lower in DZP- than in vehicle-exposed rats on the first 2 days of testing and similar in both groups on days 3-5. In the procedure with a 30 s intertrial delay, the rate of alternation was similar in DZP- and vehicle-treated rats on all days of testing. In the eight-arm maze, DZP-treated rats were more active, i.e., entered more arms per minute than control animals. The number of arms entered before the first error was lower on day 1 and higher on day 3 in DZP- compared to vehicle-exposed rats. In the two-compartment box, DZP-treated rats crossed more often and spent more time than controls on the lower step of the staircase while control rats made more rearings and spent more time than DZP-exposed rats in the well protected corner of the box. LCGU were decreased by early DZP exposure in six regions which were mammillary body, septum, visual and prefrontal cortices, dorsomedian caudate nucleus and mediodorsal thalamus. In conclusion, postnatal DZP treatment induced at adulthood an increase in activity, a delay in task acquisition but no learning-memory impairment and reduced the level of anxiety allowing active responding to novelty. These quite subtle behavioral changes were accompanied by discrete metabolic decreases in regions mediating anxiety, reflecting a change in the level of anxiety and emotionality.", 
    "107": "During a 16-month period, nine fatalities occurred among white male drug-addicts, where fentanyl was detected at postmortem toxicological analysis. The street samples associated with these cases confirmed the presence of fentanyl as an additive in low-concentration amphetamine powders with caffeine, phenazone and sugar as cutting agents. In seven of the cases, an acute intoxication by fentanyl was considered to be the immediate cause of death, and in one case, it was likely, but no analysis of fentanyl was performed in blood, and in another case the death was suicide by hanging. This appears to be the first report of a cluster of fentanyl-related deaths outside the United States, and the occurrence of fentanyl in combination with amphetamine has not previously been reported. In addition, in all cases, femoral blood was collected, and samples were handled and analysed according to standardized, quality-controlled procedures. The previous history, circumstances surrounding the death, autopsy findings, histology and toxicology examination of each case are presented. The gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for fentanyl is also described. Fentanyl concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 17 ng g-1 blood, and from 5 to 160 ng ml-1 urine. Other drugs found were amphetamine (8 cases), ethanol (5 cases) and benzodiazepines (5 cases). Morphine was found in only one case. The average age of men was 33.9 years (range 22-44); six were found in their own of friend's apartment, two inside buildings (stairways) and one was found outdoors. We conclude that fentanyl is a dangerous substance that should be considered in drug-addict deaths even outside the United States, particularly when the remaining toxicology is unremarkable, and the cause of death cannot be ascertained", 
    "108": "The effects of single, oral doses of diazepam (10 mg), buspirone (10 mg) and placebo on auditory event-related potentials were assessed in healthy volunteers. Subjects received two series of auditory stimuli: a series of identical stimuli presented in a neutral, passive condition and a series of identical standard tones (P = 0.8), but now intermixed with target tones (P = 0.2), in an active, oddball condition. The analysis focused on the average value of the potential in two different phases, from 250 till 574 ms post-stimulus (including P300) and from 576 till 900 ms post-stimulus (including late slow wave positivity). Event-related potentials for the standards of the oddball task were compared with the potentials of the same stimuli presented in the neutral condition. In addition, the classical comparison between the target and the standard in the oddball task was made. The first comparison was designed to isolate any effect of a change in the level of vigilance and attention due to involvement in the oddball task. This effect was evident as an increase in positivity that was smaller in the diazepam condition. The second comparison was designed to isolate the distinctive processing associated with task-relevant stimuli. This revealed that the P300 was reduced in the 250-574 ms window in the diazepam group. Both results suggest that cognitive processing of relevant stimuli is reduced by diazepam. Presumably, this is associated with the sedative effects of this drug. Consistent with this interpretation, subjects under the influence of diazepam made more omissions in the detection of targets in the oddball condition and had longer reaction times. In contrast to diazepam, the anxiolytic buspirone did not appear to have measurable effects on cognition.", 
    "109": "The type of muscarinic receptor in the central nucleus of the amygdala that mediates the carbachol-evoked pressor responses was investigated in conscious unrestraint Sprague-Dawley rats. Carbachol (100 ng) injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle caused a significant rise in blood pressure of 31.8+/-4.5 mmHg and a decrease in heart rate of 80.0+/-12.2 beats/min. Pirenzepine (10-75 nmol) injected into the central nucleus of the amygdala inhibited carbachol-induced pressor responses dose-dependently. The bradycardic response to carbachol was also inhibited by pirenzepine, but no dose-dependency was observed. Injection of pirenzepine into the basolateral amygdala at a dose (50 nmol) that inhibited carbachol-induced changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate when injected into the central nucleus of the amygdala failed to exert any inhibition. Methoctramine at a dose of 50 nmol injected into both the central nucleus of the amygdala and the basolateral amygdala did not cause any significant alteration in the responses. These results indicate that muscarinic M1 receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala are involved in cardiovascular regulation mediated by central cholinergic pathways.", 
    "110": "GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzo-diaz epi ne), a non-competitive non-NMDA receptor antagonist, was tested against epileptic afterdischarges elicited by cortical stimulation in 12-, 18- and 25-day-old rats with implanted electrodes. Shortening of afterdischarges and a decrease in intensity of clonic movements accompanying both stimulation and afterdischarges were induced by the 20 mg/kg dose of GYKI 52466 in 18- and 25-day-old animals, whereas 12-day-old rat pups exhibited only shortening of electroencephalographic afterdischarges. The 10 mg/kg dose of GYKI 52466 did not significantly change afterdischarges in any age group. Motor skills were compromised after the 20 mg/kg dose of GYKI 52466. This effect was again more marked in 18- and 25-day-old animals than in the youngest group. In addition, anxiolytic-like action was observed in the jumping down test in 25-day-old rats. This effect was not influenced by a benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. On the contrary, the anticonvulsant action of GYKI 52466 was partly blocked by flumazenil, indicating thus multiple mechanisms of action of GYKI 52466.", 
    "111": "The synthesis, photophysical characteristics, in vivo photosensitizing efficacy, human serum albumin (HSA) binding properties, and skin phototoxicity of some stable bacteriochlorins were investigated. The novel bacteriochlorins, obtained from chlorophyll-a, have long-wavelength absorptions in the range lambda max = 734-758 nm. Preferential migration of ethyl over methyl substituents among ketobacteriochlorins obtained in the pinacol-pinacolone rearrangements of vic-dihydroxybacteriochlorins was confirmed by NOE studies. The bacteriochlorins show relatively low fluorescence quantum yields. Among all the bacteriochlorins the triplet states were quenched by ground state molecular oxygen in a relatively similar manner, yielding comparable singlet oxygen quantum yields. In preliminary in vivo studies (DBA/2 mice, transplanted with SMT/F tumors), ketobacteriochlorins were found to be more photodynamically active than the related vic-dihydroxy analogues. Replacement of the methyl ester functionalities with di-tert-butylaspartic acids enhanced the in vivo efficacy. Site specific human serum albumin (HSA) binding studies indicated a direct correlation between the ability of the compound to bind to the diazepam binding site (albumin site II) and the in vivo photosensitizing efficacy.", 
    "112": "We previously described a series of 3-(1H-indazol-3-ylmethyl)-1,5-benzodiazepine CCK-A agonists exemplified by compound 1 (GW 5823), which is the first reported binding selective CCK-A full agonist demonstrating oral efficacy in a rat feeding model. In this report we describe analogs of compound 1 designed to explore changes to the C3 and N1 pharmacophores and their effect on agonist activity and receptor selectivity. Agonist efficacy in this series was affected by stereoelectronic factors within the C3 moiety. Binding affinity for the CCK-A vs CCK-B receptor showed little dependence on the structure of the C3 moiety but was affected by the nature of the second substituent at C3. Structure-activity relationships at the N1-anilidoacetamide \"trigger\" moiety within the C3 indazole series were also investigated. Both agonist efficacy and binding affinity within this series were modulated by variation of substituents on the N1-anilidoacetamide moiety. Evaluation of several analogs in an vivo mouse gallbladder emptying assay revealed compound 1 to be the most potent and efficacious of all the analogs tested. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of 1 in rats is also discussed.", 
    "113": "Behavioral, biochemical, and electrophysiological studies suggest that amperozide affects mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neurotransmission. The receptor binding profile of amperozide is discussed and related to behavioral and clinical, i.e., antipsychotic, effects of the drug. As previously reported, amperozide displayed high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (Ki = 16 nmol/L), and moderate affinity for striatal dopamine D2 (Ki = 540 nmol/L) and cortical alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 172 nmol/L). In the present study amperozide displayed low affinity for several serotonin receptor subtypes as well as for the dopamine D4 receptor transfected in COS7 cells (Ki D4.2 = 769 nmol/L and Ki D4.4 = 384 nmol/L). Amperozide was very weak or did not interact with several other receptor species including adrenergic, histaminergic, muscarinic, benzodiazepine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, amino acid, opiate, and Ca channels; however, amperozide was found to compete for [3H]paroxetine binding for the serotonin transporter in the nanomolar range (Ki = 49 nmol/L). In vitro and in vivo binding potency of amperozide correlates best with behavioral effects, indicating 5-HT2A antagonism, although serotonin uptake inhibition may contribute to the effects of amperozide on dopamine neurotransmission. The metabolite of amperozide, FG5620, displayed 5-10 times lower pharmacologic activity than amperozide. These properties of amperozide may suggest that the antipsychotic effects of amperozide are mediated by 5-HT2A receptors, although 5-HT uptake inhibition and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects may be considered, particularly at higher doses.", 
    "114": "We previously reported that corymine, an alkaloidal compound extracted from the leaves of Hunteria zeylanica native to Thailand, potentiated convulsions induced by either picrotoxin or strychnine. Therefore, to clarify the mechanism of action of corymine, the effects of corymine on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine receptors were examined. We used Xenopus oocytes expressing these receptors and the two-electrode voltage-clamp method. The receptors expressed in oocytes injected with rat brain and spinal cord RNA showed the pharmacological properties of GABAA and glycine receptors, respectively. Corymine (1-100 microM) partially (20-30%) reduced the GABA responses in oocytes injected with rat brain RNA, while marked (up to 80%) dose-dependent reductions were observed in the glycine responses in oocytes injected with rat spinal cord RNA. These observations suggest that corymine was more effective against the glycine receptors than the GABA receptors. The ED50 of corymine on the glycine response was 10.8 microM. Corymine, at 30 microM, caused a shift to the right, with a lower maximal response, of the glycine concentration-response curve. This indicated that the action of corymine on glycine receptors is neither competitive nor purely non-competitive. These observations suggest that a binding site other than the glycine recognition site of the glycine receptors is the site of action of corymine.", 
    "115": "Forty-six near-adult pigs (mean age 10 months, mean weight 156 kg) were anaesthetised for laparoscopy. After intramuscular azaperone (1.0 mg/kg) and ketamine (2.5 mg/kg), 14 of the pigs received intravenous etomidate (200 micrograms/kg) and midazolam (100 micrograms/kg) and 17 were given ketamine (2 mg/kg) and midazolam (100 micrograms/kg). The other 15 pigs were anaesthetised with pentobarbitone (15 to 20 mg/kg) without pre-anaesthetic medication. The duration and adequacy of anaesthesia, recovery rate, and seven physiological variables (ECG, heart rate, indirect arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, minute volume, mean end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration and percentage oxygen saturation of haemoglobin) were compared. Repeated injections were needed in 29 of the 46 cases. Pentobarbitone was the least satisfactory drug because although the haemodynamic variables were greater, it caused more respiratory depression and a higher overall complication rate than the other methods. Apnoea occurred in two pigs, and was fatal in one, and positive pressure ventilation with oxygen was needed in three others. Intubation conditions were poorer and the times to standing, walking and rooting were longer in the pigs anaesthetised with pentobarbitone.", 
    "116": "We evaluated the modulatory effect of the GABA-active neurosteroid alphaxalone on the staircase test behavior of mice. Results were compared with the benzodiazepine alprazolam, the GABA(A) agonist muscimol and the peripheral steroids corticosterone and progesterone. Alphaxalone and alprazolam reduced rearing activity in a dose-dependent manner, at doses that did not suppress climbing. The rearing-suppression effect of alprazolam, but not of alphaxalone, was blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. No such dissociation between the effect on rearing and climbing was obtained with muscimol, and both activities were suppressed, in a flumazenil-insensitive pattern, at high doses. Corticosterone and progesterone did not affect the behavior of the mice. The lack of sensitivity of both phenobarbital and alphaxalone to flumazenil indicates that neither agents act via the benzodiazepine recognition site at the GABA(A) receptor complex.", 
    "117": "Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are used for the selective inhibition of gene expression. Antisense ODNs are promising tools for the investigation of physiological implications of proteins in the central nervous system of rodents in vivo. We have previously demonstrated that a phosphorothioate antisense ODN to the GABA(A) receptor gamma2 subunit, but not sense or mismatch control ODNs, induces a decrease in ex vivo benzodiazepine receptor radioligand binding in rat hippocampus when infused into the hippocampus in vivo [Karle et al., Neurosci. Lett., 202 (1995) 97-100]. This effect is parallelled by a decrease in the number of GABA(A) receptors and an extensive loss of hippocampal neurones. There is increasing awareness of risks of toxic 'non-antisense' effects induced by ODNs, and in particular phosphorothioate ODNs. The present experiments were designed to investigate the specificity of effects induced by the gamma2 subunit antisense ODN. The temporal development of changes in [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding as well as in tissue protein levels supports the notion that the antisense ODN primarily acts by blocking the expression of the targeted receptor subunit protein. Furthermore, it is shown that a threshold for the elicitation of neurodegenerative changes exists. Finally, it is demonstrated that diazepam treatment of rats protects against the development of neuronal cell death induced by the antisense ODN. Collectively, the results support the hypothesis that the neurodegeneration induced by the antisense ODN is a consequence of diminished GABAergic inhibitory tonus following a selective down-regulation of gamma2 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor complexes.", 
    "118": "To examine the role of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in suicide and schizophrenia, we determined BZ receptors in post-mortem brain (Brodmann's area 10) obtained from suicide victims, schizophrenic patients, and control subjects using [3H]RO15-1788 as the radioligand. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of BZ receptors in the cortex of suicide victims was significantly higher compared with controls, but this increase was mainly due to those suicide victims who died by violent means and whose Bmax was significantly higher than of those who died by non-violent means or control subjects. In schizophrenic patients, Bmax was not significantly different from that of control subjects. When the schizophrenic subjects were separated into two groups, those on neuroleptics and those off neuroleptics for at least 12 months, however, the mean Bmax of BZ receptors in the prefrontal cortex in post-mortem brain obtained from schizophrenic patients on neuroleptics was significantly lower than Bmax in drug-free schizophrenic patients or normal controls. There were no significant differences among groups in values of the apparent dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]RO15-1788 binding. These results suggest that BZ receptors are up-regulated in the cortex of suicide victims, specifically those who used violent means, and that neuroleptic treatment may result in decreased central BZ receptor binding in the cortex of schizophrenic patients. Thus, the method of suicide and previous exposure to neuroleptics should be considered in the interpretation of data on BZ receptors.", 
    "119": "The role of presynaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in controlling the neuronal release of excitatory amino acids has been investigated. Stimulation of presynaptic AMPA receptors by the endogenous agonist L-glutamate, or by (R,S)-AMPA, dose-dependently enhanced the Ca(2+)-dependent, tetrodotoxin-insensitive, electrically-stimulated release of [3H]D-aspartate from rat forebrain slices. This AMPA receptor-mediated response showed marked stereoselectivity with the activity residing solely in the (S)-isomer. (R)-AMPA was inactive in this respect. AMPA-evoked responses were significantly enhanced in the presence of the AMPA receptor desensitization inhibitor, cyclothiazide (10 microM). Moreover, responses to both AMPA and glutamate were inhibited by competitive (NBQX) and non-competitive (GYKI 52466) AMPA receptor-selective antagonists in a dose-dependent manner. These results provide strong support for the existence of presynaptic AMPA receptors acting to enhance the synaptic release of excitatory amino acids in the mammalian forebrain. Such a positive feedback system may play an important functional role in physiological (e.g., long-term potentiation) and/or pathological (e.g., epileptogenesis) processes in the mammalian central nervous system. AMPA-type autoreceptors may provide new targets for drug action.", 
    "120": "Benzodiazepines allosterically modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) evoked chloride currents of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. Coexpression of either rat gamma2 or gamma3, in combination with alpha1 and beta2 subunits, results both in receptors displaying high [3H]Ro 15-1788 affinity. However, receptors containing a gamma3 subunit display a 178-fold reduced affinity to zolpidem as compared with gamma2-containing receptors. Eight chimeras between gamma2 and gamma3 were constructed followed by nine different point mutations in gamma2, each to the homologous amino acid residue found in gamma3. Chimeric or mutant gamma subunits were coexpressed with alpha1 and beta2 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to localize amino acid residues responsible for the reduced zolpidem affinity. Substitution of a methionine-to-leucine at position 130 of gamma2 (gamma2M130L) resulted in a 51-fold reduction in zolpidem affinity whereas the affinity to [3H]Ro 15-1788 remained unchanged. The affinity for diazepam was only decreased by about 2-fold. The same mutation resulted in a 9-fold increase in Cl 218872 affinity. A second mutation (gamma2M57I) was found to reduce zolpidem affinity by about 4-fold. Wild-type and gamma2M130L-containing receptors were functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Upon mutation allosteric coupling between agonist and modulatory sites is preserved. Dose-response curves for zolpidem and for diazepam showed that the zolpidem but not the diazepam apparent affinity is drastically reduced. The apparent GABA affinity is not significantly affected by the gamma2M130L mutation. The identified amino acid residues may define part of the benzodiazepine binding pocket of GABAA receptors. As the modulatory site in the GABAA receptor is homologous to the GABA site, and to all agonist sites of related receptors, gamma2M130 may either point to a homologous region important for agonist binding in all receptors or define a new region not underlying this principle.", 
    "121": "Paroxetine is the first selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to be approved for the treatment of patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. It is a highly selective inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin reuptake and does not interact with adrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic or serotonergic receptors to any significant extent. Oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day is significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency of panic attacks and improving associated symptoms, as shown in short term trials in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. The efficacy of the drug was maintained during up to 6 months'; treatment, and continued therapy reduced the risk of relapse. Oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day was at least as effective as clomipramine 10 to 150 mg/day, but appeared to have a more rapid onset of effect, in a placebo-controlled trial. The tolerability profile of paroxetine is similar to that established for other SSRIs and is characterised by adverse events such as nausea, headache, somnolence, dry mouth, tremor, insomnia, asthenia, sweating, constipation, dizziness and sexual dysfunction. Paroxetine was better tolerated overall than clomipramine and was associated with a lower incidence of certain anticholinergic events (such as dry mouth and constipation) in a comparative trial. It is not associated with the type of dependence seen with benzodiazepines, and it appears to be safer in overdose than the tricyclic antidepressants. Paroxetine 20 or 30mg does not significantly impair psychomotor function or interact with alcohol (ethanol). In conclusion, the good tolerability profile of paroxetine, including lack of dependence potential and relative safety in overdose, makes it attractive for the treatment of patients with panic disorder. It appears to be at least as effective as clomipramine in reducing panic attacks and associated symptoms. Although further trials to compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine with that of other tricyclic agents (especially Imipramine), high-potency benzodiazepines and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are needed, the drug appears to have the potential to become a first-line treatment for panic disorder.", 
    "122": "Paroxetine increases serotonergic neurotransmission by inhibiting presynaptic reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and thereby increasing the level of the neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft. In vitro, it is a more potent inhibitor of serotonin uptake than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Citalopram, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine. Paroxetine was more potent than sertraline in one study that compared mean inhibition constants for serotonin uptake, but not in another study that compared the concentrations required to inhibit serotonin uptake by 50%. In contrast to the tricyclic antidepressants, paroxetine has little effect on the uptake of dopamine or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in vitro. It has negligible affinity for \u03b1r(1-), \u03b1r(2-) and \u03b2r-adrenoceptors, dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, hi starnine H(1) receptors and serotonin 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors. However, paroxetine does have weak affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors. As shown in rats, paroxetine appears to indirectly activate somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors when initially administered, thereby inhibiting firing of 5-HT neurons and release of serotonin. This may explain why the onset of therapeutic effect of paroxetine is delayed. However, repeated administration of paroxetine causes adaptive changes in synaptic serotonergic receptors, including a decrease in the responsiveness of somatodendritic and terminal serotonin autoreceptors. Central \u03b2r-adrenoceptors are not down-regulated by administration of paroxetine to rats. Various studies in healthy volunteers without sleep disorders or volunteers reporting poor sleep have indicated that paroxetine disturbs normal sleep patterns by reducing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and lengthening REM latency. The effect of paroxetine on sleep in patients with panic disorder has not been determined, but in patients with depression the drug improves subjective quality of sleep. In electroencephalographic studies in healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of paroxetine 30mg produced changes indicative of a sedative profile, whereas administration of 70mg produced changes indicative of activating properties. No significant impairment of psychomotor function was observed after administration of single or multiple doses of paroxetine 20 or 30mg to healthy volunteers or patients with depression. The sedation and impairment of psychomotor function caused by haloperidol, amobarbital, oxazepam or alcohol (ethanol) were not potentiated by the administration of paroxetine 30mg. In contrast to amitriptyline 150 mg/day or doxepin 150 mg/day, 2 to 6 weeks' treatment with paroxetine 20 or 30 mg/day did not produce clinically significant haemodynamic or electrophysiological effects on cardiac function in healthy volunteers or patients with depression. Fewer adverse cardiac effects were reported by paroxetine than nortriptyline recipients in a study in patients with depression and ischaemic heart disease. The anxiolytic activity of paroxetine has been demonstrated after 7 or 21 days' administration in several rodent models.", 
    "123": "Paroxetine is well absorbed after oral administration. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is rapidly distributed into tissue. Only about 1% of the paroxetine dose remains in the systemic circulation. Approximately 95% of paroxetine is protein bound in the plasma. Steady-state concentrations are reached after 7 to 14 days of oral administration and the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2\u03b2r) is approximately 24 hours. However, there is a great deal of interindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine. Paroxetine is metabolised by at least 2 enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, one of which is CYP2D6. This enzyme is subject to genetic polymorphism, and thus the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine differ between individuals who have the enzyme (extensive metabolisers) and those who do not (poor metabolisers). The metabolites of paroxetine are essentially inactive. Metabolism of paroxetine by CYP2D6 is saturable. Consequently, with repeated administration, bioavailability of paroxetine increases and pharmacokinetics may become nonlinear in some patients, especially when the dosage of paroxetine is increased. Approximately two-thirds of a paroxetine dose is eliminated in the urine and the remainder is excreted in faeces. Almost all of the dose is eliminated as metabolites; lt3% is excreted as unchanged drug. The plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of paroxetine are greater, and the t1/2\u03b2r prolonged, in elderly patients and those with hepatic or severe renal impairment compared with the general population. Paroxetine distributes into breast milk to produce concentrations similar to those in plasma.", 
    "124": "As shown in 3 short term placebo-controlled trials in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day is significantly more effective than placebo for most variables measuring reduction in panic attack frequency. The drug also produced significantly greater improvements in various anxiety and depression scales than placebo. An extension phase of one of the placebo-controlled studies showed that the efficacy of paroxetine in reducing panic attack frequency is maintained during up to 6 months' treatment and that the drug reduces the risk of relapse. Oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day was at least as effective as clomipramine 10 to 150 mg/day in a comparative study. During weeks 7 to 9 of treatment, 51% of paroxetine recipients had no full panic attacks, compared with 37% of clomipramine recipients. The onset of action appeared to be more rapid for paroxetine than for clomipramine. The 2 drugs were equally effective in improving generalised anxiety, phobic avoidance and social, family and work interactions. In patients who elected to continue treatment for a further 36 weeks in an extension phase of the above study, response rates increased further in all groups, including the placebo group. During weeks 34 to 36 of extended treatment, 85% of paroxetine recipients, 72% of clomipramine recipients and 59% of placebo recipients had no panic attacks. The difference between paroxetine and placebo was statistically significant at this time point; however, there was no significant difference between groups at the primary efficacy endpoint (weeks 22 to 24).", 
    "125": "Paroxetine is generally well tolerated by both younger and older individuals and its adverse event profile is consistent with that expected for an SSRI. The tolerability profile of paroxetine in patients with panic disorder appears to resemble that in patients with depression. Headache, nausea, somnolence, dry mouth and insomnia were the most common adverse events among 469 patients with panic disorder who received paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day in short term clinical trials. The individual incidences for these events ranged from 18 to 25%; however, the incidence of headache in paroxetine-treated patients was the same as that in placebo recipients. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)", 
    "126": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the brain. It is found in the highest levels in cortical and limbic structures and also in the basal ganglia. Two subtypes of CCK receptors have been described in the brain and gastrointestinal tissues. CCK(A) (alimentary subtype) receptors are mainly located in the gastrointestinal tract, regulating secretion of enzymes from the pancreas and emptying of the gallbladder. However, CCK(A) receptors are also found in several brain regions, with the highest densities in structures poorly protected by the haematoencephalic barrier (the area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarius and hypothalamus). The distribution of CCK(B) (brain subtype) receptors overlaps with the localisation of CCK and its mRNA in different brain areas, with the highest densities in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, nucleus accumbens and forebrain limbic structures.Both subtype of CCK receptor belong to the guanine nucleotide-binding protein-(G protein)-linked receptor superfamily containing 7 transmembrane domains. Signal transduction at CCK receptors is mediated via G(q) protein-related activation of phospholipase C and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). Recent cloning of CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptors has shown that mRNA for both receptors is distributed in the same tissues as established in radioligand binding and receptor autoradiography studies, with few exceptions.The existence of multiple CCK receptors has fuelled the development of selective CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptor antagonists. These antagonists belong to distinct chemical groups, including dibutyryl derivatives of cyclic nucleotides, amino acid derivatives, partial sequences and derivatives of the -COOH terminal sequence heptapeptides of CCK, benzodiazepine derivatives, 'peptoids' based on fragments of the CCK molecule, and pyrazolidinones. At the present time, the compounds of choice for blockade of the CCK(A) receptor are lorglumide, devazepide and lintitript (SR27897). L-365,260, CI-988, L-740,093 and LY288513 are the drugs most widely used to block CCK(B) receptors.Studies with CCK antagonists (and agonists) in animals and humans suggest a role for CCK in the regulation of anxiety and panic. The administration of CCK agonists [ceruletide (caerulein), CCK-4, pentagastrin] has an anxiogenic action in various animal models and in different animal species. However, the anxiogenic action of CCK agonists is restricted to nonconditioned (ethological) models of anxiety, with very limited activity in the 'classical' conditioned models. Pharmacological studies have revealed that CCK(B) receptors are the key targets in the anxiogenic action of CCK agonists. Nevertheless, CCK(B) antagonists displayed very little activity, if any at all, in these models, but strongly antagonised the effects of CCK(B) agonists. The anxiogenic/panicogenic action of CCK(B) agonists (CCK-4, pentagastrin) is even more pronounced in human studies, but the effectiveness of CCK(B) antagonists as anxiolytics remains unclear. Clinical trials performed to date have provided inconclusive data about the anxiolytic potential of CCK(B) receptor antagonists, probably because of limiting pharmacokinetic factors.The results of some animal experiments suggest a role for CCK in depression. The administration of CCK(B) antagonists causes antidepressant-like action in mouse models of depression. However, human studies replicating this result have yet to be carried out.A prominent biochemical alteration in schizophrenia is a reduction of CCK levels in the cerebral cortex. This change may be related to the loss of cortical neurons, due to the schizophrenic process itself. In animal studies (mainly in mice), administration of CCK agonists and antagonists has been shown to be effective in several models, reflecting a possible antipsychotic activity of these drugs. However, the data obtained in human studies suggest that CCK agonists and antagonists do not improve the symptoms of schizophrenia. Taking into account the reduced levels of CCK and its receptors found in schizophrenia, treatments increasing, but not blocking, brain CCK activity may be more appropriate.", 
    "127": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that can complicate acute and chronic liver disease. Recent research has focused on the role benzodiazepine-like substances play in the pathogenesis of this disorder. It has been proposed that potentiation of the action of the neuroinhibitory transmitter \u03b3r-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through the binding of endogenous benzodiazepine agonists to the benzodiazepine receptor binding site accounts for the clinical and biochemical features of this condition.Increased levels of endogenous benzodiazepine-like substances have been noted in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy. In human studies, levels of these substances of up to 10 times those found in the body fluids of nonencephalopathic controls have been reported. The existence of such markedly elevated levels cannot be satisfactorily explained with reference to possible pharmaceutical or dietary origins.Further support for the role of benzodiazepines in the mediation of hepatic encephalopathy comes from the therapeutic effect reported after administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. Improvements in the severity of hepatic encephalopathy have been documented in rats with fulminant hepatic failure given flumazenil, although results have been inconsistent according to the dose of flumazenil used and the procedure employed to induce the encephalopathy. Transient, but distinct, improvements in the grade of hepatic encephalopathy have also been documented in several human studies. In a placebo-controlled study involving patients with mild hepatic encephalopathy, a low dose of flumazenil (0.2 mg/kg) resulted in a significant improvement in reaction time.Research now needs to identify whether the beneficial effect of flumazenil is due to its antagonistic or inverse agonistic properties, and also to clarify the mechanisms by which the differential response to the drug in animal models of fulminant hepatic failure is mediated.", 
    "128": "In a previous study using Sprague-Dawley rats, we showed that in a prepulse inhibition (PPI) procedure with levels of PPI ranging from approximately 10 to 40% (for prepulse intensities 2, 9 and 15 dB above background noise), the antipsychotics clozapine and haloperidol, but also the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, robustly and dose-dependently potentiated PPI. In contrast, the antipsychotics risperidone, amisulpride, raclopride and remoxipride did not potentiate PPI. The false positive (prazosin) and the four false negatives led us to conclude that this PPI-enhancing procedure had poor predictive validity as a screening tool for potential antipsychotics. In the present study, we used Wistar rats, which under the same protocol as that used for Sprague-Dawley rats show a very low level of PPI. We examined the ability of six antipsychotics, given intraperitoneally (i.p.), to reverse this PPI deficit. It was found that clozapine (5-20 mg/kg), olanzapine (5-20 mg/kg) and sertindole (1-10 mg/kg) reversed this deficiency of PPI (i.e. potentiated the low level of PPI). In contrast, risperidone (0.1-1 mg/kg), remoxipride (1-10 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.1-1 mg/kg) were inactive. The negative results with three clinically active antipsychotics (risperidone, remoxipride and haloperidol) indicate that reversal of this PPI deficit in Wistar rats has poor predictive validity to screen for potential antipsychotic activity. In an attempt to investigate the mechanism that might underlie the reversing effect of clozapine, olanzapine and sertindole, we tested the ability of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (3-20 mg/kg), the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) and the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin (0.3-3 mg/kg) to reverse the PPI deficit. Negative results with these three drugs did not allow us to characterize the receptor(s) that might be implicated in the reversal of this type of PPI deficit."
