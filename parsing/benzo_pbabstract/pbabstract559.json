In the cat brotizolam and triazolam increased the time asleep. With diazepam, sleep enhancement could be observed only within a very limited period. After nitrazepam and flurazepam sleep was decreased. REM-sleep was not changed with 0.1 mg/kg brotizolam, slightly reduced after 0.3 and moderately shortened with 1 mg/kg. After triazolam REM-sleep was reduced to a higher degree than after brotizolam. The experiments show, that brotizolam has sleep-inducing properties in the cat and is in this respect different from other diazepine derivatives.", 
    "1": "Of a series of azepines annelated with two 5-ring heterocycles, 1, brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941), 2, was found to possess excellent hypnotic properties. A summary of the two different methods of preparation of 2 (routes A and B) is given. Synthesis of the major metabolites of 2, 6-hydroxy-brotizolam (We 1061), 14, obtained from the intermediates 9 and 10 by method B, 2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-hydroxymethyl-6H-thieno [3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo-[4,3a]-1,4-diazepine (WE 964), 16, and 2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-6-hydroxy-9-hydroxymethyl-6H-thieno- [3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo-[4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine (We 1073), 17, are described in detail. In contrast to the classical 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepines, e.g. oxazepam, 14 isomerizes easily in weak alkali. This isomerization is discussed.", 
    "2": "For patients dependent on benzodiazepines alone, or in combination with alcohol and/or other legal and illegal drugs, observed mortality rates were compared with the average population, and, in cases of isolated benzodiazepine dependence, also with a control group of non-dependent patients chosen to match each dependent not only in sex and date of birth, but also in pre-existing psychiatric illness besides dependence. For patients with an isolated benzodiazepine dependence, the mortality rate was increased, when compared with the average population, by a ratio of observed to expected numbers of deaths of about 3. However, this mortality rate did not differ from that of the control group (non-dependent patients with comparable psychiatric illnesses). For patients combining benzodiazepines with alcohol among other addictive drugs, and for patients combining benzodiazepines with illegal drugs among other addictive substances, the ratio of observed to excepted numbers of deaths was 6.2 resp. 21, thus corresponding well with other studies on mortality rates associated with alcoholism and dependence on illegal drugs. We conclude that our study does not give evidence of higher risk of early death correlated with dependence on benzodiazepines alone. However, it confirms the well-known fact of increased mortality rates in patients with psychiatric illnesses, especially with dependence on alcohol or illegal drugs.", 
    "3": "Eighteen healthy volunteers of both sexes, aged 20-34, were tested in the morning while undertaking real car driving avoidance manoeuvres and during monotonous simulated driving after 1 and 3 nights of medication with triazolam 0.25 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg or placebo. The study was a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, where a minimum of 7 days wash-out separated the 3 treatment periods. Nitrazepam was found to impair performance in the simulated task after 1 but not after 3 nights of medication. Performance in the triazolam condition was not significantly different from the other conditions on this task on either day. However, after one night of medication triazolam tended to score worse than placebo but better than nitrazepam. In real car driving a tendency was noted for nitrazepam to score worst, whereas the difference between placebo and triazolam was hardly noticeable. The same tendency appeared on both days.", 
    "4": "The effect of graded doses of the new antimuscarinic agent telenzepine on human gastric secretion has been studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in nine healthy volunteers. Over a period of 60 minutes basal acid output as well as acid response to sham feeding was examined. Telenzepine reduced dose-dependently basal acid secretion: This parameter was inhibited with 1 mg by 2%, with 2 mg by 37%, with 3 mg by 53% and with 5 mg by 76%, respectively. The corresponding values for stimulated acid secretion were 16%, 34%, 40% and 57%, respectively. The reduction of basal and stimulated acid secretion was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) following the two larger telenzepine doses. Production of saliva was inhibited by 9%, 21%, 28% and 48%, respectively. The latter reaching statistical significance (p less than 0.05).", 
    "5": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate 5.0 mg/kg morphine from saline. After morphine, subjects tracked the location of red response keys and after saline, the location of green keys. When stimulus generalization to other drugs was investigated dl-methadone produced morphine-like responding and this response generalization was primarily due to the l-isomer. Pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg naloxone shifted the morphine generalization curve 10-fold to the right but only shifted the rate suppression curve 3-fold to the right. dl-Cyclazocine generated dose-related increases in responding on the red key location and in 3 of 5 birds, responses after 1.0 mg/kg were indistinguishable from those after morphine training doses. Meperidine did not produce responding on the red keys, nor did diazepam, cocaine, d-amphetamine, phencyclidine or pentobarbital. The discriminative stimulus effects of morphine are thus stereo-selective and pharmacologically specific. Generalization of responding to dl-cyclazocine but not to phencyclidine suggests that the morphine-like discriminative dl-cyclazocine cue was not due to interaction at sigma opiate receptors.", 
    "6": "Chronic diazepam treatment (5 mg/kg intragastrically, twice daily for 14 days) did not influence either hypothalamic, midbrain or cortical histamine (HA) levels or histidine decarboxylase (HD) activity in male Sprague-Dawley (200-220 g) rats. However, a small but significant decrease in hypothalamic HA concentration and significantly increased HD activity was seen following diazepam withdrawal. Air blast stress induced a significant elevation in hypothalamic HA levels and HD activity in vehicle-treated controls, diazepam-treated and diazepam-withdrawn rats, but the change in HD activity was significantly greater in the last group. The latter group also displayed the greatest elevation in plasma corticosterone levels in response to stress. Hence, diazepam withdrawal in rats results in some changes in the basal hypothalamic HA regulation and may influence the hypothalamic HA and corticosterone response to stress.", 
    "7": "Single doses of d-amphetamine, chlorpheniramine or diazepam were combined with ethanol under two conditions: (i) in drug-naive mice and (ii) in mice which had been given a single dose of ethanol 72 hr previously. Ethanol was administered orally at doses of 6.0, 3.0 or 1.5 g/kg; doses of d-amphetamine, chlorpheniramine or diazepam were given intraperitoneally. Three parameters were measured; changes in rectal temperature, forced motor coordination, as evaluated by rotarod performance and concentrations of ethanol in blood. d-Amphetamine and chlorpheniramine attenuated the hypothermia induced by ethanol but had no effect on the motor-impairing effect of ethanol. Hypothermia induced by diazepam was unaffected by ethanol, but the combination appeared to impair maximally rotarod performance. Concentrations of ethanol in blood did not differ between ethanol-naive mice and mice which had received the same dose of ethanol 72 hr previously. Changes in body temperature and intoxication have been attributed to central actions of ethanol; however, the differential results obtained from the interactions between these drugs suggest differing sensitivities of the various systems which are affected by ethanol.", 
    "8": "Liver microsomal 7-alkoxycoumarin O-dealkylase activities in rats were stimulated by the administration of large doses of 5-[(2-aminoacetamide)methyl]-1-[4-chloro-2-(o-chlorobenzoyl)phenyl ]-N, N-dimethyl-1 H-s-triazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride dihydrate (450191-S), a new sleep inducer which is a 1H-1,2,4-triazolyl benzophenone derivative. To obtain the correlation between the stimulation or induction of hepatic enzymes and the plasma level of the metabolites of 450191-S, various amounts of 450191-S were administered orally to rats and the metabolites in plasma were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Plasma concentration-time profiles for metabolites in rats showed the appearance of metabolites in plasma followed by their rapid disappearance from blood when the animals received non-inducing amounts of 450191-S. On the other hand, the profiles of metabolites in rats administered higher amounts of the drug showed very high plasma concentrations of metabolites, especially 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-2-carboxamide (M-2) and 8-chloro-6-(2- chlorophenyl)-N-hydroxymethyl-4H-1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-2-carboxamide (M-A), which were maintained for a long time with slow elimination. These results led to the conclusion that the induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes is closely correlated with the high plasma concentrations of metabolites and their prolonged existence in plasma.", 
    "9": "Thirteen patients with good left ventricular function undergoing coronary artery revascularization were studied to determine the cardiovascular effects of verapamil, 75-150 micrograms X kg-1, after a large dose (100 micrograms X kg-1) of fentanyl, with pancuronium for muscle relaxation. The patients were continued on their usual cardiovascular medications until the time of surgery, which included nitrates, beta adrenergic blockers, and nifedipine. Anaesthesia with fentanyl was associated with decreases in mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular stroke work index, and circulating catecholamine levels. Mean values were not further changed by verapamil, but individual patients had additional modest decreases in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac index, however, was well maintained. Plasma catecholamines remained depressed after verapamil under the study condition. Thus, in patients with good left ventricular function, clinically relevant doses of verapamil were well tolerated even in the presence of an anaesthetic that included large doses of fentanyl, with suppression of circulating catecholamine levels.", 
    "10": "5-[(2- Aminoacetamide)methyl]-1-[p-chloro-2-(o-chlorobenzoyl)phenyl]- N,N-dimethyl-1 H-s-triazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride dihydrate (450191-S) is a newly synthesized sleep inducer, which itself has negligible affinities for benzodiazepine receptors. However, several active metabolites have been found in rat plasma. In this paper, the mechanisms and contribution of the activation of 450191-S in rat small intestine were investigated. When 450191-S was incubated with rat everted small intestine, desglycylated 450191-S (191 DG) was released in the medium and subsequently converted to 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-4H-1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-2-carboxamide (M-1). The results obtained using synthetic 191DG indicated that the conversion of 191DG to M-1 was spontaneous and very rapid, with a half-life of 9 min in pH 7.4 buffer. After incubation, the intestinal tissue contained a small amount of unchanged 450191-S but large amounts of 191DG and/or M-1. Next, metabolites in the mesenteric blood were determined following instillation of 14C-450191-S into a segment of rat ileum and it was found that almost all of the radioactivity in the blood was accounted for by 191DG and/or M-1. In conclusion, 450191-S is metabolized by intestinal aminopeptidases to 191DG, which is spontaneously converted to M-1, an active metabolite, and the activation is completed by a single passage through the intestinal wall.", 
    "11": "The binding of pirenzepine, a selective muscarinic receptor antagonist to plasma and bile, was studied in vitro and in vivo. Plasma and hepatic bile were incubated with 14C-pirenzepine and the bound fraction of 14C-pirenzepine determined by equilibrium dialysis. The bound fractions were 12.6% (s.e.m. = 1.5) and 12.1% (s.e.m. = 1.6) in plasma and bile samples, respectively. After in vitro incubation, the radioactivity in both plasma and bile was removed by exhaustive dialysis against water for up to 94 h, suggesting that the binding was a noncovalent association. 14C-Pirenzepine was also given intravenously to five postoperative patients with T-tube drainage of hepatic bile. In plasma, 12.6% (s.e.m. = 1.8) of 14C-pirenzepine was reversibly bound to albumin. By contrast, in bile 13.4% (s.e.m. = 3.2) was irreversibly bound, mainly to bilirubin glucuronides (greater than 90%). After an intravenous injection of 14C-pirenzepine, the radioactivity in plasma decreased bi-exponentially with an initial distribution half-life of 0.24 h and an elimination half-life of 10.2 h. The radioactivity reappeared cyclically in bile, suggesting enterohepatic recirculation of 14C-pirenzepine.", 
    "12": "A derivative of the 1,4-benzodiazepine series with reported opioid activity was evaluated in regard to its effect on central nervous activity in the awake canine. Additionally a possible benzodiazepine- or opioid-receptor interaction was evaluated by using specific antagonists. In 10 experiments increasing doses of tifluadom (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 micrograms/kg) modified somato-sensory-evoked potentials (SEP) inducing a dose-related latency change (40-80 micrograms/kg) and a suppression (80 micrograms/kg) of the P50-peak. Both effects are interpreted as a modification of stimuli reaching the somatosensory cortex. EEG-spectral analysis was characterized by a dose-related decrease of power in the higher frequency range (13-40 Hz) accompanied by an increase of power in the lower band (0.5-3.5 Hz). This effect was paralleled by deep sedation. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (240 micrograms/kg) was ineffective in reversing central nervous EEG- and SEP-changes. Naloxone (20 micrograms/kg) induced a short-term (5 min) arousal and a partial reversal of SEP-changes. The specific opioid-kappa-antagonist Mr 2266 (20 micrograms/kg) however, induced a long lasting return of power spectra and SEP-changes back to control. This results suggest that tifluadom, although being structurally a benzodiazepine, interacts with an opioid sub-receptor of the kappa-type, which is known to induce sedation and supraspinal analgesia without respiratory depression.", 
    "13": "The efficacy of second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was evaluated in the treatment of 66 patients with complex partial seizures who had previously failed first-line AEDs. Methsuximide, valproate, or clorazepate had eliminated seizures in 11% of the patients at the end of the study. However, these good results deteriorated on longer follow-up and were not expected to be permanent. It is recommended that suitable patients with partial epilepsy be referred for surgical evaluation after failing the first-line AEDs, and that second-line AEDs be reserved for nonsurgical candidates.", 
    "14": "In conscious animals, the intravenous administration of enkephalins increases heart rate (HR) and mean systemic arterial blood pressure (MAP); however, when given during barbiturate anesthesia, enkephalins reduce HR and MAP. We have investigated the potential role of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) complex (consisting of chloride-ion channel and binding sites for GABA, benzodiazepine, and barbiturate/picrotoxin) as the site of modulation of enkephalin responses by certain anesthetic agents in our chronically instrumented dog model. In our model, methionine-enkephalin (Met5-ENK) (35 micrograms/kg intravenously) increased HR and MAP, but following induction of general anesthesia with barbiturate (pentobarbital) or of sedation with benzodiazepine (diazepam), Met5-ENK produced vasodepressor responses despite differing levels of consciousness in the treated animals. Subsequent administration of picrotoxin restored pressor responses to Met5-ENK in the barbiturate-treated dogs, but not in those treated with benzodiazepine; picrotoxin did not alter the level of consciousness. Picrotoxin had no effect upon Met5-ENK responses in the conscious state. In contrast, alpha-chloralose, a convulsive anesthetic agent which does not appear to alter GABA complex activity, blunted but did not reverse pressor responses to Met5-ENK, despite causing a level of anesthesia similar to that produced by barbiturate. The observed pressor response to Met5-ENK during alpha-chloralose anesthesia was totally inhibited by naloxone, indicating that this response was still mediated by opiate receptors. Our data are compatible with modulation of enkephalin responses by GABA complex activity. Systemic enkephalins may generate afferent signals which may subsequently undergo GABA complex processing; the state of activation of the GABA complex may then determine whether systemic enkephalin signals are translated as vasopressor or vasodepressor responses.", 
    "15": "Brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin) is a newly developed thienotriazolo-diazepine with distinct hypnotic effects. It was biochemically characterized by performing various receptor binding studies, uptake and release studies in vitro and determining homovanillic acid brain concentrations in vivo. Using [3H]-flunitrazepam as a radioligand, brotizolam showed an extremely high affinity for specific benzodiazepine binding sites in the rat brain, demonstrated by an IC50 value of 1.0 nmol/l. Using both [3H]-flunitrazepam and [3H]-brotizolam as radioligands, a strong correlation between the IC50 values of brotizolam and various benzodiazepines could be shown. [3H]-Flunitrazepam as well as [3H]-brotizolam bound with similar affinities to cerebellar and hippocampal synaptosomal membranes. In contrast to [3H]-flunitrazepam binding, however, [3H]-brotizolam had twice the number of specific binding sites in the hippocampus. According to the maximum binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam, the inhibition curve of brotizolam also increased in the presence of 10(-4) mol/l gamma-aminobutyric acid and decreased remarkably in the presence of 10(-4) mol/l bicuculline. Using [3H]-muscimol as a ligand, a modulating effect of brotizolam could be shown by increasing the low affinity with no change in the number of binding sites. From various further receptor binding studies, as well as from in vitro uptake and release studies of [3H]-noradrenaline, [3H]-serotonin and [3H]-dopamine, no indication was found of another biochemical effect of brotizolam. There was also no change in the homovanillic acid concentration in the rat brain striata in vivo after brotizolam treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The influence of apomorphine, levodopa and haloperidol was studied on nitrazepam sleep using young chicks and rats. In addition, the influence of dopamine and ADTN was studied in young chicks. Nitrazepam dose-dependently (0.4-51.2 mg/kg, i.p.) induced behavioural sleep in chicks. However, higher doses of nitrazepam (12.8-51.2 mg/kg, i.p.) were required to induce behavioural sleep in rats. Dopamine (12.5-100 mg/kg, i.p.) and ADTN (2.5-80 mg/kg, i.p.) delayed the onset but prolonged nitrazepam sleep in chicks: these effects were statistically significant. Levodopa (12.5-100 mg/kg, s.c.) and apomorphine (0.2-0.8 mg/kg, s.c.) profoundly delayed the onset and shortened the duration of nitrazepam sleep in both chicks and rats. Noradrenaline (20-80 mg/kg, i.p.) shortened the onset and prolonged nitrazepam sleep in chicks. Pimozide (1-8 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated nitrazepam sleep and antagonized the effects of dopamine, levodopa and ADTN on nitrazepam sleep in chicks. Similarly, haloperidol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated nitrazepam sleep and antagonized the effects of levodopa and apomorphine on nitrazepam sleep in rats. The EEG synchronization and decreased EMG induced by nitrazepam (1.6 mg/kg, i.p., and 12.8 mg/kg, i.p., for chicks and rats, respectively) were antagonized by levodopa (12.5 mg/kg, s.c.). The behavioural and electroencephalographical results suggest that enhancement of dopaminergic neurotransmission may be involved in the mechanisms of wakefulness in both chicks and rats.", 
    "17": "The effect of lesioning noradrenergic pathways on the benzodiazepine receptor has been studied using a novel neurotoxic agent, N(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) which has better selectivity than the classical 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) towards noradrenergic neurones, and which has the added advantage of being injected systemically rather than intracerebrally. Three different radioligands were used: an agonist, [3H]flunitrazepam, an antagonist, [3H]Ro 15-1788, and a partial agonist [3H]RU 43028. Binding was measured using membrane homogenates from the cortex and hippocampus of the rat, two regions of the brain which receive an extensive noradrenergic innervation. In contrast to previous reports of a decrease in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam following lesioning with 6-OHDA, no significant change was observed in either the affinity (KD) or the number of sites (Bmax) of any one of these ligands after lesioning with DSP4. While the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear, these results do not confirm that destruction of noradrenergic afferents to the cortex or hippocampus leads to any modification of the benzodiazepine receptor as demonstrated by ligand binding.", 
    "18": "The ability to photolabel benzodiazepine receptors from various regions of the rat brain with 3H-flunitrazepam has allowed for the structural examination of these receptors by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Results for all regions studied revealed the labeled receptor to consist of a single major band of radioactivity with the apparent molecular weight of approximately 50,000. Under our conditions of labeling we do not significantly label any higher molecular weight forms of the receptor. Exposure of the benzo-diazepine receptors to either of the glycosidases neuraminidase (N) and endoglycosidase-H (E) results in the specific removal of sialic acids and complete asparagine-linked carbohydrate moieties, respectively. This type of structural modification of the receptor resulted in an apparent decrease in the molecular weight, as determined by increased mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, for all regions examined (cortex + N + E, 8,000-10,000; hippocampus + N, 7,000, + E, 12,000; cerebellum + N, none, + E, 4,000). These results point to a heterogeneity in the posttranslational glycosylation of the benzodiazepine receptor that may be due to brain region-specific differences in glycosylation. The removal of these carbohydrate moieties alters the binding of agonists and antagonists to the benzodiazepine receptor. Cortical agonist binding following either glycosidase treatment resulted in no apparent shift in the Kd but a significant decrease in the Bmax. The Bmax change may be the result of a large decrease in affinity or denaturation of a subpopulation of benzodiazepine receptors. Antagonist binding also showed no apparent Kd shift but a significant increase in the Bmax. The increase may have resulted from the activation of \"hidden\" benzodiazepine receptors or a shift of low affinity sites to sites of higher affinity. Cerebellar agonist or antagonist binding was not altered, in terms of either Kd or Bmax, by either enzyme treatment, correlating well with the small amount of carbohydrate removal seen following such treatments. The ability of these enzymes to modify the apparent molecular weight of the benzodiazepine receptors and the strong correlation to altered ligand binding, in a regional specific manner, generally parallel the description given of type 1 and type 2 benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "19": "(-)-[3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding to muscarinic receptors on intact mouse pituitary tumor cells (AtT-20/D16-16) was characterized in an attempt to correlate radioligand binding properties with receptor-coupled biochemical responses. Performing rinse time studies for 2 hr produced a remarkably improved ratio of specific/total (+)-[3H]QNB binding (85%). Kinetic experiments yielded association (k+1) and dissociation (k-1) rate constants of 2.2 X 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 6.8 X 10(-3) min-1, respectively. Receptor occupancy curves demonstrated a uniform population of specific, saturable (-)-[3H]QNB binding sites with a Hill coefficient equal to 1.0 and an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) equal to 34 pM under our conditions. Stereoselectivity was observed with the enantiomers (dexetimide and levetimide) of benzetimide (a factor of 4300). Concentrations of carbachol that produced a half-maximal inhibition of cyclic AMP formation and a concentration of carbachol for producing half-maximal stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover in the intact cells were 0.45 and 170 microM, respectively. Schild analysis revealed that pirenzepine, a nonclassical muscarinic antagonist, had a 40-fold greater affinity for reversing carbachol-stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover (inhibition constant or Ki = 7 nM), compared to its antagonism of the carbachol-mediated inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP formation (Ki = 280 nM). Interestingly, pirenzepine inhibited (-)-[3H]QNB binding with a Ki value of 72 nM. In contrast, atropine was nearly equipotent (Ki = 0.3-0.5 nM) in binding studies and in both effector systems.", 
    "20": "Autoradiography utilizing photoaffinity labelling with [3H]flunitrazepam was used in living cultures of fetal mouse cerebral cortex in situ to localize benzodiazepine receptor binding sites. There was a predominant localization of silver grains over neurons; however, substantial labelling also occurred over nonneuronal background cells. Clonazepam (0.1 microM) and Ro 5-4864 (0.1 microM) displaced substantial numbers of silver grains over neurons and background cells, respectively. In addition, clonazepam displaced 58-68% of specific grains over background cells and Ro 5-4864 displaced 30% of grains over neurons, suggesting that multiple cell types in the CNS may participate in the neuropharmacologic actions of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "21": "The effects of preincubating cerebral cortical membranes with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) were examined on radioligand binding to benzodiazepine receptors of the \"central\" and \"peripheral\" types. PLA2 (0.005-0.1 U/ml) increased [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline binding by increasing the apparent affinities of these ligands with no concomitant change in the maximum number of binding sites. In contrast, neither gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding nor [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding was altered by preincubation with PLA2 at concentrations as high as 2 U/ml. Both pyrazolopyridine (SQ 65,396)- and barbiturate (pentobarbital)-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding were markedly reduced by as little as 0.0025-0.005 U/ml of PLA2. These findings suggest that PLA2 inactivates the TBPS binding site on the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex, which results in a selective loss of allosteric \"regulation\" between the components of this complex. PLA2 also reduced the apparent affinity of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in cerebral cortical, heart, and kidney membranes, but increased the number of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites with no change in apparent affinity. These data demonstrate that PLA2 can differentially affect the lipid microenvironment of \"central\" and \"peripheral\" types of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "22": "The presence of specific benzodiazepine binding sites in the hearts of dogs and human beings was demonstrated in vivo by a noninvasive method, positron emission tomography (PET). An antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, PK 11195, was labeled with carbon-11, a short-lived positron emitter. When injected at high specific activity, 11C-PK 11195 was concentrated in the myocardium. As increasing amounts of unlabeled PK 11195 were added to the radioactive ligand, the myocardial ligand concentration was proportional to myocardial regional perfusion up to quantities of 40 nmol/kg body weight. Above 40 nmol/kg the ligand concentration reached a maximum value (6000 pmol/cm3), which could be considered as the total number of binding sites per unit heart volume. The specificity of 11C-PK 11195 binding to canine heart was demonstrated from a study on the inhibition of binding for radioligand by an excess of several agonists or antagonists of benzodiazepine receptor. The distribution and specificity of 11C-PK 11195 was similar in dogs and in human beings. PET thus opens the way to the investigation of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in a clinical situation, since it has recently been shown that this receptor could be coupled to the calcium channel in the heart.", 
    "23": "In a randomized, double-blind study of premedication in 69 infants aged between 13 and 48 months the effects of 0.82 mg/kg midazolam or diazepam rectally plus 2.0 mg/kg ketamine i.m., or the administration of 2.4 mg/kg ketamine i.m. alone was studied. A satisfying result of 94.1% following the premedication with midazolam/ketamine, of 82.9% with diazepam/ketamine and of 81.3% with ketamine alone was observed. Premedication with midazolam/ketamine was the best one in the review of vigilance, agitation, and behaviour of defence against the mask at the beginning of anaesthesia. The amnestic action of midazolam extinguished the infants' memory of the i.m.-injection. The dose of midazolam/ketamine is suitable as an effective and positive method for premedication of infants within 20 min.", 
    "24": "This report describes a highly sensitive capillary gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric procedure for the quantification of alprazolam in human plasma. Alprazolam was extracted from plasma at basic pH with benzeneisoamyl alcohol (98:2, v/v) and analysed directly without any derivatization. Triazolam, also a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, was used as an internal standard because its extraction characteristics were similar to alprazolam. High sensitivity was achieved by negative ion chemical ionization and selected ion monitoring for alprazolam (m/z 308) and triazolam (m/z 306). The within-day coefficient of variation of the method over the concentration range 1.0-20 ng alprazolam per ml of plasma was 5.5%.", 
    "25": "In a double-blind trial, 50 patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 0.29 mg/kg diazepam (Valium 5 mg/ml) or 0.14 mg/kg of midazolam (midazolam hydrochloride 5 mg/ml) intravenously at a first session of conservative dentistry, the alternative being administered at the second session. Good operating conditions were reported under each sedative and no important physiological differences were observed. Most patients failed to return to 'street fitness' 30 minutes after either session of treatment. Previous reports of reduced incidence of venous thrombophlebitis with midazolam were not convincingly confirmed in this trial, but data quality was poor. For about half the patients, the amnesic effect was stronger following midazolam.", 
    "26": "The effect of midazolam, for induction of anaesthesia, on the glycaemic and adrenocortical responses to lower pelvic surgery in female patients has been studied and compared with a comparable group of patients receiving thiopentone. Although midazolam has been shown to obtund adrenaline and noradrenaline release to electrical or surgical stress in the rat and dog, there was no blunting of the glycaemic response to surgery in man. Plasma cortisol levels in response to surgery and anaesthesia were comparable in the two groups of patients.", 
    "27": "The pharmacological profile of chlordesmethyldiazepam was studied in mice and compared with that of other benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, flunitrazepam, medazepam and chlordiazepoxide). All the drugs were administered perorally and their anticonvulsive activity (antagonism towards pentetrazole-induced clonic convulsions), anxiolytic action (the four-plate test), myorelaxant activity (the rota-rod test), sedative effect (inhibition of the locomotor activity) and neurotoxic effect (abolition of the righting reflex) were estimated. Chlordesmethyldiazepam revealed an anticonvulsive action (ED50 = 0.11 mg/kg), anxiolytic activity (MED = 2 mg/kg), myorelaxant action (ED50 = 17.5 mg/kg), sedative effect (ED50 = 34 mg/kg) and neurotoxic action (NTD50 = 190 mg/kg). Considering the potency of action (ED50) in respective tests and the therapeutic indices (NTD50/ED50 ratio), chlordesmethyldiazepam in respect of its profile resembles most lorazepam and diazepam.", 
    "28": "The neuroreceptors in the brain are the targets of transmitters and drugs. Tritiated ligands - mostly selective antagonists - allowed to characterize the dopamine, serotonin and adrenergic receptors in human brain. Their properties were compared to those of rat brain receptors. Our results confirm the high affinity of several antagonist drugs for the corresponding binding sites in human brain. D2 dopamine receptors were identified in the striatum. S2 serotonergic receptors were located mainly in the cerebral cortex and their binding properties in solubilized form did not differ from those of the rat brain solubilized receptors. Adrenergic receptors were located either in cortical and subcortical areas. The subregional study indicates that wide variations could occur between adjacent areas of the cortex and between the different cortical layers. The subcellular distribution of several receptors revealed a main synaptosomal localization in human brain in contrast to other species. The S2 serotonergic receptors, the substance P peptide receptors and the benzodiazepine receptors were studied in the brain of Parkinsonian patients. The results were compared with those obtained in other neurological illnesses. A decrease in receptor number often corresponds to neuronal cell loss in degenerative diseases.", 
    "29": "Theta/alpha spectral powers ratio was used to quantify physiological decrease of vigilance occurring after 5 min recording eyes closed, at different times of the day, in normal volunteers with 'high alpha'. Maximum decrease of vigilance occurred at about 2 or 4 p.m. Theta/alpha ratio fluctuations were similar on the homologous right and left scalp areas. This ratio is useful in psychopharmacology to quantify the antagonist activity of a CNS stimulant drug on the physiological decrease of vigilance after 5 min as well as the sedative effect of a drug. It allows to follow the kinetics of the drug action at receptor level.", 
    "30": "In a detailed analysis of the effects of depression on a broad range of social, marital, vocational adjustment and leisure time activities in 176 outpatients with mild to moderate depressions, major disturbances were seen in all areas of functioning. These disturbances were most pronounced in the areas of work and social leisure. Except for continued impairment in leisure, these disturbances were considerably attenuated in those patients who were at a mild or asymptomatic level of depression at the time of comparison. These data suggest that functions which depend on traditional roles in family or at work tend to oscillate with the level of depression, whereas functions that require personal initiative (e.g. leisure) may remain abnormal well into the interepisodic phase. The reported disturbances were especially marked in dysthymic or chronic depressives who seem to suffer from the long-term effects of depression.", 
    "31": "The inhibitory influence on respiratory functions is clinically an important attribute of the diazepine drugs. This unwanted side effect is frequently observed with intravenous administration in anesthesiology. It is difficult to demonstrate when taken orally, however, of equal clinical relevance, e.g. in elderly people, in patients with obstructive airways diseases, and eventually also in healthy subjects, when diazepine are given for sleep improvement. In the present study, three diazepines, brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno [3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin), triazolam and flunitrazepam, which can be used as soporifics, are investigated comparatively in respect to their effect on respiration in anesthetized cats, using intravenous administration. For all three drugs, a marked toxic interaction was found with chloralose/urethane anesthesia, and noticeably less distinctive with pentobarbital anesthesia. This toxicity increased in quantity with the sequence brotizolam less than triazolam less than flunitrazepam. After repeated injections of equal or increasing doses, a pronounced tachyphylaxia was noted, whereby the tolerance against the toxic actions on respiration commenced already after the first injection. In case of flunitrazepam, however, was this tachyphylaxia clearly less prominent. Recently, similar results with diazepines were reported by several other authors. The various effects of diazepines on respiration and their conceivable mechanism of action are briefly discussed, and the relevance of the results in this context is evaluated.", 
    "32": "Brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f]-1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-a]-1,4-diazepine, We 941, Lendormin) is a thienotriazolo diazepine with predominantly sleep-inducing properties. Additionally, brotizolam, attenuated conflict behavior in rats and inhibited aggressive behavior in mice and cats. Brotizolam prevented audiogenic seizures in mice, seizures provoked by electroshock in rats and inhibited convulsions elicited by electrical stimulation in the limbic system of cats. Furthermore, brotizolam antagonized seizures induced by the convulsant drugs pentetrazol, bicuculline and strychnine in mice. Motocoordination was not impaired within the effective dose range. Muscle relaxant effects appeared at higher doses only. The onset of effect of brotizolam occurred in the different experiments within 15-30 min, thus indicating a fast enteral absorption and penetration of the blood-brain barrier. The duration of action within the therapeutic dose range was between 2-6 h. The effect of brotizolam was compared with other diazepine derivatives. Brotizolam was more active than diazepam, nitrazepam, estazolam, flurazepam and clonazepam and nearly as active as triazolam.", 
    "33": "It is well established that intracerebral injections of kainic acid may cause not only neuronal cell destruction at the injection site, but also losses in some distant regions. The mechanisms are different. The distant, but not the local, destruction can be produced by folic as well as by kainic acid and prevented by pretreatment of the animal with diazepam. Overexcitation of excitatory projections is believed responsible for the distant damage and evidence is presented that in some instances the projections involved are cholinergic. Thus, for example, injections of kainic acid or folic acid into the substantia innominata of rats destroy neurons in areas such as the pyriform cortex and amygdala which receive cholinergic projections from the injected area. Some of the destroyed neurons are GABAergic. That the distant toxicity in these areas can be partially blocked by scopolamine and is accompanied by decreases in the number of muscarinic binding sites is consistent with a cholinergic mechanism. Distant damage also occurs in the thalamus but this appears to be mediated by a noncholinergic projection. Similar injections of folic acid or kainic acid into the rostral pontine tegmentum, another area with cholinergic cells, cause destruction of both dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The effect on the GABAergic but not that on the dopaminergic cells is blocked by scopolamine. The results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms of epilepsy and of selective neuronal losses in diseases such as Parkinson's disease.", 
    "34": "We have shown that the C57BL/6J ob/ob (obese) mouse, a commonly used model of type II diabetes mellitus, is not in fact consistently hyperglycemic except when exposed to environmental stress. In an attempt to modify stress hyperglycemia in this animal, we administered either a 5 mg/kg dose of the benzodiazepine alprazolam or vehicle (propylene glycol) intraperitoneally to both obese mice and their lean littermates prior to a rest and a stress period. Alprazolam modified the hyperglycemic effect of stress only in the obese mice. Alprazolam significantly reduced plasma corticosterone in obese animals at rest and following stress. In addition, alprazolam significantly increased plasma insulin in all animals at rest and following stress. These data suggest a possible role for benzodiazepines in the modification of stress hyperglycemia in type II diabetes mellitus.", 
    "35": "The non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic buspirone was studied alone and in combination with either haloperidol or apomorphine. Drug effects were evaluated under a baseline of punished and unpunished keypeck responses of pigeons; every 30th response produced food (no punishment) in the presence of a white keylight and, when the keylight was red in alternate 3 min periods, every 30th response produced both food and a brief electric shock (punishment). Buspirone (0.03-3 mg/kg, IM) increased the low rates of punished responding to a maximum of 1000% of control at doses of 0.1-1 mg/kg. Unpunished responding was only marginally affected at lower doses and dose-dependent decreases were obtained from 1 to 10 mg/kg. Although less potent, chlordiazepoxide (1-100 mg/kg IM) produced effects which were similar to those of buspirone, a finding which contrasts with the greater efficacy of benzodiazepines for increasing punished behavior in mammals. Dose-effect functions for buspirone were unchanged by haloperidol administration (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg, IM, 5 min prior) or by concurrent treatment with a behaviorally-ineffective dose of apomorphine (0.003 mg/kg, IM). Rate-decreasing doses of apomorphine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) reversed the increases in punished responding produced by lower doses of buspirone (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) and the apomorphine-induced decreases in unpunished responding were antagonized by buspirone at doses which had little affect when given alone. The ability of buspirone to reverse the rate-decreasing effects of apomorphine on unpunished responding suggests that buspirone does exhibit dopaminergic antagonist properties in vivo. However, effects of buspirone on punished responding of pigeons do not appear to be due to dopaminergic mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "The literature describing the role of serotonin (5-HT) in the mediation of anxiety is a controversial one. Serotonergic involvement in the mechanism of action of two nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics, buspirone and gepirone, supports a role for serotonin in anxiety. The anticonflict effect of both drugs is blocked by serotonin lesions, and gepirone induces the serotonin syndrome. A shift in the gepirone dose-response curve to the left in serotonin lesioned rats suggests that this may be 5-HT-receptor mediated. Both buspirone and gepirone enhance the acoustic startle response and gepirone's effect is attenuated in serotonin lesioned animals. While other components of buspirone's mechanism of action may suppress the behavioral expression of its serotonergic interactions, results from these studies suggest that serotonin agonist-like activity may be an important mechanism in the actions of a clinically proven nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic (buspirone), and anxiolytic candidate (gepirone).", 
    "37": "The current studies further investigated the effects, in animal models of anxiety, of novel putative anxiolytic and anxiogenic compounds believed to induce their effects by actions at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. It was expected that the results would also provide further validation for a novel test of anxiety based on the ratio of open to closed arm entries in an elevated plus maze in the rat. The novel putative anxiolytics CL 218,872 (10-20 mg/kg) and tracazolate (5 mg/kg) significantly elevated the percentage of time spent on the open arms of an elevated plus-maze, consistent with their anxiolytic activity in several other animal tests. Also consistent with results from other animal tests, no anxiolytic activity was observed for the phenylquinoline PK 8165 (10-25 mg/kg), the 3,4-benzodiazepine tofisopam (25-50 mg/kg), or buspirone (0.5-20 mg/kg). The benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists FG 7142 (1-5 mg/kg) and CGS 8216 (3-10 mg/kg) had anxiogenic activity in this test, as did the atypical benzodiazepine Ro 5-4864 (1-5 mg/kg). Interestingly, however, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists Ro 15-1788 (10-20 mg/kg) and ZK 93426 (5-10 mg/kg) had no anxiogenic activity in this test.",

    "39": "In this study the authors report a new method to determine estazolam in blood and urine by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). This compound is a triazolobenzodiazepine and shows an interesting psychopharmacological activity. The extraction from biological fluids was carried out using a mixture of ethylenechloride, methylenechloride, and ethylacetate (1:1:8). The HPLC analysis was carried out with a C18 column, using methanol:phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 0.011M):acetonitrile (65:33:2) as mobile phase. The detector was set at lambda = 240 nm. The method shows good repeatability and a linear response in the range of 0.6 to 10 micrograms estazolam/mL both in serum and urine. A case of non-lethal acute intoxication in which the method was applied is also reported.", 
    "40": "Combined liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with a moving belt interface can be used as a rapid method for the determination of bromazepam, clopenthixol, and reserpine in serum samples obtained from cases of acute overdoses with combinations of these drugs. Low resolution detection limits are about 100 pg for the three drugs, while in high resolution mode the detection limit for bromazepam is shown to be at least 35 pg. Accurate masses were obtained in a serum sample within 5 ppm using high voltage scanning over a narrow mass range for about 10 ng of bromazepam and clopenthixol, respectively. Chemical deactivation of the belt was shown to effectively reduce memory effects and to improve the desorption characteristics of the belt leading to higher yields of evaporated intact molecules.",

NMF and AzN behaved as the agonists of GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Like in diazepam, the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines and nicotinamide was prevented by bicuculline and Ro 15-1788. The given compounds were shown to be more active, than nicotinamide.",

Drug concentration in the above mentioned organs was maximal 0.5-1 hour later. The decrease of the drug and its metabolite level in the organs under study is a biexponential process, consisting of \"quick\" (1-6 hours) and \"slow\" phases. The rate of absorption of hydrated phenazepam analog into the organs and tissues and its elimination is lower than that of phenanzepam.",

    "45": "Two benzodiazepine hypnotics, one with an intermediate elimination t1/2 (temazepam, 15 mg) and the other with a long t1/2 (quazepam, 15 mg), were evaluated in 22- night sleep laboratory studies. The effectiveness and side effects of these benzodiazepines were assessed during short- and intermediate term use. Subjects were also assessed for the presence of rebound insomnia after abrupt withdrawal. Quazepam, 15 mg, was significantly effective in improving sleep both with short- and intermediate-term use, but the effectiveness of temazepam was considerably less. Although temazepam was effective for maintaining sleep with short-term use, there was rapid development of tolerance for this effect with intermediate-term use. Temazepam did not produce any behavioral side effects during either drug condition. The only side effect associated with quazepam was a significant degree of daytime sleepiness. After its withdrawal, temazepam was associated with some sleep and mood disturbance on the first withdrawal night, whereas quazepam had carryover effectiveness.", 
    "46": "The interaction of avermectin B1a (AVM) with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor of rat brain was studied using radioactive ligand binding and tracer ion flux assays. Avermectin potentiated the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and inhibited the binding of both [3H]muscimol and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the GABAA receptor. Inhibition of muscimol binding by AVM suggested competitive displacement. Two kinds of 36chloride (Cl) flux were studied. The 36Cl efflux from preloaded microsacs was potentiated by AVM and was highly inhibited by the Cl-channel blocker 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS). However, it was not potentiated by GABA nor was it sensitive to the convulsants picrotoxin or bicuculline. On the other hand, 36Cl-influx measurement in a different microsac preparation of rat brain was very sensitive to GABA and other GABA-ergic drugs. Avermectin induced 36Cl influx into these microsacs in a dose-dependent manner, but to only 35% of the maximal influx induced by GABA. The AVM-induced 36Cl influx was totally blocked by bicuculline. It is suggested that AVM opens the GABAA-receptor Cl channel by binding to the GABA recognition site and acting as a partial receptor agonist, and also opens a voltage-dependent Cl channel which is totally insensitive to GABA but is very sensitive to DIDS.", 
    "47": "Experiments carried out in the absence or presence of GABA using a synaptosomal fraction from which endogenous GABA was as far as possibly eliminated, seem to indicate that both GABA receptors are involved in the chloride channel opening. This hypothesis is supported by results obtained in the presence of GABA agonist (muscimol) or drugs which are related to the complex GABA receptor-ionophore (diazepam and phenobarbital).", 
    "48": "The anatomical distribution and pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepine receptors in the human spinal cord were examined in four cases aged 20-41 years using in vitro autoradiography and biochemical assays of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. In all cases, the autoradiograms demonstrated that benzodiazepine receptors were distributed in a consistently similar fashion in the gray matter of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions of the human spinal cord. At all levels, the highest densities of benzodiazepine receptors were found to be localized within lamina II of the dorsal horn as defined on cytoarchitectonic, myeloarchitectonic and substance P immunocytochemical criteria. Within this lamina the receptors were concentrated mainly in its deeper, inner portion which lies immediately adjacent to lamina III, with some overlap dorsally into the outer segment of lamina II and ventrally into the adjacent region of lamina III. The lowest density of receptors was found in regions of laminae I, IV, VII and X; in particular, in lamina VII the lowest concentration of receptors was found in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke and the sacral parasympathetic nucleus. The remaining laminae of the spinal gray (laminae, V, VI, VIII and IX) showed a moderate density of receptors. Biochemical assays of membranes prepared from the lumbosacral cord indicated that these [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites have high affinity and have the pharmacological characteristics of the \"central\" Type II benzodiazepine receptor. These results show a high concentration of Type II benzodiazepine receptors in the substantia gelatinosa of the human spinal cord and suggest a possible role for these receptors in spinal sensory functions.", 
    "49": "Polyclonal antibodies have been raised against the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor purified to homogeneity from bovine cerebral cortex in deoxycholate and Triton X-100 media. Radioimmunoassay was applied to measure specific antibody production using the 125I-labelled gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor as antigen. The antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated the binding sites for [3H]muscimol and for [3H]flunitrazepam from purified preparations. In addition, when a 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio] 1-propanesulphonate (CHAPS) extract of bovine brain membranes was treated with the antibodies, those sites as well as the [3H]propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding, the [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding (TBPS), the barbiturate-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding, and the GABA-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding were all removed together into the immunoprecipitate. Western blot experiments showed that these antibodies recognise the alpha-subunit of the purified GABA/benzodiazepine receptor. These results further support the existence in the brain of a single protein, the GABAA receptor, containing a set of regulatory binding sites for benzodiazepines and chloride channel modulators.", 
    "50": "The relative order of activity of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and various analogs in contracting the isolated guinea pig antrum and duodenum correlated with their potencies in activating thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release. The action of TRH in both tissues was selectively antagonized by the putative pituitary TRH receptor antagonist, chlordiazepoxide (10 microM). The data indicate that the contractions produced by TRH in these gut tissues are mediated by TRH receptors with similar characteristics as the pituitary TRH receptors responsible for TSH release.", 
    "51": "The effect of prenatal exposure to diazepam (over gestational days 13-20) on the release of tritiated norepinephrine [( 3H]NE) from selected brain regions was analyzed to determine mechanisms whereby such exposure could disrupt functioning in specific NE neurons, as previously observed. Pregnant rats were administered diazepam (DZ) once daily at doses of 1.0, 2.5 or 10.0 mg/kg and the offspring studied as adults at 70-90 days of age and during development at 14, 21, 35 and 56 days of age. Release of [3H]NE was measured during in vitro incubation using 25 mM potassium as the depolarizing stimulus. As noted previously, prenatal exposure to DZ induced an effect only on NE neurons innervating the hypothalamus, sparing the NE innervation to the hippocampus and cerebellum. Prenatal exposure to DZ had no effect on the depolarized release of [3H]NE in the hypothalamus until after 35 days of age, a developmental pattern previously observed with respect to endogenous NE levels. In adult rat offspring, however, the depolarization-induced release of [3H]NE from the hypothalamus decreased 28%, 32% and 64% (relative to uninjected control values) in animals prenatally exposed to DZ at 1.0, 2.5 or 10 mg/kg/day respectively. Concurrent exposure of the pregnant dam to benzodiazepine antagonists (Ro 15-1788 or ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) prevented the effects of DZ (2.5 mg/kg/day) on [3H]NE release, demonstrating again the importance of the benzodiazepine binding site to the effects induced by the early DZ exposure. The initial accumulation of the [3H]NE was not altered by the prenatal exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The increases in firing rates of hippocampal cells were examined following microiontophoretic application of several muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonists. The agonists studied had been pharmacologically characterized previously and divided into two classes: class A agonists (e.g. acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, and oxotremorine-M) which maximally stimulate PI turnover and reveal mAChR heterogeneity, and class B agonists (e.g. bethanecol and oxotremorine-1) which poorly stimulate PI turnover and do not alter mAChR conformation/orientation in the hippocampus. While comparable stimulatory effects on hippocampal pyramidal cell firing rates were seen with both classes of agonists during short (20 s) ejection periods, longer applications (greater than 25 s) produced class-dependent differential firing patterns. Prolonged ejection of class A agonists selectively desensitized cells to further, continued application in the same ejection period, and the firing rates declined. Class B agonists produced stimulatory responses in hippocampal cells during the entire ejection period, and DE was not observed. This desensitization effect (DE) was observed only for bursts and not for simple spikes.", 
    "53": "Continuous release of diazepam from subcutaneously implanted silastic capsules provided significant protection against pentylenetetrazol seizures in rats for up to 3 weeks. However, the degree of protection seen after 3 weeks of exposure to diazepam was significantly less than after 1 h. These data suggest that continuous exposure to constant low levels of diazepam results in the development of partial tolerance which is not sufficient to eliminate significant anticonvulsant effects.", 
    "54": "The acute administration of 1R,cis, alpha S-cypermethrin, deltamethrin fenvalerate and permethrin produced a dose-dependent lowering of the dose of pentylenetetrazol required to elicit a seizure in rats. The proconvulsant action of cypermethrin displayed stereospecificity in that the 1R, cis, alpha S isomer of cypermethrin was the most potent compound tested, while the non-insecticidal isomer, 1S,cis, alpha R-cypermethrin, was devoid of proconvulsant activity. Pretreatment of rats with PK 11195, an antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, elicited a complete reversal of the proconvulsant actions of both deltamethrin and permethrin. In contrast, pretreatment with phenytoin did not alter the pyrethroid-induced proconvulsant activity. These results suggest that the effects of pyrethroids on pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold are mediated via an interaction with peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "55": "A decrease of 30% was observed in the density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in platelets of nine schizophrenics maintained on chronic neuroleptic treatment as compared to platelets of six untreated schizophrenics and 15 healthy volunteers. The equilibrium dissociation constant for binding by [3H]PK 11195, which is a ligand specific for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, was similar in all three groups. The relevance of the reduction in peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites to central or peripheral side-effects induced by long-term neuroleptic treatment merits further investigation.", 
    "56": "Oral contraceptives (OCs) should be used with additional caution in combination with other drugs in certain disease states. This discussion focuses on only those interactions which are due to identifiable pharmacokinetic processes. Pharmacological interactions between OCs and other compounds may be of 2 kinds: drugs may impair the effectiveness of the OCs to cause breakthrough bleeding or to allow pregnancy to occur; and OCs may interfere with the metabolism of other componds. In general, interactions of the 1st kind are due to interference with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of estrogens, and interactions of the 2nd kind are due to competition for metabolic pathways. It is difficult to obtain estimates of the frequency of interactions, but it seems likely that, as low-dose preparations become more widely used, interactions of the 1st type will become more common and those of the 2nd type less common. Although it is probably only those women with low plasma hormone concentrations who are at risk that other drugs may interfere with contraceptive efficacy, and women with high plasma concentrations of estrogen who are at risk of side-effects and that OCs may interfere with other drugs, there is no way of detecting women in either category. Consequently, it is safer for the present to assuume that all women who take OCs might be at risk of some form of interaction. Significant drug interactions in which contraceptive efficacy is reduced are more likely to occur in the early part of the cycle when circulating hormone concentrations are of critical importance. It is well known that infective diarrhea can induce OC failure by increasing gastrointestinal motility and reducing hormone absorption. Thus, any drug which reduces gut transit time and causes diarrhea is potentially likely to reduce circulating concentrations of OCs. The sulphation of ethinl-estradiol in the gastrointestinal wall has been shown to be a site of interaction for the enhancement of the activity of OCs. Ascorbic acid also undergoes sulphate conjugation in the gut wall and acts as a competitive inhibitor for sulphation of estrogens. The most clinically significant group of interactions occurs with other drugs that are metabolized by the same hepatic microsomal pathways as is estrogen. Most of the anticonvulsant drugs are inducers of microsomal enzymes. Rifampicin is known to be a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal enzymes and has been shown to increase the rate of metabolism of both estrogeens and progestogens. A recent report has suggested that the antifugal drug griseofulvin may cause a clinically important interaction with OCs. There are numerous well documented clinical reports of women who have taken OCs without missing a dose who have become pregnant while taking a variety of antibiotic agents such as ampicllin and tetracycline. Estrogens are inhibitors of hepatic microsomal enzymes. In this way they may show the metabolsim of other drugs, thus increasing their plasma and tissue concentrations and increasing the risk of side-effects. These interactions might be expected to become less common as the concentration of estrogen in OCS decreases.", 
    "57": "Medical auditing has moved beyond the traditional chart review to the process audit, which identifies deficiencies in care and suggests remedies. In 1981 the audit committee of the Department of Psychiatry at Toronto General Hospital audited the use of hypnotic drugs in the inpatient unit. The audit produced two recommendations: that nursing staff record sleep graphs for inpatients more often, and that an educational program be instituted to change the physicians' patterns of prescribing hypnotics. In 1983 the audit was repeated to test the effectiveness of the 1981 auditing process. The 1981 recommendation produced the desired improvement in recording of sleep graphs. However, the medical staff failed to change their patterns of prescribing hypnotics: oxazepam remained the preferred hypnotic. For the process audit to be effective in improving patient care those using it must ensure that the methods reflect the nature and structure of the professional group they are trying to influence.", 
    "58": "To date, attempts to map the distribution and density of benzodiazepine receptors in the CNS have been dominated by radiohistochemical techniques with conventional receptor binding. Their limited resolution, however, prompted us to try an immunohistochemical approach. Purified GABA/benzodiazepine receptors, prepared from bovine cerebral cortex, have been used to raise monoclonal antibodies for this purpose. Immunoreactive sites in rat brain, spinal cord and retina as well as in bovine and post-mortem human brain were found to be concentrated on neuronal cell bodies and processes in those regions known to be innervated by GABAergic neurons. Electron microscopic analysis revealed a selective staining of axosomatic and axodendritic pre- and postsynaptic contacts.",

This photo-affinity labeling (PAL) drastically reduces the potency of FZ binding to these membranes, but the binding of 3H-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester (3H-BCCE) was found to be essentially unchanged. 3H-BCCE binding was therefore determined in the presence of an antagonist (BCCE itself), an agonist (FZ) and a compound reported to discriminate between multiple benzodiazepine sites (CL 218,872). The results with BCCE are consistent with a single population of sites, but FZ binds to some of the sites with a reduced affinity (KI = 30 nM) and to the remaining sites with a very low affinity (KI approximately equal to 1 microM). CL 218,872 shows a reduced affinity but appears to interact with all of the sites. Taken together, these results indicate that the binding domains for BCCE and FZ are not identical, and that CL 218,872 interacts more strongly with the antagonist domain.", 
    "60": "Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg, ip) and CGS 8216 (10 mg/kg, ip) significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of diazepam (5 mg/kg, ip) on electrically induced head-turning in rats. Neither antagonist alone, at the dose level which blocked diazepam, had any intrinsic activity in this model. The specificity of the interaction between CGS 8216 and diazepam was further confirmed by the lack of antagonism by CGS 8216 of muscimol's inhibitory effect on head-turning. These results provide additional evidence that the inhibition of head-turning induced by diazepam is mediated via the benzodiazepine binding site. Furthermore, this model provides a functional expression of the interaction between the benzodiazepine recognition site, the chloride ionophore, and the GABA receptor complex.", 
    "61": "The brain benzodiazepine system has been implicated to be important in both the mechanism, and treatment of ethanol related syndromes. In this report evidence is presented which indicates that \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites are probably more relevant than \"central type\" receptors for the neurochemical consequences of ethanol dependence and withdrawal states. Utilizing radioreceptor binding techniques 20-50% increases in the binding of [3H]RO-5-4864 (a \"peripheral type\" ligand) to brain membranes derived from rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus are observed in ethanol dependent rats. These increases persist for 3 days after cessation of ethanol. The number of [3H]RO-5-4864 binding sites in cerebellum returns to normal during 4-7 days after ethanol withdrawal. In all brain areas examined no changes were observed in the \"central type\" benzodiazepine receptor as judged by [3H]-ethyl-Beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, BCCE binding. Scatchard analysis revealed that the number of [3H]RO-5-4864 binding sites is increased in each brain area while the affinity was unchanged.", 
    "62": "In a randomised study, 6 different premedications (oral flunitrazepam, oral pentobarbital, oral physiological NaCl solution, intramuscular pethidine, intramuscular droperidol/fentanyl, intramuscular physiological NaCl solution) were administered to 600 patients to determine the equal efficacy of the premedicative drugs in oral or parenteral administration. Patients gave the best rating to the oral application of flunitrazepam. The differences in the assessment of application and effect of the drugs are contrasted by the statement that most patients do not feel any direct influence on their preoperative anxiety by premedication. However, it is easier for them to cope with anxiety because premedication pacifies the patients, whereas each of the dependent variables, such as apprehension, is influenced differently. Oral premedication again proves superior to parenteral premedication.", 
    "63": "In a randomised study, 6 different premedications (oral flunitrazepam, oral pentobarbital, oral NaCl solution; intramuscular pethidine, intramuscular droperidol/fentanyl, and intramuscular NaCl solution) were administered to 600 patients, to determine the equal efficacy of oral and intramuscular application. The results show a significantly better mode of action of oral premedication.", 
    "64": "Diazepam was administered to 100 parturients in labour with a view to accelerating the dilatation of the cervix. The result was found to be encouraging. The indications for it are: prolonged or stationary dilatation, oedema of the cervix, poorly stimulated cervices, cervix retracted after giving birth to first of twins, block of the last head in breech deliveries resulting from a cervical spasm, prolapse of the umbilical cord requiring instantaneous complete dilation, foetal distress, etc. Diazepam weakens neither uterine contractions nor maternal efforts of expulsion. There is no harmful effect to mother and child. In the study there were 58 primiparas and 42 multiparas.", 
    "65": "The persistence of untreated depression was evaluated in 49 severely depressed alcoholics. After 2 weeks of sobriety, 80% of patients with initial major depression by Research Diagnostic Criteria were no longer depressed. These patients improved without antidepressant medications, suggesting the need for a 2-week period of sobriety before psychopharmacotherapy for depression is instituted. Many severe depressions in actively drinking or recently sober alcoholics may represent alcohol-induced organic affective syndromes which, unlike major depressive illness, remit spontaneously with sobriety.", 
    "66": "In a follow-up study (mean, approximately six months), nitrazepam was helpful in suppressing periodic movements in sleep (sleep-related myoclonus) and improving disturbed sleep physiology and daytime symptoms of 13 patients (mean age - 53 yr).", 
    "67": "Effects of an imidazo-pyridine (zolpidem: 10, 20 and 30 mg) on overnight sleep and on performance the next day were studied in young adults and in middle aged individuals. The young adults were used particularly as an homogenous group to establish any possible adverse effects of the drug on sleep and on performance the next day, and the middle aged subjects with their less restful sleep were used to study efficacy. In the young adults zolpidem led to a marked increase in slow wave sleep with a reduction in stage 2 sleep. There were no significant changes in REM sleep, though there was a tendency for REM sleep to be delayed. In the middle aged there was a reduction in awake activity and drowsy sleep with an increase in stage 2 sleep. The latency to REM sleep was increased but the duration of REM sleep over the whole night was not reduced. Digit symbol substitution and a complex reaction time task were used to study performance, but there were no residual effects with zolpidem (9 h after ingestion). Zolpidem is likely to prove useful in the management of transient and short-term insomnia in healthy middle aged individuals when impaired performance the next day is to be avoided.", 
    "68": "Clonazepam was administered rectally to six children aged 1.4 to 4.7 years in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg and to five children aged 1.4 to 4.1 years in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations indicate that it is rapidly absorbed, and it may therefore be an alternative to rectal administration of diazepam in continuing convulsions.", 
    "69": "When placed in a water-filled arena in which one area is illuminated mice tend to remain in the illuminated region. Moreover, in a forced-swim task mice initially exhibit vigorous responding followed by a rapid decay of active swimming, and the adoption of a characteristic floating posture. Immediately following exposure to inescapable shock the response invigoration was appreciably enhanced, as was the tendency to remain in the illuminated region of the arena. Administration of low doses of diazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) prior to testing effectively eliminated the response invigoration, as well as the response of approaching the illuminated region of the arena. It is proposed that the behavioral variations evident soon after uncontrollable shock are related to a transient increase of anxiety or vigilance. Moreover, it is suggested that several time-dependent behavioral variations associated with inescapable shock may be related to alterations of anxiety.", 
    "70": "The effects of diazepam on morphine analgesia dose effect curves in the formalin test and in two forms of the tail flick test were examined. In one form of the tail flick test the animals were restrained in wire restrainers (a stressful procedure) while in the other they were left free and briefly handheld for testing. Morphine analgesia in the restrained form of the test is known to depend on raphe magnus 5HT projections to the spinal cord while the other tests do not involve this system. Diazepam (0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg) noncompetitively antagonized morphine analgesia in the formalin test but had no effect on morphine analgesia in the tail flick test. It is concluded that diazepam does not antagonize morphine analgesia through its antianxiety action reducing the serotonergic response to stress. It is suggested that the sensitivity of the formalin test to diazepam antagonism of morphine analgesia may be of clinical significance since formalin test pain resembles postoperative pain in humans.", 
    "71": "Benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide (CDP) promote feeding in a number of species. This effect has been interpreted generally to be an indirect consequence of benzodiazepine anti-anxiety action, although some have questioned whether it might not reflect instead a direct action upon the reinforcing properties of foods. The present study employed a behavioral measure that can discriminate between these possibilities: palatability-dependent consummatory actions elicited in rats by tastes. The results suggest that chlordiazepoxide enhances the positive palatability of tastes selectively while having little or no effect on aversive palatability. The net effect is to make tastes more reinforcing following CDP administration.", 
    "72": "The effects of Ro 5-4864 (chlordiazepam) were examined on responding for self-stimulation of the mid-lateral hypothalamus. Rewarding stimuli were delivered according to a 10-sec variable interval schedule of reinforcement. Ro 5-4864 (10-30 mg/kg, subconsulsive doses in these rats) decreased responding. This effect was antagonized by chlordiazepoxide (5-10 mg/kg) and phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg) but not by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10-20 mg/kg), the ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors PK 11195 (60 mg/kg) or phenytoin (60 mg/kg). The pattern of interactions of Ro 5-4864 with these compounds differs from the pattern obtained with other procedures, and suggests that Ro 5-4864 has effects on systems unrelated to anxiety, convulsive activity or sedation.", 
    "73": "A 1-year follow-up was conducted on patients who had participated in a 6-month diazepam maintenance study. Of 180 patients contacted, 131 patients (73%) responded. Observed relapse rate was 63%, and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) scores at follow-up were significantly higher for relapsed than for nonrelapsed patients. Two thirds of all relapsed patients sought some kind of medical, social, or psychiatric help, frequently including medication. Patients who were the most improved at the end of the diazepam maintenance trial consistently had the lowest HSCL scores at the time of follow-up. The implication of these findings for the management of chronic anxious patients is discussed.", 
    "74": "The effect of time of day of drug administration on triazolam pharmacokinetics was studied in ten healthy men. In a randomized, two-way, crossover investigation, each subject received one 0.5 mg triazolam tablet either in the morning (7 AM) or evening (10 PM). Blood samples were obtained immediately before dosing and at selected times up to 12 hours after dosing. Triazolam plasma concentrations were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Psychomotor performance tests, including digit symbol substitution, card sorting by suits, and card sorting by fours, were administered, and the subjects' sedation was rated before drug and at two, ten, and 12 hours after drug administration. In addition, anterograde amnesia was assessed by showing objects to subjects two hours after dosing and testing aided and unaided recall at ten hours following administration. Triazolam's apparent elimination half-life after evening administration was significantly longer than after daytime ingestion (3.77 hr vs. 2.94 hr, P less than .05). There was no difference between times of dosing in total oral clearance or apparent volume of distribution. The absorption of triazolam was slower after evening administration, with an absorption half-life of 21.9 vs 13.3 minutes after daytime dosing. Performance decrements were significantly greater two hours after dosing in evening than in the daytime, but anterograde amnesia was more pronounced after daytime dosing. There was no effect on psychomotor performance at ten or 12 hours after administration in daytime or evening. These results indicate temporal variation in triazolam absorption and elimination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Parameters of 14C-7-bromo-5-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2 and its main metabolite distribution in the blood plasma and brain of mice were compared with phenazepam and nordiazepam distribution. Constant ratio of blood plasma 14C-7-bromo-5-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-3A-1,4-benzodiazepine-2, its 3-hydroxy metabolite and other derivatives' level to brain level was noted vs their changing content in the mentioned test objects. Characteristic peculiarities of the distribution of initial 1,4-benzodiazepines and their metabolites and its predictive value are discussed.", 
    "76": "Fourteen patients with normal, global, left ventricular function scheduled for elective myocardial revascularization were studied at rest and during atrial pacing before and during isoflurane anesthesia (0.5% end-tidal) plus 50% nitrous oxide. Rapid atrial pacing was performed in a stepwise fashion until the onset of angina pectoris in the awake patients. The same step increase in pacing rate was applied in the anesthetized patients. Compared with prepacing baseline values, isoflurane significantly decreased systemic blood pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, the rate-pressure product, and cardiac index. No patient had ST-segment depression while awake or during isoflurane anesthesia before pacing was started. Prepacing left and right ventricular filling pressures and wave forms were normal, both while awake and during isoflurane anesthesia. The mean pacing rate at which first signs of myocardial ischemia appeared (V5 ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV, increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) to greater than or equal to 15 mmHg, and prominent PCWP v-waves greater than or equal to 20 mmHg) was significantly higher during isoflurane anesthesia than in the awake patients (128 +/- 4 vs. 115 +/- 5 beats/min). With the exception of one patient, the individual pacing rates inducing first signs of ischemia in the awake patients were below the anginal threshold. None of the patients had a reduced ischemic threshold during anesthesia. Eleven anesthetized patients tolerated a higher pacing rate until initial signs of ischemia appeared. In four of these patients, the pacing rate required to induce first signs of ischemia was above the heart rate at which chest pain had been induced while they were awake. At a peak atrial pacing rate of 129 +/- 5 beats/min, which had induced angina pectoris in the awake patients, the increase in PCWP was significantly smaller during pacing with isoflurane than during control pacing. Prominent PCWP v-waves (greater than or equal to 20 mmHg) appeared in 12 of the 14 patients during initial pacing to angina and in eight patients paced during isoflurane anesthesia. In six of these eight patients, the abnormal v-waves were less prominent than those observed during control pacing. Ischemic ST-segment changes developed in 13 of 14 patients during initial pacing and in nine patients during pacing with isoflurane. Mean V5 ST-segment depression during the two pacing periods was significantly different, averaging 0.19 and 0.11 mV, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "77": "A survey of 133 senior medical students revealed that noteworthy proportions had used the following psychoactive substances during their lifetime: cigarettes, 44%; alcohol, 96%; marijuana, 57%; amphetamines, 22%; cocaine, 20%; sedatives, 17%; benzodiazepines, 37%; hallucinogens, 15%; and opioids, 40%. Smaller percentages reported use of these substances during the last year and the last month. Lifetime use did not vary significantly by sex, ethnic status, or marital status. Twelve percent reported nearly daily use of one or more substances during the last month; a different but overlapping 11% reported substance abuse symptoms during the last year. Use of illicit substances and substance abuse symptoms were associated with depressed mood.", 
    "78": "In a 2-year retrospective review, 90 patients were treated in a children's hospital for acute overdoses. In 90%, the history was the most important indicator of poisoning. On physical examination, 64% of patients were found to have altered sensorium, and 69% of cases were confirmed with a routine qualitative toxicology screening test. Accidental overdoses were most frequently due to ingestion of petroleum distillates, digoxin, carbamazepine, and theophylline. Suicidal patients ingested alcohol, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and aspirin. The majority of children with accidental overdoses received medical attention within 2 hours, but suicidal patients presented significantly later. Appropriate treatment with gastric lavage or emesis was used for 85% of patients on an emergency basis prior to admission. The inpatient therapy is based on continued gastrointestinal decontamination, basic organ system support, and monitoring for toxic effects and complications of therapy. Specific antidotes were available for only 10% of patients. In this study, 50% of patients were able to be discharged to their homes after one day of hospitalization. Pediatric patients treated in the intensive care unit incur less morbidity than adults in a similar setting. Adolescents who attempt suicide and are treated in the intensive care unit are likely to take prescription drugs in a similar manner as their adult counterparts.", 
    "79": "Imipramine, phenelzine, and alprazolam have each been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of panic disorder and in agoraphobia with panic attacks. Clonazepam is a high-potency 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative with an intermediate to long elimination half-life that is used mainly in neurology as an antiepileptic. Eight cases of recurrent panic attacks successfully treated with clonazepam are reported."
