Moreover, therapeutic possibilities of memantine, gabapentine, pregabalin, baclofen, modafinil, ondansetron D-cycloserine and aripiprazole are studying nowadays. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including fluvoxamine for alcohol patients is of great importance due to frequent comorbidity of alcoholism, depression and anxiety.

The most distinct changes were found in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus caudatus and cerebella cortex. Alcohol abuse induced greater changes in mitochondrial membranes compared to synaptosomal membranes that was consistent with physiological and defensive functions of mitochondrial membranes and CNS under the influence of toxic substances. The affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro5-4864 binding with membranes was decreased, but the capacity of receptors was increased in the brain cortex of alcohol-preferring male rats compared to alcohol non-preferring rats. Administration of anticonvulsant meta-chloro-benzhydryl-urea to rats prefer ethanol increased the affinity of BDR.", 
    "4": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating anxiety disorder that may develop after an individual has experienced or witnessed a severe traumatic event. It has been shown that the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) may be correlated with PTSD and that the TSPO ligand improved the behavioral deficits in a mouse model of PTSD. Midazolam, a ligand for TSPO and central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR), induces anxiolytic- and anti-depressant-like effects in animal models. The present study aimed to determine whether midazolam ameliorates PTSD behavior in rats as assessed by the single prolonged stress (SPS) model. The SPS rats received daily Sertraline (Ser) (15 mg/kg, i.p.) [corrected] and midazolam (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) [corrected] during the exposure to SPS and behavioral assessments, which included the open field (OF) test, the contextual fear paradigm (CFP), and the elevated plus-maze (EPM). The results showed that, like Ser (15 mg/kg, i.p.) [corrected], midazolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) [corrected] significantly reversed the behavioral deficiencies of the SPS rats, including PTSD-associated freezing and anxiety-like behavior but not the effects on spontaneous locomotor activity. In addition, the anti-PTSD effects of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) [corrected] were antagonized by the TSPO antagonist PK11195 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), the CBR antagonist flumazenil (15 mg/kg, i.p.) [corrected] and the inhibitor of steroidogenic enzymes finasteride (30 mg/kg, i.p.) [corrected], which by themselves had no effect on PTSD-associated freezing and anxiety-like behavior. In summary, this study demonstrated that midazolam improves the behavioral deficits in the SPS model through dual TSPO and CBR and neurosteroidogenesis.",

The condition is distinguished by burning symptoms of the oral mucosa and the absence of any clinical signs. The etiology of BMS is complex and it includes a variety of factors. Local, systemic and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety and depression are listed among the possible causes of BMS. BMS may sometimes be classified as BMS Type I, II or III. Although this syndrome is not accompanied by evident organic alterations and it does not present health risks, it can significantly reduce the patient's quality of life. This study analyzes the available literature related to BMS, and makes special reference to its therapeutic management. The pages that follow will also discuss the diagnostic criteria that should be respected, etiological factors, and clinical aspects. We used the PubMed database and searched it by using the keywords \"burning mouth syndrome\", \"BMS and review\", and \"burning mouth and review\", in the title or abstract of the publication. BMS treatment usually steers towards the management of the symptoms; however, the specific local factors that could play a significant role in worsening the oral burning sensation should be eradicated. The most widely accepted treatment options that show variable results include tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines and antipsychotic drugs; nevertheless there are other therapies that can also be carried out.

The pharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia is limited to a few drugs that have been demonstrated to be moderately effective in some but not all dimensions of the disease. Therefore, the search for new drugs to treat this condition is warranted. Atypical antipsychotics offered an attractive alternative because they had been shown to be active against several key symptoms of fibromyalgia. The results of open-label studies, however, appear to indicate that atypical antipsychotics are poorly tolerated in patients with fibromyalgia, and only quetiapine XR has been studied in randomized controlled trials. Quetiapine XR has demonstrated effectiveness in treating comorbid major depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance. However, in two randomized controlled trials, quetiapine XR was not differentiated from placebo and failed to demonstrate noninferiority to amitriptyline in terms of improving overall symptomatology. The effect of quetiapine XR on pain and its usefulness as part of a combination pharmacological regimen should be further evaluated. Overall, the use of quetiapine (initiated at a low dose and slowly titrated) in fibromyalgia should be limited to patients with comorbid major depression or patients who are currently receiving other treatments and have unresolved and disabling depressive and/or anxiety symptoms.",

We designed three experiments to assess whether exposure to CZP affects social behavior in respect to the age of rats and the test circumstances, specifically their familiarity with test conditions during adolescence (P32), social behavior in juveniles and adolescents (P18-P42) and social behavior in a resident-intruder paradigm. The frequency and duration of a various patterns of social behavior related to play and social investigation not related to play were evaluated. The results showed that CZP postnatal exposure decreased social play behavior regardless of age and familiarity or unfamiliarity of experimental environment but did not affect the social investigation per se. When rats were confronted with an intruder in their home cages intense wrestling and inhibition of genital investigation were found. In conclusion, these findings show that short-term CZP postnatal exposure inhibits social play behavior and alters specific patterns of social behavior in an age and environment related manner.", 
    "49": "Modulation of Cys loop receptor ion channels is a proven drug discovery strategy, but many underlying mechanisms of the mode of action are poorly understood. We report the x-ray structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein from Lymnaea stagnalis with NS9283, a stoichiometry selective positive modulator that targets the \u03b14-\u03b14 interface of \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Together with homology modeling, mutational data, quantum mechanical calculations, and pharmacological studies on \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs, the structure reveals a modulator binding mode that overlaps the \u03b14-\u03b14 interface agonist (acetylcholine)-binding site. Analysis of contacts to residues known to govern agonist binding and function suggests that modulation occurs by an agonist-like mechanism. Selectivity for \u03b14-\u03b14 over \u03b14-\u03b22 interfaces is determined mainly by steric restrictions from Val-136 on the \u03b22-subunit and favorable interactions between NS9283 and His-142 at the complementary side of \u03b14. In the concentration ranges where modulation is observed, its selectivity prevents NS9283 from directly activating nAChRs because activation requires coordinated action from more than one interface. However, we demonstrate that in a mutant receptor with one natural and two engineered \u03b14-\u03b14 interfaces, NS9283 is an agonist. Modulation via extracellular binding sites is well known for benzodiazepines acting at \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Like NS9283, benzodiazepines increase the apparent agonist potency with a minimal effect on efficacy. The shared modulatory profile along with a binding site located in an extracellular subunit interface suggest that modulation via an agonist-like mechanism may be a common mechanism of action that potentially could apply to Cys loop receptors beyond the \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs.", 
    "50": "Ion channels, like many other proteins, are composed of multiple structural domains. A stimulus that impinges on one domain, such as binding of a ligand to its recognition site, can influence the activity of another domain, such as a transmembrane channel gate, through interdomain interactions. Kinetic schemes that describe the function of interacting domains typically incorporate a minimal number of states and transitions, and do not explicitly model interactions between domains. Here, we develop a kinetic model of the GABAA receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel modulated by numerous compounds including benzodiazepines, a class of drugs used clinically as sedatives and anxiolytics. Our model explicitly treats both the kinetics of distinct functional domains within the receptor and the interactions between these domains. The model describes not only how benzodiazepines that potentiate GABAA receptor activity, such as diazepam, affect peak current dose-response relationships in the presence of desensitization, but also their effect on the detailed kinetics of current activation, desensitization, and deactivation in response to various stimulation protocols. Finally, our model explains positive modulation by benzodiazepines of receptor currents elicited by either full or partial agonists, and can resolve conflicting observations arguing for benzodiazepine modulation of agonist binding versus channel gating.",

Since then, she had undergone mandibular resection and shaving the instrument several times because of recurrence of the tumor and/or fracture of the instrument. This time, some parts of the instrument were removed under general anesthesia since it had exposed from the skin. Difficulty in mask ventilation and intubation was predicted due to the defect of mandible and some muscles supporting the tongue and the pharynx. Awake fiber-optic nasotracheal intubation, therefore, was performed in consideration of airway obstruction. Dexmedetomidine was administered to reduce the risk of bone fracture in addition to low doses of midazolam and fentanyl.

In patients with severe neck subcutaneous emphysema, management of difficult airway is the most important safety issue in the practice of anesthesia. Following the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) guidelines for management of difficult airway, we prepared various types of equipment to facilitate intubation and surgeons were beside the patient during induction of anesthesia for emergency invasive airway access. To prevent the progression of emphysema, preservation of spontaneous breathing during the perioperative period was also important. Combined with propofol and midazolam, pethidine was an effective agent for safe anesthetic induction because it produces less respiratory depression compared to other opiate analgesics. In conclusion, this case demonstrates the importance of prediction of and preparation for difficult airway. Furthermore, anesthesiologists should consider the optimization of anesthesia to avoid progression of emphysema.",

Nanomechanical attributes of oriented single crystals were determined with instrumented nanoindentation, and bulk deformational properties were assessed with the Walker and Heckel models as well as the elastic relaxation index. Good correlations were established between bulk and single-crystal plasticity parameters: the Walker coefficient and indentation hardness. The Walker model showed more practical value for evaluating bulk deformational properties of the APIs investigated because their properties differed more distinctly compared to the Heckel model. In addition, it was possible to predict the elastic properties of the materials investigated at the bulk level because a correlation between the elastic relaxation index and compliance was established. The value of using indentation hardness for crystalline APIs was also confirmed because their compactibility at the bulk level was able to be predicted. Mechanically interlocked structures were characteristic of most polymorphic forms investigated, resulting in single crystals having isotropic mechanical properties.

Midazolam is the preferred drug in intensive care units for sedation and anesthesia. Ketamine/xylazine combination is used as an anesthetic agent in veterinary medicine and experimental animals. Aside from anaesthetic properties, these agents can cause physiologic and metabolic alterations and modulate and improve the inflammatory responses. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of ketamine, midazolam, and veterinary and experimentally used ketamine/xylazine combination in acute lung injury induced by \u03b1-naphthylthiourea (ANTU).",

    "87": "Several effects of the abused synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 were compared to those of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) in rhesus monkeys. JWH-018 (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) was established as a discriminative stimulus and rimonabant was used to examine mechanisms responsible for discrimination as well as operant response rate-decreasing and hypothermic effects. JWH-018 dose-dependently increased drug-lever responding (ED50=0.01 mg/kg) and decreased response rate (ED50=0.064 mg/kg). Among various cannabinoids, the relative potency for producing discriminative stimulus and rate-decreasing effects was the same: CP-55940=JWH-018>\u03949-THC=WIN-55212-2=JWH-073. The benzodiazepine agonist midazolam and the NMDA antagonist ketamine did not exert JWH-018 like discriminative stimulus effects up to doses that disrupted responding. JWH-018 and \u03949-THC decreased rectal temperature by 2.2 and 2.8\u00b0C, respectively; the doses decreasing temperature by 2\u00b0C were 0.21 and 1.14 mg/kg, respectively. Antagonism did not differ between JWH-018 and \u03949-THC, but did differ among effects. The apparent affinities of rimonabant calculated in the presence of JWH-018 and \u03949-THC were not different from each other for antagonism of discriminative stimulus effects (6.58 and 6.59, respectively) or hypothermic effects (7.08 and 7.19, respectively). Apparent affinity estimates are consistent with the same receptors mediating the discriminative stimulus and hypothermic effects of both JWH-018 and \u03949-THC. However, there was more limited and less orderly antagonism of rate-decreasing effects, suggesting that an additional receptor mechanism is involved in mediating the effects of cannabinoids on response rate. Overall, these results strongly suggest that JWH-018 and \u03949-THC act at the same receptors to produce several of their shared psychopharmacological effects.",

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis may underlie antidepressant responses, but diazepam co-administration impairs murine neuron maturation and survival in response to fluoxetine.

MD*ADT*BZD had fewer granule neurons vs. MD*ADT in anterior DG and vs. controls in mid DG, and did not differ from untreated-MD in any DG subregion. MD*ADT had more granule neurons than untreated-MD in anterior and mid DG and comparable granule neuron number to controls in all dentate subregions.

There were no between-group differences in mid DG in mitotic cells or in posterior DG for any cell type. Our results in mid-dentate, and to some degree anterior dentate, gyrus are consistent with murine findings that benzodiazepines counteract antidepressant-induced increases in neurogenesis by interfering with progenitor proliferation.

Despite the higher prevalence of cardiovascular complications in patients with schizophrenia, the effects of antipsychotic drugs on vascular tone and cardiac contractility have received little attention. In order to better understand the cardiovascular effects of antipsychotic drugs, we investigated if the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine alters in vivo cardiovascular function in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared with indwelling catheters. After 4 h of recovery from surgery, the mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP; index of body venous tone), heart rate, left ventricular peak systolic pressure (LVP) and cardiac contractility (\u00b1dP/dt) were measured in conscious, unrestrained rats for 60 min after a single injection of olanzapine (3 or 15 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. Cardiovascular measurements were not altered at any time points in the vehicle-treated rats. Olanzapine did not affect heart rate, but dose-dependently decreased MAP, MCFP, LVP and +dP/dt. Acute olanzapine treatment in rats thus reduced blood pressure and venous tone, as well as cardiac contractile function. Decreased venous tone may be a contributing factor to orthostatic hypotension commonly observed in patients during initiation of antipsychotic therapy.",

The mechanism of clozapine-induced idiosyncratic agranulocytosis is unknown. Although most patients treated with clozapine do not develop agranulocytosis, most do have an immune response with an increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and a release of immature neutrophils with neutrophilia rather than agranulocytosis. We have previously shown that treatment of rabbits with clozapine also causes an early release of neutrophils. Clozapine is oxidized to a reactive nitrenium ion that covalently binds to neutrophils, and this reactive metabolite may be responsible for the observed effects. Olanzapine and clozapine have very similar structures, and olanzapine is also oxidized to a reactive nitrenium ion; however, if it ever causes agranulocytosis, the incidence is much lower than that of clozapine. One possible basis for the difference in incidence of agranulocytosis between clozapine and olanzapine is that the therapeutic dose of olanzapine is much lower than that of clozapine. In this study, we compared the effects of clozapine and olanzapine in Sprague-Dawley rats at an equimolar dose and found that only clozapine had a significant effect on neutrophil kinetics. This suggests that the immune response and effects on neutrophil kinetics induced by clozapine are related to its ability to cause agranulocytosis.", 
    "108": "Epilepsy affects about 40 million people worldwide. Many drugs block seizures, but have little effect in preventing or curing this disease. So the search for new drugs for epilepsy treatment using animal models prior to testing in humans is important. Increasingly pharmaceutical industries invest in the Re\u200bsearch & Drug Development area to seek safe and effective new therapeutic alternatives to the currently available epilepsy treatment. In this perspective, natural compounds have been investigated in epilepsy models, particularly the monoterpenes obtained from medicinal plants. In our study we investigated the effects of cyane-carvone (CC), a synthetic substance prepared from natural a monoterpene, carvone, against pilocarpine- (PILO), pentylenetetrazole- (PTZ) and picrotoxine (PTX)-induced seizures in mice after acute treatment with repeated oral doses (CC 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) for 14 days. CC in all doses tested showed increase in latency to first seizure, decrease in percentages of seizuring animals as well as reduction percentages of dead animals (p<0.05) in PILO, PTZ and PTX groups when compared with vehicle. However, these effects were not reversed by flumazenil, benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist used to investigate the CC action mechanism. Our results suggest that acute treatment with CC at the doses tested can exert anticonvulsant effects in PILO, PTZ and PTX epilepsy models. In addition, our data suggest that CC could act in an allosteric site of GABAA, which would be different from the site in which BDZ acts, since flumazenil was not able to reverse any of CC effects on the modulation of seizure parameters related with epilepsy models investigated. New studies should be conducted to investigate CC effects in other neurotransmitter systems. Nevertheless, our study reinforces the hypothesis that CC could be used, after further research, as a new pharmaceutical formulation and a promising alternative for epilepsy treatment, since it showed anticonvulsant effects.",

The ability of a compound to occupy significant levels of D3 receptors is important for achieving therapeutic efficacy in both pre-clinical and clinical settings. Here we attempt to characterise antipsychotic drug-effects at D3 receptors by measuring receptor occupancy via ex-vivo [3H]7-OH-DPAT autoradiography, and further validating this outcome via analysis of Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) in the rat major islands of Calleja (ICjM), a brain structure with high D3 expression. Rats were treated subcutaneously with haloperidol (0.04 mg/kg), clozapine (20 mg/kg) and olanzapine (0.63 mg/kg), the selective D2 antagonist L-741626 (2.5 mg/kg) and the selective D3 antagonist SB-277011-A (10 mg/kg). Doses were based on levels of D2 occupancy considered clinically relevant (60-80%). When measuring D3 occupancy, clozapine and SB-277011-A displayed meaningful levels of occupancy (60% and 77%, respectively), haloperidol and olanzapine showed limited occupancy (16% and 27%, respectively), whereas L-741626 showed no occupancy. There were no significant changes in ICjM Fos-LI after L-741626 and haloperidol treatment, minor but significant increases after olanzapine treatment, whereas highly significant increases were seen with SB-277011-A and clozapine. Additionally, pre-treating clozapine with the D1 antagonist SCH23390 caused a significant, albeit non-complete, reduction in Fos-LI, highlighting the D1 agonist property of clozapine. In conclusion, it appears that drugs occupying >50% D3 receptors produce robust increases in ICjM Fos-LI. This study may help to identify the appropriate D3 receptor antagonists that have the potential to be tested in the clinic.", 
    "110": "The beta-carboline, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), is a potent chemoconvulsant. While it has been utilized in adult rodents, it has not been previously examined for effects across postnatal development. DMCM is a negative allosteric modulator of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors, receptor subtypes that are particularly enriched in limbic brain regions. This raises the possibility that DMCM may be particularly effective at evoking forebrain seizures, which is a challenge in neonatal animals due to the relative immaturity of the forebrain seizure network. The ability to selectebrain seizures is desirable when screening for drugs to use in temporal lobe epilepsy, which is characterized by seizures within the forebrain (limbic) network. To determine the profile of DMCM action across development, we examined the dose-dependent ability of DMCM to induce seizures in rats at P7, P10, P13, P14, P21 and in adulthood. We found that the highest sensitivity to DMCM occurred in P10, P13, and P14 rats. The lowest sensitivity occurred in P21 rats. Neonatal (P7) and adult (P60+) rats displayed moderate sensitivity. With moderate (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) doses of DMCM, we were able to reliably evoke limbic motor seizures without tonic-clonic components in animals as young as P7. These data support the utility of DMCM in assessing seizure threshold during development and raise the possibility for future exploration of DMCM as an agent to screen anticonvulsant drugs during the postnatal period.",

However, the effect of ILTG in GABAAR-mediated synaptic response in brain has not been tested yet. Here we report that ILTG significantly prolonged the decay of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) mediated by GABAAR in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons without affecting amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs. This enhancement was fully inhibited by flumazenil (FLU), a specific GABAA-BZD receptor antagonist.

Here we describe an innovative workflow for the discovery of high affinity ligands for the benzodiazepine-binding site on the so far not crystallized mammalian GABAA receptors. The procedure includes chemical biology techniques that may be generally applied to other proteins. Prerequisites are a ligand that can be chemically modified with cysteine-reactive groups, knowledge of amino acid residues contributing to the drug-binding pocket, and crystal structures either of proteins homologous to the target protein or, better, of the target itself. Part of the protocol is virtual screening that without additional rounds of optimization in many cases results only in low affinity ligands, even when a target protein has been crystallized. Here we show how the integration of functional data into structure-based screening dramatically improves the performance of the virtual screening. Thus, lead compounds with 14 different scaffolds were identified on the basis of an updated structural model of the diazepam-bound state of the GABAA receptor. Some of these compounds show considerable preference for the \u03b13\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA receptor subtype.",

Only haloperidol had higher baseline cytotoxicity than paliperidone. GEE showed the proper exposure time for evaluating the neuroprotection of APDs was 24 h, rather than 48 or 72 h. Paliperidone was superior to other APDs in protecting na\u00efve SH-SY5Y, had the best effect against H2O2-, MPP+-induced cell death, and caused a significantly higher GST, lower HNE and protein carbonyl productions of na\u00efve SH-SY5Y after stressor insults, which may implicate a molecular mechanism underlying its neuroprotective action. Repeated GEE measurements can correct for the correlation among the clusters to obtain a more accurate result for evaluating drug outcome. The interaction between drugs and stressors should be taken into account when determining the neuroprotective effect of APDs against different stressors.

This conceptual evolution should improve the screening of people affected by this chronic and progressive disease associated with a heavy impact on morbidity and mortality. This identification is provided by the clinical interview and examination. Its sensitivity can be improved by questionnaires and biological markers. Damage and related pathologies have to be systematically revealed. In this context, the MoCA test allows the early detection of cognitive disorders. Care management aims for a change in consumption and consists in supporting the patient in his/her approach. Care management should be personalized, appropriated to the patient's informed choice and graded according to disorders' severity. This includes a psychosocial intervention which can be associated with drugs. Abstinence is no longer the only alternative: decreasing consumption with the aim of regulation has been shown interesting in the reduction of harmful consumption. When therapeutic withdrawal turns out to be necessary, use of a treatment should not be systematic. If necessary, benzodiazepines remain the first-line treatment with a limited duration of prescription. According to his/her profile, the patient can receive a long-term treatment to help to maintain abstinence, prevent relapse or reduce consumption.

Here, we investigated whether JM-20 protects against ischemic neuronal damage in vitro and in vivo. The effects of JM-20 were evaluated on hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). For in vivo studies, Wistar rats were subjected 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and oral administration of JM-20 at 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg 1 h following reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after cerebral blood flow restoration, neurological deficits were scored, and the infarct volume, histopathological changes in cortex, number of hippocampal and striatal neurons, and glutamate/aspartate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured. Susceptibility to brain mitochondrial swelling, membrane potential dissipation, H2O2 generation, cytochrome c release, Ca2+ accumulation, and morphological changes in the organelles were assessed 24 h post-ischemia. In vitro, JM-20 (1 and 10 \u03bcM) administered during reperfusion significantly reduced cell death in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD. In vivo, JM-20 treatment (4 and 8 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, edema formation, total infarct volumes and histological alterations in different brain regions. JM-20 treatment also protected brain mitochondria from ischemic damage, most likely by preventing Ca2+ accumulation in organelles. Moreover, an 8-mg/kg JM-20 dose reduced glutamate and aspartate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid and the deleterious effects of MCAo even when delivered 8 h after blood flow restoration. These results suggest that in rats, JM-20 is a robust neuroprotective agent against ischemia/reperfusion injury with a wide therapeutic window. Our findings support the further examination of potential clinical JM-20 use to treat acute ischemic stroke.",

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS) is an especially attractive technique for comprehensive drug screening. The objective was to compare the performances of immunoassay and UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS in terms of scope, flexibility, sensitivity, and reliability of substance identification. A total of 279 post-mortem urine samples were analyzed using a method representative of each technique. The immunoassay method was an Emit II Plus enzyme immunoassay for the following drug groups: amphetamines, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, cannabis, and opiates. The UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS method was a recently published method covering hundreds of drugs: conventional drugs of abuse, abused prescription drugs, and NPS of various classes. UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS produced a lower number of false positive (FP) results for the drug groups covered by immunoassay. Many of the false negative (FN, n\u2009=\u200940) and FP (n\u2009=\u200922) immunoassay results were obviously due to the higher cut-off concentrations and interfering matrix, respectively. Moreover, the wider scope of UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS allowed detection of NPS and prescription drugs. UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS gave FP results related to a few particular substances. The future option of adjusting all compound-specific reporting parameters individually would allow the method's sensitivity and specificity to be fully exploited.",

Similarly, no haplotype association could withstand multiple test correction. Although we could not find a significant influence of ADIPOQ and PPARG on antipsychotic-induced weight gain, our comprehensive examination of these two genes contributes to understanding the biology of this serious side effect.

There are heterozygous and homozygous forms. The diagnosis is usually made based on blood cholesterol levels, clinical signs and family history. Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Effective lowering of LDL-C in FH can prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, however, the disease remains greatly underdiagnosed. The mainstay of pharmacologic therapy in FH patients is high-dose statins, which are often combined with other lipid-lowering agents. The homozygous form is mainly treated with lipid apheresis. Guideline-recommended target levels of LDL-C are often not reached, making new treatment options desirable. Four classes of newer lipid-lowering drugs offer promising advances in treating FH, namely the apolipoprotein-B synthesis inhibitors (mipomersen), the microsomal transfer protein inhibitors (lomitapide), the cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (anacetrapib, evacetrapib) and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab).

We examined doses among 101 methadone-maintained pregnant women 2, 6 and 12 weeks postpartum, and compared the incidence of having doses held for oversedation during pregnancy and postpartum. The average dose at delivery was 83.3mg, and the mean change from delivery to 12 weeks postpartum was -3.7 mg (95% CI -6.3, -1.1). The incidence of oversedation events per 10,000 days was 2.8 among pregnant women and 5.6 for postpartum women (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.04, 95% CI 0.66, 6.28). After adjusting for benzodiazepine prescriptions, the IRR of an oversedation event among postpartum women compared to pregnant women was 1.74 (95% CI 0.56, 5.30). In conclusion, postpartum dose changes were small in a methadone clinic using clinical assessments to determine dose. Although the incidence of oversedation events remained low postpartum, the clinically important but not statistically significant increase in events among postpartum women and those prescribed benzodiazepines requires further research. While there are not yet adequate data to support pre-specified postpartum dose reductions, the findings suggest that more frequent clinical assessments continuing as late as 12 weeks postpartum may be warranted.", 
    "172": "Modern chromatography-based metabolomics measurements generate large amounts of data in the form of abundances of metabolites. An increasingly popular way of representing and analyzing such data is by means of association networks. Ideally, such a network can be interpreted in terms of the underlying biology. A property of chromatography-based metabolomics data is that the measurement error structure is complex: apart from the usual (random) instrumental error there is also correlated measurement error. This is intrinsic to the way the samples are prepared and the analyses are performed and cannot be avoided. The impact of correlated measurement errors on (partial) correlation networks can be large and is not always predictable. The interplay between relative amounts of uncorrelated measurement error, correlated measurement error and biological variation defines this impact. Using chromatography-based time-resolved lipidomics data obtained from a human intervention study we show how partial correlation based association networks are influenced by correlated measurement error. We show how the effect of correlated measurement error on partial correlations is different for direct and indirect associations. For direct associations the correlated measurement error usually has no negative effect on the results, while for indirect associations, depending on the relative size of the correlated measurement error, results can become unreliable. The aim of this paper is to generate awareness of the existence of correlated measurement errors and their influence on association networks. Time series lipidomics data is used for this purpose, as it makes it possible to visually distinguish the correlated measurement error from a biological response. Underestimating the phenomenon of correlated measurement error will result in the suggestion of biologically meaningful results that in reality rest solely on complicated error structures. Using proper experimental designs that allow for the quantification of the size of correlated and uncorrelated errors, can help to identify suspicious connections in association networks constructed from (partial) correlations.", 
    "173": "Herein, we report on the synthesis, spectral, crystallographic and electrochemical properties of a small library of N-substituted 2-ferrocenyl-1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones, designed as novel GABAA benzodiazepine-binding site ligands. The anxiolytic properties of the title compounds were evaluated in several different in\u00a0vivo models, whereas the involvement of the GABAA receptor complex in the activity of the most potent compound, 2-ferrocenyl-3-(4-methoxyphenylethyl)-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one, was inferred from experiments with known GABAA-targeting agents. Ligand docking experiments revealed that the high, dose-dependent, anxiolytic activity of the new compounds might be due to their favorable interactions with the benzodiazepine-binding site of the GABAA receptor complex. The incorporation of the ferrocene core and fine tuning of the distance between the thiazolidinone core and an additional aromatic ring were judged to be crucial structural requirements for the observed anxiolytic effect.", 
    "174": "To assess withdrawal-related adverse event (AE) rates following abrupt clobazam discontinuation in Phase I trials and gradual clobazam tapering (2-3 weeks) following discontinuation from III trials met the criteria for potential/III trials, we evaluated AE data from four multiple-dosage Phase I trials (duration: 8-34 days). Therapeutic (20 and 40 mg/day) and supratherapeutic clobazam dosages (120 and 160 mg/day) were administered. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome enrolled in Phase II (OV-1002) and Phase III (OV-1012) studies (duration \u226415 weeks) and in the open-label extension (OLE) trial OV-1004 (\u22645 years). Potential withdrawal-related AEs were identified by preferred terms, provided that the AEs occurred \u22651 day following and \u226430 days after the last clobazam doses, or were deemed withdrawal symptoms by investigators. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) scale was used to evaluate withdrawal intensity in three of the four Phase I trials. A total of 207 participants in Phase I trials received steady-state clobazam dosages of 20-160 mg/day, 182 received clobazam dosages of \u226540 mg/day, and 94 received clobazam dosages of \u2265120 mg/day. Abrupt clobazam discontinuation led to 193 withdrawal-related AEs for 68 Phase I participants. Nearly 50% of AEs occurred after discontinuation of clobazam dosages of \u2265120 mg/day. Adverse events were mild or moderate and included headache (14% of Phase I participants), insomnia (12.6%), tremor (10.1%), and anxiety (8.7%). The CIWA-B scores varied (range: 0-59). Most scores were <30, indicating possible mild benzodiazepine withdrawal. III trials met the criteria for potential/III patients received clobazam dosages of \u226440 mg/day, and those in the OLE trial received clobazam dosages of \u226480 mg/day. Eighty-seven patients discontinued clobazam and were gradually tapered. No withdrawal-related AEs or incidences of status epilepticus were reported. Withdrawal-related AEs observed in Phase I studies following abrupt clobazam discontinuation at therapeutic and supratherapeutic dosages were generally mild. No withdrawal-related AEs occurred when dosages were tapered over 3 weeks, after short- or long-term clobazam use (\u22645 years).", 
    "175": "There is high comorbidity between depression and addiction. Features of addiction relevant to depression have been studied extensively, but less is known about features of depression relevant to addiction. Here, we have studied the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS), a valid animal model of depression, on measures of physical and psychological dependence resulting from subchronic treatment of rats with three drugs of abuse that act through disparate neurobiological mechanisms: morphine, nicotine and diazepam. In animals not treated subchronically with drugs of abuse, CMS increased the withdrawal-like effects of the opiate antagonist naloxone, but not those of the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine or the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. In animals treated subchronically with drugs of abuse, CMS exacerbated, precipitated and conditioned withdrawal effects associated with all three antagonists. CMS also potentiated withdrawal-induced and cue-induced place aversions associated with all three antagonists. All of the effects of CMS were reversed by chronic treatment with the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram. These results suggest that treatment of comorbid depression, although not a primary treatment for addiction, may facilitate other treatments for addiction, by decreasing the severity of withdrawal symptoms and the likelihood of relapse.", 
    "176": "Previous studies have reported that context can powerfully modulate the inhibitory effect of an antipsychotic drug on phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotion (a behavioral test used to evaluate putative antipsychotic drugs). The present study investigated the experimental conditions under which environmental stimuli exert their influence through associative conditioning processes. Experiment 1 examined the extent to which previous antipsychotic treatment in the home cages affected a drug's ability to inhibit PCP-induced hyperlocomotion in novel motor activity test apparatus. Five days of repeated haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and olanzapine (2.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) treatment in the home cages still potentiated their inhibition of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion (i.e. sensitization) assessed in a new environment, whereas the clozapine (10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) treatment enhanced the development of clozapine tolerance, indicating a lack of environmental modulation of antipsychotic efficacy. Experiment 2 assessed the impact of different numbers of antipsychotic administrations (e.g. 4, 2 or 0), in either the home environment or test environment, on a drug's ability to inhibit PCP-induced hyperlocomotion. Repeated administration of clozapine (5.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) for 4 consecutive days, irrespective of where these treatments occurred, led to a similar level of inhibition of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion. However, 4-day haloperidol (0.03 mg/kg, subcutaneously) treatment in the test apparatus led to significantly higher inhibition than a 4-day home-cage treatment. Thus, more exposures to the test environment under the influence of haloperidol (but not clozapine or olanzapine) caused a stronger inhibition than fewer exposures, indicating a strong environmental modulation. Collectively, these findings suggest that previous antipsychotic treatment in one environment could alter later antipsychotic-like response assessed in a different environment under certain test conditions. Therefore, whether the circumstances surrounding antipsychotic drug administration have a powerful effect on the expression of antipsychotic-like efficacy is dependent on specific experimental and drug treatment factors.", 
    "177": "The term antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) refers to the concurrent use of two or more antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the range of APP in schizophrenic patients discharged from psychiatric units in Poland, and to determine its demographical and clinical correlates.", 
    "178": "Data on the pharmacological treatment of 207 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, discharged from six psychiatric hospitals from September-December 2011 were recorded by experienced psychiatrists. Clinical and demographical information was obtained on each patient. The severity of symptoms at admission, and their improvement during hospitalization were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale.", 
    "179": "At discharge, 52.7% of the patients were prescribed one, 42.5% two and 4.8% three antipsychotic drugs (AP). When two AP were applied, it was usually a combination of two second generation antipsychotics (SGA) (46%), or of both first generation antipsychotics (FGA) and SGA (48%). The SGA's olanzapine and risperidone were those most commonly prescribed. Patients treated with two or more AP had a higher number of previous hospitalizations than patients receiving antipsychotic monotherapy. Mood stabilizers were prescribed for nearly one third of the patients, while antidepressants and benzodiazepines were prescribed for fewer than 10%.", 
    "180": "The prevalence of polypharmacy in Poland is similar to that reported in other countries. This may suggest that, in a substantial proportion of schizophrenic patients clinical response to the antipsychotic monotherapy is unsatisfactory. Further studies focusing on the efficacy and safety of strategies in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia not responding to antipsychotic monotherapy are necessary.",

They are frequently located in subcortical nuclei and usually constitute an incidental finding. This report presents the case of a patient suffering from paranoid schizophrenia for approximately 40 years, who did not agree to any treatment and was hospitalized against her will because she was the threat to the lives of others. She was treated with zuklopentixol resulting in positive symptoms reduction and considerable improvement in social functioning. Unfortunately neurological symptoms appeared: bradykinesis, rigidity--of the type of the lead pipe, balance, posture and gait abnormalities, disturbances in precise hands movements, double-sided Rossolimo's sign, plantar reflex without the participation of the big toe on the left. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated changes in the form of lenticular nuclei calcification and reduction of signal intensity in posterior parts of both putamens. Neurological symptoms decreased significantly after switching to atypical neuroleptic (olanzapine), and the patient did not require any additional treatment. Mineralization of the basal ganglia can often be associated with psychiatric disorders and it shouldn't be neglected because it can require modification of pharmacotherapy or additional neurological treatment.",

We used the Polish version of the CIDI (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) to obtain ICD-10 diagnoses. The intensity of psychopathological symptoms was examined using the PANSS. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with perazine, olanzapine or ziprasidone administered as monotherapy for 3 months. The treatment efficacy was measured as a change in the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) total score from baseline (T0) to 3 months (T1). The WCST (The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) was used to measure working memory and executive functions in the evaluated patients. Wilcoxon's and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to compare changes in the PANSS scores between the treatment groups. To analyze the cognitive functions, Kruskal-Wallis test for the WCST parameters was used.",

    "186": "The progression of epileptiform activity following soman (GD) exposure is characterized by a period of excessive cholinergic activity followed by excessive glutamatergic activity resulting in status epilepticus, which may lead to neuropathological damage and behavioral deficits. Caramiphen edisylate is an anticholinergic drug with antiglutamatergic properties, which conceptually may be a beneficial therapeutic approach to the treatment of nerve agent exposure. In the present study, rats were exposed to 1.2 LD50 GD or saline, treated with atropine sulfate (2mg/kg, im) and HI-6 (93.6mg/kg, im) 1min after GD exposure, and monitored for seizure activity. Rats were treated with diazepam (10mg/kg, sc) and caramiphen (0, 20 or 100mg/kg, im) 30min after seizure onset. Following GD exposure, performance was evaluated using a battery of behavioral tests to assess motor coordination and function, sensorimotor gating, and cognitive function. Caramiphen as adjunct to diazepam treatment attenuated GD-induced seizure activity, neuropathological damage, and cognitive deficits compared to diazepam alone, but did not attenuate the GD-induced sensorimotor gating impairment. These findings show that physiological, behavioral, and neuropathological effects of GD exposure can be attenuated by treatment with caramiphen as an adjunct to therapy, even if administration is delayed to 30min after seizure onset.",

    "192": "Corticosteroids, highly effective drugs for myriad disease states, have considerable neuropsychiatric adverse effects that can manifest in cognitive disorders, behavioral changes, and frank psychiatric disease. Recent reviews have summarized these effects in adults, but a comprehensive review on corticosteroid effects in children has not been published since 2005. Here, we systematically review articles published since then that, we find, naturally divide into 3 main areas: (1) chronic effects of acute prenatal and neonatal exposure associated with prematurity and congenital conditions; (2) immediate behavioral effects of acute exposure via oncological protocols; and (3) acute behavioral effects of sporadic use in children and adolescents with other conditions. PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus were queried to identify articles reporting psychiatric adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients. Search terms included corticosteroids, adrenal cortex hormones, steroid psychosis, substance-induced psychoses, glucocorticoids, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, adverse effects, mood disorders, mental disorders, psychosis, psychotic, psychoses, side effect, chemically induced, emotions, affective symptoms, toxicity, behavior, behavioral symptoms, infant, child, adolescent, pediatric, paediatric, neonatal, children, teen, and teenager. Following guidelines for systematic reviews from the Potsdam Consultation on Meta-Analysis, we have found it difficult to draw specific conclusions that are more than general impressions owing to the quality of the available studies. We find a mixed picture with neonates exposed to dexamethasone, with some articles reporting eventual deficits in neuropsychiatric functioning and others reporting no effect. In pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, corticosteroid use appears to correlate with negative psychiatric and behavioral effects. In children treated with corticosteroids for noncancer conditions, adverse effects have been observed both during treatment and after cessation, although the data from article to article are not consistent enough to establish dose relationships. By and large, inhaled corticosteroids are considered safe and free of severe neuropsychiatric effects. Although both antipsychotic medications and benzodiazepines have been used to treat corticosteroid-induced mania and psychosis, no unified management strategy has emerged. Large-scale standardized investigations are needed to clarify the psychiatric effect of corticosteroids on children in all these conditions. Meanwhile, there is general agreement that patients as well as caregivers should be warned of the potential for behavioral adverse effects when patients receive these drugs.",

A cross-sectional quantitative survey of age, sex, diagnoses, and psychotropic medication of 682 psychiatric inpatients of the 2 national referral hospitals in Uganda was conducted on 1 day in March 2012. The percentage of patients treated with the same substance within the diagnostic categories schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, unspecified psychosis, and depressive disorder was calculated. Close to 90% of the patients with conditions diagnosed with any psychotic disorder were treated with first-generation antipsychotic drugs (eg, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, trifluoperazine, and depot fluphenazine). Carbamazepine in combination with first-generation antipsychotics was prescribed frequently (45%) for the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. The use of second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, and valproic acid was exceptional. Patients with depression usually received a combination (63%) of first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants (fluoxetine or amitriptyline). Benzodiazepines were only infrequently used for patients diagnosed with psychoses. First-generation antipsychotics, antidepressants, and carbamazepine were the most frequently used medications for treatment of psychosis in Uganda. Although lithium and valproic acid were on the essential drug list in Uganda, their use was still infrequent. There is a need to ensure the practical availability of the drugs listed on the essential drug list and to support the implementation of their use in clinical practice.",

In goldfish, intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin A has been shown to affect not only food intake, but also locomotor activity. However, as there is still no information regarding the effect of orexin A on emotional behavior in goldfish, we investigated the effect of orexin A on psychomotor activity in this species. Intracerebroventricular administration of synthetic orexin A at 2 and 4pmol/g body weight (BW) enhanced locomotor activity, and this enhancement by orexin A at 4pmol/g BW was attenuated by treatment with the orexin receptor 1 antagonist, SB334867, at 10pmol/g BW. Since intact goldfish prefer a black to a white background area, or the lower to the upper area of a tank, we used two types of preference tests (black/white and upper/lower tests) for measuring anxiety-like behavior in goldfish. Intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A at 4pmol/g BW shortened the time spent in the white background area, and increased the time taken to move from the lower to the upper area. This action of orexin A mimicked that of the central-type benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, FG-7142 (an anxiogenic agent), at 4pmol/g BW. The anxiogenic-like effect of orexin A was abolished by treatment with SB334867 at 10pmol/g BW. These results indicate that orexin A potently affects psychomotor activity in goldfish.",

Previous research on TSPO was based entirely on in vitro experiments, and its critical role was reinforced by an early report that claimed TSPO knock-out mice were embryonic lethal. In a previous publication, we examined Leydig cell-specific TSPO conditional knock-out mice that suggested TSPO was not required for testosterone production in vivo. This raised controversy and several questions regarding TSPO function. To examine the definitive role of TSPO in steroidogenesis and embryo development, we generated global TSPO null (Tspo(-/-)) mice. Contrary to the early report, Tspo(-/-) mice survived with no apparent phenotypic abnormalities and were fertile. Examination of adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis showed no defects in Tspo(-/-) mice. Adrenal transcriptome comparison of gene expression profiles showed that genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis (Star, Cyp11a1, and Hsd3b1) were unchanged in Tspo(-/-) mice. Adrenocortical ultrastructure illustrated no morphological alterations in Tspo(-/-) mice. In an attempt to correlate our in vivo findings to previously used in vitro models, we also determined that siRNA knockdown or the absence of TSPO in different mouse and human steroidogenic cell lines had no effect on steroidogenesis. These findings directly refute the dogma that TSPO is indispensable for steroid hormone biosynthesis and viability. By amending the current model, this study advances our understanding of steroidogenesis with broad implications in biology and medicine.",

    "224": "Diazepam rectal gel (RG) is currently the only approved rescue therapy for outpatient management of seizure clusters in the United States. There is an unmet medical need for an alternative rescue therapy for seizure clusters that is effective, and more convenient to administer with a socially acceptable method of delivery. An intranasal diazepam formulation has been developed, and this study evaluates the tolerability and bioavailability of diazepam nasal spray (NS) relative to an equivalent dose of diazepam-RG in healthy adults. Twenty-four healthy adults were enrolled in a phase 1, open-label, 3-period crossover study. Plasma diazepam and metabolite concentrations were measured by serial sampling. Dose proportionality for 5- and 20-mg intranasal doses and the bioavailability of 20mg diazepam-NS relative to 20mg diazepam-RG were assessed by maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure parameters (AUC0-\u221e and AUC0-24). The mean Cmax values for 20mg diazepam-NS and 20mg diazepam-RG were 378 \u00b1 106 and 328 \u00b1 152 ng/mL, achieved at 1.0 and 1.5h, respectively. Subjects administered intranasal and rectal gel formulations experienced nasal and rectal leakage, respectively. Diazepam absorption following intranasal administration was consistent but 3 subjects with diazepam-RG had low plasma drug levels at the earliest assessment of 5 min, due to poor retention, and were excluded from analysis. Excluding them, the treatment ratios (20mg diazepam-NS:20mg diazepam-RG) and 90% confidence intervals for diazepam Cmax and AUC0-24 were 0.98 (0.85-1.14) and 0.89 (0.80-0.98), respectively, suggesting that the bioavailability was comparable between the two formulations. Dose proportionality was observed between the lowest and highest dose-strengths of intranasal formulation. Both intranasal and rectal treatments were well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse events. Results suggest that a single-dose of 20mg diazepam-NS is tolerable and comparable in bioavailability to that of diazepam-RG. The intranasal formulation may provide caregivers and patients with a more socially acceptable and convenient alternative rescue therapy in the acute treatment of seizure clusters.", 
    "225": "Severe tetanus remains a serious issue in less developed countries, leading to prolonged hospitalization due to prolonged neuromuscular contraction of muscles. We present a case of severe tetanus in the United States that was successfully managed with intrathecal baclofen.", 
    "226": "A 42-year-old male without tetanus vaccination history presented to the emergency department with intractable jaw pain and worsening diffuse muscle contractures due to severe generalized tetanus requiring prolonged paralysis and ventilator support. After 14 days of continuous neuromuscular treatment with benzodiazepines, vecuronium, propofol, and magnesium sulfate, a baclofen pump trial was performed 14 days post-admission as an alternative to prolonged neuromuscular blockade. After demonstrable improvement in spasms and paroxysmal contractures due to intrathecal baclofen (ITB), a baclofen pump was implanted on hospital day 17. The catheter was threaded to T4 for maximal effect of intrathecal baclofen on the upper and lower extremities at an initial rate of 100\u2009\u03bcg/day. ITB was titrated upward, the vecuronium was slowly weaned, and the patient was weaned off a ventilator by day 14 of ITB treatment. At an ITB dose of 450\u2009\u03bcg/day, propofol was discontinued. ITB was continued over the next four weeks and eventually weaned over the next two weeks. The ITB pump was removed eight weeks after placement, and the patient was successfully discharged to home.", 
    "227": "Due to prolonged muscle weakness associated with long-term use of paralytic agents and sedation, early ITB trial and pump placement should be considered as an alternative in the treatment of severe tetanus to shorten length of stay and improve the functional outcome of the patient.", 
    "228": "Human serum paraoxonase (PON1, EC 3.1.8.1.) is a high-density lipid (HDL)-associated, calcium-dependent enzyme. In this study, the effects of Haloperidol, Fluoxetine hydrochloride, Diazepam and Acepromazine drugs used for the therapy of antidepressant and antipsychotic diseases, on paraoxonase enzyme activity was studied in in vitro inhibition studies on purified human serum PON1. PON1 enzyme was purified from human blood using two-step procedures, namely, ammonium sulfate precipitation and sepharose-4B-l-tyrosine-1-napthylamine hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The overall purification of human serum PON1 was obtained in a activity of 109.29 U/mL and this enzyme was purified 125-fold. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme indicates a single band with an apparent MW of 43\u2009kDa. Inhibition studies indicated that haloperidol and fluoxetine hydrocloride were effective inhibitors on purified human serum PON1 activity with IC50 of 0.187 and 3.08\u2009mM values, respectively. The kinetics of interaction of haloperidol and fluoxetine hydrocloride with the purified human serum PON1 indicated uncompetitive inhibiton pattern with Ki of 4.15 and 0.007\u2009mM, respectively.", 
    "229": "The \"z-drugs\" zopiclone, zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon were introduced in the 1980s for the treatment of insomnia, as it was observed that the side effect profile associated with these medications were more benign than those related to the benzodiazepines. This meta-analysis set out to ascertain which domains of cognitive function, if any, were affected by the ingestion of these medications. A total of 20 studies met the study inclusion criteria. Results revealed medium effect sizes for zopiclone and zolpidem on measures of verbal memory. An additional medium effect size was observed for zolpidem on attention. Finally, smaller effect sizes were observed for zolpidem speed of processing and for zopiclone on working memory. It is clear from these data that the use of a single dose of the z-drugs in healthy adults as measured in the morning following the exposure does produce a specific rather than a generalized negative effect on cognitive function. However, there were only enough studies to evaluate the individual cognitive effects of the zolpidem and zopiclone medications; the specific effects of zaleplon and eszopiclone cannot be ascertained because only one study met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review.", 
    "230": "We assessed clinical and early electrophysiological characteristics, in particular Generalized Periodic Epileptiform Discharges (GPEDs) patterns, of consecutive patients during a 1-year period, hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after resuscitation following cardiac arrest (CA).", 
    "231": "Consecutive patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA) with first EEG recordings within 48hours were included. Clinical data were collected from hospital records, in particular therapeutic hypothermia. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were re-analyzed retrospectively.", 
    "232": "Sixty-two patients were included. Forty-two patients (68%) were treated with therapeutic hypothermia according to international guidelines. Global mortality was 74% but not significantly different between patients who benefited from therapeutic hypothermia compared to those who did not. All the patients who did not have an initial background activity (36/62; 58%) died. By contrast, initial background activity was present in 26/62 (42%) and among these patients, 16/26 (61%) survived. Electroencephalography demonstrated GPEDs patterns in 5 patients, all treated by therapeutic hypothermia and antiepileptic drugs. One of these survived and showed persistent background activity with responsiveness to benzodiazepine intravenous injection.",

    "234": "The primary aim of the present study was to assess the possible associations between dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic system-related genes and adverse events after antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients. The second aim of the study was to compare the intensity of these symptoms between atypical (ziprasidone and olanzapine) and typical (perazine) antipsychotic drugs. One-hundred and ninety-one Polish patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia were genotyped for polymorphisms of DRD2, DAT1, COMT, MAOA, SERT, 5HT2A, and GRIK3. The patients were randomized to treatment with perazine, olanzapine or ziprasidone monotherapy for 3 months. The intensity of side effects (changes in body weights and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)) was measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. After 3 months of therapy, the weight increase was the greatest in the group treated with olanzapine and the least in the group treated with ziprasidone. None of the examined gene polymorphisms was associated with the body weight changes. Perazine treatment was associated with the significantly highest intensity of EPS. None of the examined polymorphisms was associated with the changes in extrapyramidal adverse events after antipsychotic treatment. The selected polymorphisms are not primarily involved in changes in body weights and EPS related to antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients.",

The effect of high-dose folic acid (5\u2009mg) advised to women at risk for having a child with neural tube defect has not been assessed so far. Our aim was to investigate the effect of dispensed high-dose folic acid during pregnancy and asthma medication in the offspring.", 
    "236": "We used data from the pregnancy database IADB.nl, which contains pharmacy-dispensing data of mothers and children from community pharmacies in the Netherlands from 1994 until 2011. The dispension of asthma medication in children exposed in utero to high-dose folic acid was compared with children who were not exposed to this high dose. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.", 
    "237": "In 2.9% (N\u2009=\u2009913) of the 39,602 pregnancies in the database, the mother was dispensed high-dose folic acid. Maternal high-dose folic acid was associated with an increased rate of asthma medication among children: recurrent asthma medication IRR\u2009=\u20091.14 (95%CI: 1.04-1.30) and recurrent inhaled corticosteroids IRR\u2009=\u20091.26 (95%CI: 1.07-1.47). Associations were clustered on the mother and adjusted for maternal age, maternal asthma medication, and dispension of benzodiazepines during pregnancy.", 
    "238": "Almost 3% of the children were prenatally exposed to high-dose folic acid. This study suggests that supplementation of high-dose folic acid during pregnancy might increase the risk of childhood asthma.", 
    "239": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are widely used in the treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions including anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. BZDs are thought to act predominantly by affecting the gating of GABAA receptor channels, resulting in enhanced GABA-mediated currents in neurons. However, mutations mimicking the effect of BZDs on GABAAR channel gating have been shown to also impact the membrane dynamics and synaptic anchoring of the receptors. Here, using single molecule tracking combined with electrophysiological recordings, we show that BZD ligands rapidly influence the dynamic behavior of GABAARs in hippocampal neurons. Application of the inverse BZD agonist DMCM rapidly increased the diffusion and reduced the clustering of GABAARs at synapses, resulting in reduced postsynaptic currents. Conversely, the BZD full agonist diazepam had little effect at rest but reduced lateral diffusion and increased synaptic stabilization and clustering of GABAARs upon sustained neuronal activity, resulting in enhanced potency of inhibitory synapses. These effects occurred in the absence of detectable changes in gephyrin clusters, suggesting they did not reflect a rapid dispersion of the synaptic scaffold. Thus, alterations of the diffusion and synaptic anchoring of GABAARs represent a novel, unsuspected mechanism through which BZDs rapidly modulate GABA signaling in central neurons.", 
    "240": "Psychosis and other mental illnesses are common in HIV-infected patients. Olanzapine is one of the preferred antipsychotic agents for the treatment of schizophrenia. Olanzapine is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). High-dose ritonavir has been shown to increase olanzapine elimination through induction of CYP1A2 and/or UGT, but the effect of low-dose ritonavir on olanzapine pharmacokinetics is unknown. Fosamprenavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that is boosted by low-dose ritonavir. To compensate for the induction of olanzapine metabolism by fosamprenavir/ritonavir, we hypothesised that a dose increase of olanzapine to 15 mg with fosamprenavir/ritonavir would lead to a similar area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) compared with olanzapine 10 mg alone. An open-label, randomised, two-period, cross-over, single-centre trial was conducted in 24 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomised to one of the following treatments: (A) fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 16 days with a single dose of olanzapine 15 mg on Day 13, a wash-out period of 31 days and a single dose of olanzapine 10 mg on Day 48; or (B) the same medication in reverse order. Twenty subjects completed the trial. The geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of olanzapine AUClast, maximum drug concentration (C(max)) and apparent elimination half-life (t(1/2)) when taken with fosamprenavir/ritonavir versus olanzapine alone were 1.00 (0.93-1.08), 1.32 (1.18-1.47) and 0.68 (0.63-0.74), respectively. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100 mg b.i.d. appeared to induce olanzapine metabolism. We therefore propose a 50% dosage increase of olanzapine when combining with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor.",

    "242": "Two hundred and sixty patients [M:F - 194:66] with HWE were recruited. Patients were divided into: (a) 'HWE alone' (n=198) - received intermittent clobazam prophylaxis, 1-1\u00bdh prior to hot water head bath (group A); (b) 62 patients (20.4%) with 'HWE with spontaneous seizures were treated with continuous AEDs along with intermittent clobazam therapy (group B).", 
    "243": "Patients (n=198) in group A was followed for mean of 17.6 \u00b1 10.6 months (range: 3-57). One hundred and forty seven patients (74.2%) had excellent response with complete seizure freedom with clobazam therapy while 12 (6.1%) had >75% reduction in seizure frequency. Remaining 39 (19.7%) required additional standard AED along with clobazam and 18 patients among them developed spontaneous/unprovoked seizure at follow up of 6.7 \u00b1 4.1 months. Forty five patients in group B were seizure free while on continuous AEDs.",

    "246": "The extent of binding of (14)C-labeled deltamethrin (DLM), cis-permethrin (CIS) and trans-permethrin (TRANS) was quantified by a 3-step organic solvent extraction technique. Rat and human plasma samples, containing NaF to inhibit esterases, were spiked with a range of concentrations of each radiolabeled pyrethroid. Protein binding reached equilibrium within ~1h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. The samples were extracted in turn with: isooctane to collect the unbound fraction; 2-octanol to extract the lipoprotein-bound fraction; and acetonitrile to obtain the protein-bound fraction.", 
    "247": "Absolute recoveries of DLM, CIS and TRANS ranged from 86 to 95%. Adherence of these very lipophilic chemicals to glass and plastic was minimized by using silanized glass vials and LoBind\u00ae plastic pipettes. The method's ability to distinguish lipoprotein from protein binding was confirmed by experiments with diazepam and cyclosporine, drugs that bind selectively to albumin and lipoproteins, respectively.", 
    "248": "This procedure was effectively utilized for studies of the species-dependence of plasma protein and lipoprotein binding of three pyrethroids for inclusion in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models of pyrethroids for use in health risk assessments of the insecticides in children and adults."
