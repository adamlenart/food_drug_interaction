    "0": "12 patients admitted for neurological diseases and suffering from sleep disturbances, were given Flunitrazepam and placebo (double blind test) in a single evening dose of 1 and 2 mg. Morning recordings of the expectation wave according to G. Walter's technique did not reveal significant changes in wave morphology, amplitude and latency. The psychophysical conditions of patients and their reaction times did not differ after Flunitrazepam and placebo. The research shows, on the one hand the value of the electrophysiological investigation method and, on the other, the absence of residual effects in the morning after Flunitrazepam administration.", 
    "1": "Between 1 January and 31 December 1978, there were 723 episodes of overdosage, poisoning, self-inflicted injury and other possible manifestations of parasuicide reported by the casualty and trauma units of Addington Hospital, Durban. The Department of Psychiatry at this hospital attended to 310 of the patients involved. The study represents an analysis of their characteristics, which might indicate those at greatest risk of parasuicide. Some of the more relevant findings include the following: women predominated, those most at risk were in the age group 20--29 years, and single people were more at risk. The most common method of parasuicide was the ingestion of benzodiazepines and analgesics. A seasonal fluctuation was noted with a referral peak during the summer months, viz. December--February. Transient situational disturbances, reactive depression and conduct disorders in adolescents were the most prevalent psychiatric diagnoses.", 
    "2": "The performance of a number of liquid--solid systems, consisting of mixtures of buffers (0.05 M) and methanol as mobile phase and methyl-silica as stationary phase, were investigated with respect to their use in the separation of 1,4-benzodiazepines by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection at 254 nm. Phase system selectivities and column efficiencies were determined. A nomogram is presented from which the chromatographic parameters can be calculated. A complete separation of nine benzodiazepines within 12 min has been achieved, using methyl-silica as the stationary phase and 50% methanol as the eluent. The results were applied to the development of a method for the determination of therapeutic levels of diazepam and its metabolites in human serum, urine and saliva. The first step in the analysis, the extraction of diazepam and its metabolites from serum and urine, was also investigated and good recoveries were achieved. A low detection limit (0.2 ng) and high precision were obtained. The concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites in human serum, urine and saliva were determined after both single and multiple oral doses of diazepam (and oxazepam).", 
    "3": "Based upon suggestions of Lader (1976) about a diagnostic scale of various anxiety states it is discussed if beta-blockers influence mainly the peripheric vegetative symptoms of anxiety and stress and tranquilizers mainly cognitive anxiety. Results of a study in 51 labile volunteers between 19 and 26 years of age are reported. After a six weeks treatment with pindolol compared to chlordiazepoxide and placebo a significant reduction of trait anxiety after beta-blocker treatment was observed. These effects resembled those usually seen after tranquilizer application.", 
    "4": "In view of its anticonvulsant effects in the experimental animal, its low toxicity, and its manageability, Althesin was used at doses of 80-600 mg in the treatment of barbiturate and benzodiazepine resistant epilepsy in 11 patients aged 15 months to 62 yr. Lasting suspension of the disease was obtained in 8 subjects. Burst suppression was achieved in 7 of these cases with 80-120 drops/min of a 10% solution of Althesin in 10% laevulose. No side-effects were observed.", 
    "5": "The effect of diazepam on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure was studied in a controlled randomized double-blind protocol. Twenty-five patients received intravenous saline, diazepam 5 mg. and diazepam 10 mg. on different days. Diazepam 5 mg. and diazepam 10 mg. caused a mean peak reduction in LES pressure of 18.9 and 37.8% respectively. The peak reduction in LES pressure was dose-related and lasted approximately seven minutes. Awareness of diazepam's ability to significantly lower LES pressure is needed to avoid the possibility of falsely diagnosing reflux by endoscopy. The mechanism whereby diazepam lowers LES pressure is not known, however, diazepam may be acting as a smooth muscle relaxant since myogenic influences have been implicated in the genesis of LES pressure.", 
    "6": "The equal legal of prescription of Chlormethiazol and a combination of Methophenazin and Chlordiazepoxid is demonstrated by a catamnestic examination of 52 patients with predelirant syndroms. In this way it will be shown a practicable way of an efficiently used of medicine treatment by patients with a predelirant syndrom in the out-patient department of practitioners and nerve specialists.", 
    "7": "Astrocytes in primary cultures were found to bind large amounts of [3H]diazepam. More than 90% of the total binding is specific, i.e., displaceable by an excess of nonlabeled diazepam. At saturation the specific binding amounts to about 20 pmol/mg protein and the Kd value is 30 nM. Clonazepam and flurazepam displace [3H]diazepam from its specific binding sites; 20-30% displacement is brought about by 0.1-0.3 microM clonazepam, which is similar to the plasma concentrations encountered in epileptic patients treated with this drug. Barbiturates have a similar effect, but considerably higher concentrations are required.", 
    "8": "Injections of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into spinal motoneurons (in cats under Dial) induce a small but relatively prolonged hyperpolarization (mean - 1.7 mV, SD 2.1; n = 25) which is associated with a rise in input resistance (mean 44%, SD 122; n = 34), is not reversed by hyperpolarization, and is not potentiated by intracellular release of benzodiazepines. Muscimol sometimes has a comparable effect, but alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and glycine do not. These observations are consistent with the possibility that motoneurons have a Na+-coupled GABA transport mechanism that is electrogenic and can be reversed by an excess of intracellular GABA.", 
    "9": "A new, sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for chlordiazepoxide was used to determine concentrations of the drug in microsamples of saliva and plasma obtained from subjects following intravenous and oral administration of the drug. Saliva and plasma concentrations of the drug were highly correlated (r = 0.95) and the saliva/plasma ratio had a mean value of about 0.03. Saliva levels of chlordiazepoxide were found to be equal to the concentration of unbound drug in the plasma. Drug half-lives determined from both plasma and saliva concentration-time curves were found to be equivalent.", 
    "10": "Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) have been formulated for the activities of a series of benzodiazepines in rats. The lipophilic character of molecules was expressed by means of the chromatographic Rm values which were very well correlated with experimental or calculated log P values. The ideal lipophilic character for activity of benzodiazepines in the exploratory behavior test is not far from that of compounds acting in the central nervous system as unspecific depressant agents. The results of both the conflict and exploratory behavior studies might support the hypothesis of different sites of action for the antianxiety and sedative effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "11": "The singlet resonance due to the two equivalent methyl groups of amitriptyline hydrochloride in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 solution changed into a doublet with the addition of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride. A spin decoupling experiment revealed that the double originated because of the emergence of observable spin--spin coupling between the tertiary amine proton and the methyl groups. The phenomenon was interpreted to be due to the nature of proton transfer caused by the relative magnitudes of the basicities of the amines in these compounds, which were determined by the inductive and steric effects of the substituents, leading to the formation of hydrogen-bonded ion-pairs in the aprotic diluent. The enthalpy of the exchange process was 6.4 +/- 0.5 kcal/mole.", 
    "12": "A rapid, precise, and accurate high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure is presented for the stimultaneous determination of amitriptyline hydrochloride and chlordiazepoxide in two-component tablet formulations. The impurities and decomposition products of both components were separated, making the determination specific for amitriptyline hydrochloride and chlordiazepoxide. The method was used for the assay, content uniformity, and dissolution testing of dosage forms containing 5--30 mg of chlordiazepoxide and 12.5--75 mg of amitriptyline.", 
    "13": "Nocturnal myoclonus has been identified as a cause of disturbed sleep and excessive daytime fatigue. To our knowledge, no therapy has heretofore been available to adequately control this problem. We identified this problem clinically in two patients; in one, the phenomenon was observed with a polygraphic sleep recording. Small doses of clonazepam, 1 mg, before retiring were found to specifically control the myoclonus and allow sleep patterns to return to normal.", 
    "14": "We report on 4 patients with fracture of the penis who were managed conservatively with oxyphenbutazone and diazepam. All of our patients recovered completely within 6 to 8 weeks.", 
    "15": "Seventeen children (age range 2 weeks to 15 years) who developed status epilepticus were treated with intravenous clonazepam (Rivotril). Status was promptly stopped in each instance with between 0.25 to 0.75 mg clonazepam. In 6 children who had a further episode of status epilepticus, diazepam 0.25 to 0.75 mg/kg was given. A comparison of their relative efficacy showed that in each case clonazepam had a more prolonged action. No serious side effects occurred and it was felt that i.v. clonazepam, because of its more prolonged action, could be the drug of choice in controlling status epilepticus.", 
    "16": "The authors performed a bioassay of midazolam maleate, an investigational, water-soluble benzodiazepine; to determine the duration of sleep after a single intravenous dose. Sodium thiopental was the standard against which the midazolam maleate was assayed. Prior to operation 60 surgical patients were randomly given one of five doses of drugs, either thiopental, 180 or 270 mg, or midazolam maleate, 6.6, 10, or 15 mg. The designated drug was infused intravenously over 20 sec in a double-blind fashion. Sleep was defined as commencing when the patients stopped counting, and ending when they could respond appropriately to verbal commands. Midazolam maleate, 10 mg (9--12 mg represents 95 per cent confidence limits), was found to be equivalent to thiopental, 200 mg, in the duration of sleep induced. Apnea following the infusion was less frequent and of shorter duration after midazolam maleate than after thiopental. It is concluded that midazolam maleate is a satisfactory agent for the induction of anesthesia, and that it is about 20 times as potent as thiopental.", 
    "17": "The benzodiazepine receptor was localized in rat brain with light microscopic autoradiographic methods. The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to slide-mounted tissue sections had all of the characteristics associated with the benzodiazepine receptor. It was saturable, or a high affinity, affected by chloride ion and gamma-aminobutyric acid and showed an appropriate pharmacology. Autoradiograms were generated by the apposition of emulsion-coated coverslips. Receptor distribution showed striking variation throughout the brain and spinal cord. Some areas showing high densities include the cerebral cortex, the molecular layer of the cerebellum, parts of the limbic system, olfactory bulb and hypothalamus and substantiae gelatinosae of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and spinal cord. White matter areas showed negligible levels of receptor. These localizations show which parts of the brain are affected by benzodiazepine administration and contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of the well-known properties of the drugs such as their anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects.", 
    "18": "Chlordiazepoxide and GABA (5 X 10(-5) M; 0.2 microliters) applied into the nucleus raphe dorsalis significantly reduced behavioral suppression induced in rats by a 10-min presentation of a signal previously associated with the punishment of lever pressing for food. As compared to saline control rats, this reduction was of the same order of magnitude as that obtained after intraperitoneal administration of chlordiazepoxide (8 mg X kg-1). Chlordiazepoxide or GABA (5 X 10(-5) M) failed to alter response maintained under non-aversive conditions. These data suggest the involvement of GABAergic neurons of the raphe dorsalis in the 'disinhibitory' effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "19": "Flurazepam, 30 mg, was not more effective in inducing sleep than placebo. Barbiturates (100 mg amobarbital plus 100 mg secobarbital) were more effective in inducing and maintaining sleep than flurazepam or placebo. Contrary to work conducted in the sleep laboratory, the barbiturate hypnotics were still effective on the 14th night. Insomniacs performed poorly on psychomotor tests, but as a group they did not show statistically significant psychomotor impairment after the use of the hypnotics.", 
    "20": "Sequelae of early versus late extubation of the trachea in patients following coronary-artery bypass grafting were compared prospectively in 38 patients randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The times to extubation were 2 +/- 2 and 18 +/- 3 hours after operation for the two groups. Comparisons were made between groups for the following five variables: time spent in the intensive care unit; drug utilization in the intensive care unit; cardiopulmonary morbidity; hemodynamic performance; patient stress (plasma norepinephrine levels). The anesthetic technique consisted of induction with thiopental, nitrous oxide, and halothane, followed by maintenance with nitrous oxide and halothane. Pancuronium was the only muscle relaxant administered. Patients whose tracheas were extubated early had muscle relaxants reversed prior to the application of extubation criteria. There was no significant difference between the groups in times spent in the intensive care unit, hemodynamic performances, or plasma norepinephrine levels; however, the patients whose tracheas were extubated early received less morphine and diazepam and suffered significantly less cardiopulmonary morbidity.", 
    "21": "There are few published reports of complications following intravenous diazepam administration. However, more than 200 cases were reported to the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare during a 7-year period. The systemic complications have been categorized by the authors, and common contributing factors are emphasized. The information obtained from these reports provides further knowledge of both the avoidance and the treatment of such complications and emphasizes the importance of reporting the adverse effects of any drug to a central body.", 
    "22": "Saliva samples were obtained from 25 hospital inpatients (14 males, 11 females, aged 19 to 79 years) taking diazepam (6 to 45 mg) daily. Despite interindividual variations in pharmacokinetics, a correlation was found between both dose and salivary diazepam concentration (r = 0.54, P less than 0.01) and dose and salivary N-desmethyldiazepam concentration (r = 0.78, P = 0.01). The correlation between the salivary concentration of diazepam and that of its metabolite is good (r = 0.76, P less than 0.01). The slope of this linear regression, 1.58, reflects the relative clearances of the metabolite and parent drug and agrees with the theoretical value, 1.60, obtained by calculation using known plasma pharmacokinetic and protein-binding parameters. There is a weak linear correlation of steady-state salivary benzodiazepine (drug and metabolite) concentration per milligram dose and age (r = 0.37, P less than 0.01).", 
    "23": "[3H]Diazepam binds to membrane preparations of the retina, suggesting that benzodiazepine receptors exist in this tissue. The binding characteristics are similar to those known to occur in the brain, with affinity constants in the same range. Unlike the finding in the brain, [3H]diazepam binding in the retina is not stimulated by GABA and other GABA agonists. These findings indicate that benzodiazepine receptors may have a more general function and not only be associated with anxiety or emotional behaviour.", 
    "24": "The influence of frequently used sedatives--Diazepam, Flunitrazepam and Benzoctamin--on blood gases in studied in three groups of patients. The application isn't done as bolus injection but continuously by addition of the drugs in 500 ml physiological NaCl-Solution. In the Benzodiazepin groups the lung function is tested by different parameters. The results show no influence on blood gases nor lung function by this method. Therefore, the continuous application has obvious advantages versus bolus injection.", 
    "25": "1. The metabolism of a peptido-aminobenzophenone (2-o-chlorobenzoyl-4-chloro-N-methyl-N'-glycyl-glycinanilide) (I) was investigated in dogs after oral administration of 50 mg/kg. 2. Metabolites from urine and plasma extracts were identified by g.l.c., t.l.c., and g.l.c.-mass spectrometry. 3. Metabolites identified in the urine were chlorodiazepam (IV), chlorodesmethyldiazepam (III), lorazepam (II), an oxalanilic acid derivative (X). In the plasma, III and IV were detected. 4. The major urinary metabolite was a lorazepam conjugate. 5. A possible main metabolic pathway of I involves formation of the desglycyl compound (XII) via hydrolysis of the terminal amino acid and cyclization to the benzodiazepine type followed by demethylation, 3-hydroxylation and finally conjugation. 6. Formation of the oxanilic acid derivative X from I was a minor route.", 
    "26": "Brain distribution and various pharmacological effects of clobazam and diazepam were studied in rats. When given at 10 mg/kg i.p. the compounds reached peak brain levels 15 min after injection, and showed similar half lives. At peak time brain levels were proportional to the dose administered. Very little of the N-desmethylmetabolite of each compound was found in the brain. Clobazam was less effective than diazepam in protecting rats from pentetrazol convulsions. Disrupting rota-rod performance and increasing punished responses in a \"conflict\" test, the relative potencies ranging from 4 to 8 in the various tests. The results are discussed in relation to the importance of animal species selection for predicting favourable therapeutic effects in humans.", 
    "27": "The antileptazol effect of clobazam lasts longer in the mouse than in the rat. After intraperitoneal injection of clobazam (10 mg kg-1) plasma and brain concentrations of the drug and its rate of disappearance were similar in both species, whereas the metabolite N-demethylclobazam was present at higher concentrations and for longer in the mouse than in the rat. Although the exact contribution of the N-desmethylclobazam to the anticonvulsant effect of clobazam cannot be assessed, the longer duration in mice than in rats seems to be associated with different brain accumulations of the metabolite.", 
    "28": "The hypnotic effect and tolerance of zopiclone 7.5 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg, flurazepam 30 mg, flunitrazepam 2 mg and placebo were compared in a one-night double blind study in 414 hospitalised patients who were to undergo an operation on the following day. Zopiclone was slightly superior to nitrazepam but was inferior both to flurazepam and flunitrazepam. All the active drugs differed clearly from placebo. The results from a subset of patients, excluding those who felt anxious either before treatment on the evening prior to the operation or on the following morning, were analysed separately. All the active products differed significantly from placebo; zopiclone was slightly less effective than the three benzodiazepines. All the benzodiazepines decreased the percentage of patients feeling anxious about the operation by about 25%, zopiclone by about 10% and placebo did not change it at all.", 
    "29": "Suppression of 11-hydroxycorticosteroids (11-OHCS) release with dexamethasone (0.5 mg) has been investigated in 52 patients with endogenous depression and also in normals and in patients with other mental diseases. The suppression was considerably less in depressives (-19 +/- 5%) than in control groups (approx. -60%). The dexamethasone test indices were normalized during remission. The elucidate mechanisms of the dexamethasone inhibiting effect, the influence of tryptophan, DOPA and benzodiazepines on the 11-OHCS level and the degree of its suppression with dexamethasone have been studied. The data indicate a dual effect of serotonin on the regulation of the adrenal function: it stimulates CRF secretion and increases the inhibiting effect of corticosteroids on CRF release. It is suggested that during depression the negative feedback is disturbed in the system - brain monoamines-glucocorticoids. The possible role of this impairment in depression pathogenesis is considered.", 
    "30": "Autoradiographic localization of [3H]flunitrazepam in nuclei of the rat cerebral cortex was further confirmed by biochemical analysis of specific nuclear binding. Highly purified rat cerebral cortex nuclei were shown to bind [3H]flunitrazepam specifically. The Kd(app) for nuclear binding was 28 nM for the nuclei compared with a Kd(app) of 1.1 nM for binding of [3H] flunitrazepam to synaptosomal membrane fractions of the same tissue. Inhibition of the nuclear binding with inosine and hypoxanthine was greater than inhibition of the synaptic membrane fractions. These results lead to to conclude that specific binding may occur at both the synaptic membrane and the nuclear levels and that different endogenous ligands may compete at each site for binding. Furthermore, the possibility exists for translocation and alteration of the bound ligand complex from membrane site to nuclear site.", 
    "31": "1 The effect of intravenous administration of 100 units of heparin on plasma of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam and lorazepam was examined in fourteen normal subjects and five patients with cirrhosis. 2 In normal non-fasted subjects heparin caused a rapid 150--250% rise in the free fraction of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and oxazepam but no change of lorazepam. The changes in free fraction were slightly smaller, but still significant, when the subjects were fasted. 3 These change in free fraction occurred within 90 s of administration of heparin and binding had returned to baseline by 30 to 45 min. 4 In the cirrhotic subjects the response to heparin was variable. 5 The use of heparin during drug disposition studies may affect the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters and possibly pharmacological effects which are dependent on the circulating unbound drug level.", 
    "32": "In a prospective study of drug overdose patients admitted to emergency rooms of 21 Toronto hospitals, 39% said they had taken a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines were used more frequently by females than males and by suburban than core hospital patients. Patients who overdosed on benzodiazepines were admitted to the hospital less frequently and arrived with less disturbance of consciousness than those who had used other drugs. Patterns of prescription in Ontario and patterns of overdose in Metropolitan Toronto were highly correlated.", 
    "33": "A randiomized, controlled trial was performed on 50 patients to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the intravenous injection of diazepam (Valium) plus local anaesthetic spray with those of general anaesthesia (methohexital (Brietal) plus succinylcholine (Scoline)) for gastroduodenoscopy. Careful records were kept of blood pressure, pulse rate nd ECG recordings before, during and after the procedure. In addition, the time taken to perform the procedure, the ease with which it was performed, and an interview with the patients before they left the hospital were recorded. Both procedures have advantages and disadvantges. While there is still a role for general anaesthesia when the endoscopist uses the large types of gastroduodenoscope, the advent of the more sophisticated paediatric endoscopes currently available makes it likely that in future general anaesthesia will rarely be necessary.", 
    "34": "Two commercially available blood collection systems (Venoject and Vacutainer) were investigated for their effect on the plasma concentrations of a variety of drugs. Vacutainer tubes adversely affected the following drugs: propranolol, penbutolol and quinidine, whereas Venoject tubes had no effect on the plasma concentrations of these drugs. Neither collection system had any effect on the plasma concentrations of the following drugs: acebutolol, the main metabolite of acebutolol (DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-acetamidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane), diazepam, N-demethyldiazepam, digoxin, ethosuximide, salicylic acid, valproic acid, warfarin and carbamazepine.", 
    "35": "Investigation of the actions of the benzodiazepines has provided insights into the neurochemical mechanisms underlying anxiety, seizures, muscle relaxation, and sedation. Behavioral, electrophysical, pharmacological, and biochemical evidence indicates that the benzodiazepines exert their therapeutic effects by interacting with a high-affinity binding site (receptor) in the brain. The benzodiazepine receptor interacts with a receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, and enhances its inhibitory effects. The benzodiazepine receptor may also interact with endogenous substances and several naturally occurring compounds, including the purines and nicotinamide, are candidates for this role. Both the purines and nicotinamide possess some benzodiazepine-like properties in vivo, although further work will be required to confirm their possible roles as endogenous benzodiazepines.", 
    "36": "Characteristic potentiation of rat locomotion responses and acoustic startle reflexes that normally appear in the third postnatal week was absent in rats exposed to diazepam during the third week of gestation. Loss of these behaviors suggests a long-term effect that may result from changes in cellular development. Tissue undergoing neuronal differentation may be especially sensitive to drugs that act on the central nervous system, and the period in which differentiation occurs is perhaps critical for the induction of changes that are later expressed as altered behavior.", 
    "37": "On the background of the wellknown favorable effects on the social behavior, mood and activation, a six-week treatment with Hydergin of 34 inhabitants of an old people's home led to a significant improvement in the results of psychometric performance tests and to a realistic self-appraisal with consequent greater adaptation. Hydergin was thus shown to be distinctly superior in its observed favorable therapeutic effects to chlordiazepoxide which sometimes rather intensifies the unrealistic self-appraisal of people living in old people's homes.", 
    "38": "Anaesthesia in disaster situations and in traumatology will be done with ketamine, propanidid and in some cases with a single shot methohexital. The intravenous injection of ketamine as well as propanidid is followed by a significant increasing of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Only barbiturate derivates cause a depression of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The results are demonstrated in experiments with dogs.", 
    "39": "1. Adenosine (10(-7) to 3 x 10(-4) M) or 2-chloroadenosine (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the responses of the rat isolated vas deferens to electrical field stimulation. In electrically driven (2 Hz) guinea-pig isolated left atria, adenosine (10(-6) to 10(-3) M) or 2-chloroadenosine (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) produced concentration-dependent decreases in isometric tension. 2. Diazepam (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) had no direct effect per se, but significantly potentiated the inhibitory action of adenosine on both tissues without altering the inhibitory effect of 2-chloroadenosine. 3. The adenosine uptake inhibitors, hydroxynitrobenzylthioguanosine (HNBTG, 10(-5) M) and dipyridamole (10(-5) M) also potentiated the inhibitory actions of adenosine in rat vas deferens, but not hose of 2-chloroadenosine. 4. Following adenosine uptake inhibition in rat vas deferens by HNBTG (10(-5) M), diazepam (10(-5) M) failed to produce any significant further potentiation of the inhibitory action of adenosine. 5. It is concluded that the potentiation of adenosine by diazepam is possibly due to an inhibition of adenosine uptake.", 
    "40": "Sniffing of heroin could be demonstrated in four acute deaths of drug addicts by radioimmunological analysis of the nasal mucosa. In addition, the influence of other drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates) or chronic diseases (hepatitis, cardiomyopathy), and acute alterations (pneumonia, myocarditis) were responsible for the fatal course. Different routes of application of drugs, especially heroin, are cited from literature and discussed.", 
    "41": "A psychotic episode is described in a 21 year old male suffering since the age of 14 of generalized convulsions and tipical absences, scarecely controlled by antiepileptic drugs. The psychotic episode took place after a \"Petit Mal Status\", and was characterized by behaviour disorders, psycomotor excitement and delusions. During the episode the EEG became normal and epileptic seizures were not observed. Treatment with neuroleptics was followed by reduction of psychic disturbances.", 
    "42": "Dynamic study of the acoustic reflex has brought into evidence that 1. age has a significant influence on various reflex response parameters 2. study of dynamic parameters of the acoustic reflex enables changes in the reflex arc to be objectified. This is therefore an objective measurement of recruitment in impedance measurement. The author proposes to study the following parameters: rise time, recovery time, and the variations of maximum amplitude as function of sound stimulation intensity. Study of these three parameters provides a highly sensitive test of change in the dynamics of the acoustic reflex, for indeed this test reveals pathology well before the Reflex Decay Test does so.", 
    "43": "A mild mental stress was applied on 39 normal people and on 33 patients with coronary artery disease. The test consisted in their selecting the proper switch out of 2, in order to switch off a lamp out of 3 as soon as possible after its ignition. The 3 lamps were lit by the examiner in a stereotyped random sequence. No consequences were implied against the subjects in case of failure and this was clearly explained to them. The response time of the people was recorded together with their electrocardiogram in a one-channel recorder using a suitable circuitry. The study showed that the response time became progressively shorter during the test only in the coronary group, although the mean value did not differ significantly from that in the normal group. The R-R interval was shortened in both groups but in the coronary group significantly more so than in the normal group. Pretreatment with diazepam reversed both responses of the coronary group. Pretreatment with propranolol mitigated the tachycardiac effect of the test in the coronary group, reversed its effect in the normal group and shortened the response time significantly in the normal group. The objective time measurements by the device used might suggest that in patients with coronary artery disease both the specific (response time) and the nonspecific (R-R interval) behaviour in response to a mental stress differ from that in normal people. This behaviour may be modified by medicaments like diazepam and propranolol.", 
    "44": "Increasing importance is being given to the residual effects of hypnotics on the day following absorption; with zopiclone, a new hypnotic, we have studied vigilance 9, 12 and 15 hours after a single evening dose of 10 mg, on a double-blind basis in comparison with 10 mg of nitrazepam and a placebo. The assessment of vigilance is based on responses to self-rating questionnaires and psychometric tests. Twenty-one healthy subjects forming a homogeneous group as regards age, I.Q., and vigilance were included in this study. Each subject received the three products in random distributed order, with an interval of three months between each trial. The results of these tests reveal modifications which, particularly 9 hours after administration, reflect a modification in vigilance, appearing to be more marked with nitrazepam than with zopiclone. Thus, from the point of view of the residual effects of hypnotics on vigilance, it is possible to position the products tested in the following order: placebo -- zopiclone -- nitrazepam.", 
    "45": "Penicillin application to the rat motor cortex and electrical stimulation of n. ventroposterolateralis thalami (VPL) at 1/s frequency and intensity 3 times exceeding a threshold for the primary evoked potential produced an alternation of \"active\" and \"passive\" periods--cyclic spike driving. During \"active\" periods epileptiform discharges appeared regularly at every electric stimulus. During \"passive\" periods electrical stimulation of VPL resulted in the emergence of evoked potentials only. Injection of diazepam (2 mg/kg) abolished rhythmogenesis in the epileptogenic focus, while 0.1 mg/kg diazepam led to disappearance of cyclic spike driving in the focus. Electrical stimulation of VPL at 2/s frequency restored cyclic spike driving.", 
    "46": "Although the basic rhythm of stepping, walking, and running is present in the spinal cord, it is not manifest in patients with lesions of the spinal cord, on account of spasticity. Spasticity is an over-reaction to every kind of input. Every response is followed by an after-discharge. This affects the muscles which have reacted, and it spreads to involve many other muscles, more ipsilaterally than contralaterally. In the normal this is prevented by the corticospinal tract, by Renshaw inhibition, and by inhibition of the input to the spinal cord. Anything that reduces the input that finally reaches motor neurons reduces general excitability; it reduces spasticity permanently, allowing normal movements to occur.", 
    "47": "Absence status is a form of generalized status epilepticus usually presenting as an acute confusional state. It is often initially mistaken for a psychiatric disorder, as was true in two of the six adult cases reviewed in this series. The differential diagnosis includes drug intoxication, post-ictal state, complex partial status epilepticus, transient global amnesia, organic brain syndrome, and interictal psychosis. Associated convulsive movements, such as eyelid flutter or rhythmic facial movements, if seen, should alert the clinician to consider absence status, and an electroencephalogram is needed to verify the diagnosis. Although usually occurring in known epileptics, in this small series 50% of patients did not have a history of a seizure disorder. Small fractional doses of intravenous diazepam is the treatment of choice for acute termination of the episode.", 
    "48": "The benzodiazepine Clonazepam, as well as electrolesions of the serotoninergic raphe nuclei, dorsalis and medianus, in rats have a learning-facilitating effect using the system of two-way avoidance. The animals with lesions manifest twice higher values of the index for avoidance learning compared with the control animals. In repeated training, the animals treated with Clonazepam in doses of 1 mg/kg for five successive days, show almost twice higher learning index compared with the controls, the index of Clonazepam-treated animals with lesions being four times higher than the controls. Clonazepam-treated animals manifest a higher number of conditioned-reflex avoidance responses compared with the controls throughout the entire 5-day period. Clonazepam-treated rats with raphe lesions reveal a significantly higher number of conditioned-reflex avoidance responses compared with the control group and with the group of Clonazepam-treated animals. Clonazepam-treated animals show a lower number of inadequate avoidance responses compared with the control animals, while in the Clonazepam-treated animals with lesions there are almost no inadequate reactions. The positive effects of Clonazepam and raphe lesions on avoidance training demonstrate the influence of the serotoninergic system on the processes of learning and memory.", 
    "49": "From 1974 to 1979, the rehabilitation centers of the association \"Le Patriarche\" located in the country side of southern France, have received 446 chronic polydrugs users who has consumed at one time or an other cannabis (marihuana, hashish) (87 p. cent), LSD (66 p. cent) and other hallucinogens (35 p. cent), psychodepressants (55 p. cent), psychostimulants (amphetamines, 85 p. cent; coca\u00efne, 50 p. cent) and opium and its derivatives (brown sugar, 47 p. cent; opiates, 67 p. cent; heroin, 50 p. cent). The dominant addictive drug was heroin and opiates, 52 p. cent, psychodepressants (barbitutiques and benzodiazepines, 33 p. cent, psychostimulants, 15 p. cent. Males were twice as numerous as female. Average age was 21 (range 14-38). Mean duration of drug abuse was 7 years. All these drug abusers display at entrance withdrawal symptoms. These were treated successfully by a drug free, psycho-physiological regimen comprising: 1. An elimination of all psychoactive drugs, including coffee, and alcohol. Tobacco was permitted. 2. Physical therapy (bath, exercise, massage) and forced fluid diuresis. 3. A supportive psychotherapy dispensed by rehabilitated addicts who had undergone successfully a similar regimen. This non-pharmacological method of treating withdrawal symptoms associated with opium, barbiturate and amphetamine addiction, was successful, and was not associated with any major clinical symptoms threatening the vital signs. Mean duration of detoxification was 5 days for opiates, 6 days for amphetamines and 10 days for barbiturates. 78 p. cent of these subjects remained in the centers from 3 months to 2 years, partaking in physical occupational and physiological rehabilitation paograms which allowed then to adopt a drug free life style and prepared them for social reinsertion.", 
    "50": "In order to test the possible differences in the clinical effects between benzodiazepines and barbiturates, 5 mg of diazepam and 60 mg of pentobarbital were used in a double-blind study as rectal premedication in 75 small children before major surgery. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the six parameters tested (demeanour in the anaesthetic room, preoperative emetic effect, response to venepuncture, degree of salivary suppression, postoperative state in the recovery room, postoperative emetic effect). The concentrations of pentobarbital and diazepam (and its 3 active metabolites) in the plasma were determined by gas chromatography and correlated with the clinical effects. No significant correlation was found between the total active benzodiazepine concentrations and the clinical effects of rectal diazepam. In contrast to diazepam, a weak but significantly positive correlation between the plasma concentrations of pentobarbital and the total score was found. Similarly, the plasma level of pentobarbital and the response to venepuncture and the degree of salivary secretion were in correlation with each other. In the plasma concentrations of both pentobarbital and total benzodiazepines, a wide interindividual variation was observed, indicating irregular rectal drug absorption.", 
    "51": "Anesthesia was induced with diazepam-ketamine-pancuronium in 12 adult patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. Intubation caused no significant changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, or plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Circulatory stability was an advantage in critically ill patients.", 
    "52": "Paroxystic-dyskinesias occurred in ten patients with encephalopathy and severe epilepsy associated with intellectual deficiences, during treatment of the epilepsy with diphenylhydantoin (DPH). The abnormal movements were usually paroxystic in nature and were mainly athetosic or choreic in nature affecting more particularly the facial region. None of the patients showed neurological signs during the attacks, which could have suggested an overdose of DPH, and the EEG showed no alterations. Blood levels of DPH were measured during the attacks in 9 of the patients and were within therapeutic limits in 6 cases. They were at toxic levels in the other 3 cases. All patients were receiving multiple therapy. The authors compare their findings with those in the published literature describing 46 such cases. Dyskinesias were usually observed in patients with encephalopaty. Of the 40 observations reported, blood levels of DPH were measured in 37 patients, and were found to be within normal therapeutic levels in 13 cases and at toxic levels in the other 24 patients. Clinical signs of an overdose were present in 26 cases. In all the cases reported by the authors, and in 28 cases described in published reports, the dyskinesias appeared when therapy was changed. Abnormal movements disappeared in 3 patients after an intravenous injection of diazepam. Experimental and biological arguments exist in favour of an action of DPH on the metabolism of cerebral mediators. The authors emphasize the need to investigate these dyskinetic manifestations which can be thought to be epileptic manifestations or signs of progressive encephalopathy.", 
    "53": "In an acute migraine clinic, patients were all treated with metoclopramide 10 mg i.m. and diazepam 5 mg p.o. In addition, 435 received acetylsalicylic acid 1,000 mg and 254 paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1,000 mg p.o. A computer analysis revealed the two groups of patients to be not statistically significantly different. In fact they were almost identical with respect to a large number of clinical parameters. The treatment results in the two groups were identical. The present study indicates that the two drugs are equipotent in the treatment of the acute migraine attack.", 
    "54": "The hemodynamics and the myocardial oxygen consumption during sleep and induction of anesthesia was studied in 10 patients with good left heart function (group I) and in 8 patients with bad left function (group II). Anesthesia was induced with diazepam (0.1 mg/kg BW), fentanyl (0.01 mg/kg BW), etomidate (0.2 mg/kg BW), and pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg BW). Four min after induction under ventilation with mask the cardiac index (CI) in both groups and the whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) diminished in exact the same degree. After intubation in patients of group I the CI and the VO2 decreased further, the arterio-venous oxygen content difference (avDO2) remained constant. In patients of group II the CI decreased to 0.9 1/min x m2, the avDO2 increased to 9.9 Vol%.", 
    "55": "A study was carried out in 80 mild to moderately depressed patients seen in general practice to assess the relative effectiveness and tolerance of a single night-time dose compared with the usual divided daily dosage regimen of a chlordiazepoxide (5 mg)/amitriptyline (12.5 mg) combination. Patients were assigned at random to receive either 1 capsule 3-times daily or 3 capsules as a single dose at night over a period of 3 weeks. Self-assessments of anxiety and depression using the Leeds scale were made at the initial visit and at weekly intervals, and an assessment of overall response to treatment was made by the doctor at the end of the trial period. Both groups showed significant improvement at each visit but the results suggest that the single night-time dose was more effective than the same dose given in a divided regimen. The good response obtained on relatively low doses of the tricyclic would support the view that chlordiazepoxide potentiates the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline.", 
    "56": "Excretion of phenazepam and its metabolites into the bile and their intrahepatic circulation were studied in experiments on rats, bile donors, who were preliminarily injected 14C-phenazepam (14 mg/kg) intravenously and on recipients who were administered the donor's bile intraduodenally. It was shown that phenazepam (compound I) and its 3-hydroxymetabolite (compound III) are excreted into the bile of the animals. Hydroxyl derivatives are excreted with the bile as glucuronides. Compounds I and III and glucuronide III undergo intrahepatic circulation.", 
    "57": "Changes in complement reactions are described in two patients exhibiting adverse reactions to Stesolid MR (diazepam with Cremophor as solvent). The recorded frequency of adverse reactions to Althesin, propandid and Stesolid MR suggests that the common solvent Cremophor is responsible for the adverse reactions."
