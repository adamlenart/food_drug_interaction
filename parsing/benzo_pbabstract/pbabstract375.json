    "0": "The effect of a series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the binding kinetics of dansylsarcosine (CAS 72517-44-3, DS), a marker ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site, and human serum albumin (HSA) was studied using the stopped-flow method. Both native (7% glycated) and 25% glycated HSA were used. The binding parameters were determined on the basis of the consecutive model. The DS association rate constant (k2) was 649 +/- 84 s-1 and 375 +/- 13 s-1 for 7% and 25% glycated HSA, respectively. These values were substantially influenced by addition of NSAIDs (molar ratio HSA:NSAID = 2:1), depending on the structure of NSAIDs. The calculated DS dissociation rate constant (k-2) was approximately 20 s-1. this value did not show marked dependence on the degree of glycation or on the presence of NSAIDs at the concentration used. The values were similar to estimates of kd (the displacement rate constant of DS) with the exception of diclofenac (CAS 15307-86-5) where kd was significantly lower, reaching 4.8 +/- 0.4 s-1 and 4.8 +/- 0.6 s-1 vs. k-2 parameters of 14 +/- 2.8 s-1 and 15 +/- 3.7 s-1 for 7% and 25% glycated HSA, respectively. A comparison of the enantiomers R- and S-ibuprofen (CAS 15687-27-1) and the regioisomers fenbufen (CAS 36330-85-5) and ketoprofen (CAS 22071-15-4) showed slight or no stereoslectivity of effects on the DS binding kinetics. However, the binding was influenced by bulk and nature of substituents at the aryl rest of propionic acid. The results obtained for mefenamic acid (CAS 61-68-7) suggest that this NSAID binds to a site of human serum albumin other than site II. Increased concentrations of glycoalbumin, as observed in diabetic patients, are not presumed to have inhibitory effects additional to that of NSAIDs which interact differentially with drugs at site II of HSA.", 
    "1": "The study was aimed at observing the changes in cooperation level of children undergoing dental procedures following the administration of a single oral dose of 7.5mg of Midazolam. Children were multinational, and ranged in age between 24 to 59 months. All subjects were considered to be resistant to routine behavioural management techniques. There was a 77.8% treatment visit success. The success rate was statistically insignificant between the sexes. Due to the small population, differences could not be elicited based on nationality and age group of subjects. There were however noticeable differences in behaviour based on the dental procedure being performed. Dental extraction had the poorest cooperation followed by cavity preparation. Cooperation improved significantly when the rubber dam was removed (where applied). Midazolam was found to increase treatment visit success rates in the present study.", 
    "2": "Sedative effects and drug elimination characteristics after intravenous bolus administration of diazepam 0.15 mg/kg were investigated in 15 patients with liver disease (Group I), and in 15 normal patients (Group II) during diagnostic laparoscopy. Diazepam induced heavier sedation in patients with liver disease (P < 0.02). Serum concentration of diazepam 30 minutes after administration was significantly lower in Group I (group with liver disease) when compared with Group II (control group) (210.68 +/- 112.65 ng/ml vs 451.57 +/- 239.87 ng/ml, p < 0.02). The sedation scores during the laparoscopy procedures correlate negatively with serum benzodiazepine levels. The benzodiazepine concentration-time profiles of the groups vary significantly (p < 0.02). Heavier sedative effect and lower benzodiazepine concentrations in patients with liver diseases suggests that the permeability of blood brain barrier increases and that higher affinity to benzodiazepine receptors exists. Differences in concentration-time courses of diazepam in patients with liver diseases is a warning indicating the accumulation of the drug when infused or used frequently.", 
    "3": "We determined the affinity and/or potency of two metabolites of clozapine (clozapine-N-oxide and N-desmethylclozapine) and of five atypical neuroleptics, chemically related (olanzapine) or unrelated to clozapine (remoxipride, risperidone, thioridazine, zotepine), at H3 receptors. The specific binding of 3H-N alpha-methylhistamine to rat brain cortex homogenates was inhibited by the seven compounds; the pKi values were: N-desmethylclozapine (5.33); clozapine-N-oxide (4.18); olanzapine (5.45); thioridazine (4.91); zotepine (4.75); remoxipride (4.51) and risperidone (4.43). Three compounds were examined in a functional H3 receptor model as well. The electrically evoked tritium overflow from superfused mouse brain cortex slices, which represents quasi-physiological noradrenaline release, was not affected by N-desmethylclozapine (3.2 and 10 microM), clozapine-N-oxide (3.2-100 microM) and olanzapine (3.2-32 microM). On the other hand, the three compounds shifted to the right the concentration-response curve of histamine for its inhibitory effect on the evoked overflow; the apparent pA2 values were 5.84, 4.21 and 5.80, respectively. The present study shows that five atypical neuroleptics of different chemical classes and the two major metabolites of clozapine possess a lower affinity and/or antagonistic potency at H3 receptors than clozapine itself (pKi 6.15, pA2 6.33; Kathmann M, Schlicker E, G\u00f6thert M (1994). Psychopharmacology 116: 464-468).", 
    "4": "Case material and retrospective studies support the use of both lorazepam and ECT in treating catatonia, but few prospective investigations exist and none employ quantitative monitoring of response. In this study we test their efficacy in an open, prospective protocol, and define a \"lorazepam test' with predictive value for treatment. Twenty-eight patients with catatonia were treated systematically with parenteral and/or oral lorazepam for up to 5 days, and with ECT if lorazepam failed. Outcome was monitored quantitatively during the treatment phase with the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS). In 16 of 21 patients (76%) who received a complete trial of lorazepam (11 with initial intravenous challenge), catatonic signs resolved. A positive response to an initial parenteral challenge predicted final lorazepam response, as did length of catatonic symptoms prior to treatment. Neither demographic variables nor severity of catatonia predicted response to lorazepam. Four patients failing lorazepam responded promptly to ECT. It is concluded that lorazepam and ECT are effective treatments for catatonia. The rating scale has predictive value and displays sensitivity to change in clinical status.", 
    "5": "For the treatment of acute mania, no single drug is sufficiently effective in daily clinical routine for all patients. Drug combinations are often prescribed but poorly investigated. The present study examined whether a treatment with a neuroleptic drug (zuclopenthixol) combined with a benzodiazepine (clonazepam) was superior to a treatment with lithium and the same benzodiazepine (lithium citrate and clonazepam). Twenty-eight hospitalized patients with a DSM-III-R manic episode were included, randomized to fixed drug doses and observed up to 28 days. Degree of mania, side effects and patients satisfaction with the treatment were registered. Approximately two thirds of the patients improved fully or partially on both drug combinations. Furthermore no statistically significant differences were found regarding acceptance and tolerance of the two drug combinations. The present drug combination are only two among several which deserve a thorough examination in order to prevent a random polypharmacy for treatment of mania.", 
    "6": "The objective of this study was to assess complications and risk factors among children undergoing conscious sedation (CS) with fentanyl (F) and midazolam (M) for reduction of fractures and dislocations. A 22-month retrospective review was made of an urban pediatric emergency department's records after implementing a CS protocol for the administration of F/M. Data collection was facilitated by standard CS forms, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi 2 analysis, Fisher's exact test, t test, odds ratio, and logistic regression. A total of 339 children (65% boys), mean age of 8.4 years, were enrolled in the study. The mean time to sedation was 11.3 +/- 6.2 minutes and to discharge was 92 +/- 36.3 minutes. The mean total doses of M and F were 0.17 +/- 0.08 mg/kg and 1.5 +/- 0.8 micrograms/kg, respectively. An alteration in respiratory status occurred in 37 (11.0%) patients: 28 (8.3%) had oxygen saturation < 90%; 16 (4.7%) received oxygen; 12 (3.6%) were given verbal breathing reminders, eight (2.4%) received airway positioning maneuvers, and 2 (0.6%) received naloxone. Four patients (1.2%) vomited. None required assisted ventilation, intubation, or admission resulting from complications of CS. Characteristics associated with the respiratory events included female sex (odds ratio = 2.2) and deep sedation (odds ratio = 2.7). We conclude that complications associated with F/M administered by protocol were few, minor, and easily managed. Patients who are female or who enter a state of deep sedation may be at modestly increased risk for alterations in respiratory status. Careful attention to monitoring vital functions on all patients is necessary to provide safe CS.", 
    "7": "The feasibility of a noninvasive method for quantification of [123I]iomazenil binding using a standardized arterial input function and a single venous blood sample was assessed in normal volunteers.", 
    "8": "Serial SPECT images and blood data from six healthy male volunteers after intravenous injection of [123I]iomazenil were used. The standardized input function was derived by averaging the six subjects' arterial curves. Individual input functions were estimated by calibrating the standardized input function with one-point venous blood radioactivity concentration. Ligand transport (K1) and receptor binding were computed from the estimated input functions and two separate SPECT scans using a table look-up procedure based on a three-compartment, two-parameter model. Reference values for K1 and receptor binding were determined from the serial SPECT data and individual arterial curves using a three-compartment, three-parameter model and curve fitting.", 
    "9": "Analyses of the error caused by the calibration in relation to the time postinjection revealed that the optimal calibration time was 30 min postinjection. Receptor binding obtained by this simplified method correlated well with the reference values (r = 0.941) and was estimated within an error of 10% in the cerebral cortical regions. Although the estimated K1 showed relatively poor correlation (r = 0.699) with the reference value, it was an excellent relative measure in each subject.", 
    "10": "Our method provided an absolute measure of the benzodiazepine receptor binding and a relative measure of ligand transport from two SPECT scans and a venous blood sample. This method would be useful for quantitative assessment of benzodiazepine receptors in clinical settings.", 
    "11": "The effects of an anxiolytic drug (diazepam) on emotional responses to aversive stimuli were investigated using physiological measures, including the startle probe reflex. Participants were 54 university students assigned to either a placebo group or a 10 mg or 15 mg diazepam group in a double-blind design. Blink responses to intermittent noise probes were recorded during viewing of neutral and unpleasant slides. Consistent with prior animal work, diazepam blocked startle potentiation during aversive stimulus processing without decreasing the overall magnitude of startle responses. These findings suggest that a common defensive state mediates startle reflex potentiation in animals and humans and that this index of fear can be used to assess the emotional effects of different drugs.", 
    "12": "Peptide YY (PYY), a 36-amino-acid polypeptide, is found in abundance in the colon, a region where its physiologic roles are unknown. Previous studies have revealed a substantial increase in plasma PYY after cholecystokinin (CCK) administration. PYY is released from the hindgut in response to a meal and inhibits CCK release. In this study we evaluated the effects of CCK and PYY on intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes. Colonic, ileal, or jejunal Thiry-Vella fistulas (TVFs) were created in 12 dogs, and intestinal continuity was reestablished. The TVFs were perfused with an isotonic buffer solution containing [14C] PEG as a volume marker. Electrolyte and water transport were measured every 15 minutes, and plasma PYY and CCK levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Group 1 dogs received an intravenous bolus of MK329, a specific CCK receptor antagonist, at 20 nmol/kg after a standard mixed meal; group 2 colonic TVF dogs received a meal and an intravenous bolus of PYY polyclonal antibody at 1 mg/kg. Postprandially, all three regions of the bowel became significantly proabsorptive for water, sodium, and chloride. In the colon postprandial absorption was abolished by MK329 starting 60 minutes after a meal, whereas specific CCK receptor blockade blunted ileal absorption. CCK receptor blockade did not affect postprandial absorption in the jejunum. Postprandial PYY levels did not rise in MK329-treated animals. PYY antibody reduced colonic absorption during the postprandial phase. Reduction of meal-induced colonic absorption and PYY release by MK329 in awake dogs suggests an important foregut-hindgut hormonal feedback loop. Foregut-derived CCK stimulates hindgut PYY release, which in turn stimulates colonic absorption while inhibiting further CCK release.", 
    "13": "Changes in gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor function and their relation to cross-tolerance to ethanol (EtOH) were studied in diazepam (DZP)-dependent rats. Physical dependence on DZP was induced in male Fischer rats by using the drug-admixed food method. The 38Cl- influx into cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes induced by 10 microM GABA in DZP-withdrawn rats was significantly increased, compared with control and DZP-tolerant rats. Although enhancement of GABA-dependent 38Cl- influx by the addition of EtOH and flunitrazepam (FZ) was recognized in the control, there was no such effect of EtOH or FZ in the DZP-tolerant animals. On the other hand, GABA-dependent 38Cl- influx was enhanced by FZ in the withdrawn group. The addition of picrotoxin and bicuculline inhibited GABA-dependent 38Cl- influx in each group. The stimulatory effect of FZ on GABA-dependent 38Cl- influx was inhibited by the addition of Ro 15-1788 in the control group. However, such an inhibitory effect was not observed in the withdrawn group. The antagonistic effect of Ro 15-4513 on EtOH stimulation of GABA-dependent 38Cl- influx observed in the control was not recognized in the withdrawn group. In a [3H]FZ assay of binding to benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, Bmax values were significantly increased in DZP-withdrawn animals, but decreased in the DZP-tolerant group, compared with the control. When [3H]muscimol binding was examined, the Kd of high-affinity sites of the GABAA receptor in withdrawn rats was significantly lower than in the control. In low-affinity binding sites, the values of Kd and Bmax were significantly decreased, compared with those in the control. The present study indicates that GABAergic transmission involving the regulation of GABA-dependent chloride channels is altered in DZP-dependent rats. Alterations of the GABAA/BZ/chloride channel complex function may be related to the cross-tolerance between BZ and EtOH.", 
    "14": "1. Development of anticonvulsant tolerance and benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor down-regulation has been reported to occur upon chronic administration of conventional BZDs. We compared the effect of chronic treatment with imidazenil, a new BZD partial agonist, and diazepam in rats. 2. After acute administration, imidazenil was more potent though less effective than diazepam in protecting from bicuculline-induced seizure. The time-course analysis of two peak equieffective doses of imidazenil (2.5 mumol kg-1 p.o.) and diazepam (35 mumol kg-1, p.o.) showed a longer lasting action of the former drug. 3. The anticonvulsant efficacy of diazepam (35 mumol kg-1, p.o.) was reduced in rats given chronic diazepam (35 mumol kg-1 p.o., 3 times a day for 8-15 days). No tolerance to imidazenil (2.5 mumol kg-1, p.o.) was apparent after 130-day administration with imidazenil (2.5 mumol kg-1, p.o., 3 times a day). 4. Plasma levels of imidazenil and diazepam, assessed 30 min after administration, were not changed in chronically treated animals. 5. In rats made tolerant to diazepam, the maximum number of [3H]-flumazenil binding sites were reduced in both cerebral cortex (-36%) and cerebellum (-42%). No changes in [3H]-flumazenil binding were found in chronic imidazenil-treated rats. 6. Specific [3H]-flumazenil binding in vivo was decreased in the forebrain of chronic diazepam- but not of chronic imidazenil-treated animals. 7. These data indicate that imidazenil possesses a very low tolerance potential to its anticonvulsant activity and does not affect BZD receptor density even after prolonged administration.", 
    "15": "We developed the increasing-current electroshock seizure (ICES) test, a new method for assessment of anti- and pro-convulsant activities of drugs in mice. In this method, a single train of pulses (square wave, 5 msec, 20 Hz) of linearly increasing intensity from 5 to 30 mA (increment of 0.1 mA/0.1 sec, i.e., 5-30 mA in 25 sec) was applied via ear electrodes. The current at which tonic hindlimb extension occurred was recorded as the seizure threshold. Thus, this method allows determination of the seizure threshold current for individual animals. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, diazepam, and morphine all increased the seizure threshold current in a dose-dependent manner, whereas ethosuximide was not effective. The seizure threshold current decreased after treatment with reserpine, chlorpromazine, aminophylline, strychnine, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, picrotoxin, and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE). These results indicate that the ICES test, like the maximal electroshock seizure test, is a model of grand mal-type seizure and is useful for evaluation of both the anti- and pro-convulsant activities of drugs.", 
    "16": "The capsule technique for small bowel biopsy performed at Swedish paediatric clinics was evaluated using two questionnaires in 1990 and 1993, respectively. Replies were received from all 45 centres which together perform approximately 2300 biopsies per year. Clotting function tests prior to biopsy were carried out in 42% of the centres. The biopsies were performed under intubation anaesthesia in 13% of the centres. The most striking difference between the answers to the two questionnaires was the mode of sedation. The use of intravenous sedatives increased from 40% of the centres in the first questionnaire to 59% in the second one. The use of the oral, rectal and intramuscular routes decreased correspondingly. The most frequently used drugs for intravenous sedation were benzodiazepines, in the first questionnaire diazepam and in the second one midazolam. The failure rate was approximately 5%. In the first questionnaire, no complication was encountered. In the second questionnaire, three cases of intramural duodenal haematoma were reported, one of which led to pancreatitis. We conclude that by focusing on questions of sedation these rather simple questionnaires may have resulted in more effective sedation of children undergoing small bowel biopsy.",

    "24": "Xenobiotics frequently induce proteins involved in their detoxification. Because many drugs that are metabolized by human cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5 are also transported by the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein, we determined whether expression of these proteins was altered by a variety of drugs in a cell line derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma, LS180/WT, and its adriamycin-resistant subline, LS180/AD50. P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 were constitutively expressed in both LS180/AD50 and LS180/WT cells, and both proteins were up-regulated after treatment with many drugs, including rifampicin, phenobarbital, clotrimazole, reserpine, and isosafrole. However, there were some exceptions because P-glycoprotein was up-regulated by midazolam and nifedipine, whereas CYP3A4 was not. CYP3A5, which is also constitutively expressed in these cells, remained unchanged with most drug treatments but was up-regulated by reserpine and clotrimazole. The apparent coordinated coexpression of the CYP3A gene family and P-glycoprotein in the LS180 cells suggests that for common orally administered drugs, P-glycoprotein may play an important role in net drug absorption and drug/drug interactions of shared CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein substrates.", 
    "25": "A cDNA encoding the human gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor alpha 6 subunit has been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA shows 91.4% identity with the published rat alpha 6 subunit. In situ hybridization histochemistry reveals the alpha 6 mRNA to be located within the granule cell layer of the human cerebellar cortex. Recombinant human alpha 6 beta gamma 2S GABAA receptors have been expressed in both stably transfected cells and Xenopus oocytes, and the pharmacology of the benzodiazepine binding site has been determined. The recombinant receptor has a diazepam-insensitive pharmacology, with negligible affinity for a number of classic benzodiazepines. A number of compounds that bind to the benzodiazepine site potentiated the GABA response of alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors. Most importantly, the classic benzodiazepine antagonist ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788) and the partial inverse agonist ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-4513) both acted as agonists at the alpha 6 containing receptor. This observation demonstrates definitively that efficacy of benzodiazepine compounds cannot be generalized across receptor subtypes and may also help explain some of the behavioral effects that have been reported for these compounds.", 
    "26": "Exposure to 12 atmospheres absolute (12 ATA) helium oxygen gas (heliox) (low level hyperbaric exposure) antagonizes the behavioral effects of ethanol and n-propanol, but not morphine. These and other results indicate that the mechanism of the antagonism is direct (pharmacodynamic) and selective. Our study further investigates the selectivity of low level hyperbaric antagonism by testing its effectiveness against diazepam, a high affinity binding drug that acts via allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors. C57BL/6J mice received injections i.p. of vehicle or diazepam, and were then exposed to 1 ATA air, 1 ATA heliox or 12 ATA heliox. Exposure to 12 ATA heliox antagonized the locomotor depressant effect of 4 and 6 mg/kg, but not 8 mg/kg diazepam. Hyperbaric exposure also antagonized the anticonvulsant effect of 8 and 24 mg/kg, but not 4 mg/kg, diazepam vs. 300 mg/kg isoniazid. Exposure to 12 ATA heliox did not significantly affect blood concentrations of diazepam or its metabolite n-desmethyl diazepam. The pharmacological characteristics of the antagonism (direct, surmountable, rightward shift in diazepam's dose-response curve) closely matched those seen in previous studies for hyperbaric antagonism of ethanol. The results add to the evidence that low level hyperbaric exposure is a direct, mechanistic antagonist that selectively antagonizes drugs that act via perturbation or allosteric modulation of receptor function. Moreover, the results suggest that allosteric coupling pathways, which transduce binding events on ligand-gated ion channels, may represent initial sites of action for ethanol.", 
    "27": "The formation kinetics of 2-hydroxymethyl olanzapine (2-OH olanzapine), 4'-N-oxide olanzapine (N-O olanzapine) and 4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine (NdM olanzapine) were analyzed in vitro. Biphasic kinetics were observed for formation of 2-OH and NdM olanzapine. The high-affinity enzyme responsible for 2-OH olanzapine formation by two human liver samples exhibited an intrinsic clearance (CLint) of 0.2 microliter/min/mg. NdM olanzapine formation by two human liver samples exhibited a CLint of 1.0 microliter/min/mg for the high affinity enzyme. The formation of N-O olanzapine was linear up to 300 microM olanzapine, yielding a CLint of 0.32 to 1.70 microliters/min/mg. The formation of 7-hydroxy olanzapine (7-OH olanzapine) exhibited an apparent Km of 24.2 microM. The rates of 2-OH olanzapine formation correlated with CYP2D6 levels and activity, and it was formed to the greatest extent by cDNA-expressed CYP2D6. N-O olanzapine formation correlated with human liver flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO3) levels and activity. NdM olanzapine and 7-OH olanzapine formation correlated with CYP1A2 catalytic activities and they were formed to the greatest extent by expressed CYP1A2. These results suggest that CYP1A2 catalyzes NdM olanzapine and 7-OH olanzapine formation, CYP2D6 catalyzes 2-OH olanzapine formation and FMO3 catalyzes N-O olanzapine formation.", 
    "28": "Biotransformation of the triazolobenzodiazepine triazolam to its hydroxylated metabolites, alpha-hydroxy (OH)- and 4-OH-triazolam, was studied in vitro using microsomal preparations of human liver. Mean values of Vmax (10.3 nM/min/mg of protein) and Km (304 microM) for the 4-OH pathway exceeded values for the alpha-OH pathway (2.4 and 74, respectively). However the mean Vmax/Km ratios for the two pathways were nearly identical, indicating that both contribute approximately equally to intrinsic clearance. Ketoconazole was a powerful inhibitor of triazolam biotransformation, having mean competitive Ki values of 0.006 and 0.023 microM for the alpha-OH and 4-OH pathways. This is consistent with the role of P450-3A isoforms in mediating triazolam biotransformation. The serotonin2 antagonist antidepressant nefazodone inhibited the alpha-OH and 4-OH pathways (Ki = 0.6 and 1.7 microM, respectively), but with considerably less activity than ketoconazole. Among six selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitor antidepressants, norfluoxetine was the most potent inhibitor (Ki = 2.7 and 8.0 microM) and fluoxetine itself was the weakest (Ki = 7.0 and 44.3 microM). In a double-blind clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, administration of triazolam (0.125 mg) preceded by ketoconazole, compared to triazolam preceded by placebo, produced a nearly 9-fold reduction in apparent oral clearance of triazolam (41 vs. 337 ml/min) and a 4-fold prolongation of half-life (13.5 vs. 3.4 hr). Pharmacodynamic testing indicated enhancement of electroencephalographic beta activity, and enhanced decrements in digit-symbol substitution test performance, attributable to coadministration of ketoconazole. Plasma ketoconazole concentrations measured in the clinical study ranged from 0.02 microgram/ml (projected minimum) to 4.95 micrograms/ml (maximum). An in vitro-in vivo scaling model, using these plasma ketoconazole concentrations together with liver partition ratios and the in vitro Ki values, predicted a decrement of triazolam clearance due to ketoconazole coadministration that was consistent with the 88% decrement in clearance actually observed in vivo.", 
    "29": "For patients with a confirmed diagnosis of dementia, your challenge is to promote a quality life during their remaining years. This task often includes managing problem behaviors. A systematic approach starts with pinpointing the nature of the specific behavior, reviewing possible physical and emotional stressors, and checking for coexisting affective or psychotic disorders. It often helps to reduce environmental stimulation and to simplify the patient's tasks. Drug therapy with an antipsychotic or benzodiazepine is indicated if a clear-cut behavioral strategy has not proven fully effective, the behavior has been well documented, and the behavior presents a clear danger to the patient or others or prevents necessary care from occurring.", 
    "30": "The effects of baclofen, a gamma-amino-n-butyric acid receptor B agonist, on gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and how its effects are influenced by selective (M1) and non-selective (M1 and M2) pharmacological blockade of muscarinic receptors were investigated in inbred Wistar rats. Rats were given s.c. injections of 8 mg/kg body wt baclofen with and without 0.5 mg/kg body wt atropine (non-selective M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist) or 1.0 mg/kg body wt pirenzepine (selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist) every other day after a 25 week carcinogen treatment. At week 52 baclofen significantly decreased the incidence of gastric cancers. Concomitant treatment with atropine significantly attenuated the inhibition by baclofen of gastric carcinogenesis, but combined use with pirenzepine had no significant effect on the inhibition by baclofen of gastric carcinogenesis. Baclofen also significantly decreased the labeling index of the antral mucosa. Baclofen plus atropine attenuated the decrease in the labeling index of the antral mucosa due to baclofen, but baclofen plus pirenzepine had no significant effect on the labeling index. These results suggest that the inhibition of gastric carcinogenesis by baclofen is mediated through muscarinic receptors and M2 receptors, but not M1 receptors, are involved in this response.", 
    "31": "The authors examined the effect of diazepam and flumazenil on prolactin and LH secretion in women. The experiment lasted 12 hours during which specimens of venous blood were collected for assessment of LH and prolactin after 10-minute intervals. After 5 hours to a group of 8 women (4 in the luteal and 4 in the follicular stage of the cycle) flumazenil was administered--3 x 10 mg i.v. after 30 minute intervals, and to a group of 7 women (3 in the follicular and 4 in the luteal stage of the cycle) diazepam was administered--10 mg i.v. after 30-minute intervals. Flumazenil administration did not affect the LH or prolactin secretion. Diazepam caused in 3 of 4 women in the luteal phase of the cycle a significant rise of the prolactin secretion (p < 0.001), in the remaining women in the luteal phase and 3 women in the follicular stage a rise of prolactin was recorded but it did not reach statistical significance. The LH level was significantly influenced (i.e. decreased) in one of 7 women.", 
    "32": "The authors encountered 22 patients in whom a skin biopsy showed atypical lymphoid hyperplasia and in whom a subsequent drug history showed indigestion of one or more agents before lesional onset. In 13 patients, the biopsy had been performed to rule out a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, whereas the other nine the clinical impression was that of a drug eruption. Among the more frequently prescribed agents were calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antidepressants, antihistamines, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines and lipid-lowering agents, all of which are either known to perturb lymphocyte function or have been implicated as a cause of pseudolymphomata. Twelve of the patients were on two or more of these drugs. The effect of drug modulation on the clinical course was assessed. The clinical presentations were as one or more erythematous plaques or multiple infiltrative papules, or as solitary nodules. The patient had been on one or more of the aforementioned drugs from 2 weeks to 5 years before developing the lesions. Resolution of the eruptions occurred in 17 patients within 1 to 32 weeks (mean, 7 weeks) of discontinuing the medication. Five additional patients had complete excision of solitary lesions without recurrence. A history of atopy, autoimmune disease, or previous carcinoma was elicited in five patients. All biopsy specimens showed atypical lymphoid infiltrates, which assumed one or more of the following patterns: mycosis fungoides (MF)-like, a lymphomatoid vascular reaction, lymphocytoma cutis and follicular mucinosis. Based on the histopathology of the biopsied lesions and the clinical course being one of lesional resolution after cessation of drug therapy or excision of a solitary lesion without subsequent recurrence, a diagnosis of drug-associated lymphomatoid hypersensitivity was established in all specimens. A diagnosis of drug-associated pseudolymphoma should be excluded before a diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma is rendered, and should be considered if the patient is on a drug known to alter lymphocyte function, particularly in the setting of systemic immune dysregulation or multidrug therapy where agent may act synergistically or cumulatively to alter lymphoid function. The authors postulate that the drug may promote an aberrant immune response to an antigen that may be the drug itself or some other stimulus. A skin biopsy may be particularly helpful, as the lesions of drug-associated pseudolymphoma have a morphology distinctive from malignant lymphoma.",

    "34": "We report longitudinal data on a group of 29 male patients 50 years of age or older who were initially diagnosed as having idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) after extensive polysomnographic and neurologic evaluations. Thirty-eight percent (11/29) were eventually diagnosed as having a parkinsonian disorder (presumably Parkinson's disease) at a mean interval of 3.7 +/- 1.4 (SD) years after the diagnosis of RBD+, and at a mean interval of 12.7 +/- 7.3 years after the onset of RBD. To date, only 7% (2/29) of patients have developed any other neurologic disorder. At the time of RBD diagnosis, data from the RBD group with eventual Parkinson's disease (n = 11) and the current idiopathic RBD group (n = 16) were indistinguishable, with two exceptions: the RBD-Parkinson's disease group had a significantly elevated hourly index of periodic limb movements of non-REM sleep and an elevated REM sleep percentage. RBD was fully or substantially controlled with nightly clonazepam treatment in 89% (24/27) of patients in both groups. Thus, RBD can be the heralding manifestation of Parkinson's disease in a substantial subgroup of older male RBD patients. However, a number of presumed Parkinson's disease patients may eventually be diagnosed with multiple system atrophy (striatonigral degeneration subtype). Our findings indicate the importance of serial neurologic evaluations after RBD is diagnosed and implicate the pedunculopontine nucleus as a likely site of pathology in combined RBD-Parkinson's disease, based on experimental and theoretical considerations rather than on autopsy data.",

Receptor immunoprecipitation with the subunit-specific antibodies shows that 39% of the cerebellar GABAA receptors have alpha 6, whereas 76% of the receptors have alpha 1 as determined by [3H]-muscimol binding. Results show that 42-45% of the receptors having alpha 6 also have alpha 1, whereas 13-15% of the receptors that contain alpha 1 also have alpha 6. The immunoprecipitation results as well as immunopurification and immunoblotting experiments reveal the existence of three types of cerebellar GABAA receptors; i.e., one has both alpha 1 and alpha 6 subunits, a second type has alpha 1 but not alpha 6, and a third type has alpha 6 but not alpha 1 subunits. The results also show that receptors where alpha 1 and alpha 6 subunits coexist have two pharmacologically different benzodiazepine-binding properties, each associated with a different alpha subunit. The alpha 1 subunit contributes the high-affinity binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) and the diazepam-sensitive binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513. The alpha 6 subunit contributes the diazepam-insensitive binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513, but it does not bind [3H]Ro 15-1788 with high affinity. Thus, in the cerebellar alpha 1- alpha 6 GABAA receptors, there is no dominance of the pharmacology of one alpha subunit over the other.",

Newly learned tectal auditory responses, induced by altered visual experience, were found to be pharmacologically distinct from normal responses expressed at the same tectal sites. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists administered systemically or applied locally in the ICX reduced learned responses more than normal responses. This differential blockade was not observed with non-NMDA or broad-spectrum antagonists. Thus, NMDA receptors preferentially mediate the expression of novel neuronal responses induced by experience during development.", 
    "69": "Prolonged administration of anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant drugs that act through the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) can evoke tolerance and dependence, suggesting the existence of an endogenous mechanism(s) for altering the ability of such agents to interact with the GABAAR. Uncoupling appears to be one such mechanism. This is a decrease in the allosteric interactions between the benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site and other agonist or modulator sites on the GABAAR, as measured by potentiation of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) binding. To investigate the mechanism(s) of uncoupling, neuronal cultures were treated chronically with 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one (pregnanolone), pentobarbital, flurazepam, or GABA, then tested for enhancement of [3H]FNZ binding by these substances. The results indicate that BZDs, barbiturates, and steroids, as well as GABA itself, are capable of inducing both heterologous and homologous uncoupling. Surprisingly, different chronic drug treatments produce different patterns of homologous and heterologous uncoupling. Chronic exposure to pregnanolone, GABA, flurazepam or pentobarbital induces complete uncoupling of barbiturate-BZD site interactions, partial uncoupling of GABA-BZD site interactions, but different amounts of uncoupling of steroid-BZD site interactions. In addition, the EC50 for pregnanolone-induced homologous uncoupling (1.7 microM) is over an order of magnitude greater than that for heterologous uncoupling of GABA and BZD sites (82 nM). Moreover, heterologous uncoupling by pregnanolone is inhibited by the GABA site antagonist SR-95531, whereas homologous uncoupling by pregnanolone is resistant to SR-95531. Therefore, there are at least two distinct ways in which GABAAR modulatory site interactions can be regulated by chronic drug treatment.",

    "71": "Directed screening of compounds selected from the Glaxo registry file for contractile activity on the isolated guinea pig gallbladder (GPGB) identified a series of 1,5-benzodiazepines with peripheral cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor agonist activity. Agonist efficacy within this series was modulated by variation of substituents on the N1-anilinoacetamide moiety. Remarkably, a single methyl group confers agonist activity, with an N-isopropyl substituent providing optimal efficacy. Hydrophilic substituents on the anilino nitrogen abolish agonist activity or produce antagonists of CCK. In contrast, hydrophilic electron-donating groups at the para-position of the anilino ring enhance or maintain in vitro and in vivo agonist activity. Despite decreased affinity for the human CCK-A receptor, relative to CCK-8, some of these compounds are equipotent to CCK as anorectic agents in rats following intraperitoneal administration.", 
    "72": "A great interest is devoted to antagonists of the cholecystokinin type B (CCKB) receptor such as L-365,260, which reduces panic attacks in humans and to antagonists of the cholecystokinin type A (CCKA) receptor, such as L-364,718 which might be efficient in mental diseases. The A/B specificity of these antagonists was proposed to be mainly dependent on the amino acid sequence of the seventh transmembrane domain (Mantamadiotis and Baldwin (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 201,1382). In our study, one of these residues, His381 was replaced in the rat CCKB receptor by leucine (the corresponding residue in the CCKA receptor), phenylalanine or arginine using site-directed mutagenesis. Changing histidine for leucine or phenylalanine did not modify significantly the affinity of the CCKB receptor antagonists, L-365,260 and PD-134,308 although both compounds belong to different chemical classes, but strongly improved the affinity of the CCKA receptor antagonists tested. Interestingly, the A selectivity of these CCKA receptor antagonists was recovered by substituting His381 by arginine. Moreover, these results are discussed on the basis of a three dimentional model of the CCKB receptor. The mutated receptors possessed unchanged binding properties for agonists, suggesting that determinants confering specificity for agonists and antagonists are different.",

Neither chronic ethanol treatment nor withdrawal significantly altered total [3H]RO15-4513 binding in mouse cortex or cerebellum. However, diazepam-insensitive [3H]RO15-4513 binding density (Bmax) in cerebellum was significantly increased immediately following chronic ethanol treatment (60%) and at 8 h following withdrawal (75%). [3H]RO15-4513 binding affinity was not significantly influenced by chronic ethanol exposure or withdrawal. These results indicate that chronic ethanol treatment and withdrawal can selectively up-regulate diazepam-insensitive [3H]RO15-4513 binding sites and suggest that this unique GABAA receptor subtype may play some role in ethanol dependence and withdrawal.", 
    "74": "Elevation of blood pressure is a characteristic feature of spontaneous and pharmacologically induced panic attacks in man. We examined whether this symptom could be reproduced in conscious rats and, if so, whether the cardiovascular changes induced by anxiogenic agents could be employed as a functional in vivo screen for CCK-B receptor antagonists which might be predictive of anxiolytic activity. Bolus i.v. administration of pentagastrin (0.1-100 micrograms/kg) or the beta-carboline FG-7142 (0.001-3 mg/kg) caused transient ( < or = 5 min) dose-dependent increases in arterial blood pressure of up to 41 mmHg. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.v, 15 min previously) attenuated the pressor response induced by either pentagastrin (1 microgram/kg i.v.) or FG-7142 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.). In contrast, the CCK-B receptor antagonist CI-988 (3 mg/kg i.v., 15 min previously) inhibited the pressor response induced by pentagastrin, but not FG-7142. Antagonism of the pressor response elicited by pentagastrin in animals provides a simple method to establish the active dose range for CCK-B receptor antagonists in vivo. Since cardiovascular parameters can be readily monitored in man, this approach may assist in guiding clinical dose ranging studies to establish therapeutically beneficial effect of these compounds in panic disorder.", 
    "75": "Involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors in state-dependent learning (SDL) induced by ethanol (EtOH) was investigated in the step-through passive avoidance task in rats. Pre-training injections of EtOH or MK-801 reduced step-through latency in the test session conducted 24 h after the training session. Pre-test as well as pre-training injections of EtOH failed to reduce the latency, while pre-training and pre-test injections of MK-801 reduced the latency. These results show that EtOH but not MK-801 produces SDL. SDL induced by EtOH was blocked by ICS205-930 injected before either the training or test session. However, ICS205-930 failed to block SDL induced by diazepam and muscimol. These results suggest that NMDA receptor complex may not be involved in SDL, and that 5-HT3 receptors may contribute to SDL induced by EtOH but not by diazepam and muscimol.",

    "81": "Choice of anesthetic induction protocol has little impact on hemodynamic function during surgery in halothane-anesthetized horses. Surgical stimulation may increase blood pressure, but does not improve cardiac index or oxygen delivery.", 
    "82": "Noxious as well as hypertonic stimuli potentiate vasopressin and oxytocin secretion in rats. Neurohypophysial vasopressin- and oxytocin-secreting neurons receive inhibitory synaptic inputs mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Benzodiazepines modulate GABA-A receptor activity in a facilitatory fashion. It is thus possible that benzodiazepines suppress vasopressin and oxytocin release after noxious stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether chlordiazepoxide impairs the enhanced release of vasopressin and oxytocin after noxious or hypertonic stimuli in male rats. Chlordiazepoxide (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked dose-dependently the vasopressin and oxytocin responses to footshocks. Chlordiazepoxide, however, did not impair the hormonal responses to hypertonic stimulus. The results demonstrate that chlordiazepoxide selectively prevents vasopressin and oxytocin release after noxious stimuli and therefore suggest that the sites of chlordiazepoxide actions are not on the vasopressin or oxytocin neurons in rats.", 
    "83": "The extent of drug use among drivers suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs in Finland was studied. All blood samples submitted to the laboratory during 1 week in two study periods, in 1979 (n = 298) and 1993 (n = 332), were analyzed for alcohol and psychotropic drugs. Drugs classified as hazardous to traffic safety were detected in 7.0% of the samples in 1979 and 26.8% in 1993. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently found drugs in both years: 6.0% of the cases in 1979 and 22.9% in 1993. Illegal drugs were found in 4% of the cases in 1993. Of the samples tested, 296 in 1979 and 317 in 1993 were from drivers suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol only. In 1979 every fourteenth and in 1993 every fourth of these suspected drunken drivers had drugs in their blood. Drugs, other than alcohol, were found six times more often than expected by the police. The results indicate that the trend of drug use, multidrug use and drug abuse is increasing among cases suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs.", 
    "84": "The study includes medicolegally examined deaths among drug addicts in 1991 in the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. A common definition of 'drug addict' was applied by the participating countries. The greatest number of drug addict deaths per 10(5) inhabitants was observed in Denmark followed, in descending order by Norway, Sweden, Finland and finally Iceland with only four deaths. The main difference between the countries was found in the number of fatal poisonings. The distribution according to geographical regions showed that about half of all drug addict deaths occurred in the metropolitan areas. Of the capitals, the greatest number of fatal poisonings per 10(5) inhabitants was seen in Oslo, followed by Copenhagen with a similar number, Stockholm with only the half, and Helsinki with a quarter. Heroin/morphine dominated as cause of death in fatal poisonings in Norway and Sweden. In Denmark, heroin/morphine caused about half of the fatal poisonings only, and nearly one third of the fatal poisonings was caused by methadone. Except for two cases in Sweden, methadone deaths were not seen in the other Nordic countries. Amphetamine caused one tenth of the fatal poisonings in Sweden. In Finland only one tenth of the deaths were caused by heroin/morphine and more by codeine, ethylmorphine and different drugs and poisons not classified in Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 or the International Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971. A widespread use of alcohol, cannabis and benzodiazepines, diazepam especially, was seen in all the countries.", 
    "85": "The effects of continuous administration of pentobarbital on the benzodiazepine receptor labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam were investigated. Animals were made tolerant to pentobarbital by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with pentobarbital (300 micrograms/10 microliters/h) for 6 days through pre-implanted canulae connected to osmotic mini-pumps. The dependent rats were assessed 24 h after cessation of pentobarbital infusion. Changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding were examined in 37 brain regions at a concentration of [3H]flunitrazepam of 1 nM. In subsequent saturation studies, the binding parameters Bmax and KD were also investigated in 17 brain regions, most of which showed significant changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding in experiments using a fixed concentration of radioligand. The pentobarbital-tolerant rats showed a significant increase in Bmax with an increase in KD for [3H]flunitrazepam in the ventroposterior nucleus of thalamus. In the dependent rats, a significant increase in Bmax for [3H]flunitrazepam binding, without a change in KD, was observed in all layers of the frontal cortex, the caudate-putamen, olfactory tubercle, and some nuclei in thalamus, compared to those in the control. Increased [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the molecular layer of the olfactory bulb, the ventral pallidum, and the cerebellum of the pentobarbital dependent rats at a fixed concentration of [3H]flunitrazepam was also observed. There was no significant change in [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the hippocampus and several nuclei of the brain stem. These findings suggest that benzodiazepine receptors are closely involved in the development of tolerance to and dependence on pentobarbital. Further studies on changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor subunit mRNA or the effects of pentobarbital on GABAA receptor phosphorylation would be necessary for an explanation of the precise mechanisms underlying the development of tolerance to and dependence on pentobarbital.", 
    "86": "High doses of morphine produce a state of behavioural inactivity and muscular rigidity. This type of 'catalepsy' is clearly different from the state which is produced by the administration of neuroleptics, e.g. haloperidol. While haloperidol-induced catalepsy can easily be antagonised by NMDA receptor antagonists, there has been a report that the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801) potentiates morphine-induced catalepsy. The aim of this study was to further examine the role of glutamate receptors in the mediation of morphine-induced catalepsy. To this end we coadministered morphine (20, 40, 60 mg/kg i.p.) with MK-801 (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.p.), the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentoic acid (CGP 37849) (2 and 6 mg/kg i.p.), or 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylen-dioxy-5H-2,3- benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) (2 and 4 mg/kg), an antagonist of the AMPA type of glutamate receptors, respectively. The degree of catalepsy was assessed using two different methods, the 'bar/podium/grid' test which is commonly used to measure neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, and a test for the presence or absence of righting reflexes after turning the animals into a supine position. It was found that in the 'bar/podium/grid' test coadministration of both NMDA receptor antagonists significantly and dose-dependently augmented morphine-induced catalepsy. The results using the AMPA receptor antagonist were less clear since the lower dose of GYKI 52466 tended to attenuate the morphine effect whereas the higher dose augmented morphine-induced catalepsy in some cases. While placing the animals on the bar and on the podium produced essentially the same results, the grid was found to be inapplicable for the measurement of morphine-induced catalepsy since the animals did not cling to the grid and fell off almost immediately after being released from the experimenter's hand. With respect to the righting reflexes it was found that the number of animals not showing these responses increased when MK-801 or CGP 37849 was coadministered with morphine. In contrast, most of the animals treated with GYKI 52466 and morphine displayed intact righting reflexes. It is concluded that glutamatergic transmission plays an important role in the mediation of morphine-induced catalepsy, though different to that of haloperidol-induced catalepsy, and that NMDA and AMPA receptors are differentially involved in different aspects of the associated behavioural state.", 
    "87": "We have previously shown that developmental hypoxic-ischemic injury in a unilateral rodent model leads to an increase in both morphologic and biochemical indices of striatal cholinergic neurons. To investigate the functional significance these changes, we have used the in vivo microdialysis technique to examine the regulation of striatal acetylcholine release in awake, adult rats following postnatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. We have found that injury does not alter basal release or acetylcholine, but it results in a marked augmentation in the increase of acetylcholine release normally observed after infusion of atropine or pirenzepine.", 
    "88": "The role of muscarinic receptors in sympathetic ganglionic impulse transmission has not been clearly recognized in whole animal studies. However, in certain situations, the muscarinic receptors may participate in modulating blood pressure, and there is thus some evidence for their role in ganglionic transmission. Pirenzepine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, elicited no significant changes in renal nerve activity (RNA) and blood pressure (BP) in normal rabbits; however, chlorisondamine, a ganglionic nicotinic receptor antagonist, caused marked decreases in RNA and BP in normal rabbits, reaching the nadir in 2 to 3 min and gradually recovering thereafter. In the presence of chlorisondamine, pirenzepine decreased both RNA and BP, but the recovery of chlorisondamine-induced decreases of both RNA and BP was attenuated by pirenzepine. McN-A-343, a muscarinic receptor agonist, caused a transient hypotensive effect. In the presence of chlorisondamine, McN-A-343 increased both RNA and BP in dose-related fashion, and the dose-response curves of McN-A-343 shifted to the right in the presence of pirenzepine. These results suggest that in sympathetic ganglia blockade of ganglionic nicotinic receptors activates muscarinic receptors which participate in regulation of peripheral sympathetic nerve activity and of blood pressure.", 
    "89": "A series of imidazo[1,5-a]quinoxaline amides, carbamates, and ureas which have high affinity for the gamma-aminobutyric acid A/benzodiazepine receptor complex was developed. Compounds within this class have varying efficacies ranging from antagonists to full agonists. However, most analogs were found to be partial agonists as indicated by [35S]TBPS and Cl- current ratios. Many of these compounds were also effective in antagonizing metrazole-induced seizures in accordance with anticonvulsant and possible anxiolytic activity. Selected quinoxalines displayed limited benzodiazepine-type side effects such as ethanol potentiation and physical dependence in animal models. Dimethylamino urea 41 emerged as the most interesting analog, having a partial agonist profile in vitro while possessing useful activity in animal models of anxiety such as the Vogel and Geller assays. In accordance with its partial agonist profile, 41 was devoid of typical benzodiazepine side effects.", 
    "90": "The central benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by zolpidem in man is unknown. The present study used positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]flumazenil to assess in five healthy volunteers, central benzodiazepine receptor occupancy in brain regions with high receptor densities 1 h following an acute oral administration of twice the usual hypnotic dose of zolpidem (20 mg). Receptor occupancy was measured in five discrete structures (middle frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, posterior occipital cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and cerebellar cortex) and in a large neocortical area as the fractional change in the [11C]flumazenil bound/free ratio for the interval 15-40 min post-administration of the radiotracer. The free-radioligand concentration was estimated from the pons, a reference structure virtually devoid of central benzodiazepine receptor. With individual pons values, mean occupancy was about 21% but with spurious inter-subject variability. With pons values averaged across the five subjects and separately for control and treated condition, the occupancy was (mean +/- S.D.) 27 +/- 11% for the whole neocortex, and ranged from 26 to 29% in the five discrete structures (P < 0.01). By showing hypnotic effect at moderate occupancies, this study directly provides evidence for the full-agonist properties of zolpidem in human.", 
    "91": "Most reported actions of kainate are mediated by AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) receptors. Here we report that, unlike AMPA which stimulates, kainate elicits a dose-dependent decrease in L-glutamate release from rat hippocampal synaptosomes and also depresses glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Brief exposure to kainate inhibited Ca(2+)-dependent [3H]L-glutamate release by up to 80%. Inhibition was reversed by kainate antagonists but not by the AMPA-selective non-competitive antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466). A corresponding reversible kainate-evoked depression of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (e.p.s.cs) was observed when AMPA receptors were blocked by GYKI 52466. The synaptic depression was preceded by a brief period of enhanced release and a small inward current was also observed. The effects of kainate were unaffected by metabotropic glutamate (mGlu), GABAA, GABAB, glycine and adenosine receptor antagonists. These results indicate that glutamate release can be modulated directly by kainate autoreceptors.", 
    "92": "Benzodiazepine receptor agonists and inverse agonists exert generally opposite actions at both the cellular and behavioural levels. The present study, however, reveals that both the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide and the partial inverse agonist, FG7142, yield a dose-dependent (2-16 mg/kg, i.p) reduction in the amplitude of the acoustic startle response in the rat. The similarity in drug effects on startle was not attributable to congruent effects on basal somatic activity, as chlordiazepoxide resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in activity whereas FG7142 was associated with a small but non-significant increase in activity. As these results contrast with the bidirectional actions of benzodiazepine receptor agonists and inverse agonists in behavioural tests of fear or anxiety, the neuronal mechanisms mediating the effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands on the acoustic startle response may be distinct from those that underlie the specific fear- attenuating and potentiating actions, respectively, of benzodiazepine receptor agonists and inverse agonists.", 
    "93": "2-(2-Benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline, RX801077 (2-BFI) which has high affinity for imidazoline I(2) binding sites and very low aflinity for \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptors, has been investigated for its ability to produce a discriminative stimulus (cue) in drug-discrimination studies in rats since the existence of such a cue could assist in determining the functionality of I(2) sites. All rats subjected to training proved able to discriminate the training dose of 2-BFI (33 \u03bcmol/kg i.p) from saline vehicle and lower (5-14 \u03bcmol/kg) doses exhibited dose-dependent substitution. The mixed \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor/I( 2) site ligand idazoxan fully substituted at 40\u03bcmol/kg. However, ethoxy idazoxan (11 \u03bcmol/kg) and fluparoxan (13 \u03bcmol/kg), selective \u03b1( 2)-adrenoceptor antagonists, also fully substituted for 2- BFI as did the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors moclobemide (99 \u03bcmol/kg) and pargyline (153 \u03bcmol/kg). A lower dose of moclobemide (16 \u03bcmol/kg) exhibited partial substitution. The \u03b1( 2)-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine (0.1 \u03bcmol/kg) and guanabenz (1.4 \u03bcmol/kg), and the benzodiazepine diazepam (14 \u03bcmol/kg), failed to substitute for 2-BFI indicating cue specificity. However, 2-BFI (14-50 \u03bcmol/kg) substituted partially but dose-dependently for clonidine (0.1 \u03bcmol/kg) in rats trained to distinguish the latter from saline. Changes in rates of response were independent of the degree of substitution. The observed pattern of drug substitution is consistent with the previously reported ability of 2-BFI to decrease MAO activity and thus increase extracellular monoamines.", 
    "94": "The neurosteroid allopregnanolone is a potent and efficacious modulator of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors. The effects of intracerebroventricular injection of allopregnanolone (5 to 15 \u03bcg in 5 \u03bcl) on basal and stress-induced changes in the extracellular concentrations of dopamine were investigated by microdialysis in various brain areas of freely moving rats and compared with those of the benzodiazepine midazolam (1 to 10 \u03bcg in 5 \u03bcl). Allopregnanolone reduced (by a maximum of 65 to 75%) basal dopamine content in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on dopamine output in the striatum. Allopregnanolone (10 to 15 \u03bcg) also completely prevented the increase in extracellular dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex induced by foot-shock stress. Midazolam reduced basal dopamine content in all three brain regions studied as well as the stress- induced increase in dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex with a greater potency than allopregnanolone. These results suggest that endogenous neurosteroids may participate in the GABAergic modulation of dopaminergic transmission in the rat cerebral cortex and nucleus accumbens, two brain areas which are important in the regulation of emotional processes. These agents do not appear to affect striatal dopaminergic transmission which modulates motor function.", 
    "95": "Previous studies have consistently reported deficits in verbal memory following oral lorazepam administration. The possible role of susceptibility to interference effects as a contributory mechanism in benzodiazepine amnesia has not been examined as an independent variable. In addition, most studies of benzodiazepine amnesia have not controlled for the possible confounding effects of alcohol consumption, recently reported to affect the degree of amnesia produced by lorazepam. The present study assessed the verbal memory capabilities of 24 low social drinkers (MAST score < 3) receiving either oral lorazepam (2 mg) or placebo. Interference effects on verbal memory were assessed using the Auditory herbal Learning Test, with either the interference word list (trial B) or a counting backwards task. Lorazepam significantly reduced the recall scores for list B, compared to the first presentation of list A, suggesting lorazepam may increase susceptibility to proactive interference. There was no drug effect on retroactive interference. With regard to recall per se, lorazepam impaired verbal learning for initial acquisition trials (trials 2 and 3) but not subsequent trials, where learning was comparable to the placebo. Lorazepam did not produce significant impairment in immediate and delayed recall trials. This pattern of recall does not conform to the classic profile of benzodiazepine-induced amnesia; potential explanations for this are discussed.", 
    "96": "The effects of four BZ receptor ligands in an operant test were compared with a rotarod test. In the operant test, rats were trained to pull a chain on a schedule that regulates the probability of delivery of food pellets to maintain a steady chain-pulling rate across a 1 h test session. For the rotarod test, mice were trained to remain on a rotarod for 2 min. Diazepam (0.1-3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), FG 8205 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), quazepam (3.0-60.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and zolpidem (0.3-10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) each produced dose-related impairments of performance in both the chain- pulling test and the mouse rotarod test. Furthermore, the impairment in performance induced by FG 8205 (10.0 mg/kg, p.o.) was dose-dependently reversed by the BZ receptor antagonist, flumazenil (1.0-10.0 mg/kg, i.p.), indicating that the chain-pulling deficit was mediated via BZ receptor activation. Diazepam, FG 8205 and quazepam all had comparable potencies in both the rotarod assay and the chain-pulling test. However, zolpidem suppressed the chain-pulling rates at a dose 30-fold lower than that required to induce a significant deficit in the rotarod performance. As zolpidem is a preferentially sedative compound, this pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that the chain-pulling test is sensitive to sedation induced by BZ receptor agonists.", 
    "97": "Ten long-term users of benzodiazepines (average daily dose, 20 mg of diazepam or equivalent) who had experienced problems in withdrawing from the drugs were given an i.v. challenge with either the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (1 mg injected over 30 s) or placebo (vehicle solution) in a randomized double-blind design. There were no 'pseudo withdrawal' responses to either single-blind or double-blind placebo injections, whereas flumazenil produced dramatic panic reactions in all four subjects tested, followed by characteristic benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. There were also small but significant rises in pulse rate and blood pressure, but no change in serum cortisol. Flumazenil-induced panic could not be entirely accounted for by a past or present diagnosis of panic disorder, and did not seem to be related to previous withdrawal problems, present benzodiazepine dosage, or to the severity of withdrawal symptoms precipitated by flumazenil in the same challenge test. Attempts to reduce benzodiazepine intake over the next 3 weeks tended to be more successful in the flumazenil group. The results are discussed with reference to possible changes in the GABA-benzodiazepine system in long-term benzodiazepine users.", 
    "98": "The use of benzodiazepines seems to be associated with a deficit in the levels of arousal and attention during vigil. A number of studies have found residual effects a few hours after the intake of these drugs. This paper assesses the effects of a single dose of 10 mg diazepam on self-informed arousal (as evaluated with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale) and sustained attention (as evaluated with the Toulouse Pi\u00e9ron test) the morning after oral intake (11 hours later). Potential differences in the residual effects of benzodiazepines on men and women were also examined. A sample of 42 healthy young university students (21 female, 21 male) was exposed to three counterbalanced experimental conditions (control, placebo, diazepam). Diazepam only caused a reduction in arousal in women, and this deficit was similar to that caused by the intake of a placebo.", 
    "99": "A survey of the pharmacological and psychological treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) was conducted among 103 physicians, psychologists and psychotherapists. It revealed that the treatments for PDA preferred by the majority of the respondents are inconsistent with the recommendations given in the international literature. Non-psychiatric physicians most frequently proposed herbal preparations as a possible treatment (46% of non-psychiatric physicians), followed by homoeopathic formulations (32%). Tricyclic antidepressants which are recommended as first-line treatment in panic disorder by the literature are preferred by 74% of the psychiatrists, but only by 24% of the non-psychiatric physicians. Benzodiazepines are prescribed by twice as many psychiatrists (45%) as non-psychiatric physicians (22%). Beta blockers and neuroleptics which are not recommended as first-line treatment in panic disorder are used quite often (psychiatrists: 15%; non-psychiatric physicians: 26%). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are prescribed by 24% of the psychiatrists, but by only 3% of the non-psychiatric physicians. Among psychological therapies, psychoanalysis was proposed as first-line treatment by 44% of all professionals applying psychological therapies, while cognitive/behaviour therapy was preferred by only 28%, though proof of efficacy exists only for cognitive/behaviour therapy. In general, psychologists prefer behaviourally-orientated therapy, while physicians mostly propose psychodynamic therapy. One reason for the fact that the results of controlled studies have little influence on professionals treating PDA patients might be that 40% of the respondents do not accept the new classification of the anxiety disorders as introduced in 1980 by the DSM-III.", 
    "100": "The aim of the trial was to assess alpidem efficacy in preventing and treating the benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal syndrome (WS). A multicentre, double-blind, randomized versus placebo, parallel group study of six-week duration was carried out in outpatients suffering from generalized anxiety or adjustment disorder with an anxious mood and taking non-hypnotic BZ as continuous course of therapy of at least one-year duration. At the entry, the patients abruptly discontinued BZs and were treated with 50 mg/bid/tid of alpidem or placebo. Withdrawal syndrome diagnosis was (regarding treatment allocation) formulated by an independent psychiatrist, according to DSM-III-R and an appropriate scale, the SESSB. One hundred seventy-three patients were randomized and 148 completed the study. Withdrawal syndrome occurred in 27 patients of the alpidem group (31.0%) and in 38 patients of the placebo group (44.2%). A severe WS was diagnosed in 11.1% of the patients in the alpidem group and in 31.6% of the placebo group. If not having been withdrawn from the market, alpidem could have been useful for the prevention of BZ withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "101": "This study evaluated the prevalence of benzodiazepine intake by elderly patients presenting at the emergency room of a university hospital. Of 388 patients, 42.5% used one or more benzodiazepine (BZD) drugs in the week prior to admission. There were significantly more women among the BZD users (P < 0.05). Mean duration of intake was long (62 months), but daily dosage was adjusted to age. Of the BZD using patients, 27% took a BZD with long elimination half life. No relationship was found between the BZD intake and the occurrence of falls. Fallers were significantly older (P = 0.019) and were more often women (P = 0.046).", 
    "102": "The plasma levels of 42 patients on a levomethadone maintenance treatment programme for intravenous heroin users were measured before and, respectively, 1, 2 or 4 hours after oral routine administration and related to the individual additional drug usage (detected by urine drug screening), liver function, side-effects and withdrawal symptoms. In general, accelerated levomethadone metabolism induced by additional misuse of benzodiazepines, barbiturates and opiates resulted in significantly lower plasma levels of the substitute. In particular, high gamma-glutamyltransferase activity was related to benzodiazepine consumption. On the other hand, an impaired liver function reflected by increased beta-globulins resulted in an insufficient body clearance and drug accumulation. Major side effects, such as sweating, were not related to plasma levels whereas withdrawal symptoms like diarrhoea or \"feeling cold\" correlate with lower plasma concentrations. It is concluded that polydrug misuse in the methadone maintenance therapy creates a vicious circle of enzyme induction, thus increasing \"instrumental drug utilization\". However, underestimated maintenance dosage may lead to additional drug consumption resulting, finally, in therapeutic failure.", 
    "103": "Compounds interacting with the GABA(A) receptor system modulate voluntary alcohol consumption in alcohol-preferring AA (Alko, Alcohol) rats. Therefore, we compared the central GABA(A) receptor pharmacology of the AA rats to that of their counterpart, alcohol-avoiding ANA (Alko, Non-Alcohol) rats with receptor autoradiography. Total flumazenil-sensitive [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding to the benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) receptor was slightly lower in the hippocampus, striate cortex and lateral hypothalamus of the AA than ANA rats. The proportions of zolpidem- and diazepam-sensitive components were similar in both rat lines. Basal picrotoxin-sensitive [(35)S]TBPS binding to the convulsant site of GABA(A) receptor was similar in most regions between the rat lines, but the up-modulation of the binding by 10 microM diazepam in the hippocampal, amygdaloid and entorhinal cortical areas was greater in the AA than ANA rats. These results do not reveal any general genetic defect in the GABA(A) receptors of AA or ANA rats, but the regional profile of the ligand binding differences between the lines, especially in the coupling of the benzodiazepine and chloride channel sites, suggests receptor subtype-specific changes in brain regions implicated in behavioural reward and anxiolysis.", 
    "104": "Alcohol continues to be one of the most common drugs of abuse. The morbidity and mortality associated with alcohol withdrawal has decreased significantly with the advent of pharmacologic intervention. However, the best method for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome remains controversial. With chronic use, alcohol can disturb the function and balance of several neurotransmitter systems such as excitatory amino acids, GABA, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Compensatory mechanisms in these pathways appear to predominate during chronic use but may become pathologic during withdrawal. As the understanding of alcohol-induced cellular changes increases, treatment of chronic abuse and withdrawal can be refined. Several groups of drugs are efficacious as either primary or adjunct agents in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. This review describes the current theories on the etiology and treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome with emphasis on efficacy, cost, pharmacokinetic parameters, and safety considerations. A proposed withdrawal regimen is also described. Benzodiazepines appear to be the safest and most efficacious choice. With a wide variety of pharmacokinetic parameters and low cost of treatment, they remain the drugs of choice for withdrawal. Ethanol, barbiturates, antiseizure medications, and sympatholytic and sympathomimetic drugs are also reviewed. Newer agents that may have a future role in withdrawal are discussed as well.", 
    "105": "This paper describes three cases of early detection of hypoxia with pulse oximeter during intravenous sedation. In the main study group over 40 patients were monitored by pulse oximetry during large dental operation under i.v.-sedation. Diazepam with soybean oily solvent and midazolam were used as intravenous sedative agents in this study. The first signs of hypoxia were seen by pulse oximetry. In three healthy patients some periods of remarkable hypoxia was detected and those cases are reported in this paper. Two of the patients were treated by a surgical operation and one patient underwent large conservative dental treatment under sedation because of dental care phobia. During the dental treatment period external oxygen was added for all these three patients to avoid more complications as a result of hypoxia. Two of the patients received an injection of benzodiazepine antagonist, too. One patient needed further follow up but non of these patients developed any additional complications. As a conclusion pulse oximetric monitoring was found to be extremely sensitive as a predictor for coming complications as well as allowing early intervention in ventilation problems.", 
    "106": "Bretazenil is a partial agonist at diazepam-sensitive (DS) GABA(A) receptors, and it also binds with high affinity to diazepaminsensitive (DI) GABA(A) receptors. A unique discriminative stimulus effect transduced by binding at DI benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors has been reported in pigeons, but has not been established in rats. Further, differences have been observed between rats and pigeons in results of drug discrimination experiments utilizing BZ receptor partial agonists. Therefore, to examine the discriminative stimulus effects of bretazenil and to explore the possibility of species differences in substitution profiles, pigeons and rats were trained to discriminate 0.3mg/kg bretazenil from vehicle. Flumazenil (0.03-1.0mg/kg) did not substitute for bretazenil in pigeons, despite full substitution of bretazenil for flumazenil in this species. Flumazenil (0.03-10.0mg/kg) also did not substitute for bretazenil in rats, despite the partial agonist effects of flumazenil in rats. Likewise, midazolam (0.3-1.0mg/kg) did not substitute for bretazenil in pigeons, despite the fact that bretazenil partially substitutes for midazolam in pigeons. However in rats, midazolam produced full, dose-dependent substitution (0.03-3.2mg/kg). Differences may result from different fractional receptor occupancy requirements for the mediation of discriminative stimulus effects through DS BZ receptors, and/or from a contribution of DI BZ receptor binding in pigeons.", 
    "107": "Low doses of benzodiazepines produce state-dependence (StD) of food-rewarded lever pressing in rats, and it has been hypothesized that the changes of memory states that can thus be studied constitute the mechanism whereby benzodiazepines cause their characteristic psychopharmacological actions such as anxiolysis, apparent memory loss and dependence. Non-benzodiazepine CNS agents such as NMDA antagonists also produce StD in this procedure, suggesting that the StD hypothesis of psychopharmacological drug action can be expanded to include agents other than benzodiazepines. For this expansion to be possible, however, it must be shown that the StD mechanism operates in a specific manner. The present experiments examined whether varying the extent of food deprivation affects any of a number of quantitative features of chlordiazepoxide (CDP)-induced StD of food-rewarded lever pressing in rats. The data indicate that the CDP doses required to generate StD in both drug-to-saline and dose-to-dose transfer tests, are considerably lower in relatively sated as opposed to more deprived animals; little or no difference was found in tests assaying saline-to-drug transfer. The data add behavioural to available pharmacological evidence supporting the hypothesis that changes of memory state constitute the mechanism whereby CNS agents such as benzodiazepines and NMDA antagonists cause their characteristic psychopharmacological actions. Some directions for future research are identified to explore further the pharmacological and behavioural specificity of drug-produced StD.", 
    "108": "Two sedative anesthetic agents administered by an infusion pump were compared during third molar surgery. Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. All subjects received supplemental oxygen via a nasal hood, fentanyl (0.0007 mg/kg intravenous [i.v.] bolus), and midazolam (1 mg/2 min) titrated to effect. Patients then received either 0.3 mg/kg of methohexital or 0.5 mg/kg of propofol via an infusion pump. Upon completion of the bolus, a continuous infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/min methohexital or 0.066 mg/kg/min propofol was administered throughout the procedure. Hemo-dynamic and respiratory parameters and psychomotor performance were compared for the two groups and no significant differences were found. The continuous infusion method maintained a steady level of sedation. Patients receiving propofol had a smoother sedation as judged by the surgeon and anesthetist.", 
    "109": "Oral midazolam is being used for conscious sedation in dentistry with little documentation assessing its efficacy. In order to accumulate preliminary data, a randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover, multi-site pilot study was conducted. The objective was to determine if 0.6 mg/kg of oral midazolam was an equally effective or superior means of achieving conscious sedation in the uncooperative pediatric dental patient, compared with a commonly used agent, 50 mg/kg of oral chloral hydrate. Twenty-three children in three clinics who required dentistry with local anesthetic and were determined to exhibit behavior rated as \"negative\" or \"definitely negative\" based on the Frankl scale were assessed. They were evaluated with respect to acceptance of medication; initial level of anxiety at each appointment; level of sedation prior to and acceptance of local anesthetic; movement and crying during the procedure; and overall behavior. The results showed that the group randomly assigned to receive midazolam had a significantly greater initial level of anxiety for that appointment (P < 0.02), a finding that could clearly confound further determination of the efficacy of these drugs. Patients given oral midazolam had an increased level of sedation prior to the administration of local anesthetic compared with those given chloral hydrate (P < 0.015). No statistically significant differences were noted in any of the other parameters. The age of the patient was found to have no correlation with the difference in overall behavior (r = -0.09). These preliminary data warrant further clinical trials.", 
    "110": "Since 1989, the epidemiological survey of anaphylactoid reactions occurring during anaesthesia is obtained in France with repeated inquiries by the Perioperative Anaphylactic Reactions Study Group. The members of this group collect during the study period the cases of patients having suffered from an anaphylactoid reaction and tested in their allergo-anaesthetic outpatient clinic, their characteristics (age, gender), the results of the allergological tests (mechanism, agents responsible for the reactions). The two previous surveys published in the Annales fran\u00e7aises d'anesthesie et de r\u00e9animation in 1990 and 1993 included 1,240 and 1,585 patients respectively. The current survey concerned 1,750 patients tested in 27 diagnostic centres, from January 1992 to June 1994. The reactions occurred at all ages, predominantly between 10 and 50 years, the sex-ratio (F/M) was 2.4. Allergological tests carried out to diagnose an immune mechanism for the shock were cutaneous tests in all centres (prick-tests in 21 centres, intradermal tests in 27 centres) using the same dilutions for the tested agents and the same threshold for positivity. Specific IgE antibodies against muscle relaxants, thiopentone and propofol, were measured by radio immunoassays in 20 centres. The leucocyte histamine release test was used in 10 centres. The immune origin of the shock--IgE dependent anaphylaxis--was diagnosed in 1,000 patients (57.8%) and due to 1,030 agents muscle relaxants (59.2%), latex (19%), hypnotics (5.9%), benzodiazepines (2.1%), opioids (3.5%), plasma substitutes (5%), antibiotics (3.1%) and other drugs given during anaesthesia such as aprotinine and protamine (2.2%). Suxamethonium was responsible for 39.3% of muscle relaxant anaphylaxis, vecuronium for 36%, atracurium for 14.5%, pancuronium for 4.8%, gallamine for 3.1% and alcuronium for 2.3%. The latter has been withdrawn from the French market in 1993. These differences in the incidence of reactions are correlated with the clinical use of muscle relaxants in France for vecuronium and atracurium, however not for suxamethonium, responsible for 39% of the reactions but representing only 5% of the muscle relaxants sold in France. The comparison with the two previous surveys confirms that the mechanism of more than half of the anaphylactoid reactions occurring during anaesthesia is of immune origin, due to specific IgE antibodies. It is therefore essential to systematically carry out an allergologic assessment several weeks after the reaction, in order to discard for the subsequent anaesthetics the agent(s) responsible for anaphylaxis. If the muscle relaxants remain the first drugs involved in shock occurring at induction, there is a significant increase in latex shock, as demonstrated by the three epidemiological surveys (0.5%, 12.5% and now 19%). The incidence of other anaesthetic agents, antibiotics and plasma substitutes remains unchanged.", 
    "111": "The authors report the case of a patient who experienced intracardiac conduction disturbances from accidental intravenous injection of bupivacaine, which were reversed by an intravenous injection of flumazenil. Flumazenil could act either in displacing bupivacaine from its binding site, or by an interaction involving the GABAergic system, unless a specific interaction between flumazenil and bupivacaine does exist. In case of experimental confirmation of this feature, flumazenil could be proposed as a new therapeutic tool for bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity.",

    "113": "We report the case of a young female drug addict (benzodiazepines and alcohol) who denied overuse of amineptine. The initial inflammatory aspect of the lesion was unusual as was the histology report. The sebaceous glands were the site of cystic dilatation as would be expected, but in addition the sudoriparous glands showed keratinizing syringometaplasia with areas of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.", 
    "114": "This is the second report of such a case similar to other due to chemotherapy, benaxoprofene or toxic agents for example, and corresponds to direct toxicity to the sudoriparous glands which accumulate amineptine. We therefore propose the term of adnexal toxic drug eruption.", 
    "115": "Blood platelet phenolsulphotransferase and monoamine oxidase activities, as well as platelet peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding have been studied in several neuropsychiatric disorders, in order to identify biochemical markers for altered brain functioning. In the present work, we determined platelet phenolsulphotransferase and monoamine oxidase activities in demented patients: they showed significantly higher phenolsulphotransferase and monoamine oxidase activities than controls. A significant positive correlation was found between enzyme activities and severity of illness. In the same subjects, we evaluated platelet peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding: a significant reduction of Bmax values was observed in demented patients, whereas Kd values did not substantially differ between the two subject groups. These findings are discussed with reference to central nervous system biochemical abnormalities of demented subjects: it may be that in Dementia of Alzheimer type either some central biochemical changes are reflected in certain peripheral tissues (such as platelets), or a systemic derangement occurs together with a cerebral involvement.",

    "117": "A randomised controlled trial of 286 NSW general practitioners conducted during 1991 and 1992.", 
    "118": "The educational visit was statistically significant in reducing the number of new prescriptions recorded by general practitioners for new diagnoses of insomnia. However, the majority of benzodiazepine prescriptions were for patients continuing treatment for insomnia or anxiety/depression. Overall, benzodiazepines were the sole management of insomnia recorded by the surveyed GPs in most cases (93.5%). In comparison, non-drug management for anxiety and depression was offered to more than a third of patients with anxiety and depression. (Benzodiazepines were the only management of anxiety and depression in just over 50% of cases.)", 
    "119": "This study shows general practitioners can change their management of insomnia and that change is most likely to occur when the problem is new, rather than old. The decreased emphasis on drug treatment in the general practice management of anxiety and depression may reflect the change in psychiatric teaching for these conditions. Further, most of the publicity about benzodiazepines has been in relation to their use for anxiety disorders. Doctors were interested in learning about advances in the understanding of sleep disorders and their non-drug management.", 
    "120": "Midazolam administered ip. in albino rats (each group consisted from 10 animals rendered hyperdyslipidemic by the administration of Triton WR-1339) induced at most doses a significant reduction of glycemia (p < 0.001). However, the reduction of blood glucose level was outside of the dangerous level. Midazolam elicited also very significant decrease of the elevated serum lipids (p < 0.001). The pharmacological analysis of these phenomena by using the peripheral type benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors antagonist PK 11105, the central BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil and the purinergic P1 receptors antagonist aminophylline has shown that the effects on serum lipids were due, very probably to the stimulation of the peripheral type BZD receptors. Aminophylline seems to have the property to block the peripheral type BZD receptors. The effects on blood glucose level were very variable.",
