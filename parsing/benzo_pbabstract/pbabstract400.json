An appropriate number and type of substituents on the terminal nitrogens of a tetraamine backbone afforded compounds, such as tripitramine (8) and dipitramine (6), which are endowed with different affinity and selectivity profiles. Tripitramine, a nonsymmetrical tetraamine, resulted in the most potent and the most selective M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist so far available (pA2 = 9.75 +/- 0.02; pKi = 9.54 +/- 0.08). However, it failed to discriminate between M1 and M4 muscarinic receptor subtypes (selectivity ratio: M2/M3, 1600-2200; M2/M1, 81; M2/M4, 41; M1/M3, 28; M4/M3, 55; M4/M1, 2). Dipitramine, another nonsymmetrical tetraamine bearing two substituents on the same terminal nitrogen, displayed the highest affinity for M1 muscarinic receptors (pKi = 8.60 +/- 0.15) and was able to differentiate, unlike 8, all four muscarinic receptor subtypes investigated (selectivity ratio: M1/M2, 5; M1/M3, 2700; M1/M4, 76; M2/M3, 260-520; M2/M4, 15; M4/M3, 35). The results are discussed in terms of a possible mode of interaction of tetraamines with muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "1": "The effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands with different intrinsic activity profiles were studied on voluntary ethanol consumption in the selectively bred alcohol-preferring AA (Alko, Alcohol) rat line, and compared to those of an opiate antagonist, naloxone, and a serotonin uptake inhibitor, citalopram. The rats were first allowed to develop a strong preference for 10% (v/v) ethanol solution in tap water over plain water until their ethanol consumption stabilized. Thereafter, the period when ethanol solution was available for the rats was gradually reduced to 4 h, 3 times a week, every second working day. The acute effects of positive allosteric modulators (agonists) of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptor [midazolam, abecarnil, ethyl 5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (ZK 91296), bretazenil, and 2,5-dihydro-2-(4-methylphenyl)-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-C]quinolin-3(5H)-on e (CGS 9895)] and of negative allosteric modulators [inverse agonists, ethyl 8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5- a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-4513) and t-butyl 5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a]thieno[2,3- f][1,4]diazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 19-4603)] were tested after i.p. injections of three different drug doses using saline injections as a control treatment. The benzodiazepine agonists had rather modest effects on ethanol intake, measured 1 and 4 h after the injections, whereas the inverse agonists and naloxone strongly decreased ethanol consumption. Acute citalopram had no clear effect on ethanol drinking, but it slightly decreased the consumption of novel food during the 4-h session, as did all other benzodiazepine agonists except bretazenil. Neither the inverse agonists nor naloxone had any significant effect on food intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Recent reports suggest that a cholecystokinin (CCK)-related dysfunction may be a target by which drugs can modulate anxiety and panic disorders. In the present study, effects of subchronic (14 days) treatment with the monoamine uptake inhibitors nortriptyline (30 mumol/kg per day), amitriptyline (29 mumol/kg per day), clomipramine (32 mumol/kg per day) and alaproclate (39 mumol/kg per day), as well as with the benzodiazepine clonazepam (0.25 mumol/kg per day), on rat brain levels of CCK- and substance P-like immunoreactivity, were compared. The drugs were administered by continuous s.c. infusion using implanted osmotic pumps. The plasma concentrations of the monoamine uptake inhibitors were similar after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, indicating that steady-state plasma levels had been reached during the first week. Treatment with clomipramine or clonazepam increased the CCK-like immunoreactivity level in the ventral tegmental area (by 64.4 +/- 28.8% and 105.1 +/- 28.8%, respectively) and in the cingulate cortex (by 30.3 +/- 10.1% and 36.0 +/- 11.8%, respectively) (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Clomipramine also significantly increased the CCK-like immunoreactivity level in the periaqueductal grey by 85.1 +/- 29.7%. Neither nortriptyline nor amitriptyline or alaproclate produced any significant alterations in the CCK- or substance P-like immunoreactivity levels in the areas examined. The present results may suggest that an altered utilization of CCK in limbic circuits could be of importance for the well documented clinical effect of clomipramine and clonazepam in panic disorders.", 
    "3": "Muscarinic toxin 3 (MT3) (65 amino acids, four disulphides, M(r) 7379) was isolated from the venom of the African snake Dendroaspis angusticeps (green mamba) and its amino acid sequence determined. Its ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) to Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing subtypes of muscarinic receptors was studied. MT3 displayed high affinity for the m4 receptor (pKi = 8.7 +/- 0.06), 40-fold lower affinity at ml receptors (pKi = 7.11 +/- 0.17) whereas no inhibition of [3H]NMS binding to m2, m3 and m5 receptors was observed at concentrations up to 1 microM. This makes MT3 the most selective m4 receptor ligand known to date.", 
    "4": "The analgesic effect of systemic morphine (4 mg/kg, s.c.) was antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) (0.1-0.5 ng) administered bilaterally to the nucleus accumbens of the rat. This effect of CCK-8 could be reversed by devazepide, a CCK-A receptor antagonist, at 50 ng and 200 ng and by L-365,260, a CCK-B receptor antagonist, at 5 ng administered bilaterally to the nucleus accumbens. A marked potentiation of morphine analgesia was achieved by intra-nucleus accumbens injection of 200 ng devazepide or 5 ng L-365,260. Since the effect of L-365,260 in antagonizing the anti-opioid effect of CCK-8 in the nucleus accumbens is 40 times more potent than devazepide, it is suggested that the anti-opioid effect of CCK-8 is mediated by CCK-B receptors. In conclusion, nucleus accumbens is a strategic site where CCK-8 exerts an anti-opioid activity, most probably via the CCK-B receptors.", 
    "5": "The interstrand cross-linked DSB-120-d(CICG*ATCICG)2 DNA adduct (*indicates covalently modified guanine) was examined by two-dimensional NMR and compared to the bis-tomaymycin adduct on the same oligomer. Tomaymycin and DSB-120 form self-complementary adducts with the d(CICGATCICG)2 duplex sequence in which the covalent linkage sites occur between C11 of either drug and the exocyclic 2-amino group of the single reactive guanine on each strand of d(CICGATCICG)2. In the case of DSB-120, this is evidence for the formation of a guanine--guanine DNA interstrand cross-link. Both drugs show formation of an S stereo-chemistry at the covalent linkage site with an associated 3' orientation. While the majority of DNA in these adducts appears to be B-form, DSB-120 interstrand cross-linking induces atypical properties in the 8I nucleotide, indicated by broadening of the 8IH2 proton resonance, non-C2' endo sugar geometry, and unusually weak internucleotide NOE connectivity to the 7C nucleotide. Tomaymycin does not produce this regional dislocation. For tomaymycin, while there are strong NOE connectivities from protons on the five-membered ring to the 8IH2 proton on the floor of the minor groove, the equivalent internucleotide connectivities in DSB-120 are weaker. This indicates that the tomaymycin tail is close to the floor of the minor groove, while the five-membered ring of DSB-120 is more shallowly immersed, perhaps due to strain from cross-linking with a very short linker unit. Last, the conformational stresses induced on the duplex by DSB-120 appear to make the region of covalent attachment more accessible to solvent than is the case for tomaymycin. The 4GN2Hb resonance appears in 100% D2O on the tomaymycin adduct but is only observed in 90% H2O/10% D2O for the DSB-120 adduct. On the basis of these results, the strategies for template-directed DNA cross-linker design are assessed.", 
    "6": "The modulation of cyclic AMP dependent neurosteroidogenesis was studied in minces prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rat. Forskolin or dibutyryl-cyclic AMP enhanced pregnenolone and progesterone production in a time and dose-dependent manner. The forskolin effect was mimicked by the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl-methyl-xanthine, but not by the adenylate cyclase inactive forskolin analogue 1,9,dideoxy-forskolin. 4'-Chloro-diazepam, a high affinity ligand for the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptor, also elicited a time dependent increase in steroidogenesis. The forskolin and the 4'-chloro-diazepam stimulated pregnenolone increase was prevented by preexposing the rat brain cortical minces to 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK 11195), a high affinity ligand for the mitochondrial DBI receptor endowed with antagonistic properties. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prevented the forskolin and 4'-chloro-diazepam stimulation of pregnenolone formation. In brain cortical minces of adrenalectomised/orchiectomised rats dibutyryl-cyclic AMP increased both pregnenolone and progesterone formation, while forskolin only increased progesterone. These data show that cyclic AMP enhances brain steroidogenesis by acting on a labile protein substrate which interacts with the mitochondrial DBI receptor.", 
    "7": "The aim of this study was to characterise the muscarinic receptor present in the uterus of the virgin rat. Homogenate binding studies were undertaken using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate as the radioligand and atropine (10 microM) to determine non-specific binding. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding was saturable with a Kd of 63 pM and a Bmax of 3 fmol/mg protein. The pKi values obtained using antagonists with high affinity for differing muscarinic receptor subtypes were pirenzepine, 6.2; hexahydrosiladifenidol, 6.9; AF-DX 116 (11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]5,11-dihydro-6H - pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one), 7.0; and himbacine, 7.8. These findings suggest that muscarinic M2 receptors are present in rat uterus.",

    "14": "New knowledge concerning the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux gives an opportunity for updating measures of conservative antireflux treatment. There are only few controlled trials, and it is uncertain whether the requirement for pharmacological treatment may hereby be diminished. General advice such as eating small meals, reducing the fat intake, avoiding food intake for three hours before bedtime are recommended to all, while advice on more specific foods should be individualized according to actual food related symptoms. Patients with annoying symptoms of reflux are advised not to consume alcohol every day, while the consumption of tobacco seems to be of minor importance. Advising weight loss isn't well founded, but ought to be given to obese patients. Elevation of the head of the bed is suggested to patients with nocturnal symptoms of reflux, which usually coincide with the presence of a hiatal hernia. If possible, revision of other current pharmacotherapy should be done. Theophylline, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, seem in particular to be able to provoke or aggravate reflux. Patient support groups with medical supervision might be useful and reduce the number of consultations. The non-pharmacological measures should still be the basis of treatment and it might be sufficient in mild cases. It is recommended that the advise be individualized to each patient in such a way that no unfounded changes of life style are recommended that impair the quality of life.

    "15": "Although midazolam is used for sedation of mechanically ventilated newborn babies, this treatment has not been evaluated in a randomised trial. We have done a prospective placebo-controlled study of the effects of midazolam on haemodynamic variables and sedation as judged by a five-item behaviour score. 46 newborn babies on mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome were randomly assigned to receive midazolam (n = 24) or placebo (n = 22) as a continuous infusion. Doses of midazolam were calculated to obtain plasma concentrations between 200 and 1000 ng/mL within 24 h of starting treatment and to maintain these values throughout the study. Haemodynamic and ventilatory variables were noted every hour, as were complications and possible side-effects of treatment. Mean (SD) duration of inclusion was 78.7 (30.9) h. 1 patient in the treatment group and 7 in the placebo group were withdrawn because of inadequate sedation (p < 0.05). Midazolam gave a significantly better sedative effect than placebo, as estimated by the behaviour score (p < 0.05). Heart rate and blood pressure were reduced by treatment but remained within the normal range for gestational age and there was no effect on ventilatory indices. The incidence of complications was similar in the two groups. No midazolam-related side-effects were noted. Continuous infusion of midazolam at doses adapted to gestational age induces effective sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation, with positive effects on haemodynamic variables. The course of the respiratory distress syndrome was not influenced by this treatment. Midazolam was given over only a few days and the limited effects on heart rate and blood pressure that we report should not encourage long-term administration.",

    "17": "The polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and drug ligands for the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) have been shown to regulate cholesterol transport, the rate-determining step in steroidogenesis, in hormone-responsive steroidogenic cells including the MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. The present study was designed to characterize the role of DBI and PBR in the R2C rat Leydig tumor constitutive steroid-producing cell model. Both DBI and PBR were present in R2C cells. R2C cell treatment with a cholesterol-linked phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to DBI, but not sense, resulted in the reduction of DBI levels and a concomitant dramatic decrease of the amount of progesterone produced. These observations strongly suggested that DBI was important in maintaining constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C cells. Radioligand binding assays revealed the presence of a single class of PBR binding sites with an affinity 10 times higher (Kd approximately 0.5 nM) than that displayed by the MA-10 PBR (Kd approximately 5 nM). Photolabeling of R2C and MA-10 cell mitochondria with the photoactivatable PBR ligand [3H]1-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3- isoquinolinecarboxamide showed that the M(r) 18,000 PBR protein was specifically labeled. This indicates that the R2C cells express a PBR protein which has properties similar to the MA-10 PBR. Chemical crosslinking studies of purified metabolically radiolabeled DBI to mitochondria provided direct evidence that DBI specifically binds to the M(r) 18,000 PBR protein. Moreover, DBI and a PBR synthetic ligand were able to increase steroid production in isolated R2C cell mitochondria which express the 5 nM affinity receptor. However, mitochondrial PBR binding was increased by 6-fold upon addition of the post-mitochondrial fraction, suggesting that a cytosolic factor modulates the binding properties of PBR in R2C cells and is responsible for the 0.5 nM affinity receptor seen in intact cells. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that DBI plays a key role in maintaining R2C constitutive steroidogenesis by binding to the mitochondrial higher affinity PBR which promotes a continuous supply of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial side chain cleavage cytochrome P450.", 
    "18": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBZr) binding sites in isolated mitochondrial (m-fractions) and microsomal fractions (p-fractions) from androgen sensitive R-3327 Dunning G and H tumors were studied. Binding in both m- and p-fractions of these tumors was specific, saturable, and of high affinity. A very high density of PBZr was found in m-fraction from both types of tumors. In p-fractions the receptor density was 4- and 7-fold lower than m-fractions from G and H tumors respectively. Receptor densities in both m- and p-fractions from the poorly differentiated fast growing G turner was significantly higher than in the corresponding fractions from the well differentiated slow growing H tumor. These data suggest that in the androgen sensitive prostatic tumors the density of PBZr may be influenced by the growth rate and degree of differentiation.",

In hospitals, most of the patients receiving these drugs are psychiatric patients. This study aims at describing patterns of prescribing these drugs in Saudi Arabia that may be different from that in other countries due to greater legal restriction on psychotropic medications in general. It is a retrospective analysis of charts of the first 100 patients admitted to King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) from 1 January 1989 to the medical, surgical, psychiatric, and obstetric and gynecology wards. The results are compared to a methodologically similar study from Canada. Generally, SHDs were more frequently prescribed in Canada than in Saudi Arabia. Most of the SHDs were prescribed in the surgical ward and most of the indications in both studies were medical. These and other findings are discussed in the context of cultural aspects in Saudi Arabia.",

She had action and intention myoclonus, and these movements were also initiated by acoustic and pain stimuli.

Those with possible head injury were subjected to computed tomography of the head once stabilized. Adjuvant analgesia with an intravenous opiate was required in less than 40% of patients, and the amnesic properties of midazolam were found to be excellent. Cardiorespiratory side effects were not seen. Midazolam was found to be a safe and viable alternative to muscle relaxants, allowing endotracheal intubation and ventilation, in addition to other invasive procedures, to be carried out with minimal distress to the patient.",

In the present study we used the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique to determine which of these cell lines express functional GABAA receptors. All of the cell lines contain detectable levels of at least one GABAA receptor subunit mRNA (Tyndale et al., 1994); however, only RINm5F and beta TC3 cells exhibited GABA-evoked currents. GABA activated currents in all RINm5F cells, but currents were only barely detectable in 50% of beta TC3 cells tested. Many of the cell lines that failed to respond to GABA were derived from cell types with functional GABAA receptors. For example, the failure of PC12 cells to respond to GABA contrasts with the observation of GABA responses recorded from all primary cultured adrenomedullary chromaffin cells tested. GABA-evoked currents recorded from beta TC3 cells were too small (< 10 pA) to characterize pharmacologically. However, GABA activated robust currents recorded from RINm5F cells. These currents reversed at a holding potential similar to the equilibrium potential for Cl-, were blocked by the antagonist bicuculline methiodide (10 microM), and were potentiated by pentobarbital (100 microM). RINm5F cell GABAA receptors were insensitive to diazepam (10 microM) and were inhibited by Zn2+ (10 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Human immunodeficiency virus infects different cell types including CD4+ lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). We have examined the activity of the HIV-1 Tat inhibitors Ro-5-3335 and Ro-24-7429 in cultured human peripheral MDMs. Monocytes were isolated from HIV-seronegative donors by gradient centrifugation and plastic adherence. MDMs and unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were infected with HIV Ba-L and then treated with drug either immediately (acute infection) or after 4 days (PBMCs) or 14 days (MDMs) (chronic infection). Inhibition of HIV replication by each drug was assessed by quantitation of HIV p24 antigen in culture supernatant using an enzyme immunoassay. In acutely infected MDMs, Ro-5-3335 (10 microM) and Ro-24-7429 (10 microM) resulted in 77% and 99% mean inhibition, respectively, of HIV replication with a clear dose response at lower concentrations; chronically infected MDMs were much less susceptible to these drugs, with both compounds inhibiting p24 antigen production by less than 50% at 10 microM. The drugs had no deleterious effect on cell viability at any concentration tested. In acutely infected PBMCs Ro-5-3335 and Ro-24-7429 resulted in 68% and 68.5% mean inhibition at 10 microM; when the compounds were added 4 days after infection inhibition was less than 50% compared with controls. Thus, the Tat inhibitors were effective in inhibiting acute HIV infection in MDMs but not in chronically infected cells, findings that differ from those of published studies using continuous lymphoblastoid cell lines.",

    "34": "Midazolam at sedative doses induces an increase in upper airway resistance, but its effects on the work of breathing have not been established. The flow-resistive work of breathing and pulmonary resistance (RL) of eight healthy volunteers were measured, with either midazolam 0.1 mg/kg or placebo in a random order. Esophageal pressures were measured using a balloon-tipped catheter, airflow using a pneumotachograph. Total resistive work expressed per minute (WTOT) and per liter of ventilation (WTOT/VE), and their inspiratory (WI) and expiratory (WE) components were determined. No change was observed after placebo injection. Five minutes after midazolam injection, an increase was observed in WTOT (from 3 +/- 0.4 J/min [mean +/- SEM] at control to 6.3 +/- 1.1 J/min; P < 0.01) and in WTOT/VE (from 360 +/- 30 mJ/L at control to 1250 +/- 120 mJ/L; P < 0.01), involving both WI and WE components. An increased inspiratory RL was observed from 13.7 +/- 2.6 cm H2O.L-1.s-1 at control to 32.8 +/- 3.9 cm H2O.L-1.s-1 after midazolam. Changes in inspiratory RL were correlated to changes in WI and WI/VE (r = 0.574, P < 0.001; and r = 0.762, P < 0.001, respectively). Our results suggest that airway obstruction plays a major role in the increased work of breathing observed during sedation with midazolam.", 
    "35": "Epidural steroids (ESI) are often used for the treatment of low back pain but their effects on the endocrine system have not been determined. We studied the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in 14 patients by measuring plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) by sensitive two-site immunoradiometric assay and by evaluating the acute cortisol response to cosyntropin. We also evaluated the additional impact of sedation with midazolam before ESI on the degree of suppression of the HPA axis. Plasma ACTH and cortisol were significantly suppressed 7 days after the first ESI; the group receiving midazolam was more suppressed. By 14 days after the first ESI (7 days after the second ESI), plasma ACTH was more suppressed in the group receiving midazolam and plasma cortisol was markedly suppressed in both groups. At 48 days after the first ESI (34 days after the third ESI), plasma ACTH and cortisol were significantly suppressed only in the group that had received midazolam before each ESI. At 48 days, the plasma cortisol response to cosyntropin was blunted (< 500 nmol/L) in 5 of 14 patients. All patients had a normal cortisol response to cosyntropin by 3 mo after the last ESI. Weekly ESI over 3 wk caused a dramatic acute and chronic suppression of the HPA axis. Median suppression was less than 1 mo, and all patients had recovered by 3 mo. Sedation with midazolam accentuated the suppression of the HPA axis.

Diabetes was induced by the intravenous injection of 65 mg./kg. streptozotocin (STZ). The density of muscarinic receptors (Bmax values), as determined by saturation experiments with [3H]QNB, was demonstrated to be higher in the vas deferens of diabetic rats than in the vas deferens of control and diabetic insulin-treated rats. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values), however, were similar in all three groups. Muscarinic cholinergic antagonists competed with [3H]QNB binding sites in the vas deferens membrane particulates with the following rank order of Ki values: atropine < methoctramine < or = 4-DAMP < AF-DX 116 < HHSiD < pirenzepine = pfHHSiD. The pharmacological profile of muscarinic receptors was similar in all three groups. Additional pharmacological studies showed a similar rank order of Ki values for vas deferens, bladder dome and heart, but this rank order was significantly different in cerebral cortex and prostate. This is consistent with the predominance of the M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype in the rat vas deferens. It is concluded that STZ-induced diabetes causes an upregulation of muscarinic cholinergic receptor density in the rat vas deferens that can be prevented by the administration of insulin.",

In addition, GABAA receptors not only bound to microtubules but also coassembled with added tubulin through three cycles of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization. These data indicate that GABAA receptors may be associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton in the brain. In an experiment designed to detect a protein that possibly could form a bridge between tubulin and the GABAA receptor, only a single protein band containing tubulin could be identified that was able to bind polymerized tubulin after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of affinity-purified GABAA receptors. These results are discussed with respect to a possible mechanism of association between GABAA receptors and microtubules.", 
    "49": "As the control of acute chemotherapy-induced emesis has improved, delayed emesis (occurring 24 h or more after treatment) has become the most bothersome vomiting problem. Delayed vomiting occurs after treatment with many anticancer drugs, but has been most often studied following cisplatin or combinations of cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines. The mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. Empirical trials of antiemetic agents effective in controlling acute emesis identified the combination of metoclopramide and dexamethasone as useful in lessening delayed emesis after displatin in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. The specific serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonist ondansetron yielded results equivalent to the prior placebo results in a phase II trial using identical methodology in similar patients given cisplatin. Following anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combination chemotherapy, the delayed vomiting prevention observed with dexamethasone alone exceeds that of ondansetron. These observations suggest that delayed emesis is primarily mediated by neurotransmitters other than serotonin. Since delayed emesis occurs more frequently in patients who experience nausea and vomiting on the day they receive chemotherapy, tested combination antiemetic regimens, employing a 5-HT3 antagonist (either granisetron, metoclopramide, ondansetron or tropisetron), dexamethasone, and a benzodiazepine (lorazepam and alprazolam) should be routinely employed. This approach provides the best protection for acute and delayed emesis. Further research, looking beyond the specific 5-HT3 antagonists, provides the best strategy to improve the control of delayed symptoms.",

We assessed the guidelines' impact on prescribing habits, benzodiazepine dosage requirements and costs, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. A 6-month prospective, observational study was performed in 50 patients who exhibited signs of alcohol withdrawal and received benzodiazepine therapy. Appropriate therapy was defined as lorazepam for patients 60 years and older or those with hepatic dysfunction, and chlordiazepoxide for all other patients. Benzodiazepine costs were calculated based on acquisition cost. Based on our guidelines, 76% of patients were appropriate candidates for a long-acting agent such as chlordiazepoxide; 61% of these candidates actually received such a drug. Using a benzodiazepine conversion to compare doses in chlordiazepoxide equivalents, there was a significant difference in the total mean dose of chlordiazepoxide (1295.5 mg, SD +/- 1571) compared with lorazepam (365.5 mg; SD +/- 446) (p < 0.01). The mean total chlordiazepoxide acquisition cost was $61.74 (range $0.03-585.98) per patient (28 patients); prior to adoption of the guidelines, the mean cost of benzodiazepine therapy was $1008.72 (+/- $1554.45). For patients receiving chlordiazepoxide, the mean days of ICU and hospital stay were 1.1 days (range 0-9 days) and 5.6 days (range 1-17 days), respectively; before adoption of the guidelines, the mean number of days of ICU stay was significantly greater (4.1 days, p < 0.0001).

We attempted to determine the length and type of hospital stay, and the pattern and appropriateness of administration, dosage requirements, and costs associated with benzodiazepines in patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal. A 1-year retrospective analysis was performed for 57 hospitalized patients. Appropriate therapy was defined as lorazepam for patients 60 years and older or those with hepatic dysfunction, and chlordiazepoxide or diazepam for all other patients. Drug costs were calculated based on acquisition costs. The mean number of days of benzodiazepine treatment and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) were 6.2 days (range 1-30 days) and 3.9 days (range 0-12 day), respectively. Fifty-six patients were admitted to the ICU for management or for monitoring continuous-infusion lorazepam; one patient received chlordiazepoxide on a general ward. Total mean lorazepam infusion required per patient was 324 mg (range 2-5956 mg). The total benzodiazepine acquisition cost was $56,489 (mean $1009, range $0.06-7157/patient). The total costs of benzodiazepine acquisition and ICU charge were $404,346 (mean $7462/patient). Based on our criteria, 41 of 57 patients could have been treated appropriately with chlordiazepoxide, which would have resulted in an estimated drug-acquisition cost savings of at least $37,000. Mean benzodiazepine dosage requirements in patients hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal appear higher than previously reported. Approximately 70% of our patients were not of advanced age and had no evidence of organ dysfunction, and therefore, could have been treated with an oxidized benzodiazepine (i.e., chlordiazepoxide).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Acute extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS), including dystonia, parkinsonism, and akathisia, are associated with the use of virtually all neuroleptic agents.

Akathisia may be only partly dispelled by anticholinergics; alternatives are beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, and clonidine. In patients receiving long-term neuroleptic therapy, both the prophylactic use and the duration of treatment with concomitant anti-EPS drugs are controversial. Administration of prophylactic anti-EPS drugs should be based on the likelihood that the patient will develop EPS, as well as the risk of adverse reactions resulting from extended use of the agents in a specific patient. The decision to continue anti-EPS therapy should be reevaluated frequently, especially in elderly patients.",

Detection limits of the most commonly used benzodiazepines and their major metabolites were determined. In all cases, the detection limits were lower than the cutoff values specified for the Syva EMIT d.a.u. benzodiazepine assay. Thirty-three urine samples for routine drug screening were tested for benzodiazepines by RRA and EMIT. Results were compared with those obtained by a highly specific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. Five commonly used benzodiazepines and their major metabolites were identified by use of a computerized multichannel photodetector. We obtained two false-negative results by RRA when compared with HPLC. These may be caused by conjugate formation. The inclusion of a simple enzymatic hydrolysis improves the detection of compounds excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates (e.g., oxazepam). We conclude that the combination of enzymatic hydrolysis and direct RRA provides a rapid and acceptable method for detection of the presence of benzodiazepines in urine samples.",

The possibility that the GABAA receptor/chloride channel was the receptor that mediated the progesterone-induced calcium influx in human sperm was examined. A-ring reduced 3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane steroids (e.g. alfaxalone, allopregnanolone, pregnanolone), which are active on the GABAA receptor/chloride channel, were found to be much weaker than progesterone at stimulating Ca2+ influx in sperm. The effects of a variety of progesterone metabolites and analogs and other steroids were compared for their ability to (i) stimulate GABA-induced 36Cl- uptake in synaptoneurosomes, (ii) stimulate GABA-induced Cl- currents in HEK-293 cells transfected with alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunits of the GABAA receptor/chloride complex, and (iii) elicit a rapid Ca2+ influx in sperm. No correlation was observed between the ability of a given steroid to stimulate Ca2+ influx and efficacy in eliciting either 36Cl- uptake or chloride currents. Importantly, the action of progesterone to stimulate Ca2+ influx was not modified by GABA, diazepam, picrotoxin and pentobarbitol (known regulators of the GABAA receptor/chloride channel).

In this study, eight healthy male volunteers were given oral diazepam (10 mg), midazolam (15 mg) and placebo in a random double-blind cross-over fashion. Metabolic responses were measured using an indirect calorimetry device. Subjective responses were measured using a visual analogue scale. Plasma concentrations of diazepam, midazolam and desmethyldiazepam were analysed and correlated to changes in metabolic and subjective responses. When compared to placebo, both diazepam and midazolam significantly decreased oxygen consumption (P < 0.01 in pairwise comparisons) and energy expenditure (P < 0.01 in pairwise comparisons). While there was a significant correlation between the plasma concentrations of diazepam and the changes in metabolic parameters, no such correlation was found with midazolam. Both diazepam and midazolam were subjectively more sedative than placebo (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the sedative effects of diazepam and midazolam, but diazepam was subjectively better tolerated than midazolam.

We generally administer 7.5 mg Midazolam orally for light sedation; antibiotics are not required. This method expands the possibility of voice prosthesis fitting in patients who are not considered or willing to have general anesthesia for various reasons. In 33 cases we did not see any complication. In two cases the tracheal wall was too tight due to radiation therapy, so that an operation had to be performed later on in general anesthesia. In one case technical problems led to an operation in local anesthesia in two steps. In all cases the patients did not complain of any considerable discomfort.", 
    "61": "Etomidate is a hypnotic with only minor effects on haemodynamics. Although its rapid elimination kinetics would suggest its use in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and sedation, its administration in higher doses or for a prolonged period has been discouraged due to its inhibitory effects on corticosteroid synthesis. Newer evidence that the suppression of cortisol synthesis might not be total requires a re-evaluation of this drug as a component of a TIVA technique. The effects of high-dose etomidate with fentanyl on spontaneous and stimulated corticosteroid levels as a measure of the magnitude and duration of adrenocortical suppression, as well as on plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) beta-endorphin, and catecholamines during cardiac surgery were investigated in a prospective, randomised study and compared to those following the administration of midazolam-fentanyl. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Nineteen patients undergoing myocardial revascularisation were assigned to two groups: group 1: etomidate-fentanyl (n = 9) and group 2: midazolam-fentanyl (n = 10). Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 0.5 mg and either etomidate 0.3 mg/kg or midazolam 0.2 mg/kg. Relaxation was achieved with pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anaesthesia was maintained during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) with an infusion of etomidate (0.36 mg.kg-1.h-1) or midazolam (0.16 mg.kg-1.h-1) and fentanyl 10 micrograms.kg-1.h-1. Blood samples were drawn before induction, before ECC, and 1, 6, and 20 h after surgery. Cortisol secretion was stimulated with 0.25 mg ACTH1-24 IV at 6 and 20 h postoperatively. RESULTS. The total drug doses were etomidate 87 +/- 3 mg and midazolam 46 +/- 2 mg. Plasma cortisol concentrations decreased in the etomidate group from 20 (10-31) to 10 (6-31) micrograms.dl-1 (median and range) before ECC, but had returned to baseline at 1 h and were significantly increased at 6 h [29 (15-47) micrograms.dl-1] and 20 h [46 (29-62) micrograms.dl-1]. There was no difference between the groups except at 20 h, when cortisol levels were higher in the etomidate group. The stimulated cortisol increase was markedly impaired in this group at both measuring points. ACTH and beta-endorphin were markedly increased in the etomidate group and ACTH concentrations were eight times greater than the corresponding values in the midazolam group after surgery (ACTH 141 vs. 18 pmol.l-1). Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased significantly in both groups. Noradrenaline concentrations were greater in the etomidate group at 6 h after surgery. Two patients in the midazolam group and none in the etomidate group required circulatory support with exogenous catecholamines. DISCUSSION. It is concluded that the stress of cardiac surgery can overcome the block in cortisol synthesis caused by the administration of high-dose etomidate by substantially increasing ACTH secretion. The administration of high-dose etomidate was not associated with cardiovascular instability. The use of etomidate as a component of TIVA can therefore not be ruled out on the grounds of insufficient cortisol secretion.",

    "64": "Possible interactions of ACTH-like peptides with melatonin regulation of central-type benzodiazepine (BNZ) receptors have been studied by means of high-affinity 3H-flunitrazepam binding to rat cerebral cortex membrane preparations. Intracerebroventricular injections of melatonin produce a dose-dependent increase in Bmax in pinealectomized rats, without changes in KD. Analogous effects were obtained after intracerebroventricular injection of melatonin in adrenalectomized and in adrenalectomized plus pinealectomized rats, which indicated the lack of participation of adrenal steroids in this response. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of ACTH1-10 induced a similar dose-dependent increased Bmax in sham-operated animals, whereas pinealectomy, but not adrenalectomy, partially counteracted this effect of ACTH1-10 administration. Besides, simultaneous injection of ACTh1-10 plus melatonin reverses the effects of pinealectomy, resulting in an additive effect of both compounds on Bmax. The response obtained when using ACTh4-10 was somewhat different, because no dose response was obtained in any experiment. Although lack of endogenous melatonin partially reduced the increasing effect of ACTH4-10 on Bmax, there were no additive effects at the different doses used. The results strongly suggest that ACTH-like peptides, in addition to melatonin, play a role in regulating central-type rat BNZ receptors.", 
    "65": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized predominantly by augmented neuronal inhibition and probably neuronal damage. Several theories concerning the pathogenesis of HE have been proposed; none of these theories is necessarily exclusive. Furthermore, the validity of none of them has been definitively proved experimentally. In this review article an important role of endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the pathogenesis of HE is suggested. The involvement of endotoxin and TNF in the pathogenesis of HE seems to be very convincing; it may explain many of the derangements seen in HE. It also seems to be in strong relation to the main theories about HE, the ammonia theory, the GABAergic theory, the benzodiazepine theory, and the AAA/false neurotransmitter theory, where these theories may represent some of the mechanisms whereby TNF may cause inhibition and damage to the CNS in HE, or may represent accompanying features to elevated levels of endotoxin and TNF, with no important role in the pathogenesis of HE. The possible involvement of endotoxin and TNF in the pathogenesis of HE may possess an important clinical application, for serum LPS and TNF concentrations may be of important diagnostic and prognostic value in HE, and treatment with antibodies against endotoxin and against TNF may have potentially beneficial therapeutic effects in this serious and potentially fatal disease.",

    "67": "Antidepressants do not only lead to a decrease of depression, they also reduce the frequency of suicidal ideations. Due to insufficient data and contradictory findings it is not possible to determine clearly whether certain antidepressants are more effective in reducing suicidality than others. Nevertheless, there are some findings on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which support this hypothesis (Baldwin et al., 1991; M\u00f6ller, 1992). The hypothesis that antidepressants with a certain mode of action might evoke suicidality in depressive patients under certain circumstances, has not been corrobarated by data derived from controlled studies (Mann u. Kapur, 1991; Derby et al., 1992). The general hypothesis based on clinical experience that non-sedating or activating antidepressants are possibly problematical in depressive suicidal patients, should nevertheless be kept in mind for safety's sake. In rare cases antidepressants like other psychopharmacological drugs, such as benzodiazepines, can evoke aggressive/autoaggressive behaviour.", 
    "68": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) has a unique pharmacological profile as a \"brain-gut peptide hormone\", and recent development of specific non-peptide antagonists prompted us to investigate the role of the receptors of this peptide in nervous control mechanisms of gastric acid secretion. CCK-8 induced a distinctive acid secretory response after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration, as well as after intravenous infusion in the perfused stomach preparation in rats. L364718, a CCKB-receptor antagonist, had an inhibitory effect against CCK-8 when applied i.c.v., while L365260, a CCKB-receptor antagonist, had no influence, suggesting the apparent dominant control of CCKA receptors in the central nervous system on gastric acid secretion. However, L364718 caused remarkable potentiation in the acid secretory response to the intravenous CCK-8 infusion, and L365260 significantly inhibited the CCK-8-stimulated acid secretion. The potentiation of the acid secretory response to CCK-8 by the CCKA antagonist was completely blocked by vagotomy or atropine, as well as hexamethonium. Thus it was suggested that a vagal control mechanism was involved in the potentiation. Denervation of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent nerve by repeated capsaicin injection also decreased the potentiated response to CCKA antagonist. This seems to suggest the involvement of the vago-vagal reflex in the control of gastric acid secretion by endogenous CCK. Ketanserin, a serotonin 5-HT2/1C-receptor antagonist, showed a distinctive inhibition of acid secretion induced by CCK-8 (i.c.v.), suggesting the involvement of serotonergic control of acid secretion in the CCK-8 action. Current developments in the research in this field were briefly reviewed in relation to our findings.", 
    "69": "A randomized, double-blind study was undertaken to determine the dose requirements, recovery characteristics, and pharmacokinetic variables of midazolam given by continuous infusion for sedation in patients following abdominal aortic surgery. Thirty subjects, 50-75 yr, scheduled to undergo aortic reconstructive surgery, entered the study. Following a nitrous oxide-isoflurane-opioid anaesthetic technique, patients were randomly allocated to receive one of three loading doses (0.03, 0.06 or 0.1 mg.kg-1) and initial infusion rates (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) of midazolam, corresponding to groups low (L), moderate (M) and high (H). The infusion of midazolam was adjusted to maintain sedation levels of \"3, 4 or 5,\" which permitted eye opening in response to either verbal command or a light shoulder tap, using a seven-point scale ranging from \"0\" (awake, agitated) to \"6\" (asleep, non-responsive). Additionally morphine was given in increments of 2.0 mg iv prn for analgesia. On the morning after surgery, midazolam was discontinued, and the tracheas were extubated when patients were awake. Blood samples were taken during, and at increasing intervals for 48 hr following discontinuation of the infusion, and analyzed by gas chromatography. The desired level of sedation was maintained during more than 94% of the infusion period in all three groups, with a maximum of three dose adjustments per patient, for treatment which lasted 16.3 +/- 0.6 hr. There was, however, an increase in both the infusion rates and mean plasma concentrations from Group L to Group H (P < 0.05), which corresponded to an inverse relationship of morphine requirements during the period of sedation (P < 0.05, Group H vs Group L). Optimal midazolam infusion rates and resulting plasma concentrations at the times the infusions were discontinued (in parentheses) were as follows-Group L: 0.60 +/- 0.18 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (76 +/- 32 ng.mL-1), Group M: 0.90 +/- 0.52 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (133 +/- 71 ng.mL-1), and Group H: 1.34 +/- 0.69 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (206 +/- 106 ng.mL-1).

    "71": "Sixty patients with stones in the pelvicalyceal system of the kidney were randomized prospectively to undergo lithotripsy with the Dornier MPL9000 lithotripter (Dormier Medical Systems, Marietta, GA, USA) after receiving either diclofenac 100 mg per rectum (n = 30) or pethidine 50 mg intravenously (n = 30) for analgesia. The patients completed a detailed questionnaire prior to treatment, and the level of pain perceived during lithotripsy was monitored using visual analogue scales (VASs). Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was monitored before analgesia was given, throughout the treatment and for 30 min after cessation of treatment.", 
    "72": "The VASs were available for 56 patients and the results of pulse oximetry for 51 patients. Although a higher kilovoltage was recorded in the group who received pethidine this difference was not significant. Patients who received diclofenac or pethidine alone, showed a non-significant fall of SaO2 30 minutes after the end of treatment, although the largest fall in SaO2 observed with pethidine was 10%. Patients who received diclofenac and pethidine similarly showed a non-significant fall in SaO2. Four patients received intravenous benzodiazepines in addition to pethidine, and in this group there was a dramatic fall in SaO2 which persisted more than 30 min after the end of treatment (P < 0.0027). Diclofenac provided effective analgesia for most of the patients who underwent lithotripsy. Overall 11 patients (18%) required additional analgesia. Diclofenac or pethidine alone, in the doses used in this study, did not cause a significant drop in SaO2 during ESWL. The only response found to be of value in predicting a painful experience was fear of the dentist.", 
    "73": "This study shows that modern lithotripsy, in addition to being safe and effective, can be performed as an out-patient procedure using simple non-opiate analgesics. The need for stronger analgesia and/or sedation should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient, although it remains difficult to predict which patients will require such measures.", 
    "74": "Endogenous dopamine release in the retina of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) increases in light and decreases in darkness. The roles of the inhibitory amino acid transmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine in regulating this light/dark difference in dopamine release were explored in the present study. Exogenous GABA, the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol, the GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen, and the GABA-C receptor agonist cis-aminocrotonic acid (CACA) suppressed light-evoked dopamine overflow from eyecups. The effects of GABA-A and -B receptor agonists were selectively reversed by their respective receptor-specific antagonists, whereas the effect of CACA was reversed by the competitive GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline. The benzodiazepine diazepam enhanced the effect of muscimol on light-evoked dopamine release. Both GABA-A and -B receptor antagonists stimulated dopamine release in light or darkness. Bicuculline was more potent in light than in darkness. These data suggest that retinal dopaminergic neurons are inhibited by GABA-A and -B receptor activation in both light and darkness but that GABA-mediated inhibitory tone may be greater in darkness than in light. Exogenous glycine inhibited light-stimulated dopamine release in a concentration-dependent and strychnine-sensitive manner. However, strychnine alone did not increase dopamine release in light or darkness, nor did it augment bicuculline-stimulated release in darkness. Additionally, both strychnine and 7-chlorokynurenate, an antagonist of the strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor, suppressed light-evoked dopamine release. Thus, the role of endogenous glycine in the regulation of dopamine release remains unclear.", 
    "75": "We have studied the effects of midazolam and flumazenil on the carotid sinus baroreflex, by examining mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) responses to partial or complete bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) in 12 conscious rabbits after aortic denervation. In eight rabbits, the responses to complete BCO were evaluated before and after cumulative doses of midazolam 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1, and after flumazenil 0.3 mg kg-1 following administration of midazolam. Midazolam and flumazenil had no effect on MAP or HR before complete BCO and neither affected the MAP response to complete BCO. Midazolam 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1 decreased the HR response to 60% and 58% of control, respectively. Flumazenil restored the midazolam-induced depression of the HR response to the control level. In the other four rabbits, we examined the MAP and HR responses to partial BCO (carotid artery pressure reduced by 5, 10 and 20 mm Hg) before and after midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1 and after flumazenil 0.3 mg kg-1 following administration of midazolam. The response to partial occlusion showed the same tendency as the response to complete BCO. These results indicate that midazolam attenuated the HR response of the carotid sinus baroreflex, flumazenil restored this midazolam-induced depression and neither drug affected the MAP response.", 
    "76": "We have measured the skin conductance response under resting conditions and to innocuous auditory stimuli in 45 patients receiving midazolam (group M), propofol (group P) or no sedative drug (group ND) before minor hand surgery under local anaesthesia. Administration of the sedative drugs was titrated to the end-point of slurring of speech and ptosis. The mean dose of midazolam was 0.06 (SD 0.01) mg kg-1 and the mean infusion rate of propofol was 2.2 (0.39) mg kg-1 h-1. Subjective ratings of anxiety and sedation were measured using visual analogue scales. These were similar in groups M and P and significantly different from those reported by group ND (P = 0.001-0.005). However, measures of skin conductance in group M were significantly lower than in group P (P = 0.002-0.013) and group ND (P = 0.004-0.016). These measures were similar in groups P and ND. Skin conductance measures were related significantly to anxiety scores only in groups M and ND (P < 0.05). We conclude that skin conductance is not a non-specific index of sedative-anxiolytic action and therefore is not useful in comparative studies of anxiolytic drugs that exert their effects by different pharmacological mechanisms.", 
    "77": "Forty Danish panic disorder patients participating in a placebo controlled study of alprazolam and imipramine (The Cross National Collaborative Panic Study, Phase II) were followed up by a telephone interview three years later, with essentially the same battery of evaluation procedures applied at baseline, end of study, and follow-up. The main finding was that panic disorder is a chronic disorder, but fluctuating in form and severity in the course of time. Twenty-five percent of the patients no longer fulfilled the DSM-III criteria for panic disorder, but had substantial disability due to a variety of symptoms, including panic attacks at infrequent rate, generalized anxiety symptoms, affective symptoms, and phobic avoidance behavior. Nearly three fourths of the patients were under treatment at follow-up. Benzodiazepines were the drugs most often prescribed, usually in combination with supportive psychotherapy. It was concluded that the different types of treatment offered were insufficient. Variables predicting panic disorder or substantial disability at 3-years follow-up were few.", 
    "78": "Whole-cell and patch-voltage clamp experiments were carried out on cultured chick spinal cord neurons to investigate the dependence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor function on intracellular phosphorylation factors. Without ATP in the intracellular solution, repeated application of 30 microM GABA results in a progressive decline (run-down) of the currents evoked by GABA in standard whole-cell recordings but not when the nystatin-perforated patch method is used. Run-down is also observed in outside-out excised patch recordings, indicating that any enzymatic factors required for run-down must be closely associated with the plasma membrane. Run-down is associated with decreases in both the maximum GABA-induced current and the GABA EC50. Inclusion of magnesium adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate in the intracellular buffer prevents the decline in the maximum GABA response but the GABA EC50 still decreases, resulting in a \"run-up\" of the response at low (3 microM) GABA concentrations. Run-down is use dependent, requiring repeated activation of the GABAA receptor by high (30 microM) GABA concentrations. However, use-independent run-down can be induced by the inclusion of alkaline phosphatase in the intracellular buffer. The response to 3 microM GABA does not normally run down, but run-down is observed when the response to 3 microM GABA is potentiated with pentobarbital or allopregnanolone, suggesting that run-down is consequence of GABA receptor activation and/or desensitization. Run-down of the potentiated GABA response can be prevented by addition of magnesium adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate to the intracellular solution. Strikingly, run-down results in a significant decrease in the potentiating effects of positive modulators, whereas the inhibitory effects of negative modulators such as pregnenolone sulfate and ZnCl2 are unchanged. The results demonstrate that phosphorylation factors have the capacity to control GABAA receptor pharmacology, affecting the potency and efficacy of GABA, the kinetics of GABAA receptor desensitization, and the sensitivity of the receptor to modulators such as steroids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates.", 
    "79": "Intrathecal injection of neostigmine enhances antinociception from clonidine while it counteracts clonidine-induced hypotension. This study further examined the pharmacology of neostigmine-clonidine interactions in the spinal cord and focused on the roles of muscarinic receptor subtypes and local nitric oxide synthesis. Spinal neostigmine counteracted clonidine-induced decreases in blood pressure and heart rate in conscious sheep and this effect was blocked by spinal injection of the M2 muscarinic antagonist, AFDX-116, but not by the M1 muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine. Carbamylcholine injected spinally alone increased blood pressure and heart rate and these effects and neostigmine's hemodynamic interaction with clonidine were blocked by spinal injection of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-methyl-L-arginine. The authors also investigated antinociceptive interactions by using a mechanical pressure stimulus on the forelimb of conscious sheep. Spinal clonidine produced dose-dependent antinociception, which was enhanced by neostigmine and antagonized by N-methyl-L-arginine. NADPH diaphorase staining of sheep spinal cord revealed dense localization to the superficial dorsal horn and the intermediolateral cell column. These results suggest that counteraction of spinal clonidine-induced hypotension by neostigmine is due to stimulation of spinal M2 muscarinic receptors and synthesis of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide synthesis is also necessary for clonidine-induced antinociception in sheep.", 
    "80": "Long-term treatment of rats with full (triazolam) or selective (diazepam) allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors rapidly induced tolerance to the protective effect of these drugs against bicuculline-induced convulsion. In contrast, long-term administration of partial allosteric modulators (imidazenil and bretazenil) of GABAA receptors, in doses equipotent to those of diazepam and triazolam that induce anticonvulsant tolerance, failed to elicit such a tolerance. Furthermore, no cross-tolerance was observed between diazepam and imidazenil. Discontinuation of long-term treatment with diazepam or triazolam, but not of long-term treatment with imidazenil or bretazenil, sensitized rats to behavioral inhibition by punishment (electric shock) in a manner that was potentiated by flumazenil. Administration of a single oral dose of [14C]diazepam or [3H] imidazenil to rats treated repeatedly with the corresponding unlabeled drug or vehicle revealed that the brain concentrations of drugs and their metabolites were similar in both groups of animals. This suggests that tolerance to the full or selective allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors may be associated with changes in the efficacy of the allosteric modulation rather than with changes in drug metabolism. Imidazenil has a longer half-life than an equipotent dose of diazepam and protects rats against bicuculline-induced convulsions for a significantly longer time than diazepam or bretazenil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Oral YM022 (0.1-10 mumol/kg), famotidine (0.3-30 mumol/kg) and omeprazole (3-100 mumol/kg) dose-dependently suppressed acid secretion in pylorusligated rats with ED50 values of 0.83, 1.63 and 10.9 mumol/kg, respectively. YM022 (1-10 mumol/kg p.o.), famotidine (1-10 mumol/kg p.o.) and omeprazole (10-100 mumol/kg p.o.) prevented indomethacin-induced gastric lesions in a dose-related manner. The potency of YM022 was comparable to that of famotidine and was 8 times greater than that of omeprazole. YM022 and famotidine partially inhibited gastric damage induced by water-immersion and restraint stress, whereas omeprazole abolished these lesions. In an acidified ethanol-induced gastric injury model, all three drugs inhibited the formation of erosions. The YM022 dosage required in this model was much greater than that required in the inhibition of gastric acid. The inhibitory effect of YM022 was partially reversed by indomethacin, indicating the involvement of a prostaglandin-mediated pathway. YM022 (3-100 mumol/kg p.o.), famotidine (1-30 mumol/kg p.o.) and omeprazole (3-100 mumol/kg p.o.) inhibited mepirizole-induced duodenal ulcers. On the basis of ED50 values, YM022 was 5 times less potent than famotidine and as potent as omeprazole against mepirizole-induced duodenal ulcers. These results suggest that YM022 possesses antisecretory and antiulcer activities that are as potent as those of famotidine in rats and that YM022 represents a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease.", 
    "82": "Certain neurosteroids rapidly alter the excitability of neurons, in part by potentiating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-evoked chloride currents, and, like other GABA potentiating drugs, may have anticonvulsant activity. We compared the abilities of a series of isomeric metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone (3-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones and 3-hydroxy pregnane-21-ol-20-ones) to enhance GABA-evoked chloride currents in cultured hippocampal neurons with their abilities to protect against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice. Metabolites with 3-hydroxy in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configuration were highly effective at potentiating GABA-evoked chloride current and also showed potent anticonvulsant activity in the PTZ seizure test. The corresponding metabolites with hydroxyl groups in the 3 beta-position were considerably less potent in enhancing GABA responses and were inactive in the PTZ test. All of the neurosteroids failed to protect against tonic hindlimb extension in the maximal electroshock seizure test. 5 alpha-Pregnane-3 alpha,11 beta,21-triol-20-one, a corticosterone metabolite reported to block voltage-dependent Ca++ channels, was inactive in either of the anticonvulsant tests. At higher doses, neurosteroids effective in the PTZ test also produced motor impairment. Relative motor toxicity was lower (higher protective index) for compounds with the 5 alpha-configuration than for their corresponding 5 beta-epimers. The anticonvulsant profile of the neurosteroids resembled that of the benzodiazepine clonazepam. Although the anticonvulsant steroids had greater in vitro potencies than clonazepam, they were less potent in vivo, and they had lower protective indices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The selective influence of SSRIs on serotonin neurotransmission has resulted in a specific constellation of adverse effects termed \"jitteriness\" syndrome, which occurs in at least 30% of patients taking SSRIs. Because there have been no systematic studies examining treatment of SSRI-induced jitteriness, we conducted a prospective study of the efficacy of adjunctive alprazolam therapy for fluoxetine-induced jitteriness symptoms.",

    "87": "The antiepileptic effect of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl GABA, VGB) in children has been demonstrated in controlled and open studies. According to the literature, results were good to excellent in partial seizures (with and without becoming secondarily generalized) and promising in infantile spasms (IS). In patients with myoclonic epilepsies of early childhood and especially those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), the effect of VGB has been investigated only to a limited extent and the pattern of response was variable. The present open, add-on, dose-ranging study was initiated to assess the long-term effect and safety of VGB in a cohort of 20 children with LGS who were not responding sufficiently to first-line drug monotherapy with valproate (VPA) instead of adding classical second-line antiepileptic drugs [AEDs: benzodiazepines (BZD), phenobarbital (PB), primidone (PRM)], which usually are associated with rapid diminution of their antiepileptic properties and a high frequency of side effects. Eighty-five percent of children experienced a 50-100% reduction in seizure frequency, even after dose reduction of VPA. No serious side effects occurred except in 1 patient who experienced dyskinesia. Mood changes, sedation, ataxia, and hypersalivation, well-known complications of other AEDs, were not observed.",

    "89": "In 3 children with \"epilepsy with electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep\" (ESES), we estimated interhemispheric small time differences (TDs) during spike-wave activity in EEG by coherence and phase analysis by the two-dimensional autoregressive model to differentiate their continuous diffuse spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) between primary bilateral synchrony and secondary bilateral synchrony (SBS). Maximal TDs at onset of apparently bilateral synchronous spike-wave bursts (BSSWs) during slow-wave sleep were 12.0-26.5 ms (mean 20.3 ms) with consistent leading hemispheres in eight bursts of the 3 patients, indicating SBS as pathophysiology of their CSWS. This suggestion was supported by their clinico-EEG findings, including the effect of a single oral dose of clobazam (CLB) on EEG. Three ictal BSSWs of atypical absence seizures in 2 patients were also analyzed to obtain maximal TDs of 17.9-41.7 ms (mean 26.3 ms) at onset, with the same leading sides as in sleep, also indicating SBS. Examination of intraburst TD variations showed no consistent disappearance of TDs during the latter part of the bursts, in either sleep or the ictal EEGs of atypical absences, and a role of the corpus callosum was suggested in the generation of SBS in ESES.", 
    "90": "Benzodiazepines used intra-operatively can occasionally cause prolonged sedation. Flumazenil (Romazicon) is an imidazobenzodiazepine that functions as a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. This clinical investigation was designed to evaluate the efficacy and of intravenous flumazenil in reversing the central effects of midazolam after a general anesthetic using midazolam for maintenance. 30 ASA I-III inpatients entered and completed this study. All were interviewed preoperatively and baseline performance on a battery of psychomotor tests was obtained. Parameters measured included an assessment of sleep status, vital signs, responsiveness to verbal stimuli, quality of speech, facial expression, eye coordination, recognition of a picture card, finger-finger-to-nose (FFN) coordination and overall discharge readiness. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam. Midazolam and fentanyl were the primary maintenance agents combined with N2O and O2 (70:30) and a limited concentration of isoflurane. In the recovery room the test drug was administered in a double-blinded, randomized manner. 20 patients received flumazenil (F), the rest placebo (P).

    "91": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of both acute and chronic liver disease. Several hypotheses have emerged following the development of appropriate animal models of HE and following studies using postmortem brain tissue from HE patients. It was originally suggested that primary energy failure was responsible for HE; however, there is now mounting evidence that the pathogenetic defect involves neurotransmission failure. Specific neurotransmitter systems implicated in the pathogenesis of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) include the excitatory amino acid glutamate as well as neuroactive and/or neurotoxic biogenic amine metabolites. Although it has been proposed that alterations in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system may play a pathogenic role in HE associated with both chronic and acute liver failure, there is now overwhelming evidence to the contrary. On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that a subgroup of patients with HE have increased blood and CSF concentrations of substances that bind to GABA-related benzodiazepine receptors in brain. Alterations of both the glutamatergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems in PSE likely result from the metabolic consequences of chronic exposure of brain to toxic levels of ammonia. In addition to its effects on glutamatergic and serotoninergic systems during chronic liver disease, ammonia has been intimately associated with the brain edema invariably observed in acute liver failure. It is evident that, regardless of the type of liver failure, effective reductions of ammonia levels remains the strategy of choice in the prevention of encephalopathy. The further elucidation of neurotransmitter alterations in HE could result in novel \"downstream\" neuropharmacologic approaches to its prevention and treatment.",

Data from clinical trials show a comparable effectiveness in inducing and maintaining sleep to comparative drugs (benzodiazepines) and besides that, it seems to preserve--even improve sleep-architecture and lastly preserve daytime wakefulness. Very few studies have been conducted in psychiatric patients, but also in this group effectiveness has been shown, and from daily clinical experience, this picture seems to hold. It must be remembered, that psychiatric patients have a high level of symptomatic benzodiazepine and/or alcohol misuse disposing to withdrawal and abstinence states in which zolpidem is less effective presumedly reflecting its selectivity. Having passed the withdrawal states, zolpidem can be used as an effective and safe hypnotic.",

Of the imidazopyridines alpidem showed an anxiolytic activity, while after zolpidem only a sedative activity was seen. No tolerance to the anxiolytic and sedative activity of the evaluated imidazopyridines could be detected. On the other hand tolerance appeared in the conditioned avoidance response test (evaluating learning and memory).",

It is concluded that both postsynaptic inhibition of the temporal lobe function (the hippocampus), and attenuation of the cell body firing of the raphe neurons appears to be important elements of anti-anxiety action of benzodiazepines and 5-HT1A receptor antagonists.

Brain sections were processed using film autoradiography to visualize in the hippocampus either total muscarinic receptor binding ([3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate; [3H]QNB), or M1 receptors ([3H]pirenzepine; [3H]PZ), or M2 receptors ([3H]oxotremorine-M; [3H]OXO-M). A reduction in [3H]QNB binding was found in CA1 and CA3c 7 d after TMT, but not in CA3a, b, or the dentate gyrus. [3H]PZ binding was decreased throughout Ammon's horn by 14 d after treatment. [3H]OXO-M binding decreased 1 d after exposure in CA1 and in all subfields of Ammon's horn by d 3. Neither [3H]PZ or [3H]OXO-M binding decreased in the dentate gyrus of TMT-treated rat at any time point. The temporal patterns of receptor loss may be explicable by reference to timing of fiber and cell body degeneration reported in previous studies and the regional differences may account for discrepancies between reports of either substantial decreases or no loss in hippocampal muscarinic receptors after TMT exposure.", 
    "97": "The acquisition of discrete shuttle avoidance of mouse was significantly impaired by presentation of 120 pairs of a tone signal and an unavoidable/unescapable shock at 30 sec intervals for 3 consecutive days prior to the training session.

Ethanol (0.8-2.4 g/kg p.o.), nicotine (0.1-1 mg/kg s.c.), methamphetamine (0.1-1 mg/kg s.c.) and morphine (1-10 mg/kg s.c.) did not modify the avoidance acquisition.

    "98": "The effects of alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, on hormonal and behavioral responses induced by meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (MCPP), a serotonin receptor agonist, were investigated in 10 healthy men. Alprazolam (0.5 mg) or placebo was given 1 hour before MCPP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone (GH) release, MCPP and alprazolam plasma levels, anxiety level, and panic symptoms were measured over 210 minutes. MCPP was found to increase cortisol, prolactin, GH, and anxiety levels. Alprazolam decreased cortisol and GH levels but had no effect on prolactin. When used in combination with MCPP, alprazolam blunted MCPP-induced cortisol and GH release, and it blocked the anxiogenic effects of MCPP.", 
    "99": "The aim of this study was to determine, in the rat, the interaction between melatonin and cholecystokinin in the regulation of the ileal interdigestive motility. This was analyzed by the chronic electromyography technique. Ileal motility was defined by the presence of intermittent spike bursts corresponding to the contractile activity of the organ. In control rats, these spike bursts were organized in cyclic myoelectrical complexes. Each complex is characterized by two successive spiking activity phases: the irregular phase (ISA) followed by the regular phase (RSA). Pinealectomy suppressed the RSA phase so ileal motility was constituted only by the ISA phase. When melatonin (1 mg/kg i.v.) was injected into pinealectomized rats, RSA phases were immediately and definitively restored. RSA phases were also re-established when the \"alimentary\" type of cholecystokinin receptors (CCKA) were blocked by selective antagonists such as L364,718 or SR27897 (1 mg/kg i.v.). The latter had better brain accessibility than L364,718. Unlike the effects of melatonin, the effect of these antagonists was neither immediate (the latency is longer for L364,718 than for SR27897) nor definitive. In control rats, cholecystokinin (5 micrograms/kg i.v.) induced a characteristic long-lasting (29 +/- 2 min) excitomotor effect on the ileum. This effect was suppressed in pinealectomized rats and was restored after melatonin treatment. These results suggest that, via the central nervous system, melatonin is involved in the modulation of cholecystokinin action on ileal motility.", 
    "100": "The elevated \"zero-maze\" is a modification of the elevated plus-maze model of anxiety in rats which incorporates both traditional and novel ethological measures in the analysis of drug effects. The novel design comprises an elevated annular platform with two opposite enclosed quadrants and two open, removing any ambiguity in interpretation of time spent on the central square of the traditional design and allowing uninterrupted exploration. Using this model, the reference benzodiazepine anxiolytics, diazepam (0.125-0.5 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) significantly increased the percentage of time spent in the open quadrants (% TO) and the frequency of head dips over the edge of the platform (HDIPS), and reduced the frequency of stretched attend postures (SAP) from the closed to open quadrants. In contrast, the anxiogenic drug m-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP; 0.25-1.0 mg/kg) induced the opposite effects, decreasing %TO and HDIPS, and increasing SAP. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.001-0.1 mg/kg) had no effects on either %TO or HDIPS, but did decrease SAP at 0.01 mg/kg although not at higher or lower doses. Similarly, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron (0.0001-1.0 mg/kg) decreased SAP and increased %TO at 0.01 mg/kg, but not at other doses. The present data suggest that a combination of the novel \"zero-maze\" design and a detailed ethological analysis provides a sensitive model for the detection of anxiolytic/anxiogenic drug action.", 
    "101": "We investigated the effects of the long-term administration of Kamikihito (KKT) on the specific binding of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam in the brains of young and aged rats using in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Specific [3H]muscimol binding in aged rats was decreased in all brain regions examined compared with that in young rats, whereas [3H]flunitrazepam binding did not change in any of the brain regions. Scatchard analysis revealed that the maximal number of [3H]muscimol binding sites in the cortex and thalamus was significantly decreased in aged rats compared with young rats, while its affinity remained unchanged. Long-term administration of KKT in young rats had no effect on either [3H]muscimol or [3H]flunitrazepam binding. In contrast, the same treatment in aged rats produced a significant increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the cortex, caudate/putamen and accumbens, and it tended to decrease the [3H]muscimol binding. These results suggest that the selective reduction of specific [3H]muscimol binding in the brain may be responsible, at least in part, for anxiety-related behavior in aged rats. Furthermore, it appears that the significant increase in specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding produced in the brains of aged rats by the long-term administration of KKT may be responsible for the anxiolytic effects of this agent.", 
    "102": "We studied the effects of marmin and nobiletin on the experimental acute gastric lesions, gastric transmucosal potential difference (PD) and gastric motor activity in rats and the contractions of isolated guinea pig ileum. Oral administration of marmin and nobiletin inhibited both the appearance of ethanol-induced gastric hemorrhagic lesions dose-dependently in a dose range of 10-50 mg/kg, with ED50 values for marmin and nobiletin being 17.2 and 8.0 mg/kg, respectively. However, marmin and nobiletin had minimal effects on aspirin-induced gastric lesions at a dose of 50 mg/kg, respectively. Marmin and nobiletin had no significant influence on the basal PD. Intragastrical administration of marmin and nobiletin at a dose of 25 mg/kg significantly prevented the PD reduction induced by ethanol. Both marmin and nobiletin given intragastrically at 25 mg/kg significantly inhibited gastric motor activity measured as intraluminal pressure recordings. Marmin and nobiletin exhibited concentration-dependent relaxations of contractions induced by acetylcholine, transmural electrical stimulation and histamine in isolated guinea pig ileum, respectively. These findings suggest that the anti-ulcer effects of marmin and nobiletin are ascribed primarily to the maintenance of the mucosal barrier integrity and inhibition of gastric motor activity and secondarily due to the prevention of the effects of endogenous acetylcholine and histamine.", 
    "103": "During a five year period (1988-1992) 70 cases of seizures were collected by the Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Center of Clermont-Ferrand (3.58% of total collected cases). 31 cases (22 M and 9 F) occurred after a drug withdrawal. Benzodiazepines--either alone or in association--were the most often involved. Mean age was 48.8 +/- 2.6 years in this group and additional factors (alcohol abuse and/or association of drugs that lower the seizure threshold) were associated in 26 cases. 39 cases (14 M and 25 F) occurred on the course of various treatments. The most frequently involved drugs were neuropsychiatric, antiinfectious (especially beta-lactam antibiotics, fluorquinolones and isoniazid) and theophylline. Mean age was 56.5 +/- 3.8 years and additional different factors (high dosages, antecedents of epilepsy, underlying diseases) were present in 22 observations.",

    "106": "A total of 563 patients had interscalene anesthesia, exclusively, and 117 had general anesthesia. Mepivacaine, 1.4% with 1/200,000 epinephrine, was the most frequently used agent (480). Others included 0.5% bupivacaine (33) and 0.625% bupivacaine (50). Of 563 interscalene blocks attempted, 34 required general anesthesia to either initiate or complete the surgery (success rate, 94.1%) with 20 in the 0.5% bupivacaine group, 10 in the mepivacaine group, and 9 in the 0.65% bupivacaine group. For blood loss calculations, failed interscalene blocks were included with the general anesthesia group. Three surgical procedures were identified: total shoulder arthroplasty, acromioplasty with and without repair of the rotator cuff, and capsular advancement for recurrent shoulder dislocation. Comparing general and interscalene anesthesia, blood loss was less in the overall group and in the acromioplasty-rotator cuff group when interscalene block was compared to general anesthesia. There were four complications with two seizures and two subdural injections.",

    "108": "The effects of diazepam (DZP) on mitosis and the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton in the live diatoms Hantzschia amphioxys and Surirella robusta were followed using time-lapse video microscopy. Similarly treated cells were fixed and later examined for immunoflouresence staining of MTs or for transmission electron microscopy. DZP treatment (250 microM) had no effect on interphase cells but affected mitosis, resulting in the majority of prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes releasing from one or both spindle poles and collecting irregularly along the central spindle. Chromosomes remaining attached to one pole continued to display slight prometaphase oscillations; however, this activity was never observed in metaphase spindles. Following removal of DZP, some chromosomes still bipolarly attached, immediately released elastically from one pole. Within the first 2 minutes of recovery, all chromosomes recommenced spindle attachment, exhibiting normal prometaphase oscillations and proceeded through mitosis. DZP treatment during anaphase had no detectable effect on chromosome motion or cell cleavage. These results suggest that DZP acts as an anti-MT agent, selectively affecting polar MTs at prophase, prometaphase and metaphase, and thereby weakening kinetochore connection to the poles. From these and other results (unpublished), its mode of action is different to that of most anti-MT agents.", 
    "109": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to measure the densities of binding sites for the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor ligand 3H-PK11195 in regions of the rat brain 1, 3, 7 and 28 days following portacaval anastomosis (PCA) and in sham-operated control animals. The results demonstrate that densities of 3H-PK11195 binding sites were significantly increased in the cerebral cortex (by 40%, p < 0.05) as early as 24 hours following PCA. In the thalamus significant increases in densities of 3H-PK11195 binding sites were seen 3 days after PCA, whereas in brain regions such as the striatum and cerebellum, significant increases in 3H-PK11195 binding sites were not evident until 7 days following PCA. By 28 days following PCA increased densities of 3H-PK11195 binding sites were well established and widespread throughout the brain. Previous studies demonstrate early increases of brain ammonia following PCA. PTBRs or their endogenous ligands could play an important role in the early astrocytic response (mitochondrial proliferation, swelling) to ammonia following PCA.", 
    "110": "Current evidence suggests that the cerebral vasculature may be modulated by cholinergic nerves. We used ligand binding methods to examine the presence of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in brain vasculature. We found carbachol-displaceable [3H]acetylcholine (ACh) and [3H]nicotine (NIC) binding sites in preparations of intraparenchymal cerebral microvessels (CMV) and larger pial vessels from human and pig brains. Specific binding sites for [3H]ACh and [3H]NIC in cerebral microvessels were saturable and comparable in density to those in cerebral cortex. The Kds for the two ligands ranged 3-18 nM whereas the Bmaxs were 25-45 fmol/mg protein. In contrast, the binding of [3H]pirenzipine or [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, index for muscarinic receptors, was low (9-15% of cortex) in microvessels compared to the cerebral cortex. Our observations suggest the association of cholinergic nicotinic receptors with cerebral microvessels, which may be involved in the modulation of the cerebral circulation by cholinergic neurons.", 
    "111": "1. Electrically evoked contractions in isolated strips of rat gastric fundus were inhibited by atropine (IC50 = 2.5 x 10(-9) M), pirenzepine (IC50 = 2.3 x 10(-8) M), clonidine (IC50 = 3.9 x 10(-8) M) and morphine (IC50 = 3.2 x 10(-7) M) in a dose-dependent manner. 2. The inhibitory effect of morphine was antagonized by naloxone (10(-6) M). The inhibitory effect of clonidine not only was not reversed by yohimbine but also was enhanced. Yohimbine per se inhibited these contractions (IC50 = 6.4 x 10(-6) M). 3. In presence of atropine (2 x 10(-6) M) and guanethidine (5 x 10(-6) M), electrical stimulation of isolated strips of rat gastric fundus produced a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory response. 4. The NANC inhibitory response was decreased by morphine (10(-8)-3 x 10(-6) M). In addition, morphine decreased the tone of the muscle. These effects of morphine was antagonized by naloxone (3 x 10(-6) M). 5. Clonidine up to 10(-6) M had no influence on the NANC inhibitory response but yohimbine per se (10(-7)-3 x 10(-5) M) blocked it (IC50 = 3 x 10(-6) M). 6. These findings indicate that electrically evoked contractions in the rat gastric fundus were mediated by muscarinic receptors. In addition, the NANC inhibitory response in the isolated 5-strips of rat gastric fundus was blocked by morphine and yohimbine.",

This study was designed to characterize the absorption and disposition of the drug and its active metabolites in rats, dogs, and rhesus monkeys. Following intravenous administration (5 mg/kg), L-663,581 was cleared rapidly in all species. The plasma clearance was approximately 95, 40, and 48 ml/min/kg for rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively. Comparison of urinary recoveries of radioactivity after oral and intravenous dosing indicated that approximately 80-90% of the dose was absorbed in rats and dogs, and 50% in monkeys. The bioavailability was approximately 45% in dogs, 23% in rats, and very low in monkeys after oral administration (5 mg/kg), suggesting an extensive first-pass metabolism in all species. HPLC radiohistograms of urine from all species after intravenous administration revealed that only a trace amount of intact drug was present, indicating that the drug was mainly eliminated by biotransformation. NMR and mass spectral analyses showed that hydroxylation is a major biotransformation pathway. Two active metabolites have been identified as mono- and bis-hydroxy analogs. In addition, the disposition of the monohydroxylated metabolite was also studied in these species. Elimination of the metabolite from plasma was much slower than that of the parent drug in all species. Systemic conversion of L-663,581 to the monohydroxylated metabolite was approximately 43% in rats, 52% in dogs, and only 11% in monkeys.", 
    "113": "Physically and neurologically handicapped pediatric dental patients are often a challenge to treat and may require the use of pharmacological agents for behavior modification. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety, in terms of vital sign changes and complications, and the effectiveness, in terms of behavioral changes, of two dosages of oral midazolam as a conscious sedative agent for this unique population. Participating in this study were 31 patients of Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, who were uncooperative (as rated on the Frankl scale) at a previous dental appointment. The patients, 3-18 years old, were randomly selected to receive one of the two dosage regimens; Group A received 0.3 mg/kg oral midazolam and Group B received 0.5 mg/kg. Physiologic parameters and behavior were recorded throughout the appointment and overall safety and success were determined. Although clinically insignificant, Group A's pulse rates 20 min into treatment were significantly higher than at baseline or treatment start, and oxygen saturations were lower during treatment than at baseline and start of treatment. Intratreatment systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rates of Group B were significantly higher than the baseline figures; however, these changes were not clinically significant. No clinical or postoperative complications were noted for either dosage. The regimen of 0.3 mg/kg of oral midazolam was successful 75% of the time, and the regimen of 0.5 mg/kg of oral midazolam was successful 60% of the time in providing adequate sedation to allow operative treatment to be safely and efficiently performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "114": "Archival samples of flurazepam monohydrochloride and \"hydrochloride\" (i.e., the dihydrochloride) were examined by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy to determine evidence of degradation during storage for 13-15 years. No degradation of the three different batches of monohydrochloride salts was detected, but various degrees of degradation of the eight specimens of flurazepam hydrochloride diprotonated salts were indicated by enhanced intensities (IR 1635, 1509, 1226; Raman 1636, 1408, 1149 cm-1) and new features (IR 1742, 943, 755; Raman 1554, 837, 742 cm-1). All of these features, except the 1742 cm-1 IR band, were attributed to the presence of the hydrolysis product 5-chloro-2-[[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]amino]-2'-fluorobenzophenone hydrochloride whereas the 1742 cm-1 band was attributed to glycine hydrochloride, the other hydrolytic moiety. The flurazepam hydrochloride samples were also examined in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide solution by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy to verify the presence of the degradation products and to estimate the levels of degradation (approximately 3-36%) of the drug. IR and Raman spectra of the \"benzophenone\" hydrochloride in the \"fingerprint\" region are compared with two samples of flurazepam dihydrochloride (slightly and highly degraded) and their features discussed. Vibrational assignments are made and discussed for the observed IR and Raman wavenumbers for the \"benzophenone\" hydrochloride.",

    "116": "1. Central effects of the diuretic, bendrofluazide (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. Two placebos and an active control drug, oxazepam (15 mg), were included. Single doses were administered double-blind at 10.00 h. The effects of drugs on performance and subjective feelings were assessed before and from 1.5-2.5 and 3.5-4.5 h after ingestion, and recording of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and body sway carried out. 2. Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, together with critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. The EEG was recorded with eyes open while the subjects carried out a mental arithmetic task, and with eyes closed, when they were required to relax. Body sway was recorded with eyes open and with eyes closed. 3. Bendrofluazide (10 mg) increased the number of errors at letter cancellation and reduced the rate of finger tapping (P < 0.05), while oxazepam increased the number of errors and reduced accuracy at continuous attention (P < 0.01), and increased the number of involuntary rest pauses during tapping (P < 0.05). 4. There were no effects of drugs on subjective assessment of mood. 5. No changes in the electrical activity of the brain were observed with bendrofluazide.

    "117": "The effects of the cyclopyrrolones zopiclone and suriclone on the function of the central gamma-amino-butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex in mouse brain were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Added in vitro to mouse cerebral cortical membranes, these compounds potently inhibited [3H]flumazenil binding with IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values of 35.8 nM (zopiclone) and 1.1 nM (suriclone). Similar results were obtained with cerebellar membranes, indicating that these drugs do not discriminate between putative type I and type II benzodiazepine receptors. The interaction of cyclopyrrolones with recognition sites present at the level of the GABA receptor complex appears to be competitive, because zopiclone decreased the affinity of the receptors for [3H]flumazenil without affecting the maximal number of binding sites. Moreover, zopiclone and suriclone did not affect the rate of dissociation of [3H]flumazenil from benzodiazepine receptors. The in vitro efficacy of zopiclone appeared different from that of suriclone and the benzodiazepines diazepam and flunitrazepam. Thus, zopiclone failed to affect muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and only slightly inhibited t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding. In contrast, like diazepam and flunitrazepam, suriclone increased muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and markedly inhibited [35S]TBPS binding. In contrast, like diazepam and flunitrazepam, suriclone increased muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and markedly inhibited [35S]TBPS binding. On the other hand, suriclone, like zopiclone, did not modify [3H]muscimol binding to mouse cerebral cortical membranes. Moreover, zopiclone antagonized the reduction in [35S]TBPS binding elicited by the benzodiazepine receptor full of agonist diazepam. Consistent with its low efficacy in vitro, oral administration of zopiclone (2.5 to 100 mg/kg, p.o.) in mice failed to modify [35S]TBPS binding subsequently measured in cerebral cortical membranes \"ex vitro\".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "118": "A recognition site for benzodiazepines structurally different from that linked to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A or the \"central type\" benzodiazepine receptor has been located mainly in the outer membranes of mitochondria and designated mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). A putative endogenous ligand for MBR is the peptide, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), which inhibits benzodiazepine ligand binding in mitochondrial membranes. In this study, DBI- and MBR-like immunoreactivities (LI) were examined at the cellular and ultrastructural levels, and their changes during cell growth were followed in rat primary cerebellar astroglial and C-6 cell cultures. During the early stages of the cultures (7-14 days in vitro), MBR and DBI were expressed virtually in all astrocytes and C-6 cells of the cultures. The highest MBR/DBI immunoreactivity was observed in dividing cells. When the astrocytes had formed a confluent layer (21 days in vitro), MBR staining intensity was significantly decreased. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated an even distribution of DBI-LI throughout the cytoplasm, while MBR-LI was mainly observed in a close association with the outer mitochondrial membranes. However, dividing cells also displayed strong MBR immunoreactivity in endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear membranes, and centrioles. Treatment of the confluent cultures with MBR ligands PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 at nanomolar concentrations increased the density of MBR-LI and the progesterone content in the medium 2-3-fold over the basal levels. These results demonstrate a close association between DBI and mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors and lend support to the theory that they have a possible role in the regulation of steroid production. The relation of MBR and DBI expression to cell growth and division suggests a novel role for these elements in the regulation of important intracellular events.", 
    "119": "To explore behavioral selectivity as a consequence of multiple receptor subtypes, four benzodiazepine receptor ligands, flunitrazepam, CGS 9896, zolpidem, and AHR 11797, were tested at five in vivo endpoints: anticonvulsant action, anxiolysis/anxiogenesis as determined in the plus-maze test, locomotor activity, changes in food consumption, and hypothermia. All compounds produced hypothermia. In the plus-maze test, flunitrazepam, CGS 9896, and a low dose of zolpidem (0.05 mg/kg) increased the time spent in the open arms, although AHR 11797 and higher doses of zolpidem decreased time spent in the open arms. Flunitrazepam and zolpidem greatly reduced, CGS 9896 slightly reduced, and AHR 11797 did not affect locomotor activity. Flunitrazepam and CGS 9896 increased food consumption, but AHR 11797 and zolpidem had no effect. Only flunitrazepam fully protected the animals from pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. The qualitative differences in the effects of these compounds observed are difficult to explain by activation of a single benzodiazepine receptor subtype. As Ro15-1788 antagonized all the observed effects, these compounds act through multiple central benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "120": "This work was performed to determine if the alterations in gastric emptying induced by precipitated withdrawal are linked to peripherally or centrally located benzodiazepine sites, in rats treated chronically with diazepam (15 mg/kg/day IP) for 7 days. In sham-capsaicin-treated rats, precipitated withdrawal by flumazenil (15 mg/kg IP) induced an increase of gastric emptying, whereas it had no effect in systemic capsaicin-treated rats. Both groups of animals developed withdrawal syndrome expressed as motor, autonomic, and behavioral signs. On diazepam-dependent rats, central administration of flumazenil (0.15 mg/kg ICV) induced withdrawal syndrome but had no effect on gastric emptying. These preliminary results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors located in the central nervous system are involved in behavioral withdrawal syndrome, whereas benzodiazepine receptors located at the peripheral level are responsible for digestive withdrawal syndrome involving capsaicin-sensitive neurons.", 
    "121": "Behavioral categories were measured in rats left on an elevated plus-maze for 5 min, in addition to the traditional measures. Four independent factors emerged from a factor analysis. The variables that loaded highly and positively on Factor 1, seemingly related with anxiety, were: number of entries onto open arms, time spent on open arms, percentage of open/total arm entries, percentage of time on open arms, scanning over the edge of an open arm, and open arm end-exploring. The time spent on enclosed arms loaded highly, but negatively on the same factor. Risk-assessment from an enclosed arm also loaded negatively on Factor 1. Number of enclosed arm entries, total number of arm entries and rearing loaded highly on Factor 2, probably related to motor activity. However, the total number of entries also loaded on Factor 1, being thus a mixed index. Similarly, the number of open arm entries loaded on both Factors 1 and 2. As expected, the variables having high loads on Factor 1 were changed to one direction by administration of two anxiolytics (nitrazepam and midazolam) and to the opposite direction by two anxiogenic drugs (pentylenetetrazol and FG 7142). Such pattern of drug effects was not observed with the remaining variables."
