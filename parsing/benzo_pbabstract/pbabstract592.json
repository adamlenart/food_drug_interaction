Both phenylquinolines were proconvulsant in combination with subconvulsant doses of picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazole in mice. Both chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) and the imidazodiazepine, RO 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) prevented these tonic-clonic convulsions. In vitro studies of rat cuneate nucleus indicated that the proconvulsant actions of PK 8165 and PK 9084 could be explained by their direct, albeit slightly different, interactions with the GABA-receptor complex. PK 8165 (100 microM) alone had no effect on responses to the GABA analogue muscimol, but enhanced the potency of picrotoxin as an antagonist of muscimol and reduced the potency of flurazepam as a potentiator of muscimol. PK 9084 (100 microM) alone caused a small antagonism of muscimol, but did not affect the potency of picrotoxin; flurazepam reversed the effect of PK 9084.", 
    "1": "When mice are forced to swim a restricted space, they will cease attempts to escape and adopt a characteristic immobile posture. In this study, this immobility was reduced by antidepressants and monoamineoxidase inhibitors. We found that diazepam had the ability to enhance this immobility. It is well known that diazepam exerts its pharmacological effect at least in part through GABAergic functions. Muscimol and aminooxyacetic acid enhanced the immobility. In addition, semicarbazide, bicuculline, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol reduced the immobility and pretreatment with bicuculline decreased this enhancement with muscimol, aminooxyacetic acid and diazepam. It seems that GABAergic functions play some role in the mechanism of this immobility.", 
    "2": "The binding of [3H]propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate [( 3H]PCC) to rat hippocampal and cerebellar membranes was investigated together with the displacement by PCC of [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FNM). Results were consistent with the presence of a single recognition site in cerebellum and two sites in hippocampys, but the affinity of neither of the hippocampal sites correlated with that in the cerebellum. Muscimol did not alter the affinity or capacity of any of these sites under the conditions used, indicating that PCC does not show the benzodiazepine-like property of GABAergic modulation, at any of the subpopulations of its binding sites.", 
    "3": "The effect of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 has been tested against caffeine (200-300 mg/kg i.p.) induced convulsions in mice. It offered protection in lower doses (10 mg/kg i.p.) than had been effective previously against other convulsants such as bicuculline and leptazol. In contrast, diazepam was much less active against caffeine than against the other convulsants and offered no significant protection in doses up to 1 mg/kg i.p. If Ro15-1788 only acts on benzodiazepine receptors then one explanation for the increased activity of Ro15-1788 compared with diazepam against caffeine is that caffeine exerts its convulsant action through a direct effect on benzodiazepine receptors but is more potent at displacing diazepam than Ro15-1788 or alternatively it acts on a sub-class of benzodiazepine receptors that bind Ro15-1788 more effectively than diazepam.", 
    "4": "The interaction of purine-receptor agonists and antagonists with [3H]Ro15-1788 binding sites in rat brain membranes was examined before and after UV-photoaffinity labelling of a proportion of the sites with flunitrazepam. Whereas photoaffinity labelling of the receptors reduced benzodiazepine agonist affinity but not benzodiazepine antagonist affinity, the IC50S of adenosine-receptor agonists, partial agonists and antagonists were unaltered by the conformational changes in the benzodiazepine receptors which are thought to be induced by the photolabelling process. The affinity of dipyridamole, a potent adenosine uptake blocker and potent displacer of [3H]diazepam binding, was drastically reduced by photolabelling.", 
    "5": "Ro 5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) elicited convulsions in mice with a CD50 of 23.5 mg/kg (i.p.) and increased the firing rate of substantia nigra zona reticulata neurons in a dose dependent fashion (0.5-4 mg/kg i.v.). Diazepam and clonazepam, but not Ro 15-1788, were potent inhibitors of Ro 5-4864 induced convulsions. Ro 15-1788 was also ineffective in reversing Ro 5-4864 induced increases in cell firing of zone reticulata neurons. Muscimol potently inhibited the seizures and reversed increases in cell firing elicited by Ro 5-4864. Phenobarbital and pentobarbital inhibited Ro 5-4864 induced convulsions with moderate potencies, while phenytoin and carbamazepine were ineffective at doses of up to 100 mg/kg. These observations suggest that Ro 5-4864 does not elicit its pharmacologic actions through a direct action at a 'brain-type' benzodiazepine receptor. However, both the profile and potency of compounds effective in inhibiting the electrophysiological and pharmacological effects of Ro 5-4864 suggest that this compound may act by perturbation of a component of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complex. These findings do not, however, rule out a direct involvement of the high affinity 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors found in brain.", 
    "6": "Fominoben, a centrally acting antitussive, has been shown recently to bind to the brain benzodiazepine binding site and to antagonize pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. The present study reports the ability of fominoben to produce anti-anxiety effects analogous to diazepam in a mouse exploratory model for anxiolytics. This action of fominoben was blocked by Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, implicating a brain benzodiazepine binding site in this anxiolytic action of fominoben.", 
    "7": "A benzodiazepine antagonist (Ro 15-1788) prevents the development of kindled seizures. CGS-8216, another benzodiazepine antagonist, prevents DMCM-induced seizures (indicating that CGS-8216 acts at a benzodiazepine receptor) but has no effect on kindling or kindled seizures. CGS-8216 prevents the anticonvulsant actions of Ro 15-1788 suggesting that Ro 15-1788 is a partial agonist at an anticonvulsant benzodiazepine receptor. These results support that idea of of distinct, separate receptors for anticonvulsant and sedative effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "8": "Benzodiazepines reduce basal and stimulated rat prolactin (PRL) serum levels in vivo. We investigated whether the inhibition of PRL secretion by the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam, occurs directly at the pituitary. At nanomolar concentrations diazepam did not affect PRL secretion, whereas at micromolar concentrations, diazepam dose-dependently inhibited basal and secretagogue-stimulated PRL release from hemipituitary glands and from primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. The inhibitory effect of the highest concentration of diazepam (100 microM) was abolished when the pituitary tissue was incubated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. Although nanomolar concentrations of diazepam alone did not affect PRL release, they did enhance the PRL inhibitory effect of muscimol, a gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist. Neither diazepam nor muscimol affected cellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) content. Since these effects do not appear to occur through an inhibition of the cAMP generating system, diazepam may inhibit PRL release via a cAMP-independent pathway. We suggest that diazepam inhibits PRL secretion either by enhancing the GABAergic inhibition of PRL release, or by inhibiting, at micromolar concentrations, a benzodiazepine-sensitive Ca2+-calmodulin dependent protein kinase.", 
    "9": "A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic method using an octadecylsilane column and a methanol-water mobile phase was employed for the determination of chlordiazepoxide, chlordiazepoxide X HCl and related impurities in capsule and tablet preparations. Each component is well separated and directly detected by 254 nm absorption. For chlordiazepoxide and chlordiazepoxide X HCl the coefficient of variation for replicated injections was below 1%. Recovery of authentic samples ranged from 98.4 to 101.6% for both capsule and tablet formulations.", 
    "10": "The pathway of breakdown of membrane-bound benzodiazepine binding sites has been examined with proteolytic enzymes. Photoaffinity labeled benzodiazepine receptors were degraded for varying amounts of time and at varying enzyme concentrations. The properties of fractions both remaining in the membrane and released into the supernatant were examined for their apparent molecular weight by SDS gel electrophoresis. Trypsin treatment converted the 46K subunits of the GABA/BDZ complex which bind 3H-flunitrazepam into 40K and 27.5K fragments which remained in the membrane and finally a small fragment which was released into the supernatant. An endogenous trypsin-like activity in the membrane fractions has similar proteolytic effects on the membrane bound receptor.", 
    "11": "22 patients with moderate and severe haemorrhages of the UAC were given endovenous doses of Pirenzepine (100 mg/48 hrs). The drug was effective in 86% of the cases and its effect on pH values was demonstrated by testing before and after administration (p less than 0.01). Better results were observed in the treatment of patients with moderate and severe DUS.", 
    "12": "Formation of gastric lesions in response to conditioned emotional stimulus (CES) and effects of benzodiazepines were studied in mice. The CES was introduced in the form of affective communication through a communication box. The \"senders\" were exposed to electric foot shock and the \"responders\" were able to receive affective cues such as visual, auditory and olfactory from \"senders\". The \"senders\" and \"responders\" exhibited significantly greater gastric lesions than the controls. Diazepam at doses of 2 X 1 - 2 mg/kg (p.o.) and oxazolam at a dose of 2 X 2 mg/kg (p.o.), reduced the formation of gastric lesions of the \"responders\" induced non-physically by CES. The present results indicate that \"responders\" showed bodily changes under CES treatment, particularly in the development of gastric lesions, and that gastric lesions produced by CES were protected by diazepam and oxazolam.", 
    "13": "The interactions of anaesthetics and other drugs with high pressure suggest that protection against the high pressure neurological syndrome (h.p.n.s.) can no longer be considered in terms of generalized non-specific mechanisms. The evidence from our work shows that anaesthetics may either protect, have no effect, or potentiate h.p.n.s. Structural analogues of the steroid anaesthetic Althesin have a protective effect against high pressure tremors in spite of the fact that they have no anaesthetic effects. Low doses of flurazepam are effective against tremor but can be antagonized by Ro 15-1788, which implies in this case a role for the benzodiazepine receptor complex. Pressure interactions with other drugs have included the classic anticonvulsants--which, in general, were relatively ineffective--and various agents perturbing the balance of specific neurotransmitter systems. Representative examples from different studies include 6-hydroxydopamine, muscimol, and sodium valproate. Finally, the potent protection against h.p.n.s. by 2-amino-phosphonoheptanoic acid, an antagonist with preferential action against excitation produced by aspartate and N-methyl-D-aspartate, provides the first evidence that enhanced excitatory amino acid neurotransmission may have an important role in the h.p.n.s.", 
    "14": "Patterns of accidental poisoning in children are changing dramatically. A five year population study (1977-81) was undertaken in urban children from Brisbane (population 1 000 000). A total of 2098 children were poisoned during this period with only one fatality, which represents a dramatic reduction in mortality. Over the past 15 years (1968-82) 13 children have died from accidental poisoning from this population, and two were murdered with drugs. A study of secular trends has indicated that peak incidence occurred in 1979, and the rate has been falling progressively since. The current age corrected rate of poisoning is 393 per 100 000 children per year (0-5 year olds). The rank order of poisons, drugs, and chemicals causing hospital admission and death is: petroleum distillates 13%; antihistamines 9%; benzodiazepines 9%; bleach and detergents 7%; and aspirin 6%. The ratio of fatalities to ingestions requiring hospital admission was calculated to give an index of a practical danger of noxious agents to which children are currently exposed and the rank order is: cardiotoxic drugs, one fatality to 25 ingestions; tricyclic antidepressants, one to 44; sympathomimetic drugs, one to 54; caustic soda, one to 68; aspirin, one fatality to 350 ingestions. Accidental poisoning of children leading to death has been reduced because patterns of drug prescriptions have changed, packaging of dangerous drugs has been made safer, and substances such as kerosene have been coloured blue.", 
    "15": "The specific binding of [3H]pirenzepine ( [3H]PZ) and [3H](-) quinuclidinyl benzilate ( [3H](-)QNB) was investigated in homogenates of human stellate ganglia. [3H]PZ saturation isotherms yielded a Kd of 14 nM and Bmax of 16.7 fmol/mg protein, while [3H](-)QNB binding curves yielded a Kd of 59 pM and Bmax of 33.0 fmol/mg protein. This represents the greatest proportion of high affinity [3H]PZ labeling, relative to [3H](-)QNB, seen in any peripheral tissue examined thus far.", 
    "16": "Diazepam (3 microM) potentiates the adenosine-induced relaxation of caecum. Other benzodiazepine receptor ligands, such as inosine and hypoxanthine, failed to modify adenosine responses. Diazepam failed to further modify the dose-response curve to adenosine obtained in the presence of dipyridamole, and uptake inhibitor. Diazepam and dipyridamole did not affect the responses to 2-chloroadenosine. The relaxant effect of adenosine was not blocked by Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. These observations indicated that diazepam potentiated adenosine response by inhibiting the uptake of purine nucleotide and, that the benzodiazepine receptor is not purinergic in nature in the rat caecum.", 
    "17": "Methods for determining Ro 15-1788 in brain tissue were developed using gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection, and using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Application of the methods to pharmacokinetic studies in the rat found the elimination half-life of Ro 15-1788 from rat brain to be 16 min. Ro 15-1788 was undetectable in rat plasma at the time points studied. Concentrations of Ro 15-1788 in the brain were reduced if chlordiazepoxide was coadministered.", 
    "18": "The spectra of pharmacological effects of ethanol and the benzodiazepine show a degree of overlap. Neurophysiological and neurochemical evidence indicates that both ethanol and benzodiazepines facilitate inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by GABA. Diazepam has been reported to inhibit both the tremor and mechanism of cerebellar cyclic GMP caused by harmaline by a neurotransmission in the cerebellum. Because of the similarities between ethanol and benzodiazepines, the effects of ethanol on harmaline-induced tremor and increase of cerebellar cyclic GMP were studied. Ethanol inhibited harmaline-induced tremor at doses as low as 0.1 g/kg. At this low dose, however, a dissociation between inhibition of harmaline tremor and inhibition of the harmaline-induced increase of cerebellar cyclic GMP was observed.", 
    "19": "Benzodiazepines are among the most widely used drugs in the world. Although there is a public perception that they are widely abused and dangerous, there is minimal evidence to support this suggestion. At the Ottawa Civic Hospital Family Medicine Centre, 3.4% of patients over 15 years old received a prescription for a benzodiazepine. Of this group, 5% received prescriptions for more than two benzodiazepine tablets a day during 1982. Of these 21 patients, five were likely to suffer significant withdrawal reactions. There has been a significant shift to short-acting benzodiazepines over four years to 80% from 16%. There has also been a 15% decline in prescriptions for benzodiazepines between 1978 and 1982. Because benzodiazepines are safe and effective, and appear to be used with care in treating anxiety, they should be accepted as useful drugs for controlling one of the most common symptoms seen in family practice.", 
    "20": "The effects of the GABA agonist, muscimol on [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding were examined in cerebellum and hippocampus regions proposed to contain different populations of benzodiazepine binding site subtypes. Quantitative analysis was made of the contribution of different components of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding by utilising the selective affinities of propyl ?-carboline-3-carboxylate for these sites. The influence of muscimol on each of these components was determined and the results provide clear evidence that GABA receptors interact with only some subtypes of benzodiazepine binding sites; for example, whilst the cerebellar site and the low affinity hippocampal site are influenced, the high affinity site in hippocampus appears to be quite unaffected.", 
    "21": "A series of nucleoside transport inhibitors has been tested for their ability to displace [(3)H]diazepam binding to CNS membranes. No correlation between their potency as [(3)H]adenosine uptake blockers and as inhibitors of [(3)H]diazepam binding was found, either in rat or guinea-pig brain tissue. Dipyridamole, a potent adenosine transport inhibitor interacted strongly (K(i) = 54 nM) with peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (\"acceptor sites\") and was 4-5 fold weaker in displacing [(3)H]methylclonazepam and [(3)H]Ro15-1788, ligands selective for the specific central benzodiazepine \"receptor\". Unlike the benzodiazepines, dipyridamole had no anticonvulsant action against metrazole-induced convulsions in mice. Ro5-4864, a benzodiazepine which selectively interacts with the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, was approximately equipotent with diazepam in inhibiting [(3)H]adenosine uptake in brain tissue. These results do not support the idea of a very close link between high-affinity central binding sites for clinically-active benzodiazepines and the adenosine uptake site. The possibility of a connection between benzodiazepine \"acceptor\" sites and the membrane nucleoside transporter is discussed.", 
    "22": "In recent years the need for rapid, sensitive and specific assays for benzodiazepines has resulted in the publication of a number of high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods for their determination. This paper reviews the methods available to date for the determination of chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam and their metabolites in biological fluids.", 
    "23": "The design and rationale of some novel chiral stationary phases (CSPs) are discussed with respect to methods for determining enantiomeric purity, absolute configuration and for obtaining enantiomerically pure materials by liquid chromatography. The commercially-available dinitrobenzoylamino CSP type 1 is discussed with respect to the chiral recognition mechanisms which may operate in the resolution of some polycyclic and heterocyclic aromatic molecules and some benzodiazepines. N-Acyl alpha-arylalkylamines are also employed as models to formulate mechanisms for the chiral properties of type 1 CSPs in terms of enantiomeric stacking of the most stable conformations in solution. The properties of new types of 'reciprocal' CSPs are discussed and illustrated by enantiomeric separation of some amino acid and amino phosphoric acid derivatives, and by the separation of the following enantiomeric drugs as their 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl derivatives: metoprolol, oxoprenolol, ephedrine and alprenolol.", 
    "24": "The present study aimed to assess the pharmaco-clinical profile of infants premedicated with rectal midazolam. The results were compared with those of a reference drug, flunitrazepam. Infants undergoing minor surgery were divided into three groups: group A (n = 30), with a mean age of 15.8 +/- 13.2 months and a mean weight of 8.6 +/- 3.3 kg, receiving 0.33 mg X kg-1 flunitrazepam; group B (n = 15), with a mean age of 11.2 +/- 10.7 months and a mean weight of 9.3 +/- 3.1 kg, receiving 0.3 mg X kg-1 midazolam; and group C (n = 30), with a mean age of 15.5 +/- 9.1 months and a mean weight of 10.7 +/- 2.5 kg, receiving 0.4 mg X kg-1 midazolam. An aqueous solution of each drug was administered with atropine sulfate (0.02 mg X kg-1) 20 min prior to induction of anaesthesia. The drug was well tolerated in 84% of cases. Statistically significant haemodynamic changes consisted of: a 9 c X min-1 decrease in heart rate (p less than 0.05) and a 12 mmHg decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p less than 0.05) in group C; a 6 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) in group B. The tranquilizer action was either excellent or good in 93% of groups B and C compared with only 40% in group A (p less than 0.001 in both cases). Somnolence was attained in 60% of group A, 26.6% of group B and 30% of group C. A mask was much better accepted in group C (86.6%) than in group B (66.6%; p less than 0.05) or in group A (36.6%; p less than 0.01). Therefore, midazolam given rectally at 0.4 mg X kg-1 was better than flunitrazepam, because of a greater therapeutic effect for an equivalent rate of side effects.", 
    "25": "The object of this study was to determine the optimal dose of midazolam given per rectum which would produce sedation adequate for inducing inhalational anaesthesia in paediatric practice. Five doses were studied: 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35 and 0.40 mg X kg-1. The criteria used to appreciate the effectiveness of the sedation at 30 min were the change in the child's behaviour, with a scale of 6 levels, and the acceptance of the mask and anaesthetic vapours. There was a significant correlation between the dose administered and the degree of sedation, as well as between the dose administered and the lack of reaction to the mask. Significantly better results were found with the higher doses of 0.35 and 0.40 mg X kg-1, when compared with the children who had received 0.15 and 0.25 mg X kg-1. Only in the groups who received 0.35 and 0.40 mg X kg-1 were the degrees of sedation and acceptance of induction considered as adequate. The dose of 0.35 mg X kg-1 seemed to be the best dose for adequately premedicating a child.", 
    "26": "Midazolam was compared with diazepam for the intravenous sedation of gastroscopy patients. 0.1 mg X kg-1 midazolam were given to patients less than 65 years old, and 0.085 mg X kg-1 after that age; diazepam doses were 0,2 mg X kg-1 and 0.15 mg X kg-1 respectively. The effect and duration of action of both drugs were similar. The main differences between them were as follows: the intravenous injection of midazolam was not painful, and virtually no venous complications were seen; amnesia and patient contentedness were more frequent with midazolam; gastric secretion was reduced with midazolam. Neither drug had clinically significant cardiovascular effects.", 
    "27": "The haemodynamic effects of midazolam were compared with those of flunitrazepam in 10 patients with severe head injury under controlled ventilation. Right atrial pressure, pulmonary pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output were measured using a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter. Arterial pressure (Pa) was recorded by radial arterial canulation. All patients in this cross-over study received midazolam (0.15 mg X kg-1) and flunitrazepam (0.02 mg X kg-1) intravenously randomly, with 24 h between the two injections. The measurements were first carried out before and then 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min after injection. The only significant variations after midazolam and flunitrazepam were a fall in Pa (from 93 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 11 mmHg for midazolam and from 89 +/- 14 to 78 +/- 20 mmHg for flunitrazepam) and in cardiac index (from 4.80 +/- 1.03 to 4.17 +/- 1.14 l X min-1 X m-2 for midazolam and from 5.18 +/- 1.32 to 4.54 +/- 1.03 l X min-1 X m-2 for flunitrazepam). The small decrease in heart rate was not significant. The cardiovascular changes after midazolam and flunitrazepam were small and similar for both drugs. It seemed that midazolam and flunitrazepam were safe for sedating head injured patients under controlled ventilation.", 
    "28": "The haemodynamic effects of anaesthetic induction with midazolam, fentanyl and pancuronium bromide were studied in two groups of patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery: group A (10 patients receiving 0.2 mg X kg-1 midazolam) and group B (9 patients receiving 0.3 mg X kg-1 midazolam). Haemodynamic parameters were measured before induction after fluid loading and 15 min after induction. Heart rate, mean right atrial pressure, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, mean pulmonary wedge pressure and right ventricular stroke work index remained steady. On the other hand, mean arterial and pulmonary arterial pressures, systolic, cardiac and left ventricular stroke work indices fell significantly in both groups. However there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.", 
    "29": "In 12 healthy volunteers, the pharmacological effects of midazolam were investigated following intravenous (0.15 mg X kg-1 and 12.5 mg in 6 subjects each), intramuscular (12.5 mg in 6 subjects) and oral administration (20 mg in 6 subjects and 10 mg in 4 subjects). The findings were correlated with the plasma concentrations of midazolam and its alpha-hydroxy metabolite. The effects were assessed using objective and subjective methods (reaction time, memory test and subjects' self-assessment with an analog scale covering the degree of sedation). Plasma samples were assayed for midazolam and its alpha-hydroxy metabolite by gas chromatography. The results of the memory test showed that mnemonic retention and recall of a number remained intact for the period preceding intravenous or intramuscular administration. The maximum impairment occurred at 30 min after injection for recall of a number presented at the 15th min. The impairment was no longer detectable 4 h after injection. The plasma concentration time course was similar to that of the reaction time after administration of an identical intravenous or intramuscular dose. The maximum effect was attained within 15 min and 30 min after intravenous and intramuscular administration respectively. Within 2 to 4 h after parenteral administration, the reaction time had returned to normal. At identical plasma concentrations of midazolam, the reaction time was slightly longer in the period immediately following oral administration than after parenteral administration. This result suggested that the alpha-hydroxy metabolite contributed actively to the effect of midazolam. After its intravenous injection, this metabolite's sedative effects attained their maximum with 15 min, having disappeared 4 h later.", 
    "30": "Studied was the preparation diazepam-pulvis for suspension (DPS) with regard to its tranquillizing and myorelaxing doses, inhibiting the aggression, and preventing the stress conditions in domestic animals and birds. It was established that at oral application to pigs at rates of 1 to 2 mg/kg body mass DPS produced a pronounced tranquillizing effect, while at 3 mg/kg it led to myorelaxation as well. In sheep tranquillizing effect was seen when amounts of 3 to 5 mg/kg body mass were used, and myorelaxation was achieved with 6.6 to 13.2 mg/kg. In male calves tranquillization was manifested after doses of 3 mg/kg body mass were applied. In hens the tranquillizing dose was found to be 3 mg/kg body mass, and the myorelaxing one--4 mg/kg; in cocks the respective doses were 5 and 7 mg/kg body mass. At the rate of 3 mg/kg body mass DPS was found to enhance the thiopental-sodium narcosis. When offered to pigs at 2 mg/kg body mass in admixture with the feed DPS led to tranquillization and suppression of the active and passive defense response. No full prevention of cannibalism could be achieved. The daily administration in the course of 30 days with the ration of bull-calves at the rate of 3 mg/kg body mass was shown to calm the animals under loose housing in boxes and affect favourably their weight gain. Admixed with the feed of cocks at 5 mg/kg DPS suppressed aggressiveness.",

Two to three days later, 6 of these subjects received 5 mg of midazolam intramuscularly, and another 6 of the subjects received 10 mg of the drug orally. The plasma concentration-time curves were again studied pharmacokinetically. After intravenous dosing, the mean (+/- SD) elimination half-life (2.14 +/- 1.24 h) showed a statistically significant trend to increase with age in the subjects older than 60 years. While the mean (+/- SD) clearance value (0.30 +/- 0.19 l kg-1h-1) tended to fall with age in the elderly subjects, this trend was not statistically significant. Apparent volume of distribution did not appear to be related to advancing age beyond 60 years, and this parameter (mean +/- SD) did not differ to a statistically significant extent between the aged subjects (0.77 +/- 0.47 l kg-1) and the young subjects studied previously (1.09 +/- 0.58 l kg-1). Atropine premedication did not appear to alter the dispositional parameters of the intravenously administered drug. Intramuscularly administered midazolam was absorbed rapidly. Bioavailability appeared incomplete (F = 0.59 +/- 0.15, mean +/- SD), possibly due to saturable elimination of the drug at the higher plasma levels which were obtained after intravenous midazolam.

    "34": "These experiments were designed to test the positive reinforcing property of a benzodiazepine in normal volunteer subjects. A choice procedure was used to measure preference for lorazepam, a benzodiazepine with a relatively short plasma half-life, over placebo. In separate experiments, subjects were given a choice between three doses of lorazepam (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg, p.o.) and placebo, and in a fourth experiment subjects were given a choice between lorazepam (1.0 mg) and a therapeutically equipotent dose of diazepam (5 mg). Subjective effects of the drugs were monitored using an experimental version of the Profile of Mood States and a shortened version of the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Subjects showed no preference for 0.5 mg lorazepam over placebo (49% drug choice) or for 1.0 mg lorazepam over diazepam (46% lorazepam choice). However, subjects preferred placebo to both 1.0 and 2.0 mg lorazepam (32% and 16% drug choice for 1.0 and 2.0 mg, respectively). Subjective effects were consistent with the drug's known sedative and anxiolytic properties. Relative to diazepam, lorazepam had a longer duration of effect than might be expected from its plasma half-life. Differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of the two drugs account for the results. The results showed that lorazepam is not an effective positive reinforcer in these subjects, suggesting that it also does not have high dependence potential in this population.", 
    "35": "The effect of the chronic administration of diazepam on vestibular compensation (post-unilateral labyrinthectomy) was studied in squirrel monkeys. An intramuscular injection of diazepam (2 mg/kg) was given daily for a period of 4 weeks post-operatively. After daily injection, reduction of the slow-phase eye velocity ( SPEV ) of spontaneous nystagmus and enhancement of locomotor body dysequilibrium were found in the early post-operative stage. However, these pharmacological effects decreased gradually and almost no remarkable effect was found about 3 weeks after surgery. When compared to control animals, no marked differences was found in SPEV reduction of spontaneous nystagmus in injected animals during the vestibular compensation period. Platform runway tests showed that the average number of calendar days needed to regain the pre-operative level of locomotor balance function in the group injected with diazepam was even less than that of the control group. Thus, post-operative daily diazepam injections did not retard the vestibular compensation. The possible neural mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is discussed.", 
    "36": "The effectiveness of phenazepam, lithium and haloperidol used in combination was studied in schizophrenic patients with different courses of the disease. These drugs were used in doses lower than average therapeutic doses usually employed. The multiple modality therapy studied proved to be effective even in those cases where the patients had been resistant to earlier conducted active antipsychotic methods of treatment. In addition, there were no marked side effects in the form of extrapyramidal disorders. The follow-up study showed that the use of this treatment modality, having no effect on the progression of the schizophrenic process, may serve as a method of choice. This therapy has a number of advantages as compared with other treatments.", 
    "37": "In 6 normotensive, healthy male volunteers the pharmacodynamic responses (blood pressure, heart rate; sedation index, tracking test, reaction time) to metoprolol (100 mg bid orally), diazepam (0.1 mg/kg intravenously) and to their combination were studied. The pharmacokinetics of diazepam were also compared in a cross-over experiment, with and without pretreatment by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist to evaluate the possibility of a drug interaction. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic investigations indicated that metoprolol only slightly impaired the elimination of diazepam (18% decrease in total clearance, 25% increase in elimination half-life). The pharmacodynamics of metoprolol (17% decrease in heart rate, 17% decrease in diastolic RR) was not significantly altered by the bolus injection of diazepam. The extent of prolongation in choice reaction time (RT2) induced by diazepam was significantly (p = 0.001) more pronounced following the co-administration of metoprolol. However, the results of RT1, the tracking test and the sedation index did not indicate any increased effect due to the beta-blocking agent. It is concluded that concomitant treatment with metoprolol and diazepam causes only minor and clinically irrelevant changes in drug metabolism and drug response.", 
    "38": "The safety and efficacy of lorazepam and diazepam were compared in the treatment of the acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome during a five-day double-blind trial in alcoholic patients. The daily doses of lorazepam and diazepam were tapered from 6 or 8 mg to 2 mg and from 30 or 40 mg to 10 mg, respectively, during the first four days; no medication was given on day 5. Drug efficacy was measured by Total Severity Assessment Scores (TSAS), the three TSAS factor scores, and by the physician's global evaluation. Of the 55 inpatients enrolled, 47 completed the study. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in any of the efficacy assessment measures. The physical conditions of the majority of the patients treated with lorazepam (57%) and diazepam (59%) improved during therapy. There were no clinically significant differences between the treatment groups in vital signs or laboratory values. The results of this study indicate that lorazepam is as effective as diazepam in reducing the symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal. When lorazepam and diazepam are compared in terms of their pharmacokinetics, lorazepam may have therapeutic advantages for the management of the acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "39": "The effects of the clinically most commonly used minor tranquilizer, diazepam, on the survival time and on the mechanism of death in non-acclimated and cold-acclimated guinea pigs in severe cold exposure (-20 degrees C) were studied. Cold acclimation for 2 months increased the average survival time from 4 h to 10 h. The lowest rectal temperature at death (14.6 degrees C) was seen in the cold-acclimated animals. Diazepam at a dose of 5 or 15 mg/kg i.p. 30 min before the beginning of the exposure reduced dose-dependently the cold endurance of both cold-acclimated and non-acclimated guinea pigs. The serum glucose and free fatty acid concentrations were low in the animals with the long survival time. Histological studies of liver, kidney, and adrenal glands showed no specific changes. Exposure seemed to increase the frequency of contraction bands and to decrease focally the intensity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase reaction in the myocardium, which indicates a mild hypoxic lesion of the muscle cells.", 
    "40": "Previous studies have implicated the benzodiazepine receptor in the sleep-inducing effects of these widely used hypnotics, but the effector mechanism of this process is poorly understood. There is also in vitro evidence that benzodiazepines enhance calcium entry into synaptosomal preparations, leaving open the possibility that altered calcium flux may be involved in their actions. In order to explore this hypothesis, we administered intraventricular nifedipine, a calcium blocking agent. It was found that pretreatment with a dose of nifedipine which by itself does not affect sleep will prevent sleep induction by flurazepam in rats. Effects on anticonvulsant properties of flurazepam or anxiolytic effects of diazepam were not apparent. This suggests that changes in calcium channel function may be involved in the hypnotic action of benzodiazepines.", 
    "41": "The site-specific binding of the potent and selective nucleoside transport inhibitor, [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), to the nucleoside transport system of cardiac membranes of several species was investigated. The affinity of [3H]NBMPR for these sites ranged from 0.03 nM in rat to 0.78 nM in dog. The maximal binding capacity of cardiac membranes for [3H]NBMPR was also species dependent and was greatest in bovine and guinea pig heart (2551 and 1700 fmol/mg protein, respectively) and least in rat (195 fmol/mg protein). The affinities of recognized nucleoside transport inhibitors and benzodiazepines for these transport inhibitory sites in guinea pig and rat heart were estimated by studying the inhibition of the site-specific binding of [3H]NBMPR in competition experiments. These values were compared with their inhibitory effects on the transporter-dependent accumulation of [3H]adenosine in guinea pig and rat cardiac muscle segments and with their ability to potentiate the negative inotropic action of adenosine in electrically driven guinea pig and rat left atria. In guinea pig heart, the recognized nucleoside transport inhibitors and benzodiazepines had an order of affinity (dilazep greater than hydroxynitrobenzylthioguanosine greater than dipyridamole greater than hexobendine much greater than lidoflazine much greater than flunitrazepam greater than diazepam greater than lorazepam greater than flurazepam) for the NBMPR site which was similar to those for the inhibition of [3H]adenosine accumulation and for potentiation of adenosine action. In contrast, in rat heart, where the maximal binding capacity of [3H]NBMPR was lower (eightfold), the nucleoside transporter dependent accumulation of [3H]adenosine was also lower (sixfold) and the negative inotropic action of adenosine was not significantly potentiated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "Ketalar was used as the main anesthetic drug in operations of jejuno-ileo-shunting and partial ileo-shunting in 30 obese patients (mainly with concomitant arterial hypertension and ischemic heart disease). To prevent the hypertensive effect of Ketalar an intravenous injection of seduxen and droperidol was made.", 
    "43": "Diazepam has been reported to influence pituitary hormone secretion, with several studies claiming that diazepam provokes growth hormone release. Normal volunteers were therefore examined for anterior pituitary responsiveness to 10 mg diazepam i.v. and p.o. The drug had no significant effect on the secretion of prolactin or thyrotropin when compared to control saline injections in all subjects. Growth hormone response was variable; serum growth hormone increased significantly in only 4 of 10 patients after i.v. diazepam and in only 1 of 7 subjects tested with oral diazepam. Serum cortisol rose in only 1 subject, precluding a stress-related explanation for the increase in growth hormone. We conclude that diazepam inconsistently stimulates growth hormone secretion and should not be relied upon as a test of growth hormone reserve.", 
    "44": "The radiation response of mammary tumours transplanted into syngeneic C3H mice has been measured with the animals breathing air or 100% oxygen at 290 kPa (HPO), either with or without ketamine plus diazepam anaesthesia. The single doses needed to cure 37% of tumours within 40 days (TCD37/40) for mice anaesthetised with ketamine plus diazepam and for unanaesthetised mice irradiated in air were not significantly different, 66.5 Gy and 68.8 Gy respectively. When animals were irradiated in HPO, the TCD37 value was significantly reduced from 60 Gy with no anaesthetic to 41 Gy with ketamine plus diazepam anaesthesia; an enhancement ratio (ER) of 1.5. The total ER from no anaesthetic in air to anaesthetic in HPO was 1.7 (68.8/41). There was less CNS toxicity for ketamine plus diazepam than for sodium pentobarbitone anaesthesia in mice treated in HPO. The combination of ketamine and diazepam is an unusual anaesthetic in that it maintains blood pressure, cardiac output and respiration in man. Vascular effects and lowered body and tumour temperatures may also have influenced tumour oxygenation and radiation response.", 
    "45": "A case of carpipramine overdose is reported. The patient was admitted with ventricular tachycardia 4 h after taking 2.40 g of the drug. This disappeared at the sixth hour. In overdoses with other tricyclics, ventricular tachycardia was successfully treated within 30 min of starting a sodium lactate perfusion. In the case presented, reversal of the ventricular tachycardia coincided with the half-life of the drug; the effects of perfusing 1000 ml sodium lactate over 2 h seemed doubtful. This sodium resistance may be related to a relative hypokalemia (3.4 mmol X 1(-1) ). The use of sodium lactate for the treatment of overdoses with drugs with short-half lives appeared questionable.", 
    "46": "Seizures and delirium tremens were recorded among 292 randomly selected patients admitted to an in-patient alcoholism program. Despite the almost routine prophylactic use of anticonvulsant and sedative drugs the incidence of seizures and delirium tremens during detoxification in hospital was 3%. However, as most alcohol withdrawal seizures occurred immediately before admission, the overall seizure incidence was higher (10%). Those patients who developed seizures during detoxification admitted previous abuse of benzodiazepines or erratic use of phenytoin. The results suggest that prescribing of anticonvulsants to alcoholics may increase their seizure problems, because they are prone to erratic drug taking, and because of drug-alcohol interactions, increased drug metabolism and abuse of the sedative anticonvulsants.", 
    "47": "In an open-label study of alprazolam in five bipolar-I depressed patients, three patients remitted completely, one failed to respond, and one responded transiently, based on the Hamilton Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Further studies of alprazolam as an antidepressant are warranted.", 
    "48": "We describe the clinical features of a family with photosensitive epilepsy, followed for 13 years. Generalized paroxysmal discharges induced by photic stimulation appeared in all 9 siblings. Generalized seizures, myoclonic jerks, and absences appeared in variable combination in 7 of them who on clonazepam remained free from seizures for a seven-year follow-up period. On EEG the paroxysmal abnormalities induced by photic stimulation abated during clonazepam medication.", 
    "49": "The cause of postoperative shivering is not known. The theories and possible remedies are reviewed. Five hundred patients were observed for the possible effect of lissive doses of gallamine, and of analgesic or benzodiazepine premedication. Diazepam premedication appeared to reduce the incidence of post-halothane shivering.", 
    "50": "In a total of 2239 toxicological laboratory screenings requested from health centres and hospitals in North-Finland during 1973-1982, the most commonly found drug groups were benzodiazepines and phenothiazines. Alcohol was found in an average 45% of the patients screened during the years 1979-1982. Females accounted for 45% of all requests. No seasonal variation in the requests could be observed.", 
    "51": "Rapid difference spectrophotometric methods for chlordiazepoxide and demoxepam in chlordiazepoxide formulations are described which overcome the nonspecificity of the official spectrophotometric assays. The procedures are based on the measurement of the difference absorbance at 269 nm of equimolar solutions of chlordiazepoxide at pH 8 and pH 3 and the difference absorbance at 263 nm of equimolar solutions of demoxepam at pH 13 and pH 8. The methods are specific for chlordiazepoxide and demoxepam in the presence of both compounds, 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, certain coformulated drugs, and formulation excipients. Analyses of commercial dosage forms of chlordiazepoxide have shown the presence of demoxepam at concentrations in excess of the pharmacopoeial specifications in some aged samples.", 
    "52": "A 26-year-old woman with debilitating juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was treated at a Mexican arthritis clinic with two unknown medications. She subsequently developed agranulocytosis and cholestatic hepatitis as an adverse reaction to these drugs, later identified as oxyphenbutazone and diazepam. The etiology of these drug-induced problems is reviewed, and the dangers of this unorthodox form of medical therapy are discussed.", 
    "53": "Comparative analysis of the effects of the drugs belonging to the same series was made in experiments on rats with generalized myoclonus and pain syndrome of spinal origin. The syndromes were produced by creating the generator of pathologically enhanced excitation in ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord. Phenazepam and clonazepam were found to be the most effective drugs for both forms of pathological conditions. They produced a marked anticonvulsant effect in myoclonus and analgetic effects in pain syndrome.", 
    "54": "The effects of increasing depths of anesthesia on the activities of the hypoglossal nerve (HN) and the phrenic nerve (PN) were investigated in artificially ventilated, vagotomized cats. An abrupt increase in inspired concentration of halothane from 1% to 4% immediately decreased both HN and PN activities, but HN activity decreased more and disappeared much earlier than did PN activity. Steady-state responses of HN and PN activities to changes in end-tidal concentration of halothane showed that halothane depressed both HN and PN activities in a dose-related manner but at different rates, suggesting that respiratory control of the tongue muscles and the diaphragm are in part mediated by different neural pathways. Differential suppression of PN and HN activities also was observed following an acute increase in anesthetic depth with thiopental and diazepam. In contrast, no such differential suppression was observed following ketamine administration. Thus, differential suppression of PN and HN may be associated not only with depth of anesthesia but also with the type of anesthetic used.", 
    "55": "Plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolites were measured in maternal and fetal blood after intravenous administration of 90 mg of midazolam to seven pregnant ewes in whom sampling catheters had been chronically implanted. Midazolam and its metabolite 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam crossed the placenta of the pregnant ewe. The fetal/maternal plasma concentration ratio of midazolam and the metabolite was 0.15. The distribution and elimination half-lives of midazolam and the metabolite were identical in both maternal and fetal circulations. The major compound found in the urine was the metabolite 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam glucuronide.", 
    "56": "A previously described series of 1-arylspiro[indoline-3,4'-piperidine]s was reported by us to possess significant antidepressant properties. This biological activity was found to be at a maximum among those compounds bearing an ortho substituent (e.g., NH2 as in 1) in the pendant aryl ring. In order to explore further this \"ortho effect\", we synthesized cyclic analogues of type 3 and 4 in which the position of the o-NH2-substituted aryl group is conformationally restricted and defined. When tested for antidepressant activity by tetrabenazine ptosis prevention in mice, it was found that restriction of rotation of the pendant o-aminophenyl group in these rigid analogues resulted in a loss of antidepressant properties. However, analgesic activity was retained and even improved by this molecular constraint.", 
    "57": "The bronchodilating activity of oral cannabinoids was evaluated in three double-blind experiments that involved the study of dose-response and interactive relationships and the potential development of tolerance. Data indicated that delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 8-THC), cannabinol (CBN), and cannabidiol (CBD) in maximal doses of 75 mg, 1200 mg, and 1200 mg, respectively, did not induce significant dose-related physiologic effects in experienced marijuana smokers. delta 8-THC (75 mg) was, however, associated with bronchodilation, tachycardia, and peak highs less than that after delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC). The combinations of CBN and CBD with low-dose delta 9-THC (5 mg) did not induce significant bronchodilation but did exert interactive effects on heart rate and \"high.\" A 20-day study of daily delta 9-THC (20 mg), CBN (600 mg), and CBD (1200 mg) did not indicate tolerance or reverse tolerance to any drug. We conclude that delta 9-THC and, to a lesser extent, delta 8-THC, have acute bronchodilator activity but that CBN, CBD, and their combinations do not provide effective bronchodilation. The daily use of delta 9-THC was not associated with clinical tolerance.", 
    "58": "A case of severe alcohol withdrawal complicated by seizures, hallucinosis, hypertension, and supraventricular tachycardia is presented. When the patient showed no response to intravenous diazepam (total, 70 mg over 30 minutes) three 0.5-mg increments of propranolol were administered intravenously, resulting in immediate conversion to sinus rhythm and reduction of blood pressure from 210/130 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. The use of intravenous propranolol as an adjunct to standard therapy in the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is discussed.", 
    "59": "[35S]t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPT), a cage convulsant with picrotoxinin-like activity, binds to rat brain membranes to a single site with an apparent KD of 25.1 +/- 5.6 nM and a Bmax of 1.40 +/- 0.22 pmol/mg protein. TBPT binding to rat brain membranes was inhibited by a variety of convulsant, depressant, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant drugs that had previously been shown to inhibit [3H]alpha-dihydropicrotoxinin binding. Depressant drugs such as pentobarbital and the nonbarbiturate (+)etomidate inhibited TBPT binding in an uncompetitive manner. Thus, pentobarbital and (+)etomidate decreased both the affinity and the number of binding sites of TBPT to whole brain membranes. The IC50 values of (+)etomidate (9 microM) and pentobarbital (90 microM) are similar to the EC50 values at which they enhance both [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid and [3H]diazepam binding in cerebral cortex membranes. RO5-4864, which has recently been shown to be a convulsant, also inhibited TBPT binding (IC50 = 10 microM). These results suggest that TBPT binds to the picrotoxinin site and further supports the notion that the picrotoxinin site is an important modulatory site at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "60": "Electroencephalographic examination of patients with giant neurinomas of the auditory nerve treated with diazepam and sombrevin in the preoperative period was effective in specifying definite signs, making it possible, on the basis of the EEG findings, to localize the pathological process at the level of the posterior cranial fossa and to establish its predominant impact on the structures of the posterior cranial fossa. The electroencephalographic data obtained from these patients under electrophysiological control during surgery correlated with the changes in the EEG pattern found in the preoperative period. As a result of the examination carried out, a totality of indices were specified, enabling the localization of the pathological process at the level of the posterior cranial fossa.", 
    "61": "A series of examinations were carried out to determine whether the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus and the amygdaloid nucleus, participates in the production of disequilibrium of the eyes and the body and to clarify the conditions which induce disequilibrium. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's hippocampus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in this part of the brain, through which dysfunction of equilibrium center in the brain stem is eventually brought about. This dysfunction leads to disequilibrium of the eyes and the body. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for neurotic vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that in a certain group of traumatized patients who suffer from vertigo of psychosomatic origin, there are two etiological factors: functional linkage between the temporal cortex and the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus in regard to a memory or a conditioned reflex relevant to vertigo, over-excitation of the adrenergic components involved in the brain connecting the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and equilibrium centers in the brain stem. These two etiological factors induce disequilibrium by a trigger-and-target relationship in which the former acts as a trigger and the latter as a target. The cerebellum is not an essential factor in producing vertigo of psychosomatic origin, but it enhances vertigo of this type through activation of the adrenergic components, particularly those in the hippocampus. Thus, in patients with both vertigo of psychosomatic origin and cerebellar symptoms recovery from vertigo tends to be delayed. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's amygdaloid nucleus, particularly its medial portion and the habenular nucleus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in these parts of the brain. These animals develop disequilibrium of the eyes in response to an olfactory stimulus, such as extract of garlic. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for olfactory vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that traumatized patients who suffered from vertigo due to inhalation of garlic vapor showed hyper-reactivity to adrenaline and developed disequilibrium of the eyes and the body when given a subcutaneous injection of this drug. These findings indicate that olfactory vertigo is induced by a mechanism in which olfactory stimulation affects the above adrenergic components, causing disequilibrium of the eyes and the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Binding studies give direct information regarding the binding of a drug to its receptor. However, it is important to define the conditions of the binding assay such that the binding in vitro agrees with that estimated from whole tissue pharmacology in order to establish the validity of the binding assay. This is relatively easy for antagonist-receptor interactions. In contrast, the agonist-binding properties are generally more complex and may be explained by differences in receptor-effector coupling. Binding studies are also capable of detecting the interaction of ligands with, and elucidating the nature of, an effector which is directly coupled to the receptor. These are manifest as an allosteric modulation of the binding of the drug to its receptor. One parameter which binding studies give is the number of receptor-binding sites: this cannot be obtained from whole tissue pharmacology. Changes in the number of receptor-binding sites can be related to the effects of perturbation of a biological system. However, caution must be exerted in the equation of numbers of binding sites with numbers of physiologically relevant functional receptors.", 
    "63": "58 patients suffering from anxiety neurosis were divided into two groups, matched for age, sex, marital status and symptomatology. In a double-blind trial of 4 weeks' duration one group (28 patients) received alprazolam 0.75-3 mg/day and the other (30 patients) received lorazepam 3-12 mg/day. Both groups showed a steady and significant reduction in anxiety levels as measured by Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression scores at 0, 1, 2 and 4 weeks. However, there was no significant difference in measured anxiety levels between the two groups at any stage. Fewer side effects were reported in the alprazolam treatment group, with the mental confusion symptom occurring significantly less often.", 
    "64": "The effects of pirenzepine (in a dose of 25.0 mg X kg-1) and atropine (2.5 mg X kg-1) were studied on the development of gastric ulceration produced by pylorus ligation, polymyxin B and absolute ethanol, as well as on the gastric secretory responses and plasma level of noradrenaline. It was found that: (1) pirenzepine significantly decreased the development of ulcer formation produced by pylorus ligation, polymyxin B and absolute ethanol without any antisecretory response; (2) atropine inhibited gastric acid secretion, but no effect was obtained on ulcus produced by pylorus ligation, polymyxin B and absolute ethanol; (3) the plasma level of noradrenaline could be decreased by atropine and pirenzepine, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. It has been concluded that catecholamines are not involved in the gastric cytoprotective mechanism of pirenzepine.", 
    "65": "The crystal structures of the antiulcer drug 5,11-dihydro-11-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) acetyl]-6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one dihydrochloride (pirenzepine dihydrochloride, L-S 519 CL 2, Gastrozepin) and its monoprotonated form (pirenzepine monohydrochloride, L-S 519 CL) were determined by X-ray analysis. Molecular mechanics (MMPI) and semiempirical quantum chemical (MNDO) calculations showed that the calculated minimum energy conformations of the tricycle and of the exocyclic amide group are in agreement with the crystal structures. The conformational energies of pirenzepine as a function of four important torsional angles were calculated using different semiempirical quantum chemical methods with the CNDO/2 (complete neglect of differential overlap)-, MNDO (modified neglect of diatomic overlap)- and PCILO (perturbative configuration interaction using localized orbitals)-approximations. The conformation of one local energy minimum corresponds closely to the crystal structure of pirenzepine monohydrochloride. This conformation has a spatial arrangement which is analogous to a single consistent conformation known from the literature of 24 anticholinergic agents determined from their crystal structures by a computer graphics analysis. On the other hand there are no structural relationships of any low energy conformation of pirenzepine to conformations of other classes of tricyclic compounds which could rationalize their antidepressant, neuroleptic or antihistaminic activity. This finding explains the absence of any central effect of pirenzepine following intracerebral application. The computational elucidation of the conformational requirements for the interaction with the muscarinic receptors may be helpful for the interpretation of the selectivity of pirenzepine within the muscarinic system.", 
    "66": "A study has been made on the modifications that appear after acute dosage of pirenzepine in a series of eight healthy subjects of both sexes who had shown, by radioisotopic evaluation, a physiological pattern of gastric kinetics. The acute dosage of the drug was continued for three days at therapeutic doses and, a few hours after the last administration, the same study was repeated. As a test meal, a whole fried egg containing 99mTc-labelled serum albumin was used. The kinetics of the gastric content was scanned by a gamma-camera. The difference in gastric kinetics between the baseline situation and that after administration of the drug is reported and discussed.", 
    "67": "The anti-ulcer and antisecretory properties of 3-(dibenz[b,e] oxepin - 11(6H)-ylidene)-N,N- dimethylpropylamine hydrochloride (doxepin) were investigated in a series of acute experiments in rats with gastric and duodenal ulcer. Acute gastric ulceration induced by immobilisation and stress (waterbath), and by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, was reduced by doxepin to the same extent as by pirenzepine and cimetidine. Doxepin and cimetidine showed a weak but significant effect against serotonin-induced ulcers in the rat, but pirenzepine did not. Duodenal ulcer caused by increased acid production (pentagastrin plus carbachol induced) was suppressed by pirenzepine, doxepin and cimetidine. The inhibition of gastric secretion by doxepin was studied in anaesthetised rats and conscious dogs. In the Lai rat, doxepin decreased carbachol-induced secretion of hydrochloric acid more effectively than cimetidine. Doxepin was as ineffective as pirenzepine against histamine- or pentagastrin-induced secretion. In the dog with gastric fistula, doxepin inhibited the acid production induced by 2-desoxy-d-glucose more effectively, and for longer periods, than that induced by pentagastrin or histamine. In the dog with a Heidenhain pouch, doxepin reduced the acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin and carbachol, and by histamine, less effectively and for a shorter time, than cimetidine. The antagonism of doxepin to the action of carbachol in the rat and that of 2-desoxy-d-glucose in the dog appears to be an important factor in its mode of action. To inhibit the secretion of saliva and to delay intestinal transport, a dose of doxepin 3-10 times greater than that required for anti-ulcerative and secretion-inhibitory effects was necessary.", 
    "68": "Acute gastric ulcerations were produced in fasted rats by pylorus ligation or by administration of polymyxin B or absolute ethanol. In pylorus-ligated rats pirenzepine 25 mg/kg per os decreased by about 50% the ulceration score, without affecting gastric acid and pepsin output. A similar percentage inhibition of ulceration score with no change of gastric acidity was obtained with pirenzepine 5 mg/kg per os in the case of gastric lesions provoked by polymyxin B. Ethanol-induced gastric lesions were also markedly reduced by pirenzepine, with 50% inhibition occurring with the dose of 25 mg/kg. The release of catecholamines from rat isolated gastric tissue during stimulation of sympathetic periarterial nerves was significantly reduced by pirenzepine 1 X 10(-6) g/ml. The present results indicate that pirenzepine significantly reduced gastric lesions induced by various stimulants; the protective effect of pirenzepine did not appear to be related to increased sympathetic tone.", 
    "69": "In 11 volunteers gastric acid secretion was measured under basal conditions and after modified sham-feeding after 4 1/2 days' treatment with placebo tablets twice daily (placebo), pirenzepine, 50 mg twice daily (pirenzepine), benzilonium bromide, 17.5 mg twice daily (benzilonium 35), or benzilonium bromide, 35 mg twice daily (benzilonium 70), respectively. The first basal portion of gastric fluid was cultured aerobically and anaerobically, and its nitrite concentrations were measured by a colorimetric technique. Basal acid output was reduced 40% by pirenzepine, 71% by benzilonium 35, and 84% by benzilonium 70. Reduction of the stimulated acid output was 47%, 57%, and 74%, respectively. Mean bacterial count (in log10/ml gastric juice) after placebo was 3.50 +/- 0.81 (SEM). Only the treatment with benzilonium 70 gave significantly increased bacterial counts (6.41 +/- 0.68; p less than 0.01). Mean nitrite concentrations (in mumol/l) after placebo, pirenzepine, benzilonium 35, and benzilonium 70 were 2.90 +/- 1.26 (SEM), 3.90 +/- 1.17, 11.36 +/- 7.24, and 18.81 +/- 5.71, respectively. The last value was significantly different from that after placebo (p less than 0.025). Bacterial counts were negatively correlated to basal acid output (p less than 0.001) but not to stimulated acid output. Nitrite was directly correlated to bacterial counts and inversely correlated to basal and stimulated acid output. Even a short-lasting but strong inhibition of gastric acid output by antimuscarinics can change the intragastric milieu significantly. No significant changes occur after moderate reduction of gastric acid output.", 
    "70": "The high seizure susceptibility in epileptic fowl is an autosomal recessive trait characterized in homozygotes by seizures that occur spontaneously and in response to photic stimulation or hyperthermia. Both of the latter stimuli can be used to evoke seizures in drug studies. Epileptic fowl have abnormal inter-ictal EEG activity. When exposed to photic stimulation spiking is apparent on the EEG at seizure onset. Phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, and valproic acid reduce seizure susceptibility at plasma concentrations approximating those used to control generalized and focal cortical tonic-clonic seizures in humans. Carbamazepine and the benzodiazepines also reduce seizure susceptibility. These data indicate that epileptic fowl provide a useful model for generalized and focal cortical tonic-clonic epilepsies. Ethosuximide was inactive in epileptic fowl. However, trimethadione had anticonvulsant activity indicating that this model is only relatively specific for the above seizure types. When seizures were evoked by hyperthermia phenobarbital but not phenytoin or valproate reduced seizure susceptibility. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), AOAA (amino-oxyacetic acid) and THPO (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c] pyridin-3-ole, a glial specific inhibitor of GABA uptake) all have anticonvulsant activity against seizures evoked by photic stimulation in young chicks. These data indicate that this model may be particularly useful for studies of the anticonvulsant activity of compounds designed to enhance GABAergic transmission.", 
    "71": "The effects of the benzodiazepines clonazepam (CLZ) and diazepam (DZ), introduced independently and in combination with cyproheptadine (CY) upon single and repeated application on apomorphine stereotypy in rats were studied. On single application CLZ shortened the duration of apomorphine stereotypy and DZ did not change it. On repeated application (14 days) CLZ reduced stereotypy while DZ increased it. Cyproheptadine on both single and repeated application reduced apomorphine stereotypy. On single application the combination of CLZ and CY increased stereotypy and the combination of DZ and CY increased gnawing behavior. On repeated administration the combination of CLZ and CY reduced apomorphine stereotypy to a higher extent than did CLZ when applied alone. The CLZ- and DZ-induced changes in apomorphine stereotypy were determined through a mediated effect in which 5-hydroxytryptamine plays an important role.", 
    "72": "Rats were treated for two weeks with haloperidol alone or with additional test drugs and the D2 receptor density in the striatum was investigated after a drug-free period of five days. The D2 receptor system as analysed by [3H]-spiperone binding was best characterized by a model with two binding sites of different affinity and the following constants: KDhigh = 0.13 nmol/l; KDlow = 5.8 nmol/l; Bmax high = 107 fmol/mg prot.; Bmax low = 598 fmol/mg prot. Chronic haloperidol treatment substantially augmented the total binding capacity primarily, if not exclusively, due to an increase of Bmax low. 2-(2-Oxo-3-piperidyl)-1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one-1,1-dioxide (supidimide), a functional synergist of neuroleptics in acute experiments, surprisingly antagonized the haloperidol-induced receptor augmentation, whereas other CNS depressants (diazepam and phenobarbital) were ineffective.", 
    "73": "The syndrome of sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice is described. Protection against seizure responses is provided by intraperitoneal administration of conventional anticonvulsant drugs with benzodiazepines being the most potent, and valproate, ethosuximide and trimethadione the least potent. Protection is also provided by intracerebroventricular administration of anticonvulsant drugs. GABAergic agents, antagonists of excitation due to dicarboxylic amino acids, alpha 2-noradrenergic agonists, and dopamine agonists all provide protection against the seizure responses. There is, however, no conclusive biochemical evidence that the syndrome is attributable to a defect in one or more of these neurotransmitter systems."
