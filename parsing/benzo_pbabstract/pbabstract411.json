    "0": "The involvement of the dopaminergic (DAergic), GABAergic and serotoninergic (5-HTergic) synaptic mechanisms in neuroimmunomodulation are considered. It is shown that the central DA- and GABAergic systems exert a stimulatory influence on the immune reactivity. Activation of postsynaptic DA receptors with apomorphine and (+)(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine [(+)-3-PPP] at high doses, D2 receptor activation with quinpirole, as well as DA reuptake blockade with amantadine and bupropion, resulted in an increase in the immune response. The intensity of the immune response was also increased during activation of the GABAergic system with the GABA agonist muscimol or the benzodiazepine agonists diazepam and tazepam. On the other hand, decreases in the activity of either system by different drugs inhibiting DAergic and GABAergic neurotransmission (antagonists of DA postsynaptic receptors haloperidol at 1.0 mg/kg and (-)-3-PPP at 6.8 mg/kg, agonists of DA autoreceptors apomorphine at 0.02 mg/kg, (-)- and (+)-3-PPP at 1.7 and 3.4 mg/kg, antagonist of GABA receptors bicuculline, blocker of chloride channels picrotoxin, blockers of benzodiazepine receptors Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-3505) produce suppression of the immune response. The 5-HTergic system is involved in the inhibitory mechanism of neuroimmunomodulation. 5-HT reuptake blockade with 4-(5,6-dimethyl-R-benzophuranil)-piperidine (CGP-6085A) and sertraline led to immunosuppression.", 
    "1": "A new conflict procedure was developed to study the potential anti-punishment effects of 5-HT( 1A) agonists as compared to diazepam. In this paradigm, the opportunity existed for rats to choose during punished periods between immediate, punished reinforcement and delayed, non-punished reinforcement. The results confirm that, for non-sedative doses (1 mg/kg), diazepam increases the number of punished responses. Furthermore, the present paradigm seems sensitive for the detection of 5-HT(1A) activity. Buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, zalospirone and 8-OH-DPAT increased responding for immediate but punished reinforcement. 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine, the common metabolite of the azapirones, does not participate in their anti-conflict effect. NAN 190, a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, was shown to block the 5-HT(1A) agonists. The findings of the present study suggest that benzodiazepines and 5-HT( 1A) agonists reduce the capacity to tolerate delays in reward. Abnormality in serotonin systems may be associated with poor impulse control.", 
    "2": "This study assessed the dependence potential of S-14506 [ 1- [ 2-(4-fluorobenzoylamino)ethyl]-4-(7-methoxy napthyl) piperazine], a novel, potent 5-HT(1A) full agonist with anxiolytic and antidepressant actions in animal models. The dependence potential of S-14506 was compared with that of the benzodiazepine (BZ) chlordiazepoxide (CDP). BZ withdrawal caused weight loss, aphagia and hyperthermia after chronic b.i.d. treatment for 21 days. None of these withdrawal effects were seen after similar b.i.d. S-14506 treatment at high doses. However, the acute pharmacological actions of CDP and S-14506 differed on a number of indices. Specifically, CDP increased food intake and body weight, whilst S-14506 decreased these measures, possibly due to the induction of the serotonin syndrome. Of particular interest was the observation that S-14506 induced marked hypothermia, to which complete tolerance developed very rapidly (after only 1 day). The observation of marked, rapid tolerance to S-14506-induced hypothermia, in conjunction with the absence of withdrawal hyperthermia after prolonged chronic treatment at high doses, suggests that tolerance to this effect of S-14506 can be dissociated from dependence. Collectively, the data reported suggest that the full 5-HT(1A) agonist S-14506 is devoid of dependence potential, other human and animal studies having previously suggested that partial 5-HT(1A) agonists typically induce no, or minimal, dependence.", 
    "3": "Benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands have been demonstrated to affect the performance in tasks measuring attentional abilities. In such tasks, subjects typically are required to discriminate visual and/or auditory stimuli. The possibility that the effects of BZR ligands on the performance in tasks measuring attention are primarily due to effects on discriminative processes has not been tested systematically. Rats were trained to discriminate between simultaneously presented pairs of visual stimuli flashing either at 5 Hz versus 4.17, 3.75, 2.5, 1.67 or 1.25 Hz (group 1; FAST), or at 1.25, 1.46, 1.67, 2.5 or 3.33 Hz versus 5 Hz (group 2; SLOW) for 4.8 s (20 trials per discrimination type; sequence of pairs was randomized). In both groups, response accuracy depended significantly on the discriminability of the stimuli, with near perfect accuracy in response to most different pairs of stimuli and near chance-level accuracy in response to least different pairs of stimuli. Administration of the BZR full agonist chlordiazepoxide (1.56, 6.25, 9.38 mg/kg; i.p.) potently increased the number of errors of omission which, following the higher doses, confounded the effects on absolute numbers of correct and incorrect responses. However, the available data do not suggest that the agonist affected the animals' abilities to discriminate between the stimuli. Similarly, administration of the BZR ligands ZK 93 426 and MDL 26,479 (which negatively modulate GABAergic transmission) produced no systematic effects. These data suggest that the effects of BZR ligands on the performance in tasks measuring attentional abilities are not primarily due to effects on the animals' ability to discriminate sensory stimuli.", 
    "4": "Seven healthy male volunteers had their light sensitivity (melatonin suppression) and melatonin phase measured before and after treatment with temazepam (20 mg) for 7 days. Temazepam did not alter the circadian phase of melatonin secretion (the Dim Light Melatonin Onset, the timing of the peak of secretion), the total melatonin secretion nor the sensitivity of melatonin secretion to suppression by full spectrum light. This is an important negative finding which suggests that the short half-life benzodiazepine hypnotic temazepam does not confound tests of light sensitivity or melatonin phase.", 
    "5": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide and the inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, were compared on the exploratory response of rats to a novel object introduced into a familiar environment containing seven familiar objects. While chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) increased the novelty response, Ro 15-4513 reduced the response in a dose-dependent manner (0.5-5.0 mg/kg). This action was specific to novelty since the response to the familiar objects was unaffected. Both drugs produced some reduction in ambulation. The effects of both drugs were blocked by flumazenil (10 mg/kg), which at this dose did not itself have any intrinsic effect on the response. Muscimol (0.001 mg/kg) had a weak chlordiazepoxide-like effect and baclofen (3 mg/kg) had a weak effect in the opposite direction.", 
    "6": "Altered serotonin transmission has been associated with behavioral complications of degenerative dementia. This study examined whether trazodone, a serotonergic antidepressant, may be useful in treating behavioral syndromes associated with dementia. Twenty-two dementia patients with behavioral problems were treated with trazodone (mean daily dose 172 \u00b1 107 mg; mean duration 20 days). Seventy of cognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms were rated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Global Assessment Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. A global assessment of improvement was made by chart review. Mean scores, with the exception of the MMSE, improved modestly but significantly between admission and discharge. Chart review of target symptoms revealed that 82% of the patients showed moderate-to-marked improvement on discharge, with most able to return to their preadmission residence. Trazodone was generally well tolerated except for occasional mild sedation effects. Results suggest that trazodone may be a useful alternative to neuroleptics or benzodiazepines in treating behavior problems in some demented patients.", 
    "7": "Benzodiazepine use among injecting drug users (IDUs) presents a major clinical and public health problem that may increase in importance. The current paper examines the research on the extent of benzodiazepine use among IDUs and the harmful consequences associated with such use. Numerous studies have found benzodiazepine use to be widespread among IDUs, and to be associated with greater levels of risk-taking and polydrug use, and poorer psychosocial functioning than other IDUs. The injection of benzodiazepines has also been reported, and presents problems in itself. The implications of existing research for both clinical practice and research are discussed.", 
    "8": "Four pyrazoloquninolinone compounds, variations of known high affinity ligands for the GABA A/Benzodiazepine receptors (BDZRs), were synthesized and their affinities for BDZRs in cerebellum and spinal cord measured and compared to the parent compounds, CGS 8216, CGS 9895, and CGS 9896. Using the techniques of computational chemistry, specific properties of both types of compounds were calculated and evaluated for the extent to which they fulfill the minimum postulated requirements for recognition of a cerebellum, \"Type I\", BDZR embodied in our current three dimensional pharmacophore. Additional properties were also calculated and examined as possible further determinants of recognition of the receptor subtype.", 
    "9": "2'-Iodo-nordiazepam (2'-IND), a nordiazepam analog iodinated at the 2'-position of the C-5 phenyl ring, was synthesized and evaluated as a potential radiopharmaceutical for investigating brain benzodiazepine receptors by SPECT. [125I]2'-IND was synthesized by the halogen exchange reaction and purified by HPLC. In an in vitro competitive binding study using [3H]diazepam and rat cortical synaptosomol membranes, 2'-IND showed an almost equal affinity for benzodiazepine receptors as diazepam. In a saturation binding study using rat cortical synaptosomal membranes, 2'-IND displayed a Kd of 1.10 nM and a Bmax of 1.87 pmol/mg protein. Biodistribution and metabolism studies in mice showed that [125I]2'-IND exhibited rapid and high accumulation in the brain, and that the cerebral uptake and distribution of this compound occurred in the intact form. Furthermore, the administration of diazepam and flumazenil reduced cortical uptake by approx. 20%, suggesting that the uptake of 2'-IND occurred at least partly in association with benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "10": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (pBZr) have been shown to be sensitive to hormonal perturbations, including changes in ovarian steroids. This study examines whether estradiol and progesterone modulate pBZr binding in membranes of human blood mononuclear cells, as measured by binding of both 3H-PK 11195 and 3H-Ro 5-4864. Our findings were negative. There was no steroidal modulation of pBZr binding to these membrane preparations in vivo in normal women studied at different sex-steroid phases of the menstrual cycle, or during 8-30 weeks of pregnancy. There was also no effect of hormones on the binding sites in cultures of mononuclear cells treated with estradiol or progesterone (up to 10(-5) M) over a period between 2 and 72 h. Further, we performed in vitro competition experiments, which showed that both steroids are not active at the pBZr. Our data suggest that pBZr located in human blood mononuclear cells are insensitive to the physiological variations of circulating female hormones.", 
    "11": "The etiology of the decrease in renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) binding caused by stress was studied in rats. Prior investigations suggest that the response of the renal PBR to stress occurs independently of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in regulating the PBR. Eighty min of brief, intermittent tailshocks caused increases in plasma renin activity and decreases in renal PBR binding. The stress-induced decrease in renal PBR binding was reversed by pretreatment with captopril. Acute administration of angiotensin II (ANG II) alone caused reductions in PBR binding in kidney, heart, and cerebral cortex. These data suggest that ANG II may be an endogenous factor responsible for regulating the PBR in several tissues during stress.", 
    "12": "Medication-induced sexual dysfunction can significantly interfere with patients' quality of life and lead to poor compliance. This retrospective study examined the records of 100 male veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) selected in alphabetical order from an active treatment file of 230 patients. Forty-two patients had received clonazepam (mean maximum dose: 3.4 +/- 1.6 mg/day) at some point during their treatment. Of these, 18 (42.9%) complained of significant sexual dysfunction (primarily erectile dysfunction). Eighty-four patients received diazepam (mean maximum dose: 52.1 +/- 29.7 mg/day), nine received alprazolam (mean maximum dose: 5.2 +/- 2.8 mg/day) and eight received lorazepam (mean maximum dose: 3.8 +/- 2.4 mg/day). None of these patients complained of sexual dysfunction during treatment with these three other benzodiazepines. Our findings suggest that benzodiazepines, particularly clonazepam in the current study, can be a cause of sexual dysfunction in many male patients. Prospective studies comparing the overall clinical utility of various benzodiazepines are indicated in this and other clinic populations.", 
    "13": "L-365,260 is a CCKB antagonist which has been shown to completely prevent CCK-4-induced symptoms of panic attack in single-dose (50 mg) placebo-controlled studies in patients with panic disorder. The present report is data from one site (n = 38) in a multicenter study (n = 88) designed to assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of L-365,260 in patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. In order to participate, male and female patients were between 18-55 years of age and in good physical health. Following a one-week single-blind placebo lead-in, patients were randomized to 30 mg four times daily of L-365,260 (n = 18; 7 M, 11 F) or placebo (n = 20; 9 M, 11 F) for six weeks. At end of study, none of the efficacy measures, including the frequency of panic attacks, the Physician's Global Improvement Scale, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, were significantly improved over baseline values. L-365,260 was well-tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse events were headache and lightheadedness. Further testing of L-365,260 at higher dosages, or testing of other CCKB antagonists, is required to rule out the usefulness of this novel treatment approach.", 
    "14": "The authors test the hypothesis that patient readiness to change predicts outcome in a placebo-controlled medication trial.", 
    "15": "Out-patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia completed the Stages of Change (SOC) questionnaire, a measure of readiness to change, before being randomly assigned either sustained release (SR) adinazolam or placebo in a 4 week double-blind trial.", 
    "16": "In the \"intent to treat\" analysis, for the 202 subjects who made at least one visit after baseline, adinazolam SR was significantly more effective than placebo on most major outcome measures. Of the 126 subjects who completed the SOC questionnaire, regression analyses showed significant correlations between SOC scores and all 5 outcome measures. In a second analysis, cluster membership based on SOC scores was predictive of outcome on 3 of 5 measures. In each statistical analysis, subjects who were not predisposed to change as measured by the SOC were significantly less likely to change.", 
    "17": "Patient readiness to change was strongly correlated with outcome in a placebo-controlled panic disorder trial with an effective medication. In this study, the SOC category, Precontemplation (i.e., those subjects who reported the belief that they had no problem) were less likely to change compared to those who believed that they had a problem.", 
    "18": "To examine the effect of treatment on lactate-induced anxiety in a controlled study, we infused 44 panic disorder patients with lactate and placebo before and after eight weeks of double-blind treatment with imipramine, diazepam, or placebo. During treatment, both imipramine and diazepam groups improved more than the placebo group. After treatment, patients in both the imipramine and diazepam groups had significantly less anxiety than the placebo patients when reinfused with lactate. In addition, imipramine decreased posttreatment panic attack frequency and diazepam decreased the perceived severity of posttreatment lactate-induced panic attacks. This study demonstrates that diazepam, like imipramine, is an effective treatment for panic disorder, and that both imipramine and diazepam blunt lactate-induced anxiety in a placebo controlled study.", 
    "19": "Rats housed in conditions of noise stress were given daily injections of diazepam (4 mg/kg). Significant tolerance developed to the sedative effects within 5 days of treatment, as measured by head dipping and motor activity in the holeboard and by the number of closed arm entries in the plus-maze. These results are in agreement with other reports of rapid tolerance to sedative effects. However, in contrast to the usual finding of tolerance to anxiolytic actions after 2-3 weeks of treatment, in this study no tolerance developed after 23 days of treatment to diazepam's anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze. On withdrawal from the 23 days of diazepam treatment, there was no anxiogenic response in the plus-maze. Therefore, it seems that when chronic administration of diazepam is accompanied by chronic stress, tolerance does not occur to the anxiolytic effects, although it does develop to the sedative effects.", 
    "20": "The ability to make use of reflective cognitive operations in monitoring and evaluating remembered events is impaired in subgroups of nominally cognitively unimpaired, detoxified alcoholics. Alcoholics, relative to controls, make more errors in identifying the source of remembered information (i.e. whether a remembered word was self-generated or was a stimulus word presented by the experimenter), and are impaired in their ability to inhibit confabulatory errors (intrusions). The cognitive-memory impairment expressed in benzodiazepine-treated normal volunteers mimics this impairment in alcoholics. Disturbances in prefrontal and frontal lobe functions may be involved in this selective impairment in cognition in many alcoholics and may also contribute to what accounts for the failures in reflective cognitive operations observed in amnestic patients.", 
    "21": "Evidence suggests that liver disease per se may contribute to the cognitive and motor impairments encountered in chronic alcoholics. Neuropathologic studies reveal astrocytic changes (Alzheimer type II astrocytosis) in the brains of alcoholic cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma. Pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for hepatic (portal-systemic) encephalopathy in alcoholics include the loss of neuron-astrocytic metabolic trafficking as well as selective alterations of serotoninergic and dopaminergic function. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that endogenous ligands for both central-type (GABA-related) and \"peripheral-type\" (astrocytic) benzodiazepine receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy in these patients. Chronic liver disease may also interfere with brain thiamine homeostasis and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in chronic alcoholism.", 
    "22": "Chronic alcoholics without complicating disease showed greater densities of GABA agonist sites (labelled with the selective ligand [3H]muscimol) on the GABAA receptor in the superior frontal gyrus, in comparison with both precentral gyrus in the same cases, and with superior frontal gyrus in matched controls. Whereas cases with concomitant Wernicke encephalopathy may also have had greater numbers of superior frontal [3H]muscimol binding sites than controls, alcoholics with cirrhosis of the liver showed more muted differences. Since the GABAA receptor is a multimeric complex which also possesses binding sites for \"central-type\" benzodiazepine ligands, it would be expected that data obtained with these compounds should mimic that obtained with [3H]muscimol. This was not so. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding sites showed little variation between case groups, although they showed clear regional differences. [3H]Diazepam sites followed those for [3H]muscimol in uncomplicated alcoholics and alcoholics with cirrhosis of the liver, but were at lower density in superior frontal gyrus in Wernicke cases. Differential expression of GABAA receptor subunit isoform genes may give rise to these disparities.", 
    "23": "Recent studies have shown that alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit mRNA levels are associated with the effects of chronic ethanol exposure as well as genetic selection for ethanol withdrawal seizure sensitivity. We have previously shown that chronic ethanol exposure in rats results in a decrease in the levels of GABAA receptor alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunit mRNAs in cerebral cortex, an increase in the levels of alpha 6 subunit mRNAs in cerebellum and no alteration in alpha 3, GAD, ribosomal RNA or polyA + RNA levels in these regions. Since chronic ethanol administration increases the expression of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites in cortex and cerebellum with no effect on other GABAA receptor recognition sites, we hypothesized that the expression of other subunits would be altered in these regions. In addition, since ethanol appears to interact with zolpidem-sensitive GABAA receptors in rat brain, we investigated the effect of chronic ethanol administration on these recognition sites. Chronic ethanol administration increased [3H]zolpidem binding with no effect on levels of GABAA receptor beta 2 and gamma 2 subunit mRNAs. In addition, we examined the levels of NMDAR1 receptor subunit mRNAs since chronic ethanol administration results in increased levels of [3H]MK-801 recognition sites on NMDA receptors. NMDAR1 receptor subunit mRNAs were not altered following chronic ethanol exposure in rat cortex or hippocampus. These studies underscore the specificity of ethanol interactions with these receptors and the importance of understanding the mechanisms of both GABAA and NMDA receptor regulation in elucidating the etiology of ethanol dependence.", 
    "24": "Triazolam (0.375 or 0.50 mg) or placebo was administered orally to 31 highly anxious dental patients in a double-blind clinical trial 1 hr before treatment. The drug was safe and highly effective, in comparison to placebo, in reducing both anxious cognitions and disruptive movement during oral injections of local anesthetic and drilling. Episodic memory and implicit memory were both adversely affected by the active drug but not the placebo.", 
    "25": "Five hundred and fifty patients underwent general anesthesia with fentanyl, diazepam, and methohexital. Forty-seven (8.5%) developed signs of hypoventilation or airway obstruction. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed mild hypoxemia in three of the 47 cases and mild hypercarbia in six. Airway obstruction was more predictive of abnormal blood gas values than was hypoventilation.", 
    "26": "Neurologic disease associated with hypernatremia in 2 young Vietnamese potbellied pigs is discussed. Both pigs had recent dietary changes likely associated with excessive salt intake. Case 1 was changed from a commercial mini pig ration to a commercial cat food diet containing up to 1.5% salt 3-4 days before the onset of clinical signs. Case 2 was being maintained on a commercial mini pig ration, however the owner often fed the pig potato chips as treats since its purchase 3 weeks previously. There was no history of water deprivation in either pig. Clinical signs in case 1 included facial-motor seizures, sialorrhea, generalized seizures, tenesmus, disorientation, circling, head pressing, and blindness. Case 2 was disoriented, ataxic, underweight, and appeared blind. Both pigs fully recovered with medical therapy. The rationale for fluid and ancillary therapy are discussed in light of the pathophysiology of salt toxicosis in commercial swine.", 
    "27": "This study set out to assess the effect of a letter from the general practitioner, suggesting a reduction in the use of benzodiazepines, and whether the impact of the letter could be increased by the addition of information on how to tackle drug reduction.", 
    "28": "Two hundred and nine long-term users of benzodiazepines in general practice were divided into three groups: two intervention groups and a control group. The first intervention group received a letter from their general practitioner asking that benzodiazepine use be gradually reduced and perhaps, in time, stopped. The second intervention group received the same letter plus four information sheets at monthly intervals, designed to assist drug reduction: The mean age of the 209 people was 69 years (age range 34-102 years).", 
    "29": "After six months, both intervention groups had reduced their consumption to approximately two thirds of the original intake of benzodiazepines and there was a statistically significant difference between the intervention groups and the control group. Eighteen per cent of those receiving the interventions received no prescriptions at all during the six month monitoring period.", 
    "30": "The results indicate that a simple intervention can have a considerable effect on the use of hypnotic and anxiolytic drugs, even with a sample of elderly users.", 
    "31": "Midazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, when injected intrathecally either enhances or decreases antinociception produced by intrathecal administration of morphine in rats. Furthermore, midazolam inhibits binding of several opioid ligands to spinal opioid receptors in vitro [Rattan et al, Anesth Analg 1991;73:124-131]. This study was designed to investigate the effect of midazolam on binding of mu-, delta- and kappa-ligands to rat spinal opioid receptors in the presence of sodium ions which differentially modulate binding of opioid agonists and antagonists. Sodium ions (50-1,000 mmol/l) selectively increased the specific binding of [3H]naloxone but decreased binding of opioid agonists such as [3H]DAGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Methyl-Phe-Gly-ol-enkephalin) to mu-receptors, [3H]DSTLE (Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr-enkephalin) to delta-receptors and [3H]EKC (ethylketocyclazocine) to kappa-receptors in rat spinal cord in vitro. Midazolam (1-100 mumol/l) inhibited the binding of [3H]naloxone, [3H]DAGO, [3H]DSTLE and [3H]EKC. Sodium ions (100 mmol/l) antagonized the inhibition of binding of [3H]naloxone and [3H]DSTLE by midazolam by increasing IC50 values for midazolam. However, sodium ions potentiated the inhibition of binding of [3H]DAGO by midazolam by decreasing IC50 value for midazolam and had a mixed effect on binding of [3H]EKC in the presence of midazolam. Scatchard analysis performed in the presence of sodium ions and/or midazolam confirmed the specific effects of sodium ions as well as midazolam on the Bmax and KD of mu-, delta-, and kappa-receptors. These results suggest for the first time that sodium ions play an important role in the modulation of spinal opioid receptors by benzodiazepines. Sodium ions potentiate the inhibition of DAGO binding but antagonize the inhibition of naloxone and DSTLE binding by midazolam in rat spinal cord.", 
    "32": "To evaluate the efficacy of nasally administered midazolam for sedation before anesthesia in pediatric patients, the authors studied 45 ASA PS 1 or 2 patients (aged 9 months-6 years) scheduled for elective surgery. The sedative effect of intranasal midazolam (0.2 mg.kg-1 or 0.3 mg.kg-1) was compared with that of our standard premedication by score. Significant sedative effect was obtained 4 min (in the 0.2 mg.kg-1 group) and 3 min (in the 0.3 mg.kg-1 group) after nasal administration. Most patients (93%) in the midazolam group became either free from anxiety or calm allowing easy separation from the parents and a smooth induction of anesthesia 10 min after nasal administration. There was no respiratory depression or anesthetic complication during induction of anesthesia, and no delayed recovery was observed. These results indicate that intranasal midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 is an effective and useful method for rapid sedation of children just prior to the induction of anesthesia.", 
    "33": "Anesthesiologists need a safe and effective premedication before general anesthesia and want to help decrease anxiety and minimize psychologic trauma to children. Therefore, we evaluated diazepam suppository (0.5 mg.kg-1 body weight) administered to 21 children before minor surgery under general anesthesia. We evaluated the sedative effect of the diazepam suppository (tablet) on the arrival at the operating room, during anesthesia induction and in the recovery room. On the arrival at operating room, 86% of children were sedated, and 65% of children could be induced smoothly under mask. There was no delayed emergence. Plasma diazepam level at induction was 376.5 +/- 28.4 ng.ml-1, which is the level needed for sedation. We conclude that diazepam suppository is a useful drug for premedication in children.", 
    "34": "We report severe organophosphate poisoning complicated by hypotension and ischemic sequelae in two patients with pre-existing vascular disease. Both patients had a low total peripheral resistance and high cardiac output that were significantly reversed by doses of atropine in excess of those required to control other muscarinic symptoms. Cerebral infarcts and gangrene requiring a below knee amputation were complications of the poisonings. It is proposed that the ischemic complications are due to paradoxical vasoconstriction by acetylcholine at sites of endothelial injury. One patient, who had taken fenthion, also had a significantly delayed peak and prolonged, 2-3 week, systemic toxicity. We propose that stability of the plasma cholinesterase at 6 to 8 h after temporarily suspending oxime provides a rapid guide to the duration of therapy, especially in patients whose complications make clinical assessment difficult.", 
    "35": "Rats showing either large or small reductions in licking following a shift from 32% to 4% sucrose were selectively bred for 7 generations. Rats from the 2 resulting lines reliably differed in successive negative contrast and in activity (radial-arm maze and open field). Differences in activity and contrast were not correlated. Heritability (h2) of the reaction to sucrose shift was reliable in the last 6 filial generations and equaled 0.64 in the F7 generation. The 2 lines did not differ (a) in response to the absolute rewarding value of sucrose or cocaine; (b) in open-field defecations or thigmotaxis; (c) in anticipatory contrast; or (d) in responsivity to midazolam. Responsivity to reward reduction may involve a relatively delimited psychological process that is amenable to selection.", 
    "36": "Serotonin (5-HT) produced concentration-dependent contractions of the isolated rat pylorus in vitro. Serotonergic contractions were antagonized by the calcium L-channel blocker, diltiazem, but not by tetrodotoxin or atropine. Three drugs that block 5-HT2 receptors, ketanserin, xylamidine, and methysergide, unsurmountably inhibited contractions to 5-HT. In contrast, antagonists of 5-HT3, 5-HT1A/1B, beta-adrenergic, or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors did not alter the response to 5-HT. Devazepide, an antagonist of cholecystokinin (CCK) type-A receptors, blocked contraction produced by CCK-8 but not by 5-HT. Conversely, the 5-HT2 antagonists did not affect CCK-stimulated contraction. These results suggest that 5-HT contracts the pylorus by a 5-HT2-like receptor on muscle and that this response occurs independently of CCKergic receptor mechanisms. Furthermore, the parallel between the overall pharmacological profile for serotonergic contraction of the pylorus and that observed previously for the anorectic action of peripheral 5-HT makes the pylorus a logical candidate for peripheral serotonergic control of feeding.", 
    "37": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) was initially identified in many peripheral tissues and in some blood cells. Drugs that bind with high affinity to PBRs have previously been described as having immunomodulating properties. The number of PBRs varies according to the cell population considered. The aim of this study was to study the localization of PBRs in two human leukocyte populations, T4-lymphocytes, and monocytes.", 
    "38": "Both cell populations were purified by negative immunoselection in order to keep only the physiologically accessible sites on the viable cells. Mitochondria were quantified by electron microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. Subcellular localization was then studied after PBR photoaffinity labeling using electron microscopic ultrastructural autoradiography.", 
    "39": "We have shown that monocytes contain twice as many mitochondria as lymphocytes. We have also shown that the global labeling of monocytes by ultrastructural autoradiography is actually higher than that of lymphocytes and the labeling of monocyte mitochondria is higher than that of lymphocyte mitochondria. In addition, the distribution of subcellular labeling indicates that there are different populations of mitochondria in one cell, i.e., labeled and unlabeled, and that the percentage of labeled mitochondria is greater in monocytes. These results are consistent with those obtained in previous binding studies. Finally, over 50% of receptors are localized in cell compartments devoid of visible mitochondria.",

Mice were then tested on postnatal day 14 and 15 in a passive avoidance apparatus for their ability to withhold a step-down response from a vibrating platform. The step-down response was punished with a mild footshock. Each animal was subjected to a maximum of 15 trials. Mice prenatally treated with oxazepam showed an impairment in the acquisition of the task as indicated by shorter latencies to step-down throughout the 15 trials in both sessions (days 14 and 15). As control nonreinforced animals prenatally treated with oxazepam did not show a similar alteration in latency to step-down, these data suggest that prenatal exposure to oxazepam influences behavioral performance of preweaning mice in an aversively motivated task.", 
    "46": "The effects of volatile agents and sufentanil anesthesia on the electrophysiologic properties of the accessory pathway and on the incidence of intraoperative tachyarrhythmias in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are unknown. Therefore, we studied these agents for their use in patients undergoing ablative procedures or requiring a general anesthetic for other surgeries.",

After sternotomy, the electrophysiologic study during antegrade stimulation consisted of the effective refractory period of the right atrium, atrioventricular node, and accessory pathway; the shortest cycle length of the atrioventricular node and accessory pathway; and the coupling interval. During retrograde stimulation, the effective refractory period of the right ventricle and accessory pathway and the shortest cycle length of the accessory pathway were measured and compared to preoperative electrophysiologic values. Patients then were randomized to receive 1 MAC of halothane, isoflurane, or enflurane, and the electrophysiologic study was repeated.",

Enflurane and isoflurane significantly prolonged all parameters related to refractoriness during antegrade conduction, with enflurane having the largest effect. During retrograde conduction, isoflurane prolonged the effective refractory period of the right ventricle and accessory pathway and the shortest cycle length of the accessory pathway, whereas enflurane prolonged only the accessory pathway effective refractory period and shortest cycle length. Halothane had the least effect on refractoriness, causing significant prolongation of the atrioventricular node effective refractory period and the shortest cycle length of the accessory pathway only during antegrade conduction. The coupling interval, a measure of the period of vulnerability to supraventricular tachycardia, was prolonged only by halothane and isoflurane. Supraventricular tachycardia was still obtainable in all patients.", 
    "49": "Sufentanil-lorazepam has no clinically significant effect on the electrophysiologic expression of the accessory pathway. Of the volatile agents, enflurane most, isoflurane next, and halothane least increased refractoriness within the accessory and atrioventricular pathways. Therefore, administration of these volatile agents during ablative procedures may confound interpretation of postablative studies used to determine the success of ablation treatment. Conversely, in patients with preexcitation syndrome requiring general anesthesia for nonablative procedures, volatile agents may reduce the incidence of perioperative tachyarrhythmias because of their effects on refractoriness. Enflurane would be the agent of choice because it increases refractoriness the most without prolonging the coupling interval.", 
    "50": "Oxazepam has recently been shown to induce hepatocarcinogenicity in B6C3F1 mice. Due to the widespread human exposure to this anxiolytic compound and other structurally similar benzodiazepines, we conducted toxicity and cell proliferation studies on oxazepam to determine possible mechanisms whereby this nonmutagenic chemical may have exerted a carcinogenic effect. Male B6C3F1 mice (10 per dose-time group) received diets containing oxazepam at 0, 25, 125, 2500, and 5000 ppm. Mice were treated for 15, 30, 45, or 90 days, at which time they were evaluated for feed consumption, liver/body weight ratios, clinical pathology, serum oxazepam levels, and histopathology of the liver. During the final 7 days before sacrifice, the mice were exposed to BrDU via osmotic minipump to quantify hepatocellular replicative DNA synthesis. Few effects were observed resulting from chronic exposure to oxazepam other than statistically significant, dose-related increases in liver/body weight ratios. Replicative DNA synthesis was significantly increased in a dose-related manner at the 15-day time point in the 125, 2500, and 5000 ppm dose groups, and attained levels of four- to five-fold above control levels which returned to control levels by 30 days. The lack of significant toxicity, sustained increased liver/body weight ratios, and the rapid and transient induction of replicative DNA synthesis are similar to the effects reported for exposure to another widely used therapeutic agent shown to be a nongenotoxic carcinogen, phenobarbital.", 
    "51": "The benzodiazepine receptor tracer [123I]iomazenil (Ro 16-0154, IMZ) can be prepared in close to theoretical specific activity by the reaction of its tributyltin precursor (IMZ-SnBu3) with [123I]NaI in the presence of Iodogen. However, the labeling reaction is associated with variably high amounts of a volatile 123I byproduct. The purpose of these experiments was to characterize the volatile byproduct and to examine the effect on the course of the reaction of the following variables: solvent (MeOH, EtOH, HOAc, H2O), pH (2-7), oxidizing agent (chloramine-T, Iodogen, AcO2H), reaction temperature (22-128 degrees C) and structure of ArSnR3. The order of reactivity of oxidizing agents, at 22 degrees C for 30 min, was chloramine-T > Iodogen > AcO2H. Raising the pH above 5.8 reduced the labeling, whereas raising the temperature increased the yield up to a maximum at 120 degrees (90%); at higher temperatures, decomposition occurred. The best conditions were 50 micrograms precursor, 50 microL 0.02 M chloramine-T; in aqueous HOAc (pH 3.3) at 120 degrees for 30 min. Variable amounts of volatile byproduct were observed for chloramine-T at different temperatures (2-21%) and for the three oxidizing agents at room temperature (3-22%). By contrast, the Bu3Sn derivatives of IBF, epidepride, beta-CIT and the Me3Sn derivative of beta-CIT gave high labeling yields with peracetic acid at room temperature, and < or = 2% volatile radioactivity. The volatile byproduct from the [123I]IMZ preparations was identified as I-[123I]iodobutane by its trapping characteristics and by its retention time in two different HPLC systems. Volatile activity was not generated in the absence of Bu3Sn precursor and was not due to the presence of impurities in the tributylstannyl precursor.",

There were 58 cases of bupropion ingestion and nine cases of combined bupropion and benzodiazepine ingestion. Sinus tachycardia was the only toxic cardiovascular effect noted, except for one case of hypotension in the bupropioin and benzodiazepine group. Neurological toxicity was commonly encountered and included lethargy, tremors, and seizures. Both benzodiazepines and phenytoin were efficacious in controlling seizures. Five cases of pure bupropion overdose had electrolytes reported. Serum potassium ranged from 2.6 to 4.2 mEq/L (mean, 3.3 mEq/L).

RO 15-1788 (flumazenil), a specific antagonist of brain benzodiazepine receptors, could thus reverse the neurological symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. To test this possibility, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of the efficacy of flumazenil in cirrhotic patients in hepatic coma. Seventy-seven cirrhotic patients in hepatic coma were evaluated. Fifty-six were excluded from the trial because of multiorgan failure or because coma was precipitated by prior use of benzodiazepines, and 21 patients were randomly assigned to the flumazenil group (11 patients) or the placebo group (10 patients). Treatment was administered intravenously as a 20-ml solution (placebo or 2 mg flumazenil); seven patients were crossed over. Clinical status was assessed blindly by two observers, using a modified Glasgow scale, every 15 min for 6 hr. Electroencephalogram tracings obtained before and after drug administration were evaluated blindly by two independent observers. Serum concentrations of benzodiazepines before treatment were measured by means of a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Improvement in neurological symptoms was observed in six patients treated with flumazenil, whereas none in the placebo group showed improvement (p < 0.05; Fisher's exact test). Improvements in electroencephalogram tracings were demonstrated in four patients treated with flumazenil, compared with two patients in the placebo group (p = NS). Benzodiazepines were found in the serum of four patients treated with flumazenil (two responders and two nonresponders); all of these patients had received pharmaceutical benzodiazepines 4 to 6 days before the trial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Levels of benzodiazepine receptor ligands were measured in plasma samples from 25 patients in various stages of hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant liver failure who were not exposed to pharmaceutical benzodiazepines immediately before or during hospitalization. Chromatographic analysis of extracted plasma samples revealed one to nine fractions containing material that competitively inhibited [3H]flumazenil binding to benzodiazepine receptors with the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Two of these peaks were positively identified as the 1,4-benzodiazepines diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam on the basis of chromatographic, ultraviolet and mass spectral evidence. The plasma levels of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam were significantly increased above control values in stage 4 hepatic encephalopathy, whereas total benzodiazepine receptor ligand concentrations were increased above control in stages 1 through 4. A significant but weak linear correlation was found between the relative increase in the levels of diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam and total benzodiazepine receptor ligands and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. Thus increased concentrations of benzodiazepine receptor ligands appear to contribute to the enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission in hepatic encephalopathy, particularly in stage 4. These results constitute further support for a role for benzodiazepine receptor ligands in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy associated with acute liver failure.", 
    "62": "Pediatric epileptology is very different from adult epileptology. Although some epileptic disorders occur in both children and adults (e.g., localization-related epilepsy with complex partial seizures and primary generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures), other disorders can be called the catastrophic epilepsies of childhood (e.g., infantile spasms and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). They occur, or at least begin, exclusively in childhood and are often associated with mental retardation. Many of these pediatric disorders are notoriously unresponsive to currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Although there are undoubtedly many reasons for this, one possible explanation is that the methods used to screen potential AEDs use animal models of adult epilepsy. No screening program uses an animal model of seizures that begin during development and lead to functional decline.",

It should not be performed as an in-office procedure in patients with unstable angina, respiratory failure, active upper gastrointestinal bleeding or hemodynamic instability. Although office esophagogastroduodenoscopy is safe for low-risk patients, the risks associated with anesthesia and the need for postprocedure observation may require other patients to undergo the procedure in a hospital setting. Use of a local anesthetic throat spray reduces the gag response that occurs when the endoscope is swallowed.

Complications are rare and most frequently result from medications rather than from the procedure itself.",

Assessment of the density of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in thiamine-deficient animals showing no neurologic signs of thiamine deficiency encephalopathy, and revealed no significant alterations compared with pair-fed control animals in any brain region studied. Densities of [3H]PK11195 binding sites were, however, significantly increased in brain regions of the rat at the symptomatic stage, where increased densities were seen in the inferior colliculus (233% increase, p < 0.001), inferior olivary nucleus (154% increase, p < 0.001) and thalamus (up to 107% increase, p < 0.001). Histologic studies of these same brain regions revealed evidence of neuronal cell loss and concomitant gliosis. Densities of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in nonvulnerable brain regions that showed no histologic evidence of neuronal loss, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and caudate-putamen, were not significantly different from those in control animals. Increased densities of binding sites for the PTBR ligand probably reflect glial proliferation and are consistent with an excitotoxic mechanism in the pathogenesis of neuronal cell loss in thiamine deficiency encephalopathy. Positron emission tomography (PET) using [11C]PK11195 could offer a potentially useful diagnostic tool in WKS in humans.", 
    "69": "Two benzodiazepine compounds, [7-chloro-5-(2-pyrryl)-3H-1,4 benzodiazapin-2-(H)-one] (Ro5-3335) and [7-chloro-5-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-3H-benzo[e] [1,4] diazepin-2-yl]- methylamine (Ro24-7429), inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication via a specific effect on the function of the transactivator protein, Tat. To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of these compounds, we have tested their effects in an alternative assay for Tat activation in Xenopus oocytes. In this system, translation of trans-activation response element (TAR)-containing RNA is activated by Tat. Both compounds specifically blocked activation of translation in a dose-dependent fashion, with Ro24-7429 showing the greater potency. In the Xenopus oocyte system, as in mammalian cells, mutation of the TAR loop sequences abolishes Tat action. However, it is possible to obtain TAR-specific, Tat-dependent activation of a target RNA with a mutation in the loop provided that this target is in large excess. This result has been interpreted as indicating that a negative factor has been titrated (M. Braddock, R. Powell, A.D. Blanchard, A.J. Kingsman, and S.M. Kingsman, FASEB J. 7:214-222, 1993). Interestingly Ro24-7429 was unable to inhibit the TAR-specific but loop sequence-independent mode of translational activation. This finding suggests that a specific loop-binding cellular factor may mediate the effects of this inhibitor of Tat action. Consistent with this notion, we could not detect any effect of Ro24-7429 on the efficiency of specific Tat binding to TAR in vitro.",

Increasing efficient systems are now available with a marked advantage for patients. Simple analgesia-sedation is often sufficient when requested by the patients and the duration of treatment has been considerably decreased. The authors present a review of their results with the new Lithostar 2 Model C shock wave generator system. The modifications made to this system take into account physical possibilities and medical requirements. As a result of the new configuration of this system, the treatment time per patient has been further decreased, a higher energy is applied to the stones and the disintegration rate is excellent.", 
    "71": "Pharmacological studies on pirenzepine (PZ), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine (4-DAMP) and AFDX-116 antagonism of carbachol (CCh)-induced contraction, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production and cAMP formation revealed the involvement of M3 receptors in these responses. The PA2 values for PZ and 4-DAMP antagonism to CCh-induced contraction were 7.1 and 9.0, respectively, and AFDX-116 had no effect on these responses. Further, 4-DAMP was a much more potent inhibitor than PZ of CCh-stimulation of IP3 production and cAMP formation. Both L-type calcium channel blockers, which inhibit Ca2+ influx, and BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, inhibited these biochemical and pharmacological responses due to CCh. It is concluded that both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ mobilization are involved in muscarinic stimulation of cAMP production, and that M3 receptors are coupled to the activation of both phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase in this tissue. The data presented here are consistent with previous work that stimulation of muscarinic receptors in dog iris sphincter with CCh (> 5 microM) increases intracellular cAMP levels.",

(Fifty cases out of 194 prescriptions as compared to 14 cases of all other benzodiazepines combined.) Psychiatrists wrote 68%, neurologists 15% and internists 14%.

    "73": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in the ovary, oviduct, uterus, and kidney of immature rats were studied under short- and long-term treatment with testosterone (T), progesterone (P4), and diethylstilbestrol (DES). A significant increase in PBR specific binding was observed after 4 days' treatment with T in the ovary (1.6-fold), oviduct (2.0-fold), and uterus (1.4-fold) compared with intact rats. Four days' treatment with P4 increased PBR specific binding in the ovary (1.5-fold), but no changes were detected in the oviduct or uterus. In contrast, PBR specific binding was significantly reduced by 10 days' treatment with T or P4: 40 and 12%, respectively, in the ovary and 35 and 40%, respectively, in the oviduct. Ten days' treatment with T reduced PBR specific binding in the uterus by 25%, but the same interval of treatment with P4 did not alter specific binding in the uterus. Four or 10 days' treatment with DES significantly increased PBR specific binding in the ovary (1.5-fold), oviduct (2.4-fold), and uterus (1.9-fold). Scatchard analysis revealed that the changes in the PBR specific binding were due to a change in PBR density values rather than PBR affinity values. No change in PBR specific binding was found in the kidney following any of these treatments. Taken together, it is suggested that PBR density in the ovary is altered by exogenously administered steroids that usually are biosynthesized in the ovary. Additionally, the altered PBR density in the oviduct and uterus via the various steroids employed may imply that changes occurring in ovarian steroidogenesis should affect PBR density in these organs.", 
    "74": "The role of the cholinergic pathway in the vagus nerve in modulating gastric lesion formation by ethanol was examined, using an ex-vivo stomach chamber preparation. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly increased the lesion areas but lowered acid secretion and gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF). Atropine had no effect, whereas pirenzepine antagonized ethanol-induced mucosal damage. All three procedures showed similar potencies in depressing acid secretion, but only pirenzepine reversed the fall in the GMBF produced by ethanol. These differential effects of vagotomy, atropine and pirenzepine on gastric function suggest that the cholinergic component in the vagus nerve may not be important in the formation of ethanol-induced gastric damage. The persistent protective action as well as the restoration of ethanol-induced GMBF drop by pirenzepine in vagotomized animals further support this hypothesis. The worsening effect of vagotomy is probably modulated by a non-cholinergic mechanism, the abolition of which makes the gastric mucosa more susceptible to damage by ethanol. The acid-independent protective action of pirenzepine and its influence on the GMBF, which were not exhibited by atropine, are indeed unique and perhaps may be attributed to this non-cholinergic pathway.",

Flumazenil was injected intravenously in a regimen of 0.3 mg in the first minute followed by alternate 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg doses every minute until a total dose of 1 mg was given or until the patients responded. Patients were divided into two groups based on their response to flumazenil: Group 1, responders and Group 2, non-responders. The hospital stay was shortened significantly and interventional procedures, such as CT of brain and endotracheal intubation, were rendered unnecessary in several patients in Group 1. The Group 1 patients had a more favourable outcome than that of Group 2. We concluded that flumazenil may serve as a useful tool in diagnosis and management of carefully selected patients with acute alteration of mental status.",

The proportions of high affinity site vary from 100% in the caudate/putamen to 0% in the pons/medulla. The selectivities are different from those measured by pirenzepine and are consistent with QNX exhibiting similar affinity for the M1, M3, and M4 receptors with lower affinity for the M2 receptor.

    "78": "Hepatocyte culture may represent an alternative to the use of animals to study drug detoxification by the liver. An ideal in vitro system should closely mimic the in vivo environment by providing continuous media perfusion and oxygenation, and should facilitate sampling of cells and culture media. To meet these criteria, a hollow fiber bioreactor seeded with isolated rat hepatocytes was developed and tested by measuring the formation of three products of the oxidative metabolism of diazepam and the glucuronidation of phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP). To compare the performance of conventional monolayer culture to that of the bioreactor system, diazepam metabolism was studied for 45 days in both systems. The oxygen dependency of diazepam metabolism was evaluated by perfusing the bioreactor in an oxygen-rich atmosphere (30%). Total diazepam metabolism was twofold higher in the O2-rich perfused hollow fiber cultures than in the cultures perfused under normal conditions, reflecting an increase in temazepam and oxazepam production. Diazepam detoxification activity was significantly enhanced by oxygen (P < or = 0.001) over the life of the perfused cultures. PSP metabolism was similar in all three culture systems. By Day 10, diazepam metabolism in the oxygenated bioreactor system was 44% of the in vivo activity of rat hepatocytes. This activity dropped to 30% by Day 25 of culture. These results justify the use of perfused culture systems for in vitro detoxification studies as an alternative to animal use and emphasize the capacity of a culture device perfused under O2-enriched conditions to maintain long-term P450 activity of rat hepatocytes.", 
    "79": "Thirty-seven male alcoholics admitted electively for detoxification were randomized to treatment with either diazepam or propranolol. Subjects were comparable both in age and in duration and quantity of alcohol consumed. Admission laboratory parameters did not distinguish between the groups.

None of the subjects randomized to diazepam manifested withdrawal seizures or hallucinations. By contrast, one subject in the propranolol group had a single withdrawal seizure. Another subject manifested increasing withdrawal that required parenteral paraldehyde treatment. Thus, this study confirms that a significant number of subjects admitted electively for alcohol withdrawal can be managed without medication. Minor tranquilizers still remain the \"gold standard\" for management of the withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "80": "Poor sleep is a common complaint, accounting for 4-5% of all general practitioner consultations. Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation. Zolpidem (an imidazoypridine), one such agent, seems to provide an effective treatment for insomnia without inducing undesirable side-effects.", 
    "81": "Anticholinergic drugs suppress nocturnal and exercise-related growth hormone (GH) secretion in Type 1 diabetes; nocturnal GH suppression is associated with a fall in fasting plasma glucose levels. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of GH suppression on glucose levels following a period of meals and exercise in physiological pattern. Six Type 1 diabetic men recruited from the outpatient clinic were studied in random order at least 1 week apart. After an overnight fast subjects received two-thirds of their usual subcutaneous insulin and either 200 mg oral pirenzepine or placebo at time 0 min. Between 90 and 120 min subjects exercised continuously on an ergometric cycle. Standard meals or snacks were eaten at 30, 150, 270, and 390 min. Venous blood was collected from an indwelling cannula between 0 and 570 min. The mean incremental rise in plasma glucose after breakfast (delta peak/90 min) was 2.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SEM mmol l-1 (pirenzepine) vs 4.5 +/- 0.8 (placebo)), p < 0.05. Following exercise the fall in plasma glucose (delta gluc90-240 min) was 6.4 +/- 1.9 (pirenzepine) vs 2.0 +/- 1.3 (placebo), p < 0.005. The exercise-related peak rise in GH was 12.6 +/- 3.3 (pirenzepine) vs 28.5 +/- 6.0 mU l-1 (placebo), p = 0.08. Excluding one outlying result there was an inverse correlation between the integrated exercise-related increase in GH between 90 and 240 min and the fall in glucose over the corresponding time period (n = 11, r = -0.75, p = 0.008).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "The purpose of our study was to quantify the blood-retinal barrier permeability in five patients with insulin-dependent diabetic (mean age 14.96 +/- 2.45 years) without retinopathy, after six month with oral pirenzepine, a growth hormone inhibitor. Blood-retinal barrier permeability was determined by vitreous fluorophotometry before and after treatment with a nocturnal oral dose of pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg the first month and 1 mg/kg the following five months). We found a significant diminution (p < 0.05) in growth hormone levels (10.48 +/- 4.94 ng/ml before treatment and 4.35 +/- 2.53 ng/ml after treatment), nevertheless, no changes in the blood-retinal barrier permeability values were observed (4.84 +/- 2.08 x 10(-6) min-1 before treatment and 4.53 +/- 2.54 x 10(-6) min-1 after treatment). We found no modifications in the levels of somatomedin C or HbA1c either. It can be concluded that oral pirenzepine used at this dose for six months, in spite of a significant decrease in growth hormone secretion, does not decrease the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier.", 
    "83": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are administered to patients for acute and long-term treatment of seizures. Most patients with acute convulsions receive intravenous (i.v.) benzodiazepine (BZD), frequently followed by i.v. loading with phenytoin (PHT), especially when seizures continue. For patients with absence status epilepticus, BZD is usually followed by ethosuximide (ESM) or valproate (VPA). The decision to continue AED therapy is based on the likelihood that seizures will continue or recur. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, long-term treatment with AEDs is recommended, beginning with monotherapy. Two studies sponsored by the U.S. Veterans Administration (VA), which compared the efficacy of carbamazepine (CBZ), PHT, phenobarbital (PB), primidone (PRM), and VPA, recommend that most adults with recurrent partial seizures receive either CBZ or PHT. The 1992 VA study suggests that VPA is equal to CBZ or PHT in efficacy when partial seizures become secondarily generalized. Primary generalized epilepsies are most frequently treated with VPA when combinations of generalized seizures exist. ESM is prescribed most often when typical childhood absence seizures exist alone. Although many authorities do not recommend long-term treatment of childhood febrile seizures, PB is administered by some when febrile seizures have complex symptomatology. In general, AED monotherapy is currently preferred, but those with more refractory epilepsy receive polytherapy. CBZ, PHT, PB, PRM, VPA, and ESM are the primary AEDs prescribed in the United States. PHT, followed by CBZ and VPA, is the most frequently prescribed AED as both new and total prescriptions. The introduction of felbamate, gabapentin,and lamotrigine may alter these patterns in the future.", 
    "84": "Whereas the main clinical problem in drug addiction lies in individual vulnerability to toxicomania, experimental models of drug abuse usually focus on the brain targets involved in the reinforcing properties of drugs. In this short review, we describe the two main procedures of animal drug self-administration--retention and acquisition paradigms--designed to investigate the neural substrate of drug abuse and the individual susceptibility to toxicomania. Retention procedures have been widely employed since Weeks (1962) to study the reinforcing properties of various addictive substances in experimental animals, particularly opiates and psychostimulants. If the meso-accumbens dopaminergic pathway actually seems to underlie the reinforcing properties of psychostimulants, the question remains unsolved regarding opiates and other drugs of abuse such as benzodiazepines, nicotine or alcohol. Rather than a final common pathway for the reinforcing properties of drugs, the dopaminergic system could be considered as a modulator which enables the expression of addictive properties, supported by the interaction of drugs with other brain structures. Therefore, the neural substrate of drug reinforcement appears redundant and widespread rather than convergent and anatomically circumscribed. On the other hand, acquisition procedures deal with factors that influence the individual vulnerability to drug addiction in animals. This procedure measures the ability of animals to become dependent of low doses of addictive substances. Under various conditions such as stress, food deprivation or isolated housing, it is possible to detect changes in the vulnerability to drug consumption. Moreover, it is possible to detect behavioral characteristics that predict the vulnerability of animals to the spontaneous self-administration of psychostimulants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "The modulating influence of preliminary activation of the delta-opiate receptors on retrieval and retention of the memory trace during the blockade of various components of GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex in a passive avoidance paradigm was studied in mice. The psychogenic amnesia was caused by a detention of a mouse in the dangerous compartment. Bicuculline (1 mg/kg), picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) and flumazenil (10 mg/kg) injected prior to testing attenuated the retrieval deficit caused by amnesia. Pretraining administration of leu-enkephalin (0.2 mg/kg) facilitated the efficiency of the action of the blockade of benzodiazepine receptors on the retrieval of the passive avoidance response whereas the blockade of GABA-A receptors and chloride channels was non-effective. These experiments provide additional support for the hypothesis that \"neurochemical set\" plays an important role of a regulator determining the neurochemical interaction between opiate receptor and GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex in modulating memory processes.", 
    "86": "In the paper were studied the rats' individual circadian locomotor activity rhythm patterns and their day and night time sensitivity to hexobarbital sodium and diazepam. Pinealectomy without altering the rhythm patterns significantly increased their amplitude and enhanced the hypnotic effect of hexobarbital both in the daytime and at night and that of diazepam only in the daytime. The animal rhythm patterns and the circadian variations of their sensitivity to the hypnotic drugs were suggested to depend on the individual variations of the pineal activity.", 
    "87": "Current pharmacotherapeutic approaches to the management of violent and aggressive behavior rely mostly on agents that act as receptor agonists or antagonists at subtypes of brain dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic receptors. Ethological experimental studies in animals have shown that drugs may modulate aggression by inhibiting motor activity, by distorting aggression-provoking or -inhibiting signals, by fragmenting behavioral sequences or temporal patterning, or by increasing the rate and intensity of aggressive acts. Evidence from animal studies points to large changes in selected brain dopamine, serotonin, and GABA systems during and following aggressive and defensive behavior. However, the specificity of drugs that are currently used to control aggressive behavior through their action as agonists or antagonists at subtypes of dopamine, serotonin or GABA receptors continues to be of concern. Similar to the effects of widely used traditional neuroleptics that nonselectively antagonize dopamine receptors, the range of behaviors which is suppressed by either D1 or D2 receptor antagonists is pervasive. At present, systemic administration of dopamine receptor antagonists in animal preparations does not target aggression-specific mechanisms. The GABAA/Benzodiazepine/Chloride ionophore receptor complex is implicated in the aggression-heightening effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines. Although early reports focused on the \"taming\" effects of benzodiazepine anxiolytics, low doses may enhance aggression in both animals and humans. Benzodiazepine antagonists block heightened aggression after low doses of alcohol or benzodiazepines. Agonists at certain 5-HT1 receptor subtypes such as eltoprazine are potently effective in reducing aggressive behavior of males and females of various animal species under conditions that promote charging offensive-type aggression, without adversely affecting nonaggressive components of the behavioral repertoire. However, recent reports indicate that eltoprazine and related compounds may potentiate anxiety reactions in rodents, and question the behavioral specificity of these substances. Opioid receptor antagonists modulate primarily physiological and behavioral responses of defense and submission. Defeated animals show tolerance to opiate analgesia and withdrawal responses upon challenge with opioid receptor antagonists. Defensive and submissive vocalizations are potently blocked by opioid peptides. Substances that target specific receptor subtypes at serotonergic, GABAergic and opioidergic synapses are most promising for the selective modification of aggressive, defensive and submissive behavior patterns.", 
    "88": "Within a double-blind, comparative study on the effects of the long-half-life benzodiazepine (BDZ), quazepam, and the short-half-life BDZ, triazolam, on clinical symptomatology, sleep and anxiety of 45 patients with insomnia based on a mild to moderate generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (ICD-9 code: 307.42-1, 300,0; ASDC-APSS-Code: A.2.a), we compared, in a first step at baseline, drug-free polysomnographic and psychometric data of 22 patients recorded in the laboratory (L-group) and 21 patients recorded by the Oxford Medilog 9000 system at home (H-group) with those of normal controls. Sleep efficiency, total sleep time, wake within total sleep period (middle insomnia) and wake before buzzer (late insomnia) were significantly deteriorated in both patient groups as compared with controls, while sleep induction time only differed significantly in home recordings. Regarding sleep architecture, stage (S)2 was reduced, S3 and S4 increased in the H-group only, while no intergroup differences were seen in S1, SREM and REM latency. Subjective sleep quality was reduced in both patient groups, but not awakening quality. Psychometric tests in the morning demonstrated for the noopsyche, only a significantly deteriorated psychomotor activity in both patient groups. In the thymopsyche, evening well-being and mood in the morning were reduced in both the L- and H-group, affectivity and morning well-being only in the H-group. The psychopharmacological part of the study was completed by 40 patients (there were 4 drop-outs in the triazolam, 1 in the quazepam group). They were treated after 1 week placebo with either 15-30 mg (median 15 mg) quazepam or 0.25-0.5 mg (median 0.25 mg) triazolam for 4 weeks, and thereafter for 2 weeks with placebo. Anxiety (rated by HAMA and SAS) improved significantly with both drugs and remained improved throughout 2 weeks post-drug placebo, with quazepam being slightly superior to triazolam. Polysomnography demonstrated a shortened sleep onset only after quazepam. Sleep efficiency improved after acute administration of both drugs, but the improvement was maintained by quazepam only (tolerance development with triazolam). Rebound insomnia was observed only in the 1st post-triazolam placebo night (significant intergroup difference based on confirmatory testing). S2 increased, S3 + S4 decreased under and after quazepam, which represents a normalization in home-recorded GAD patients. S1 decreased with both drugs, SREM only under quazepam. Subjective sleep quality behaved very similarly to objective sleep efficiency. Awakening quality improved after acute therapy with both drugs, somatic complaints only with quazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "89": "Diazepam (DZ) and scopolamine (SCP) are known to be beneficial when each is used in combination with atropine (AT) + oxime therapy against intoxication by soman, but the efficacy of each might be expected to vary with the dosage of AT. Thus the therapeutic efficacy of SCP (5 doses; 0-0.86 mg/kg) versus DZ (5 doses; 0-5 mg/kg), when used in conjunction with AT (3 doses; 0.5-8 mg/kg) + 2-PAM (25 mg/kg) therapy, was tested in groups of pyridostigmine pretreated guinea pigs exposed to 1.6, 2.0, 2.5 or 3.2 LD50s of soman. Response surface methodology was employed to describe the relationship between lethality and the AT/DZ or AT/SCP dosages. Results show that within the indicated dose ranges used, the efficacy of SCP is not dependent on the presence of AT, whereas AT is needed for DZ to maintain the lowest probability of death. These findings suggest that in guinea pigs SCP could supplement AT or replace DZ as therapy against nerve agent intoxication.", 
    "90": "The present study was performed to determine the metabolic fate of the residues of diazepam and its metabolites in an in vivo model and using two different animal species, guinea pigs and rats, successively. Guinea pigs were orally dosed with diazepam at 100 mg/kg bw and 10 mg/kg bw. After 2 h the animals were sacrificed and their livers were removed. Rats were fed these livers and sacrificed 8 h later after having ingested the portion given. Blood, kidney, and liver of rats were collected to quantify drug residues. Oxazepam and demethyldiazepam were identified by HPLC-UV in liver and kidney rat extracts and also in some blood samples. Temazepam was only found in liver from rats that had eaten guinea pig liver dosed at the highest level. The identity of demethyldiazepam was confirmed in rat liver extracts by GC-MS. This study demonstrates the bioavailability of diazepam metabolites in a second animal (rat simulating a consumer) following a diazepam administration to a first animal (guinea pigs simulating a target animal). Residue concentrations were reduced from 9.7 and 243 micrograms in consumed guinea pig liver to 3.75 and 455 ng/g in rat liver for parent drug and oxazepam, the lowest and highest residues found, respectively.", 
    "91": "Gastrin-17 stimulated growth of the human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 but not of the human colon carcinoma cell lines T84, HCT116 and the mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1. Correspondingly, specific gastrin binding sites were only found on HT29-cells. Proglumide, loxiglumide and L-365,260 inhibited gastrin-17 stimulated growth of HT29-cells at doses which did not influence cell growth when given without gastrin. At higher concentrations proglumide and loxiglumide reduced cell proliferation in all cell lines investigated. Gastrin-17 could not reverse these effects. This growth inhibition was therefore considered as not gastrin receptor mediated. The results demonstrate that only some human colon carcinoma cell lines are stimulated by gastrin. This stimulation can be inhibited by gastrin/CCK-antagonists.", 
    "92": "The clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging and neurophysiological findings of eight patients with stiff man syndromes (SMS) [four of six being tested with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)] are presented. In two patients (one GAD-positive, one GAD-negative), transient oculomotor disturbances suggested progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) as differential diagnosis. The catalogue of characteristic clinical symptoms of SMS is extended by three new symptoms: (1) an aura-like feeling reported by five patients to precede spontaneous spasmodic attacks; (2) a stereotyped motor pattern seen in seven patients during spasmodic jerks, consisting of brief opisthotonos, stiffening of the slightly abducted legs and inversion of the plantar-flexed feet; (3) a paroxysmal fear when crossing a free space unaided, or even thinking of it. Clinical findings did not enable us to discriminate between patients tested GAD-positive or GAD-negative. Cerebrospinal fluid contained elevated immunoglobulin levels or cell counts, or both, in the majority of patients. Autopsy of one patient revealed scattered lymphocyte cuffs around leptomeningeal, intracerebral and particularly intraspinal vessels, suggesting a mild inflammatory process. Whether SMS and PERM are closely related is discussed; they are possibly both manifestations of a spectrum of encephalomyelopathies having autoimmunity against GABAergic neurons in common.", 
    "93": "Under barrier condition and with ad lib access to food and water, 20 Fischer-344 rats were chronically treated for 10 months with the benzodiazepine (BDZ) antagonist, flumazenil (FL; 4 mg/kg/day in drinking water acidified to pH = 3.0), beginning at the age of 13 months, while the group of 20 control age-matched rats received plain acidified water. The life span of the first 8 deceased rats treated with FL was significantly longer than that of the first 8 deceased rats in the age-matched control group. In tests for spontaneous ambulation and exploratory behavior in the Holeboard apparatus, conducted during the 3rd and the 8th month of treatment, the FL group, relative to controls, had significantly higher scores for the ambulation and exploratory behavior. In tests for unrewarded spontaneous alternation in the T maze, conducted at days 7, 39, 42, and 47 through 54 after drug withdrawal, i.e., at the age of 24-25 months, the FL-exposed group, compared to age-matched controls, showed a significantly higher percent of alternating choices, a behavior that was statistically comparable to that of the \"young\" 6-month-old controls. In the Radial Maze tests conducted 2 months after drug withdrawal, the FL group made significantly less \"working memory\" errors and \"reference memory\" errors, relative to the age-matched 25-month-old control group, a performance that was comparable to that of the young 7-month-old control group. In conclusion, chronic FL significantly protected rats from age-related loss of cognitive functions. It is postulated that the age-related alterations in brain function may be attributable to the negative metabolic/trophic influences of the \"endogenous\" benzodiazepine (BDZ) ligands and/or those ingested with food. A BDZ/GABAergic hypothesis of brain aging has been formulated which assumes that age-related and abnormally strong BDZ/GABAergic influences promote neurodegeneration by suppressing trophic functions of the aminergic and peptidergic neurons through opening of chloride channels in soma membrane and axon terminals, causing excessive hyperpolarizing and depolarizing inhibition, respectively. The review of human clinical and animal data indicates that FL has nootropic actions by enhancing vigilance cognitive and habituation processes.", 
    "94": "The results of a preliminary evaluation of etorphine/methotrimeprazine ('Small Animal Immobilon') and midazolam in rats and mice are reported, and this regimen is compared to fentanyl/fluanisone/midazolam in mice. In rats, a surgical plane of anaesthesia with good muscle relaxation was produced, but blood gas analysis showed the presence of severe hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis. In mice etorphine/methotrimeprazine/midazolam and fentanyl/fluanisone/midazolam produced adequate anaesthesia, but blood gas analysis showed severe respiratory depression with both regimens. Since etorphine/methotrimeprazine/midazolam produced severe respiratory depression in rats and mice it is suggested that this regimen is used with caution. Administration of supplemental oxygen would seem advisable when using either etorphine/methotrimeprazine/midazolam or fentanyl/fluanisone/midazolam in rats and mice.", 
    "95": "Lissencephaly syndromes are rare disturbances of the neuronal migration with agyria and/or pachygyria. Typical patterns in the EEG of 5 children with lissencephaly are presented. Rhythmic alpha- or beta-waves with high amplitudes of diffuse or fronto-precentral localisation are characteristic in type I lissencephaly. In type II lissencephaly initially theta- or delta-waves of somewhat lower amplitude are observed. Sharp and slow wave-complexes of very high amplitude are found more often in type I lissencephaly. They seem to correlate with the severity of the brain malformation and the epilepsy. In both types of lissencephaly the spatial organisation of the background activity and the sleep-wake differentiation are absent. The EEG of most type I lissencephalies show no reactivity to intravenous benzodiazepines. With increasing age the frequency of the background activity and of the high amplitude rhythmic waves decrease in type I and increase in type II lissencephaly. A complete dedifferentiation of the EEG tracings has been observed in the course of type I lissencephaly. Lissencephaly is diagnosed by imaging techniques. However, with a high probability lissencephaly can be suspected already by its EEG.",

Predictors of response to placebo were weaker and, in addition to lower levels anxiety and panic attacks, included a lack of previous psychiatric treatment.", 
    "97": "The effect of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, on the basic metabolic activity was investigated in the mouse brain and was correlated with its receptor occupancy. For the quantitative evaluation of the functional activity of the mouse brain, the cerebral glucose utilization was measured by the double tracer technique, using [14C] 2-deoxyglucose and [3H]3-O-methylglucose. The dose-dependent reduction in the cerebral glucose utilization was observed after intravenous administration of various doses of muscimol (0.3-1.5 mg/kg). On the other hand, the GABAA receptor occupancy of muscimol was determined by using the values of the unbound drug concentration in the brain tissue and the receptor dissociation constant based on the in vitro binding experiments using the dissociated brain cells. The tissue unbound concentration of muscimol was calculated by multiplying the total concentration in the brain after administration of muscimol and the tissue unbound fraction, which was measured by the equilibrium dialysis method using brain tissue homogenate. A linear relationship was observed between the GABAA receptor occupancy of muscimol and the decrease in the cerebral glucose utilization. This finding indicates that the simple receptor occupancy theory holds for this receptor-ligand system, and there is a large difference in the effect on glucose metabolic response between GABAA receptor-agonist interaction and benzodiazepine receptor-agonist interaction.", 
    "98": "Benzodiazepine receptors are allosteric modulatory sites on GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors are probably composed of five protein subunits, at least some of which belong to different subunit classes. So far six alpha-, four beta-, three gamma-, and delta- and two rho = p subunits of GABAA receptors have been identified. A large number of different subunit combinations, each of which will result in a GABAA receptor with distinct electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, are therefore possible. Many compounds from different chemical classes which are able to bind to benzodiazepine receptors have been identified. Depending on their individual efficacy, binding of these compounds either enhances, reduces or does not influence GABAergic transmission. However, the individual efficacy of the benzodiazepine receptor ligands changes with the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor. The investigation of the regional distribution, subunit composition and pharmacology of GABAA receptors will result in the development of new and more selective compounds for psychiatry.",

[3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was used as an index of cell proliferation. It was found that tested peripheral- and mixed-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands significantly suppressed the pituitary cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (10(-4)-10(-8) M). The inhibitory effect of Ro 5-4864 was reversed by 5 x 10(-3) M calcium chloride. On the other hand, central-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands suppressed tumor cell proliferation only at the highest concentration studied (10(-4) M). Our results indicate that benzodiazepines might exert an antiproliferative action on pituitary tumor cell growth, and that this effect seems to be a calcium-dependent process.", 
    "100": "The determination of the major urinary compounds of eight common benzodiazepines, flunitrazepam, diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, bromazepam, temazepam, oxazepam, and lorazepam, by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) is shown to be a simple and attractive approach for confirmation testing of these drugs in human urine. After enzymatic hydrolysis and extraction using mixed-mode solid-phase cartridges and a two-step elution protocol, fractions were analyzed in a phosphate/borate buffer (pH 9.3) containing 75 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate and small amounts of isopropanol, methanol and/or acetonitrile using an instrument with on- column multi-wavelength detection. The presence of these compounds could unambiguously be confirmed in patient urines which tested positive for benzodiazepines using a commercial enzyme multiplied immunoassay screening technique (EMIT). The sensitivity of the MECC assay is demonstrated to be better than that of EMIT. MECC analysis of one patient urine which tested negatively employing EMIT revealed the presence of lorazepam, this demonstrating that false-negative results from the initial immunological screening process can be recognized using MECC. For one example, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, the MECC data are shown to agree well with those obtained by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.",

    "110": "Relatively few clinically significant drug interactions with anaesthetics have been documented in the literature. The following should be stressed since these interactions are not readily predictable or are potentially fatal. Pethidine should never be administered to patients who have received monamine oxidase inhibiting drugs within the last fortnight, since a fatal hyperpyrexia and/or hypertension may result. Thiopentone induction seems to make the heart more susceptible to arrhythmias caused by adrenergic drugs, and may cause severe arterial hypotension in patients treated with diazoxide. Midazolam orally should possibly be avoided as premedication in patients treated with erythromycin since anaesthetic concentrations of midazolam may result. Patients for whom bupivacaine analgesia is planned could preferentially be premedicated with other drugs than diazepam, which causes the serum level of bupivacaine to increase. Bradycardia and hypotension not attributable to sympathetic blockade have been reported following bupivacaine extradurally in verapamil-treated patients. Sulfonamides and the ester group of local anaesthetics, such as prilocaine in combination, may result in severe methaemoglobinaemia in infants. Epinephrine added to local anaesthetics may cause local vasodilation if administered to patients concurrently being treated with cyclic antidepressants, and the combination imposes the risk of severe hypertension and arrhythmias.",

This phenomenon is called stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH). We varied several experimental parameters to elucidate the mechanism behind this SIH. SIH was stable and found by all technicians performing the experiments. The large intertechnician difference in the mean rectal temperature could be eliminated by training in an identical fixation and handling technique. SIH was both independent of the number of handling days preceding the experiment and of the number of disturbances (0, 1, 2, or 5) implied on the mice per minute. The percentage of hyperthermic mice in 10-mice cages increased when the time interval between the individual measurements increased from 1 to 2, 5 or 10 min.

Because of the partial solubility of amylodextrin, drug release was lower than the release from drug-cyclodextrin complexes. Use of the soluble fraction of amylodextrin for both the solid dispersion and the complex further enhanced drug release, but it was still below that of drug-cyclodextrin complexes.", 
    "113": "The effects of chronic pentobarbital (PB) treatment on the binding characteristics of [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) in rat brain were examined. Saline or sodium PB (500 micrograms/10 microliters/hr) was infused into the lateral cerebral ventricles of rats for 6 days using osmotic pumps. Immediately before withdrawal, there were no significant differences in [3H]FLU binding constants (KD and Bmax) between saline and PB groups. However, 24 hr withdrawal caused an increase in Bmax with no changes in KD. The enhancement of [3H]FLU binding by in vitro addition of chloride ions and PB was not affected after the PB infusion. The PB enhancement of [3H]FLU binding was inhibited by the convulsant, picrotoxinin. PB withdrawal did not cause significant differences in the binding constants of [3H]Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist, between the saline and PB groups. Pretreatment of membranes with 0.02 mM of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1- propanesulfonate (CHAPS), a zwitterionic detergent, caused decreases in both KD and Bmax in FLU binding in PB-withdrawal membrane, but not in the saline-treated membrane. The enhancement of [3H]FLU binding by chloride ions and PB was not affected by the CHAPS treatment. These results suggest that the change in BZ receptors induced by PB withdrawal is functionally linked to the GABA-BZ-barbiturate receptor complex and that PB withdrawal induces some conformational changes in BZ receptors.", 
    "114": "To investigate the mechanism of penicillin-induced convulsions, we have studied the effects of penicillin G (PC-G) on GABA-gated chloride ion influx in brain 'microsac' preparations of mice. In the presence of 10(-4) M GABA, PC-G inhibited GABA-gated chloride ion influx in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-response curve for GABA in the presence of 10(-3) M PC-G was shifted rightward and there was a decrease in maximum response. The inhibitory effects of PC-G were not reversed by RO 15-1788, an antagonist of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, but were reversed by washing the 'microsac' membranes. Therefore, PC-G probably exerts its proconvulsant effect by inhibiting GABA-gated chloride ion influx. However, it appears not to act through the BZ receptor of the GABA/BZ receptor complex.", 
    "115": "The selectivity of carbon monoxide binding to specific human cytochrome P450 isozymes was investigated by studying its inhibition of prototype reactions for 3 major drug metabolizing P450s in liver microsomes: dextromethorphan O-demethylation and (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (P450DB1, CYP2D6), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation (P450TB, CYP2C subfamily), and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (P450NF, CYP3A subfamily). The affinity of carbon monoxide is different for each P450 isozyme. Warburg partition coefficients were 0.35, 1.1 and 3.9 microM for P450DB1, P450TB and P450NF, respectively. Differential inhibition by carbon monoxide may be a useful tool to identify specific human cytochrome P450 isozymes in the early screening of drug biotransformation catalysts. Further studies involving other P450 isozymes and substrates should extend our understanding of the phenomena and their implications."
