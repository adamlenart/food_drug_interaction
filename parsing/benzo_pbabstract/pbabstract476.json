The patients had had affective disorder (chiefly bipolar disorder) for an average of 31 years. Most had been hospitalized at the state hospital for several years. Previous unsuccessful treatments had included lithium, carbamazepine, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy in one patient. After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, valproate led to marked improvement in three patients, moderate improvement in two, minimal improvement in one, and no change in one patient with delusional depression. Global Assessment Scale scores increased over baseline an average of 29 points (p = .01). Valproate proved to be safe in these older individuals, many of whom had several medical conditions.", 
    "1": "The syntheses as well as 5-HT and Benzodiazepine receptor binding studies of some 1,2,4-Triazolo[4',3':1,6]piridazino[4,5-b]quinoline and 2,3-Dihydro-9-phenyl-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinoline-1-one derivatives are reported. While the triazole-containing heterocycles are devoid of any biological activity, 2-benzyl-2,3-dihydro-9-phenyl-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinoline-1-one shows some affinity for the central type of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "2": "1. The pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepine receptor ligand, FG 8205 (7-chloro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-3-(5-isopropyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol++ +-3-yl)-4H- imidazol[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazepine) have been examined. 2. FG 8205 potently displaced [3H]-flumazenil binding in rat cortical membranes with a Ki of 3.3 nM, but was inactive at 13 neurotransmitter recognition sites. 3. Consistent with a partial agonist profile, the affinity of FG 8205 for the benzodiazepine recognition site was increased in the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 300 microM) by a degree (-log [IC50 in the presence of GABA/IC50 alone] = 0.34) significantly less than found for diazepam (0.46). FG 8205 also potentiated the inhibitory potency of the GABAA-receptor agonist, isoguvacine, on the hippocampal CA1 population spike and, again, the maximum shift (-log dose-ratio = 0.2) was significantly less than that seen with diazepam (0.4). 4. In anticonvulsant studies, the ED50 doses of FG 8205 and diazepam needed to antagonize seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or by sound in audiogenic seizure prone mice were similar with values of 0.2-0.3 mg kg-1, i.p. However, even high doses of FG 8205 (50 mg kg-1) did not protect against seizures induced by electroshock. 5. FG 8205 released responding suppressed by footshock in a rat operant conditioned emotional response task over the dose range 0.5-50 mg kg-1 (i.p.). Similar doses of FG 8205 had a marked taming effect in cynomolgus monkeys. However, measures of sedation and ataxia (as measured by rotarod in the mouse, climbing behaviour in the rat, and by scoring arousal and co-ordination in primates) were slight and only transiently affected by FG 8205, and FG 8205 significantly antagonized the rotarod performance deficit induced by diazepam in the mouse. 6. While the potentiation by FG 8205 of the response to isoguvacine in the rat hippocampal slice and the anxiolytic-like effects of the compound in both rats and primates were reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, high doses of the antagonist were able only marginally to block the protective effects of FG 8205 against seizures induced by PTZ in the mouse. 7. Thus, FG 8205 does not show the marked motor impairment characteristic of full agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor, consistent with its partial agonist profile in in vitro assay systems. Nevertheless, the compound has sufficient intrinsic activity to maintain high efficacy in anticonvulsant and anxiolytic tests.", 
    "3": "1. The effects of the calcium channel blocking agent, nitrendipine, were studied on seizures in mice produced during withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepine treatment and on the development of tolerance to benzodiazepines. 2. Nitrendipine produced a dose-dependent decrease in seizure incidence, when seizures were produced by the partial inverse agonist FG7142 during withdrawal from seven days treatment with flurazepam. 3. Nitrendipine did not raise the seizure thresholds in na\u00efve mice to the full inverse agonist methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), or to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist, bicuculline. 4. When given concurrently with flurazepam for seven days, nitrendipine did not affect the incidence of seizures during flurazepam withdrawal. 5. When given concurrently with the benzodiazepines, nitrendipine did not prevent the development of tolerance to midazolam general anaesthesia or tolerance to the ataxic actions of flurazepam or midazolam. 6. Chronic treatment with flurazepam for seven days did not affect the Kd or Bmax of [3H]-nimodipine binding in mouse whole brain or cerebral cortex. 7. These results with benzodiazepines are partially in contrast with those for ethanol, where nitrendipine not only decreased ethanol withdrawal seizures when given acutely, but also prevented the development of tolerance and withdrawal signs when given concurrently with ethanol. However, they do confirm the selectivity of nitrendipine for withdrawal-induced seizures.", 
    "4": "1. Chronic administration of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 has previously been shown to induce seizure activity in mice. In the present study we have investigated the effects of acute and chronic treatment with FG 7142 in mice on the levels of acetylcholinesterase activity in cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and striatum. We have also investigated the effects of acute and chronic stress in the form of handling (vehicle-injection) on acetylcholinesterase levels. 2. A single dose of FG 7142 produced a marked elevation of total acetylcholinesterase activities in the hippocampus and midbrain when compared with vehicle-injected control levels, but the levels were not different from those in unhandled animals. 3. Acute stress, in the form of vehicle-injection produced decreases in cortical and hippocampal soluble acetylcholinesterase activity but FG 7142 had no effect upon these stress-induced changes. 4. Total cortical and hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activities were increased by 56% and 16% respectively in the chronic FG 7142-treated mice that exhibited seizure activity (compared with vehicle-injected controls). 5. Soluble acetylcholinesterase activity in the midbrain was decreased to 82% of control levels only in animals that had undergone FG 7142-induced kindling. Smaller or no changes in acetylcholinesterase activity in the midbrain were observed in chronically FG 7142-treated animals that exhibited no seizure activity. 6. Mice that did not demonstrate seizure activity in response to chronic FG 7142 treatment showed alterations in the soluble acetylcholinesterase activities of the hippocampus and midbrain. 7. It is concluded that chronic treatment with the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 produces alterations in the acetylcholinesterase activities of various brain regions, in a manner related to the kindling that can be produced by this treatment. 8. Chronic mild stress, in the form of repeated handling (vehicle injection), induced changes in brain activity with decreases in total activity occurring in the cortex and hippocampus, and an increase in soluble acetylcholinesterase activity occurring in the midbrain. 9. All these stress-induced changes appeared to be prevented by administration of FG 7142 at the time of the stress. It would appear therefore that FG 7142 can prevent the effects of chronic stress on brain acetylcholinesterase activity.", 
    "5": "Quinidine has multiple electrophysiologic effects, including prolongation of ventricular conduction time, repolarization, and refractoriness. The purpose of this study was to address the relative contributions of these electrophysiologic effects to the enhanced anti-arrhythmic activity observed when quinidine is combined with mexiletine. We compared antiarrhythmic and electrophysiologic effects observed when quinidine or its stereoisomer quinine were combined with mexiletine. Quinine and quinidine both prolong conduction time; however, these agents have divergent effects on ventricular repolarization time and refractoriness. The modest prolongation of conduction time observed with quinine and mexiletine-quinine in the absence of change of ventricular refractoriness was not associated with antiarrhythmic efficacy. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of mexiletine-quinidine exceeds that of mexiletine-quinine, suggesting that the ability of quinidine to prolong refractoriness and repolarization contributes to the antiarrhythmic efficacy of mexiletine-quinidine. Although, both the mexiletine-quinidine combination and quinidine monotherapy prolonged refractoriness to a similar extent, the mexiletine-quinidine combination produced greater antiarrhythmic efficacy and prolonged interventricular conduction within the periinfarct zone to an extent greater than did quinidine alone. We concluded that the role of quinidine in producing enhanced antiarrhythmic activity when combined with mexiletine includes both prolongation of refractoriness and conduction time in the periinfarct zone.", 
    "6": "The behavioral effects of an acute subconvulsant dose of the insecticide and ectoparasiticide gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, lindane, were compared in the plus-maze ((+)-maze) animal model of anxiety to those elicited by the anxiogenic GABAA-antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam. The effects of the coadministration of diazepam and lindane, and of diazepam and PTZ were also studied. The results from the analysis of the data with the multivariate statistical technique principal component analysis indicated that the effects of subconvulsant doses of lindane and PTZ on the behavior of rats in the (+)-maze are similar, and opposite to those elicited by diazepam, and that the administration of the convulsants would antagonize the effects of the benzodiazepine. The putative anxiogenic properties of the insecticide and the utility of the (+)-maze model in neurotoxicological research are discussed.", 
    "7": "Five children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (epilepsy, acquired aphasia, and continuous spike-wave discharges during sleep), were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), sleep-modifying drugs, and corticosteroids. The pharmacologic profiles differed from those observed in focal epilepsies, resembling instead those of certain generalized epilepsies, such as West or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Phenobarbital (PB), carbamazepine (CBZ), and phenytoin (PHT) were ineffective or worsened the EEG and neuropsychological symptoms, whereas valproate (VPA), ethosuximide (ESM), and benzodiazepines were partially or transiently efficacious. Dextroamphetamine produced a dramatic but transient improvement in waking and sleep EEG in one of two children; aphasia did not change. Corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved speech, suppression of seizures, and normalization of the EEG in three of three children. Our own experience and data from the literature suggest that corticosteroids should be given in high doses as soon as the diagnosis is firmly established and should be continued in maintenance dose for several months or years to avoid escape. Early diagnosis, before mutism or global deterioration develops, appears to be essential for effective therapy with minimal neuropsychological sequelae.", 
    "8": "Different combinations of cloned rat brain subunit isoforms of the GABAA receptor channel were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The voltage-clamp technique was then used to measure properties of the GABA-induced membrane currents and to study the effects of various modulators of the GABAA receptor channel (diazepam, DMCM, pentobarbital, and picrotoxin). This approach was used to obtain information on the minimal structural requirements for several functional properties of the ion channel. The combination alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 was identified as the minimal requirement reproducing consensus properties of the vertebrate GABAA receptor channel, including cooperativity of GABA-dependent channel gating with a Ka in the range of 10 microM, modulation by various drugs acting at the benzodiazepine binding site, picrotoxin sensitivity, and barbiturate effects.", 
    "9": "Streptomyces griseus and bacteriophage B were used for an assay system detecting anti-bacteriophage antibiotics. Streptomyces sp. RK-1441 was found to produce antibacteriophage antibiotics, RK-1441A and B, which are pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine group antibiotics related to neothramycin. Both RK-1441A and B had antibacteriophage activity. The former showed antimicrobial activity on a hypersensitive strain of E. coli for antitumor antibiotics, but the later did not show the activity. Restriction enzyme assay suggested that RK-1441A formed adducts with guanine residues in DNA strands. RK-1441B was not active in vitro, but it might be converted to the active form in host organisms.", 
    "10": "Antibacteriophage antibiotics, RK-1441A and B, related to neothramycin were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. and their structures were deduced from spectroscopic analyses. The structure of RK-1441A was 8,11-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxy-5-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,1-c:1,4]benzodiazepine. RK-1441B is a tautomeric mixture at C-3 of the structure, 3,8,11-trihydroxy-7-methoxy-5-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,1-c:1,4]benzodiazepine.", 
    "11": "Three sets of experiments were carried out with CD1 mice tested in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task. In a first set of experiments the posttraining administration of ethanol (1 or 2 g/kg) impaired, while that of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 (5 or 10, but not 2.5 mg/kg) improved the retention performance of the animals. In a second set of experiments a by itself ineffective dose of Ro 15-4513 (2.5 mg/kg) antagonized the effect of ethanol (1 and 2 kg/kg). These results are discussed on the basis of the interaction of these drugs with the GABAergic system. In a third set of experiments, in which the performances of mice familiarized with the apparatus were compared with those of non-familiarized mice, ethanol was less effective in impairing memory processes of the experienced subjects. These results are discussed in terms of attenuation of emotionality, resulting in impaired retention, following posttraining ethanol administration.", 
    "12": "GABAA receptors with functional benzodiazepine receptors have been reconstituted by coexpression of alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunit cDNAs. In brain, proteins of the alpha- and beta-subunits, but not the gamma 2-subunit have been identified. Using an antipeptide antiserum, we now demonstrate that the gamma 2-subunit is a protein of 43 kDa. It is present in at least 50% of GABAA receptors, as shown by immunoprecipitation.", 
    "13": "The GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the basal ganglia of primates treated with the neurotoxin n-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been studied by semi-quantitative autoradiography with [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ). Systemic treatment with MPTP produced a stable and lasting parkinsonian condition, with pronounced bradykinesia, akinesia and tremor. In the lateral segment of the globus pallidus (GPL) there was a significant reduction of [3H]FNZ binding compared with non-treated animals. There were no significant changes in the [3H]FNZ binding in the caudate nucleus, putamen and medial globus pallidus (GPM). This suggests that MPTP-treatment increases GABA release within the GPL exclusively. In view of the available evidence suggesting increased striatal output, and reduced unit activity within the GPL of the MPTP-treated primate, it seems likely that the striatal GABAergic output to the GPL is overactive in this model of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, as there is no evidence for a change in GABA function within the GPM using this measure, the striatal neurones which innervate the GPM may be differentially affected by loss of dopamine innervation. In line with structural evidence and extrastriatal dopamine receptor distribution this suggests that the two striatopallidal systems are functionally heterogeneous. A hemi-parkinsonian primate model has also been used in this study. This model was produced by injection of MPTP directly into one carotid artery. The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was destroyed on the injected side alone, and consequently the appearance of parkinsonian symptoms was confined to the contralateral side. [3H]FNZ binding in the GPL appears to be bilaterally reduced in this model, suggesting an interaction between the treated and non-treated side of the brain. In addition there is increased binding in the putamen and GPM with respect to the non-treated side of the brain. The increased [3H]FNZ binding in the GPM of the unilateral model may be due to the greater disruption of the nigropallidal and/or nigrostiatal dopamine neurones relative to the systemic model. The former would have the effect of uncoupling D1 dopamine receptors located on the terminals of striatal efferents from nigropallidal dopamine input, and as D1 dopamine receptors are implicated in the presynaptic control of GABA release from the terminals of striatal efferents, this would consequently reduce the level of GABA release in the GPM. The latter possibility would suggest that striatopallidal neurones projecting to GPM are more resistant to the effects of dopaminergic denervation than those projecting to GPL.", 
    "14": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors were studied in cultured astrocytes derived from genetically epilepsy-prone and control rats. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to astrocyte homogenates from epilepsy-prone rats showed 38% fewer BZD receptors (Bmax) as compared to controls. No significant change in affinity (Kd) was observed. These findings suggest that the astrocyte peripheral-type BZD receptor may be involved in some forms of epilepsy.", 
    "15": "Switching from a low (0.5 Hz) to a higher (5 Hz) frequency repetitive stimulation of hindlimb muscle nerve afferents reduced GABA-mediated dorsal root potentials and dorsal root reflexes in the lumbosacral cord of spinal cats. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists flumazenil and Ro 15-3505 in a very low dose (0.03 mg/kg i.v.) reversed this effect suggesting a stimulation-coupled release of an endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand down-regulating GABAA-receptors in the spinal cord.", 
    "16": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and exogenous benzodiazepines are thought to play a role in the neural regulation of circadian rhythms. Because binding sites for the benzodiazepines and GABAA ligands are functionally coupled as part of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex (GABAA/BZR), we analyzed the localization of GABA neurons and GABAA/BZR within 3 nuclei involved in circadian rhythm regulation using autoradiographic and immunohistochemical techniques. Glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive axons are present in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), and dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Immunoreactivity for the GABAA/BZ receptor complex is absent from the SCN and the IGL whereas the DR shows a dense, uniform immunoreactivity. Semiquantitative analysis of autoradiograms for [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam binding reveals a moderate level of binding in the SCN, a low level of binding in the IGL, and the highest level of the DR. Based on both the pattern of benzodiazepine binding and of receptor immunoreactivity the DR would appear to be a likely target site for GABAA and benzodiazepine action. The SCN would also appear to be a possible target site. The results suggest the IGL is not a site for direct GABAA and benzodiazepine action, but do not exclude a role for the IGL in the neural circuitry mediating GABA and benzodiazepine interactions with the circadian system.", 
    "17": "Morphine produced a hypothermic effect in restrained rats which was antagonized by naloxone. This effect was completely inhibited by gamma-acetylenic-GABA, an inhibitor of GABA transaminase and by baclofen, a specific GABAB agonist. Pretreatment with diazepam, an agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, partially inhibited morphine-induced hypothermia. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor blocker, potentiated the action of morphine on body temperature. A role of brain GABA in the thermoregulatory effects of morphine is proposed on the basis of these results.", 
    "18": "Diazepam, when administered in very low doses (100 micrograms/kg), can induce a specific inhibition of coarse and ambulation activities in the rat, suggesting a novel mechanism of action occurring in the microgram dose range. This study fails to reproduce the same effects with chlordiazepoxide. On the contrary, greater stimulant and anxiolytic effects were measured with the lowest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg). These results demonstrate that the familiar effects of benzodiazepines should not be extrapolated uncritically to lower dose ranges without empirical testing.", 
    "19": "The hypnotics, quazepam (a benzodiazepine), brotizolam (a thienotriazolodiazepine), zopiclone (a cyclopyrrolone) and zolpidem (an imidazopyridine) have a common ability to bind to the benzodiazepine recognition site (omega receptor) within the GABAA receptor. For this reason we compared their pharmacological profiles in mice. All compounds shared anticonvulsant and central depressant effects. However, the sedative activity of zolpidem appeared at much lower doses than did the anticonvulsant and myorelaxant effects but the opposite was observed with the other hypnotics. In contrast to brotizolam, quazepam and zopiclone, zolpidem did not increase food intake in mice placed in a novel environment, indicating that this drug lacks disinhibitory activity. Moreover the efficacy of zolpidem at the GABAA receptor, as indicated by its activity against convulsions induced by the GABA synthesis inhibitor, isoniazid, was much greater than that of other hypnotics. These results suggest that the hypnoselective properties observed with zolpidem might be related to a high selectivity for the omega 1 recognition site of the GABAA receptor coupled with a very high intrinsic activity.", 
    "20": "Employing [3H]Ro5-4864 as a radioligand, the existence of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in rat hind limb skeletal fibroblasts was explored. Saturable, high affinity binding of this ligand is described for fibroblasts and cell membrane preparations, demonstrating a pharmacological profile characteristic for such receptors. The binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 exhibited higher affinity and density in fibroblasts compared to membrane preparations. A quaternaryamine derivative of PK 11195 showed a similar potency as a displacer of [3H]Ro5-4864 in both preparations. The data suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are present in the plasma membrane of primary mammalian fibroblasts.", 
    "21": "Permanent phase shifts in the free-running rhythm of locomotor activity of the golden hamster were induced with microinjections of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists muscimol or baclofen in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei. Muscimol and baclofen exhibit relatively high binding affinities for GABAA and GABAB receptors, respectively. Microinjections of the GABA antagonists, bicuculline methobromide or picrotoxinin, thought to block the actions of GABA at GABAA receptors, could block phase shifts induced by muscimol but not the benzodiazepine, triazolam. Microinjections of the postsynaptic GABAB receptor antagonist phaclofen, which blocks the actions of GABA at postsynaptic but not at presynaptic GABAB receptor sites, did not block the phase-shifting actions of either muscimol or baclofen. GABAergic antagonists when given alone did not induce phase shifts. Collectively, these studies indicate that when activated by exogenous GABAergic agents, a GABAergic system associated with both GABAA and GABAB receptors exists as a neural regulatory mechanism that can reset the mammalian circadian clock. However, GABAergic synaptic pathways may not be normally involved in the circadian timing system.", 
    "22": "The effects of chronic treatment of mice with clonazepam have been examined on the responses of neocortical slices to adenosine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Responses to these agonists were measured as changes in the depolarisation induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Added to the superfusion medium diazepam blocked responses to adenosine but not 5-HT; this effect was not observed with 2-chloroadenosine or in the presence of 2-hydroxynitrobenzylthioguanosine. GABA was inactive in control slices but chronic treatment with clonazepam induced responses to GABA and enhanced responses to adenosine but not 5-HT. It is suggested that the induction of GABA responses may reflect the up-regulation of GABA receptors, but the increase of adenosine responses by clonazepam implies that there is no simple relationship between adenosine receptor binding and functional responses.", 
    "23": "The sorption of clonazepam to polyvinyl chloride tubing, polyethylene-coated tubing and to a polyethylene syringe was determined. Pumping of clonazepam (5 mg/48 ml) through the polyvinyl chloride tubing with flow rates of 2 ml/h and 4 ml/h resulted in a reduction of the clonazepam concentration to about 40% and 55% of the original strength after 0.6 h, respectively. This value was 55% at a flow rate of 2 ml/h and a clonazepam concentration of 10 mg/48 ml. The effluent clonazepam concentration increased gradually after an infusion period of 1 h. Sorption of clonazepam to the polyethylene syringe and to the tubing coated on the inside with polyethylene does not occur. The use of polyethylene-coated administration sets is recommended for intravenous administration of clonazepam.", 
    "24": "The passage of 6 model drugs; acetylsalicylic acid, chloramphenicol, ethimizol, carbisocaine, heptacaine, and diazepam, through the blood-brain barrier, was determined in unirradiated control rats and in animals 1, 3, and 7 days after irradiation of the head only with a dose of 25 Gy from a 60Co source. The brain uptake index (BUI), which compares the uptake of the test substance with that of 3H2O 5 s after their injection into the common carotid artery, was significantly increased in comparison with unirradiated controls 7 days after irradiation, for all substances tested except for ethimizol. For acetylsalicylic acid and chloramphenicol it was also significantly increased in the other time intervals. The less lipophilic substances showed a greater relative increase of BUI than the more lipophilic ones.", 
    "25": "The aim of adequate preoperative medication is to minimize the patient's anxiety level. Preoperative anxiety can be consciously and specifically orientated or it can be masked. This double-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of an anxiolytic drug in comparison with a placebo perioperatively and to assess the post-operative course of the important factors anxiety, depression and asthenia. The Mannheim inventory for subjective state and STAI (State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory) were offered. The study was undertaken in 60 female patients, who were operated for suspected carcinoma of the breast. We conclude that in such a specific group of patients extensive preoperative psychological preparation must be backed up by the administration of an anxiolytic drug.", 
    "26": "An overview of methods for the determination of benzodiazepines in biological media, based on the application of chromatographic techniques, is presented. A general discussion of the techniques in terms of stability, selectivity, validation, standardization, detection and sensitivity is given. No single technique can be claimed as the method of choice for benzodiazepines. Gas chromatography with electron-capture detection has some strong claims and shows generally good sensitivity and reproducibility. High-performance liquid chromatographic equipment is readily available in most laboratories. The ultimate choice of an assay method for benzodiazepines will be determined by the clinical application (routine monitoring, pharmacokinetics, overdose, forensic medicine) and by the characteristics of the benzodiazepine, the expertise of the analyst, the equipment available, the desired sensitivity and specificity and the time involved in method development or adaptation and validation.", 
    "27": "DL-beta-N-methylamino-alanine (DL-BMAA; 1-10 mumol i.c.v.) in mice induced a syndrome of: ataxia, ptosis, scratching, jumping, myoclonic jerks, clonic muscle spasms and tonic seizure, which was unaffected by pretreatment with D(-)-4-(3-phosphonoprop-2-enyl)-piperazine-2-carboxylate (D(-)-CPPene; i.p.), or by co-administration of gamma-D-glutamylamino-methylsulphonate (gamma-D-GAMS with DL-BMAA; i.c.v.). Pretreatment with 1-(aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466; i.v.) decreased the incidence of clonic seizures for DL-BMAA, kainic acid and RS-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (RS-AMPA; i.c.v.). These results suggest an involvement of the AMPA/quisqualate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptors in acute BMAA toxicity.", 
    "28": "The extensive use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia has led clinicians to wonder about the dependence potential of these drugs. It is estimated that, in Canada, the United States, and western Europe, between 10% and 20% of the population take tranquilizers or hypnotics (mainly benzodiazepines). Of these, 70% are 50 years of age or older; 15% have been taking these drugs for more than 12 months. One researcher reported that 50% of patients who received a prescription for benzodiazepines renewed it without consulting their physician. In this article, the authors briefly review the concept of dependence, the risk factors, and the clinical signs of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. They then develop a rational therapeutic approach to make it easier to discontinue these drugs.", 
    "29": "Abstract High concentrations of 'peripheral' benzodiazepine binding sites have been described in the pituitary gland and in several other endocrine glands, such as the adrenal glands and the testes. The role played by these receptors on the regulation of the endocrine system is largely unknown. In this study, we report the effects of two ligands of the 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptor, Ro5-4864 and PK 11195, on prolactin (PRL) release in the adult male rat. Ro5-4864 stimulated PRL release with half maximal and maximal stimulatory doses of about 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg, respectively. Pretreatment with the 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptor antagonist PK 11195 did not have any effect on Ro5-4864-induced PRL release. Accordingly, PK 11195, given alone, stimulated PRL release in a dose-dependent fashion. To examine whether the stimulatory effect of Ro5-4864 and PK 11195 on PRL release was due to a direct effect of these compounds at the pituitary gland, we used primary cultures of anterior pituicytes. Neither Ro5-4864 nor PK 11195 had an effect on basal PRL release nor were these agents capable of modulating thyrotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated or dopamine-inhibited PRL release. These findings suggest that administration of agents that interact with the 'peripheral' benzodiazepine binding receptor cause PRL release without directly stimulating the pituitary gland. We speculate that Ro5-4864 and PK 11195 increase plasma PRL levels by modulating brain release of neurotransmitters and/or neuropeptides involved in the regulation of PRL release.", 
    "30": "1. Effects of single doses of captopril (12.5, 25 and 50 mg) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and on body sway were studied in fourteen healthy male subjects. Oxazepam (15 mg), as an active control, and two placebos were included in the study, together with a single dose of atenolol (100 mg). Medication was administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and assessments made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug ingestion. 2. There were no changes in the EEG with captopril. Oxazepam reduced the circadian rise in alpha activity, while atenolol decreased beta power. Delta activity was modified by both oxazepam and atenolol. 3. A reduction in lower frequencies of body sway (0.05-1 Hz) occurred with captopril, while the spectra were unaffected by oxazepam. Atenolol increased (P less than 0.05) activity in the frequency range 0.75-2.75 Hz. 4. These observations suggest that captopril is free of central effects such as sedation that may occur with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Reduced body sway with captopril could reflect improved integration of central and peripheral control of posture.",

The drugs were administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and performance and subjective feelings were assessed before and from 1.5-2.5 h and 3.5-4.5 h after ingestion. 2. Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, together with critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. 3. Captopril did not impair performance on any of the tests, but improved short-term memory (P less than 0.05) and increased the number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05). Oxazepam reduced the number of substitutions completed in the digit symbol test (P less than 0.01), accuracy on continuous attention (P less than 0.05), number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05), and rate of finger tapping (P less than 0.05), and increased choice reaction time (P less than 0.001). Atenolol reduced the rate of finger tapping (P less than 0.05), but increased the number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05). 4. No effects on mood or on subjective feelings were evident with captopril. Oxazepam reduced subjective alertness (P less than 0.05), and atenolol increased feelings of sleepiness (P less than 0.05). 5. Although these observations suggest that central effects may exist with captopril, no adverse consequences have been established on performance or on subjective assessment of mood. Captopril may, therefore, be an appropriate drug for hypertensive patients engaged in skilled activity.", 
    "32": "To examine the effect of omeprazole on the hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme system microsomes from rat and human liver samples were incubated with midazolam (CAS 59467-70-8) in the absence and presence of various concentrations of omeprazole (CAS 73590-58-6), its sulfone metabolite and for comparison also with cimetidine. In the extracted incubation mixtures unchanged midazolam, a-OH-midazolam, 4-OH-midazolam and di-OH-midazolam were analyzed by HPLC. In both species omeprazole (and its sulfone) inhibited the formation of all three oxidized metabolites of midazolam and the corresponding IC50-values (range 0.2-1.3 mmol/l for rat microsomes and 0.2-1.5 mmol/l for human microsomes) were comparable to cimetidine (range 0.05 to 3.8 mmol/l). These results indicate that the oxidative metabolism of midazolam can be inhibited in vitro by omeprazole (and/or its sulfone metabolite) and this interaction should be considered if both drugs are administered concomitantly in man.", 
    "33": "The binding site characteristics and ontogenesis of [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) (M1 receptor) and [3H]oxotremorine-M ([3H]OXO-M) (M2 receptor) binding sites were investigated in the cat visual cortex. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PZ binding in adult cat visual cortex revealed a single site with a Kd of 17.3 nm and a Bmax of 352.45 fmol/mg protein. [3H]OXO-M also bound to a single site with a Kd of 7.1 nM and a Bmax of 256.39 fmol/mg protein. Receptor autoradiography revealed that [3H]PZ binding sites were present only in telencephalic structures while [3H]OXO-M sites were distributed heterogeneously throughout the brain. [3H]PZ binding sites in adult visual cortex were present in the superficial and deep cortical layers with the densest labeling in layer I and a distinct band in layer V. [3H]OXO-M sites also avoided the middle cortical layers, but were most prominent in layers V and VI with less pronounced binding in layers I and II. Deafferentation of extrinsic inputs to the visual cortex did not reduce [3H]PZ nor [3H]OZO-M binding, but neuron-specific excitotoxic lesions of visual cortex abolished both populations of binding sites. This indicates that both populations of binding sites are located on cells intrinsic to the cortex. In early postnatal life, both [3H]PZ and [3H]OXO-M binding sites were localized to intermediate cortical layers. Following this, the laminar distribution of both populations redistributed; each with its own idiosyncratic profile. By postnatal day 49, [3H]PZ binding sites redistributed into the superficial and deep layers, the pattern of adult animals, while [3H]OXO-M sites maintained a pattern similar to younger animals, with substantial binding persisting in layer IV. As late as postnatal day 70, well after [3H]PZ binding sites had achieved their mature laminar pattern, [3H]OXO-M binding sites in visual cortex had not achieved their characteristic adult pattern. In addition, the normal laminar redistribution of both [3H]PZ and [3H]OXO-M binding sites during postnatal development of the cat visual cortex was prevented by eliminating cortical afferents in early postnatal life. This indicates that muscarinic receptor rearrangement in development is dependent upon cortical input or output.", 
    "34": "Below is report on our experience using a relatively new benzodiazepine as treatment for refractory epilepsy in 30 children. All of the patients had a severely fixed encephalopathy; 17 presented mixed epilepsy, 9 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 4 others, West Syndrome. The seizures were totally controlled in 20% of the children; in a proportion superior to 75%, seizures were decreased in 46% of the patients. There were positive results in 6% of the cases and side-effects were seen in 13%. The usefulness of the clobazam as a co-adjuvant medication in the control of refractory epileptic seizures was demonstrated since the number of seizures decreased from 15 to 3 per day.", 
    "35": "Symptoms resembling mania following withdrawal of diazepam in a mentally handicapped woman are described. The importance of considering benzodiazepine withdrawal in the assessment of acute behavioural disorders of the mentally handicapped is emphasized. Attention is also drawn to the paucity of research regarding the use of antianxiety drugs in the mentally handicapped.", 
    "36": "The disposition of tracer doses of 3H-oxazepam was studied in the recirculating perfused mouse liver preparation. 3H-Oxazepam was biotransformed primarily to the diastereomeric 3H-oxazepam glucuronides, which either effluxed into the circulation or underwent biliary excretion. Three additional, unknown metabolites constituted a small fraction (5-10%) of the total radioactivity recovered in bile (7% of dose); no other metabolite was detected in perfusate. A physiologically based model, comprising the reservoir, liver blood and tissue, and bile, was fitted to reservoir concentrations of 3H-oxazepam and 3H-oxazepam glucuronides, and the cumulative amount excreted into bile. The model allowed for consideration of elimination pathways other than glucuronidation and the presence of a transport barrier for the oxazepam glucuronides across the hepatocyte membrane. The fitted results suggest a slight barrier existing for the transport of metabolites across the sinusoidal membrane, inasmuch as the transmembrane clearance was comparable to liver blood flow rate. Upon further comparison of estimates of formation, biliary, and transmembrane clearances for the oxazepam glucuronides, the rate-limiting step in the overall (biliary) clearance appears to be a poor capacity for biliary excretion. The influence of the cumulative volume loss that a recirculating perfused organ system incurs upon repeated sampling was discussed, and a compartmental method of correcting the observed concentrations of drug and generated metabolite was presented.", 
    "37": "Pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD) caused a more than twofold increase in pancreatic weight after 10 days, with no further increase after 15 or 20 days or 7 weeks. Although the weight gain after PBD to a minor extent (10%) reflected increased water content, the main cause was hypertrophy and hyperplasia with increased pancreatic protein and DNA content. The cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations in plasma were increased 10-fold from the 5th postoperative day. The trophic effects on the pancreas were completely abolished by the CCK antagonist L-364,718. Further, the antagonist caused a significant reduction in pancreatic weight, protein, and DNA in otherwise untreated controls. We conclude that PBD in rats induces trophic effects on the pancreas by increasing circulating CCK concentrations and that CCK is important for normal pancreatic growth.", 
    "38": "An HPLC assay is described that can be used to study the covalent bonding interaction of carbinolamine-containing pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines with the model nucleophile thiophenol, in order to evaluate electrophilicity at the C-11-position. Preliminary experiments with anthramycin, tomaymycin and neothramycin show that their reaction with thiophenol follows second-order kinetics, but the ranking order of reactivity (neothramycin greater than tomaymycin greater than anthramycin), does not correlate with either in vitro cytotoxicity or in vivo antitumour activity. This suggests that other factors such as non-covalent DNA-interaction or drug transport play a more crucial role in biological activity than simple alkylating ability. This assay should, however, prove a useful tool in the study of structure-activity relationships for this series of compounds and provide \"C-11-electrophilicity\" parameters for use in Hansch analysis and related studies.", 
    "39": "Eleven neonates with seizures had continuous EEGs recorded before and up to several hours after administration of anticonvulsant therapy. Six of seven babies given phenobarbitone responded clinically, but in four of these the EEG showed that seizure discharges either persisted or recurred within two hours. Chloral hydrate had no immediate effect in one case and only a doubtful influence on EEG seizure activity in another. Three babies were given benzodiazepines: after an apparently rapidly effective bolus dose of diazepam, recurrence of seizure discharges was almost immediate. Infusions of diazepam or clonazepam eventually were associated with persistent control of clinical and EEG seizures. In the treatment of neonatal seizures, conventional anticonvulsants are rarely completely effective: EEG monitoring is essential for optimal therapeutic intervention.", 
    "40": "Total intravenous anesthesia was performed with continuous infusion of midazolam and bolus injection of fentanyl. A bolus injection of midazolam 0.3 mg.kg-1 was followed by an infusion regimen with an initial infusion rate of 0.68 mg.kg-1.hr-1 for 15 min followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.125 mg.kg-1.hr-1 and infusion was stopped at about 30 min before the end of operation. Fentanyl and pancuronium were injected as required. Nicardipine was given for intraoperative hypertension. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine decreased significantly at 10 min after induction, but increased significantly during operation. Therefore, this anesthetic method was considered not to be so deep. Plasma concentrations of midazolam were higher than 200 ng.ml-1 during operation. After discontinuation of midazolam infusion, its concentration decreased quickly, and the elimination half life of midazolam was 1.675 +/- 0.2807 hr. The value was not so large as we had anticipated. Total intravenous anesthesia with continuous infusion of midazolam and bolus injection of fentanyl is thought to produce light anesthesia. Plasma concentration of midazolam decreased quickly.", 
    "41": "Eight patients (ASA I-II) scheduled for a minor surgery under lumbar epidural or spinal anesthesia were studied. The patients were sedated with approximately 0.2 mg.kg-1 of bolus injection followed by 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1 of continuous infusion of diazepam. In order to evaluate the reversing effects of 0.2 mg of flumazenil on the respiratory effects of diazepam, the following parameters were examined at three points, namely 1) control period, 2) during infusion of diazepam, and 3) ten minutes following injection of flumazenil; tidal volume, respiratory frequency, minute volume, inspiratory time/total time of breath (Tl/Tt) and %RC with a respiratory inductive plethysmograph, ventilatory response to carbon dioxide using a modified Read's rebreathing method. We found that with flumazenil, tidal volume and the slope of the ventilatory response curve to carbon dioxide increased and arterial carbon dioxide tension decreased. However, minute volume, respiratory frequency, Tl/Tt and %RC were unchanged with flumazenil. Flumazenil did not change other clinical features and did not produce any abnormal data in laboratory examination. We conclude that flumazenil reverses the respiratory effects of diazepam at least for ten minutes following its injection without producing any complications and side effects.", 
    "42": "The reduction of capillary hemorrhage obtained with ketamine induced us to use this agent in anaesthesia for eardrum plastic surgery. During a period of 8 years 278 operations of this type were performed with this method. Its results were very satisfactory especially with regard to postoperative analgesia. No increase of capillary bleeding was observed after a temporary rise of arterial pressure following induction. Premedication consisted of atropine 0.5 mg intravenous and diazepam (later substituted by midazolam) according to age and weight. Induction was realized with fentanyl 0.1 mg intravenously followed by ketamine 3 mg.kg-1 intravenously. Anaesthesia was maintained by infusion of ketamine (500 mg in 500 ml of saline solution), nitrous oxide-oxygen (50% each) inhalation and pancuronium or vecuronium. Ketamine infusion was stopped approximately 45 min before operation was completed. Most patients regained consciousness in about 15 to 30 min after nitrous oxide was discontinued. Side effects such as bad dreams were noticed only in 29 patients (10.43%). Perturbed recovery from ketamine anaesthesia might be largely prevented by psychological preoperative preparation and adequate dosage of the benzodiazepine used for premedication.", 
    "43": "The direct effects of midazolam on isometric force of contraction (Fc) and on transmembrane action potential (AP) in electrically driven right ventricular papillary muscles were investigated. The results were compared with the effects of thiopental. Midazolam (0.01-200 mumol/l) had a concentration-dependent maximal negative inotropic effect of 94 +/- 4% compared with the pre-drug value on the papillary muscles of animals pretreated with reserpine (RES) [7.5 mg/kg b.wt. i.p., 16-18 h prior to the study]. The IC25 and IC50 values were 2.9 mumol/l (2.0-4.5; n = 9) and 12.4 mumol/l (6.5-30; n = 9) respectively. However, on the papillary muscles of untreated animals (nRES) midazolam developed a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect (maximal 20 +/- 7%). Midazolam at a clinically relevant concentration of 2.8 mumol/l (= 1 microgram/ml; equivalent with the maximum plasma level following a midazolam i.v. bolus injection of 0.15 mg/kg b. wt.) reduced Fc by 15 +/- 3% (p less than 0.05) compared with the pre-drug value on the RES papillary muscles (n = 6) and increased Fc by 3 +/- 0.3% (p less than 0.05) on nRES animals. The resting membrane potential (RMP), the AP amplitude (APA) and the AP duration at 20% (APD20) and 90% (APD90) repolarisation showed no significant differences with midazolam (2.8 mumol/l; n = 5). Thiopental (0.01-200 mumol/l) produced a concentration-dependent maximal negative inotropic effect of 86 +/- 2% compared with the pre-drug value on the papillary muscles of nRES animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The intention of this study was to develop an intramuscular injectable anesthesia for swine. Therefore the clinical signs of several sedative or anesthetic drugs and their combinations were tested. The combinations of the phencyclidines ketamine and tiletamine with different benzodiazepines were most effective. The phencyclidines induced a rapid immobilisation of sufficient length. The benzodiazepines produced muscle relaxation, prolonged the immobilisation and suppressed the side effects of the phencyclidines like excitation. The analgetic action of the combinations were insufficient. Trials to improve analgesia by supplementation with opiates were only in the combination ketamine/climazolam/levomethadone successful. In other combinations opiates caused postanesthetic excitations with hyperthermia. The trials to improve the analgetic effect by combining tiletamine/zolazepam with imidazolidine-derivatives were only partly successful. But the tiletamine/zolazepam/imidazolidines-combinations caused severe hypothermia and other side effects. Because of postanesthetic excitations, the combination of ketamine with xylazine can not be recommended as a good anesthesia for swine. The action of ketamine with azaperone or different phenothiazine-derivatives was insufficient.", 
    "45": "The influences of premedication, anaesthetic agents, and postoperative sedation and pain treatment regimens on the experiences of postoperative respirator treatment of surgical patients (n = 107) have been assessed. Of the patients, 55% recalled the respirator treatment. Administration of anticholinergic drugs and halogenated anaesthetic agents was found to impair the memory process and reduce the number of recallers, and sedation in the ICU with benzodiazepines was found to decrease the number of discomforts experienced by the recalling patients. Most of the patients who received treatment postoperatively for pain, mainly by epidural administration of local anaesthetic agents and/or morphine, recalled the respirator treatment period (85%), as compared to only 50% of the patients receiving intravenous opioids. The number and type of complaints experienced by patients receiving epidural pain treatment did not, however, differ from those reported by intravenously treated patients, and no significant adverse psychological reactions seemed to occur. It is concluded that the use of mainly regional techniques, when appropriate, for pain treatment of surgical patients needing postoperative ventilatory support seems advantageous. The primary aim of relieving pain from the wound area is achieved, allowing such light intravenous sedation and pain treatment that the possibility of communication and giving comforting reassurance is maintained. Such nursing care may be more efficient in helping the patient to cope with the stressful respirator treatment situation then heavy intravenous sedation and pain treatment regimens.", 
    "46": "Although benzodiazepines have been proven safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of sedation, some instances require the reversal of these events prior to the natural process of metabolism and elimination. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is an antagonist that can reduce or terminate benzodiazepine effects in a dose-dependent manner. The antagonist acts by the competitive inhibition of benzodiazepines at their central nervous system receptor sites. When administered intravenously in incremental doses, flumazenil allows for optimal patient response on an individual basis. Despite its short elimination half-life, small doses of flumazenil are usually effective in producing benzodiazepine reversal. Flumazenil's short duration of activity is due to its rapid hepatic metabolism and elimination. Intravenous antagonist doses of 0.2 mg followed by 0.1 mg/min to a total dose of 1 mg have produced significant results in reversing benzodiazepine sedation. As much as 5 mg of flumazenil have been necessary when treating benzodiazepine or mixed-agent intoxications. In such situations, response rarely exceeds a duration of one hour. If resedation occurs, additional doses or an infusion of the antagonist may provide the desired response. Flumazenil is well tolerated locally as well as systemically. Nausea and vomiting occurring after anesthesia is the most documented adverse effect in both placebo and treatment populations. However, there has been no significant difference in the occurrence of vomiting in placebo compared with flumazenil-treated subjects. Careful observation and slow reversal of central nervous system depression is crucial in the avoidance of benzodiazepine withdrawal in those patients dependent upon these agents. Flumazenil appears to provide a mechanism for the safe and effective reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "This study compares the induction and recovery characteristics, haemodynamic changes and side effects of propofol, thiopentone and midazolam when used as the anaesthetic agents for cardioversion. Recovery after midazolam was significantly longer (p less than 0.05) than with either thiopentone or propofol. There was no difference in the recovery times between thiopentone and propofol. There was a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure 2 minutes after induction with propofol and midazolam. Three patients each in the thiopentone and propofol groups needed assisted ventilation because of apneoea, and four patients each in the propofol and midazolam groups had low Spo2 values (less than 95%). Flumazenil was used to reverse the effects of midazolam in eight patients and five of these were still drowsy 4 hours after the procedure. This study indicates that thiopentone is the most satisfactory agent for anaesthesia for cardioversion.", 
    "48": "Development of radiopharmaceuticals for functional brain imaging has progressed rapidly in recent years. Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow in humans can be achieved by using [123I]-iodoamphetamine or [99mTc]-HMPAO. Several other lipid-soluble [99mTc]-technetium complexes are currently undergoing clinical trials. New 123I-labeled agents designed to measure central nervous system receptors, including D1 and D2 dopamine, serotonin, muscarinic, and benzodiazepine receptors, have been developed. In conjunction with single photon emission computed tomography, they may provide useful tools to evaluate brain function related to changes in receptor concentration.", 
    "49": "Effects of 4 commonly used sedatives on the wheal-and-flare response to histamine and flea antigen were evaluated in 8 flea-allergic Beagles. Skin testing was performed in 12 separate occasions, 3 to 4 days apart. Twelve intradermal injections were given during each skin test: 5 doubling dilutions of histamine phosphate, 6 doubling dilutions of flea antigen, and a phosphate-buffered saline solution (negative control). Of the 12 intradermal skin tests, 8 were control tests performed on nonsedated dogs. The remaining 4 tests were performed on dogs sedated with xylazine, ketamine and valium combination, acepromazine, or oxymorphone. Oxymorphone had the most profound effect on skin test results, significantly (P less than 0.05) decreasing skin responsiveness in 8 of 11 test sites (by objective evaluation) and in 5 of 11 test sites (by subjective evaluation). Xylazine sedation enhanced skin test results in 4 of 11 test sites (by objective evaluation) and in 1 of 11 test sites (by subjective evaluation). In non instance did xylazine significantly decrease skin responsiveness to histamine or flea antigen. Xylazine is the recommended sedative in dogs when sedation is necessary for intradermal skin testing.", 
    "50": "Neuroprotective agents may exert their effect by reducing cerebral oxygen demand (CMRO2), increasing cerebral oxygen delivery, or by altering ongoing pathological processes. Barbiturates provide neuroprotection by reducing the CMRO2 necessary for synaptic transmission while leaving the component necessary for cellular metabolism intact. Isoflurane may exert a neuroprotective effect by a similar mechanism but its efficacy is likely less than that of barbiturates due to adverse effects on cerebral blood flow. Lidocaine reduces CMRO2 by affecting both cellular metabolic processes and synaptic transmission and thus resembles hypothermia in its mechanism of action. Benzodiazepines reduce CMRO2 by reducing synaptic transmission and their use as neuroprotectants produces less haemodynamic compromise than barbiturates. The mechanism of protection by calcium entry blocking agents appears to be due to improved blood flow as opposed to altering abnormal Ca++ fluxes. In contrast, agents such as ketamine and MK-801 may prevent abnormal Ca++ fluxes through their competitive interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Phenytoin prevents K(+)-mediated ischaemic events from progressing. Agents worthy of further investigation include corticosteroids, free radical scavengers, prostaglandin inhibitors and iron chelators.", 
    "51": "Sedoanalgesia is a technique developed to provide safe and satisfactory operating conditions for a wide range of patients independent of age and overall level of fitness (although its use in children remains to be established). It is suitable for both endoscopic and open procedures, day-cases and in-patients. When used in day-case surgery it significantly improves overall efficiency. It is recognised that day-case surgery is an important and cost-effective element in surgical care. With increasing restraints being imposed upon hospital finances, patient beds and staffing levels, any strategies designed to improve efficiency in this sphere of surgical activity are to be welcomed. That 93% of patients prefer sedoanalgesia to conventional general anaesthesia attests to its high degree of acceptability. The technique of sedoanalgesia, its applications and potential impact for urology are detailed.", 
    "52": "The induction of hepatic cytochromes P-450 by phenobarbital (PB) was studied in rat hepatocytes cultured for up to 5 weeks on Vitrogen-coated plates in serum-free modified Chee's medium then exposed to PB (0.75 mM) for an additional 4 days. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that P-450 forms PB4 (IIB1) and PB5 (IIB2) were induced dramatically (greater than 50-fold increase), up to levels nearly as high as those achieved in PB-induced rat liver in vivo. The newly synthesized cytochrome P-450 was enzymically active, as shown by the major induction of the P-450 PB4-dependent steroid 16 beta-hydroxylase and pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities in the PB-induced hepatocyte microsomes (up to 90-fold increase). PB induction of these P-450s was markedly enhanced by the presence of dexamethasone (50 nM-1 microM), which alone was not an affective inducing agent, and was inhibited by greater than 90% by 10% fetal bovine serum. The PB response was also inhibited (greater than 85%) by growth hormone (250 ng/ml), indicating that this hormone probably acts directly on the hepatocyte when it antagonizes the induction of P-450 PB4 in intact rats. In untreated hepatocytes, P-450 RLM2 (IIA2), P-450 3 (IIA1) and NADPH P-450 reductase levels were substantially maintained in the cultures for 10-20 days. The latter two enzymes were also inducible by PB to an extent (3-4 fold elevation) that is comparable with that observed in the liver in vivo. Moreover, P-450c (IA1) and P-450 3 (IIA1) were highly inducible by 3-methylcholanthrene (5 microM; 48 h exposure) even after 3 weeks in culture. In contrast, the male-specific pituitary-regulated P-450 form 2c (IIC11) was rapidly lost upon culturing the hepatocytes, suggesting that supplementation of appropriate hormonal factors may be necessary for its expression. The present hepatocyte culture system exhibits a responsiveness to drug inducers that is qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with that observed in vivo, and should prove valuable for more detailed investigations of the molecular and mechanistic basis of the response to PB and its modulation by endogenous hormones.", 
    "53": "We compared the effect on withdrawal severity and acute outcome of a 25% per week taper of short half-life vs long half-life benzodiazepines in 63 benzodiazepine-dependent patients. Patients unable to tolerate taper were permitted to slow the taper rate. Ninety percent of patients experienced a withdrawal reaction, but it was rarely more than mild to moderate. Nonetheless, 32% of long half-life and 42% of short half-life benzodiazepine-treated patients were unable to achieve a drug-free state. The most difficulty was experienced in the last half of taper. Baseline personality, high Eysenck neuroticism, female sex, and mild-to-moderate alcohol use were found to be more significant predictors of withdrawal severity than the daily benzodiazepine dose or benzodiazepine half-life. These findings suggest that personality factors contribute significantly to the patient's difficulties with gradual benzodiazepine discontinuation of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines.", 
    "54": "We compared the effect of abrupt discontinuation of therapeutic doses of short half-life and long half-life benzodiazepines in 57 benzodiazepine-dependent patients (daily use, greater than 1 year). Despite the use of a mean daily dose of 14.1 mg of diazepam equivalents, there were notable residual symptoms of anxiety and depression present at intake (Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score, 17.0; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, 14.0). Benzodiazepine intake was stabilized for 3 weeks before double-blind assignment to placebo (n = 47), or continued benzodiazepine use (n = 10). Clinical assessments were performed daily, including benzodiazepine plasma levels. Depending on the outcome criteria used, anywhere from 58% to 100% of patients were judged to have experienced a withdrawal reaction, with a peak severity at 2 days for short half-life and 4 to 7 days for long half-life benzodiazepines. Relapse onto benzodiazepines occurred in 27% of patients who were receiving long half-life benzodiazepines and in 57% of patients who were receiving short half-life benzodiazepines. Baseline predictors of relapse were nonpanic diagnoses, a higher benzodiazepine dose, and a higher Eysenck neuroticism score. A short half-life and higher daily doses were associated with greater withdrawal severity, as were personality traits, such as dependency and neuroticism, less education and higher baseline levels of anxious and depressive symptoms. Patients who were able to remain free of benzodiazepines for at least 5 weeks obtained lower levels of anxiety than before benzodiazepine discontinuation. These results provide a detailed picture of the symptoms, time course, and multidimensional determinants of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "55": "Concerns regarding the long-term toxicity of daily cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy for the systemic vasculitides have led us to evaluate alternative approaches to treatment in an attempt to achieve comparable efficacy with less toxicity. This study sought to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and immunologic effects of glucocorticoids (GC) and intermittent high-dose intravenous CP (\"pulse\" CP) in the treatment of 14 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG).", 
    "56": "The diagnosis of active WG was supported by a typical clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis. GC treatment was initially provided on a daily basis and later tapered to an alternate-day schedule if vasculitis remained inactive. Pulse CP treatment was initially administered once a month for 6 months. If after 6 months remission had been attained and GC therapy had been discontinued, then pulse CP treatment was given at less frequent intervals thereafter. Treatment and evaluation were provided for participants as inpatients in a clinical research center (National Institutes of Health).", 
    "57": "Thirteen of 14 patients (93%) initially experienced unequivocal improvement with pulse CP therapy, and seven of 14 (50%) achieved remission within 4 months. However, treatment was associated with significant toxicity in two patients and later relapses in nine patients, so that a total of 79% either failed to achieve sustained remission or were unable to continue therapy. Three of 14 (21%) patients have achieved sustained remissions with the pulse CP protocol and one additional patient (who had a limited exacerbation of WG) continues to receive that therapy after 14 to 22 months (mean 17 months).", 
    "58": "The use of pulse CP and GC therapy in 14 patients with WG was associated with a high initial response rate. However, failure to respond initially to treatment, to sustain improvement, or to tolerate continued treatment was noted in 79% of patients within a period of 1 to 22 months. These observations indicate that this particular pulse CP protocol does not achieve a high degree of lasting efficacy.", 
    "59": "A series of imidazo[4,5-e][1-4]diazepine-5,8-diones were synthesized from hypoxanthines. Certain of these cyclic homologues of caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and enprofylline were inhibitors of binding of adenosine analogues to rat brain A1 and A2 adenosine receptors and were antagonists of A2 adenosine receptors stimulatory to adenylate cyclase in rat PC12 cell membranes. Activity at adenosine receptors was lower than the corresponding xanthines, perhaps because imidazodiazepinediones contain a boat-shaped seven-membered ring rather than the planar heteroaryl ring system of the xanthines. The imidazodiazepinediones had low affinity for brain benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "60": "Symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of anxiety disorder frequently complicate the course of affective illness. Patients with depression may have panic attacks, phobias, severe social anxiety, obsessions, compulsions, and generalized anxiety. If the affective disorder is the primary condition, its treatment should be sufficient in most instances to relieve the concomitant anxiety symptoms. Thus, judicious choice of antidepressant therapy for treatment of major and atypical depression will usually resolve associated panic attacks, generalized anxiety, phobias, and compulsions. It must be recalled, however, that antidepressant therapy usually takes between 4 and 6 weeks to have full clinical effect; in the interim, anxiety symptoms may be the most troubling and disabling aspect of the illness. Therefore, using antianxiety agents in treating depressed patients who also have anxiety symptoms is often recommended while waiting for the antidepressant to work. Benzodiazepines are extremely useful for short-term treatment of most anxiety symptoms in depressed patients. The dose should be kept to the lowest possible to relieve symptoms, and the medication should be tapered and then discontinued once the underlying affective disturbance is relieved. Buspirone is also very effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder and may be used in conjunction with antidepressants of most classes. A wide range of behavioral and cognitive techniques may also help relieve anxiety symptoms in the depressed patient.", 
    "61": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is the precursor of a family of peptides, including an octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), which share with DBI the ability to specifically displace benzodiazepines (BZD) from their receptors. BZD receptors have been found not only in the brain, but also in a variety of peripheral tissues, including the testis. To clarify the role of ODN in the testis, we have investigated the localization of ODN in the rat testis using two different cytochemical approaches: immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Immunocytochemical localization was achieved using rabbit antibodies developed against rat ODN. At the light microscopic level, immunostaining was exclusively located in interstitial cells; the seminiferous tubules were totally unlabeled. In the developing rat, immunostaining in the interstitial cells was first detected in an 18-day-old fetus. The immunolabeling increased as a function of age to reach a plateau at 40 days of age. The ultrastructural localization of ODN was achieved by immunogold staining. The gold particles were exclusively found in the cytoplasm of Leydig cells. HPLC analysis performed in adult rat testicular extracts revealed that immunoreactive material was detected in a peak eluted later than synthetic rat ODN. The cellular distribution of ODN was also studied by in situ hybridization using a 35S-labeled single stranded RNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA. Hybridization signal obtained at the light microscopic level was only detected over interstitial cells. The data obtained clearly indicate that in the rat, Leydig cells synthesize ODN and accumulate ODN-like immunoreactivity. Since Leydig cells have been shown to contain BZD receptors, it might be hypothesized that ODN and/or other DBI-related peptides can play a role in Leydig cell regulation.", 
    "62": "A specific [3H] GABA and [14C] flunitrazepam binding sites have been identified in a membrane fraction of human myometrium. The specific binding of [14C] GABA was displaced by unlabelled GABA and bicuculline. It was shown that the binding of [3H] flunitrazepam to membrane preparations is enhanced in the presence of GABA. A similar reciprocal effect of benzodiazepines to enhance [14C] GABA binding has been demonstrated. The present results indicate that GABAA-BD receptors complexes may have a functional significance in human ovary.", 
    "63": "The binding of 3H-RO 5-4864 to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBZDR) in rat testicular interstitial cells (TIC) was characterized. The binding was saturable, reversible and showed a single high-affinity (Kd = 5.02 +/- 0.86 nM) class of binding sites. The maximal binding capacity (Bmax) in crude mitochondrial fractions (77.6 +/- 9.1 pmol/mg protein) represents the highest density of PBZDR in tissues thus far studied. In comparison with the crude mitochondrial fraction the subcellular fractionation of TIC revealed a 2-fold enrichment of 3H-RO 5-4864 binding sites to the purified mitochondria (Bmax = 140 +/- 23 pmol/mg protein). The ability of various drugs to displace 3H-RO 5-4864 from TIC binding sites was examined and the inhibition constants (Ki) for RO 5-4864, PK 11195, diazepam and flunitrazepam were 3.5, 4.4, 159, and 353 nM, respectively, whereas clonazepam and RO 15-1788 were inefficient in displacing 3H-RO 5-4864 (Ki greater than 10 microM). This pharmacological profile is characteristic of PBZDR described in other tissues. In conclusion, rat TIC possess a very high concentration of PBZDR primarily associated with mitochondrial membranes.", 
    "64": "The binding of the 11C-labeled benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) was measured in the neocortex of live Papio papio baboons by positron emission tomography. This allowed us to calculate in vivo (i.e., at physiological temperature, neurotransmitters concentrations, and ionic environment) the apparent density of available benzodiazepine receptors (B'max) and the dissociation constant of Ro 15-1788 (Kd). By coadministering increasing doses of unlabeled Ro 15-1788 with [11C]Ro 15-1788 and assuming that nonsaturable radioactivity indicated the free ligand concentration, we were able to obtain saturation isotherms. We showed that a state of quasiequilibrium was reached 50 min after the administration of the radioligand. Linear Scatchard plots allowed us to calculate B'max at 78 and 50 pmol/ml of cerebral tissue in the occipital and frontal cortices, respectively. In both these areas, Kd is on the order of 6 nM, with a Hill number very close to unity. This indicates that Ro 15-1788 binds in vivo with high affinity to an homogeneous population of saturable sites. A similar measurement was carried out on a naturally photosensitive P. papio baboon. Absolute values of B'max, Kd, and Hill number were similar to those of the control baboons. Although results concerning this baboon can only be considered as a case report, this similarity may suggest that its epileptic syndrome is not related to a large change in B'max or Kd, at least in occipital and frontal cortices. Our results showed that quantitative estimation by positron emission tomography of some characteristics of benzodiazepine receptors is possible in live baboons and may represent a supplementary tool for investigating further the molecular mechanisms of benzodiazepine receptor function in physiological and physiopathological conditions. We suggest that a similar method of quantification of classic in vivo [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding could be usefully adapted when studying rodent models of epilepsy, stress, and other neuropsychological disorders. On the other hand, the similarity between the B'max and Kd values we obtained in baboons and those recently reported in humans using similar methods emphasizes that most of the in vivo characteristics of the benzodiazepine receptors of baboons are very close to those of human benzodiazepine receptors. This confirms that P. papio baboons are a suitable animal model for studying the pharmacology of benzodiazepine receptor ligands before clinical applications in humans.", 
    "65": "The binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) was studied in normal and malignant submandibular glands of rats. The carcinoma was induced by implantation of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) into the glands. [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to normal and malignant submandibular glands indicated one population of binding sites with high affinity (KD of 3.4 and 4.4 nM for normal and malignant respectively) and saturability (Bmax) of 487 and 321 pmol/g tissue for normal and malignant respectively). Subcellular localization of PBRs indicates that mitochondria was the primary locale of the receptor in both cases and the decrease in Bmax was due primarily to a decrease in the binding capacity of PBRs in mitochondria.", 
    "66": "The possibility that panic disorder might be due to abnormal activity of endogenous ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor was investigated with the use of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Physiological and subjective psychological responses to this selective antagonist were measured in 10 patients with panic disorder and in 10 control subjects, by using a placebo-controlled crossover study design. Subjective anxiety responses after flumazenil infusion were significantly higher in the patient group with panic disorder than in the controls, and eight patients with panic disorder but no controls had panic attacks. This anxiogenic effect of flumazenil in the patients argues against the presence of endogenous anxiogenic (inverse agonist) ligands. Possible explanations include the differential production of an anxiolytic endogenous ligand or an altered benzodiazepine receptor \"set-point.\" Such an abnormality may contribute to the pathogenesis of panic disorder.", 
    "67": "A series of 5-aryl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ones was evaluated for anticonvulsant activity. In general the members of this series were prepared by the alkaline cyclization of 1-aroyl-4-alkylsemicarbazides. The resulting 2-unsubstituted 3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ones were then alkylated, yielding 2,4-dialkyl-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ones. Approximately one-third of the compounds examined exhibited activity against both maximal electroshock- and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in mice. Receptor-binding studies suggest that this activity was not a consequence of activity at either benzodiazepine or NMDA-type glutamate receptors. From this series, compound 45 was selected for further evaluation where it was also found to be active against 3-mercaptopropionic acid, bicuculline, and quinolinic acid induced seizures in mice. In addition, 45 also protected gerbils from hippocampal neuronal degeneration produced by either hypoxia or intrastriatal quinolinic acid injection.", 
    "68": "Acute cocaine administration has been reported to alter central benzodiazepine binding in animals. The authors examined the effects of chronic cocaine use on binding at the peripheral benzodiazepine site on platelets in cocaine users (N = 8), heavy ethanol users (N = 4), and controls (N = 7). The groups were matched for age and sex. None of the subjects reported recent benzodiazepine use, but neither serum nor urine testing was performed. Apparent affinity at the peripheral benzodiazepine site was similar in the three groups. However, the number of binding sites was significantly greater in cocaine users. These results indicate that cocaine use affects peripheral benzodiazepine binding in humans and might also alter central benzodiazepine effects.", 
    "69": "The GABAA receptor gamma 1 subunit of human, rat and bovine origin was molecularly cloned and compared with the gamma 2 subunit in structure and function. Both gamma subunit variants share 74% sequence similarity and are prominently synthesized in often distinct areas of the central nervous system as documented by in situ hybridization. When co-expressed with alpha and beta subunits in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells, the gamma variants mediate the potentiation of GABA evoked currents by benzodiazepines and help generate high-affinity binding sites for these drugs. However, these sites show disparate pharmacological properties which, for receptors assembled from alpha 1, beta 1 and gamma 1 subunits, are characterized by the conspicuous loss in affinity for neutral antagonists (e.g. flumazenil) and negative modulators (e.g. DMCM). These findings reveal a pronounced effect of gamma subunit variants on GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor pharmacology.", 
    "70": "The temperature dependence of in vitro binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 to benzodiazepine receptors in human postmortem neocortex and neocerebellum homogenates was studied. An increase of the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) from 1.40 nmol/L and 1.04 nmol/L at 4 degrees C to 6.10 nmol/L and 8.91 nmol/L at 37 degrees C was found for neocortex and neocerebellum, respectively. In contrast, maximal binding (Bmax) remained in the range of 30-35 fmol/mg for neocortex and 24-27 fmol/mg of tissue (wet weight) for neocerebellum at all the temperatures. The KD of 6.10 nmol/L for neocortex at 37 degrees C in vitro is of the same order as the KD of 10 nmol/L obtained by positron emission tomography for [11C]Ro 15-1788 binding to benzodiazepine receptors in the human neocortex in vivo. The differences in KD between in vitro and in vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding to human neocortex and cerebellum seem to be due at least partially to temperature differences of in vitro and in vivo studies.", 
    "71": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian retina, where it serves many roles in establishing complex response characteristics of ganglion cells. We now provide biochemical and physiological evidence that at least three subclasses of GABA receptors (A1, A2, and B) contribute to different types of synaptic integration. Receptor binding studies indicate that approximately three-fourths of the total number of [3H]GABA binding sites in retina are displaced by the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, whereas one-fourth are displaced by the GABA-B receptor agonist, baclofen. GABAA receptors can be described by a three-site binding model with KD values of 19 nM, 122 nM, and 5.7 microM. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates potentiate binding to the GABAA site, which suggests that significant numbers of GABAA receptors are coupled to regulatory sites for these compounds and thus are classified as GABAA1 receptors. The response to pentobarbital appears to involve a conversion of low-affinity sites to higher-affinity sites, and is reflected in changes in the densities of sites at different affinities. Functional studies were used to establish which of the different receptor subclasses regulate release from cholinergic amacrine cells. Our results show that GABA suppresses light-evoked [3H]acetylcholine release via GABAA2 receptors not coupled to a benzodiazepine or barbiturate regulatory site, and enhances release via GABAB receptors. GABAA1 sites do not appear to control acetylcholine release in rabbit retina.", 
    "72": "The primary goal of this study was to determine whether the amphetamine challenge test (ACT) response, as measured by a subjective rating scale, the How I Feel Scale (HIF), could predict antidepressant treatment outcome. Following a 1-day non-blind ACT with dextroamphetamine (d-AMPH), patients were treated double-blind for 6 weeks with either desipramine, alprazolam, or a desipramine-alprazolam combination. Regression (true score) analyses were carried out on pre- and post-ACT HIF scores and on baseline and end of study Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores to determine the magnitudes of improvement measured in response to the ACT and antidepressant treatment, respectively. Regression analyses were performed on the residuals (true scores of improvement) to determine the best fitting (linear) prediction equation. Improvement in the HIF total score predicted HDRS improvement for the whole sample. Possible sources of error contributing to the outcome are identified and the results are discussed in relation to previous clinical investigations of the potential usefulness of the ACT as a predictor of antidepressant response.", 
    "73": "Right heart failure in patients with carcinoid heart disease is a serious prognostic sign. Consideration and adequate timing of valvular operations seem essential for the postoperative outcome. Without any relation to duration or progression of the metastasizing tumor disease, right heart failure developed and increased rapidly for a period of 12 to 17 months in four patients with classic carcinoid syndrome. Invasive hemodynamic and cardiac ultrasound investigations revealed severe carcinoid heart disease, and medical decompensation treatment gradually failed. Tricuspid and pulmonic valve replacement operations resulted in dramatic improvement in three of the patients, and these patients were still free of cardiac symptoms 10, 12, and 38 months postoperatively. One patient died 5 days postoperatively probably of septicemia. The preoperative and postoperative development of the cardiac disease is evaluated clinically, by cardiac ultrasound and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, and related to the tumor disease. Surgical anatomy and operative technique are reported, and the beneficial value of prophylactic treatment of the effects of tumor-released vasoactive substances by a somatostatin analog is emphasized.", 
    "74": "The aim of this study is to determine the efficiency ot toxicologic screening (detection of barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates, phenothiazines, meprobamate and ethanol assay), during acute drug poisoning. In 1988, 898 patients are enclose in this study. Screenings are negative in 17% of cases; benzodiazepines, alcohol and antidepressants are often found. The recovery is very good for barbiturates and salicylates but it's not perfect for benzodiazepines, particularly flunitrazepam triazolam, loflazepate, oxazepam, and non tricyclic antidepressants. This failure probably depends on these emergency methods.", 
    "75": "Glucuronidation of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (7-OH-4-MC) was comparable in three of the four human liver samples studied. In liver sample IV the glucuronidation rate of 7-OH-4-MC was almost 40% of that in the other samples. That might be due to interindividual variation in the capacity to glucuronidate. Glucuronidation rates were not reduced in the one human liver sample which displayed mild centrilobular cholestasis on histopathology. Furosemide (FR), salicylic acid (SA), lorazepam (Z) and menthol (MT) inhibited the glucuronidation of 7-OH-4-MC to varying degrees (30-90%). Paracetamol (PA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) were not inhibitors of the glucuronidation of 7-OH-4-MC. These findings suggest the presence of other UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) isozymes in the human liver microsomes which are responsible for the glucuronidation of PA and HT than those which glucuronidate 7-OH-4-MC.", 
    "76": "A potential pharmacokinetic interaction between lithium and alprazolam was studied in 10 normal subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the following regimens: single-dose alprazolam, multiple-dose lithium, and multiple-dose alprazolam with lithium. Steady-state alprazolam clearance during multiple dosing with lithium was not different from that with the single dose of alprazolam. Lithium renal clearance decreased when it was coadministered with alprazolam (31.2 vs. 22.4 ml/minute, p less than 0.05). There was a small but significant increase in the steady-state area under the curve for lithium in the presence of alprazolam (10.3 vs. 11.1 mEq/hour/liter). The small increase in the serum lithium concentrations and decrease in lithium renal clearance was probably the result of lower urine flow rates (1.46 vs. 0.98 ml/minute, p less than 0.05) with the combination of the drugs. This is supported by a weak but significant linear relationship between urine flow rates and lithium renal clearance (N = 57, r = 0.353, p = 0.007). The percent of daily lithium dose recovered at steady-state from the 24-hour urine collection decreased significantly from 93.6% to 78.2% in the presence of alprazolam. This suggests that alprazolam may decrease lithium absorption. The results of this study do not support a definitive interaction of lithium and alprazolam and there is little clinical significance to the small rise in serum lithium concentrations.", 
    "77": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop after exposure to severe stress, such as combat, accidents, assaults, and natural disasters. Pharmacotherapy can be a useful adjunct in the comprehensive treatment of these patients. The presence of comorbid conditions, including depression, panic disorder, substance abuse, and traumatic brain injury, should be carefully evaluated. Symptoms of PTSD that are associated with central nervous system hyperarousal or reexperiencing of the traumatic event appear to be the most responsive to pharmacotherapy. Social withdrawal and dulled responsiveness have not been shown to be alleviated through standard pharmacologic interventions. A therapeutic strategy is proposed that is based on the patient's symptoms and initial response to medication.", 
    "78": "Flumazenil, a specific competitive benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated for reversal of residual sedation after midazolam-induced ambulatory general anesthesia. Endotracheal anesthesia was begun with midazolam (mean +/- SD dose 12.4 +/- 2.4 mg), followed by nitrous oxide in oxygen, fentanyl, and succinylcholine, for gynecologic surgery lasting 38.6 +/- 12.5 min. After surgery, 29 women were given repeated injections of small amounts of either flumazenil or placebo until awake and calm. The mean flumazenil dose was 0.83 +/- 0.04 mg. Assessment of recovery was based on psychodiagnostic tests (visual analog sedation scale, Trieger dot, digit symbol substitution), pulse oxygen saturation, and end-expired carbon dioxide tension. Patients given flumazenil scored significantly better than did those given placebo on the psychodiagnostic tests for 5-60 min, but the groups were no longer different 120 and 180 min after the conclusion of surgery. All scores did not return to preoperative values by 180 min. Pulse oxygen saturation and end-expired carbon dioxide tension showed improvement from postoperative levels at 15 min after flumazenil injection. A controllable degree of midazolam reversal was achieved with flumazenil, but the duration of reversal was limited. Caution is needed to avoid premature discharge of ambulatory patients after midazolam-induced general anesthesia during the time that flumazenil is effective.", 
    "79": "This article presents the results of a patient questionnaire on response to minor oral surgery carried out under local anaesthetic and intravenous sedation. The predominantly favourable response of the respondents leads the author to suggest the use of IV sedation as a means of reducing patient anxiety, and so increasing dental attendance.", 
    "80": "Nuvenzepine, a new pirenzepine-analog, administered intraduodenally, displayed a long-lasting and dose-dependent inhibition of neostigmine-induced intestinal motility in anaesthetized cats. On ileal motor activity, the compound showed a potency 10 times greater than that of pirenzepine, and, although to a lesser extent, it was also active, unlike pirenzepine, on colonic stimulated motility. Furthermore, in conscious cats, nuvenzepine inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion resulting 25-30 times more potent than pirenzepine. The observed differences between antisecretory and antispastic activities displayed by nuvenzepine and pirenzepine suggest that the new pirenzepine-analog may act on gastrointestinal functions through an additional non-anticholinergic mechanism.", 
    "81": "The aim of this study was to develop a simple method for investigating drug influences on the cytochrome P-450 system of rats in vivo. The effects of diazepam on muscle coordination were quantified by the time the rats needed to descend a distance of 1 m on a rubberized bar hanging at an angle of 45 degrees. The effects of some previously identified inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 system, e.g., SKF 525 A, metyrapone, ketoconazole, 2-phenylimidazole, nitrendipine, omeprazole and cimetidine, were tested and the 50% prolongation of diazepam effect was calculated. In order to stimulate the drug-metabolizing enzymes, pentobarbital was administered twice daily on three consecutive days. The running bar test constitutes a simple method to test for inhibition and induction of the cytochrome P-450 system by drugs. Because diazepam is often used as co-medication, the findings seem to be of greater clinical relevance than those obtained with other substrates. The newly developed test system can be used in addition to in vitro methods before clinical use of a drug and also as second screening test in the development of new drugs.", 
    "82": "Fifty-three breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy entered a double-blind randomized trial of lorazepam 2.5 mg orally prior to chemotherapy and repeated after 12 hours (Arm A) versus placebo (Arm B) with methylprednisolone (MPN) 375 mg in 3 equal doses: 125 mg i.v. prior to chemotherapy and repeated i.m. 6 and 12 hours later. Adjuvant therapy with 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, 4'-epi-doxorubicin 60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (FEC) day 1 was alternated every 21 days with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 (CMF) day 1 for a total of 12 courses. The majority of patients experienced greater than or equal to 5 emetic episodes with FEC therapy (Arm A = 52%; Arm B = 55%). Mild and moderate nausea were reported by 60% and 68% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively. With CMF therapy complete control of emesis was observed in 33% (Arm A) and 35% (Arm B) of patients. The addition of lorazepam did not improve results either with FEC or CMF. Sedation was experienced by 86 to 92% of patients treated with lorazepam and amnesia was observed in 48-50% of cases. FEC therapy must be considered a highly emetic regimen and antiemetic therapy planned accordingly.", 
    "83": "Piroxicam binding to HSA was studied using equilibrium dialysis and fluorescence methods. It was shown that this drug, like its analogs isoxicam and tenoxicam, binds to the apazone locus (site I area) and to a lesser extent to the diazepam site (site II). The piroxicam binding to HSA can be modulated by various specific ligands--apazone, warfarin, diazepam, ibuprofen--and these drug interactions have to be considered not only as potential displacement from the HSA binding sites but also in terms of induced allosteric effects.", 
    "84": "The correlation between suicide rate and aspects of treatment have been little studied in suicidology in spite of medicalization of suicide. This study compares the medication of 30 patients who committed suicide during 1980-1989 from a catchment area in rural Ireland with 20 who attempted suicide in a neighbouring area where there were no suicides. More drugs had been given to patients who committed suicide and they received higher doses of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines than those who merely attempted suicide.", 
    "85": "Zopiclone (7.5 mg), a cyclopyrrolone derivative with a 6.5 h half-life, and flurazepam (30 mg) were compared to placebo in a randomized double-blind study involving 36 adult patients suffering from insomnia. All previous psychotropic drugs were discontinued 1 week prior to the study. During 4 weeks, 12 patients received zopiclone, 12 flurazepam and the others placebo. Thereafter, all patients received single-blind placebo for 3 nights. Rapidity of sleep onset, sleep duration, frequency of nocturnal awakenings, psychomotor coordination and side-effects were assessed daily with a questionnaire and a symptom checklist. The results of the study suggest that zopiclone 7.5 mg was at least as potent as flurazepam 30 mg in inducing and maintaining sleep. Both drugs maintained their efficacy during the 4 weeks of treatment. However, the two drugs differed in that flurazepam impaired psychomotor coordination whereas zopiclone did not demonstrate daytime protracted effects on psychomotor performance. Upon discontinuation of drug treatment, score values of the different sleep parameters under study returned to the baseline values. Side-effects were mild and consistent with earlier studies.", 
    "86": "More than 135 different strategies for medical treatment have been described for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndromes. The substances used most frequently (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or clomethiazol) themselves pose some risk for abuse or addiction. Anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine (CBZ), have been discussed for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal since the early seventies. Various studies report favourable results with CBZ, usually combined with sedative agents. Nineteen out-patients and 19 in-patients took part in an open study of CBZ in alcohol withdrawal. The dose of CBZ was adjusted individually and ranged from a mean dose of 761 mg on day 1 to 616 mg on day 3 and to 388 mg on day 7 in the group of out-patients, and from 789 mg on day 1, 694 mg on day 3 to 562 mg on day 7 in the sample of in-patients. The \"Objective Clinical Scale in Assessment and Measurement of Alcohol Withdrawal\" (OCSAMAW) was used for treatment evaluation. Statistical analysis showed a significant improvement on the 5%-level in both groups; four in-patients needed concomitant treatment with oxazepam. Nausea and pruritus were the most common side-effects of CBZ treatment.", 
    "87": "Dose-frequency curves of toxic effects of a substance A were evaluated in the absence and in the presence of a fixed dose of a second substance B. Data were fitted by the curve-fitting program ALLFIT. Observed combined frequencies of A + B were compared statistically with the expected frequencies of additivity and (or) independence by the phi 2-square goodness-of-fit test. The theoretical dose-frequency curves expected for an additive response were obtained by a solely graphical procedure and the theoretical curves for independent effects were calculated from the effects of B and A at certain doses. In rotarod tests with trained mice, the combined deteriorating effect of ethanol and benzodiazepines were significantly over-additive. However, their lethal interaction appeared underadditive in mice. The lethal underadditive interaction of ethanol and phencyclidine (PCP) can be ascribed largely to independent actions of these compounds. Loss of righting reflex was additively enhanced by PCP, whereas PCP overadditively enhanced the effect of ethanol. The insecticidal action of the cholinesterase inhibitors malathion and parathion appeared additive and significantly different from independent interaction. A comparison of results from dose-response curves with isoboles showed good agreement. The method appears as an attractive alternative or as a complementary procedure to the isobolographic analysis. Combination experiments as described can be carried out and evaluated rather simply, with a minimum of expenditure and a maximum of information."
