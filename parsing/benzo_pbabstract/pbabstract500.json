Frequency analyzed EEG recordings from both hemispheres at three activation levels (relaxation, vigilance, stress) were evaluated and left/right log power ratios formed to ascertain possible hemispheric preponderance, a total of 201600 ratios being evaluated. Blood levels, performance and self estimated mood modalities were obtained. Significant effects (1) of different types of treatment, (2) of a shift in type of treatment and (3) of shifts in activation level on frequency dependent hemispheric preponderance were ascertained and a relation to changes in clinical course of mood modalities was established.", 
    "1": "Peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites (PBzS) were characterized on placental explant membranes. [3H]PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, which is a ligand specific for PBzS, labeled these sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.1 nM; the maximal number of binding sites was 396 fmol/mg protein. The effect of various BZ ligands and PK 11195 on the secretion of progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17 beta (E2) from human term placental explants was studied. Exposure of placental explants to low doses (10(-8) M) of Ro 5-4864, a BZ ligand which binds with high affinity to PBzS, caused a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the secretion of P4 and E2 into the media (2.4- and 1.4-fold, respectively). On the other hand, high doses (10(-5) M) of Ro 5-4864 caused a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in the secretion of P4 and E2 into the media. Also, exposure of explants to diazepam (10(-7) M) and PK 11195 (10(-6) M) caused a significant increase in P4 and E2 secretion into the media. In contrast, clonazepam, a BZ ligand specific for the central-type receptors, had no effect on the secretion of either steroid. The combination of diazepam (10(-7) M) or Ro 5-4864 (10(-8) M) with PK 11195 (10(-6) M) did not enhance the stimulatory effects obtained with each agent alone. The effects exerted by Ro 5-4864, PK 11195, and diazepam may be mediated via PBzS.", 
    "2": "A sample of 1979 community residents aged 15 years and above was assessed in a major survey of health status and consumption of psychotropic medication. Interviews were conducted in the subjects' home by a psychiatrically trained physician, who actually inspected the subjects' medical supplies. Of all subjects 6.9% (4.3% of the males and 9.0% of the females) had used a drug containing a benzodiazepine at least once in the 4 weeks preceding the interview. In the same period 3.6% had taken a medication containing a barbiturate, 2.2% a medicine containing an opioid (mainly codeine), 1.8% had taken a neuroleptic drug, 1.5% an antidepressant, 0.8% a carbamine-acid derivative and 0.1% lithium. High use of psychotropic medication was associated with higher age, female sex, higher psychiatric morbidity, higher somatic morbidity, reduced work capacity and higher neuroticism but not with social class and not with the personality factor extra- or introversion.", 
    "3": "The metabolism of midazolam and triazolam to their 1'-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy metabolites was studied in microsomes of 15 human livers. The formation of both metabolites was inhibited by more than 90% by an antiserum directed against a pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile-inducible cytochrome P450 (P450PCN1) of rat liver. Moreover, midazolam hydroxylase activity was immunoprecipitated from solubilized human microsomes with polyclonal antibodies against rat P450PCN1 and the closely related human isozyme P450NF. A close correlation was observed between the amount of protein detected in immunoblots with these antibodies and the midazolam or triazolam hydrxylase activity. The formation of both metabolites of midazolam was inhibited by triacetyloleandomycin, a known inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the IIIA family. Direct evidence that P450IIIA4 catalyzes the metabolism of midazolam was provided through the use of cDNA-directed expression. Monkey COS cells transfected with human P450PCN1 cDNA were able to catalyze both the 1'- and the 4-hydroxylation of midazolam. We conclude that the metabolism of midazolam and triazolam in human liver is predominantly mediated by cytochrome P450IIIA4. Two of 15 human livers expressed a second immunoreactive microsomal protein of higher apparent Mr and were more active in midazolam 1'-hydroxylation. Our data also provide evidence that the marked interindividual variation in the response to these widely used benzodiazepine drugs is due to variable hepatic metabolism.", 
    "4": "Predominately neuronal cell cultures were produced as described in previous communications. Neuronal cells were exposed to ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) at varying concentrations. Studies of the neuronal cells were performed at 13 and 20 days in culture. In addition to morphologic studies, biochemical assays including choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, specific [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) binding, clonazepam (CLO)-displaceable [3H]FLU binding, Ro5-4864-displaceable [3H]FLU binding, high-affinity [3H]GABA uptake, and protein determinations were performed. The data demonstrate that chelated ferric iron has an adverse effect on predominately neuronal cultures after 7 days of exposure as measured by choline acetyltransferase activity, while other measures remained unaffected; however, after 14 days of exposure all measures were significantly decreased. The effects of Fe-NTA exposure appear to be both concentration and duration-of-exposure related.", 
    "5": "The protein binding of ethinyloestradiol (EE2) was investigated in the plasma from 14 healthy volunteers, 10 patients with hyperbilirubinemia, 10 patients with liver cirrhosis and 10 patients with renal failure. Binding assay was performed by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C. The unbound fraction (mean +/- SD) of EE2 was 1.17 +/- 0.12 (volunteers), 2.74 +/- 0.77 (hyperbilirubinemics; p less than 0.001) 1.51 +/- 0.31 (cirrhotics; p less than 0.01) and 1.44 +/- 0.11 (renal failure; p less than 0.001). Studies with isolated albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein showed that albumin is the major plasma protein to bind EE2. Warfarin (75 microM) and diazepam (75 microM) increased by 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively, the unbound fraction of EE2 when albumin concentration was 15 microM. Under similar conditions, digitoxin did not modify the binding of EE2. At therapeutic concentrations, warfarin and diazepam did not affect the binding of EE2 in plasma.", 
    "6": "In the present prospective study, perioperative anxiety was investigated in 52 patients, who underwent transvaginal follicular centesis for IVF treatment. Also the surgical and anaesthesiological procedures are described. The mean age of the patients was 32.2 years, and the mean period of desire for children 9.1 years. On average, six stimulation cycles were carried out. In an operation with a duration of approx. 20 minutes, an average of six oocytes were collected. As an alternative to general anaesthesia, an analgosedation, given intravenously with midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2 micrograms/kg) has been described. This necessitates continuous anaesthesiological monitoring due to respiratory depression, induced by the risk of medication. In our study, IVF patients who had a long history of desire for children, in some cases with several previous operations, show a low to moderate anxiety level before the operation. \"Hospital routine\" has evidently led to this low anxiety level, which is maintained after the operation.", 
    "7": "An in vitro study of the antinematodal action of two groups of compounds which act on the receptor complex of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mammalian systems is described. The compounds, Ivermectin and two benzodiazepines, Diazepam and a water soluble Midazolam were tested singly or in combination against two microfilarial parasites Onchocerca lienalis (closely related to Onchocerca volvulus) and Brugia pahangi. The combination of ivermectin and diazepam at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml and 33 micrograms/ml respectively achieved the same effect on microfilarial motility as when ivermectin was given at 1 microgram/ml alone or diazepam at 66 micrograms/ml alone. Similarly when the combination of ivermectin at 0.1 microgram/ml and midazolam at 10 micrograms/ml was used it achieved the same effect as ivermectin at 1 microgram/ml alone or midazolam at 33 micrograms/ml alone. This showed that both benzodiazepines had a synergistic effect on the activity of ivermectin. The microfilariae of B. pahangi were insensitive to both groups of compounds at all concentrations used.", 
    "8": "Cases of hexapropymate poisoning requiring intensive care in an urban region of Sweden (420,000 inhabitants) were collected over 2.5 years (1985 to 1987). Only patients with serum hexapropymate concentrations above 5.5 mg/L (30 mumol/L) and with a negative history for intake of tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, barbiturates, antihistaminic drugs and opiates were included. Clinical data about 8 intoxication events in 6 patients were evaluated retrospectively. Initial symptoms included coma, hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoventilation. Maximum coma depth (Glasgow coma score) was 3 to 5 in 5 out of 8 events. On 7 occasions assisted ventilation was required (for 12 hours or more in 5 events). There was no relationship between serum concentrations of hexapropymate and severity of clinical symptoms. All patients survived. Detailed analysis of the drug elimination in one patient showed a terminal elimination half-life of 21 hours, which is longer than previously reported (5 hours). The indications for use of this hypnotic drug may vary between doctors since an 8-fold variation was seen in drug prescription between Swedish counties in 1987. Poisoning with hexapropymate is a serious condition which may require symptomatic treatment in the intensive care unit. The clinical picture is similar to that seen in patients with burbiturate intoxication. There is no role for active forced elimination of the drug. It is questionable whether the clinical value of the drug is outweighted by its toxicity.", 
    "9": "Accumulation of TIS1 and TIS11 (Lim et al.: Oncogene 1:263-270, 1987) mRNAs in secondary cultures of rat neocortical astrocytes was much greater in response to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) than in response to either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In contrast, EGF, FGF, and TPA were equally effective in inducing accumulation of TIS8 and TIS28/c-fos mRNAs. These data suggested that TPA and the polypeptide mitogens might induce TIS gene expression by distinct pathways. When maximally inducing concentrations of EGF and FGF were co-administered to astrocyte cultures, TIS mRNA accumulations were no greater than those observed for the individual growth factors, suggesting that EGF and FGF saturate a common, limiting step in their induction pathways. In contrast, when either EGF or FGF was presented to astrocytes in combination with maximally inducing levels of TPA, the resulting levels of accumulation of TIS mRNAs were at least as great as the sum of the levels induced by the individual mitogens. Stimulation of [3H]-thymidine incorporation demonstrated an identical pattern of interaction; EGF and FGF co-administration was no more effective than either polypeptide mitogen alone, but, when presented to astrocyte cultures along with maximally inducing concentrations of TPA, either EGF or FGF was able to increase incorporation of [3H]-thymidine. Superinduction of all the TIS genes occurred if cycloheximide (CHX) was present during TPA exposure. Once again, two distinct classes of responses of the various TIS genes occurred; superinduction of TIS1, TIS7, TIS11, and TIS28/c-fos mRNA accumulation ranged from 10- to 20-fold, while CHX superinduction of TIS8 and TIS10 was far more modest, ranging from 2- to 3-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "I.v. midazolam was compared with inhalation sedation using isoflurane in 80 dental outpatients. Preoperative anxiety was comparable in both groups and decreased after operation to similar values. The dental surgeon and the patients rated the techniques as equally satisfactory. Midazolam produced faster induction of sedation (P less than 0.001) and more amnesia for the injection of local analgesic (P less than 0.001), whereas isoflurane produced more euphoria (P less than 0.01) and quicker recovery (P less than 0.001). The incidence of postoperative side effects was similar in the two groups.", 
    "11": "The induction dose-response of midazolam was compared with the dose-response of its combination with methohexitone sodium and with that of methohexitone alone. Three groups of 60 unpremedicated ASA physical state I or II women undergoing minor gynaecological interventions were studied. The end-point of induction of anaesthesia was inability to open eyes upon command. Dose-response curves were determined for each group with a probit procedure and compared with an isobolographic analysis. Midazolam was found to act in synergism with methohexitone for induction of anaesthesia. Twenty-seven percent ED50 for methohexitone was required in combination with 33% of ED50 for midazolam to achieve the ED50 of the combination. This degree of synergism is in agreement with that described in animal research.", 
    "12": "The imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro15-4513, has been shown to antagonize some of the behavioral effects of ethanol (ETOH). In rats having relatively little experience in the open field, the actions of ETOH (0.75 g/kg IP), Ro15-4513 (1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, IP), and Ro15-4513 in combination with ETOH were measured on horizontal activity. Rats receiving ETOH showed a significant depression in horizontal activity. Doses of Ro15-4513 given alone produced no significant differences in activity from baseline levels. Rats pretreated with Ro15-4513 prior to receiving ETOH, however, showed a significant attenuation of the ETOH induced depression of activity. These results indicate that Ro15-4513 is effective in attenuating the depressive effects of ETOH in the open field in rats having little experience in the apparatus.", 
    "13": "The hypothesis that chronic treatment with diazepam or with ethanol reduces behavioral variability, was tested on rats in a radial maze. Eight groups (n = 6) of male Sprague-Dawley rats were given one of eight treatments of diazepam (0.0, 1.5, 3.0 or 6.0 mg/kg, IP, -30 min) or of 10% ethanol (0.0, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 g/kg, IP, -15 min) for 2 sessions of baseline and 18 sessions of acquisition. Each session consisted of 3 trials of 8 rewards each. Emptied food wells were immediately rebaited so that an entry into any arm produced a reward of 2 food pellets. Both diazepam and ethanol produced a dose-dependent reduction in the variability of arm choice, reduction in the variability of angle of turn between arms, and reduction in the variability of goal-directed behavior. Correlations between these measures suggested they were not independent. The implications of these reductions in behavioral variability for other effects of anxiolytic drugs are described.", 
    "14": "The biomechanical basis of diazepam (Valium/Roche)-induced neural tube defects in the chick was investigated using a combination of electron microscopy and morphometry. Embryos at stage 8 (four-somite stage) of development were explanted and grown for 6 hr in nutrient medium containing 400 micrograms/ml diazepam. Nearly 80% of these embryos exhibited neural tube defects that were most pronounced in the forming midbrain region and typified by a \"relaxation\" or \"collapse\" of neural folds. The hindbrain and spinal cord regions were less affected. Electron microscopy revealed that neuroepithelial cells in diazepam-treated embryos had smoother apical surfaces and broader apical widths than did controls. Morphometric measurements supported this observation and further showed that these effects were focused at sites within the wall of the forming neural tube that typically exhibit the greatest degree of bending and apical constriction (i.e., the floor and midlateral walls). Overall results indicate that neural tube defects associated with exposure to diazepam are due largely to a general inhibition of the contractile activity of apical microfilament bundles in neuroepithelial cells. These findings 1) emphasize the important contribution of microfilament-mediated apical constriction of neuroepithelial cells in providing the driving forces for bending of the neuroepithelium during neural tube formation and 2) suggest that agents or conditions that impair their contractile activity could play a role in the pathogenesis of certain types of neural tube defects.", 
    "15": "We studied the effects of drugs on urinary bladder contraction in unanesthetized (UA) rats using the same method as that previously employed to investigate similar effects in urethane and alpha-chloralose-anesthetized (A) rats. The surgical procedure was performed under halothane anesthesia, and after the recovery, the rats were restricted in a Ballman cage during the experiment. The pattern of the cystometrogram obtained in UA rats was very similar to that in A rats, and almost the same pattern was maintained for at least three hours. Baclofen (10 mg/kg, i.p.), morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and pentobarbital (20 mg/kg, i.p.) completely inhibited the bladder contraction at doses only double those at which the same drugs inhibited the bladder contraction in A rats when i.v. injected. When the bladder pressure rose almost to the level of the peak pressure existing before injection of these drugs, the instilled solution leaked from the penis. On the other hand, even after injection of diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) at a dose five times greater than the minimum amount necessary for complete inhibition of bladder contraction in A rats, the bladder contraction accompanying micturition continued in UA rats. It appears that the inhibitory effect of diazepam on bladder contraction in rats is potentiated by anesthesia.", 
    "16": "1. Kinetic, saturation and competition binding studies were conducted on the muscarinic receptor binding site labelled by [3H]-N-methylscopolamine [( 3H]-NMS) in intact PC12 cells and cell membranes. Similar studies were conducted on M1 receptors of rat cortex labelled with [3H]-pirenzepine and M2 and M3 receptors present in rat heart and submaxillary gland respectively, and labelled with [3H]-NMS. 2. The dissociation of [3H]-NMS from muscarinic receptors in PC12 cells was slower than dissociation from both M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors. 3. The Kd of [3H]-NMS in the PC12 cells was significantly lower than that obtained at the M2 and M3 receptor. 4. In competition studies the affinity data for pirenzepine, hexahydroadiphenine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide were consistent with the presence of an M3 receptor in the PC12 cells. However, for AF-DX 116, cyclohexylphenyl(2-piperidinoethyl)silanol and methoctramine affinity estimates in PC12 cells were 3-6 fold lower than at the M3 receptor. 5. On the basis of these data we conclude that the muscarinic receptor present in the PC12 cells differs from the M1, M2 and M3 subtypes already described.", 
    "17": "1. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP, 10(-10)-3 x 10(-6) M) produced a concentration-dependent contractile response in guinea-pig trachea which was enhanced by both the mechanical removal of the epithelium and by indomethacin (10(-5) M), with an EC50 of 6.18 +/- 0.10 x 10(-8) M. 2. Sub-threshold concentrations of CCK-OP, which did not alter the resting tone of the smooth muscle, did not alter responses produced to electrical field stimulation (EFS) or to vagal nerve stimulation in an intact tracheal tube preparation. Atropine (2 x 10(-6) M) did not alter the concentration-response curve to CCK-OP, indicating that CCK-OP contraction is not mediated by cholinergic mechanisms. 3. The inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (endopeptidase-24.11) by phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) gave a leftward shift in the CCK-OP concentration-response curve in tissues with intact epithelium obtained from normal animals, but had no effect in tissues denuded of epithelium or in tissues obtained from animals which had been actively sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OA). 4. CCK-OP-induced contractile responses were antagonized by the CCK-receptor antagonists dibutyryl cyclic guanosine monophosphate (pA2 = 4.3) and L-364,718 (pA2 = 9.6). 5. CCK-OP induced bronchoconstriction in large, but not small, human airways and was antagonized by the CCK-receptor antagonist L-364,718. CCK-OP had no effect on cholinergic neural responses elicited by EFS in human airways.", 
    "18": "Use of the intraosseous (i.o.) route as an alternative venous access for drug administration has increased. This study examined the efficacy of i.o. lorazepam (LZP) in suppressing pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure activity in pigs. Domestic swine (13-20 kg) were prepared for recordings of arterial blood pressure, EEG, and electrocortical activity. Seizure activity was induced by PTZ (100 mg/kg i.v.). Sixty seconds after onset of seizure activity, animals either received no drug (control) or LZP (1.0 mg/kg) administered i.v. or i.o. via an 18- or 13-gauge spinal needle inserted in the right proximal tibia. Both i.o. and i.v. LZP significantly suppressed the duration of seizure activity (DSA) (s/min interval) within 1 min following drug administration: DSA control, 46.2 +/- 3.6; i.v. LZP, 25.0 +/- 5.1; i.o. (18-gauge) LZP, 27.6 +/- 6.0; i.o. (13-gauge) LZP, 24.0 +/- 2.4. Seizure activity was essentially abolished at 1 min following LZP infusion. In addition, both i.v. and i.o. LZP did not have significant effects on the basal heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. The data demonstrate that in swine (1) the i.o. route is an effective alternative venous access for LZP administration, and (2) the size of spinal needles does not affect the antiepileptic efficacy of i.o. infusion of LZP.", 
    "19": "Intravenous (i.v.) access for administration of antiepileptic drugs can be time-consuming and difficult in an infant during a seizure. This study examined the intraosseous (i.o.) route as an alternative means of vascular access for drug administration in an animal-seizure model. Domestic swine (13-20 kg) were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg i.m.) and alpha-chloralose (80 mg/kg i.v.) and given gallamine (4 mg/kg i.v.) to prevent muscle fasciculations. Tracheosotomies were performed and the animals were ventilated with a Harvard respirator. The left femoral vein was cannulated and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (100 mg/kg) was given to elicit epileptogenic activity. Sixty seconds after onset of epileptogenic activity, the animals received saline or diazepam (DZP) (0.1 mg/kg) or propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) i.v. or via the i.o. route (18-gauge spinal needle placed in the right proximal tibia). Both DZP and propranolol were effective in suppressing epileptogenic activity via the i.v. or i.o. routes. Thus, the i.o. route is a rapid and effective alternative route for the administration of antiepileptic drugs when an i.v. route cannot be readily established.", 
    "20": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes in human, guinea pig and rat lung tissue were characterized by radioligand binding, and functional studies were carried out on guinea pig and rat tissues. Control binding experiments were performed with membranes from human tissues rich in M1 (hippocampus), M2 (pons-medulla) and M3 (salivary gland) receptor subtypes. Competitive binding experiments with atropine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide did not reveal any tissue selectivity of these ligands. Pirenzepine, a selective M1 antagonist with 11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX116), a selective M2 antagonist, made it possible to characterize muscarinic subtypes. In hearts from the three species, the low affinity for pirenzepine and the high affinity for AF-DX116 were related to M2 receptors. In rat lung, the high affinity for AF-DX116 and the intermediate affinity for pirenzepine indicate M2 and M3 subtypes. Guinea pig and human lung tissues contain 48 and 67%, respectively, of muscarinic binding sites with high affinity for pirenzepine (M1). The second muscarinic receptor population in human lung might be classified as M3 in view of the cardioselectivity of AF-DX116, but the occurrence of M2 cardiac-type receptors could not be excluded. In guinea pig lung, both M2 and M3 subtypes might occur in addition to M1 receptors. Muscarinic stimulation led to the contraction of guinea pig and rat lung strips but did not significantly affect human lung strips. We suggest that presynaptic M2-muscarinic receptors modulated the M3-induced contraction in the guinea pig lung smooth muscle.", 
    "21": "The effects of i.c.v. administration of diisopropylfluorophosphate on drinking activity, urine volume and urinary electrolyte excretion were examined in the conscious, unrestrained rat. An i.c.v. dose of 5 micrograms of diisopropylfluorophosphate was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in five nuclei in the anterior, dorsal portion of the hypothalamus. This dose of diisopropylfluorophosphate also resulted in a dipsogenic episode, a diuresis and a biphasic effect on urinary sodium and potassium excretion. Each response was independent of the other two responses. The responses were mediated by muscarinic cholinergic receptors other than nicotinic receptors as they were blocked by both atropine and pirenzepine but not mecamylamine. The results suggest that the muscarinic receptors responsible are probably of muscarinic receptor M1 class.", 
    "22": "Six healthy volunteers received a single i.v. dose of 'low dose' lorazepam (0.0225 mg/kg), 'high dose' lorazepam (0.045 mg/kg) and placebo by 1-min infusion in a double-blind three-way crossover study. Plasma concentrations were measured 24 hr after dosage, and the EEG power spectrum was simultaneously computed by fast-Fourier transform to determine the percentage of total EEG amplitude occurring in the 13-30-Hz range. Low and high dose lorazepam did not differ significantly in distribution volume (1.89 versus 1.81 l/kg) or elimination half-life (11.5 versus 12.2 hr); clearance was slightly although significantly reduced at the higher dose (2.08 versus 1.88 ml/min/kg, P less than .005). EEG effects were of relatively slow onset, reaching their maximum change over baseline 30 min after infusion. The duration of action was prolonged, with the fraction of EEG activity in the 13-30-Hz range still significantly above baseline 8 hr after the 0.045 mg/kg dose. Five of these subjects received 0.15 mg/kg of i.v. diazepam in a companion study of identical design. EEG effects of diazepam were shorter than those of lorazepam, probably because of the more rapid and extensive decline in plasma diazepam concentrations in the postinfusion distribution phase. In addition, the onset of diazepam's effect was immediate. In male CD-1 mice that received i.v. diazepam (8.3 mg/kg) or lorazepam (3.3 mg/kg), the brain:plasma concentration ratio was maximal 2.5 min after dosage for diazepam, but equilibration was delayed at least 30 min after dosage for lorazepam. Thus the slow onset of action of lorazepam is probably attributable to slow entry into brain.", 
    "23": "The effects of neomycin and cholestyramine on the disposition of lorazepam was examined in seven healthy drug-free men. Half-life as determined for the oral route was, in all subjects, 15% to 35% less than that determined for the intravenous route. Free oral clearance was slightly but not significantly less than free systemic clearance, but the ratio of the AUC of lorazepam glucuronide corrected for dose was twofold greater by the oral route. Urinary recoveries also differed (71.6% and 50.4%, oral versus intravenous). Neomycin and cholestyramine treatment resulted in a 19% to 26% reduction in half-life attendant on a 34% increase in free oral clearance and a 24% increase in free systemic clearance. This suggests that lorazepam undergoes significant enterohepatic recirculation in human beings and that there exists an extrahepatic pathway, at least for the intravenous route. Since pharmacokinetic measurements do not take these physiologic processes into account, the drug cannot properly be used as a marker of conjugative metabolism.",

Midazolam was well tolerated without complications and provided dramatic control of the symptoms, suggesting an expanded role for it in the management of aggressive and violent behavior.", 
    "25": "The authors report three cases of panic disorder with agoraphobia in children, with characteristic panic attacks, separation anxiety, and fear and avoidance of crowds and public places. The panic and agoraphobic symptoms responded to medications effective with agoraphobic adults, i.e., imipramine and alprazolam.", 
    "26": "The authors assessed the effects of partial tapering followed by abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam, diazepam, and placebo in 40 patients with panic attacks. The anxiety scores and frequency of panic attacks of the three groups did not differ at the end of the initial 2-week taper, but 1 week after abrupt discontinuation of the remaining medication, patients formerly taking alprazolam had greater increases in anxiety but no more panic attacks than did the other patients. Because of low statistical power, differences in benzodiazepine half-lives, absence of multiple ratings, and imbalances between groups in clinical characteristics, these findings must be viewed as preliminary.", 
    "27": "Clinical observations suggest that patients with generalized anxiety disorder differ in somatic symptoms. The authors compared 28 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had high levels of cardiovascular complaints with 32 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had low levels of cardiovascular complaints on rating instruments, physiological measures, and use of anxiolytic medication. The two groups differed on somatic but not psychic symptoms on rating instruments. Patients with high levels of cardiovascular symptoms had higher levels of cardiac lability and required higher doses of alprazolam. These findings suggest that anxious patients with comparable levels of psychic anxiety may differ in levels of physical symptoms.", 
    "28": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) and its receptors are abundantly represented in the central nervous system. However, a specific role or mechanism of action for CCK in this context has not been established. CCK coexists with oxytocin in magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system, sharing common neurosecretory vesicles with oxytocin in the neural lobe of the pituitary. The neural lobe, which consists primarily of oxytocin- and vasopressin-containing axons and nerve terminals and their surrounding glia, provides a relatively simple model system allowing for the study of the regulation of neurosecretion at the nerve terminal level, free from the complex array of synaptic effects present throughout the rest of the central nervous system. In this paper, we demonstrate the presence of high-affinity CCK binding sites in the rat neural lobe and show that activation of these receptors by the sulfated octapeptide, CCK-8, and related peptides causes potent secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin from the isolated nerve terminals. The secretagogue action of CCK-8, which is blocked by a CCK receptor antagonist (L-364,718), is independent of electrical stimulation and extracellular calcium and is blocked by an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Thus, the action of CCK on the neural lobe provides an example of peptide ligand-induced neurosecretion apparently mediated by second messengers rather than depolarization-induced calcium influx.", 
    "29": "We withdrew phenytoin from 17 inpatients maintained on combination therapy with carbamazepine for complex partial seizures and analyzed seizure occurrence in relation to plasma levels and time from initiation of withdrawal. The ratio of maximum to mean weekly seizure frequency did not vary with initial level or rate of withdrawal. The week with most frequent seizures began a median of 10 days after phenytoin levels became undetectable, and mean daily seizure frequency was higher at undetectable than at falling levels for the entire 2- to 10-week study period. Four patients had a total of 6 clusters of generalized tonic-clonic seizures; only 2 occurred while levels were falling and the other 4 at 3, 9, 28, and 42 days after reaching undetectable levels. Our data argue against the occurrence of withdrawal seizures in these patients and suggest that worsening of seizures following phenytoin discontinuation more likely reflects loss of therapeutic drug effect than a true abstinence phenomenon.", 
    "30": "A random sample of 46 general practitioners of the Unit\u00e1 Sanitaria Locale in Torino recruited 802 elderly outpatients and collected information about complaints and current drug treatment. Within a week each patient received a home interview and details were collected on drug compliance and use of drugs other than those reported by the general practitioners. On average, each patient was taking 3.6 drugs, of which 2.9 were correctly reported by the general practitioners and 0.7 were unreported. Among the most prescribed therapeutic groups there were drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (cardiovascular drugs, diuretics, psychotropic agents) and substances whose efficacy has never been fully documented (\"cerebroactive-vasoactive\" agents). Age and number of complaints were positively and significantly correlated with number of prescribed drugs. Nearly half of the sample (44.4%)--more frequently women and people with higher education--were taking one or more drugs not detected by the general practitioners, often benzodiazepines taken over a long period for anxiety or insomnia. Full compliance occurred for 81.5% of the prescriptions and 59.9% of patients were correctly taking all prescribed drugs. Compliance was lower for prescriptions of the general practitioners compared with other doctors' prescriptions (eg, hospital doctor, private doctor) and probability of taking correctly all the prescribed drugs decreased with the number of medicines concurrently taken. The most common reason for noncompliance was fear of side effects.", 
    "31": "The authors present the case of a 21-year-old man with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) complicated by panic disorder, whose OCD and panic symptoms resolved during clonazepam treatment. Prior treatment with an equivalent dose of lorazepam had ameliorated his panic attacks without affecting his obsessions or compulsions. Clonazepam worked with a rapidity and completeness uncharacteristic of more established treatments for OCD.", 
    "32": "Fatal or near-fatal hydrogen peroxide ingestions are rarely encountered. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman who experienced seizure activity, respiratory arrest, and residual neurologic deficits after accidentally ingesting industrial-strength 35% hydrogen peroxide.", 
    "33": "We report four cases of unexpected cocaine intoxication in children manifested by the sudden development of seizures. Each patient presented with seizure activity of unknown etiology. Toxicology screens were positive for cocaine and its metabolites. All four had normal head computed tomography scans and have not required long-term use of anticonvulsants. One infant developed a mild learning disability. Cocaine intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new onset seizure activity in children. Child protection agencies should be consulted in all cases due to a high probability of abuse or neglect.", 
    "34": "Quazepam (QZP), a new long half-life benzodiazepine, seems to have a more specific hypnotic activity and a \"physiological\" mechanism of action. This study assessed its clinical efficacy and any withdrawal symptoms occurring after the treatment with QZP and triazolam (TRZ). Sixty-five patients (mean age 41.4 yrs +/- 12.43 SD) with sleep disorders were included in the study. The patients were treated with placebo for 4 days (run-in period) and if no amelioration of insomnia was observed, were then randomly allocated to 15 mg QZP (33 patients) or TRZ (32 patients) for 8 weeks and finally placebo for another week. Sleep quality, efficiency, side-effects and withdrawal effects were assessed by specific rating scales. In comparing data obtained from the two treatments, the following conclusions were drawn: 1) both drugs showed a hypnoinductive efficacy but patients treated with QZP had significantly fewer night awakenings; 2) at the end of treatment only patients treated with TRZ had longer awakenings and rebound symptoms; 3) a lower withdrawal symptom incidence was observed in patients treated with QZP. Therefore, QZP seems to have a good hypnotic effect without inducing withdrawal symptoms. In contrast TRZ turned out to be a merely hypno-inducing drug presenting higher risks of rebound effects after withdrawal.", 
    "35": "Cholinergic M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in aged and young rat brains were studied by quantitative autoradiography of tritiated QNB in the presence of pirenzepine or carbachol. A selective pattern of decreased binding density was observed in the aged rat. A large number of regions showed no effect of aging; these include subdivisions of the hippocampal formation and most thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. M1 and M2 receptors showed small but significant decreases in cortical regions and in the striatum. The largest effects were seen in M2 receptors of the ventral forebrain cholinergic nuclei where binding was reduced by up to 40%. No similar reductions were seen in the M1 receptor population in these regions. The results suggest that both muscarinic receptor subtypes show an anatomically selective pattern of decrease with age, with the M2 receptor subtype in the basal forebrain nuclei being specially vulnerable to the effects of aging.", 
    "36": "The pharmacological studies show that tianeptine (Stablon) is an original psychotropic drug. In classical and behavioural pharmacology, tianeptine has a novel antidepressant profile, different from other molecules and an anxiolytic effect but different from the benzodiazepines. Tianeptine does not cause sedation and sleeping troubles. In mice, tianeptine does not impair spatial memory but have facilitating effects on both working and reference memory. Tianeptine also increased the focalization of attention in cat and is active on comportmental adaptation models in stress. The electrophysiological data showed that tianeptine increases activity of the hippocampus pyramidal cells and decreases the recovery time after inhibitory substances application. Neurobiochemical studies showed that tianeptine increases serotonin uptake, in rat brain and in rat and human platelets, after acute and chronic treatment. Neuroendocrinology data showed that tianeptine decreases CRF and ACTH levels. Current research on the effect of tianeptine on acetylcholine could explain its anti-stress and memory facilitation activity.", 
    "37": "The effects of oxazepam on coordination and maximal seizure were compared between young (6-month-old) and old (24-month-old) BDF1 mice by using a rotorod test and a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure test, respectively. The apparent sensitivity to oxazepam's anticonvulsant effect, as examined by its effect on PTZ-induced maximal seizure, was increased in old animals of both sexes in comparison to young ones. The effect of oxazepam on coordination was also significantly greater in old male mice as compared with the young. The results of the present study, together with our past observations on other anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, strongly suggest that the anticonvulsant effect, as well as the effect on coordination, in mice generally increases with age.", 
    "38": "The effects of repeated diazepam administration (80 mg) were assessed across a 12-hr time course with humans responding under a two-component multiple schedule of repeated acquisition and performance of response sequences. Subjects resided in an inpatient clinical research ward for the duration of the study. In each component of the multiple schedule, subjects completed sequences of 10 responses in a predetermined order using three keys of a numeric keypad. In the acquisition component, a new response sequence was to be acquired each session. In the performance component, the response sequence always remained the same. After stable responding was obtained and the effects of the placebo assessed, diazepam was administered for 3 consecutive days. The effects of repeated diazepam administration on overall percentage of errors across the two components of the multiple schedule were selective. In the acquisition component, the first dose of diazepam increased percentage errors with the magnitude of effects decreasing across the second and third days of diazepam administration. In the performance component, the percentage of errors was either minimally affected across all 3 days of diazepam administration or substantively increased on Day 1 with subsequent diazepam administrations having minimal effects. Effects on response rate were not selective. Diazepam decreased rates of responding in both schedule components, with the magnitude of effects decreasing across successive administrations. These results replicate previous findings in humans and nonhumans on the selective effects of diazepam on acquisition versus performance baselines. Also, the results suggest that the selective effects do not result from differences in reinforcement rate. Finally, the present results demonstrate that the selective recovery from repeated drug administration previously demonstrated in nonhumans using a repeated acquisition arrangement has generality to human behavior.", 
    "39": "We developed algorithms for confirmation and identification of benzodiazepines and their metabolites, initially detected in urine samples by enzyme-multiplied immunoassay (EMIT). These algorithms are based on the pattern of benzophenone derivatives of benzodiazepines obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with use of a modified specific ion selection mode. Benzophenone derivatives were produced by acid hydrolysis of urine samples containing benzodiazepines and (or) their metabolites. We present mass spectra of the newer benzodiazepines--alprazolam, midazolam, and triazolam--and we determined the detection limit (0.2 mg/L) for these drugs as measured with the EMIT d.a.u. benzodiazepine assay and the ETS instrument (both from Syva Co.). We conclude that these algorithms are useful mostly in forensic toxicology in which unequivocal identification of benzodiazepines is the desired goal.", 
    "40": "Twenty-six children aged 4 to 15 years who were to receive cancer chemotherapy were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial that compared the antiemetic efficacy of a four-drug regimen (the MBDL regimen: metoclopramide, 8 mg/kg; benztropine, 0.04 mg/kg; dexamethasone, 0.7 mg/kg; lorazepam, 0.1 mg/kg), given over 24 hours, with the efficacy of chlorpromazine, 3.3 mg/kg, given in four doses over 24 hours. The MBDL regimen was more effective than chlorpromazine in both objective and subjective measures of antiemetic control. Of 26 children, 23 (89%) had less vomiting on the MBDL regimen, and 20 (77%) of 26 patients or parents preferred this regimen (p less than 0.01). The MBDL regimen reduced the number of vomiting episodes by a mean of 4.0 (p less than 0.01) and reduced the duration of vomiting by a mean of 3.7 hours (p less than 0.01). A moderate level of sedation was documented at some stage in the 24-hour period of observation in 27% on the MBDL regimen and in 35% receiving chlorpromazine. Dystonia was seen in 1 (4%) of 26 children. We conclude that the MBDL regimen is safe in children and more effective than chlorpromazine.", 
    "41": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex reversible syndrome that can progress to coma. Recently, behavioral and electrophysiologic ameliorations of HE have been reported to occur in animal models of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and, in uncontrolled studies, in a majority of patients with FHF or cirrhosis following the intravenous administration of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist, flumazenil. These observations, while not excluding a role for other mechanisms in the mediation of HE, raise the possibility that an endogenous BZ receptor ligand with agonist properties may contribute to the manifestations of HE by allosterically potentiating GABA-mediated neurotransmission.", 
    "42": "Visual potentials evoked by means of reversible checkerboard pattern were studied in 12 healthy subjects, 5 patients with probable multiple sclerosis and 3 patients with photosensitive epilepsy before and after intravenous injection of 10 mg of Valium. The most characteristic feature was lowering of the amplitude of the evoked visual potentials (in 75%) which appeared as a rule between 30 seconds and 4 minutes after Valium injection. Prolongation of Pmax latency was observed less frequently (in 65%) and this change was of low grade. In nearly half the cases sings of synchronization appeared with development of late multiphasic components of the visual evoked potential. No significant difference was noted in the effect of Valium on the latency and amplitude of the visual evoked potentials between healthy subjects and patients. The possible mechanisms of diazepam action on the conduction in visual pathways are discussed.", 
    "43": "The response to different therapeutic methods was evaluated in a series of 264 patients with blepharospasm. The most effective drug therapy were anticholinergic agents, which resulted in the initial improvement of symptoms in 20% of treated patients. There was improvement in isolated cases treated with levodopa, dopaminergic agonists, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. Bilateral avulsion of the facial nerve was carried out in 29 patients; 27 of these (93%) improved. Spasms relapsed in 22 cases, after a mean period of 12 months. Myectomy of the orbicular muscle was performed in 8 patients. In only 2 cases some improvement was obtained. One hundred and fifty-one patients were treated with infiltrations of botulinum toxin A in the orbicular muscle. 78% of cases improved. The mean duration of the benefit of each injection was 9.2 weeks. The most common secondary effects were local (ptosis, diplopia) and transient.", 
    "44": "Twelve systemically healthy patients each (ASA risk groups 1-2) who required oral surgery under local anesthesia received the short-acting benzodiazepin Midazolam for analgosedation as well as the analgesics Pentazocin or Piritramid. Both i.v. medications are suitable as adjuvants for local anesthesia since neither clinically relevant respiratory and circular depression nor major sleepiness were observed.", 
    "45": "The distribution of nicotinic and muscarinic receptor subtypes was examined in human brain tissue obtained at autopsy from neurologically normal adult (50-60 years) individuals. Membrane preparations from 15 brain regions were examined for nicotinic (L-[3H]nicotine) binding, both M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor binding (distinguished on the basis of pirenzepine affinity) and high (H) and low (L) affinity muscarinic agonist binding (distinguished on the basis of carbachol displacement). Total muscarinic receptor binding sites were relatively high in striatal and cortical areas, where both M1 subtype and agonist binding type L predominated, compared with thalamic, nigral and cerebellar regions and spinal cord, where the M2 subtype and agonist binding type H predominated. Nicotinic receptor binding sites (predominantly high affinity, measured at low ligand concentrations) did not parallel any of the muscarinic subtypes, being concentrated in thalamic, neocortical and striatal regions. Scatchard analysis indicated the presence of both high and low affinity nicotinic sites, the numbers of the latter generally exceeding the former by over one order of magnitude. Neither muscarinic nor nicotinic receptor binding sites were closely related to the distribution of the cholinergic neuronal marker, choline acetyltransferase, suggesting that individual cholinergic pathways may be distinguished by the relative proportion of the different types of cholinergic receptors present.", 
    "46": "We investigated the anti-ischemic effects of PK 11195 (RP 52028), a selective ligand for peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites in man. In a first series of patients, we did not find any hemodynamic effect of 10 mg (8 patients) or 20 mg (8 patients) of the intravenously administered drug. The anti-ischemic effect was evaluated on 16 patients with coronary heart disease and a positive stress test in a double blind study of 20 mg of intra-venous PK 11195 (8 patients) versus placebo (8 patients). Ischemia was induced by pacing, and assessed by ST segment depression and lactates extraction before and 15 minutes after administration of the drug. No statistical differences could be found on these ischemia indices between the placebo and PK 11195 treated groups. Although experimental studies have shown interaction of the drug with the calcium channels, our study did not demonstrate any anti-ischemic effect with the dosage used.", 
    "47": "Nondeprived, male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were adapted to a daily schedule of 2-hr access to a 10% sucrose solution. Two benzodiazepines, midazolam (1.0-10 mg/kg) and flurazepam (1.0-10 mg/kg), produced dose-dependent increases in sucrose consumption. In contrast, the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), had no effect on sucrose intake. Neither d-fenfluramine nor d-amphetamine affected sucrose ingestion in the hamsters, except at a large dose (10 mg/kg). Nevertheless, significant, dose-dependent reductions in sucrose consumption were observed after the administration of either opiate antagonists (naltrexone; nalmefene) or selective dopamine D2 receptor agonists (N-0437; quinpirole). The results are compared and contrasted with previously reported data for rats.", 
    "48": "To determine the role of CCK-A receptors in the cholecystokinin (CCK)-induced suppression of locomotor activity in the rat, the ability of the selective CCK-A receptor antagonist L364,718 to block these responses was investigated. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) (10, 100 micrograms/kg IP) and caerulein (1, 5, 10 micrograms/kg IP) produced marked reductions in locomotor activity whereas cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK4) (100 micrograms/kg IP) was without effect. The reductions in activity produced by CCK8 (10 micrograms/kg) and caerulein (10 micrograms/kg) were antagonized by L364,718 (100 micrograms/kg IP). In an open field test CCK8 (10 micrograms/kg IP) reduced locomotor activity and total number of rears and increased pause duration. These effects of CCK8 on open-field behaviour were also antagonized by L364,718 (100 micrograms/kg IP). It is concluded that L364,718 is a potent antagonist of the actions of CCK8 and caerulein on locomotor activity, suggesting that the effects of these peptides are mediated by a CCK-A receptor.", 
    "49": "We have previously shown that subjecting cardiomyopathic hamsters in the lesion-developing period of their heart disease to cold-immobilization stress had lethal consequences which could be blocked by alprazolam treatment. This experiment replicated that finding and also examined the efficacy of diazepam in this paradigm. In contrast to alprazolam, diazepam did not prevent the cardiomyopathic subjects from succumbing to the stressor. Thus, the effect of alprazolam in reducing stress-induced mortality did not reflect a generic benzodiazepine action.", 
    "50": "Ingestion of food in mice following training on T-maze footshock avoidance enhanced memory retention when tested 7 days later. This eating-induced improvement of retention was blocked by a specific cholecystokinin antagonist, L-364,718. The cholecystokinin antagonist prevented enhancement of memory retention resulting from posttraining administration of the gastrointestinal hormones, cholecystokinin, bombesin or gastrin releasing peptide. L-364,718 neither impaired or improved retention when given alone. Specificity of the effect of L-364,718 was demonstrated by the failure of L-364,718 to block improved memory retention resulting from administration of arecoline and D-amphetamine. The studies provide evidence that activation of cholecystokinin receptors plays a physiological role in the mediation of meal-induced enhancement of memory retention.", 
    "51": "Effects of benzodiazepines were investigated on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-induced modulation of the basal and veratridine-evoked catecholamine release from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. GABA by itself, caused catecholamine release and facilitated veratridine-evoked catecholamine release. Midazolam enhanced the GABA-evoked catecholamine release in a dose-related fashion and further facilitated the enhancement by GABA of the veratridine-evoked catecholamine release. Clonazepam, a selective central-type benzodiazepine receptor agonist, also enhanced the GABA-induced catecholamine release, whereas ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, reduced the GABA-evoked catecholamine release. The dose-response curve of the GABA-evoked catecholamine release was shifted to the left by midazolam without affecting the maximal response to GABA. Facilitation by midazolam and clonazepam of the GABA action or inhibition by ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate was antagonized by RO15-1788, which by itself had no effect on the basal or GABA- and veratridine-evoked catecholamine release. These results suggest that the central-type benzodiazepine receptor participates in the GABAergic modulation of the catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells.", 
    "52": "The heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors has been well supported by differential characteristics between pirenzepine and atropine both in receptor binding and in whole tissue pharmacology studies. Under these conditions pirenzepine has been classified as a selective receptor antagonist with high affinity for M1 receptors. The antisecretory properties of pirenzepine on gastric acid and pepsin secretion may be attributed to the antagonistic activity of the drug on muscarinic M1 receptors of gastric intramural plexuses, whereas the effect on parietal muscarinic M2 receptors seems of less importance. Additional inhibitory mechanisms on gastric secretion may be represented by pirenzepine-induced increase in somatostatin release from gastrointestinal system. Significant cytoprotective properties of pirenzepine have been observed on a variety of experimentally induced peptic ulcerations. This protective activity may be due to pirenzepine-induced increase in gastric mucosal blood flow as well as to the increase in gastric transmural electric potential difference. In accordance with this pharmacodynamic profile of pirenzepine, numerous clinical studies have revealed its efficacy in the treatment of both duodenal and gastric ulcerations. In addition to this, the clinical usefulness of the drug has been demonstrated in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, in stress ulceration, in acute gastrointestinal bleeding as well as in gastritis, duodenitis and non-ulcer dyspepsia. In most of the studies pirenzepine has been found to be well tolerated with a low incidence of antimuscarinic effects which may occur at salivary, ocular, cardiac and urinary sites. The clinical use of pirenzepine alone or in association with H2 blockers is recommended in the treatment of peptic ulcer patients, in the case of acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage and in patients non responders to H2 antagonists.", 
    "53": "An increased gastroenteric mucosal permeability is generally considered a pathophysiological mechanism in the urticaria-angioedema syndrome caused by adverse reactions to foods. Since pirenzepine, an antimuscarinic receptor drug, exerts a cytoprotective activity on digestive mucosa, the authors evaluated the clinical efficacy of pirenzepine and terfenadine (antihistamine), alone or associated, in the treatment of patients with urticaria-angioedema syndrome due to food allergy. Furthermore, additional endoscopy and biopsy studies were performed in order to provide experimental evidence about the cytoprotective activity of this treatment. The results of the present investigation confirm the clinical efficacy, with improvement of histological parameters, of pirenzepine treatment in adverse reactions to foods, as previously demonstrated by our group, and suggest further investigations on the functional mucosal impairment hypothesized in this pathological condition.", 
    "54": "Recent advances in respiratory neuropharmacology and neurophysiology have allowed the assessment of the effects of different drugs on the control of the ventilation both qualitatively (alterations of ventilatory pattern) and quantitatively (size and duration of the ventilatory and haemogasometric alterations). In the control mechanism of ventilation, the pharmacological intervention can act both on the respiratory input (basal metabolism, peripheral chemo-receptors, pulmonary receptors, bulbar neurons, cortical nervous system) and on the respiratory output (respiratory muscles). Based on personal experience in this field and the recent literature, the Authors briefly discuss the seat and the mechanism of action of the drugs with stimulating effect (respiratory analeptics, almitrines, progesterone, acetazolamide, salicylates, protriptyline, theophylline) and depressing effect (narcotics and narcotic-antagonists, anaesthetics, barbiturates and benzodiazepines) on the ventilation, as well as the role of the neurotransmitters and modulators. The clinical (positive and negative) effects of these drugs, particularly related to the patients with chronic lung disease, are also illustrated.", 
    "55": "The ability of temazepam and midazolam to substitute for pentobarbital and thus maintain the physical dependence state was used to assess the potential dependence liability of these two benzodiazepine compounds. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 175-200 g and having ad lib access to food and water, were determined to be dependent on pentobarbital following 12 days of continuous, intraperitoneal infusion of pentobarbital using an escalating drug infusion schedule. On day 13 (substitution phase) the pentobarbital was replaced with either temazepam, midazolam or vehicle and the rats were infused for an additional 24 hours. This was followed on Day 14 (withdrawal phase) by a 24 hr saline infusion period. Rats were observed for changes in overt behavior and alterations of body weight during both Day 13 and Day 14. Preliminary potency estimation studies had indicated that both drugs were more potent and longer acting than was pentobarbital. Temazepam, in doses of 32.5, 65 and 130 mg/kg/24 hr, was demonstrated to substitute for pentobarbital and provided dose-dependent suppression of overt behavioral signs indicative of withdrawal. Temazepam also suppressed the weight loss typically observed during withdrawal. Substitution of saline for temazepam resulted in an increased incidence of withdrawal signs and an approximate 10% decline in body weight. Midazolam, in doses of 60 and 120 mg/kg/24 hr, also substituted for pentobarbital and suppressed both overt behavior and weight loss. Following saline substitution on Day 14, a mild withdrawal syndrome was evident although body weight was noted to remain near control values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "In order to assess the effects of inverse benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists on brain function, computerized EEG (CEEG) analysis was performed in rats following the i.p. administration of SR 95195 (7-phenyl-3-methyl-1,2,4 triazolo-[4,3-b]pyridazine) and CGS 8216 (2-phenylpyrazolo-[4,3c]-quinoline-3-[5H]-one) two benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists (BRIAGs) and of flumazepil (Ro 15-1788), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (BRANT). The EEG effects of SR 95195 (3, 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg), CGS 8216 (10 and 30 mg/kg) and flumazepil (3, 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg) were compared to those of the psychostimulant drugs DL-amphetamine (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg), and caffeine (10 and 30 mg/kg) and those of aniracetam (100 and 300 mg/kg), a nootropic pyrrolidone derivative. The CEEG profiles of SR 95195, CGS 8216 and flumazepil were mainly characterized by a power increase in the 20-32 Hz frequency range and by a power reduction in the 8-16 Hz range. These effects were quite similar to those of the psychostimulants DL-amphetamine and caffeine as well as to those of the nootropic aniracetam. Other psychotropic drugs with CNS-depressant properties, namely diazepam (10 mg/kg p.o.), pentobarbital (30 mg/kg p.o.), chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg i.p.) and imipramine (10 mg/kg i.p.) induced quite different EEG power modifications. These results show that BRIAGs and BRANTs possess a marked intrinsic activity at the central level and suggest that this activity is CNS-activating in nature.", 
    "57": "The effects of temazepam 20 mg and placebo were compared for premedication in patients anaesthetized with propofol and alfentanil and undergoing day surgery. Temazepam 20 mg significantly reduced preoperative anxiety and increased recovery time. A series of computerized cognitive tasks revealed significant deficits in attention and memory following anaesthesia, which were increased in range and magnitude by temazepam, which were apparent 30 min after surgery and had largely, but not completely, recovered at 4 h. This study has demonstrated that computerized cognitive testing can identify a wider profile of impairments produced by temazepam than has been found in previous work using non-computerized techniques.", 
    "58": "Twenty-one patients with severe neuroleptic-induced akathisia resistant to antiparkinsonian medications were treated with oral clonazepam in an open trial. All the patients reported subjective improvement. We suggest that clonazepam is effective in managing neuroleptic-induced akathisia.", 
    "59": "Psychotropic drug use was evaluated in 2022 ambulatory elderly subjects in 1978-80 and again in 1984-86. Use of hypnotic drugs declined from 8.5 percent (n = 3234) in 1978-80 to 6.3 percent (n = 2681) in 1984-86 (p less than 0.01). Use of the long-acting hypnotic flurazepam decreased (p less than 0.01) and use of two short-acting drugs, triazolam and temazepam, increased. Prescribing of long half-life benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (p less than 0.01) and chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, halazepam, and prazepam as a group (p less than 0.01) decreased as well as the use of nearly all products containing barbiturates (p less than 0.01).", 
    "60": "In the present study, the distribution of benzodiazepine recognition site subtypes in the brain of the cat was investigated. To this aim, the binding properties of [3H]2-oxo-quazepam ([3H]2OXOQ) and [3H]beta-CCE, two ligands with preferential affinity for Type I benzodiazepine recognition sites, were compared to binding parameters for [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNT) in different areas of the cat brain. The ratio of [3H]2OXOQ to [3H]FNT binding sites indicated that, in the cerebellum, Type I sites accounted for 90% of the total number of benzodiazepine recognition sites. The cerebral cortex, thalamus and mesencephalic reticular formation had also a high proportion of Type I sites (73-78%), whilst the two subtypes were almost equally distributed in the hippocampus, amygdala and bulbar reticular formation. A similar distribution of subtypes of benzodiazepine recognition sites was indicated by the ratio of [3H]beta CCE to [3H]FNT binding sites for different areas of the brain. These results demonstrate the existence of heterogeneity of recognition sites for benzodiazepines in the brain of the cat and support the view that [3H]2OXOQ preferentially labels Type I sites.", 
    "61": "1. The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) and the beta-carboline ZK 93426 were compared in dogs before and after chronic treatment with diazepam. 2. In diazepam-naive dogs, the most prominent behavioural alterations occurring during or after i.v. infusion of Ro 15-1788 up to a dose of 20 mg kg-1 were transient sedation, ataxia, and 'hot foot' behaviour, whereas behavioural alterations observed after ZK 93426 were not different from those observed after i.v. infusion of vehicle alone. This indicates that, in contrast to Ro 15-1788, ZK 93426 did not exert partial agonistic activity at benzodiazepine receptors. 3. In dogs treated 3 times daily with diazepam, 1 mg kg -1 orally, for 1 week, both benzodiazepine antagonists precipitated abstinence symptoms but the number and severity of withdrawal signs induced by Ro 15-1788 were greater than with ZK 93426. 4. In dogs treated 3 times daily with diazepam, 2 mg kg-1 orally, for 2 weeks, severe abstinence symptoms were precipitated in all animals by infusion of either antagonist but differences were found in the type of the symptoms: Ro 15-1788 induced rigid postures or rigid walking with increased muscle tone, tremor, twitches and jerks, whereas ZK 93426 did not alter motility but induced generalized myoclonic jerks and tonic-clonic seizures. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure was also observed in one dog of the trial with infusion of Ro 15-1788. 5. Plasma level determinations during chronic treatment diazepam showed marked accumulation of the major active metabolite desmethyldiazepam, whereas diazepam levels were at least 15 times lower, which might suggest that desmethyldiazepam was responsible for the development of physical dependence on diazepam.", 
    "62": "L364,718, a potent and specific antagonist for peripheral cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, was used to determine its effect on plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) after administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG, a central vagal activator) and of bethanechol (a cholinergic receptor agonist). Six conscious dogs were used in this study. Intravenous injection of 2-DG (75 mg/kg) caused significant increases in plasma levels of PP and gastrin, but there was no significant rise in plasma levels of immunoreactive and bioactive CCK. Intravenous injection of L364,718 (20 nmol/kg) significantly inhibited the PP response stimulated by 2-DG injection by approximately 60% but did not affect gastrin. Plasma levels of PP were increased dose dependently by bethanechol infusion and were not altered significantly by injections of L364,718. The results indicate that L364,718 inhibits PP response stimulated by a central vagal activator (2-DG) but not by cholinergic receptor agonist (bethanechol). This study suggests that CCK might be involved in the neural control of PP release as a neurotransmitter but probably not as a final activator of PP cells in dogs.", 
    "63": "Four patients with panic disorder whose panic attacks responded to benzodiazepine treatment but who suffered persistent anxiety improved after addition of buspirone. Despite its lack of antipanic effect, buspirone may offer an adjunctive benefit when added to benzodiazepines in panic disorder.", 
    "64": "The biodistribution of 3H-PK 11195, an antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, was studied in mice. High accumulations of radioactivity in the heart, lung, spleen, kidney and adrenal were observed after intravenous injection of tracer amounts of 3H-PK 11195 into the mice. The radioactivity in the heart, lung, spleen, kidney and adrenal was significantly decreased by the coadministration of carrier PK 11195, which indicated that PK 11195 specifically binds to the receptors. No radioactive metabolites were observed in the heart, lung and brain 20 min after intravenous administration of 3H-PK 11195. The accumulation of 3H-PK 11195 in the lung was not affected by pretreatment with either alpha-methyl benzylamine or imipramine, suggesting that 3H-PK 11195 specifically binds to the receptors. The ratios of radioactivity of the kidney, adrenal and spleen to blood increased as a function of time, whereas that of the lung and heart rapidly reached to a steady state. 11C-PK 11195 was synthesized by the N-methylation of desmethyl precursor yielding more than 100 mCi with high specific activity (more than 1.4 Ci/mumol). The labeling and purification procedure was completed within 23 min after the end of bombardment (EOB). The 11C-PK 11195 solution for injection seems to have a high potential for the in vivo study of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in the living human by means of positron emission tomography (PET).", 
    "65": "The partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist Ro15-4513 has been shown to antagonize many of ethanol's actions, including the reduction of behavior reinforced with ethanol presentation. The studies reported here compared the effects of the Ro compound on sucrose reinforcement alone and concurrently available with ethanol reinforcement. Also, a second inverse agonist, FG 7142, was tested. The result indicated that ethanol reinforcement was more sensitive to the inverse agonists compared to sucrose reinforcement. This was seen as a graded effect upon ethanol responding at doses which failed to have any effect upon sucrose-reinforced behavior. The Ro compound was approximately three times more potent than the FG compound in suppressing ethanol-reinforced responding. Possible explanations for the greater sensitivity of ethanol reinforcement compared to sucrose reinforcement was discussed in terms of ethanol's potential actions at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex.", 
    "66": "The paper deals with analysis of the influence of blockade of separate components of benzodiazepine-GABA-ionophore complex on the recovery of memory trace amnesia under GABA-A and GABA-B receptors activation in the experiments with conditioned reaction of passive avoidance of mice. Activation of GABA-A receptors did not change the behavioural amnesia manifestation at all terms of testing. Activation of GABA-B receptors before learning and amnestic influence caused spontaneous recovery of avoidance reaction. Blockade of chloride channel by picrotoxin and of benzodiazepine receptor by flumazepil restored the reproduction of the memory trace disturbed against the background of GABA-B receptors activation. Systemic flumazepil administration contributed to the memory trace reproduction against the background of GABA-A receptors activation by muscimol in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. In conditions of amnesia development against the background of muscimol in the dose of 1 mg/kg the blockade of any component of benzodiazepine-GABA-ionophore complex was not effective. The obtained data testify that activation of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors changes the amnesia development and correction of amnesia memory trace by the blockade of separate components of benzodiazepine-GABA-ionophore complex.", 
    "67": "The interaction of stress and ethanol with the GABA/BZ receptor system was evaluated in LS and SS mice. The effects of two separate in vivo treatments, a 2.5 g/kg injection of ethanol or a behavioral stressor, on GABA-enhanced [3H]-FNZ binding were nearly identical in both lines of mice. A 2.5 g/kg ethanol- or stress-pretreatment resulted in increased enhancement in SS cortex, but not LS. In cerebellum, treatment effects were demonstrated in both SS and LS mice. Intraperitoneal injections of increasing doses of ethanol produced biphasic stimulation of GABA-enhanced [3H]-FNZ binding in LS brain regions, but not SS. Adrenalectomies performed one week prior to ethanol administration produced a loss of ethanol enhancement in cerebellum of both lines. However, in cortex, removal of the adrenals had no effect. The in vitro addition of 30 mM ethanol to brain preparations incubated at 37 degrees C from stressed and unstressed animals resulted in greater enhancement of binding in cortex, but not cerebellum of stressed mice. Differences in the degree of enhancement between the lines of mice were lost if the animals were stressed prior to sacrifice or if membrane preparations were incubated at 4 degrees C. The results of this study suggest that the interaction between ethanol and stress is mediated by the GABAergic system, but responses vary dependent on brain region, dose of ethanol, and degree of ethanol sensitivity.", 
    "68": "In this investigation an attempt was made to evaluate quantitatively the relationship between benzodiazepine receptor occupancy and the anticonvulsant effect of flunitrazepam in rats. A graded measure of anticonvulsant effect was obtained on the basis of an elevation of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) threshold concentrations. The concentration-anticonvulsant effect relationship could be described by the Emax model with an EC50 in cerebrospinal fluid of 2.9 +/- 0.8 micrograms/liter and an Emax of 227 +/- 22 mg/liter PTZ (mean +/- SE). In vitro receptor occupancy was determined in a crude brain homogenate at 0 and 37 degrees C, which yielded KD values of 2.2 +/- 0.2 and 26 +/- 2 micrograms/liter, respectively. The results obtained in both experiments were combined by focusing on free flunitrazepam concentrations. This strategy resulted in a nonlinear relationship between receptor occupancy and anticonvulsant effect of flunitrazepam, with 90% of the maximum response achieved at a degree of receptor occupancy of approximately 50% at 37 degrees C.", 
    "69": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor has been classified into two receptor subtypes (GABAA and GABAB receptors) based on their pharmacological properties. The GABAA receptor in the central nervous system (CNS) has been found to be coupled structurally as well as functionally with the benzodiazepine receptor and Cl- channel. Purified GABAA receptor from bovine brain consisted of both alpha and beta subunits. The complementary DNAs encoding the GABAA receptor alpha and beta subunits have been cloned; and from their elucidated nucleotide sequences, the amino acid sequences of the subunits were deduced. The structure of both subunits, having four putative membrane domains, has been found to be similar to other ligand-gated receptors such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit and glycine receptor 48K subunit. Therefore, it has been suggested that these ligand-gated receptors comprise a superfamily. In addition, the presence of similarities in the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human brain GABAA receptor with those of bovine brain has been noted. On the other hand, the GABAB receptor, which is insensitive to bicuculline but sensitive to baclofen, has been found to be pharmacologically distinct from the GABAA receptor. The GABAB receptor in the brain has been found to be coupled with GTP-binding protein and generates the inhibitory transmission coupled with various intracellular effector systems such as adenylate cyclase and phosphoinositides turnover. The exact structure and function of the GABAB receptor in the CNS, however, remain to be clarified in future studies.", 
    "70": "By a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study, the ability of a series of 1-arylpyrazolo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-ones to displace specific [3H]-flunitrazepam from bovine brain membranes is shown to be significantly correlated with steric and hydrophobic constants of aryl subtituents, suggesting that substituents of 2- and 6-positions produce dominant steric effects and that those of 3- and 5-positions are involved in strong hydrophobic interaction with the receptor.", 
    "71": "The neuropeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is an endogeneous allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors at the benzodiazepine recognition site. Recent theories on the neurochemical cause for hepatic encephalopathy have implicated activation of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA systems. In 20 patients with hepatic disease, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of ammonia and amino acids were measured. As in previous studies there was a selective elevation of CSF amino acids as well as a correlation between CSF glutamine levels and encephalopathy. CSF DBI levels were maximally elevated 5-fold in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, but they were normal in those patients with liver disease not associated with changes in mental status and in patients with nonhepatic encephalopathy. Levels of DBI correlated with the clinical staging of hepatic encephalopathy. These data suggest that DBI may participate in the modulation of cerebral function in hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "72": "The potency of dihydroergotamine (DHE) was determined at 13 neurotransmitter receptors using radioligand binding techniques. DHE is a potent agent (i.e. affinity value less than 100 nM) at 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A), 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, dopamine2, alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic binding sites. DHE displays moderate affinity (i.e. affinity values = 100 - 1000 nM) for beta-adrenergic and dopamine1 sites and is completely inactive at 5-HT3, muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. These results were then compared to similar data on sumatriptan (formerly called GR 43175), a novel acute anti-migraine agent. The only pharmacological property shared by both agents is high affinity for 5-HT1D and 5-HT1A receptors. Therefore, these data suggest that 5-HT1D and/or 5-HT1A receptors may play an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine.", 
    "73": "Pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that benzodiazepines can modulate the ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) associated with social separation of rat pups. In this study, in vivo receptor autoradiography was used to determine if brain benzodiazepine receptors were functionally less available to bind an exogenous ligand during social separation. The labeled benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. 3H-RO 15-1788, was given to 10-day-old rat pups with varying schedules of social separation. In initial studies with homogenized and solubilized tissue, we found a 30% reduction in binding to cortex when pups were separated for 25 min beginning 5 min prior to tracer injection. In subsequent autoradiographic studies with this same separation schedule, the binding of 3H-RO 15-1788 was examined in 21 brain regions. Again binding was decreased in neocortex (frontal, motor, and somatosensory). In addition, we found significantly decreased binding in hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and superior and inferior colliculi. These same regions showed no alteration of in vitro binding of 3H-RO 15-1788. Therefore, these decreases in in vivo binding do not reflect changes in receptor number. The interpretation of decreased in vivo binding and implications of these results for defining the neural substrates of separation behavior are discussed.", 
    "74": "Many vasoactive agents have been shown to bind to specific receptors on endothelial cells. Among these is atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Binding of ANF to endothelial cells has been demonstrated to induce elevation of intracellular guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). Other vasoactive agents have been shown to cause elevation of intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), Ca, and diacylglycerol. However, the endothelial cell response that occurs subsequent to elevation of cGMP or other second messengers is not well understood. Recently, endothelial cells have been shown to possess a Na-K-Cl cotransport system that is stimulated by vasopressin and bradykinin and inhibited by isoproterenol. Thus it is possible that modulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport may play a role in the endothelial cell response to second messengers that are elevated by ANF and other vasoactive agents. This possibility was examined in the present study by evaluating the effects of a variety of vasoactive agents and their second messengers on endothelial cell Na-K-Cl cotransport. Cotransport was assessed as bumetanide-sensitive K influx in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. A number of agents were found to reduce Na-K-Cl cotransport, including ANF, acetylcholine, histamine, and norepinephrine. Cotransport was found to be stimulated by angiotensin II, as well as vasopressin and bradykinin. Na-K-Cl cotransport was also inhibited by elevation of intracellular cGMP or cAMP or by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester to activate protein kinase C. However, A23187-induced elevation of intracellular Ca caused stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "The role of noradrenaline in the anxiogenic action of the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist methyl-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) was assessed in a drug discrimination procedure using yohimbine as the stimulus cue and a conflict procedure using a conditioned behavioral suppression paradigm in rats. The yohimbine cue was antagonized by clonidine (0.03-0.5 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.1-10.0 mg/kg). DMCM (0.1-0.7 mg/kg) only partially substituted for the yohimbine stimulus cue. However, DMCM, in a smaller dose (0.1 mg/kg), significantly shifted the dose-effect curve of the yohimbine cue to the left. This potentiating effect of DMCM on the yohimbine cue was antagonized by Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and by the type I benzodiazepine receptor agonist CL218,872. In the conditioned behavioral suppression paradigm, both clonidine (0.03 mg/kg) and diazepam (3 mg/kg) had an anticonflict effect by increasing responses in the conditioned fear period, whereas DMCM (0.1, 0.5 mg/kg) decreased the responses of rats in the conditioned fear period. This proconflict effect of DMCM was antagonized by muscimol (0.5 mg/kg), a type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, Ro 15-1788 (3 mg/kg) and clonidine (0.01 mg/kg). Our results suggest that the depressive effect of DMCM on the function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex may cause increased noradrenergic activity, which may, in turn, be one of the anxiogenic mechanisms in DMCM.", 
    "76": "Delivery of cholesterol to inner mitochondrial membranes is rate-limiting for steroidogenesis in the zona fasciculata of adrenal cortex. A protein that stimulates this process was isolated to homogeneity from bovine adrenal tissue. This protein's primary structure has been determined in its entirety by a combination of automated Edman microsequencing, fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). The sequence was identical to that previously reported for bovine brain endozepine, except that it lacks the last two residues, -Gly-Ile, at the C terminus. To our knowledge, isolation of an endozepine-related protein from a tissue other than brain has not been reported previously. Endozepine competes with benzodiazepines for saturable binding sites in synaptosomes and in mitochondria of specific peripheral tissues. Previous reports have localized the adrenal benzodiazepine receptor to the outer mitochondrial membrane. In this report, we show that the prototypic benzodiazepine, diazepam, effects a stimulation of adrenal mitochondrial cholesterol delivery similar to that observed for endozepine. The effective diazepam concentration was consistent with that previously shown to displace a high-affinity ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor. The action of diazepam in adrenal mitochondria suggests that the mediation of corticotropin-induced steroidogenesis may be the physiological function of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. These studies provide new insights into the previously unknown function of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and should allow new investigations into the stimulation of steroidogenesis by endozepines and benzodiazepines in the brain and in certain peripheral tissues.", 
    "77": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands were utilized to selectively image intracerebrally implanted C6 gliomas, RG-2 gliomas, and Walker 256 metastatic tumors by means of quantitative autoradiography. Intravenous injections of 3H-PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide) or 3H-flunitrazepam in combination with clonazepam revealed high densities of peripheral benzodiazepine binding in glial tumors, with less binding in metastatic tumors. Peripheral binding was displaced by preadministration of excess PK11195. Topographical correlation was excellent between areas of histologically verified tumor and high densities of peripheral benzodiazepine binding. The choroid plexus, ependyma, and pineal gland also showed a moderate level of binding, but there was little binding in other normal brain structures or necrotic tissue. Binding densities were three- to fivefold higher in C6 glial tumors compared to normal cortex. Injection of 3H-flunitrazepam alone, which binds to both central and peripheral receptors, had the advantage of showing normal anatomic structures in addition to a clear definition of tumor topography. The potential value of peripheral benzodiazepine ligands in selectively imaging brain tumors in man with positron emission tomography is discussed.", 
    "78": "Sixty previously untreated patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stage lung cancer (21 small-cell, 39 non-small-cell) received chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. Bleomycin was also used in the patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. During the first cycle of chemotherapy, 30 patients received antiemetic therapy with intermittent metoclopramide (regimen A), and the other 30 patients received continuous infusion metoclopramide (regimen B). During the second course of chemotherapy, patients were switched to the alternate regimen. Regimen A consisted of lorazepam, 1 mg, orally; dexamethasone, 10 mg, intravenously (IV) every four hours for three doses; diphenhydramine, 0.5 mg/kg, IV every four hours for three doses; metoclopramide, 1 mg/kg, IV bolus every two hours for six doses. Regimen B was identical to A except metoclopramide was administered as 1 mg/kg, IV bolus followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h for ten hours. Fifty-eight patients completed both antiemetic regimens. Thirty-nine of the 58 patients had total control of acute nausea and vomiting (0-1 episodes) with regimen A or B. Fourteen patients had poor control of acute nausea and vomiting (more than one episode) with regimen A but total control with regimen B. Five patients had poor control with either regimen. Dystonic reactions, akathisia, or diarrhea occurred in 20 of the 58 patients on regimen A, but in only eight of the 58 patients on regimen B. Compared with intermittent bolus, continuous infusion metoclopramide is more effective in total control of acute nausea and vomiting and has less toxicity.", 
    "79": "Three days after systemic administration of kainic acid (15 mg/kg, s.c.), selected cholinergic markers (choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and high-affinity choline uptake) and GABAergic parameters [benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors] were studied in the frontal and piriform cortex, dorsal hippocampus, amygdaloid complex, and nucleus basalis. Kainic acid treatment resulted in a significant reduction of choline acetyltransferase activity in the piriform cortex (by 20%), amygdala (by 19%), and nucleus basalis (by 31%) in comparison with vehicle-injected control rats. A lower activity of acetylcholinesterase was also determined in the piriform cortex following parenteral kainic acid administration. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was significantly decreased in the piriform cortex (by 33%), amygdala (by 39%), and nucleus basalis (by 33%) in the group treated with kainic acid, whereas such binding in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was not affected by kainic acid. Sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake into cholinergic nerve terminals was decreased in the piriform cortex (by 25%) and amygdala (by 24%) after kainic acid treatment. In contrast, [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors and [3H]muscimol binding to GABA receptors were not affected 3 days after parenteral kainic acid application in any of the brain regions studied. The data indicate that kainic acid-induced limbic seizures result in a loss of cholinergic cells in the nucleus basalis that is paralleled by degeneration of cholinergic fibers and cholinoceptive structures in the piriform cortex and amygdala, a finding emphasizing the important role of cholinergic mechanisms in generating and/or maintaining seizure activity.", 
    "80": "Muscarinic receptor stimulation increased the accumulation of 3H-inositol phosphates in PC12 cells whose phospholipids had been prelabeled with [3H]inositol. Muscarine also inhibited the increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation caused by 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine or by vasoactive intestinal peptide. This effect of muscarine was apparently due to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase rather than to a stimulation of a cAMP specific phosphodiesterase. The muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine inhibited both the stimulation of inositol-phospholipid metabolism and the inhibition of cAMP production with Ki values of 0.34 microM and 0.36 microM, respectively. PC12 cells contained a single class of N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) binding sites. Competition studies with muscarine (KD, 15 microM) and pirenzepine (Ki, 0.12 microM) revealed no evidence for multiple muscarinic receptors. The Ki of pirenzepine for the inhibition of [3H]NMS binding and the inhibition of muscarinic actions is consistent with the possibility that this is not an M1 receptor. Muscarine inhibited cAMP accumulation in cells made deficient in protein kinase C; therefore, this protein kinase is probably not involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of muscarine. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate also inhibited cAMP accumulation in PC12 cells but the mechanism of this effect differed from that of muscarine. Bradykinin caused a large increase in the accumulation of 3H-inositol phosphates and [3H]diacylglycerol relative to muscarine but did not inhibit cAMP production. Oxotremorine inhibited cAMP accumulation but it did not stimulate inositol-phospholipid metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
