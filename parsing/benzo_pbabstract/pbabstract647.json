    "0": "The benzodiazepines continue to offer many challenging questions for the pharmacologist. For example, do the various different properties exhibited by benzodiazepines, notably the sedative, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects, reflect aspects of a single common mechanism of action, or are these properties dissociable? To what extent to chemically unrelated drugs with similar CNS actions, such as the barbiturates, share a common mechanism of action with the benzodiazepines? The development of biochemical techniques for identifying and characterizing CNS benzodiazepine receptors by radioligand binding in vitro and in vivo has been an important recent advance, although the benzodiazepine receptor remains in many ways an enigma. The hypothesis that the anticonvulsant actions of these drugs may be due to their ability to enhance the actions of GABA at CNS synapses is an attractive one, but many questions remain: Do all CNS benzodiazepine receptors interact with GABA sites, and are all GABA receptors linked to benzodiazepine sites? What is the endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine receptors? Can the anxiolytic and sedative effects of the benzodiazepines be explained by their interaction with GABA mechanisms, or are other interactions more important? Is there more than one sub-type of benzodiazepine receptor in brain? Although these questions cannot be unequivocally answered, the benzodiazepines currently represent one of the most active and exciting areas for basic psychopharmacological research.", 
    "1": "Various anxiety states and states of panic are the classical indications for the use of benzodiazepines in hospital treatment. The clinician must distinguish the cases where a depressive or schizophrenic symptom formation underlies the panic or anxiety; in such cases antidepressants and neuroleptics yield the best results. Delirium tremens is still a serious illness. In order to calm down the patients sufficiently, appropriate sedative medication is necessary, along with other forms of general treatment. Though adequate alternatives have also been recommended, benzodiazepine therapy must at present be considered one of the most efficient and best forms of drug therapy in delirium tremens. It must be stressed that the dosage should be prescribed individually. When long-acting benzodiazepines are used, the dosage should be reduced daily by 25% of the initial dose. Benzodiazepine derivatives may be used as hypnotics in cases where the patient's ability to sleep is considered important for his treatment. Short-acting preparations of the benzodiazepine group can usually be recommended, unless particular reasons indicate the use of long-acting ones. The possibilities and limitations of combining benzodiazepines with neuroleptics and antidepressants in the treatment of schizophrenic and depressive patients are also discussed.", 
    "2": "The benzodiazepines, discovered and developed during the past 20 years, have become one of the most widely used group of drugs in the world at the present, some have suggested too widely used. The extent of therapeutic use is examined relative to the incidence of disorders associated with anxiety and it is concluded that, in general, the benzodiazepines are used conservatively by doctors rather than overused, and that their current consumption is not excessive relative to the level of emotional morbidity in the community. However, as with all psychoactive substances, dependence, both psychological and physical, can occur. This is of the alcohol-barbiturate type, though of less severity. The incidence of dependence under both therapeutic and abuse circumstance is quantified and found to be very low. The social significance of this level of dependence is examined relative to both the overall reliance of society on pleasure-giving activities, and the puritan ethics still applicable to mental illnesses. Conclusions are drawn about appropriate action that might be taken to reduce dependence.", 
    "3": "The extent of benzodiazepine use in the western world is discussed. The expanding use of these drugs appears to correlate with the development of an increasing number of benzodiazepine derivatives. A description of the various categories of anxiety is followed by a discussion of the common signs and symptoms of the anxiety states. After a discussion of the differential diagnosis of the anxiety states, a review of the indications for benzodiazepines is given. Pharmacokinetic factors in the clinical choice of specific benzodiazepines are reviewed. The use of benzodiazepines in other conditions such as alcohol abstinence syndrome, acute toxic delirium, and insomnia is considered. A review of common side effects and treatment complications is offered.", 
    "4": "Hypnotic drugs are the most frequent medical intervention for providing symptomatic relief of insomnia. Both effective amelioration of the insomnia complaint and the minimization of residual effects upon daytime performance must be considered in the selection of these medications. Data are presented here which compare the effects of short- and long-acting benzodiazepines upon sleep and upon waking performance. Unlike short-acting hypnotics with half-lives of up to 10 h (lorazepam, triazolam and temazepam), long-acting hypnotics with half-lives of up to 100 h (flurazepam, ketazolam) produce suppression of both REM and Stage 3--4 sleep which persists during the drug withdrawal (recovery) period. The half-life of hypnotics is also directly related to the duration of residual effects upon daytime performance. Hypnotics with long half-lives (flurazepam) produce more prolonged performance decrements than hypnotics with short half-lives (temazepam). In insomniacs, both effects upon sleep and upon walking performance must be considered in the selection of a hypnotic.", 
    "5": "Because benzodiazepine derivatives are biotransformed by a variety of metabolic pathways, it is not surprising that age has varying effects on their kinetic properties. Both chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are biotransformed by hepatic N-demethylation. The aging process is associated with prolonged half-life and reduced clearance of both of these drugs. Sex may also influence their kinetics. In the case of diazepam, aging effects may be masked by alterations in protein binding. Desmethyldiazepam and desalkylflurazepam are biotransformed by hydroxylation. Old age tends to be associated with reduced clearance of these two compounds, particularly among elderly males, but age explains a relatively small portion of individual variation in their kinetics. Oxazepam, lorazepam, and temazepam undergo glucuronidation. Age has a relatively minor effect on the kinetics of these compounds. In general, altered hepatic clearance in the elderly does not necessarily predict changes in drug sensitivity, since many factors complicate the relation between blood concentrations and clinical response. Drug interactions with benzodiazepine derivatives are relatively uncommon and generally are not of clinical significance. Antacid coadministration reduces the rate but not the completeness of benzodiazepine absorption. Concurrent therapy with disulfiram impairs the clearance of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, but not of oxazepam or lorazepam. Kinetic interactions with alcohol have been inconsistently reported, but probably are less important than the predictable additive central depressant effects.", 
    "6": "The disposition of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam and lorazepam was studied before and after disulfiram administration to normal subjects and alcoholic patients. Similar studies to determine the effect of ethanol administration on diazepam and oxazepam disposition were also performed. After disulfiram, decreases in the plasma clearance of chlordiazepoxide (54%, p < 0.05; diazepam, 41% p < 0.05) and their active metabolites were observed. Oxazepam and lorazepam have no important active metabolites and the effect of disulfiram on their net disposition was minimal. In normal subjects ethanol (> 800 mg/l maintained for 8 h) increased the AUC free diazepam (26.6 +/- 17.3% mean +/- SD, p < 0.05) and decreased the AUC for N-desmethyldiazepam (50.5 +/- 11.7%, p < 0.05) indicating inhibition of diazepam N-desmethylation. In contrast, there was no significant change in the disposition of oxazepam in four healthy subjects after a single oral dose of ethanol. Thus, disulfiram and ethanol appear not to inhibit the metabolic disposition of oxazepam or lorazepam, benzodiazepine derivatives principally biotransformed by glucuronidation. On pharmacokinetic grounds oxazepam and lorazepam may be the drugs of choice if benzodiazepine therapy is required in chronic alcoholics.", 
    "7": "Among the various benzodiazepines large differences exist with regard to their pharmacokinetic properties and metabolism in man. Some are eliminated from the body at a relatively slow rate (e. g. diazepam), others are metabolized rather rapidly (e. g. oxazepam, temazepam, triazolam). Several benzodiazepines have the long-acting metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam in common (diazepam, fosazepam, prazepam, clorazepate). Such differences may be very important clinically because pharmacokinetic factors will determine the duration of drug effect and pharmacokinetic parameters constitute the basis for a rational dosage regimen. For the various clinical indications of benzodiazepines the required duration of drug action differs quite fundamentally. In anticonvulsant and anti-anxiety treatment continuous treatment is pursued, so that compounds with long elimination half-lives of parent drug or active metabolites are of advantage. If on the other hand a benzodiazepine is taken as a hypnotic, the duration of action should be restricted to the night, hence a compound with a short elimination half-life is to be preferred. A review is given of the pharmacokinetics of the major benzodiazepines presently available.", 
    "8": "The therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines in psychoneurosis may depend in part on their ability to disinhibit a patient's anxiety-suppressed, gratification-seeking behavior. Benzodiazepines may disinhibit behavior by reducing the activity of serotonin (and possibly acetylcholine) neurons in the brain's \"punishment\" system. Reduction of serotonin transmission may be due to a facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)-mediated presynaptic inhibition at the serotonin nerve terminal.", 
    "9": "If rats trained to press a lever for food, then receive a shock to the feet following every response, their behavioural output is severely depressed. This procedure is termed immediately punishment and it was used by Geller and Seifter in the task devised to demonstrate the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines. These drugs and a number of others with anxiolytic activity (e. g. barbiturates, ethanol) reverse the suppression induced by the presentation of a highly aversive stimulus, like electric shock. The Geller-Seifter procedure has figured prominently in behavioural studies of benzodiazepines and in the efforts to determine the neuropharmacological basis of their anxiolytic action. Experiments involving the manipulation of brain noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels with drugs or lesions are discussed. The Geller-Seifter procedure is, however, a time consuming and difficult behavioural baseline to work with. It is important, therefore, to devise equally specific but simpler animal models of anxiety. Electric shock, as the anxiety-inducing event has dominated the tasks devised by behavioural psychologists. It is essential to search for more biologically relevant events with which to control the level of anxiety in experimental animals. Tests involving the manipulation of novelty and uncertainty will be presented and their responsiveness to anxiolytic drugs and neuropharmacological manipulation discussed. Recent advances in defining the biochemical and pharmacological properties of benzodiazepine receptors and particularly of their differential distribution in brain, makes it likely that simple reliable animal tests of anxiety would serve neuropharmacology well and be of great value in understanding the functional importance of the benzodiazepine receptors of brain.", 
    "10": "Benzodiazepines have been shown to change the turnover rate of 5-HT, ACh and catecholamines stored in selected brain areas, but the doses required for these effects are several-fold higher than those which elicit a persistent punished behavior or antagonize isoniazid, bicuculline or picrotoxin convulsion. The selective antagonism against convulsions elicited by drugs that impair GABAergic transmission, the capability of muscimol and other GABA receptors agonists to mimic behavioral and anticonvulsant action of the benzodiazepines have suggested that benzodiazepines facilitate GABA transmission. This facilitation of the GABA tranmission is due to an allosteric facilitation of high-affinity GABA binding to postsynaptic receptors. Also, the high-affinity binding of the benzodiazepines can be facilitated by GABA mimetics. Endogenous inhibitors of the benzodiazepines and GABA binding extracted from synaptic membranes play a role in facilitating these interactions. Using neuroblastoma 2A cells as a model and Cl- influx as an index of GABA receptor activation, it will be shown that the benzodiazepines facilitates not only GABA binding but also its action on Cl- channels. Also, glioma C6 cells have high affinity receptors for GABA and benzodiazepine binding but these binding sites are not linked to a Cl- channel. It is concluded that the benzodiazepines displace a regulatory protein for high-affinity GABA receptors and thereby facilitate GABAergic transmission.", 
    "11": "It appeared recently that the important group of psychoactive drugs, the benzodiazepines, binds with high affinity to a single class of saturable sites on brain membranes of all higher vertebrates including man. There was a good correlation between the pharmacological effects of different benzodiazepines and their affinity for 3H-diazepam and 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites, indicating that the binding site is the physiological relevant receptor upon which benzodiazepines act. The most active benzodiazepines, like lorazepam and triazolam, act in concentrations of about 1 nmol/l. The highest concentration of benzodiazepine receptors in human brain was found in cerebral cortical regions, intermediate levels were found in midbrain and some limbic structures, while white matter areas exhibit low levels. This indicates that benzodiazepines act preferentially in cortical areas. The presence of benzodiazepine receptors suggests that there may an endogenous ligand for these receptors. Hypoxanthine, inosine and nicotinamide have been isolated from brain tissue and proposed as endogenous ligands. These three compounds are very weak on benzodiazepine receptors. The most promising compound has been isolated from human urine and brain and is a lipophilic, small-molecular weight aromatic compound, which exhibits very high affinity (Ki congruent to 0.003 mumol/l) for benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "12": "Fenazepam, a potent anxiolytic tranquillizer (7-brom-5/o-chlorphenyl/1,2-dihydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-on) was used in the treatment of 173 psychotic patients ( schizophrenia, endogenous depressions, involutional and organic psychoses). In all cases the clinical picture was characterized by anxiety. In 37% of the patients the psychopathological symptomatology disappeared altogether, in 27% there was a significant improvement. The best results were attained in the treatment of anxious-depressive, depersonalization and affective-delusional states. Anxious-depressive conditions in endogenous depressions gave worse results during fenazepam treatment, than in schizophrenia and organic brain disorders. Affective-delusional attacks were arrested by fenazepam in the initial phases. A good effect was also seen in depersonalization.", 
    "13": "A post-marketing surveillance study of Euhypnos (temazepam), a new short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic. A total of 12,350 patients requiring a sleep inducer were treated for up to 3 months with doses of 10-30 mg at night. After 2 weeks 80% of First Reports (FRs) rated Euhypnos effective and at 3 months this had risen to 92% of 3062 Second Reports (SRs). Hangover was reported in 7% of FRs and 2% of SRs but in general the drug was well tolerated with adverse reactions consisting mainly of morning nausea, headache, drowsiness and vivid dreaming. Eighty-seven per cent of FRs and 93% of SRs were 'Clean' reporting no hangover, adverse reaction or event of any kind.", 
    "14": "A 28-day, double-blind study involving 56 outpatients ws initiated to compare the anxiolytic efficacy and safety of ketazolam once a day at bedtime (HS) with diazepam given three times a day (TID) and placebo HS or TID. Ketazolam HS was at least equivalent, and in some respects superior, to diazepam TID with fewer, less severe side effects. The superiority of ketazolam over placebo was demonstrated on all five instruments used to evaluate efficacy, three rated by the physician and two by the patient. The efficacy of ketazolam was significant at all three follow-up evaluations, whereas significant results for diazepam were achieved mainly at weeks 1 and 2, with little seen at week f. Fewer side effects were reported with ketazolam than with diazepam and were mild in 84% of cases. One-third of the side effects reportd in the diazepam group were moderate or severe. The optimum daily dose was 54.5 mg ketazolam or 24.7 mg diazepam.", 
    "15": "An investigation in 50 patients has shown that biochemical measurements of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), ACTH and cortisol as well as the concentration of glucose and insulin signal a reduction of surgical stress under the medication of the tranquilizer 10-chloro-11b-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,3,5,6,7,11b-hexahydrobenzo[6,7]-1,4-diazepino[5,4-b]oxazol-6-one (cloxazolam, MT 14-411). There was an inhibition of the DBH-increase during the surgical procedure and an inhibition of the ACTH- and cortisol-secretion before and during surgery as well as a reduction of the insulin antagonizing effect during sympathicoadrenal stimulation. With the exception of a sedative action no other side effects have been observed.", 
    "16": "The effect of thiopentone, etomidate and flunitrazepam on cerebral energy metabolism was investigated in the male Wistar rat. Brain cortex was deep-frozen in situ under steady state conditions (normotension, normothermia, normoxia and normocapnia) of a standardized anaesthesia. Anaesthesia with thiopentone led to an decrease in glycolytic flux on the level of the hexokinase and/or phosphofructokinase reaction as well as reduced citric acid cycle intermediates. The brain cortex levels of high-energy phosphates however are unchanged thus indicating an adequate supply of energy for the brain. Similar results were obtained when anaesthesia was induced with etomidate and flunitrazepam. In spite of the fact that flunitrazepam seemed not to influence the phosphofructokinase reaction an equivalent hypnotic dose of each drug led to comparable metabolic effects in the brain cortex.", 
    "17": "Fifty healthy female patients scheduled for surgery were randonly allocated into two groups in a double-blind study. One group received lorazepam 2.5 mg orally at 2200 h on the evening before surgery as night sedation, and again at 0800 h on the morning before surgery as premedication. The second group received diazepam 10 mg orally at the samte times. The quality of sleep the night before surgery was superior in the lorazepam group (p less than 0.02). The frequency of effective sedation produced pre-operatively was similar in both groups. Although the incidence of amnesia for visual stimuli following lorazapam was higher (p less than 0.05) than with diazepam, there was no difference in the recall of auditory and painful stimuli. The overall incidence of side effects was similar for each drug and at the dosage used no difference was found in the time to awaken from anaesthesia.", 
    "18": "The residual effects of three hypnotics were investigated by the method of 24-h polygraphy (EEG, EMG, and EOG). The drugs were triazolam 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg, flurazepam 15 mg and 30 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg and 10 mg, and placebo. The subjects were healthy volunteers, eight men and eight women with an average age of 34.3 years. The number of total polygraphic records was 77. Triazolam 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg, flurazepam 30 mg, and nitrazepam 10 mg showed definited sleep inducing and sleep maintenance effects in night recordings. Flurazepam 15 mg and 30 mg and nitrazepam 5 mg and 10 mg were followed by residual effects in morning, afternoon and evening recording periods on the day after the administrations of the hypnotics. However, no effects were seen on the day after the administration of triazolam 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg except for some slight residual effects in the morning. Thus triazolam 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg produces less residual effect than do flurazepam 15 mg and 30 mg, and nitrazepam 5 mg and 10 mg, and 24-h polygraphy is useful for measuring the residual effects of hypnotics.", 
    "19": "In squirrel monkeys that had undergone repeated treatment with haloperidol at intervals of 7--14 days, subsequent acute administration of haloperidol induced dystonia and dyskinesias. This acute effect of haloperidol was dose-related and occurred at the same doses that impaired Sidman avoidance performance. Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, metoclopramide, tetrabenazine, and Su-23397, all of which have been associated with extrapyramidal side effects, reliably elicited dyskinesias in these monkeys. Dyskinesias were less mared after thioridazine and absent after clozapine, corresponding to the reported lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects in the clinic. The non-neuroleptics, baclofen, and diazepam, failed to elicit dyskinesias. In contrast to the dyskinetic syndrome, the incidence of catalepsy or tremor did not accurately predict propensity to elicit extrapyramidal symptomatology. The acute dyskinetic syndrome in squirrel monkeys may therefore serve as an animal model for predicting the ability of antipsychotics to cause extrapyramidal dysfunction, and may yield insight into the mechanisms of these drug-induced motor disorders.", 
    "20": "A considerable amount of evidence indicates that the brain tryptophan level depends on circulating tryptophan. Changes of tryptophan concentration have also been described to modify the activity of benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. In the present study, a series of psychoactive drugs have been preliminarily screened for their activity on brain and plasma tryptophan levels. The results obtained suggest that tryptophan may be involved to varying extents in the activity of different psychoactive compounds.", 
    "21": "The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of triazolam 0.5 mg on the sleep of insomniac patients when given for 3 weeks. The results showed that both acute and chronic triazolam administration are effective in decreasing sleep latency, increasing sleep duration, increasing sleep efficiency and decreasing total wake time without producing major effects on sleep staging. Sleep Stages 1 and 2 were significantly altered by drug treatment but in a positive direction. This change is primarily attributable to the significant decrease in sleep onset. Deep sleep and REM were not significantly changed during triazolam treatment nor was there any evidence of REM rebound after discontinuation of the medication. It was noted that some of the sleep parameters measured shifted toward baseline measures in the first night after triazolam treatment was terminated. However, the total recovery period recorded (7 days) showed the quality and quantity of sleep obtained to be improved over baseline measures. The recovery data compared favourably with those improvements noted during chronic administration of triazolam. It was also found that 3 weeks of triazolam 0.5 mg usage did not result in tolerance to its hypnotic properties. Thus, triazolam maintains its hypnotic effectiveness throughout 3 weeks of administration.", 
    "22": "In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study the CNS efficacy and pharmacodynamic properties of 3-hydroxy-5-(o-chlorophenyl)-7-chloro-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrido[3,2-e]-1,4-diazepin-2-one (lopirazepam, D-12524) was investigated in a group of 10 normal volunteers. Quantitative EEG and psychometric analyses and clinical evaluations were done before as well as 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after oral administration of single doses of placebo, 3 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg lopirazepam and 10 mg prazepam. EEG digital computer period analysis demonstrated dose-dependent changes which are typical of the class of anxiolytics and which started in the 2nd hour, peaked in the 4th hour and lasted after 3 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg up to the 4th, 6th and 8th hour, respectively, 10 mg D-12524 produced an additional augmentation of slow waves indicating sleep-inducing qualities in this dosage. The equipotent dosage to 10 mg prazepam seems to be 5 mg. Psychometric analyses demonstrated an improvement in attention, psychomotor performance, mood and affectivity after 3 mg, opposite changes after 10 mg D-12524. Flickerlight fusion, reaction time, after-image and EAS score were determined as well. Data concerning side effects, pulse rate and blood pressure suggested a good tolerance of the drug.", 
    "23": "After intensive psychophysical sports exercise phenazepam given to 18 male athletes at a dose of 0.0005 g reduced the latent period of ordinary motor reactions to the sound and improved visual-motor coordination as judged from the test of reacting to the moving object, and also slightly increased the critical frequency of light flickering confluence and time of digital recognition. At a dose of 0.002 g phenazepam led to contrary changes in the parameters cited. No residual action was recorded in the morning after phenazepam administration overnight as a hypnotic agent at a dose of 0.002 g.", 
    "24": "The anxiolytic effects of alpraxolam (0.5--3.0 mg), diazepam (5--60 mg) and placebo were evaluated in eighty-six out-patients suffering from moderate to severe psychoneurotic anxiety in this 28-day, double-blind study. Efficacy was evaluated using five rating instruments, three rated by the physician (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Physician's Global Impressions and Target Symptoms) and two by the patients (Self-Rating Symptom Scale and Patient's Global Impressions). Alprazolam was more effective than placebo on all five measures of efficacy and, on several parameters, more effective than diazepam as well. The incidence of side-effects was lowest in the alprazolam group and decreased steadily over the course of the study, whereas the incidence in the diazepam and placebo groups remained relatively unchanged.", 
    "25": "Evidence is reviewed for considering an ego-impairment/psychopathologic basis for understanding alcoholism. Despite conflicting reports, there is also evidence that psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatment may be effective. The author describes his management and treatment of alcohol problems based on an appreciation of the alcoholic's ego impairments and other psychopathology.", 
    "26": "Eight patients were given flunitrazepam 2 mg orally, once daily for 28 consecutive days. The time-course of the plasma concentration of unchanged flunitrazepam and its principal metabolites were studied in detail after the first and last doses. Additional blood samples were collected immediately before administration of the tablet on days 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21 and 25. Clinically there were not changes during the trial period in the onset of sleep, duration of sleep, depth of sleep measured as number of spontaneous awakenings, or in the patients' condition on awakening. The time-course of the plasma concentration of flunitrazepam could be described by a three-compartment model, assuming that the rate constants remained unchanged during treatment. Maximal plasma concentrations of unchanged flunitrazepam, found two hours after intake, reached 10-15 ng/ml after the first and 15-20 ng/ml after the last dose. The beta-half-life was found to be between 20 and 36 h.", 
    "27": "The utilisation of hypnotics, sedatives, and minor tranquillisers (HSmT) was studied by means of drug-delivery and hospital occupancy statistics for 1975-1977 in a Swedish university hospital. A total of 0.53 so-called defined daily doses (DDD)/bed-day were delivered in 1975, implying that every second patient might have regularly been prescribed HSmT. The benzodiazepines were predominant with 71% of the deliveries. Five major drugs accounted for 88%. The drug pattern and the range of DDD/day-bed (0.09-1.18) differed considerably between the departments. Drugs not recommended by the hospital's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committe accounted only for 3% of deliveries. In a drug surveillance study performed in two medical wards, HSmT were prescribed for 43% of 274 patients. Drug delivery and prescription data were in broad agreement. Drug information activities in the hospital had a clearly discernable influence on the delivered DDD/bed-day. This measure is an inexpensive indicator of drug utilisation in a hospital and a suitable basis for therapeutic audit.", 
    "28": "A neurophysiological study of 4 benzodiazepines in the free implanted cat serves as basis to a discussion concerning tranquilizers, anxiety and vigilance. The electrophysiological and behavioural effects of diazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam and of clorazepate dipotassique are analysed and compared between them and other psychotropic drugs. Their mode of action on the behaviour, on the bioelectric cortical and hippocampal rhythms, is explained according to recent biochemical data. The relations with anxiety, vigilance and neuro-psycho-physiologic mechanisms which subtend them are discussed at the light of clinical effects provoked by substances called tranquillizers.", 
    "29": "We describe a procedure for determing clorazepate dipotassium as its decarboxylated, pharmacologically active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, in 100 microL of plasma, with use of electron-capture gas--liquid chromatography and with methylnitrazepam as the internal standard. The procedure is a one-tube, one-step extraction without derivative formation and is accurate, reproducible, and rapid. The sensitivity limit is 20 micrograms/L. Within-run and between-run CV's (concentration, 3.5 mg/L) were 2.9 and 3.5%, respectively. Within-run CV's for 1.5 and 1.0 mg/L concentrations were 3.9 and 4.3%, respectively. For a 1.0 mg/kg per day dose of clorazepate dipotassium, the mean steady-state concentration of desmethyldiazepam in plasma was 1.037 mg/L.", 
    "30": "Three groups of patients with different premedications were examined for changes of blood pressure, heart rate, ECG and plasma free fatty acid levels during esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy: Group A was premedicated with Bunitrolol, group B was premedicated with Hyoscin-N-butyl-bromide and diazepam, group C was endoscopied without premedication. The pulse rate rose significantly less in group A than in groups A and C; the same phenomenon was observed with regard to the systolic blood pressure. Premature beats occurred in all 3 groups: 32 per cent of the patients in group A, 43 per cent in group B and 60 per cent in group C had at least occasional premature beats; an accumulation of premature beats however occurred significantly less frequently in group A than in groups B or C. A drop of the ST-part of the ECG occurred with about the same frequency in each group. An increase of the plasma free fatty acids, which was noted in groups B and C, could be observed in Group A. A pre-endoscopic medication of beta blocking agents could be a useful measure in patients with labile arterial hypertension, vegatative dysregulation and a hyperkinetic heart syndrome.", 
    "31": "A simple, rapid and sensitive gas chromatographic procedure using the photoionization detector (PID) was developed for the detection and quantitation of several drugs in serum and urine. In order to evaluate the performance of the PID, the results were compared with those of the flame-ionization detector (FID). The data indicate that the PID is 8-16 times more sensitive than the FID for the drugs studied in the barbiturate group. Excellent reproducibility was found for samples quantitated with the PID on a routine basis. The PID and FID produced statistically similar results on extracted serum samples. The correlation coefficient was 0.99. The PID also produced chromatograms with less background than those obtained with the FID for many extracted serum samples. The advantages of the PID for drug analysis in biological fluids include simplicity of operation, lack of solvent response, universal drug response, non-destructive character and stability.", 
    "32": "The existence of specific receptor sites for benzodiazepines has been well documented by in vitro binding studies. In this study, using a highly radiolabelled [3H]-flunitrazepam, we investigated the binding of benzodiazepines to their receptor sites under in vivo conditions. Tracer doses of [3H]flunitrazepam (0.001 mg/kg) were injected i.v. into mice and the concentration of the drug in the brain was monitored. The accumulation of [3H]flunitrazepam 20 min after injection was found to be highest in the hippocampus, cortex, hypothalamus; to be intermediate in the striatum, medulla oblongata/pons and midbrain and to be lowest in the cerebellum. This corresponds well with the different densities of benzodiazepine receptors which we found in in vitro studies, with the exception of medulla oblongata/pons and cerebellum. When increasing doses (0.01--10 mg/kg) of non-labelled benzodiazepine derivatives (flunitrazepam, clonazepam, the 3S and 3R enantiomers of 5-(o-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihyrdo-1,3-dimethyl-7-nitro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one, and chlordiazepoxide) were injected simultaneously with [3H]flunitrazepam, a dose-dependant, saturable and and stereo-specific decrease of [3H]flunitrazepam concentration in the mouse hippocampus was observed. The dose range in which the unlabelled benzodiazepines decreases the levels of [3H]flunitrazepam in the hippocampus corresponds closely to that which inhibited pentylenetetrazol- or picrotoxin-induced seizures, indicating that this in vivo method determines the occupation of pharmacologically relevant receptors.", 
    "33": "The origin of the psychiatric illnesses observed in drug abusers is often unclear. This study examines the causal relation between drug abuse and specific psychiatric disorders. Fifty-one male veterans first seen in 1972, who were admitted at least once per year for six consecutive years for inpatient drug-abuse treatment, underwent psychiatric assessments at each admission. Eleven men mainly used stimulants, 14 depressants, and 26 opiates. Initial psychiatric examinations showed low symptom levels in all groups but no statistically significant differences among them. By the end of six years, five of the stimulant users had psychoses, and eight of the depressant users had serious depression. The narcotics users showed no change in psychopathology. Differences between the groups were significant at the 0.01 level. These changes were not due to acute toxic reactions, but our data suggest that abuse of particular drugs has a major role in the development of specific psychiatric illnesses. The possibility that different preexisting personality disorders lead to different kinds of drug abuse cannot be excluded.", 
    "34": "The interaction of two benzodiazepine compounds, flurazepam (a sedative and RO 5-3663 (a convulsant), with amino acid depressions of spontaneous neuronal activity in hypothalamic tissue cultures has been examined. Flurazepam selectively potentiated, GABA-induced inhibition, while RO 5-3663 selectively reduced GABA-induced inhibtion. These results are interpreted as supporting the presence of two types of benzodiazepine binding sites in the brain which would modulate endogenous GABA-mediated inhibition and behavior.", 
    "35": "In healthy volunteers pretreated with atropine (0.5 mg), ketamine given as a bolus i.v. injection (2 mg/kg) followed by an infusion of ketamine (1 mg/kg/hr) for one hour, caused a significant rise in blood pressure and heart rate. This cardiovascular stimulation was rapidly counteracted by diazepam (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) given when the response to ketamine was already maximal.", 
    "36": "After oral application of the weakly basic (pKs = 6.18-6.26) and relatively stable (1 at pH = 7.4; t1/2(35 degrees C) = 6.9 h) secondary 1-diazocarbonylhydrocotarnine or -hydrohydrastinine derivatives 1-4 and of hydrocotarnine (6) to rats, a total of 18 metabolites, predominantly isoquinolines of varying degrees of hydrogenation (7-19), were isolated from 48-hour urine specimens. These isoquinolines result from cleavage of the C-1/C-1' bond as well as from oxygenation (11, 15, 17-19), N-dealkylation (13, 15, 17-19) and O-dealkylation (8-12, 18, 19). Among these isoquinolines were some phenolic betaines (8-11) of which 9 is the major metabolite of the cotarnine derivatives. Furthermore, C-1-substituted metabolites as well as metabolites with benzo-1,2-diazaindolizine (23, 24) or benzodiazepine structure (20, 21) were isolated. Also in an aqueous-alkaline or an aqueous-acidic medium, the cleavage of the C-1/C-1' bond as well as the formation of benzodiazepines follows a non-enzymatic pathway as evidenced by stability studies. The structures assigned to the different compounds are supported by high-resolved mass spectra, further spectroscopic studies (UV, IR and 1H-NMR spectra) and, in part, by comparison with authentical material.",

    "38": "Pharmacokinetics of a series of prodrug-type oxazepam esters were studied in mice. The effect of hydrophobicity was investigated in relation to serum binding, brain penetration, tissue storage, and excretion. Binding to mouse serum and to human serum albumin was measured by equilibrium dialysis, and the changes in binding free energy were correlated with RM values. Brain-blood partition of the esters did not change parallel with their serum binding. An indirect correlation exists between RM of the esters and oxazepam brain accrual. Brain-blood concentration ratios of oxazepam prove that hydrolysis precedes brain penetration and hydrophobicity might primarily influence the hydrolysis rate. The amount of tissue storage and total excretion rates also correlate with hydrophobicity.", 
    "39": "Esters of the centrally acting oxazepam were investigated to find quantitative correlations between the pharmacokinetics of the parent drug and in vitro biotransformation rates and physicochemical properties of its prodrugs. The 14C-labeled aliphatic and omega-phenyl-substituted esters were administered intravenously to mice. Brain levels of the esters and oxazepam were determined and the latter was fitted to a simplified exponential equation. In vitro hydrolysis rate of the esters catalyzed by the hepatic microsomal fraction was measured with a pH stat. Pharmacokinetic constants characterizing the rising part of oxazepam brain levels correlate well with the chromatographic RM values and with in vitro maximal hydrolysis rates of the esters. The hydrolysis is capacity limited in the liver. In a closely related set of aliphatic esters, oxazepam brain penetration also correlates with the steric constant (ES) of its esters.", 
    "40": "Experimental vasogenic cerebral edema was created in rabbits with a cold-induced left occipital cortical lesions. Intracranial pressure (ICP), intracranial elastance (Em), water content, hemispheric brain tissue volume, electrolytes, electroencephalograms, behavior, and gross pathology were studied. Various therapeutic modalities were employed alone or in combination to reduce ICP acutely: acetazolamide, furosemide, mannitol, pentobarbital, lorazepam, and dexamethasone. All therapies except dexamethasone were effective in reducing ICP. Peak ICP reduction occurred at 27 +/- 9.8 (SD) minutes with mannitol and at 71.4 +/- 15.5 minutes with acetazolamide, with the remaining agents and combinations falling between these two extreme values. Em improved by 31.7 +/- 17.02% in all therapuetic trials except those employing acetazolamide and lorazepam. With therapy, there was a reduction in the water content of the hemispheres, but the difference from that in the untreated, lesioned animals was not statistically significant. In the lesioned left hemisphere, sodium content was increased by acetazolamide (p less than 0.005), furosemide (p less than 0.025), pentobarbital (p less than 0.05), and the combination of dexamethasone, pentobarbital, and mannitol (p less than 0.005). Significant reduction was noted in the lesioned group for the potassium content of the left hemisphere in the dexamethasone (p less than 0.05), pentobarbital (p less than 0.025), and combination groups containing these agents (p less than 0.005 to 0.025). (Neurosurgery, 5: 656--665, 1979).", 
    "41": "[3H]Diazepam binding was measured in rat cortical membranes. Acute and chronic amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA) pretreatment greatly increased GABA levels, but did not alter diazepam binding. The GABA normally present was sufficient to maximally stimulate diazepam binding. In in vivo binding studies, acute and chronic AOAA treatment increased the amount of [3H]diazepam in the brain at the time of sacrifice, thus increasing both specific and nonspecific binding and leaving unchanged the fraction of drug specifically bound. Fluctuation of brain GABA may not affect benzodiazepine binding unless the normal concentration is greatly depressed.", 
    "42": "1. The i.v. administration of convulsant doses of penetrazole or picrotoxin induced an increase in PGF2 alpha, PGE2 and TXB2-like immunoreactive material in mouse brain tissue. The onset of increase coincided with the appearance of clonic seizures. 2. The anticonvulsant drugs trimethadione and diazepam reduced both convulsions and increase of the above arachidonic acid metabolites induced by pentetrazole or picrotoxin. 3. In synaptosomal preparations of the brain, neither pentetrazole (10(-3) mol 1(-1) picrotoxin (10(-4) mol 1(-1) nor trimethadione (5 x 10(-4) mol 1(-1)) had any influence on cyclooxygenase activity as indicated by the unimpaired PGF2 alpha-synthesis. 4. Under hypoxic conditions at equal durations as the seizures, the formation of PGF2 alpha and PGE2 was less than 10% of the amount occurring after penetrazole-induced convulsions. 5. It is concluded that the seizure-induced rise of PGF2 alpha, PGE2 and TXB2 is the result of increased central nervous activity.", 
    "43": "The cremophor-containing anaesthetic agents, Althesin, propanidid and diazepam, were added to plasma in vitro and administered to patients. In vitro these anaesthetics, and cremophor alone in concentrations equal to those obtained in vivo, decreased the viscosity of plasma 45% at shear rate 11.5 s-1. In 11 patients given cremophor-containing anaesthetics to induce anaesthesia, plasma samples obtained 5 min after injection showed a mean decrease in viscosity of 42% compared with the pre-induction values. The effect on viscosity after a single dose disappeared in 50 min. Triton x-100 added to plasma caused a decrease in viscosity similar to that of cremophor. The interaction in vitro of cremophor and Triton x-100 with concentrated urea was found to be identical both in plasma and dextran. This suggests that cremophor acts by increasing the sheet of structured water around the protein molecules, thereby preventing the aggregation of proteins.", 
    "44": "The effect of premedication upon the induction of anaesthesia with etomidate was studied in 74 adult patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. Premedication with fentanyl plus atropine or with diazepam plus atropine decreased the frequency of involuntary muscle movements without modifying the pattern of the circulatory effects of etomidate, although fentanyl increased the frequency of apnoea. Pain at the site of injection was not modified by premedication.", 
    "45": "In 104 premedicated patients undergoing general surgery, anaesthesia was induced either with etomidate 0.3 mg kg-1 preceded by fentanyl 1.25 or 2.5 microgram kg-1 i.v.or diazepam 0.0625 or 0.125 mg kg-1 i.v., or with thiopentone preceded by fentanyl 1.25 microgram kg-1 i.v. Despite the use of fentanyl or diazepam, the frequency of pain on injection in patients receiving etomidate was between 32% and 53%, being rated as severe in 5-20% of patients. No pain was experienced by patients receiving thiopentone. The frequency of involuntary movement was 15-35% with etomidate and 15% with thiopentone. The frequency of both pain and involuntary muscle movements was least when fentanyl 2.5 microgram kg-1 preceded the administration of etomidate. There was no significant relationship between the pain and muscle movement; three of 10 patients given etomidate into a central vein had such movements.", 
    "46": "Cell-cycle kinetics, sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosome aberrations have been studied from the skin fibroblasts of the Indian muntjac after treatment with 100 micrograms/ml of caffeine and 0.05 microgram/ml of anthramycin. The cultures were incubated for a period which was sufficient for the completion of two consecutive cell cycles and both the drugs appeared to produce a slight inhibitory effect. When anthramycin-treated cells were however post-treated with caffeine, the cells did not proceed beyond one cycle and exhibited a mitotic block. The SCE frequency in the control and the experiments with caffeine and anthramycin was 8.63, 18.32 and 34.88 per cell respectively. The SCEs were randomly distributed amongst all chromosomes unlike a non-random distribution within the X chromosomes. Caffeine and anthramycin produced only 0.5% and 3.1 cells with chromosome aberrations respectively. Potentiation of chromosome aberrations was observed when the anthramycin-treated cells were post-treated with caffeine. Caffeine potentiation presumably results from an inhibition of the cells to cycle and a failure to repair the effect of the mutagen on DNA.", 
    "47": "Chlorpromazine and fluphenazine decanoate were employed to treat aggressive behavior and emesis in a 22-year-old patient with Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Institution of the above neuroleptics, following an unsuccessful trial of diazepam, produced reductions of 95.1 per cent and 37.9 per cent for aggressive behavior and emesis, respectively. Four follow-up observations, occurring at 3-week intervals, revealed maintenance of low rates of aggressive behavior and continued reductions in emesis (mean reduction of 81.5 per cent). These findings are important for their a) inclusion of direct behavioral observation as the data base, and b) initial promising effects of neuroleptics for a rare mental retardation syndrome.", 
    "48": "Plasma levels of acetaminophen (paracetamol) and diazepam were measured in 9 children by gas chromatography after administering these drugs simultaneously in separate suppositories. The antipyretic effects of oral and rectal acetaminophen-diazepam combinations were also studied and compared with that of oral or rectal acetaminophen alone. Diazepam at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg did not increase the antipyretic action of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen and diazepam seemed to be well absorbed from the rectal suppositories, the maximal plasma concentration of diazepam after a rectal dose of 0.5 mg/kg just reaching the assumed anticonvulsant level in about 2 hr. In light of this study, an acetaminophen-diazepam combination in separate suppositories may be suitable for the prevention of recurrent febrile convulsions in susceptible children, but its practical value and efficacy require evaluation in clinical experiments.", 
    "49": "Intramuscular injection of diazepam to rats at doses of 0.01 and 2 mg/kg 25-30 min after penicillin application to the rat brain cortex leads to alteration of periodic appearance of epileptic seizures (ES), to changes in the seizure pattern, and to emergence of periodic acceleration of epileptiform discharges (ED). Injection of diazepam at a dose of 2 mg/kg 20 min before penicillin application results in the reduction of ED latency in the epileptogenic focus and in a decrease in their frequency before seizures as compared to the control animals without diazepam injection. ES appear irregularly, their quantity is markedly reduced while duration is increased. Diazepam injection leads to disappearance of the rat moving reaction during ER and ES. In vivo experiments diazepam (2 mg/kg) does not influence brain cortex Na, K-ATPase of crude synaptosomes. However, diazepam leads to an increase in Na, K-ATPase activity both in the primary and dependent secondary epileptogenic foci. It is suggested that the anticonvulsant action of diazepam may be underlain by its activating effect on Na, K-ATPase of neuronal membranes in the epileptogenic focus.", 
    "50": "Under sleep-laboratory control, the efficacy of flurazepam hydrochloride (15 mg) was evaluated in 6 women (age range, 67-82 years) with objectively verified insomnia. A 15-night, single-blind, crossover procedure was followed. Sleep records obtained during 3 placebo-baseline nights, 7 consecutive flurazepam nights, and 3 placebo-withdrawal nights were evaluated by means of electroencephalographic, electro-oculographic, and electromyographic criteria. A statistically significant reduction in sleep latency and total awake time and a corresponding increase in total sleep time (P less than 0.05) were demonstrated during the active drug period. No evidence of diminishing effectiveness was observed during the 7 days of drug administration. For the rapid-eye-movement (REM) stage, a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in mean REM percent was noted during the drug period despite an increase in mean absolute REM time. No REM rebound occurred upon drug withdrawal. There were no significant changes in mean percentages for stages 3 and 4 during the drug period and the withdrawal period. Adverse reactions were rare (chiefly some daytime drowsiness in 2 subjects).", 
    "51": "Fixed drug eruption, a common finding in Lagos, was observed among patients being treated with two heavily promoted drugs: a pyrazolone analgesic and a benzodiazepine. Offending drugs should be considered in general classes rather than as individual compounds.", 
    "52": "Laparoscopy was performed on 150 patients under ketamine-HCl-diazepam anesthesia via intravenous drip infusion. No psychomotor disturbances were noted during the emergence phase. No complications occurred during the procedures, neither from the surgical nor from the anesthesiologic point of view. No alarming stimulation of the cardiovascular system was noted. The patients became responsive within a short time, but a state of strong sleepiness remained for several hours. Therefore, ketamine-HCl-diazepam anesthesia does not appear suitable for outpatient laparoscopies but is a valuable alternative to other methods of anesthesia for laparoscopy.", 
    "53": "Tetrahydroaminoacridine (T.H.A., Tacrine) 1 mg/kg, and 4-aminopyridine (Pymadin) 0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg i.v., significantly reduced the recovery time when the were administered after ketamine-diazepam anesthesia in Maccacus Rhesus monkeys. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine (50 mg), diazepam (1.2 mg) and sodium glycopyrrolate (0.02 mg) as a secretiondrying agent, as a single bolus injection. Anesthesia was continued with ketamine by constant infusion of a solution of 5 mg/ml, at a speed of 20 mg/ml, at a speed of 20 ml/hour, during 30 minutes. The 5 monkeys in the control group were allowed to recover spontaneously. The test series consisted of the same monkeys, with an adequate rest period of one or more weeks between anesthesias. Recovery was indicated by production of nystagmus, and by an awake pattern in the EEG. Clinical signs, restlessness and purposeful movements, were also used.", 
    "54": "The vestibulo-ocular reflex in the macaque was tested before and after intravenous administration of diazepam. The drug effect was marked by decrease in gain and increase in time constant of nystagmus in response to a modified B\u00e1r\u00e1ny test and by reduction in directional asymmetry of nystagmus. Because the time course of reduction in gain differed from the time course of increase in time constant, diazepam probably has more than one site of action. These results emphasize the complexity of neural processing in the vestibulo-ocular reflex arc.", 
    "55": "Since the clinical data have been equivocal in regard to the effects of clonazepam (CZP) in focal-motor seizures, an alumina gel monkey model was used to evaluate quantitatively its efficacy with respect to this seizure category. The insolubility of CZP and its short biological half-life in monkey necessitated its evaluation in the model via constant-rate intravenous administration in a solution of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG). Two groups of monkeys were given CZP in PEG (N = 6) or a PEG solution alone as a control compound (N = 5) for 6 weeks; these treatments were bordered at both ends by 3 weeks of treatment with saline only in order to establish a baseline. CZP was administered at a concentration sufficient to achieve a plasma level of 30 ng/ml in drug step I (3 weeks) and at least double that level in drug step II (3 weeks). As a solute for CZP, and when given by itself, PEG was always administered at a concentration of 35%. The results indicate that CZP is effective for focal-motor seizures and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, particularly when its concentration in plasma is higher than 60 ng/ml. Withdrawal seizures were evident on cessation of CZP administration. CZP appears to be a useful broad-spectrum anticonvulsant when managed carefully. An unexpected finding was the irreversibility of the pharmacological effect of PEG. Cessation of PEG administration significantly reduced seizure frequency in subsequent weeks to a level below the initial baseline level.", 
    "56": "In the social interaction test of anxiety Piracetam (100 mg/kg) had an anxiolytic profile very similar to that seen after 5 days of administration of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Piracetam (50-300 mg/kg) produced no signs of sedation and it was therefore suggested that it might be a non-sedative anxiolytic drug. Piracetam (100 mg/kg) produced significantly higher cortical concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine and lower concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, indicating a reduced 5-HT turnover. There were no drug-induced changes in noradrenaline or dopamine in any brain region, either with or without pretreatment with alpha-methylparatyrosine. The cortical concentrations of 7 amino acids were measured and were unchanged by treatment with Piracetam.", 
    "57": "A first report of jaundice and hepatic necrosis probably due to potassium clorazepate is described. The histology is discussed and it is suggested that the drug should not be given in the presence of suspected hepatic dysfunction.", 
    "58": "The clinical effects of oral flunitrazepam (2 mg on the night before operation followed by 2 mg on the morning of operation) and placebo as premedicants were tested in a double-blind study in 81 gynaecological patients. The separate or total concentrations of flunitrazepam and its demethylated metabolite in plasma (measured by gas chromatography) were correlated with the clinical effects of flunitrapam premedication, assessed both sugjectively and objectively. In most parameters tested (sleep on the night before operation, sedation, apprehension, headache, pulse rate), there was a positive, significant difference between the flunitrazepam group (n = 44) and the placebo group (n = 37). No significant difference was found between the two groups in emetic effect, excitement, systolic blood pressure increase, and vene-puncture, but the patients receiving flunitrazepam felt significantly more dizziness. The temperature of the left forefinger before, during and after the anaesthesia did not vary significantly between the two groups. There was no correlation between the plasma concentration of flunitrazepam and its demethylated metabolite (separate or total concentrations) and any of the parameters tested before induction of anaesthesia. Flunitrazepam is a new oral premedicant with prominent sedative and anxiolytic actions. When the drug is given as a sedative on the night before operation, followed by a second dose on the morning of operation, the beneficial effects last for at least 8 hours after the second dose.", 
    "59": "1. 7 groups of 3 healthy male volunteers each, at the age of 21--27 years received various doses of Lormetazepam (0.0635 to 4.0 mg/70 kg). -- 2. The drug was injected intravenously during 60 s. Before, during and up to 4 hours after the injections the EEG, eye-movements, ECG and respiration was recorded and blood pressures measured at given time intervals. -- 3. The vigilo-somnograms showed after the injections a change in the EEG-stages, indicating a reduction of alertness, transitions into reduced wakefulness or beginning stages of sleep. Corresponding to clinical signs one can speak with i.v. applied doses of 0.0635 to 0.5 mg/70 kg of tranquilizing, with 1 mg/70 kg of sedative and with 2--4 kg of hypnotic effects. There has been a good dosage-efficiency relation. -- 4. Side-effects or unwarranted symptoms have not been seen during the clinical observations.", 
    "60": "1 The recently discovered benzodiazepine receptor exists in high concentration in the cerebral cortex. We have, therefore, examined the effects of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide on cortical neurone responses to excitatory and inhibitory amino acids and acetylcholine, in the cortex of rats anaesthetized with urethane.2 Chlordiazepoxide applied by microiontophoresis reduced the responses to glutamate and aspartate but acetylcholine responses were unaffected on most cells even by much higher doses of benzodiazepine. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and taurine responses were unaffected on most cells, but were reduced on 4 of 25 units. After intravenous diazepam, responses to GABA and taurine were reduced on 3 cells and unchanged on 11.3 On Purkinje cells in the cerebellum a number of cells (5 of 16) exhibited a substantial increase in responses to GABA and taurine following intravenous or iontophoretic application of benzodiazepines.4 It is suggested that the highly selective reduction of excitatory amino acid responses in the cerebral cortex may be of particular relevance to the behavioural effects of benzodiazepines."
