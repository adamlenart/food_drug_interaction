Upon acquisition of the PTZ-saline discrimination, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were tested and found to antagonize the PTZ discriminative stimulus. The animals were then injected with 10 mg/kg diazepam or chlordiazepoxide for ten consecutive days. New dose-response curves obtained following this treatment indicated that tolerance did not develop to the antagonism of the PTZ discriminative stimulus by these benzodiazepines.", 
    "1": "Only about 1/4 of the statements made by the patients or accompanying persons regarding preclinical medication proved to be true. In about 66% of the cases 1--5 drugs were not stated during the first interview, while in 10% of the cases more drugs were stated than had actually been taken. Among the substances which had remained anonymous, the main shares are represented by benzodiazepines (28%), narcotic drugs (19%), neuroleptics (15%) and alcohol (15%). If one relates the number of false statements to the individual patients grouped according to diagnoses, the relatively highest quota of defaulters is found among the addicts, namely, 100%. This means that all the addicts had made false statements. The second rank is occupied by the alcoholic group who made 66% false statements, followed by the patients suffering from psychoses with 52% false statement, and the depressive patients with 47% false statements.", 
    "2": "The effect of intravenous diazepam (10 mg) or lorazepam (2 mg) on the ventilatory pattern has been studied in two groups of ten patients prior to elective surgery. Injection of lorazepam was followed by a periodic pattern of ventilation in nine patients.", 
    "3": "Twelve pretrained students ingested temazepam, nitrazepam, and placebo, each double blind at one-week intervals in randomized order. Reactive and co-ordinative skills and critical flicker fusion were measured before each drug intake and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 hours after it. Short-term memory and paired association learning were measured at 1, 3 and 8 hours. The psychomotor responses to drugs were modified by a sequence effect (not at zero tests) which effect varied depending on the drug and parameter. In multivariance analysis it was included to reveal drug effects. Nitrazepam 10 mg increased reaction and co-ordination errors and also impaired learning and memory. Temazepam 10 mg impaired co-ordinative skills; on a whole it differed from nitrazepam but hardly from placebo. Temazepam 20 mg impaired co-ordination, and learning and memory. Both temazepam 20 mg and nitrazepam were experienced sedative. All drug effects were clearest during the first 3 hours, nitrazepam also impaired learning at 8 hours. Temazepam 20 mg seems suitable as a hypnotic.", 
    "4": "Clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, was compared with placebo in 190 psychoneurotic outpatients with prominent symptoms of anxiety and tension of at least two weeks of duration. The design was one of double-blind parallel groups treated for one week. Clobazam subjects began on 40 mg daily in divided dosage, which was increased to 80 mg daily be day 3 if the drug was well tolerated. Two patients receiving clobazam had laboratory chemistry abnormalities which were possibly drug related. Adverse effects occurred more frequently in the clobazam group and were typical of those of marketed benzodiazepines. This study indicates that clobazam is an effective anxiolytic agent demonstrating its clinical effects during the first week of treatment.", 
    "5": "The effect of a single dosage of 20 mg dipotassium clorazepate (DPC) on reaction times, with and without administration of ethanol (1 g/kg body weight), was studied in 14 male subjects. When administered in the evening, the sort-term effect of DPC consisted of slightly increased optic reaction times and decreased endurance and concentration. With simultaneous administration of ethanol, all types of performance studied were significantly impaired; impairment was more pronounced than with the ethanol tests. On the following morning at the second retest, performance levels almost completely returned to those at the onset of testing. This restitution, however, was not as pronounced with subjects who had only received DPC.", 
    "6": "Reductive metabolism of p-nitrobenzoate (2 mM) was studied in the isolated perfused rat liver, after acute ethanol dosing, with use of a hemoglobin-free perfusion medium. Formation of reduced metabolites under control conditions (0.3 mumol per g of liver per hr) was enhanced fivefold (1.4 mumol/g/hr) in the presence of ethanol (38 mM), thus reaching hepatic reductase activities occurring under anaerobic conditions (1.4 mumol/g/hr). Ethanol failed to increase hepatic nitro reduction when alcohol dehydrogenase was inhibited by pyrazole. Addition of acetaldehyde led to a marked stimulation of nitroreductase activity. Carbon monoxide did not influence the ethanol-mediated enhancement of nitroreductase activity but almost abolished the enhancement caused by anoxia. Reductive azo cleavage of salazosulfamide was not enhanced by ethanol. When nitrazepam was used as the substrate (1 mM) for the isolated perfused rat liver, addition of ethanol (38 mM) led to an enhanced content of 7-amino derivative in the liver and in the perfusate, whereas the formation of 7-acetylamino derivative remained unchanged. The distribution of nitrazepam in liver and perfusate was not altered by ethanol.", 
    "7": "The management of sleep disorders in elderly patients with internal diseases consists in the first line in rectifying pathophysiological disregulations. Only in the second line, proper hypnotics are to be prescribed. When considered as indispensable, these medicaments are selected according to their toxicity and side effects. In present time, Benzodiazepines are definitely preferred, whereas neuroleptic, anti-depressant and the older drugs are to be taken secondarly in account.", 
    "8": "In experiments on rats the benzodiazepine tranquilizers diazepam (0.5 -- 1 mg/kg), nitrazepam (0.5 -- 5 mg/kg), phenazepam (0.5 -- 5 mg/kg) and grandaxin (5 mg/kg) facilitated the reaction of self-stimulation (RS), with electrodes implanted in the area of the lateral hypothalamus and medial fascicle of the forebrain. Increased doses of the tranquilizers (up to 10 mg/kg) depressed RS, diminished the searching activity and muscle tone. The tranquilizer elroquil belonging to the phenothiazine series depressed RS in doses 15--35 mg/kg. Diazepam (0.2 and 1 mg/kg), nitrazepam (0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg) and phenazepam (0.2 and 1 mg/kg) reduced the latent period of the reaction of active avoidance (RA) during aversive electric stimulation of the medial lemnisk. In doses of 10 mg/kg the drugs inhibited RA. Elroquil and grandaxin raised the latent period of RA within the dosage range studied. The drug effects and efficacious dose ranges varied among the tranquilizers.", 
    "9": "Diazepam and lorazepam differ in potency and in the time-course of their action. As a sedative, diazepam 10 mg is equivalent to lorazepam 2-2.5 mg. Diazepam is better absorbed after oral than after i.m. administrations but this does not apply to lorazepam. The clinical effect and amnesia begin more rapidly with diazepam, but last longer following lorazepam. Lorazepam is more effective than diazepam in blocking the emergence sequelae from ketamine. Lorazepam i.v. is followed by a lesser frequency of venous thrombosis.", 
    "10": "The effects on heart rate of injections of local anesthetics into the oral mucosa were studied in neuropsychiatric patients; these patients, in whom syncope had not occurred, had been hospitalized for a prolonged period. The heart rate in the neuropsychiatric patients decreased by only 3.9% in contrast to an average decrease of 12.6% in healthy adults. Diazepam was also effective in reducing the cardiac response. The lack of responsiveness in the trigeminal-vagal reflex may be a factor in protecting patients from syncope.", 
    "11": "The interaction of L-tryptophan and four benzodiazepine derivatives with tyrosine-modified human serum albumin was investigated by equilibrium dialysis and circular dichroism measurements. Out of the 18 tyrosine residues of the human serum albumin molecule, only 9 could be modified with tetranitromethane. At least up to a degree of modification of 5, the conformation of human serum albumin was not changed and no crosslinking and fractionation has been found, as revealed from circular dichroism measurements in the far ultraviolet range and from SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The modification of only 2 out of the 9 accessible tyrosine residues of human serum albumin strongly affects the binding of L-tryptophan and diazepam to their common, stereospecific bindining site. This was evidently shown by a reduction of the association constants by more than 90% and by a large reduction of the extrinsic Cotton effects of four benzodiazepines bound to human serum albumin. The numbers of binding sites remained unchanged. Strong evidence was presented that only one tyrosine residue, which reacts faster with tetranitromethane than all others, is mainly involved in the specific indole and benzodiazepine binding site of human serum albumin. The location of this highly reactive tyrosine residue and that of the specific indole and benzodiazepine binding site within the human serum albumin primary structure is discussed.", 
    "12": "Chlordiazepoxide (5.0, 10.0 mg/kg) reduced the rate of eating and extended the duration of feeding in a 10 min feeding test. It also reduced the latency to feed. Both fenfluramine (1.0 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine (0.25 mg/kg) acted to reduce food intake, but by differing mechanisms. Fenfluramine reduced eating rate without affecting eating duration, whilst d-amphetamine reduced eating duration without reducing eating rate. The effects of chlordiazepoxide on feeding parameters were generally additive with those of either d-amphetamine or fenfluramine, whenever chlordiazepoxide was given in combination with one of the anorectic drugs. Food texture affected feeding behaviour; rats ate standard diet in pellet form faster than powdered food, although they spent longer eating the powdered food. Textural differences did not significantly interact with the changes in feeding responses induced by the 3 drugs, except that latency to eat after either d-amphetamine or fenfluramine injection, when pellets were available, was significantly prolonged. Characterising drug effects on feeding in terms of a 2-dimensional matrix of eating rate and duration is recommended, rather than relying solely on amount of food consumption as the measure of drug effects.", 
    "13": "Our previously reported gas chromatographic--mass spectrometric assay for clonazepam using positive ion chemical ionization has been modified to employ negative ion chemical ionization. The sensitivity using this technique (less than 0.1 ng/ml) is approximately twenty times better than the positive ion chemical ionization procedure with similar precision. The method was used to determine the clonazepam plasma concentration in one human for 96 h following a single 2-mg dose of clonazepam.", 
    "14": "Nitrazepam and its main urinary metabolites, 7-aminonitrazepam and 7-acetamidonitrazepam, free and conjugared, were determined from 24-h fractions of human urine after a single oral dose of 5 mg of nitrazepam. Nitrazepam and the metabolites were extracted before and after glusulase hydrolysis with benzene--dichloromethane (90:10) from a 1.0 ml sample. Methylnitrazepam and methylbromazepam served as internal standards. Recoveries were better than 90%. GLC analysis of nitrazepam was performed using a 63Ni electron-capture detector. The metabolites were measured by a dual flameless nitrogen selective detector. The detection limits were about 0.2 ng/ml for nitrazepam and 50 ng/ml for the metabolites. The nitrogen-selective detector responds similarly to all three compounds. The 63Ni electron-capture detector gives very poor response to 7-amino-nitrazepam but allows very sensitive detection of nitrazepam. Combined use of the two detectors gives valuable information about the metabolic profile of nitrazepam.", 
    "15": "During the last decade there has been a substantial increase in the number of poisonings due to tricyclic antidepressants in both children and adults. The main toxic manifestations are of anticholinergic origin, and the most frequent constitute the so-called central anticholinergic syndrome. Most of the deaths result from the cardiac complications. Three cases are presented that illustrate chiefly the toxic manifestations related to the central nervous system. The therapeutic management is reviewed in the light of the metabolism of the tricyclic antidepressants, their pharmacologic action and the mechanism of their toxic effects.", 
    "16": "A double-blind randomized controlled study with pirenzepine (75 mg/day), cimetidine (1 g/day) and placebo was performed in 50 consecutive out-patients with duodenal ulcer. The patients also received an antacid containing aluminium hydroxide. Pirenzepine, cimetidine and placebo had similar effects on the 4-week healing rate. Dryness of the mouth was more frequent with pirenzepine than with the other two types of treatment. The incidence of other side effects did not differ in the three groups. A tendency towards more rapid disappearance of subjective symptoms in the patients treated with pirenzepine was not statistically significant. In conclusion, pirenzepine and cimetidine were not superior to placebo in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.", 
    "17": "Five benzodiazepine drugs (diazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam hydrochloride, nitrazepam, and triazolam) were evaluated separately in 15 sleep laboratory studies. Rebound insomnia, a worsening of sleep compared with baseline, occurred following withdrawal of triazolam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam after they had been given in only single, nightly doses for short periods. The rebound insomnia was attributed to the short and intermediate half-lives of these drugs. Diazepam and flurazepam, which have longer half-lives, did not cause rebound insomnia on withdrawal. Rebound insomnia may play a role in the development of hypnotic drug dependence with shorter-acting benzodiazepine drugs.", 
    "18": "The effects of morphine, diazepam and three neuroleptic agents (chloropromazine, perphenazine and haloperiodol) on neuronal firing rats were studied in the limbic system of immobilized cats. Parietal craniotomy was carried out under 1.5--4.0% halothane. Extracellular potentials from single cells in the cingulate gyrus, septum and lateral hypothalamic areas were recorded using glass-coated, platinum-iridium microelectrodes. In general, intravenous adminstration of morphine sulfate augmented the spontaneous firing rates of most of the neurons studied. In contrast, diazepam produced a marked attenuation of both spontaneous and morphine augmented firing rates, whereas the neuroleptic agents had no significant or consistent effects on the morphine augmented firing rates of neurons in these limbic areas. These data indicate that the limbic system may play an important role in the behavioral excitement in cats induced by morphine administration and also the depressant effect of the tranquilizer diazepam. In contrast, the inability of the neuroleptic agents to antagonize the morphine augmented neuronal firing rates suggest these agents may act outside the limbic areas studied here.", 
    "19": "Plasma concentrations of nitrazepam were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in: young healthy volunteers, in geriatric and psychiatric patients and in epileptic children. The disposition of nitrazepam was described in terms of a two-compartment open model. After a single oral dose of nitrazepam 5 mg the most prominent differences between the experimental groups were in the beta-phase half-life mean 29 h in the young volunteers and 40 h in geriatric patients , and in the apparent volume of distribution during the beta-phase of 2.4 vs 4.8 1/kg. Total plasma clearance and the average steady state concentration in both groups were equal. The plasma level rose at a rate proportional to the beta-phase half-life, and so, they were achieved more rapidly in the young than in the old subjects (3.5 vs 7.5 d). No change in steady-state level or in the half-life of nitrazepam were found during long term treatment, which indicates lack of enzyme induction or inhibition. In 95% of the epileptic children with a good to fair clinical response, the plasma concentration of nitrazepam was 40-180 ng/ml (mean 114 ng/ml). As all of the patients were on combined antiepileptic therapy, no attempt was made to correlate plasma level with therapeutic response.", 
    "20": "Clorazepate 20 mg was given i.m. to 49 mothers during the first stage of labour. The elimination of the drug was studied in 27 newborns produced by these mothers. The same dose was given to 13 women who underwent amniocentesis and to 7 women who were breast-feeding. \"Total nordiazepam\", i.e. the sum of clorazepate and its metabolite nordiazepam, was determined by gas-liquid chromatography in maternal blood, umbilical cord blood (both arterial and venous), amniotic fluid and in milk. Clorazepate was found to cross the placental barrier slowly, but nordiazepam was transferred more rapidly. Nordiazepam was found in the milk and in the blood of neonates after breast-feeding had started.", 
    "21": "A single dose of clorazepate 20 mg was injected i.m. in 7 pregnant and 7 non-pregnant women. Blood samples were collected for one week, and urine was collected for 24 h after the dose. The concentrations of clorazepate and its metabolite nordiazepam were determined by electron capture gas liquid chromatography. There was no difference between the two groups on physical examinations. Clorazepate was rapidly absorbed and the peak concentration was reached within 2 h. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for clorazepate were absorption half life 0.77 h in pregnant women and 0.56 h in non-pregnant women; elimination half life 1.3 h in pregnant women and 2.0 h in non-pregnant women; volume of distribution: 0.43 1 . kg-1 in the pregnant women and 0.33 1 . kg-1 in non-pregnant women. Nordiazepam reached its peak concentration within 12 h after dosing; its mean half life of elimination was 180 h in pregnant women and 60 h in non-pregnant women. Within 24 h, 1.3% of the clorazepate was recovered in urine from pregnant women and 7% in urine from the non-pregnant women.", 
    "22": "A comparative study of the placental transfer to the foetus of three benzodiazepines was performed using a dual perfusion system of the human placental lobule. A transport fraction was calculated for each benzodiazepine and was compared with reference substances. Relative to antipyrine, the transport fraction of diazepam was 85%, and that of nordiazepam was 84%. The transport fraction of clorazepate represented only 20% of that of tritiated water. The relatively high transfer of diazepam and nordiazepam can be attributed to their high lipid solubility, and the lower transfer of clorazepate is due to its polar nature. It is suggested that in certain instances this benzodiazepine may be of especial value to obstetricians.", 
    "23": "Single and repeated administration of neuroleptics induce supersensitivity to dopamine agonists like apomorphine and methylphenidate. The degree of this supersensitivity depends on the period of the preceding administration of the neuroleptic. In the development phase additional administration of apomorphine can reverse the hyperdopaminergic behaviour, whereas addition of cholinergic/anticholinergic treatment does not modify the enhanced receptor response. In the supersensitivity phase additional treatment with deanol does not modify the supersensitivity. Pheobarbital, diazepam, and muscimol increase and cis (Z)-flupenthixol decreases the supersensitivity. It is concluded that supersensitivity induced by neuroleptics is time-dependent and that it can be prevented by additional treatment with DA-agonists but not by cholinergic/anticholinergic treatment. In the supersensitivity phase, the syndrome is suppressed by dopamine antagonists but enhanced by GABA-agonists, benzodiazepine and phenobarbital.", 
    "24": "Sixteen male students received bedtime placebo and flurazepam 30 mg at home in a counter-balanced double-blind, crossover design. For 24 h after each treatment the subjects' spontaneous motor activity was recorded each 15 min with an unobtrusive actometer, worn as the subjects attended classes. The circadian activity curves were submitted to cosinor analyses. The 24 h post-flurazepam activity was a mean of 15.1% lower than post-placebo activity (P less than 0.025). On the average, both the nocturnal through and the daytime peak of motility dropped; the latter change was greater, reducing by a mean of 19.4% the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of activity (P greater than 0.01). the timing, or phase, of the rhythm was not shifted. Although the drug did not consistently modify reports of subjective feelings on the Profile of Mood States (POMS), 13 subjects correctly discriminated drug from placebo sessions (P less than 0.05). A bedtime dose of 30 mg of flurazepam appears to significantly reduce spontaneous human motility that night and during the next day. Activity recording revealed an important residual, behavioral effect of the drug which was not reflected in POMS reports of subjective feelings, suggesting that activity recording may provide a more sensitive measure for psychotropic drug effects.", 
    "25": "The typical Geller-Seifter conflict paradigm for predicting clinical efficacy of anxiolytics is a mult VI/CRF schedule in which response rates in the CRF (conflict) portion are depressed by response-contingent electric shock. In 1-h sessions, anxiolytics raise the depressed conflict rates. Recently it was shown that replacing the single shock level with an arrangement whereby shock begins at zero and is increased with each response in the conflict portion produced more orderly data and facilitated training and maintenance of experimental subjects; chlordiazepoxide was the test drug. In the present study, those results are replicated in 30-min sessions, and the incremental paradigm is demonstrated to be as specific for anxiolytics as the standard Geller-Seifter paradigm. The possibility of very short sessions is suggested.", 
    "26": "Recent advances in drug therapy for epilepsy have contributed to the reduction in the proportion of persons whose epilepsy is uncontrolled. New knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin has led to a better understanding of the drug's bioavailability and uses. Carbamazepine has recently been introduced for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic and partial seizures. Clonazepam has been found of particular benefit in the treatment of absence and myoclonic seizures. Valproic acid is a promising antiepileptic drug with broad-spectrum activity, and is particularly useful in the treatment of absence and myoclonic seizures, although further clinical experience is required before it can supplant ethosuximide as the preferred drug for the treatment of absence seizures. Monitoring of the plasma concentration of antiepileptic drugs has added greatly to the achievement of optimal drug therapy and the prevention of toxic effects.", 
    "27": "In a prospective study of 43,117 people, prescriptions issued by general practitioners over two years were linked with records of hospital admissions and deaths. For 57 people injured or killed while driving cars, motorcycles, or bicycles the medicines that had been dispensed in the three months before were compared with those dispensed for 1,425 matched controls. There was a highly significant association between use of minor tranquillisers and the risk of a serious road accident (relative risk estimate 4.9). the increased risk of accidents to drivers given tranquillisers could be due to the known psychomotor effects of these drugs or to effects of the conditions being treated. Whatever the reason, patients taking drugs such as diazepam should be warned that they are at special risk.", 
    "28": "Six healthy volunteers participated in single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies of oral lorazepam. Following single 4-mg oral doses, peak plasma lorazepam concentrations ranging from 40 to 70 ng/ml were reached within 3 hr of the dose. Values of absorption half-life averaged 25 min (range 10.3-42.7 min), and elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) averaged 14.2 hr (range 8.4-23.9 hr). During 15 consecutive days of 3 mg per day administered in divided doses, accumulation to the steady-state condition was complete within several days of the initiation of therapy. Values of accumulation half-life (mean 21.1 hr) were slightly longer than t1/2beta, and the two were not well correlated. Observed accumulation ratios (mean 1.88) were very close to those predicted from the single-dose study (mean 1.77), but the correlation between the two (r = 0.51) was not significant in the small sample size. \"Washout\" half-life values (mean 14.9 hr) were highly correlated with t1/2beta (r = 0.92). Clearance of a single intravenous dose of antipyrine determined prior to the multiple-dose lorazepam study (mean 0.86 ml/min/kg) was essentially identical to that determined after the study (mean 0.87 ml/ min/kg). Overall, the rate and extent of lorazepam accumulation during multiple dosage were reasonably well predicted by the single-dose kinetic study. However, accurate prediction for any specific individual was not always achieved. Stimulation or inhibition by lorazepam of its own clearance probably does not explain imprecise prediction, since single-dose t1/2beta and washout half-life values were essentially identical. Furthermore, chronic lorazepam exposure has no apparent effect on hepatic hydroxylation capacity as measured by clearance of exogenously administered antipyrine.", 
    "29": "The precipitate which forms upon dilution of diazepam injection with aqueous vehicles is shown conclusively to be diazepam and not benzoates. The results are based on GC-MS analysis of the precipitate as compared with a synthetic mixture of benzoic acid-diazepam.", 
    "30": "The effect of Althesin, diazepam, ketamine, propanidid and thiopentone on the release of acetylcholine was tested at the mouse neuromuscular junction. Althesin, diazepam and thiopentone increased the quantal content of the end-plate potential. Ketamine at low concentration (3.6 micromol litre-1) had a similar effect, but at high concentration (116.7 micromol litre-1) quantal content decreased sharply. Propanidid and cremophor EL did not affect quantal content. The increase in quantal content antagonized the effect of postsynaptic depression on the amplitude of the end-plate potential. The lack of enhancement of acetylcholine release appears to explain the in vitro interaction of propanidid with tubocurarine. The diversity of presynaptic actions of these drugs makes it unlikely that this is an important mechanism in producing anaesthesia.", 
    "31": "Similar levels of water consumption were induced in two groups of rats by means either of prior fluid deprivation or a schedule of food pellet delivery. Injections of d-amphetamine (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) had similar attenuating effects of drinking induced by both procedures. Chlordiazepoxide (2.5, 5.0, 10 and 20 mg/kg), however, exerted differential actions on schedule-induced and deprivation-induced drinking. Drinking induced by deprivation was facilitated by all doses of this drug while the higher doses decreased levels of schedule-induced drinking. This result emphasises the difficulties involved in using the concept of thirst in explanations of behavior and of drug action.", 
    "32": "THIP, a cyclic analogue of muscimol, is a powerful GABA agonist. It is as active as GABA in displacing [3H]muscimol from its binding site to cerebellar membranes (IC50 = 31.5 +/- 2.5 mM). However, unlike muscimol or GABA, it is devoid of any modulatory interaction with the benzodiazepine binding site on rat's cortical membranes. Homotaurine, isoguvacine and imidazole acetic acid are less active than muscimol and GABA for increasing the affinity of [3H]diazepam to cortical membrane preparations.", 
    "33": "EEG's were carried out on two hundred and one (201) alcoholics admitted to a four week treatment program. The majority were grossly intoxicated on admission and presented the usual differential problems during the first few days of hospitalization. In spite of therapeutic doses of medication before testing, 85% had totally normal EEG's and only 5.5% revealed clearly abnormal tracings. Of those for whom repeat records were later obtained, four of six with an abnormality showed a persistance of abnormality suggesting underlying organic dysfunction and not just \"intoxication\". EEG has a place in identification of the alcoholic patient at greater risk for neurological complications and may be useful in alerting the psychiatrist to obtain additional personal and family history, neurological examination, and when appropriate, further tests for potential structural abnormality. Routine use of structural tests such as computerized scan will aid in the identification of serious structural abnormalities but will not identify equally serious disorganizing functional abnormalities.", 
    "34": "R 33812 is being studied as an antiemetic adjuvant to anaesthesia for minor gynecological surgery. 150 patients received 10 mg Diazepam orally as a premedication and of these 3 groups of 50 received R 33812 in doses of 4 mg or 8 mg i.v. before anaesthesia or 10 mg orally together with premedication. Between series I and II a dose-related trend p = 0,065 was observed. No side effects were reported. The pharmacological interdependence of this combination is discussed as well as the consequences for general practice especially for the improved form of oral medication with R 33812.", 
    "35": "Reports of the prevalence of depression among alcoholics vary from 3% to 98%; the authors attribute this variation to the use of different diagnostic criteria. They used clinical diagnosis, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the MMPI to diagnose 35 men recently withdrawn from alcohol. The percentages of depression diagnosed were 8.6%, 28%, 66%, and 43%, respectively. The authors point out that the Hamilton, Zung, and MMPI scales are not diagnostic of depression in themselves and that accurate diagnosis of depression in alcoholics will reduce inappropriate treatment of nondepressed alcoholics and ensure careful treatment of the truly depressed.", 
    "36": "Of 144 patients with chronic pain of nonmalignant cause, 35 (24%) were drug-dependent, 59 (41%) drug abusers, and 50 (35%) nonabusers. Codeine and oxycodone (Percodan) were most frequently abused. In regard to characteristics tested, differences between the groups were not great; but there was a significant difference in outcome between nonabuse and dependent groups. Early detection and treatment of drug abuse should minimize some of the difficulties involved in management of treatment-resistive patients with chronic pain.", 
    "37": "The comparative therapeutic effects of desipramine hydrochloride and diazepam on the various symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated in a double-blind, parallel 4 week study of 53 psychoneurotic outpatients who manifested moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety. The median daily dose for the desipramine treated group was 150 mg; for the diazepam treated group, 20 mg. Patients who received desipramine scored significantly better than diazepam treated patients on 26 of the total of 51 variables derived from The Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression, The Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Anxiety, and 2 clinical global impressions. Patients who received diazepam scored significantly better on 1 variable, an item pertaining to sleep.", 
    "38": "The rat cerebellum contains a significant amount of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, cAMP-dependent and cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase, and a large concentration of protein kinase inhibitors. These inhibitors are thermostable proteins which can be separated by gel chromatography into two molecular forms: the type 1 and type 2 inhibitors of protein kinase (14). The type 1 inhibitor blocks the rat cerebellar cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity while the type 2 inhibitor blocks the cGMP-dependent protein kinase, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinases. The activity of the type 2 inhibitor increased or decreased in opposite direction to changes of cerebellar cGMP content generated by injection of 10 mg/kg harmaline 2.5 mg diazepam. No changes of type 1 inhibitor were observed under these conditions. The drug-induced shift of type 2 inhibitor of protein kinase was not mediated by changes in protein synthesis because it persisted after pretreatment with cycloheximide. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that cGMP modulates phosphorylation in cerebellum by changing the relationship between cGMP-dependent protein kinase and type 2 inhibitor content.", 
    "39": "Injections of pentylenetetrazol to mice produced a rise in steady state levels of cyclic AMP in the cerebrum and cerebellum subsequent to sacrifice by focused microwave irradiation. One hour pretreatment with anticonvulsant drugs--phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and diazepam--prevented this pentylenetetrazol-induced rise in cyclic AMP. Anticonvulsant agents which alone depressed steady state levels of cyclic AMP were phenytoin and carbamazepine in the cerebral cortex and carbamazepine in the cerebellum while elevations in the cyclic nucleotide were evoked by clonazepam in the cerebrum and cerebellum or diazepam and phenytoin in the cerebellum. Under in vitro conditions, in which incubated tissue slices of mouse cerebral cortex were used, the stimulation of cyclic AMP by norepinephrine was blocked by carbamazepine greater than phenobarbital greater than phenytoin. Inhibition of adenosine-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP was observed with phenobarbital greater than carbamazepine greater than phenytoin. Clonazepam enhanced this response to adenosine. Ouabain stimulation of cyclic AMP was prevented by carbamazepine, phenytoin greater than clonazepam greater than phenobarbital greater than diazepam. Only the highest concentrations (0.5 mM) of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine reduced the action of KCl on cyclic AMP elevation. Clonazepam and diazepam elevated the basal levels of the cyclic nucleotide.", 
    "40": "Intravenously or iontophoretically applied diazepam potentiated the depressant action of iontophoretically applied 5'-AMP on the spontaneous firing of rat cerebral cortical neurons. This potentiation of purinergic depression may be a result of the previously reported inhibition by diazepam of uptake of adenosine into brain tissues.", 
    "41": "A follow-up chart review was undertaken of 100 consecutive patients seen in psychiatric consultation for whom psychotropic medication was recommended. Significant differences in implementation (P less than 0.01) by class of drugs (neuroleptics, tricyclics, benzodiazepines) were found. Most often no discernible reason for consultee disagreement could be found or inferred. The importance of such follow-up studies for consultation work is stressed.", 
    "42": "This paper describes a rapid and simple procedure for the determination of benzodiazepines in biological samples. Five common benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam, clorazepate, flurazepam, and chlordiazepoxide) and/or their major metabolites are extracted from a buffered serum sample at pH 9.2 by a mixture of toluene, hexane, and isoamyl alcohol. The phases are separated by centrifugation, and a small aliquot of the organic layer is injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron-capture detector. The drugs are identified and quantitated by comparison with standards simultaneously processed similarly. A sample can be analyzed in about 30 min. The technique is illustrated by its application to sequential samples from a patient being treated for delirium tremens with large intravenous doses of diazepam. Serum diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, and oxazepam concentrations several times higher than usually encountered therapeutically were observed.", 
    "43": "A comparison has been made between the effects of the administration of flunitrazepam 1 mg i.v. and diazepam 10 mg i.v. in 90 female patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The drugs were given immediately before the skin incision as a booster to the induction agent thiopentone. The response to the incision, the quality of anaesthesia and the need for supplementary medication during maintenance were monitored. A standard post-anaesthesia interview was performed to evaluate the amnesic action and patient acceptability. The skin incision caused only slight increase in arterial pressure and heart rate in both groups. Only six patients of the diazepam group reacted to the incision with defensive movements. The overall quality of anaesthesia was better (P less than 0.05) and the need for supplementary doses of pethidine lower (P less than 0.01) in the flunitrazepam group. Recovery was equally good and the duration of sleep after operation was the same in both groups. The frequency of nausea after operation was low. The post-anaesthesia interview revealed that flunitrazepam possesses a more specific anterograde amnesic action than diazepam. Acceptability of the anaesthesia to the patient was equally good in both groups.", 
    "44": "Pethidine 1 mg kg-1, diazepam 0.25 mg kg-1 and flunitrazepam 0.02 mg kg-1 i.m. wer compared as premedicants in a double-blind study in 145 children undergoing otolaryngological surgery. Both flunitrazepam and pethidine had an anxiolytic effect in the children of less than 5 yr whereas diazepam had little effect. All of the drugs were anxiolytic in the children aged 5 yr and older. Sleep following thiopentone was restless more often in the younger than in the older children. Cardiovascular responses to thiopentone and to tracheal intubation were most obvious following benzodiazepines in children of less than 5 yr. After anaesthesia 10--33% of the older children could not recall pictures shown to them before anaesthesia. Forty-five (+/-SD 13) min after injection, the concentration of diazepam in serum was similar in both age groups; after 90 min it decreased in the younger and increased in the older children. All concentrations of flunitrazepam were significantly greater in the older compared with the younger children.", 
    "45": "A double-blind trial was conducted of two benzodiazepines, flunitrazepam and diazepam, given orally to 142 children (30 kg in weight or heavier) undergoing routine surgery. Flunitrazepam was associated with greater sedation before operation and less vomiting after operation than diazepam. Flunitrazepam caused a greater frequency of amnesia for the periods of induction and immediately after operation. Plasma concentrations were measured in 65 children and were found to be significantly greater in those children having amnesia for the induction period in both flunitrazepam and diazepam groups. In the diazepam group, plasma concentrations were significantly smaller in those who vomited than in those who did not vomit.", 
    "46": "Desmethyldiazepam--providing the long-term anticonvulsant effect when diazepam is given orally--is conveniently administered as clorazepate (Tranxene). In this study, clorazepate was compared to phenobarbital as a secondary anticonvulsant in eight ambulatory, adult outpatients. Stable doses of phenytoin were maintained throughout. Drowsiness was present in all on phenobarbital, but there were no clorazepate-related side effects. Seizure control did not differ for each treatment. Addition of common side effects of phenytoin and phenobarbital limited the attained serum levels of each when used together. Clorazepate doses in the 0.56-mg-per-kilogram range gave desmethyldiazepam levels in the 1.0-microgram-per-milliliter range. Induction of metabolism was suggested by falling desmethyldiazepam levels despite increasing doses. Clorazepate is an effective, nontoxic secondary anticonvulsant.", 
    "47": "A fluorometric procedure for clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, based on a fluorophore formed upon irradiation of the drug using short wavelength UV light (254 nm) for 35 min is presented. Fluorescence is linear over a 100-6400-ng/ml range using excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 400 nm, respectively. Application of the method to the determination of clobazam in spiked human plasma samples revealed that the drug can be determined at nanogram per milliliter levels with an accuracy of 1-5%. The procedure is specific for clobazam in samples containing its major plasma metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, and also in samples containing 1,4-benzodiazepines and other selected drugs. A plasma level-time profile after oral administration of a single 40-mg dose of clobazam to a healthy adult male is also illustrated.", 
    "48": "The new psychotropic drug phenazepam inhibits the impulse activity of the neurons which compose visceral ganglia of the garden snail (Helix aspersa) and suppresses stimulating postsynaptic potentials arising in application of acetylcholine to the membrane of isolated neurons. The electrostimulating membrane parameters are not generally changed. Postsynaptic depression of the stimulation of the cholinoreceptive membrane is suggested to be one of the possible mechanisms of the pharmacological action of the drug.", 
    "49": "Definitions of Delirium Tremens (DT) and related clinical states are discussed together with the concepts of aetiology and pathogenesis in relation to psychiatric disease. The withdrawal theory which considers reduction or cessation of alcohol intake as an important precipitating factor in DT is discussed; this theory is supported by experimental studies of ethanol withdrawal in man and by studies indicating cross dependence between ethanol and several other CNS depressors; the arguments in the literature for and against the withdrawal theory are discussed. Other possible aetiological factors such as type of liquor, hypovitaminosis, liver disease, dysfunction of the adrenals and fat emboli are reviewed, and it is concluded that these factors are unimportant as precipitating or specific aetiological factors in DT. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed, especially concerning electrolyte metabolism and cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. It is concluded that the pathophysiology of the disease is poorly understood, and some possibilities for future research are indicated. The discussion about treatment of DT is concentrated on drug treatment, and the literature concerning antipsychotics and sedatives is reviewed. It is concluded that barbital, a long-acting barbiturate, is the most effective treatment; diazepam can be recommended as an acceptable alternative. Finally, practical recommendations concerning treatment are given.", 
    "50": "Several drugs that are utilized primarily for their effects on the central nervous system also affect lower urinary tract function. Most of these effects are produced by the action of these drugs on adrenergic and cholinergic receptors or by direct action of lower urinary tract musculature. Central nervous system stimulants and depressants which are known to affect the storage or evacuation role of the lower urinary tract are discussed.", 
    "51": "The only metabolite of 2'-chloronordiazepam, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-(2'-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (1), previously identified in the dog is lorazepam (2), which is a product of 3-hydroxylation. Two phenolic metabolites (3 and 4) in the dog corresponding to 4'-hydroxylation of the 5-phenyl ring and 9-hydroxylation of the fused benzene ring, respectively, have now been identified. The structure of the 9-hydroxy isomer 4 is deduced simply from the observed NMR spectral AB (J meta = 2.5 Hz) pattern of the protons of the fused benzene ring. In contrast, since a 2'-chloro substituent is present on the 5-phenyl ring of the parent drug, the usual method of recognizing 4'-hydroxylation of this ring by observation of AA'BB' multiplets in the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra is inapplicable. Hence, a novel method is introduced to identify the 4'-hydroxy isomer 3, based on attributing different sets of NMR substituent effect parameters to hydroxyl groups, depending on whether these groups are meta or para to the benzodiazepinimine function. The urinary plus fecal excretion of 2-4 by one dog given in a single oral 10 mg/kg dose of 14C-labeled 1 amounted to 20, 5, and 7% of the dose, respectively; the urinary metabolites were excreted predominantly as conjugates of glucuronic acid and/or sulfate.", 
    "52": "To test for sustained hypnotic efficacy, triazolam (0.6 mg) or flurazepam (30 mg) was given to chronic insomniac patients for 7 consecutive nights in parallel, double-blind design. Triazolam at this dose was an effective hypnotic by all usual subjective measures and did not produce appreciable hangover. Flurazepam performed similarly. For either drug, comparison of the mean scores for the first 2 nights with that for the last 2 nights for any of the parameters did not reveal any significant difference. Thus, both triazolam and flurazepam showed sustained efficacy for 1 week at these doses. Some interesting theoretical and practical questions about the measurement of sustained efficacy of hypnotics in situations of repetitive dosing were addressed by the study. While a placebo control is desirable, the results obtained may be uninterpretable. An acute-care hospital setting may not be the ideal setting for doing such studies. There were indications from the study that the first-night results in a hypnotic clinical trial may be atypical.", 
    "53": "In the presence of low-intensity pulsed microwave radiation, at an average power density of 1 milliwatt per square centimeter, the response-rate-increasing effects of chlordiazepoxide were potentiated in rats. The behavioral effects of a drug can be modified by brief exposure to a low-level microwave field even when the radiation level alone has no apparent effects on the behavior.", 
    "54": "The clinical effects are reported of the benzodiazepine derivative, bromazepam (Lexotanil) in the treatment of psychosomatic disorders in the course of neurotic, psychovegetative, and masked depressive syndromes. The drug was administered orally in 301 patients (178 males, and 123 females). Target symptoms were anxiety, tension, and varied organic dysfunction of psychogenic origin. The optimum daily dosage was three times 3 mg; the duration of treatment ranged from 1 week to 34 months. The effect of treatment was considered excellent in 51.5%, good in 42.5%, moderate in 2%, and absent in 4%. The most responsive target symptoms were psychogenic disorders of the cardiovascular system and of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as anxiety, while no true antidepressive effect was observed. Drug tolerance is excellent. Slight fatigue, vertigo or a mild reduction in psychomotor activity were complained of by about 10% of the patients and usually occurred with daily doses of 18 mg or more, whereas no other side effects were observed. There was no obvious tendency to drug dependence even after after long-term treatment of up to 34 months. Bromazepam appears to be a superior compound to other anxiolytic and psychovegetatively active minor tranquillisers on account of its mild hypnotic action. Its anxiolytic effect causes additional indirect sleep induction in the above-mentioned conditions.", 
    "55": "Acute administration of 4 mg/kg d-amphetamine in the marmoset results in a large increase in small head movements (checking), an almost total suppression of purposeful activities and social interaction, but little change in the amount of locomotion. Checking behaviour is blocked in a dose dependent manner by 0.03--0.18 mg/kg haloperidol but not by propranolol, aceperone or diazepam, suggesting dopaminergic mediation of this behaviour. The loss of activities and social interaction after amphetamine is not antagonized by any of the drugs used in this study. Locomotion is decreased by haloperidol, propranolol and diazepam in amphetamine treated animals and by haloperidol and aceperone in normal animals."
