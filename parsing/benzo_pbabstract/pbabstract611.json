    "0": "Many reports on the excretion of drugs in human breastmilk were prepared during a period when pharmacologic assays lacked precision, sensitivity, and specificity and are based on accidental single case reports. This article critically reviews the evidence underlying drugs that are frequently contraindicated in nursing mothers. Specific medications and preparations examined include aspirin, bromides, iodides, thiouracil, chlorpromazine, lithium carbonate, benzodiazepines, ergot alkaloids, metronidazole, marijuana, chlormycetin, tetracyclines, antimetabolites, cathartics, anticoagulants, oral contraceptives, and radioactive materials. The review suggests that very few drugs are known to be absolutely contraindicated in nursing mothers. It is possible, however, that ingestion of small amounts of drugs may have subtle, undetected effects on infant growth and development. Thus, physicians are advised to prescribe drugs to lactating women only when there is a clear indication for its use. The pharmacokinetics of the drug should be taken into account in order to have the lower peak level in the milk at the time of feeding. Information on drugs that are not generally considered to be contraindicated in nursing mothers is presented in table form.", 
    "1": "The efficacy and safety of lormetazepam (LMZ) and placebo were compared in 30 patients with sleep difficulties who were treated by general practitioners. During the three weeks of the study, each patient received placebo during either the first or last week and 1 mg/night of LMZ during the other two weeks. Neither patients nor physicians knew which week's medication was active drug and which was placebo. Twenty-three of the 30 patients completed the three-week trial. Both the quantity and the quality of sleep were significantly better during the weeks patients were given LMZ than during the week they used placebo. Physicians also rated the hypnotic performance as significantly better than that of placebo. Adverse reactions were evenly distributed among the LMZ and placebo treatment periods and were usually minor. Vital signs and laboratory values were unchanged during either treatment period. It is thus concluded that LMZ is a safe and effective hypnotic for use in general practice.", 
    "2": "Midazolam, in an oral dose of 15 mg, and placebo were administered to 15 children aged 6-15 years in treatment of night terrors. After an initial adaptation night, the patients received placebo for 2 nights, followed by 15 mg midazolam for 2 nights and placebo again on the final 2 nights. Eight-hour nocturnal polygraphic recordings were made after the administration of both placebo and midazolam. The patients were continuously monitored by means of closed circuit infra-red television. Ten of the patients manifested simple episodes while five had attacks associated with motor automatisms and EEG anomalies. The total sleep time was lengthened by midazolam in most of the children; sleep architecture was favourably modified, mainly in terms of the amount and proportion of REM sleep (accompanied by dreams) and stage 2 sleep. Night terrors were eliminated by midazolam in all except one patient. REM sleep latency also decreased as did the number of nocturnal arousals (clinical and/or EEG). In the five cases with a background of organic cerebral disorders, the EEG anomalies and these attacks were suppressed by midazolam especially during the first sleep cycles. Patients' subjective assessment of the quality of sleep was favourable. Midazolam was well tolerated with no side-effects.", 
    "3": "Midazolam in doses of 0.21-0.46 mg/kg was given to four insomniacs for 27 days, and to a fifth insomniac for an additional 124 days, to assess its short, intermediate, long-term and long-standing efficacy. Automatic analysis of the polygraphic sleep recordings was carried out employing real-time signal processing (based on linear prediction), and an off-line sequential fuzzy clustering. Total sleep length did not vary significantly during medication, whereas other efficacy parameters such as sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset and number of nightly awakenings decreased significantly throughout the period of active medication. In one patient, midazolam was still effective after 151 days of administration. The ultrashort action (probably 3-4 h) of midazolam could be demonstrated by the distribution of the efficacy parameters, dividing the night into 2-h periods, by the unchanged total sleep length during medication compared with baseline and by the lack of any subjective clinical symptoms of hangover. The quantitative analysis of the signals showed that, although a decrease in the total amount of slow-wave sleep during long-term medication and withdrawal was detected, the total relative power in the delta band increased during drug administration. This was interpreted as redistribution of the delta activity during active medication. A lengthening of REM sleep was found during active medication probably attributable to intranight rebound. This was not followed by any clinical symptom of clinical REM rebound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The effects of midazolam (15 and 30 mg p.o.) on the sleep of insomniac patients were assessed by means of polysomnographic recordings. As compared with placebo, 15 mg midazolam significantly increased non-REM sleep while other objective measures of insomnia were only slightly modified. At the 30 mg dose, midazolam significantly decreased total wake time and wake time after sleep onset. On the other hand, total sleep and non-REM sleep time were increased. No development of tolerance was observed following 2 weeks of drug use.", 
    "5": "Midazolam (15 mg p.o.) was compared with placebo and oxazepam (15 mg) in 12 healthy volunteers and in seven patients suffering from sleep disorders in a single-blind cross-over study. Each treatment period lasted for seven days. The last two nights were spent in a sleep laboratory to evaluate the efficacy of the three compounds. The drugs were given to the patients every day and to the volunteers only on the recorded nights immediately before going to bed. The subjects rated their quality of sleep every morning after administration. Midazolam shortened (P = 0.025) the sleep latency to first stage 2 (t2 = 29 min) compared with placebo (t2 = 58.7) min and oxazepam (t2 = 55.4 min) in the group of patients; in the group of volunteers t2 was shortened (P = 0.05) only by midazolam (t2 = 17.2 min) compared with placebo (t2 = 24.6 min). REM suppression was not found in the group of patients, while sleep stages 3 + 4 were slightly reduced. However, a suppression of REM by midazolam (P = 0.025) and oxazepam (P = 0.01) was observed in the volunteers compared with placebo. The effects of midazolam seemed to be related to its pharmacokinetics. The drug increased the amount of stage 3 + 4 (P = 0.01) and suppressed REM (P = 0.005) compared with oxazepam and placebo, only during the first 3 h, when it was measurable in plasma. Midazolam was rated by the patients more favourably than oxazepam (P = 0.025) and placebo (P = 0.05). The volunteers noted no difference amongst the three treatments, but reported hangover effects after oxazepam.", 
    "6": "The effect of 15 mg midazolam and 15 mg oxazepam compared with placebo was investigated in 12 shift-workers in a randomized cross-over sleep laboratory study with psychometric testing. Sleep latency was normal under all experimental conditions. Midazolam shortened the sleep latency, reduced the frequency of nocturnal awakenings, and increased the length of sleep stages 3 and 4. Both midazolam and oxazepam reduced the total waking time and prolonged the total sleep time. Neither of the two benzodiazepines negatively influenced performance after awakening. On the basis of these findings, midazolam would appear to be suited for the treatment of insomnia in shift-workers or of other situational sleep disturbances.", 
    "7": "The aim of the study was to compare the pharmacological activity and clinical effect after i.v. administration of midazolam, triazolam and their hydroxy metabolites, and, secondly, to compare the clinical effects of midazolam and triazolam in doses yielding the same duration of action (15 mg and 0.25 mg, respectively). In a randomized, cross-over procedure, six healthy volunteers received one of the following in the morning at approximately weekly intervals: 15 mg midazolam; 9 mg alpha-hydroxy midazolam; 1 mg triazolam; 1 mg alpha-hydroxy triazolam; 1 mg 4-hydroxy triazolam. Tests of drug effect (investigator's assessment, psychometric testing, and self-rating by subjects) were carried out at different times in the 24-h period following administration. Triazolam 0.25 mg was also studied in four of these six subjects to supplement the findings in the cross-over study. Triazolam 1 mg was shown to have the strongest, most long-lasting effect. Midazolam 15 mg had almost the same intensity of effect but this was shorter lasting, i.e. 5 h as against 10 h for 1 mg triazolam. The alpha-hydroxy metabolites had a duration of action about half that of the parent compounds and a less potent effect, and 4-hydroxy triazolam was virtually devoid of effect. The lower 0.25-mg dose of triazolam had about the same duration of action as 15 mg midazolam but did not achieve the same degree of maximum effect as measured by psychometric tests and self-assessment by subjects. The findings of this study indicate that midazolam would be suitable for use in situations in which a brief but intense hypnotic sedative effect is desired.", 
    "8": "In a double-blind, cross-over study in six healthy volunteers, the effects of different oral doses of midazolam (10, 20 and 40 mg), or 0.15 mg kg-1 midazolam administered intravenously and of placebo were investigated. Plasma concentrations of midazolam and of its active alpha-hydroxy metabolite were measured at the same time. The effect was assessed using objective and subjective methods (reaction time, tracing test, subjects' self-assessment and investigator's subjective assessment). The respective time courses of the plasma concentration and of the effect (reaction time, number of errors in the tracing test) were almost identical. Peak plasma levels and maximum effects were attained within 30 min. In general, the effect after intravenous injection of 0.15 mg kg-1 and after an oral dose of 10 mg midazolam lasted for 2 h following administration and its duration was doubled (i.e. to 4 h) after the 20 mg oral dose. Between the logarithm of the plasma concentration and the effect, there is a sigmoidal relationship that is virtually time independent. Particularly in the first few hours after oral administration the effect is intensified by the alpha-hydroxy metabolite of midazolam which is formed by first-pass metabolism. At identical plasma concentrations of midazolam, the oral dose produced more marked effects than did the intravenous administration. Correlation of the measured effects with the total (midazolam + alpha-hydroxy midazolam) plasma concentration reveals a closer sigmoidal relationship.", 
    "9": "Not only has insomnia become much more frequent in the last hundred years but its causes have also changed considerably. In the treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines--because of their additional anxiolytic effect--offer substantial advantages over other sleep-inducing agents. The residual fraction--the quotient of plasma concentration at 12 h after drug intake to maximum plasma concentration--makes it possible to differentiate between the benzodiazepines according to their suitability as anxiolytics or hypnotics. Midazolam has the lowest residual fraction of all known benzodiazepines and thus, administered in the appropriate dosage, also has the shortest duration of activity.", 
    "10": "The pharmacokinetic behaviour and the bioavailability of midazolam were investigated in six volunteers after intravenous (0.15 mg/kg) and oral administration (10, 20 and 40 mg). Following rapid intravenous injection of midazolam, the plasma concentration of the substance decreased to approximately 10% within 2 h owing to a rapid rate of distribution. A two compartment model adequately described the kinetics of midazolam in plasma. The following average values were found: elimination half-life, 2.3 h; total clearance, 323 ml/min, and apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (VSS), 50.21. After oral administration, the drug is rapidly absorbed. Maximum plasma levels are reached within 30 min and the drug is rapidly eliminated from plasma with practically the same half-life as determined after i.v. administration. The bioavailability after the ingestion of 10, 20 and 40 mg midazolam in the form of tablets ranged from 31 to 72%, due to the high liver extraction quota of midazolam.", 
    "11": "The LD50 in the rat and the mouse is about 1600 mg/kg (oral administration) and 75 mg/kg (rat) and 50 mg/kg (mouse) on intravenous administration. Subchronic oral studies over 13 weeks in doses of 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg/day in the dog and 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day in the rat have demonstrated minimal toxicity for midazolam, as for other benzodiazepines. High doses produced increased liver weight in the rat and the expected increases in alkaline phosphatase in the dog (species-specific reaction). Detailed blood and urine analyses as well as histological examination of organs produced no indication of changes relevant for man. Subchronic parenteral studies (i.v. and i.m. for five weeks) using up to 6 mg/kg/day in dogs and rats showed the compound to be not only systemically, but also locally, extremely well tolerated. Reproduction toxicology studies have shown that midazolam is neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic and that it has no effect on the fertility and post-natal development of animals. In the AMES test and the fluctuation test, midazolam had no mutagenic effect.", 
    "12": "The effect of the new, short-acting benzodiazepine, midazolam as well as that of triazolam and flunitrazepam on the sleep of rabbits was recorded for 6 h. Midazolam at 1 mg kg-1 i.v. augmented both rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REM sleep (NREMS) only in the first half of the observation period. At 10 mg kg-1 i.v., NREMS was further increased in the first and, to a lesser degree, in the second 3-h period, while REMS was suppressed. Both doses were less effective orally than intravenously. Qualitatively, the effect of triazolam 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg-1 i.v. was very similar to that of the corresponding low and high intravenous doses of midazolam, except that the high dose of triazolam had a prolonged effect on total sleep time. Like midazolam, triazolam was substantially less effective orally than intravenously. Flunitrazepam at 0.1 and 1 mg kg-1 i.v. produced almost the same effects as midazolam and triazolam at the respective low and high intravenous doses, but had a longer duration of action. In contrast to midazolam and triazolam, flunitrazepam was almost as active orally as intravenously.", 
    "13": "By virtue of its physico-chemical properties and its rapid biotransformation, midazolam is an important addition in certain areas in anaesthesia. Of particular importance are its good local tissue tolerance after intramuscular injection, the absence of venous irritation, and the rapid start of metabolism with good control of action. Midazolam is suitable for both oral and intramuscular administration as premedication in anaesthesia. The compound can also be used for the induction of anaesthesia in combination with analgesics.", 
    "14": "The hypnotic efficacy and the effect on the condition after morning awakening of midazolam 15 mg and of triazolam 0.5 mg were studied in a multicentre, double-blind cross-over study in 198 out-patients with sleeping difficulties of various origin. The subjects received each drug for two consecutive nights, and completed a questionnaire each day on awakening. Both midazolam and triazolam significantly shortened the sleep-onset latency, reduced the number of awakenings, and increased the total sleep time. The state on awakening was also significantly improved after both compounds for several self-rated items. There was a difference only with regard to the patients' feeling of being under drug influence, which was reported as being significantly more marked after triazolam. In conclusion, both compounds were effective and well tolerated in the doses used, only a few side-effects being reported.", 
    "15": "The use of hypnotics in the elderly must be approached with special care in view of possible changes in pharmacokinetic behaviour and drug interactions in older patients. In a randomized, double-blind study in a large geriatric department, midazolam was compared with the barbiturate combination Vesparax with regard to efficacy and safety. The comparison of the efficacy of the 2 hypnotics showed them to be almost identical in this respect. Side-effects, however, were more frequent with Vesparax. Furthermore, in the Vesparax group, unlike in the midazolam group, a troublesome cumulation of effect was observed, together with relatively frequent signs of hangover. It is concluded that, in appropriately titrated dosage, midazolam is an effective and well-tolerated hypnotic for use in the elderly.", 
    "16": "Midazolam, a new imidazobenzodiazepine, forms salts that are stable in water solution, and has an overall pharmacological potency similar to that of diazepam but a much shorter duration of action. It produces all the characteristic effects of the benzodiazepine class. Its metabolites account for only a negligible part, if any, of its pharmacological effects observed in the mouse. The time course of its anticonvulsant activity, studied with different experimental protocols and by different routes of administration, revealed an almost immediate onset of action. Midazolam was slightly more potent, and its duration of action was shorter than diazepam, in enhancing presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord of cats and in depressing spontaneous activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells in the rat. Midazolam decreased spontaneous multiunit activity (MUA) in different nuclei of the brain in 'enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9' rats. This depression was reversed by Ro 15-1788, a recently discovered selective benzodiazepine antagonist. Midazolam and diazepam decreased the cyclic GMP level in the cerebellum of rats with about the same potency; the effect of midazolam was of much shorter duration than that of diazepam. Midazolam had one-third the potency of diazepam in displacing 3H-flunitrazepam in mouse brain in vivo, and also in this case the effect of midazolam was of brief duration, as compared with diazepam. Midazolam in therapeutic doses was virtually ineffective in the cardiovascular system of conscious dogs after p.o. or i.v. administration. No direct effects of the drug on autonomic functions were found. The animal data suggest the usefulness of midazolam as an oral sleep-inducer, as an agent for i.v. induction of anaesthesia and as an i.v. or i.m. anticonvulsant in status epilepticus or tetanus, because of its rapid onset of action and its excellent local tolerance as water-soluble injection form.", 
    "17": "In a double-blind parallel study in which a placebo phase preceded and followed the double-blind verum phase, midazolam 15 mg and Vesparax (150 mg secobarbital, 50 mg brallobarbital, 50 mg hydroxyzine) were administered to 30 female patients aged 20-76 years, suffering from insomnia secondary to neuromuscular disease. Both products were shown to be efficient hypnotics maintaining a constant level of effect. Midazolam proved to be better tolerated and, in contrast to Vesparax, did not cause hangover, nor did rebound phenomena ensue after its withdrawal.", 
    "18": "A double-blind study was conducted in 60 female patients with moderate or severe insomnia, hospitalized for gynaecological surgery. After an initial 2-day placebo selection phase, 30 subjects received 15 mg midazolam and the remaining 30 received 1 tablet Vesparax (= 50 mg hydroxyzine, 150 mg secobarbital, 50 mg brallobarbital) for 5 nights. This verum phase was immediately followed by a 2-day placebo withdrawal phase in order to study the occurrence of rebound phenomena. Both verum compounds were effective in hastening sleep onset, increasing sleep duration, and improving sleep quality, without causing residual effects on the following day. There was no difference in effect between the two agents. Neither active drug caused rebound effects on withdrawal.", 
    "19": "This double-blind study in 60 hospitalized female patients comparing midazolam 15 mg, oxazepam 15 mg and placebo, demonstrated an inter-group difference in favour of midazolam with regard to efficacy. The sleep parameters of onset latency and duration were improved by midazolam. All three compounds were very well tolerated and no withdrawal symptoms were observed. Midazolam, in an oral dose of 15 mg, can thus be regarded as an effective, well-tolerated agent for the treatment of sleep disorders.", 
    "20": "The efficacy and safety of midazolam compared with oxazepam and placebo were investigated in 50 hospital patients (19 males, 31 females; age range 21 to 74 years) in a double-blind parallel group study. On the first 2 nights (selection phase), patients received only placebo. On the next 5 nights, they received either 15 mg midazolam, 15 mg oxazepam or placebo. They received no medication on the last 2 nights and were kept under observation (withdrawal phase). Compared with placebo, both benzodiazepines shortened sleep onset latency, reduced the number of awakenings and improved sleep quality. All 3 compounds were well tolerated with only few, mild side-effects (headache, nausea) in the 2 verum groups. Psychometric performance was not impaired on the morning following drug administration. The overall patients' assessments showed 80% satisfaction with midazolam, 66% with oxazepam and 10% with placebo. Midazolam and oxazepam yielded similar results, although midazolam induced sleep more rapidly and was rated more favourably by the patients. Midazolam, in a dose of 15 mg, is thus an effective, fast-acting, well-tolerated hypnotic without residual effects and is suitable for the treatment of insomnia of mild to moderate degree. Oxazepam in a dose of 15 mg is also well suited for the treatment of sleep disorders, particularly if a rapid onset of action is not required.", 
    "21": "Fifty-nine hospitalized patients participated in a double-blind study: 19 received 15 mg midazolam, 20 received 50 mg oxazepam, and 20 placebo. The three groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, height, weight, and degree and type of insomnia. The sleep-onset latency was shorter with midazolam than with placebo or oxazepam (Mann-Whitney test, alpha less than 0.05). With regard to total sleep duration and the number of nocturnal awakenings, there was no difference between the midazolam and oxazepam groups, whereas there was a difference between these two groups and placebo. More subjects of the midazolam group felt calm and refreshed on awakening. Safety, assessed by clinical examination and laboratory tests, was excellent. This study confirms the usefulness of midazolam in treating 'early' insomnia, i.e. difficulty in falling asleep.", 
    "22": "In a multicentre, double-blind, parallel study performed in 78 hospitalized patients who complained of mild, moderate or severe insomnia, the efficacy and safety of 15 mg midazolam were compared with those of 15 mg oxazepam, both orally administered. The results showed statistically significant better results in the onset of sleep in the patients treated with midazolam. Other sleep parameters, such as quality and duration of sleep as well as the condition of the patients on morning awakenings, were also improved in more patients treated with midazolam. Safety (clinical and biological) was very good in both groups of patients.", 
    "23": "Three different dosage studies were carried out with midazolam in 47 institutionalized geriatric patients (17 males: mean age 82.9 years; 30 females: mean age 81.3 years) who were suffering from insomnia of long standing. Study I investigated the hypnotic efficacy of midazolam versus placebo in a double-blind, cross-over trial comparing the 7.5 and 15 mg doses of midazolam in 18 subjects. Both midazolam doses shortened sleep onset latency by 40 min (15 mg) and 31 min (7.5 mg). Both doses increased total sleep time compared with placebo. In study II, a comparative, cross-over trial in 10 subjects, an initial dose of 7.5 mg midazolam was sufficient to reduce the subjective appreciation of sleep onset time to less than 60 min on 66 of 70 study nights. Oxazepam (25 mg) had a comparable favourable effect but less frequently (53 of 70 nights). In study III, individual dose limits were investigated in 19 insomniac patients. The minimum effective dose was 7.5 mg. The maximum tolerated dose was in the range 15 to 52.5 mg according to the subjects' assessment. The most common optimum dose was 15 mg (10 of 19 patients). The higher doses prolonged sleep but midazolam appears to have a wide margin of safety as residual sedative effects appeared only after very high doses (four of 19 for 30 mg; eight of 19 for 37.5 mg). In some patients, 7.5 mg was the minimum dose that was effective in shortening sleep latency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The hypnotic effect of midazolam on the sleep of pre-surgical patients was studied in 99 patients (53 males, 46 females) due to undergo surgery the following day. One tablet of 15 mg midazolam was administered at 21.00 h and a second was given 45 min later if the subject had not fallen asleep, sleep-onset latency being measured from the time the second tablet was taken. Eighty patients required 1 tablet and 19 required 2 tablets. According to the subjective assessment, patients receiving 1 tablet fell asleep in 22.9 +/- 14.9 min and those taking 2 tablets fell asleep in 38.4 +/- 25.3 min (difference significant P less than 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the 1- and 2-tablet groups with regard to sleep duration, number of awakenings, overall assessment of the night's sleep, sleep quality and state on awakening. Factors which had a statistically significant influence on the dosage requirement were (a) sex, 30.4% females requiring a second tablet v. 9.4% males; (b) age, the mean age of the 2-tablet group being 36.5 v. 47 years in the lower dose group; (c) weight, patients with lower body weight requiring the higher dosage, mean 57.5 v. 66 kg; (d) current insomnia or a history of sleeping problems; (e) previous use of hypnotics; (f) degree of insomnia, moderate/severe insomnia needing a higher dosage (42% v. 21%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Twelve healthy volunteers each received acute doses of placebo and 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg of midazolam. Seven subjects were tested before and 1, 4 and 7 h after treatment. Five subjects were given the same five treatments nocturnally and tested the following morning, 10-12 h after treatment. Tests on various measures of sedation (choice reaction time and critical flicker fusion) and of drowsiness (line analogue rating scales) showed midazolam at 15 and 20 mg dose levels to be a potent sedative agent. The present results suggest that the activity of midazolam is at a maximum 1 h after ingestion and that the effects of the drug have dissipated 7 h after treatment.", 
    "26": "Effects of 10, 20 and 30 mg midazolam on sleep and on performance the next day were studied in six healthy adult males aged between 47 and 53 years. The study was double-blind, placebo-controlled and included another rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine (brotizolam, 0.25 mg) as an active control. With 10 mg midazolam, sleep-onset latency was quicker, and the duration and percentage of stage 2 sleep was increased over the first 6 h. Effects of 20 and 30 mg midazolam were similar to each other. Sleep onsets were earlier, total sleep times and stage 2 sleep were increased, and the sleep efficiency indices improved. During the first 6 h there was reduced duration and percentage of drowsy (stage 1) sleep. There was no consistent evidence of delay to the first period of rapid eye movement sleep, but over the dose range the duration was reduced during the first 2 h. Digit symbol substitution did not show any residual decrement 9 h after ingestion of 10, 20 or 30 mg midazolam. Midazolam may prove to be a particularly useful hypnotic for shiftworkers whose rest periods tend to be shorter than in those who have a regular nocturnal sleep pattern.", 
    "27": "A short review is given of the basic chemical development in the field of 'classical' and 'annelated' benzodiazepines, distinguishing between pro-drugs and directly acting compounds. Some properties of midazolam that are of special interest for its practical use are discussed, such as: the basicity of its imidazole ring nitrogen, which allows water-soluble salts and well-tolerated aqueous injectable solutions to be prepared; its stability to hydrolytic degradation; its rapid metabolic inactivation, which is mainly determined by the methyl group on the imidazole ring, and which is much faster than that of classical benzodiazepines.", 
    "28": "This study evaluated laboratory sleep and performance after placebo, after 5, 10 and 20 mg of midazolam and after 30 mg of flurazepam. EEG recordings showed that 20 mg of midazolam significantly decreased sleep latency and stage 1 sleep, increased stage 2 sleep, and delayed the onset of the first REM period when compared with placebo. Subjective reports from the patients showed that the dose decreased the frequency of awakenings. In the morning, 9 h after drug ingestion, performance on most tests was affected very little by 20 mg of midazolam. However, performance on two psychomotor tests was slightly impaired after 20 mg of midazolam, while a test of free recall was slightly improved. On most variables, 5 mg of midazolam acted like placebo, while 10 mg of midazolam was intermediate between placebo and 20 mg of midazolam. Preliminary data suggest that 20 mg of midazolam may be as efficacious in inducing sleep as 30 mg of flurazepam, but may show fewer performance decrements in the morning.", 
    "29": "We studied in a sleep laboratory the effects of bedtime 15 mg midazolam and 20 mg midazolam on the sleep and morning performance of healthy subjects with polygraphically verified sleep onset insomnia. Six subjects received 15 mg midazolam and six subjects received 20 mg midazolam for 14 consecutive nights which were preceded by a three-night placebo baseline and followed by a three-night placebo period. The medications were administered in a double-blind manner. The results were that both doses increased total sleep time, reduced sleep latency, reduced wake time after sleep onset and reduced the number of awakenings. There was no difference between the doses. Midazolam had its main effect by decreasing wake time in the first third of the night. We found no evidence of tolerance, drug withdrawal rebound insomnia, or drug-induced morning performance decrements. We did find evidence of an anterograde amnesia produced by the drug.", 
    "30": "The effects of a single dose of 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum), 15 mg, on both self-evaluated and all-night EEG-recorded sleep parameters were studied in 10 normal young volunteers. All self-evaluated parameters were modified under midazolam compared with placebo: the sleep onset latency was estimated to be shorter, the sleep duration longer, the sleep quality better. Furthermore, the feeling on awakening in the morning was rated better after midazolam. Yet, when compared with prestudy values, two of these parameters (sleep onset latency and sleep duration) were altered under placebo, despite an adaptation night, but unchanged under midazolam. All-night recordings showed a decrease in intra-sleep awakenings, an increase in stage II and III-IV and a decrease in stage I, mainly during the first sleep cycle whereas REM-sleep was not modified. No sleep latency was significantly modified. The correspondence between self-evaluated and measured sleep-duration was different under placebo and under midazolam, suggesting that an additional effect of the drug might be to modify the subjects' perception of their own sleep.", 
    "31": "Parameters of catecholamine and acetylcholine metabolism were investigated in 55 patients with Huntington's chorea. Heterogeneous nature of the results obtained by examining excretion of catecholamines, their precursors, and metabolites appears to reflect varying degrees of the damage to the cerebral neurotransmitter systems and their imbalance in different patients. It is suggested that the level of catecholamine metabolism in the body is genetically determined. A decrease in the homovanillic acid in the ventricular fluid is attributed to a low pool of dopamine in atrophied basal ganglia and/or hydrocephalus concomitant with Huntington's chorea. The activity of the blood cholinergic system was shown to be decreased, which suggests a generalized nature of acetylcholine metabolism disorder. The data obtained indicate that the biochemical mechanisms of the pathogenesis of Huntington's chorea are intricate in their nature and involve different neurotransmitter systems, which explains insufficient efficacy of the current conclusive methods used for controlling this disease. The development of multiple modality treatment affecting various sides of impaired metabolism of neurotransmitters seems to be promising.", 
    "32": "Residual and acute effects of flurazepam and triazolam were studied in two double-blind, crossover, placebo controlled, single-dose experiments. Psychological and physiological effects were determined 10 h after night administration (flurazepam 30 mg and triazolam 0.5 mg), and for 6 h after morning ingestion (flurazepam 15 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg). Both drugs produced similar \"hangover\" effects, impairing motor performance and increasing sleepiness on the following morning. After morning administration pronounced sedative effects were found with triazolam, while flurazepam effects were mild and hard to distinguish from placebo. The clinical relevance of these findings is discussed, suggesting that these drugs may be conceived as belonging to two different types of hypnotic agents.", 
    "33": "The theta activity which appears in the frontal midline area during performance of mental tasks has been designated as \"Fm theta\". In the present study, the possible use of zopiclone as an anxiolytic agent was investigated using Fm theta, in a comparison with diazepam. Sixteen male university students were given placebo, diazepam 5 mg, zopiclone 5 mg and 10 mg, in a double-blind, cross-over design. EEGs were recorded before and during performance of an arithmetic addition test. This test was repeated twice, prior to and 1 h following drug administration. Diazepam markedly increased Fm theta; however, both zopiclone 10 mg and placebo only slightly affected Fm theta, while zopiclone 5 mg failed to affect Fm theta. Scores of state anxiety were reduced markedly by diazepam and only slightly by zopiclone 10 mg, but were not affected by either zopiclone 5 mg or by placebo. Task performance was reduced markedly and in a dose-dependent manner by zopiclone, and very slightly by diazepam. These results suggest that zopiclone possesses a rather potent hypnotic effect, rather than an anxiolytic effect, and that Fm theta might be a useful tool in predicting the clinical efficacy of anxiolytic drugs in normal humans.", 
    "34": "The anxiolytic effects of alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, were evaluated in a double-blind 28-day comparison with diazepam and placebo in 46 out-patients suffering from anxiety states of moderate to severe intensity. Alprazolam 1.5-3 mg per day was found to be of at least equivalent anxiolytic effect to 15-30 mg diazepam per day, and there was evidence of antidepressant activity by alprazolam, but not diazepam, in neurotic depression. Side-effects occurred least often with alprazolam and were minor in nature. Laboratory data showed no changes attributable to alprazolam even in a patient who swallowed 15 capsules (7.5 mg). It was concluded that alprazolam is a safe and effective anxiolytic which is well-tolerated and also shows some antidepressant activity.", 
    "35": "Sixteen new heterocyclic 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives (compounds AN8-AN24) were screened for their central action. Compounds AN8-AN10 and AN17 strongly antagonized the action of pentetrazol, compounds AN10, AN14-AN17 and AN22 had potent antiserotonin properties, and compounds AN10, AN19, AN20 and AN23 markedly potentiated the action of DOPA.", 
    "36": "The present investigation assessed 45 anxious neurotic adult patients treated double-blindly in three randomized drug groups; bromazepam, diazepam and placebo. Non-signal, simple and complex signal stimuli were presented to monitor electrodermal activity changes at baseline, 4 h, 1 week and 14 days of treatment. The results indicate that patients with generalized anxiety disorder treated with bromazepam developed decreased skin conductance during the presentation of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli presentations. Such skin conductance changes were not significant for patients on diazepam and placebo. Future clinical and research implications of these perceptual and psychophysiological results are discussed in conjunction with the usage of a functional-realistic-instrumental paradigm rather than studying anxiety on an attentional-arousal continuum.", 
    "37": "Due to the increasing pressure to investigate new drugs under conditions met with in practice, Lormetazepam (0.5 mg) was investigated in nine general practices under the direction and collaboration of a psychiatrist used to investigations with psychopharmaceuticals. The results of a double-blind study, carried out in comparison to triazolam (0.5 mg), in a total of 94 ambulatory patients are presented.", 
    "38": "Forty patients with primary chronic alcoholism took part in a randomized, double-blind, comparative group study of clobazam and chlordiazepoxide in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. Assessments were carried out during an initial in-patient week followed by a week of out-patient assessments. Both benzodiazepines were shown to be highly effective when compared with baseline measurements. However, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale showed clobazam to be more effective than chlordiazepoxide at both 7 days (p = 0.03) and 14 days (p less than 0.05). The clobazam group showed significant improvements compared with baseline for all four factors of the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, whereas the chlordiazepoxide group showed a significant improvement in only one factor. At the end of the in-patient week, clobazam showed a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) compared to chlordiazepoxide for the Linear Analogue Rating Scale of anxiety/tension. The 1,5 benzodiazepine clobazam has been shown to be a valuable addition to currently available regimens when used alone in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal, especially during the initial period where anxiety and insomnia related symptoms are at their peak.", 
    "39": "Serum triazolam levels were determined in eight geriatric patients (average age 80 years) on Days 1 and 7 of administration of triazolam 0.25 mg once daily, 1 h after a standard breakfast. Triazolam was rapidly absorbed reaching average peak concentrations of 2.0 and 2.04 ng/ml, 1.5 and 1.38 h after administration on Days 1 and 7, respectively. The mean apparent elimination half-life was 1.41 h (range 0.73-4.13 h) on Day 1 and 1.37 h (range 0.69-3.36 h) on Day 7. There was no significant difference between mean serum triazolam concentrations or pharmacokinetic parameters on Days 1 and 7 of the treatment. Serum samples were also assayed for alpha-hydroxytriazolam, an active metabolite of triazolam, but none could be detected in any of the samples from Days 1 or 7, assay sensitivity 0.09 ng/2 ml serum. The range of half-lives of triazolam in the patients in the present study is in close agreement with that previously reported in elderly subjects. The study provides further evidence of the lack of change in pharmacokinetic parameters on multiple dosing and that drug accumulation did not occur.", 
    "40": "Lormetazepam in a dose range 0.5-2.0 mg was given on a repeated dose regimen to a group of 12 healthy female volunteers in a double blind crossover design with each subject acting as her own control and receiving all 3 drug treatment conditions. There were no consistent or persistent effects noticed with 0.5 mg lormetazepam on tests of psychomotor function, performance and analogue rating scales for sleep and early morning behaviour. Lormetazepam 1 mg produced no significant effects on objective (CFF) or subjective measures (ARS) of sedation the morning following either acute or repeated dosing and had no effects on subjective ratings of sleep and early morning behaviour. Digit symbol substitution was impaired following acute doses of lormetazepam 1 mg. Evidence of a significant residual sedative effect was found on CFF and ARS ratings only after acute dosing with lormetazepam 2 mg. These sedative sequelae were not found after repeated doses of lormetazepam 2 mg although DSST scores were impaired. Lormetazepam 2 mg significantly improved sleep induction and sleep quality scores without impairing the ease of waking and the integrity of early morning behaviour. Lormetazepam 1 mg shows no residual sedative effect as measured by CFF and ARS, the morning following either acute or repeated doses.", 
    "41": "The influence of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam and triazolam, two triazolobenzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic microsomal oxidation, was evaluated in a series of healthy volunteers. Subjects ingested single 1.0 mg dose of alprazolam or 0.5 mg doses of triazolam on two occasions, with and without concurrent administration of cimetidine (300 mg) every 6 h. For alprazolam, which has a low hepatic clearance and low extraction ratio, cimetidine significantly impaired total metabolic clearance (1.05 versus 1.66 ml/min/kg, P less than 0.005), resulting in significantly prolonged elimination half-life (16.6 versus 12.4 h, P less than 0.005). For triazolam, which has higher hepatic clearance and an intermediate extraction ratio, total clearance was reduced by cimetidine (3.9 versus 5.9 ml/min/kg), causing a significant increase in total area under the plasma concentration curve (25 versus 38 ng/ml X h, P less than 0.02). However, elimination half-life of triazolam was not influenced by cimetidine (3.3 versus 3.2 h), indicating that the reduction in clearance was manifested as increased systemic availability. Thus, cimetidine impairs the clearance of both alprazolam and triazolam, but the consequences of the kinetic change are different because of the differing hepatic extraction profiles of the two drugs.", 
    "42": "Dichlorazepate (DPC) was given to eight healthy volunteers aged 22-38 years (five males and three females). The dose was 20 mg (48.9 mumol) given either as an IV or an IM injection. The interval between the injections was at least 1 week. Plasma samples were analysed for desmethyldiazepam (DMD) by HPLC before and after acid hydrolysis. The kinetics after both IV and IM administration could be explained by a one or two compartment open model. By comparing values before and after hydrolysis an estimate of di- and/or monopotassiumchlorazepate (MPC) could be made. The bioavailability was almost 100% after IM administration. The plasma half lives of DPC and DMD were independent of the form of administration (2.42 and 46.0 h respectively after IV and 2.29 and 45.1 h respectively after IM injection).", 
    "43": "The scalp distribution of the quantitative EEG effects of neuroactive compounds was studied in a number of pharmaco-EEG investigations, in which comparable procedures for EEG recording and processing were applied: power spectral and amplitude analyses were combined in all studies. Topographic differentiations were observed. These could include intrahemispheric and/or interhemispheric dissimilarities in the distribution of EEG effects common to the explored electrode derivations, as well as drug effects detectable only in distinct areas. The distribution could vary depending upon the EEG parameter considered; it was restricted to drug-related EEG modifications in all cases.", 
    "44": "A double-blind, daytime, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 12 healthy volunteers to investigate the effects of single doses of 5, 15 and 30 mg temazepam and of 5 and 10 mg nitrazepam on the EEG, psychomotor performance, subjective mental and emotional status, blood pressure and heart rate. Each subject received all 6 treatments in a random sequence at intervals of 1 week. The EEG tracings were evaluated quantitatively by spectral analysis. Psychomotor performance was assessed by means of the tapping test. Subjective mental and emotional status were assessed using the Bond and Lader analogue self-rating scale. Procedures were carried out before and at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 h after drug administration, with the exception of the tapping test, which was carried out before and, again, after 2 and 7 h. EEG estimates of equipotency, based on magnitude of peak effect, were as follows: 15 mg temazepam approximately 5 mg nitrazepam; and 30 mg temazepam greater than or equal to 10 mg nitrazepam. At these approximately equipotent doses, temazepam had a somewhat earlier onset of action on the EEG, a clearly shorter duration of EEG action, and lesser impairment of psychomotor performance than nitrazepam. Qualitatively, both drugs had similar effects on the subjective mental and emotional states of the subjects. There were no clinically relevant changes in mean or individual sitting and standing blood pressure values. After temazepam, but not after nitrazepam, heart rate increased (maximal mean change 10 bpm) as part of a normal startle response to arousal. The results suggest that temazepam has less hangover potential than nitrazepam.", 
    "45": "Trial by media can never take the place of careful scientific evaluation of a psychotropic drug. The two methods are antithetical. Scientific inquiry depends on careful examination of data. The media cannot present information in detail. It titilates, dramatizes and pulls facts out of context. It is unfortunate, but it is so.", 
    "46": "As a preanesthetic medication, lorazepam is available for oral, intravenous, or intramuscular administration. A parenteral dose of 0.04 to 0.06 mg per kg has been shown to be most effective as a preanesthetic medication in terms of antianxiety and antirecall effect (Table 1). Lorazepam has as its predominant advantage over other benzodiazepines the ability to produce anterograde amnesia reliably and for a relatively long duration. From an anesthesia standpoint, the drug finds its major usage as a premedicant or adjuvant (administered in the peri-induction period) to minimize the possibility of recall of unpleasant events during anesthesia and surgery. This is especially germane in patients who are unable to tolerate a sufficient depth of anesthesia to provide this amnesic effect on the basis of anesthetic agent alone. Quite often these patients are critically ill, and from a physiologic standpoint, their cardiovascular systems are unable to tolerate or adapt to moderate to deep anesthetic concentrations of the inhalation anesthetic agents. Even though the metabolic products of lorazepam are not active, the duration of action of this drug dictates that it not be used in the outpatient setting. Indeed, the drug probably should not be used in patients whose expected hospital stay is less than 72 hours. It appears that thrombosis or phlebitis after intravenous injection of lorazepam is less than with diazepam, especially if the drug is injected in small hand or arm veins. Most side effects of lorazepam are associated with central nervous system depression, are dose-related, and fairly predictable. Adverse central nervous system effects may be reversed by administration of physostigmine, but it is worthwhile to note that the duration of action of physostigmine, and repeated administration of physostigmine may be necessary. Lorazepam appears to be acceptable to both physicians and patients. There do not appear to be any obvious adverse interactions between lorazepam and other medications commonly used in anesthesia practice. Nevertheless, it appears that the major value of lorazepam to the anesthesiologist's armamentarium is its ability to prevent recall in appropriate situations.", 
    "47": "In vivo binding of a benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam-C11) and a benzodiazepine antagonist (Ro 15-1788-C11) were studied with positron emission tomography. Advantages and disadvantages of each drug for studying specific in vivo binding sites are presented. The results obtained indicate that Ro 15-1788-C11 is a better in vivo radiocoordinat than flunitrazepam-C11.", 
    "48": "In this work is pointed to the usage of reaction chromatography, i. e. the direct formation of defined compounds of benzodiazepine on the chromatographic plate. The benzodiazepines may be converted to benzophenone derivatives by treatment with concentr. hydrochloric acid. In cases of intoxication the reaction chromatography shortens the time of analysis and it has a greater diagnostic value. For some compounds, however, the micropreparation procedure on the chromatographic plate is preferable. The latter method is suitable for nitroderivatives which are transformed to 7-amino-derivates, occurring also as metabolites. Micropreparation involves the reduction of nitroderivatives by TiCl3.", 
    "49": "Sleep laboratory hypnotic medication trials typically determine efficacy by examining changes in polysomnographically recorded sleep. We introduce the use of daytime sleepiness, as assessed by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), as a criterion for daytime functioning in such trials. Two benzodiazepine hypnotics, triazolam (0.5 mg) and flurazepam (30 mg), with short and long half-lives respectively, were compared in a multicentered, double-blind crossover study. Results indicated these medications had virtually indistinguishable nocturnal effects, but differed dramatically during the day. Flurazepam decreased sleep latency on the MSLT, whereas triazolam did not. These results could indicate that daytime sleepiness is a concomitant effect of flurazepam.", 
    "50": "Male Wistar rats were trained to press a lever with food reinforcement according to a continuously reinforced schedule (CRF). Afterwards, rats were subjected to three experimental sessions (30 min each) during which responding was rewarded according to a progressive ratio schedule (following an initial 2-min CRF period, the number of presses necessary for the pellet delivery was doubled every second minute). Responding during the first half of each session, i.e., pressing for food, was maintained at a significant level, whereas it was almost suppressed during the second part of the session. As compared to controls (200 +/- 20 presses/30 min) animals given amfonelic acid (0.5, 1 mg/kg IP), methylphenidate (4, 8 mg/kg IP), caffeine (16 mg/kg IP), cocaine (4 mg/kg IP), oxolinic acid (32 mg/kg IP), nomifensine (4 mg/kg IP), DR 250 (2, 4 mg/kg IP) and d-amphetamine (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg IP) showed an increased rate of responding ranging from 400 to 950 presses/30 min. In contrast, apomorphine, MK 486 + L-dopa, trihexyphenidyl, imipramine, salbutamol and diazepam did not increase responding. These results suggested that this test is highly sensitive for psychomotor stimulants and perhaps for their ability to enhance the reinforcing value of the reward or stimuli associated with the reward. Such activity seemed related to a catecholaminergic substrate since the increase of responding induced by amphetamine was blocked by pimozide, d,l-propranolol and prazosin.", 
    "51": "Studies of the regional distribution of proteins irreversibly labeled by 3H-flunitrazepam indicate that the contribution of the individual proteins to total irreversible binding of 3H-flunitrazepam was different in different brain regions and varied independently from each other. Study of the inhibition by Cl 218 872 of 3H-flunitrazepam binding to the individual benzodiazepine binding proteins in cerebellum and hippocampus revealed that inhibition by Cl 218 872 of total irreversible binding of 3H-flunitrazepam to proteins was closely similar to that of reversible binding to membranes. However, when inhibition by Cl 218 872 of 3H-flunitrazepam binding to individual benzodiazepine binding proteins was measured, it was found that this substance had different affinity for the various individual proteins. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that the protein P51 is associated with the BZ1-benzodiazepine receptor subtype and that the individual proteins irreversibly labeled by 3H-flunitrazepam are independent from each other and associated with different benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "52": "Microvessels from pig brain areas were prepared by differential centrifugation techniques. These fractions were assayed for purity and structural unity by marker enzyme determination, light and electron microscopy. Binding properties of 3H-flunitrazepam were studied in different brain regions. Kinetic studies of 3H-flunitrazepam showed BMax-values of 0,42 +/- 0,3 pmol/mg protein and KD-values of 1,26 +/- 0,6 nM and were compared to a synaptosomal membrane fraction (P2-fraction) with BMax = 2,68 +/- 0,5 pmol/mg protein and a KD of 1,95 +/- 0,3 nM. GABA kinetic studies gave IC50-values of 250 nM in the microvessel fraction and 40 nM in the P2-fraction.", 
    "53": "The discovery that two or more neuroactive substances coexist in the same nerve terminal suggests that two or more neuroactive compounds can be released by nerve impulses simultaneously and probably act cooperatively at postsynaptic sites. This interaction changes the models of synaptic transmission we have used in the past and imposes a reevaluation of current understanding of synaptic pharmacology. Neuroactive substances co-existing in the same axon terminal can function as \"primary transmitter\" if they activate the receptor-transducer system or as \"cotransmitter\" if they modulate the gain of the system. Two examples of synaptic mechanisms in which two neuroactive substances coexisting in the same axon terminal appear to function as primary transmitter and cotransmitter are discussed. These examples are: 1. the modulation of the function of nicotinic receptors of chromaffin cells by endogenous opiate peptides stored in the splanchnic nerve and 2. the modulation of GABA receptor function by benzodiazepines. The understanding of the mechanisms by which primary transmitter and cotransmitter interact at the postsynaptic site may be of obvious importance in elucidating the integrative and discriminative function of the nervous system, in interpreting the action of drugs and in developing new therapeutic agents devoid of untoward side effects.", 
    "54": "In a double-blind clinical trial, 50 psychiatric outpatients with moderate insomnia (requiring daily treatment with a hypnotic drug) were treated for two weeks with lormetazepam (1 mg) or amobarbital sodium (100 mg). In interviews before and after treatment, data were collected on the patients' demographic characteristics, sleep disturbances, concomitant organic or psychiatric disorders, and opinions of the drug taken during the two-week period. During the trial the patients took notes on their use of the drug, the quality and duration of their sleep, and any adverse effects of the drug they were using. Lormetazepam and amobarbital were equivalent in the amount of time it took patients receiving each drug to fall asleep and in the duration of the patients' sleep, but insomnia disappeared (or the condition improved) in a larger proportion of patients receiving lormetazepam, and there were fewer adverse effects (eg, hangover in the morning, sedation in the morning and during the day, and dry mouth) in patients receiving lormetazepam than in patients receiving amobarbital.", 
    "55": "Animal studies have led to the hypothesis that GP 55 129 sedates less than diazepam while possessing the same anxiolytic qualities. This hypothesis was tested on 60 healthy, emotionally labile volunteers. The drugs were administered once in a double-blind test at a dosage of 10 mg diazepam and 4 mg GP 55 129. A video camera and very difficult tests were used to induce anxiety in the subjects. Multivariate analysis of the 15 factors in the adjective check list showed a global drug effect (P less than 0.025). Comparison of the profiles of mean values indicated that the subjects under diazepam felt more tired and groggy than those with GP 55 129 and placebo medication at the dosage level used. However, the individual comparisons were not statistically significant. There was a significant reduction for both drugs in relation to the placebo in the \"excitation\" factor of the polarity profile. Free description showed a typical tranquilizer profile for both drugs. Significant achievement decrements (concentration-performance test by D\u00fcker, Viennese determination instrument, pursuit rotor, critical flicker fusion frequency) were not evident for either drug after a single dose of the strength we were examining. Subjective verbal tests yielded some significant sex differences without showing any interaction between sex and drug. To summarize the results, it can be said that the new substance possesses tranquilizing effects marked by a general suppression of excitation. The profile differences on the adjective check list showed a trend toward confirmation of the hypothesis, but must be replicated in further tests.", 
    "56": "Over a decade of research since the publication of Human Sexual Inadequacy by Masters and Johnson has confirmed the effectiveness of psychological treatment for sexual problems, but has not advanced our understanding of aetiology very much. It is generally assumed that anxiety blocks normal function in sexual disorders such as impotence or frigidity, although hormonal changes have also been suggested. Evidence for either proposition is lacking. Our own attempts to understand mechanisms have included the use of a dismantling strategy to investigate the effective components of psychological treatment, and latterly the role of exogenous androgens. In our first study, brief treatment modelled on that of Masters and Johnson proved superior to another version of graded practice in sexual contact which lacked the counselling component. Similarly, the fuller version had more effect than did imaginal desensitization, suggesting that sexual dysfunctions cannot be treated like phobic anxiety. A second study focused on women complaining of little sexual interest or enjoyment. The use of a minor tranquillizer was compared with that of androgen (testoral) in the hope that different treatments would be shown to be best for different types of disorder. Unexpectedly, the androgen proved best overall while another variable, monthly vs weekly sessions, did not produce any differences in effect. In the most recent study, a further 48 women were given androgens or placebo, and were seen weekly or monthly for four months by either one or two therapists. There were few significant differences, the most consistent being greater subjective improvement by the women being seen at weekly intervals. The failure to find a positive hormone effect in comparison with placebo raises the possibility that the anxiolytic used earlier may have been counter-productive. If so, it seems unlikely that either excessive anxiety or simple androgen deficiency is an adequate aetiological explanation for female sexual dysfunction.", 
    "57": "Two doses of buspirone (5 and 10 mg tds), 1 dose of diazepam (5 mg tds) and placebo were administered to 8 normal subjects for a period of 8 days. Each subject received each drug in a balanced order with a minimum interval of 1 week between courses. Psychotropic effects were assessed with a battery of physiological, psychomotor and subjective tests on the first, third and last days of treatment both before the first daily dose and at 1 h and 3 h after it. Diazepam showed a characteristic profile of action producing EEG changes and psychological impairment after a single dose which were still present after a week's treatment. Such effects were minimal after buspirone. Both drugs increased subjective ratings of drowsiness but these feelings tended to decrease after a week's treatment on the clinical doses. Buspirone (10 mg tds) produced some unpleasant side-effects initially but tolerance to these invariably developed after 3 days treatment.", 
    "58": "One hundred patients undergoing routine fibreoptic bronchoscopy were randomly allocated to receive premedication with either intramuscular papaveretum or oral temazepam in a double-blind manner. They all received atropine before and oxygen during the procedure. Patients found the drugs equally acceptable in terms of discomfort, anxiety and the possibility of repeat bronchoscopy, but more had recall of the procedure with papaveretum. There was no difference in secretions, coughing, relaxation and consciousness, as assessed by the bronchoscopist, but patients who had received papaveretum were more cooperative. Arterial blood gases were performed before and 45 minutes after bronchoscopy. Those given papaveretum had a significant fall in mean arterial oxygen tension of 0.96 kPa, while there was no significant change in the temazepam group. There was also a small mean rise in arterial carbon dioxide tension in both groups, with the mean rise in the papaveretum group (0.625 kPa) being significantly higher than the temazepam group (0.2 kPa). Premedication with temazepam is a useful alternative to papaveretum and has the advantage of oral administration and causing less respiratory depression.", 
    "59": "The capacities of the resins Wofatit Y 29, Y 55 and Y 56 (VEB Chemiekombinat Bitterfeld) to adsorb various medicaments were compared with that of the resin XAD-4. Methaquelone, diazepam, krotylbarbital, promazine phosphate and ethyloxamine were used as test substances. The resin Y 56 proved to have an adsorption capacity similar to that of XAD-4 (e.g. maximum saturation for methaquelone 98%, half-maximum saturation at 7 minutes). In further tests on various batches of this resin the best results were given by the resin Y 56/7. Adsorption was quite clearly shown to be dependent on concentration. At a blood-flow of 100 ml/min clearance values of 34.5 ml/min for krotylbarbitol and 22.1 ml/min for methaquelone were calculated. According to these findings the resin Y 56/7 is suitable for further testing in a haemoperfusion system with a view to clinical use.", 
    "60": "The benzodiazepines have been considered largely free of neuro-endocrine effect. However, in a double-blind, random assignment, placebo controlled study of six young women in the first half of their menstrual cycle oral temazepam (20 mg) was found to significantly lower plasma cortisol and raise plasma prolactin. The impact on cortisol was significant at 40 min and persisted for 3 h (P less than 0.01) after oral ingestion. Prolactin was significantly raised at 1 h after ingestion only (P less than 0.05). No impact on FSH or LH was noted. These findings are compatible with recent reports of gamma-aminobutyric acid and benzodiazepine binding sites in human pituitary tissue. The positive and negative aspects of these findings for the clinician are discussed. This research has important implications for biological studies such as the dexamethasone suppression test, since the patients involved are commonly allowed benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "61": "Before the introduction of lorazepam injection to the Canadian market, its usefulness and acceptability were assessed in an open multicenter study. Anesthesiologists in teaching hospitals across the country were asked to substitute lorazepam injection for their usual anxiolytic premedicant in ten patients and to complete a brief case report on each patient. The results from 360 patients showed that suitable preoperative sedation, accompanied by anxiolysis but without undue effects on arousability, was obtained in 88% of the patients prior to surgery. The adverse effect most often reported, accounting for 84% of the drug-related adverse reactions, was postoperative drowsiness, which highlighted the need to administer the drug at least two hours before surgery. The anesthesiologists found lorazepam injection to be a satisfactory premedicant, rating it excellent to good in 73% of the patients treated.", 
    "62": "The present experiment was undertaken to assess the ways in which benzodiazepine administration alters heart rate responding during Pavlovian aversive conditioning in the rabbit. Each of three benzodiazepine compounds (chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam, diazepam) reliably attenuated the magnitude of the conditioned bradycardia response as compared to vehicle controls. Lower doses of two of these compounds significantly potentiated the conditioned bradycardia response. Benzodiazepine treatment did not significantly alter baseline heart rate, the expression and habituation of the heart rate orienting response, or heart rate responding during unpaired stimulus presentations. The effects of benzodiazepines under these conditions therefore appeared to be selective to those heart rate responses that were conditioned. These results are consistent with evidence suggesting the involvement of benzodiazepine-sensitive processes in the expression of emotional responses, including concomitant cardiovascular alterations.", 
    "63": "The effects of various antidepressant drugs and some other therapeutic agents on the depression of locomotion and exploratory activity induced by clonidine (0.1 mg/kg IP) were investigated in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unquiculatus). In parallel experiments, the effect of yohimbine on clonidine-induced sedation was observed. The following behavioral components were analysed: ambulation, rearing and novel object investigation. Yohimbine antagonized the effects of clonidine in a dose-dependent manner. All antidepressants similarly antagonized the effect of clonidine on ambulation but they differed to a greater extent in their potency in counteracting the clonidine action on exploration, particularly the novel object investigation. On the other hand diazepam and neuroleptic agents such as pimozide and flupentixol failed to antagonize the clonidine effects. The antagonism of clonidine-induced behavioral depression might be used in the selection of antidepressants."
