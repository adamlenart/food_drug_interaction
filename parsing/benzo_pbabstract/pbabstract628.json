    "0": "1. Methods were devised and evaluated for inducing breathlessness by submaximal graded exercise in healthy subjects while objective measurements of cardiorespiratory function were made. Breathlessness was assessed with serial visual analogue scales (VAS), but with various measures to enhance repeatability. 2. A high level of reproducibility was obtained in spite of the subjective nature of the assessment. Individual responses were described by the relationship between breathlessness and ventilation. The sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by the use of inspiratory resistances which disturbed this relationship and caused greater breathlessness for a given level of ventilation. 3. These methods were applied to six healthy subjects to analyse the effects of acute doses of diazepam and promethazine on breathlessness induced by graded exercise or by rebreathing carbon dioxide in a double-blind study. 4. During exercise, diazepam and promethazine did not reduce breathlessness, although there was a minor trend with promethazine. During exposure to elevated levels of carbon dioxide, diazepam and promethazine had no effect on breathlessness. Diazepam and promethazine produced similar levels of sedation, but neither drug had significant effects on the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. These preliminary findings contrast with those reported for chronic diazepam in 'pink puffers'. 5. Raised levels of carbon dioxide caused greater breathlessness in relation to ventilation than did exercise.", 
    "1": "Pooled human cerebrospinal fluid was separated by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. The presence of three peaks, A, B and C, was demonstrated by monitoring absorbance at 254 and 280 nm. All peaks showed [3H]diazepam displacing activity in the membrane receptor test. Peak B was further separated on Bio-Gel P-4. At least two major fractions free of salt and GABA in the molecular weight range of approximately 700--3600 were shown to displace [3H]diazepam in the receptor test. This activity was enhanced by a factor of 3 in the presence of 10 microM-GABA.", 
    "2": "Procarbazine, a non-benzodiazepine tranquilizer and anti-convulsant, significantly decreased the binding of [3H]diazepam to mouse cerebellar membranes. The drug treatment reduced both the affinity and density of the receptor. The effect, however, was more pronounced on the number of binding sites suggesting occupation of the receptor by procarbazine. The results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors may also be involved in the pharmacological action of non-benzodiazepine drugs.", 
    "3": "The antiepileptic effect of clorazepate when given with phenytoin was compared, in a randomized double-blind crossover study, to the effect of the standard regimen of phenobarbital plus phenytoin in patients with partial seizures. Thirty of 42 subjects preferred the clorazepate-phenytoin regimen (p less than 0.01). The same number of subjects had fewer seizures while taking clorazepate as had fewer seizures while taking phenobarbital. However, subjects had significantly more toxicity, objective and subjective, on the phenobarbital-phenytoin regimen (p less than 0.01 in both cases). In some subjects, increased toxicity due to phenobarbital outweighed better seizure control, so that clorazepate was preferred. As an add-on antiepileptic drug, clorazepate is well tolerated, effective, and preferred by most patients to phenobarbital.", 
    "4": "The oral acute toxicity of 3 beta-adrenoceptor stimulants, 2 beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and 2 anti-gastric ulcer drugs was studied in 8-week old, SD-JCL rats and ICR-JCL mice, fasted overnight for 17-20 hours. The results were compared with those from rats and mice allowed to feed normally. The order of the fed:fasted ratio of LD50 values in rats was pirenzepin less than propantheline less than pindolol less than salbutamol less than orciprenaline less than fenoterol less than bunitrolol, and was in the range 1.3-4.7. The increased toxicity in fasted animals was considered to be related to acceleration in gastric emptying and intestinal absorption, but not to a general change in the condition of the test system or a decrease in the detoxification ability of the liver because after intraperitoneal administration acute toxicity was similar in fed and fasted rats.", 
    "5": "Alcohol and flunitrazepam did not have any pharmacokinetic interactions when ingested 30 minutes apart at night. Flunitrazepam, 2.0 mg, but not 0.8 Gm/kg alcohol had a strong deleterious effect on performance shortly after ingestion. The combination of flunitrazepam and alcohol impaired tracking in a divided attention task the following morning.", 
    "6": "In a study of white adults from 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics populations, plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in benzodiazepine (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam) users were compared to both the entire population of non-users and matched control non-users. Significantly higher plasma triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and by one method of analysis, lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were noted in male benzodiazepine users. No significant differences were noted in total plasma cholesterol or low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.", 
    "7": "Thirty-two male and female volunteers, 24-84 years of age, ingested single 30-mg doses of temazepam, a 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepine derivative used as a hypnotic agent. Kinetics of total and unbound temazepam were determined from multiple plasma temazepam concentrations measured during 48 hr after the dose. The temazepam elimination half-life ranged from 8 to 38 hr and was longer in women than in men (16.8 versus 12.3 hr, p less than 0.05). Likewise, clearance of total temazepam (assuming complete absorption) was higher in men than in women (1.35 versus 1.02 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.025). Neither half-life nor clearance was significantly related to age. The volume of distribution of total temazepam (mean 1.40 liters/kg) was unrelated to age or gender. Temazepam was extensively protein bound, with a mean free fraction of 2.6% (range 12.7-3.4%). The free fraction increased with age (r = 0.45, p = 0.01), partly due to the inverse relation of the free fraction to plasma albumin concentration (r = -0.34, p = 0.06) and the age-related decline in plasma albumin (r = -0.49, p less than 0.005). After correction for individual differences in binding, clearance of unbound temazepam in men was higher than in women (50.5 versus 39.7 ml/min/kg, 0.05 less than p less than 0.01), and it tended to decline with age in both sexes (r = -0.44 and -0.43, respectively, p = 0.1).", 
    "8": "1 An investigation has been made of the excretion of alpha-methyldopa, alpha-methyldopa sulphate, lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide in the urine of neonates. 2 The rate of elimination of both the drugs in the newborn is slow compared with the adult rate, and apparent half-life being 3 to 4 times longer than the reported adult values. 3 The newborn appear able to readily metabolise alpha-methyldopa to alpha-methyldopa sulphate and to slowly conjugate lorazepam with glucuronic acid. alpha-Methyldopa tends to be conjugated to a greater extent and lorazepam to about the same or slightly lesser extent in the newborn than in adults. 4 It is postulated that elimination in the neonate is mainly controlled by the rate of renal excretion in the case of alpha-methyldopa and by the rate of conjugation in the case of lorazepam.", 
    "9": "Local venous reactions during and after the injection i.v. of diazepam in oil (Diazemuls) and the water-soluble benzodiazepine midazolam (Dormicum) were studied in 100 patients undergoing gastroscopy. Observation time was 2 weeks. Of the patients receiving diazepam in oil, 8% experienced pain on injection and 6% subsequently developed clinical evidence of thrombophlebitis. Corresponding figures for midazolam were 6% and 10% respectively. No significant differences were observed between the effects of the two drugs.", 
    "10": "Behavioral paradigms that have been designed to mimic forms of learning that are important for the survival of animals in the wild, rather than to minimize the contributions of adaptive predispositions, may prove to be particularly useful for studying the behavioral effects of drugs. In the present experiments, the propensity of rats to bury sources of aversive stimulation was disrupted in a dose-dependent fashion by a single injection of the anxiolytic drug, diazepam. This suggested that the conditioned defensive burying paradigm could prove to be a valuable addition to the paradigms available for studying anxiolytic effects. Supporting this view were two additional observations. First, the relative potencies of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and pentobarbital in the burying paradigm compared favorably with their relative potencies in clinical settings. Second, the effects of anxiolytics on conditioned burying appeared to be dissociable from the effects of other drugs that disrupt this behavior.", 
    "11": "Excessive grooming in response to intracerebroventricular (ICV) ACTH1-24 was assayed following various doses of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam. Grooming scores were only affected by doses of the benzodiazepines higher than those that depressed locomotor activity. Similarly, diazepam did not affect excessive grooming induced by ICV beta-endorphin, nor did chronic chlordiazepoxide affect ACTH-induced grooming. By contrast similar doses of the benzodiazepines decreased the increased grooming score observed when mice were observed in a novel as opposed to the home cage. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that novel cage-induced grooming is caused by an increase in the ventricular content of ACTH or beta-endorphin, and that the benzodiazepines decrease or prevent this increase. It is not consistent with hypotheses of a functional antagonism between ACTH and benzodiazepines, at least insofar as the mechanisms involved in the production of grooming are concerned.", 
    "12": "Anxiolytic drugs including diazepam (DZP), chlordiazepoxide (CDX), pentabarbitol (PB) and ethanol (EtOH) produce specific alterations in the behavior of fasted rats given access to a single food pellet secured in the center of a novel open field environment. These drugs increase the total amount of food eaten in a 15 min test and the mean amount eaten per approach to the food pedestal. This latter effect appears to be the more sensitive index of anxiolytic drug action and occurs at doses which have no effect on rearing or grooming. DZP was effective following either acute or chronic (15 day) treatment at doses which have no effect on the food consumption by fasted rats tested in their home cages. The effects of the sedative benzodiazepine, flurazepam, were similar to those of DZP but were not statistically significant. Behavioral effects similar to those of DZP were seen in animals receiving additional handling prior to testing or in animals habituated to the open field. Neither the anti-psychotic haloperidol nor morphine mimicked the actions of DZP.", 
    "13": "This paper presents the results of acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity studies on ethyl fluclozepate (CM 9612). Acute toxicity was studied in rats and mice of both sexes by oral and intraperitoneal routes. This study established the very low toxicity of this compound. The LD0 by the oral route in these two species is at least higher than 4 g/kg, whereas by the intraperitoneal route the compound has a LD50 of 645 mg/kg at the lowest level. The 3- and 6-month subacute and chronic toxicity studies were carried out in baboons and in rats. The only effects observed during these studies were sedation in the baboon, a slight decrease of the heart rate also in baboons (6 months), and the presence of foam cells in rat lungs after only 6 months of treatment. The sedation and the decrease of heart rate are not toxic effects, but rather the consequence of the anxiolytic activity of CM 6912. Pulmonary foam cells occurred in rats only after a long period of treatment (6 months) and at very high dose levels. This lesion was considered evidence of pulmonary phospholipidosis, a change known to occur frequently with compounds of this nature.", 
    "14": "In the 2 years 1978 and 1979 specimens from 287 children aged between 10 days and 14 years were received for general toxicological investigations. Of the 95 (33%) cases of confirmed poisoning, the diagnosis was established as a direct result of the analyses in 48 patients. No diagnosis was made in at least 85 (30%) of the remaining cases. Benzodiazepines were the drugs most commonly encountered (33%), followed by barbiturates, glutethimide, and meprobamate (15%), salicylate and paracetamol (15%), tricyclic antidepressants (12%), and ethanol (11%). 36 patients were severely poisoned (grade 3 or 4 coma, or convulsions), although only 1 patent died. There was evidence that drug(s) had been administered without authorisation in at least 7 instances, and in 51 (54%) of the poisoned patients there was sufficient concern about the safety of the child or the mode of administration of the drug(s) to institute legal proceedings (8 cases), involve the social services (25 cases), or arrange further medical appointments (18 cases). Drugs are readily available in most households and offer a means of inflicting injury that is less easily detectable than physical assault. For this reason, comprehensive toxicological investigations should be considered in children not only when they may assist in management but also in the presence of unusual or unexplained symptoms which could be drug-induced.", 
    "15": "The function of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), has been implicated in the mode of action of many drugs which excite or depress the central nervous system. Many convulsant agents appear to block GABA action whereas anticonvulsants enhance GABA action. Some of these drug effects involve altered GABA-mediated synaptic transmission at the level of GABA biosynthesis, release from nerve endings, uptake into cells, and metabolic degradation. A greater number of agents of diverse classes appear to affect GABA action at the postsynaptic membrane, as determined from both electrophysiological and biochemical studies. The recently developed in vitro radioactive receptor binding assays have led to a wealth of new information about GABA action and its alteration by drugs. GABA inhibitory transmission involves the regulation, by GABA binding to its receptor site, of chloride ion channels. In this GABA receptor-ionophore system, other drug receptor sites, one for benzodiazepines and one for barbiturates/picrotoxinin (and related agents) appear to form a multicomponent complex. In this complex, the drugs binding to any of the three receptor categories are visualized to have an effect on GABA-associated chloride channel regulation. Available evidence suggests that the complex mediates many of the actions of numerous excitatory and depressant drugs showing a variety of pharmacological effects.", 
    "16": "We monitored benzodiazepine prescribing in a family medicine center for two years. A total of 1,886 prescriptions were written for four benzodiazepines in the following order of frequency: diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, clorazepate. The most frequent diagnostic indications were anxiety neurosis, hysterical neurosis, and vertebral column disorders. Most benzodiazepine recipients were women, but for alcohol abuse more prescriptions were written for men. More than half of the patients were between the ages of 25 and 44 years. Although daily doses were reduced for elderly patients, the course of therapy was often longer. Female physicians wrote fewer prescriptions for men than for women. More prescriptions for benzodiazepines were written during the summer months than during the rest of the year, and more were written on weekdays than on the weekend. Benzodiazepine recipients were given more prescriptions for other drugs than were the rest of the patients in the practice.", 
    "17": "The 1-octanol/water partition coefficients of sets of 1,4-benzodiazepine and phenothiazine derivatives are determined. The values of the hydrophobic parameters obtained by shake-flask procedure are correlated to the corresponding HPLC retention times. The existence of linear correlations between the two experimentally determined parameters clearly show that chromatographic indices model excellently the shake-flask parameters.", 
    "18": "The injection of kainic acid into the substantia nigra causes, 3 weeks after treatment, a 40% decrease in the total number of binding sites for [3H]diazepam with an increase in the dissociation constant. This decrease was restored to approximately normal by the subsequent injection of kainic acid into the striatum, homolateral to the lesioned substantia nigra. The injection of kainic acid into the striatum of intact animals failed to modify the number of [3H]diazepam binding sites but increased the KD. The results indicate that benzodiazepine binding sites in the substantia nigra are partly located on kainic acid sensitive elements (probably interneurons) and, partly, on kainic acid resistant ones. These binding sites become supersensitive after degeneration of striato-nigral pathways. The possible role of GABAergic denervation of the substantia nigra in the development of benzodiazepine binding sites supersensitivity is discussed.", 
    "19": "Daily administration of electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) to rats for 10 days resulted in enhanced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA)-mediated behavioural responses. 5-HT and NA-mediated responses were still enhanced after 21 shock-free days. The three types of behavioural responses were also studied in rats given phenytoin sodium, carbamazepine and diazepam every day, alone, or 1 h after ECS administration. Phenytoin did not alter the ECS-induced enhancement of any of the three behaviours. Carbamazepine and diazepam significantly retarded the enhancement in 5-HT and DA-mediated behaviours, although they did not alter the enhancement in NA-mediated behaviour.", 
    "20": "Long-term, normal-dose benzodiazepine treatment was discontinued in 16 patients who were suspected of being dependent on their medication. The withdrawal was gradual, placebo-controlled, and double-blind. All the patients experienced some form of withdrawal reaction, which ranged from anxiety and dysphoria to moderate affective and perceptual changes. Symptom ratings rose as the drugs were discontinued, but usually subsided to prewithdrawal levels over the next two to four weeks. Other features of the withdrawal included disturbance of sleep and appetite and noticeable weight loss. Electroencephalography showed appreciable reduction in fast-wave activity as the drugs were withdrawn, and an improvement in psychological performance was recorded by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Because of the risk of dependence on benzodiazepines these agents should probably not be given as regular daily treatment for chronic anxiety.", 
    "21": "Methods for quick qualitative and quantitative evaluation of drug intake are needed, especially during emergency situations such as drug overdose and alcohol intoxication. The electronystagmograph was used in an attempt to develop a non-invasive method for identification of drug intake, and to study the effects of alcohol and other drugs on the vestibular system. Results of the study reveal that alcohol, diazepam, opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, marijuana, and hallucinogenic drugs produce a characteristic printout pattern which can be evaluated qualitatively. This method is a practical, non-invasive, objective procedure that provides rapid assessment of quality of drug intake. Its potential uses are extensive, including such possibilities as evaluation of drug intake in emergency drug overdose situations, monitoring anesthesia during surgery, evaluating drug intake in women about to deliver, (as well as the effects on the newborn), and determining whether or not persons who are being tested on a polygraph are under the influence of drugs.", 
    "22": "Barbiturate treatment can enhance drug oxidation in man, but its effects on glucuronidation of clinically used drugs are unknown. We have studied the effect of 10 days treatment with pentobarbital on oxazepam glucuronidation in six volunteers. The diastereomeric (+ and -) glucuronides in urine were analyzed separately by high performance liquid chromatography and oxazepam in plasma by gas liquid chromatography. The area under the plasma concentration time curve for oxazepam (15 mg sod) decreased after pentobarbital treatment in all subjects, mean 10.4 before and 6.9 h X mumol/l after treatment (P less than 0.05) and oxazepam's plasma clearance increased by about 50 per cent. The glucuronides appeared more rapidly in the initial urinary fractions. The ratio between the glucuronides (+/-) appearing in urine decreased on pentobarbital treatment. Our data indicate that pentobarbital treatment increases the clearance of oxazepam by increased glucuronide conjugation, probably reflecting barbiturate induced changes of UDP glucuronyltransferase.", 
    "23": "The efficacy of haemodialysis and controlled sequential ultrafiltration (CSU) for the elimination of three hypnotic and 6 benzodiazepine drugs was compared in vitro. In comparison to haemodialysis the efficacy of ultrafiltration by CSU was poor, as the mean per cent of CSU/haemodialysis (mg/hr) for 5 benzodiazepines was only 0.6-4.0% and for three hypnotics, phenobarbital 3.4%, pyrithyldione 8.2% and glutethimide 2.5% of the haemodialysis values. In haemodialysis in vitro phenobarbital, pyrithyldione, glutethimide and chlordiazepoxide were significantly and markedly more dialysable than 5 other benzodiazepines. The mean clearance of six benzodiazepine derivatives was about 2 to 3 times higher at blood flow rates of 200 ml/min. than 100 ml/min. In CSU experiments in vitro it was possible to remove approximately (as the mean percent of the initial dose) only the amount of five benzodiazepines corresponding to the per cent of the protein unbound fraction in the plasma (correlation r = 0.975, P less than 0.01). Only low amounts of three hypnotics, especially glutethimide, were removed by CSU in vitro.", 
    "24": "A study was conducted to assess the feasibility of substituting diazepam for pentobarbital and phenobarbital in sedative-hypnotic tolerance testing and withdrawal of tolerant patients. Nineteen patients potentially dependent on sedative-hypnotics were tolerance tested with either diazepam or pentobarbital and, if tolerant, were withdrawn with diazepam or phenobarbital, respectively. Seventy-eight subjects previously described in the literature with drug dependencies similar to the diazepam and barbiturate groups provided a basis for comparing the diazepam group to untreated patients to determine whether diazepam was able to prevent abstinence symptoms. Withdrawal was successfully completed in all patients. The expected and observed incidence of seizures, delirium, and minor withdrawal for the barbiturate group and seizures and delirium for the diazepam group did not differ significantly, although a large type II error compromised these conclusions. A significant difference was seen between the observed and expected incidence of minor withdrawal symptoms in the diazepam-withdrawn patients.", 
    "25": "Effects of tofisopam on the gastric ulceration induced by immobilization stress in olfactory-bulbectomized rats, propulsion of the small intestine caused by water immersion-stress in rats and autonomic responses to electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus in rabbits were investigated. Immobilization stress loading of 16.5 hours each for 10 days caused the augmentation of incidence and average index of gastric ulceration in olfactory-bulbectomized rats, compared with non-treated rats. Tofisopam 100 mg/kg, p.o. significantly inhibited the gastric ulceration in olfactory-bulbectomized rats. Water immersion-stress loading for 2 hours caused a significant increase in propulsion of the small intestine in rats. This increase was reversed to control levels after the oral administration of tofisopam in a dose of 100 mg/kg. Tofisopam at dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. inhibited the contraction of ear microvessels, the decrease in earlobe temperature and the mydriasis induced by electrical stimulation of the medial hypothalamic area in rabbits, Moreover, these inhibitions were also shown by the intra-cerebrospinal injection of tofisopam at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. From these results, it is concluded that tofisopam could restore the autonomic abnormality induced by stress-loading and exerts such effects by acting on the hypothalamus, an area of the brain, which regulates autonomic nervous functions.", 
    "26": "The interactions between physostigmine and chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, flurazepam were experimentally evaluated in rats and mice by the following test: loss of righting reflex (LRR), acute toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity and EEG pattern. Physostigmine did not modify the duration of LRR produced by chlordiazepoxide. Conversely, the recovery after diazepam was significantly longer. The LD50 of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were not modified by physostigmine administration, but that of flurazepam was significantly decreased. Heart rate and blood pressure did not change significantly with physostigmine pre-treatment. However, the total lethal dose was lowered for chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam. Only the reversal by physostigmine of the EEG pattern due to benzodiazepines, offers experimental support to the claimed usefulness of physostigmine in benzodiazepine intoxication in humans. Furthermore, the potentiation of flurazepam toxicity must be taken into account in the debate concerning the clinical advantages of physostigmine.", 
    "27": "The present paper reviews the possible utility and limitations of using behavior-modifying drugs to study reciprocal influences in parent-child interactions. Ideal circumstances for use of this approach are outlined and contrasted with the current status of the field of psychopharmacology. Numerous limitations to the approach are found. Yet the utility of the design is demonstrated in several studies of stimulant drug effects on the mother-child interactions of hyperactive children, and in one pilot study of the effects of diazepam, an anxiolytic, on these same interactions. The major pitfalls to this approach will quite likely be overcome by future research and the development of safer, more highly specific behavior-modifying drugs.", 
    "28": "Etiologic analysis used in experiments on isolated mice has shown that each biologically important category of intraspecies behavior (aggression, communicability, etc) is characterized by its own time course of diazepam tolerance. Participation of the GABAergic mechanisms in acute and chronic effects of diazepam was demonstrated to vary. Acute effect of diazepam was dominated by the sedative component whose action was reversed by picrotoxin and bicuculline that activated motor rather than zoosocial activities. In the course of diazepam tolerance induction, picrotoxin and bicuculline counteracted antiaggressive action of diazepam and diazepam-induced activation of intraspecies communicability. However, they did not fully inhibit the communicability.", 
    "29": "The use of ketamine in patients with carcinoid syndrome is controversial because of the catecholamine response to this agent. Prior administration of diazepam modifies the catecholamine response to ketamine and may make its use in such patients safe. The successful use of a diazepam-ketamine technique for anaesthesia of a patient with malignant carcinoid syndrome and associated tricuspid valve disease who underwent laparotomy and hepatic artery ligation is described. The theoretical advantages of safe ketamine anaesthesia in carcinoid patients are discussed and the relevant literature reviewed. To the authors' knowledge the successful use of ketamine anaesthesia in carcinoid syndrome has not previously been reported.", 
    "30": "Midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, was investigated as an intravenous anaesthetic agent in 260 adult patients in doses ranging from 0.15 to 0.5 mg/kg using a variety of premedications. Its onset of action was generally slow, taking up to 3 minutes to exert its maximum effect. A wide variability in response was found in that some unpremedicated patients were satisfactorily anaesthetised with 0.15 mg/kg while other were only moderately sedated following doses of 0.5 mg/kg. Less variability was found in the elderly who also required smaller doses. Narcotic premedication potentiated the sedative effect of midazolam. Few respiratory or cardiovascular effects were noted apart from hiccough following the larger doses. The incidence of venous sequelae was much lower than that found following diazepam.", 
    "31": "Intraperitoneal injections with pentobarbital and diazepam caused an increase in the concentration of most plasma amino acids in rat. In contrast, tryptophan was significantly decreased after treatment with pentobarbital. The tyrosine level showed no change and was thus actually reduced after pentobarbital treatment in relation to the total pool of large neutral amino acids. The possibility should be considered that these changes in plasma amino acid patterns may lead to reduced transport of e.g. tryptophan and tyrosine into the brain, which in turn might retard the synthesis of monoaminergic neurotransmitters. The transport and action of several aromatic amino acids used as therapeutic agents may also be influenced.", 
    "32": "Fourteen patients with spasmodic torticollis and other segmental dystonic syndromes, who were refractory to previous forms of therapy, were selected for treatment with drugs intended to elevate brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. These patients were simultaneously given diazepam, isoniazid, pyridoxine, and large doses of L-glutamine. Involuntary spasmodic activity improved to varying degrees in 7 patients; in 2 the dyskinesia became worse. Transient alteration of renal or hepatic function occurred in 6 patients and mild euphoria unrelated to neurological improvement in 8. Two patients are still being treated. Deficiency of GABA may be a factor in some patients with these disorders.", 
    "33": "A patient who was partially immune to tetanus developed nonfulminant tetanus after a minor injury. Manifestations of the disease persisted for over 17 months. Electrophysiologic studies revealed an absent silent period in the masseter muscle, large-amplitude F-responses, and denervation. A muscle biopsy showed neurogenic atrophy with reinnervation. This observation supports the existence of chronic tetanus and provides morphologic evidence for a peripheral action of tetanus toxin in humans.", 
    "34": "A case of prolonged post-operative somnolence is described. The patient was on concurrent benzodiazepine and cimetidine therapy. Cimetidine can cause impairment of metabolism of the benzodiazepines by inhibiting the hepatic microsomal enzyme system and its possible role in causing the prolonged somnolence is discussed.", 
    "35": "Six slow acetylators (SAs) and six rapid acetylators (RAs), as determined by sulfamethazine (SMZ) phenotyping, were each given a 2-mg oral dose of clonazepam. Ninety-six-hour urine collections from these subjects were analyzed for clonazepam, 7-amino clonazepam (7-AM, clonazepam nitroreduced metabolite), and 7-acetamido clonazepam (7-ACT, N-acetylated 7-AM). The SA group excreted more 7-AM and less 7-ACT than the RA group; mean (+/- Sd) recovered as 7-AM was 22.7 +/- 5.0% for the SA group and 13.6 +/- 4.1% for the RA group and mean (+/- SD) recovered as 7-ACT was 1.5 +/- 0.4% for the SA group and 3.9 +/- 1.8% for the RA group. Both differences were substantial (p less than 0.02 by unpaired t test) and indicate that the rate of acetylation of 7-AM to 7-ACT in the biotransformation of clonazepam is determined by the acetylator phenotype.", 
    "36": "The effects on the quantitative EEG and behavior of two doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg) of the novel sedative compound brotizolam were compared to those of 10 mg flurazepam and placebo in a crossover study in 11 normal men. The effects of 0.1 mg brotizolam were equivalent in intensity and duration to those of 10 mg flurazepam, while the 0.3-mg dose of brotizolam was approximately three times as active. The relative physiologic equivalence of doses of brotizolam and flurazepam is 1 to 100. In its EEG profile, brotizolam is classified as a hypnotic-sedative substance. Its suggested use is as a substitute for established benzodiazepines that have hypnotic, sedative, and anticonvulsant activities.", 
    "37": "The purpose of this study was to define the EEG changes produced in humans by fentanyl 30-70 microgram/kg during cardiac surgery. The authors have also assessed awareness in the patients. Thirty-nine patients were studied; oral lorazepam or intramuscular morphine was used as premedication. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous injection of fentanyl over 2 min and the patients were ventilated with either air/O2 (24 patients) or N2O/O2 (15 patients). The EEGs recorded until the start of cardiopulmonary bypass were visually analyzed, classified into EEG stage, and plotted graphically as narcograms. Computerized 3-dimensional power spectral analysis and wide band spectral analysis were carried out on representative EEGs. The EEG effects of fentanyl are consistent and are characterized by high-voltage slow delta waves. Nitrous oxide had no effect on the EEG responses to fentanyl. Computer analysis confirmed the visual interpretation. There was no incidence of awareness. The authors conclude from this study that fentanyl after premedication is a suitable drug for providing unconsciousness, analgesia, and amnesia during cardiac surgery.", 
    "38": "Cimetidine has been shown to inhibit oxidative metabolism of several drugs while sparing the glucuronidation pathways of drug metabolism. We studied the time-course of inhibition and recovery of cimetidine-inhibited chlordiazepoxide elimination in 7 healthy subjects. Chlordiazepoxide elimination was studied after cimetidine treatment for 1 and 30 days, and after withdrawing cimetidine for 48 h. The plasma clearance of chlordiazepoxide was reduced by 54% (p less than 0.001) after 24 h of cimetidine, by 57% (p less than 0.001) after 30 days of cimetidine and returned to normal after cimetidine was stopped for 48 h. In the absence of changes in volume of distribution, these changes resulted in proportional increases in the elimination half-life (t 1/2 beta) after 24 h and 30 days cimetidine treatment, and returned to pretreatment values after stopping cimetidine. In addition, the impaired chlordiazepoxide elimination was accompanied by inhibition of generation and subsequent elimination of N-desmethylchlordiazepoxide, the first metabolite of chlordiazepoxide metabolism. This study demonstrates a rapid inhibitory effect on chlordiazepoxide elimination, an absence of tolerance to this effect and a rapid reversal of this effect upon stopping cimetidine. These findings may have important therapeutic implications for patients receiving both drugs simultaneously.", 
    "39": "A investigation was conducted to determine the specificity of the EMIT DAU method of drugs of abuse analysis. Drug-free urine, from healthy volunteers, was individually spiked at 1000, 100, 10, and 1 microgram/mL concentrations with each of 162 different drug substances. These spiked samples were analyzed with the EMIT DAU assay for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepine metabolites, cocaine metabolites, methadone, opiates, and propoxyphene. Although several of the test methods yielded positive results at a concentration of 100 micrograms/mL, many drugs will probably not reach that concentration in the urine. The number of drugs giving a false positive at a concentration of 100 micrograms/mL was very low. The assay for cocaine metabolites gave no false positive results at any of the concentrations studied while the assay for methadone gave the largest number of false positive results. When interpreting the results of this investigation one must consider that in many cases drug metabolites will exist in the urine, salt forms of the drugs studied were used, and ionic strength and pH effects can interfere with the lysozyme enzyme system used in the EMIT DAU assays. In summary, the proper utilization of specificity information may assist the analyst in explaining unusual values obtained in the laboratory, particularly when the subject is concurrently using prescription or nonprescription medication.", 
    "40": "The incidence of venous complications following intravenous diazepam administered to 190 dental out-patients was investigated in a prospective, randomized study. The administration into the smaller veins of the hand and forearm resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of thrombophlebitis. Use of a plastic catheter in place of an infusion needle or flushing with 150 ml of saline did not alter the incidence of venous complications. These results suggest that use of the larger veins of the antecubital fossa can lower the incidence of venous complications encountered in clinical practice following the intravenous administration of diazepam. These findings also suggest that use of a plastic catheter or post-drug administration flushing with saline does not affect the incidence of venous complications.", 
    "41": "Streptomyces refuineus, the microorganism which produces the DNA reactive antibiotic anthramycin, has shown to possess a quite specific mechanism to survive and grow in the presence of this antibiotic. Stationary phase cells are insensitive to anthramycin since the antibiotic is prevented form entering these cells. However, cells in early log phase are inhibited by concentrations of anthramycin that are later produced by these same cells. Significantly, sibiromycin, a closely related antibiotic, is taken up by cells of S. refuineus independent of the age of the culture. Anthramycin reacts in vitro equally as well as DNA isolated from S. refuineus and other procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. When S. refuineus has reached the production phase the anthramycin is probably biosynthesized outside the cell membrane which also becomes specifically impermeable to anthramycin.", 
    "42": "To assess the role of the N-alkyl group in the interaction of N-alkylated compounds on UDP-glucuronyltransferases, the effect of diazepam and nitrazepam, an N-desmethyl derivative of the diazepam class was studied on morphine, p-nitrophenol and testosterone glucuronidation in rats. Diazepam competitively inhibited the UDP-glucuroyltransferase activity for morphine in hepatic microsomes. The k value for morphine was 0.3 mM and the Ki for diazepam was about 0.23 mM. Also, diazepam administration to male rats reduced the glucuronyltransferase activity for morphine in rat hepatic microsomes in a dose effect relationship. Nitrazepam had no significant effect on morphine UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity in vitro or in in vivo experiments. Neither diazepam nor nitrazepam produced any effect on p-nitrophenol or testosterone glucuronidation in liver microsomal preparations. Single or repeated doses of these benzodiazepines did not change cytochrome P-450, RNA or protein contents of hepatic microsomes. It is suggested that morphine glucuronyltransferase contains an active site for binding of the N-methyl group present in the substrate. Such a binding site would be absent or in effective in p-nitrophenol and testosterone glucuronyltransferases. The reported inhibition of morphine metabolism by diazepam may account for an enhancement of morphine pharmacological effects.", 
    "43": "A procedure is presented for the concomitant identification and quantitation of certain commonly abused weak acid and natural drugs from whole blood. This procedure offers several advantages over other procedures in that: (A) a means of extraction of the drugs from blood using a very inexpensive source of diatomaceous earth (Celite 560) is presented, (B) the addition of three internal standards allows the quantitation of several drugs from blood with just one extraction of the blood sample, (C) the extracts are virtually free of any contaminants from biological sources or from biologically inert drug metabolites, and (D) the barbiturates and desmethyldiazepam are derivatized to enhance their limits of detection and reduce peak tailing frequently observed when using the nitrogen-phosphorous detector and gas chromatography (NPD/GC). Some 1000 positive driving-under-the-influence cases have been quantitated by this method.", 
    "44": "alpha-[3H]Dihydropicrotoxinin (DHP) and [3H]diazepam binding proteins were solubilized from rat brain membranes with 1% Lubrol-Px. Gel filtration of the Lubrol-solubilized fraction revealed that [3H]DHP and [3H]diazepam bind to two distinct peaks with apparent molecular weights of 185,000 and 61,000, respectively. The signal-to-noise ratio of [3H]DHP binding to 185,000-dalton fractions was improved significantly. [3H]DHP bound to the 185,000-dalton fraction with two binding constants. Muscimol and pentobarbital, while enhancing [3H]diazepam binding to membrane and crude Lubrol-solubilized fractions, failed to enhance [3H]diazepam binding to the 61,000-dalton fraction. Pentobarbital inhibited the binding of [3H]DHP to the 185,000-dalton fraction with an IC50 value of 60 +/- 12 micro M. The binding of [3H]DHP alos was inhibited by several depressant and convulsant drugs which affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated transmission. These results provide strong evidence that picrotoxinin and diazepam bind to two distinct proteins and that pentobarbital may act at the picrotoxinin-sensitive site of the benzodiazepine . GABA receptor . ionophore complex.", 
    "45": "Enuresis is a common problem often treated effectively with imipramine hydrochloride. The usefulness of this therapy carries with it, however, the risk of accidental overdose by younger siblings of these enuretic patients. Traditional support measures are effective in the treatment of the mild to moderate overdose, while separate symptomatic treatment of seizures and cardiac arrhythmias is possible as outlined herein. Physostigmine offers a single alternate treatment which is effective in the full panorama of life-threatening manifestations of an imipramine overdose.", 
    "46": "Benzodiazepine receptors mounted tissue sections of brain were localized by autoradiography using a tritium-sensitive sheet film (3H-Ultrofilm, LKB). The use of the film had many advantages compared to a previous technique utilizing emulsion-coated coverslips. A major advantage is the adaptability of the film to microdensitometric techniques for measurement of receptors. The densitometry can be carried out by computerized, color-coded image analysis.", 
    "47": "The recently discovered benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 was characterized in binding studies, and its potency and selectivity were determined in vivo by interaction with drug-induced changes in dopamine turnover and cerebellar cGMP level. Ro 15-1788 reduced [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the brain in vivo with a potency similar to that of diazepam and effectively inhibited [3H]diazepam binding in vitro (IC50 = 2.3 +/- 0.6 nmol/liter). [3H]Ro 15-1788 bound to tissue fractions of rat cerebral cortex with an apparent dissociation (KD) of 1.0 +/- 0.1 nmol/liter. The in vitro potency of various benzodiazepines in displacing [3H]Ro 15-1788 from its binding site was of the same rank order as found previously in [3H]diazepam binding. Autoradiograms of [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in sections of rat cerebellum showed the same distribution of radioactivity as with [3H]flunitrazepam. The attenuating effect of diazepam on the chlorpromazine- or stress-induced elevation of homovanillic acid in rat brain was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. Among a series of compounds which either decreased or increased the rat cerebellar cGMP level, only the effect of benzodiazepine receptor ligands (diazepam, zopiclone, CL 218 872) was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. Thus, Ro 15-1788 is a selective benzodiazepine antagonist acting at the level of the benzodiazepine receptor in the central nervous system. Peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in kidney and schistosomes were not affected by Ro 15-1788.", 
    "48": "The colocalization and interaction of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in the rat brain were characterized using standardized, quantitative, light microscopic autoradiographic methods. In serial sections, striking differences were observed in the distribution of high affinity GABA and BZ receptors in areas such as the cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus and cerebellar cortex. However, in a semiquantitative visual examination of more than 200 brain regions, added exogenous GABA increased BZ binding in all regions. In a quantitative analysis of 19 regions, exogenous GABA uniformly stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding, the effect being proportional to the regional density of BZ receptors. No relationship was seen between the magnitude of the stimulation and the distribution of high affinity GABA receptors. In the mounted tissue sections, BZ binding appeared influenced by endogenous GABA since it was reduced by preincubation or by the addition of bicuculline. Taken together, these data suggest that most or all BZ receptors can be influenced by GABA and are coupled to a type of GABA receptor. However, the BZ-linked GABA receptor could represent either a subpopulation of GABA binding sites or a distinct receptor not labeled under the conditions used in these and other experiments.", 
    "49": "Specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam is found in the mammalian retina and its characteristics are similar in important respects to those in the cerebral cortex. Numerous reports have shown that monosodium glutamate (MSG) given neonatally to rats results in neuronal cell death with sparing of photoreceptor and glial cells. Sprague-Dawley rats were given MSG (3.2 mg/g i.p.) from day 2 to day 12 after birth; controls received equimolar injections of NaCl. At 8 to 9 weeks of age, the rats were killed and [3H]flunitrazepam binding was examined in the retinas are various brain regions. Histologic evidence showed the virtual absence of ganglion cells and a marked reduction of neurons in the inner nuclear layer of retinas from MSG-treated rats; photoreceptor and Muller cells appeared normal. In the retinas from MSG-treated rats, gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were decreased by 73% and the Bmax of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was decreased by 77%; there was no change in Kd. In the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus of MSG-treated rats, [3H]flunitrazepam binding was unchanged. These results strengthen the association of gamma-aminobutyric acid mechanisms with benzodiazepine binding and suggest a predominant neuronal localization of the binding sites.", 
    "50": "Polysomnographic recordings allow the recognition of three normal sleep stages: wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep. There are quantitative changes in these stages from childhood to old age. Most characteristic are progressive decreases in total sleep time, stage 4 NREM sleep and REM sleep. Insomnia can be defined as an alteration of both the quantity and quality of sleep. It can be associated with psychophysiological factors, psychiatric disorders, use of drugs and alcohol, sleep apnea, sleep-related myoclonus and restless legs, medical, toxic and environmental conditions, or REM sleep interruptions. At present, the benzodiazepines are the most frequently prescribed hypnotics. Their efficacy has been evaluated in the sleep laboratory and by means of sleep questionnaires (clinical studies). Their derivatives are grouped according to their pharmacokinetic profiles as short acting (triazolam), intermediate acting (flunitrazepam) and long acting (flurazepam). At the EEG level these compounds induce an increase in fast frequencies and in the number of sleep spindles. Slow wave activity is markedly decreased. All of the derivatives effectively and significantly induce and maintain sleep. Total sleep time increase is related to an imcrement of stage 2 sleep while REM sleep and stages 3 + 4 sleep are consistently reduced. Triazolam withdrawal is followed by a rebound insomnia. In contrast, under the same circumstances, flurazepam has a carry-over effect.", 
    "51": "In a double-blind, cross-over trial, triazolam (0.25 mg) was tested against flunitrazepam (1 mg) in the typical midwinter insomnia which is often seen among otherwise healthy people in Northern Norway. Each drug was given for five nights, in random order, with a five-night placebo period between the active drugs (providing for a single blind comparison with placebo). A total of 2 outpatients started the trial; 19 completed. There were highly significant differences between each active drug and placebo on the subjectively scored variables sleep latency, duration of sleep, and total evaluation of sleep, and also significant differences for feeling in the morning, number of awakenings, and quality of sleep; all differences were in favour of the active drugs. Generally, the sleep variables were rated on the same level in the placebo period as they were for the last five nights prior to the trial. There were no significant differences between triazolam and flunitrazepam on any variable. However, eight patients stated a preference for triazolam and eight for flunitrazepam. These two groups of patients did not differ significantly with regard to sex, age, previous use of hypnotics, or severity of insomnia. Only three patients complained about side effects. Notably, the feeling of being alert and refreshed in the morning was significantly superior in the active drug periods as against the placebo period. It is concluded that both active drugs were highly effective, with a minimum of side effects, in this type of insomnia and with the relatively low dosage used.",
