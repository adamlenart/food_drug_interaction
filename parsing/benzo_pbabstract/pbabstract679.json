Diazepam alone had no effect on the response of tibialis anterior muscle to indirect stimulation in dogs. Again, diazepam in a bolus dose of 5 mg did not influence a pre-existing partial block by d-tubocurarine, gallamine or pancuronium. But a significant increase in both the degree and duration of block was observed when diazepam and d-tubocurarine were given simultaneously, suggesting an agonist action in diazepam. On the contrary, simultaneous use of diazepam and gallamine caused a significantly less intense block of tibialis muscle twitch tension as compared to gallamine alone, suggesting an antagonistic action. The degree and duration of block by d-tubocurarine were not affected significantly by simultaneous administration of diazepam in human beings. It is, therefore, concluded that diazepam in clinical doses can be safely used with d-tubocurarine in humans.", 
    "1": "Clonazepam is a new benzodiazepine anticonvulsant recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of typical absence, infantile myoclonic, atypical absence, myoclonic, and akinetic seizures. It is rapidly absorbed by the oral route and appears to pass quickly from blood to brain. Preliminary results indicate a biological half-life of 22 to 32 hours and a therapeutic serum concentration of 5 to 50 ng/ml. Many studies report tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects with chronic administration. Major side effects of the drug are drowsiness, ataxia, and behavior changes. They tend to be dose related, occur early in the course of therapy, and may subside with chronic administration. Accordingly, the dosage is begun at a low level and increased slowly.", 
    "2": "In a controlled clinical investigation based on ten patients with simple absences and ten patients with myoclonic atonic seizures, all patients who had insufficient response to conventional antiepileptic treatment received clonazepam (Rivotril [Denmark]; Clonopin, comparable US product) combined with previous antiepileptic drugs. The effects of the combined use of clonazepam and the previous antiepileptid drugs were compared with the effects of placebo combined with the same drugs. The trial was single-blind crossover with sequential analysis. In a daily dose of usually 3 to 6 mg, depending on patient age, the antiepileptic effect of clonazepam was significantly superior to placebo and was estimated as remarkably good. Side-effects of somnolence, fatigue, drowsiness, and coordination disturbances occurred in most of the patients, but subsided spontaneously or could be controlled by slow increase or slight reduction of dosage. Mental sideeffects such as agitation, confusion, and aggressiveness were more troublesome and caused discontinuation of clonazepam in two patients.", 
    "3": "A randomized partial cross-over clinical trial of two intravenous techniques for outpatient conservative dentistry was performed in 61 patients. Subanaesthetic incremental doses of Althesin were used at 52 sessions and a single sedative dose of diazepam at 45 sessions. Each technique produced similar cardiovascular and respiratory changes. With Althesin, recovery after operation was more rapid and there was some evidence of a stronger anxiolytic effect and of less frequent and less severe thrombophlebitis. In contrast, Althesin was sometimes associated with jaw tremor or shivering and was less frequently mentioned by those patients who expressed a strong preference for one of the two techniques.", 
    "4": "The effect of Diazepam (Valium), Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A, Novomina, Epha Retard), Sulpirid (Dogmatil) and Placebo has been investigated in regard to the intensity of pathological vestibular spontaneous nystagmus by application of the double blind method on 50 patients with peripheral vestibular (n = 37) and central vestibular (n = 12) diseases, as well as on a case of spontaneous nystagmus of undefined origin. Since by acute vestibular disease the intensity of spontaneous nystagmus is generally closely related to the severity of vertigo, the influence on a pathological spontaneous nystagmus by antivertiginosa seems to be a dependable criterium in the evaluation of their effectiveness. Dimenhydrinate (2 mg/kg KG) and Sulpirid (2.86 mg/kg KG) led to a statistically significant reduction, however not in the case of Diazepam and Placebo. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of Dimenhydrinate and Sulpirid is not definitely predictable in individual cases: in 2 out of 10 patients the preparations were without effect. Characteristics and areas of indication of Dimenhydrinate and Sulpirid are described in greater detail.", 
    "5": "A spectral analysis technique for quantifying dyskinesia in patients with diagnosis of Hungtington's Disease (chorea) (H.D.) is described. Spectral analysis involves computation of the magnitude of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMS) and of their distribution in frequency. It has the advantage of providing an objective measure of such movements. Three H.D. patients under different drug regimens and three age-matched controls have been evaluated and representative time records and power spectra are presented. Analysis established marked differences in the amplitude and shape of the normal and patient spectra. In addition, spectral analysis proved sensitive to differences in drug treatments among patients suggesting its additional use in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents in the treatment of movement disorders.", 
    "6": "In sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal muscles the activity of Ca2+, Mg2+- dependent ATPase was distinctly inhibited under effect of neuroleptic drugs - derivatives of phenothiazine and butyrophenone. The effect of tricyclic antidepressants was less pronounced. Tranquilizers (derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepine) inhibited the enzyme, but trioxazin was only slightly active. High concentrations of lithium salts and of psychostimulants caffeine and corasole were found to stimulate the Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity; low concentrations of the substances slightly inhibited the enzyme. The blocking effect of psychotropic drugs was more distinct, if the enzyme preparations were previously treated with ATP.", 
    "7": "Several so-called 'non-specific' or 'non-drug' factors are known to interfere with the response to psychotropic drug administration. Animal emotionality has been reported to change the outcome of psychoactive drug administration, so that the response to a stimulant or depressant drug may considerably change according to the baseline state of activity of the central nervous system. Prolonged socio-encironmental deprivation or isolation has been shown to produce in rats three different types of abnormal behaviour which have been tentatively defined as 'friendly', 'indifferent' and 'muricide'. Such unusual changes in rat behaviour are assumed to reflect a series of different emotional changes. The present experiments show that psychoactive drugs can exert a different effect in relation to the different kinds of animal behaviour used in the experiments. The investigation of the properties of psychoactive compounds, as performed in experimental animals showing behavioural alterations, is then suggested as being more fruitful in providing much information closer to the clinical results than that achieved with the experiments performed in normal laboratory animals.", 
    "8": "The anticonvulsive effect of Lorazepam -- one of the newer diazepines -- has been tested in 10 patients with induced epileptic conditions under continuous polygraphic control. The quantitative analysis of the paroxysmal discharges -- i.e. the evolution of the \"paroxysmal index\" -- shows that 5 mg IV Lorazepam normalize the tracings in 2.3 minutes. Parenteral Lorazepam inhibits pharmacologically-induced electroencephalographic abnormalities in man. Its action is slightly delayed. No effect on cardiac or respiratory function, or muscle tone was noted.", 
    "9": "Using a food-reinforced two-lever operant method, rats (n = 12) were trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, p.o.) from solvent (p.o.). With rats trained thus as subjects, generalization experiments were done with various benzodiazepines, barbiturates and related compounds, and with two neuroleptic drugs. The ability of these drugs to induce a discriminative stimulus complex similar to that induced by chlordiazepoxide, was then compared with some intrinsic and anticonvulsant effects of the same drugs. It was found that the discriminative stimulus properties of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and related compounds correlate with the ability of these drugs to induce ataxia, as well as with part of their anticonvulsant activity. However, the stimulus properties of these drugs, as defined by the procedure described, are based neither on their ataxia-inducing effect, nor on their general depressant or sedative action. It is concluded that these properties constitute a pharmacologically highly specific phenomenon.", 
    "10": "The results from six separate evaluations of flurazepam 30 mg in the sleep laboratory were combined to determine the effectiveness of the drug in inducing and maintaining sleep and its effects on sleep stages in a large sample of insomniac subjects. The combined studies provide a model from which a detailed profile of the effects of a hypnotic drug over short-, intermediate-, and long-term conditions can be thoroughly evaluated. Although sleep was significantly improved on the first night of flurazepam administration, peak effectiveness of the drug did not result until the second and third consecutive drug nights. Flurazepam continued to be effective in inducing and maintaining sleep with intermediate-and long-term drug use with only a slight loss of effectiveness with long-term use. Sleep was also significantly improved on the first and second nights of drug withdrawal. Carryover effectiveness of active metabolites of flurazepam from one drug night to the next drug night and to withdrawl nights is discussed. The clinical implications are discussed with regard to the time of peak effectiveness of the drug, dosage recommendations and schedule, minimizing possible effects of the drug on daytime performance, and the rationale and method for using drug holidays in the treatment regimen. With this comprehensive profile of the drug's actions, the physician is able to more rationally and effectively utilize the drug in treating the insomniac patient. With short-term administration, flurazepam produced a slight decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and an increase in REM latency. These effects were much more pronounced with intermediate-term drug administration, again possibly due to the accumulation of active metabolites. After withdrawal there was no rebound in REM sleep. Stages 3 and 4 sleep decreased progressively through short and intermediate drug administration. With initial withdrawal, there was a slight recovery in both sleep stages.", 
    "11": "Forty male volunteer patients undergoing regional anesthesia were evaluated for alertness and memory in a double-blind study which compared IV lorazepam (4 mg) plus IM meperidine (50 mg) with IV placebo plus IM meperidine (50 mg) as premedicants. The data indicate no significant retrograde effects. Significant differences at all measurement points from 20 minutes to 3 hours following IV drug administration indicated greater sedation and less recall and recognition of events and stimuli (auditory and visual) with the combination of lorazepam and meperidine than with placebo and meperidine. A significant number of patients over age 40 were judged to be excessively sedated after administration of lorazepam. However, respiration, blood pressure, and pulse did not appear to be differentially affected by lorazepam and there were no adverse changes even in patients considered to be oversedated.", 
    "12": "Ketamine given IV in a dose of 2 mg/kg caused a significant reduction in Pao2 in 7 patients spontaneously breathing with an unassisted airway. Under the same conditions, in 7 patients, ketamine (2 mg/kg IV) preceded by diazepam (0.2 mg/kg IV) also caused a reduction in Pao2 not significantly different from that caused by ketamine. In some patients, alarmingly low levels of Pao2 ( less than or equal to 40 torr) were seen following ketamine administration. Based on these findings, the authors recommend that O2 and ventilatory assistance accompany ketamine given IV for anesthesia.", 
    "13": "Twenty-two clinical laboratory tests performed on blood samples from 16 normal subjects following one week of either flurazepam or placebo administered in a double-blind method showed no apparent chemical interference by flurazepam on any of the testing procedures.", 
    "14": "The introduction of formalized systems for data acquisition provide a basis for the investigation of medical decision making. Patients admitted to a general medical ward completed a comprehensive, medical history. Decisions relating to their subsequent diagnosis, investigation and management were made after complete investigation and were recorded with their questionnaire responses. A computer programme was developed to compare questionnaire responses from patients who did, and patients who did not have each particular decision made, and to assign a value to each question depending on the significance of its association with the decision. The set of values, one for each question, was termed a decision profile and was characteristic of that decision.", 
    "15": "The diagnosis of infarcts has been improved by inclusion of serum enzyme determinations, among other things. The determination of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) plays a particular role in hospital routine. In the present paper, the effect of intramuscular application of drugs on the serum CPK values is investigated. It is shown that an intramuscular injection is followed by a rise of serum CPK to pathological levels, so that CPK determination loses its significance in differential diagnosis.", 
    "16": "The effects of oral oxprenolol (320 mg) or propranolol (240 or 320 mg) and of diazepam (5 mg) or lorazepam (2 mg) on pursuit rotor performance, reaction time and critical flicker frequency were investigated in healthy subjects in 3 separate studies. A 240-mg dose of propranolol significantly impaired pursuit rotor performance but not 320 mg of propranolol or oxprenolol. Both beta-adrenoceptor blockers did not affect reaction time or critical flicker frequency. Diazepam impaired pursuit rotor performance and reaction time, but not critical flicker frequency. Lorazepam generally impaired all three parameters. The findings suggest that it is possible for beta-adrenoceptor blockers to depress skeletal muscle activity without having a central effect, as shown by impairment of CNS function tests which rely also on muscle coordination but not of those relying only on central activity. These results also show that single oral doses of oxprenolol or propranolol, as high as 320 mg, do not have central effects, and support the belief that small anxiolytic doses of these blockers exert their actions through peripheral blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "17": "Male and female rats received during infancy either handling or injections of saline, phenobarbital, haloperidol, diazepam, chlorpromazine, and amphetamine. On reaching adulthood, the behavior of these animals was measured in an open-field arena and in a Lashley III maze. Saline injections per se affected the behavior of males but were unable to change that of females. The drugs provoked increased ambulation and/or decreased defecation of males in the open field, whereas with the females the opposite was observed, that is, a decreased ambulation and/or an increased defecation. Consequently, the early drug treatments abolished the sexual differences normally observed in ambulation and defecation of rats. Four of the 5 drugs tested deteriorated the maze performance of both male and female rats.", 
    "18": "A sensitive and specific electron capture-gas chromatographic assay was developed for the determination of 7-iodo-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5(2'-fluorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (I) and its major metabolites in blood and urine. The overall recovery of I and its N-desmethyl metabolite (II) from blood is apparently quantitative. The recovery of the major urinary metabolite, the N-desmethyl-3-hydroxy analog (IV), and the minor metabolites, the N-desmethyl analog (II) and the N-methyl-3-hydroxy analog (III) added to urine as authentic reference standards ranged from 80 to 85%. The sensitivity limits of detection are of the order of 2-3 ng of I and 4-5 ng of II per ml of blood or urine. The method was applied to the determination of blood levels and the urinary excretion pattern in a dog following oral and intravenous administration of a 1-mg/kg dose (total 13 mg), and in man following the intravenous administration of single 5- and 10-mg doses. The N-desmethyl metabolite II was more predominant in dog blood than was the orally or intravenously administered I, but II was barely measurable in human blood.", 
    "19": "The birth of a flaccid neonate is described. Oxytocin, diazepam and extradural bupivacaine were used during labour. The baby survived 1 1/2 hours of artificial ventilation and was subsequently healthy. An account is given of the assessment of foetal maturity and the diagnosis of neonatal flaccidity is discussed.", 
    "20": "The metabolism of 14C-5-diazepam has been studied in 5 patients with T tube biliary drainage. A single bolus of 40 to 50 muCi was given intravenously and blood, urine, and bile were analyzed from 5 to 14 days. The mean half-life of elimination from blood was 93.2 hr; the major metabolite noted in blood was N-desmethyl-diazepam. In urine the average recovery of radioactivity was 48.9% and consisted of 3 OH-diazepam, 4'OH-diazepam, and oxazepam. In bile the average recovery of radioactivity was 5.35% (corrected to a bile flow of 700 ml was 15.0%) and consisted of the same metabolites as in the urine. Essentially no diazepam or N-desmethyl-diazepam was found, and therefore an enterohepatic circulation cannot be held to account for the prolonged half-life of these substances in man.", 
    "21": "We studied the relationship between side effects, clinical outcome and the drug plasma levels in 28 female depressed patients treated with protriptyline. After 3 1/2 weeks treatment, patients with plasma levels within a median range (630 to 900 nmol/l) showed better responses to the drug than patients with plasma levels outside this range. There were no statistically signficant correlations between plasma levels and side effect scores or 'corrected' side effect scores (scores after subtracting pretreatment values) for the group at any time after starting the treatment. But we found positive correlations between plasma levels and 'corrected' side effect scores for the neurotic subgroup after 14 and 21 days of treatment. Other correlations between plasma levels and side effect scores were non-significant.", 
    "22": "An uncoordinated and ineffectual sucking reflex is a major manifestation of neonatal narcotic abstinence and may have important consequences for the infant's subsequent well being. Measures of nutritive sucking were used to monitor the severity of neonatal narcotic abstinence in a series of infants born to narcotic-dependent mothers who were either attending the methadone clinic or else were \"street addicts.\" In all these infants, sucking measures were significantly reduced relative to normal control subjects. Furthermore, the sucking behavior of infants born to mothers attending the methadone clinic was significantly more depressed than that of infants born to street addicts. In regard to the salutary effects of pharmacotherapy for neonatal narcotic abstinence, infants treated with paregoric approached normal control levels and showed significantly better sucking than those treated with phenobarbital or diazepam. The latter drug practically eliminated all spontaneous nutritive sucking behavior.", 
    "23": "The value of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults is well established. This study of 50 children demonstrates that upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be performed safely and effectively in this age group without general anesthesia. Endoscopy appears more sensitive than radiology in the detection not only of superficial mucosal lesions, but of gastric and duodenal ulcers as well.", 
    "24": "The only clinically detectable cardiovascular changes after intravenous diazepam administration are a moderate fall in systolic blood pressure and a rise in pulse rate. But it will produce significant cardiovascular changes, principally the lowering of total peripheral resistance and stroke volume. The drug has a long history of safety but is not totally innocuous. It is suggested that if diazepam is used in combination with methohexital, consideration should be given to the additive effects on total peripheral resistance.", 
    "25": "The administration of delta9THC intravenously as a premedicant to oral surgery resulted in acute pronounced elevations in anxiety states, a predominance of dysphoria over euphoria, and varying degrees of psychotic-like paranoiac thought. Neural effects that appeared to promote these effects included distortions of perception with sensory delusions, and heightened sensory receptiveness including antalgesic impressions of surgery; autonomic and visceral arousal greater than control or placebo levels; lack of overt behavioral signals of distress due to depersonalization; and time disintegration leading to fear-inducing misinformation about real surgical events. Introverted subjects who generally were inclined to rely on drug solutions to their problems tended to respond poorly to surgical pain and anxiety with delta9THC. These results, obtained from subjects considered to have levels of presurgical apprehension that were average or below average, suggest that the environment in which high doses of cannabinols are experienced is a potent factor in determining the quality of the emotional response. A surgical environment containing even the mild stress of outpatient oral surgery appears to have the potential to precipitate undesirable emotional responses among cannabinol-intoxicated patients. There is continued high-level social use of cannabinols inour society, with an estimate of 40% to 55% among the college-age group seen frequently by oral surgeons. Results of this study suggest that clinicians should be prepared to detect the subtle signs of marijuana intoxication to protect their patients from further psychophysiologic complications during surgery.", 
    "26": "We attempted induction of the conflict behavior by the locus pattern, thumping and conditioning under hypothalamic stimulation in rabbits. Flight was classified as continuous and non-continuous. Thumping was elicited post stimulus. Conditioning responses were obtained during the autonomic-somatic responses, continuous run and non-continuous run. All drugs were administrated orally. Dosage of each drug used in this experiment was calculated by determining the dosage which caused the same degree of muscle relaxation and sedative action in mice (see, Fig. 1) or general behavior in rabbits. Diazepam 5 mg/kg, chlordiazepoxide 10 mg/kg and nitrazepam 1 mg/kg caused non-continuous flight in the smooth run, but chlorpromazine 5 mg/kg induced continuous run with snarling. Methamphethamine 5 mg/kg induced continuous run and autonomic-somatic tonus pattern, and phenobarbital-Na 30 mg/kg depressed the animal to the stage of flight. Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and phenobarbital-Na inhibited thumping, while chlorpromazine, nitrazepam and methamphethamine increased the incidence of thumping. Chlorpromazine transformed the non-continuous run into autonomic-somatic responses of conditioning. Diazepam transformed the non-continuous run into a continuous one. Phenobarbital-Na transformed the non-continuous run into autonomic-somatic responses. Methamphethamine transformed the non-continuous run into a withdrawal response. It would thus appear that the non-continuous flight, thumping and the non-continuous run conditioning are forms of conflict in behavior which can be applied to study of emotional response with psychotropic drugs.", 
    "27": "The effects of oral administration of clonazepam, a new benzodiazepine derivative (F. Hoffmann-La Roche), on the central nervous system were compared with those of diazepam and several anticonvulsants in mice and rats. 1) Clonazepam exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect on the locomotor activity observed with open-field situation in mice and no effect in rats, while it inhibited markedly the rearing behavior in both animals, the duration of action being approximately six hours. 2) Clonazepam potentiated the methamphetamine-induced hyper-locomotor activity in mice whereas trimethadione had no effect. 3) Clonazepam inhibited with a moderate potency the conditioned avoidance response and response to a fixed-ratio (FR 20) schedule of food reinforcement in rats, the potency being a little weaker than that of diazepam. 4) The muscle relaxant effect of clonazepam determined by the traction test was slightly more potent as compared with that of diazepam. Thiopental hypnosis was markedly potentiated after clonazepam. 5) The clonic (CL), tonic-flexor (TF) and extensor convulsions (TE) induced by pentetrazol were strongly inhibited after clonazepam in mice, anticonvulsant potency against CL and TE of clonazepam being approximately 23 and 21 times stronger than that of diazepam, 3333 and 3846 times that of trimethadione, and over 3047 and 178 times that of phenytoin, respectively. Clonazepam reduced markedly CL and TE elicited by bemegride with about 12 to 14 times stronger potency than diazepam. On the contrary, the anticonvulsant effect of clonazepam against TE of maximal electroshock seizure evoked by supramaximal current was weak, the potency being 0.71 times weaker than that of phenacemide, 0.14 times than phenytoin and 0.24 times than phenobarbital. By the combined administration of clonazepam with other anticonvulsants such as trimethadione and phenytoin against pentetrazol convulsion, and phenacemide, phenytoin and phenobarbital against maximal electroshock seizure, the antagonistic effect of these anticonvulsants was potentiated by 4 to 5 times. 6) The acute toxicity (LD50) of clonazepam was weak but that of phenacemide or phenytoin was potentiated to a certain degree by combined administration with clonazepam. The results suggest that clonazepam has a psychopharmacological profile similar to that of benzodiazepines with a particularly potent anticonvulsant effect on pentetrazol and bemegride convulsions, and the anticonvulsant effect is synergic with that of other anticonvulsants.", 
    "28": "The effects of diazepam (2.5 and 5 mg) and amylobarbitone sodium (50 and 100 mg) on performance and subjective effects were assessed in a group of twelve healthy subjects under standardised conditions. Treatments were administered orally at weekly intervals according to a balanced design and under double-blind conditions. The tests of performance most sensitive to drug effects in these healthy subjects were either prolonged and monotonous and gave the subject no feedback on performance, or required short term memory for efficient execution. Auditory vigilance was significantly impaired (P less than 0.05) between 45 min and 1 h 45 min after all drug treatments except amylobarbitone sodium (100 mg), compared with performance after lactose. At the same time false reports were significantly increased after amylobarbitone sodium (100 mg) compared with all other active drugs but not with lactose. These effects had disappeared 4-5 h post drug. Short term memory was impaired 1h 45 min after all treatments and impairment was dose related. No significant effects occurred 5h after treatment. Simple auditory reaction time was prolonged 2 h after the highest doses of amylobarbitone sodium and diazpam, and by amylobarbitone sodium (50 mg) 5 h 15 min after treatment. At this time the effects of diazepam had worn off. Digit symbol substitution was impaired by amylobarbitone sodium (50 and 100 mg), and diazepam (5 mg) after 2 h 45 minutes. No significant changes in visual search or tapping occurred after active drugs compared with lactose. Subjective ratings indicated both mental and motor impairment 2 h 45 min after all active preparations compared with scores after lactose though significant changes followed diazepam (2.5 mg) infrequently. Both correct detections and false reports in auditory vigilance tended to fall over the 6 separate days of testing, indicating an increase in caution. Visual search, short term memory, tapping and digit symbol substitution significantly improved with time, but there was no change in reaction time. From the limited information obtained by sampling blood at 3 and 6 h, no relationship between change in performance and plasma level was found in these subjects.", 
    "29": "The external sphincter spasticity syndrome is described with regard to diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology and treatment. Use of urodynamic techniques (especially urethral pressure profile and diagnostic pudendal blocks) and adrenolytic agents and diazepam in the treatment of the dysfunction is discussed. We consider this clinical entity to be much more common than perviously reported.", 
    "30": "The influence of intravenous administration of diazepam (Faustan) on focal e.e.g. changes was checked in 34 patients. Bioelectric functional disturbances may remain unchanged, may be provoked or abolished; apparently etiological aspects are not decisive. According to the authors' results, the value of this provocation method for the differentiation of space-occupying intracranial processes and cerebrovascular disturbances should be regarded with caution.", 
    "31": "Supported by extensive clinical data of three generations, the hypothesis is advanced that Minimal Brain Dysfunction is the major etiologic and pathogenic factor for one subgroup of adult schizophrenics. Genetic factors apparently play the main but not exclusive role. Pathogenic as well as diagnostic, therapeutic, prognostic, and preventive aspects are discussed.", 
    "32": "The author studied vegetative provisions in different forms of activiity (mental, physical and emotional) detected in focal lesions of the limbico-reticular structure of 91 patients and 9 normals. Among the studied contingent 38 had focal lesions of the temporal lobe, 31 -- of the hypothalamus and 22--of the brain stem. Vegetative activity was studied by registrations of the frequency of heart contractions and by a subsequent mathematical processing. It was possible to demonstrate an excessive degree of vegetative provision in all groups the following factors: the localization of the process, the initial degree of vegetative disturbances, the expressiveness of emotional changes. In a moderate expressiveness of psycho-vegetative disturbances there is a higher degree of vegetative provisions than in expressed psychovegetative syndromes. These data may serve as an explantation to the origination of such clinical conditions as asthenical states and disorders of adaptation in different forms of activity.", 
    "33": "1. Frequency power spectra and mutual coherence functions of 8 stimulatenously recorded E.E.G. derivations have been computed in approximately 500 non-specially selected patients referred to the department for E.E.G. recording. 2. On basis of the data obtained some provisionnal conclusions have been drawn, the most important of those being that the analyses contribute significantly and in some cases essentially to the understanding of the E.E.G. and therefore should be carried out in all E.E.Gs recorded to our department. 3. It has been observed that mu rhythms and beta rhythms appear to be essentially different from alpha rhythms by exhibiting no bilateral coherence whereas alpha rhythms almost invariably are considerably bilateral coherent.", 
    "34": "Diazepam 0.05-0.25 mg/kg increased the dose of lignocaine required to cause seizures in Rhesus monkeys by 24-34%. Spontaneous ventilation was maintained adequately during lignocaine administration following diazepam treatment and no adverse cardiovascular effects occurred. Before the onset of lignocaine-induced seizures in non-treated animals, the animals appeared to be drowsy. However, prior to administration of diazepam masked this effect. Convulsions were controlled by smaller doses of diazepam in non-treated animals than in diazepam-treated animals. Also, the animals that were pretreated with diazepam had a greater duration of depression after seizure.", 
    "35": "Tibezonium iodide is a new drug having antibacterial activity for the therapy and the prevention of mouth infections. Before testing its therapeutic efficacy, its effect on the bacterial flora of the human saliva was verified as follows. Salivary samples, collected before and after the administration (double-blind, cross-over) to volunteers, were counted for bacteria. The drug reduced the bacterial count in the saliva with statistical significance in both the pharmaceutical forms. Subsequently the drug was tested in different dental or oral conditions. To 90 patients suffering from marginal paradentitis or other diseases with this type of complications tablets were administered. The results obtained in this group were satisfactory or almost satisfactory in 73.5% of the cases examined. The patients treated with bubble-gums were 70. All of them were suffering from the same kind of disease of the first group; a few of them had alveolitis following tooth extraction. The results in these subjects were satisfactory or almost satisfactory in 77% of the cases examined. Tibezonium proved to be particularly effective in marginal paradentitis and in piorrhoic paradontosis. Bubble-gums should not be used in subjects with dental mobile prosthesis.", 
    "36": "A philosophy for the use of sedation and anxiety control in everyday dental practice is described. The need for greater education in basic sedation techniques is emphasized.", 
    "37": "The effects of dantrolene sodium and diazepam were compared in a double crossover study of 42 patients with spasticity due to stable multiple sclerosis. Both drugs reduced the findings of spasticity, clonus, and hyperreflexia, and the complaints of muscle stiffness and cramping. Each drug had different side effects which suggest indications and contraindications for its use in spastic patients.", 
    "38": "Thirteen subjects received diazepam 0.3 mg/kg i.v. twice with a 2-week interval between the doses. In seven subjects who had eaten at 3 h after the injection, reactive skills in a choice reaction test were impaired significantly (P less than 0.05) and there was a 20% increase in the serum diazepam concentrations at 5 h. When the meal was eaten at 7 h, a 50% increase (P less than 0.01) in the serum diazepam concentration was not associated with a significant impairment in psychomotor skills. In a second group of six subjects charcoal ingestion failed to hasten the clearance of diazepam from serum, and did not affect recovery of co-ordinative skills. In a third group of 12 subjects receiving diazepam 0.15 mg/kg i.v. twice at an interval of 2 weeks, the rapid injection of diazepam resulted in a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) degree of drooping of the upper eyelid and in a greater incidence of amnesia to abdominal pinching. The subjects also experienced more pain in the arm during the faster injection (P less than 0.01). Late effects on psychomotor skills were similar with both rates of injection. The results suggest that the remobilization of diazepam from its storage site after food intake induces a late impairment of psychomotor skills, especially if the food is eaten within less than 5 h after the injection. A rapid i.v. injection of diazepam induces greater sedative and amnesic effects than a slow injection of the same dose, but the slow injection of a greater dose is preferable because of the possibility of thrombophlebitis after rapid injection.", 
    "39": "In a double-blind study of 44 depressive in-patients, treatment with placebo appeared to give equally good results as did treatment with thioridazine. Both treatment procedures permitted the additional prescription of chlordiazepoxide when the patient's condition indicated the need for anxiety reduction. The use of chlordiazepoxide was more frequently necessary with treatment with placebo than with treatment with thioridazine.", 
    "40": "Thirty-two anxious nonpsychotic inpatients participated in a four-day, double-blind repeat crossover study of a new drug, GPA 2640, and placebo. Each treatment period lasted for one day, and the study lasted for four days. Twenty patients completed the study, and 28 completed two or three days. The doses were individually adjusted and mostly ranged between 1100 and 1300 mg daily. Several valid observer-rating and self-rating scales were used. There was a slight trend for GPA 2640 to yield somewhat lower anxiety scores on drug days than on placebo days, but none of the differences between rating and self-rating scores reached a significant level. A few patients reported a marked improvement in mood after two to four days, but the significance of this finding cannot be evaluated from this design. Two patients developed temporary paranoid delusions which may have been drug related. Two patients had raised SGOT levels after the study. There were no significant differences in vital signs between drug days and placebo days. The results signify that the drug has no immediate antianxiety effects (such as have been demonstrated with benzodiazepines in two previous studies utilizing the same design). This does not preclude the possibility of delayed anxiolytic effects or of other delayed psychotropic effects such as can be observed with antipsychotic drugs or antidepressants.", 
    "41": "Oxazepam (Serax) is a tranquilizer-sedative of the benzodiazepine group that is predominantly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive glucuronide and subsequently excreted by way of the kidneys. We administered this drug as a single oral dose to seven patients with acute viral hepatitis, to six with cirrhosis, and to age-matched control subjects. Elimination half-life (T1/2) and the apparent oral plasma clearance for the drug in patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis were comparable to values obtained in age-matched controls (P greater than 0.05). In addition, the apparent volume of distribution of oxazepam, its plasma binding, blood/plasma ratio, and the rate of urinary excretion of oxazepam, predominantly as the glucuronide, were comparable (p greater than 0.05) in the two groups of patients with liver disease and their respective controls. Unlike many other sedatives, oxazepam is eliminated normally in patients with parenchymal liver disease an therefore, on pharmacokinetic grounds, seems to be an excellent sedative for use in such persons.", 
    "42": "A patient is described with severe intention myoclonus which was made worse by treatment with L-Dopa and improved by clonazepam. Family history and examination of several siblings suggested the diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Subsequent to improvement of the myoclonus the patient appeared to have the rigid form of Huntington's disease. This case represents a unique expression for an otherwise well defined genetic abnormality. Stimulus activated myoclonus in a common feature of a number of disorders of the nervous system. Intention, or action myoclonus has been the subject of increasing interest because of its association with the syndrome of post-anoxic encephalopathy (1), although it may occur with other disorders as well. Many abnormal movements have been reported in Huntington's disease, but myoclonus is a relatively uncommon feature of this disorder and to our knowledge intention myoclonus has not been reported as a major symptom. We recently have evaluated a patient with disabling intention myoclonus and examined several members of his family who have typical Huntington's disease. We therefore report this case, a unique presentation of an otherwise well described movement disturbance.", 
    "43": "Twenty paid healthy students volunteered for a doubleblind cross-over trial on the effects of two weeks' treatment with placebo, thioridazine and bromazepam on psychomotor skills. The doses used were thioridazine 10 mg t.i.d. during the first week and 20 mg t.i.d. during the second week, or 6 mg of bromazepam t.i.d. during two weeks choice reaction test, two co-ordination tests, a divided attention test, flicker fusion, and proprioception tests were used. The psychomotor skills were measured in the afternoon of the 7th and 14th day of each treatment, 30, 90 and 150 minutes after the second daily administration of the drug in combination with either an alcoholic or a placebo drink. There were no significant differences between the test weeks. Thioridazine alone resembled placebo and had no major combined effect with alcohol. Bromazepam impaired reactive and co-ordinative skills and attention deteriorated. The combination of bromazepam and alcohol potentiated the deterious effects of the single agents, and this effect was most remarkable at 30 minutes. The subjects also gave exaggerated responses in the proprioceptive tests. No significant alterations were recorded in the flicker fusion frequency after any treatment.", 
    "44": "Characteristics of hyperactive children, including speculation in regard to etiology, are reviewed. Drug effects studies and drug treatment of hyperactive behavior are examined, and unresolved issues are discussed. Conclusions indicate that individual differences in hyperative children should form the basis for treatment planning, rather than simply treating groups of children under the rubric \"hyperactivity.\"", 
    "45": "Chronic dietary administration of 6 different benzodiazepine tranquilizers (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, flurazepam, and nitrazepam) to breeding pairs of Swiss-Webster mice resulted in alterations of the normal patterns of reproductive behavior and fetal growth. Significant decreases in mating performance were seen among mice given diets containing 0.15% chlordiazepoxide, 0.05% diazepam, 0.05 and 0.15% oxazepam, 0.02 and 0.10% prazepam, 0.10% flurazepam, and 0.025% nitrazepam. Offspring in all drug treatments showed significantly depressed body weights at birth.", 
    "46": "A rational approach to the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is outlined. Patients suitable for treatment cannot be classified adequately using conventional diagnostic labels. They include those with primary symptoms of hypochondriasis, agoraphobia and social phobias, irritability, somatic anxiety and anergia; those with primary depressed mood, guilt, ideas of reference and personality disorders seldom respond. There is great variation in the interval between the first administration of these drugs and clinical response, and this may account for the inconsistencies in published trials. The type of drug and its dose may affect rate of response, as may biochemical factors, including acetylator and monoamine oxidase status. To obtain maximum benefit, a course of therapy with MAOIs should last for several months.", 
    "47": "A clinical comparison was made between a butyrophenone drug (haloperidol), and an established antianxiety agent of the benzodiazepine group (diazepam). Both drugs were highly effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, with few and mild side effects of diminishing intensity throughout the trial period.", 
    "48": "Data from a hospital-based drug surveillance programme were used to determine how often benzodiazepine drugs were used in general medical wards. Benzodiazepines were the drugs most commonly used as hypnotics and were given to 32% of these patients. Concomitant use of more than one benzodiazepine drug or of benzodiazepines with other psychoactive drugs was common and often irrational. A series of double-blind patient-preference studies comparing various benzodiazepines and a benzodiazepine with an antihistamine showed that for short-term hypnotic effect there were no differences between three common benzodiazepines but elderly patients preferred benzodiazepines to the antihistamine, which produced more undesired effects. These results suggest that currently diazepam is the hypnotic of choice for medical ward inpatients.", 
    "49": "A method is described which allows the assessment of discriminative stimulus properties of drugs, and the ability of amphetamine (0.16 mg/kg s.c.), chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg p.o.), desipramine (5 mg/kg s.c.), and haloperidol (0.02 mg/kg s.c.) to produce a discriminative stimulus complex (DSC) is evidenced. The method is found to yield clear-cut data that are specifically related to drug discrimination learning without being possibly confounded by state dependent effects. In addition, the experimental procedure is designed so as to provide an appropriate measurement of operant response modulating drug effects.", 
    "50": "Cyclic GMP levels were dose-dependently increased by excitatory drugs such as picrotoxin, pentetrazol, oxotremorine and harmaline in mouse cerebellum and medial forebrain (parts of the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum and midbrain) in vivo. Cyclic AMP levels remained unchanged under these conditions. Pretreatment with diazepam completely abolished the effect of picrotoxin and harmaline and significantly reduced the effects of pentetrazol and oxotremorine on cyclic GMP levels, but the tremor due to harmaline and oxotremorine was not blocked. Pretreatment with pentobarbital also prevented or strongly reduced changes in cyclic GMP levels elicited by excitatory drugs without abolishing the tremorigenic effects of harmaline and oxotremorine. Pretreatment with atropine was only effective in blocking cyclic GMP rise and tremor induced by oxotremorine and picrotoxin. Since pentobarbital and diazepam also decreased cyclic GMP levels in a dose-dependent manner in brains of control animals, the changes in cyclic GMP levels observed after administration of excitatory drugs appear to be related to the arousal reaction of the central nervous system.", 
    "51": "Electrical stimulations of the central and basolateral part of the amygdaloid complex and of the septum in freely moving cats elicit changes in arterial pressure (i.e., an increase in pressure during stimulation of the central part of the amygdala, and a decrease followed by an increase during stimulation of the basolateral part of the amygdala and of the septum). These changes within the cardiovascular system are followed by rage reactions when the central part of the amygdala is stimulated, defense patterns when the basolateral part of the amygdala is stimulated, and pitiful mewing as a result of septal stimulation. Medazepam hydrochloride in a dose of approximately 15 mg/kg i.v. given over a period of 3 h, in order to maintain constant blood levels of the drug, attenuated slightly the cardiovascular reactions and elevated markedly the thresholds for psychomotoric behavior. The latencies between the onset of electrical stimulation and the beginning of the increase in arterial pressure were only slightly increased, whereas the latencies for spychomotoric behavior were markedly prolonged due to drug application. The data support the view that medazepam hydrochloride exerts depressant effects on the limbic-hypothalamic level with respect to psychomotoric responses. The effect was not identical for all nuclei tested. The basolateral part of the amygdala was significantly less sensitive to medazepam hydrochloride than the central part of the amygdala.", 
    "52": "The influence of LD50 of lidocain by preliminary treatment with pethidin, aminophenazone or diazepam, respectively, is examined at the mouse. When pethidine is given within 1/100 to 1/10 of its LD50 develops a dose-dependent increase of toxicity for lidocaine. In 10 mg pethidin/kg the LD50 for lidocain decreases about the half. Under the conditions chosen amino phenazone and diazepam had no influence on the toxicity of lidocaine. It is referred to clinical aspects when pethidine and lidocain are simultaneously applied.", 
    "53": "Tests staged on non-anesthetized cats demonstrated that the symptoms of the inhibited behaviour of the animals following introduction of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are attended by hypertension, tachycardia and an increased intensity of pressor vasomotor reflexes. Urethan and chlorasole lessened the intensity of the activating effect of the tranquilizers on the central component of the sympathetic nervous system tonicity.", 
    "54": "The adverse effects in a series of 50 lumbar myelographies with Amipaque were compared with those in a corresponding series, examined with Dimer-X. Side effects occurred in 58% of the cases examined with Amipaque and in 68% of the Dimer-X series. No seizures occurred in 58% of the cases examined with Amipaque and in 68% of the Dimer-X series. No seizures occurred in either series but slight fibrillations of fasciculations appeared in 2 Dimer-X patients. Hyperreflexia of the legs was recorded in 22% of the Amipaque and in 36% of the Dimer-X cases. Other adverse reactions to the media were mild to moderate. Some burst activity, but no definite paroxysmal abnormality was noted in EEG recordings in 2 Amipaque cases. The low epileptogenicity of Amipaque has ensured a wider safety margin of lumbar myelography.", 
    "55": "A brief explanation of signal detection theory is presented, followed by a review of the literature in which differences in pain report were analyzed to determine if changes were in sensitivity (physiological processes) or in response bias (a subject's willingness to report that a signal occurred). Three kinds of studies are reviewed: modification, procedural, and comparative and normative. The advantages of using a signal detection approach in pain research are emphasized. It is concluded that experimenters applying signal detection analysis to pain research should give greater consideration to methodological procedures and be cognizant of all possibilities for shifts in sensitivity (d)'.", 
    "56": "Responding by three squirrel monkeys was maintained under multiple-and single-component 5-minute fixed-interval (FI) schedules of either food or electric shock presentation. Under the multiple schedule, a response after 5 minutes had elapsed produced either food or shock depending on the prevailing stimulus conditions; single-component FI schedules maintained responding either by food or shock presentation alone. Responding under either the food or the shock schedules was positively accelerated throughout each FI. During certain phases of the experiment, overall response rates maintained by foor were comparable to those maintained by shock. Alcohol (1.0-3.0 g/kg), chlordiazepoxide (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) increased responding maintained by food but decreased responding maintained by shock. These effects were obtained under both the multiple- and single-component schedules. Low to intermediate doses of cocaine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) increased responding maintained by either food or shock, whereas higher doses (3.0 mg/kg) generally decreased responding under these conditions. The effects of chlordiazepoxide were also studied with one monkey when response rates maintained by food or shock were equal, when rates of food-maintained responding were lower than those maintained by shock and, finally, when rates of responding maintained by food were higher than those maintained by shock. Under all of these conditions, chlordiazepoxide increased food-maintained response rates and decreased responding maintained by shock presentation.", 
    "57": "Amobarbital, diazepam, prochlorperazine and thioridazine were tested alone and in combination with d-amphetamine or mazindol on food consumption and spontaneous motor activity in rats. Of the four depressants tested (1) only amobarbital enhanced the anorexic effects of d-amphetamine and (2) amobarbital, diazepam and prochlorperazine enhanced the hypermotility induced by d-amphetamine. None of the depressants altered the anorexic effect of mazindol but amobarbital and diazepam decreased and prochlorperazine increased the hypermotility induced by mazindol. These differential effects of the CNS depressants suggest that d-amphetamine and mazindol might have different mechanisms of anorexiant or stimulatory action. The data also suggest that, to achieve anorexia with diminished CNS stimulation, combinations of d-amphetamine and any of the tested CNS depressants seem to be precluded. In fact, this desired clinical objective might be achieved with combinations of mazindol and either amobarbital or diazepam.", 
    "58": "The plasma protein binding of diazepam and of its main metabolite, N-demethyldiazepam, was measured in patients with renal disease and in healthy volunteers by ultracentrifugation. The total and non-protein bound concentrations of diazepam and N-demethyldiazepam, and the concentration of unconjugated oxazepam in the plasma were determined by gas chromatography after an oral 10 mg dose of diazepam. In the volunteers 98% of diazepam and N-demethyldiazepam were bound to the plasma proteins. In patients with renal disease the corresponding values were 92% and 95%, respectively. In the patients with renal disease no correlation could be found between the percent protein binding of diazepam or N-demethyldiazepam in the plasma and the serum creatinine concentration. Considerable variations in diazepam concentrations at 1 and 24 hours and in N-demethyldiazepam concentrations at 24 hours were found in the patients with renal disease. In contrast to the volunteers, 5 patients out of 28 with renal disease had measurable amounts of unconjugated oxazepam in the plasma. The deficient ability of the plasma proteins of patients with renal disease to bind diazepam may increase its clinical effect.", 
    "59": "1 In cats, anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, intravenous diazepam (minimum dose 3.0 mg/kg) enhanced dorsal root potentials but did not significantly diminish the reduction by electrophoretic strychnine of the inhibitory action of electrophoretic glycine on dorsal horn interneurones. 2 In mice, intraperitoneal diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) had no appreciable effect on the potency of strychnine as a convulsant, although providing some protection against bicuculline. 3 These observations, together with the failure of chlordiazepoxide to either inhibit the firing of spinal interneurones or reduce antagonism between strychnine and glycine when administered locally, provide no support for the interaction between benzodiazepines and mammalian central glycine receptors which has been proposed on the basis of in vitro studies of strychnine binding."
