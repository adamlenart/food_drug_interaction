Fall-risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) are known to increase fall risk and represent modifiable risk factors. There are limited data regarding the use of FRIDs in contemporary LTC and RH settings, and it has not been well documented to what extent medication regimens are reviewed and modified for those who have sustained falls. The objective of this study is to characterize medication related fall risk factors in LTC and RH residents and on-going use of medications known to increase fall risk.",

Residents in LTC were ostensibly at higher risk for falls relative to those in RH settings as suggested by higher proportion of residents with multiple falls, multiple comorbidities, comorbidities that increase fall risk and visual impairment. Post fall injuries were sustained by 42% of residents, and residents in RH sustained more injuries relative to LTC residents (47 vs 34%). Use of FRIDs such as benzodiazepines, antipsychotic, antidepressant and various antihypertensive drugs was common in the present sample.

    "4": "Tinnitus, a phantom sensation experienced by people around the world, currently is endured without a known cure. Some find the condition tolerable, while others are tortured on a daily basis from the incessant phantom noises. For those who seek treatment, oftentimes, they have a comorbid condition (e.g., depression, anxiety, insomnia), which is treated pharmaceutically. These products aim to reduce the comorbities associated with tinnitus thereby minimizing the overall burden present. Because of the phantom nature of tinnitus, it is often compared to neurologic pain. Since pain can be managed with pharmaceutical options, it is reasonable to assume that similar agents might work to alleviate tinnitus. The effects of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and glutamate antagonists are reviewed in this paper. Table 1 summarizes the pharmaceutical products discussed. Due to the variety of comorbid factors and potential causes of tinnitus, there may not be one pharmaceutical treatment that will combat every type of tinnitus. Nevertheless, a product that finally addresses the true cause of tinnitus, and not just its comorbidities, will benefit millions of people worldwide.",

However, the cancer cells often quickly develop an adaptive response to HER2 kinase inhibitors. We found that an epigenetic pathway involving MLL2 is crucial for growth of HER2(+) cells and MLL2 reduces sensitivity of the cancer cells to a HER2 inhibitor, lapatinib. Lapatinib-induced FOXO transcription factors, normally tumor-suppressing, paradoxically upregulate c-Myc epigenetically in concert with a cascade of MLL2-associating epigenetic regulators to dampen sensitivity of the cancer cells to lapatinib. An epigenetic inhibitor suppressing c-Myc synergizes with lapatinib to suppress cancer growth in vivo, partly by repressing the FOXO/c-Myc axis, unraveling an epigenetically regulated FOXO/c-Myc axis as a potential target to improve therapy.",

In the two animal models of seizures, the pretreatment of the IF (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) with flumazenil blocked the anticonvulsant effect, suggesting that the mechanism of action of this ester derived of ferulic acid may be related to activity in the benzodiazepine-binding site of the GABAA receptor (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, type A). In addition to the anticonvulsant effect, behavioral changes as neurotoxicity indication were assessed by using the rota rod and open field tests. The results obtained showed that the IF (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) does not induce significant changes in locomotor activity and motor coordination when compared with the control group, unlike the results presented by diazepam. Thus, these results demonstrate a new pharmacological knowledge of IF with potential application against epileptic seizures.

The present study sought to evaluate the significance of TSPO in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects induced by midazolam. The animals were administrated midazolam (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and subjected to behavioral tests, including Vogel-type conflict test, elevated plus-maze test, forced swimming test. Midazolam produced anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects Vogel-type conflict test (1 mg/kg, i.p.), elevated plus-maze test (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.), and forced swimming test (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.). These effects of Midazolam were totally blocked by the TSPO antagonist PK11195 (3 mg/kg, i.p.). To evaluate the role of allopregnanolone in the anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of midazolam, the animals were decapitated at the end of the behavioral tests. The allopregnanolone levels of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The allopregnanolone level of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was increased by midazolam (0.5, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and the increase was reversed by PK11195 (3 mg/kg, i.p.). Overall, the results indicated that the anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of midazolam were mediated by TSPO, via stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis.",

These drugs are often administered in the commission of drug facilitated sexual assaults due their effects on the central nervous system. Due to the potency of the drugs, only small amounts are usually given to victims; therefore, the target detection limit for these compounds in biological samples has been set at 50 ng/mL. Currently the standard screening method for detection of this class of drug is the immunoassay; however, screening methods that are more sensitive and selective than immunoassays are needed to encompass the wide range of structural variants of this class of compounds. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can be highly sensitive and has been shown to permit analysis of various benzodiazepines with limits of detection as low as 6 ng/mL. This technique permits analytical results in less than 2 min when used on pure drug samples. For biological samples, a key issue for analysis by SERS is removal of exogenous salts and matrix components. In this paper we examine supported liquid extraction as a useful preparation technique for SERS detection. Supported liquid extraction has many of the benefits of liquid-liquid extraction along with the ability to be automated. This technique provides a fast and clean extraction for benzodiazepines from urine at a pH of 5.0, and does not produce large quantities of solvent waste. To validate this procedure we have determined figures of merit and examined simulated urine samples prepared with commonly appearing interferences. It was shown that at a pH 5.0 many drugs that are prevalent in urine samples can be removed, permitting a selective detection of the benzodiazepine of interest. This technique has been shown to provide rapid (less than 20 min), sensitive, and specific detection of benzodiazepines with limits of detection between 32 and 600 ng/mL and dynamic range of 32-25,000 ng/mL. It provides the forensic community with a sensitive and specific screening technique for the detection of benzodiazepines in drug facilitated assault cases.",

    "71": "This prospective and randomized study was completed in the Department of Anesthesiology, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey between February 2013 and December 2014. Sixty patients undergoing elective hip surgery under spinal anesthesia in the geriatric age group with albumin levels below 3 g/dl were randomly divided into Group I and Group II. After administration of spinal block, Group I were given 0.05 mg/kg bolus midazolam, and then 0.02-0.1 mg/kg/hr dose infusion was begun. In Group II, 1 mg/kg bolus propofol was given within 10 minutes, and then 1-3 mg/kg/hr infusion was begun. The systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation values, respiratory rate, and Wilson's 5-stage sedation score were recorded at 15-minute intervals. At the end of the operation, the recovery time and surgeon satisfaction were recorded.", 
    "72": "The recovery times for patients in Group I were found to be longer than in Group II (p less than 0.05). The respiration rate in patients in Group I at the start of surgery, 15th minute of surgery, and after surgery were lower than in Group II (p less than 0.05).", 
    "73": "We conclude that propofol is more reliable in terms of hemodynamic stability than midazolam, as it causes less respiratory depression and faster recovery in the propofol group.",

Among them, 44.6% (463) had seizures in the acute phase, 33% had status epilepticus, and 26% (251) developed postencephalitic epilepsy. At one year of follow-up, 205 of the 251 patients with postencephalitic epilepsy were receiving antiepileptic drugs while 18% were seizure free even after discontinuing the antiepileptic drugs. Among those with postencephalitic epilepsy, 67% had favorable outcomes and were using <2 anti-epileptic drugs while 15% had intractable seizures and were using \u2265 2 antiepileptic drugs. After benzodiazepines, intravenous phenobarbital was preferred over phenytoin as treatment of postencephalitic seizures in the acute phase. For refractory status epilepticus, high-dose topiramate combined with intravenous high-dose phenobarbital or high-dose lidocaine had less side effects.",

The model is compared with a two-compartment model using experimental data from studies using wild-type and HRN mice. This comparison allowed for metabolic differences between the two types of mice to be isolated. The three sets of drug data (Gefitinib, Midazolam and Thalidomide) showed that the transgenic mouse has a decreased rate of metabolism.",

After 3'-dA treatment, the phosphorylation and synaptic localization of the AMPA receptors GluR1 and GluR2 were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP). The traditional antidepressant imipramine was applied as a positive control.", 
    "81": "We found that an injection of 3'-dA led to a rapid and robust antidepressant effect, which was significantly faster and stronger than imipramine, after 45min in tail suspension and forced swim tests. This antidepressant effect remained after 5 days of treatment with 3'-dA. Unlike the psycho-stimulants, 3'-dA did not show a hyperactive effect in the open field test. After 45min or 5 days of treatment, 3'-dA enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation in both the PFC and HIP. In addition, after 45min of treatment, 3'-dA significantly up-regulated GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2 levels, at the synapses in the PFC. After 5 days of treatment, 3'-dA significantly enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2, at the synapses in the PFC and HIP. Moreover, the AMPA-specific antagonist GYKI 52466 was able to block the rapid antidepressant effects of 3'-dA.",

    "83": "The translocator protein (TSPO), previously designated as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is an evolutionary conserved protein that is found in many Eukarya, Archae, and Bacteria, in which it plays several important functions including for example membrane biogenesis, signaling, and stress response. A tspo homolog gene has been identified in several members of the Pseudomonas genus, among which the soil bacterium P. fluorescens Pf0-1. In this bacterium, the tspo gene is located in the vicinity of a putative hybrid histidine kinase-encoding gene. Since tspo has been involved in water stress related response in plants, we explored the effects of hyperosmolarity and temperature on P. fluorescens Pf0-1 tspo expression using a strategy based on lux-reporter fusions. We show that the two genes Pfl01_2810 and tspo are co-transcribed forming a transcription unit. The expression of this operon is growth phase-dependent and is increased in response to high concentrations of NaCl, sucrose and to a D-cycloserine treatment, which are conditions leading to activity of the major cell wall stress responsive extracytoplasmic sigma factor AlgU. Interestingly, the promoter region activity is strongly lowered in a P. aeruginosa algU mutant, suggesting that AlgU may be involved at least partly in the molecular mechanism leading to Pfl01_2810-tspo expression. In silico analysis of this promoter region failed to detect an AlgU consensus binding site; however, a putative binding site for the heat shock response RpoH sigma factor was detected. Accordingly, the promoter activity of the region containing this sequence is increased in response to high growth temperature and slightly lowered in a P. aeruginosa rpoH mutant strain. Taken together, our data suggest that P. fluorescens tspo gene may belong at least partly to the cell wall stress response.",

The decrease in the frequency of heroin/morphine deaths since 1997 (71%) continued, declining to 44% in 2002, 33% in 2007 and finally to 27% in 2012. Few deaths from central stimulants (amphetamine and cocaine) occurred. Multiple drug use was common and consisted mainly of opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis, benzodiazepines and alcohol. Heroin/morphine use was most frequent on Funen and in South Jutland. Cocaine was most frequently detected in East Denmark, while amphetamine was more frequent in West Denmark.", 
    "87": "The number of fatal poisonings among drug addicts has stabilised around 200. The increase in methadone deaths continued and, as in 2007, methadone was the main intoxicant. The increase in methadone deaths seems to be associated with use of methadone in substitution treatment. Nevertheless, methadone treatment also seems to save lives, as indicated by the increasing median age. Use of antidepressants and antipsychotics increased to a high level compared with 2007, indicating that a considerable number of drug addicts also have psychiatric illness.",

    "96": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(11;14) that leads to constitutive expression of cyclin D1, a master regulator of the G1-S phase. Chk1 inhibitors have been recently shown to be strongly effective as single agents in MCL. To investigate molecular mechanisms at the basis of Chk1 inhibitor activity, a MCL cell line resistant to the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 (JEKO-1 R) was obtained and characterized. The JEKO-1 R cell line was cross resistant to another Chk1 inhibitor (AZD-7762) and to the Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775. It displayed a shorter doubling time than parental cell line, likely due to a faster S phase. Cyclin D1 expression levels were decreased in resistant cell line and its re-overexpression partially re-established PF-00477736 sensitivity. Gene expression profiling showed an enrichment in gene sets involved in pro-survival pathways in JEKO-1 R. Dasatinib treatment partly restored PF-00477736 sensitivity in resistant cells suggesting that the pharmacological interference of pro-survival pathways can overcome the resistance to Chk1 inhibitors. These data further corroborate the involvement of the t(11;14) in cellular sensitivity to Chk1 inhibitors, fostering the clinical testing of Chk1 inhibitors as single agents in MCL.",

The contextual fear memory of the miSE mice was also significantly increased and that of miSE treated with MDL returned to the normal level. The parvalbumin-positive GABA neurons were decreased in number by pIC+PILO which was rescued by MDL. Apoptosis marker ssDNA-positive cells were increased by pIC+PILO which could not be rescued by MDL. Therefore, we propose that BZP-dependent therapy for SE needs to be rethought from the perspective of using other treatment approaches.",

Thirty years ago, we demonstrated in experimental animals the interaction of melatonin with central BZD receptors, and in 1997 we published the first series of elderly patients who reduced BZP consumption after melatonin treatment. Almost every single neuron in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the central pacemaker of the circadian system, contains \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and many results in animals point out to a melatonin interaction with GABA-containing neurons. In addition, central-type BZD antagonism, that obliterates GABAA receptor function, blunted most behavioral effects of melatonin including sleep. Melatonin is involved in the regulation of human sleep. This is supported by the temporal relationship between the rise of plasma melatonin levels and sleep propensity as well as by the sleep-promoting effects of exogenously administered melatonin. Both meta-analyses and consensus agreements give support to the therapeutic use of melatonin in sleep disorders. This action is attributed to MT1 and MT2 melatoninergic receptors localized in the SCN, as well as in other brain areas. This review discusses available data on the efficacy of melatonin to curtail chronic BZD/Z drug use in insomnia patients. A major advantage is that melatonin has a very safe profile, it is usually remarkably well tolerated and, in some studies, it has been administered to patients at very large doses and for long periods of time, without any potentiality of abuse. Further studies on this application of melatonin are warranted.",

In this study, we replicated a prior examination of the period prevalence of prazosin use as a function of distance from Puget Sound, Washington, where prazosin was first tested as an effective treatment for PTSD and where prazosin use was previously shown to be much greater than in other parts of the United States. We tested the following three hypotheses related to prazosin geographic diffusion: (1) a positive geographical correlation exists between the distance from Puget Sound and the proportion of users treated according to a guideline recommended minimum therapeutic target dose (>/=6 mg/d), (2) an inverse geographic correlation exists between prazosin and benzodiazepine use, and (3) no geographical correlation exists between prazosin use and serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI) use. Among a national sample of veterans with PTSD, overall prazosin utilization increased from 5.5 to 14.8% from 2006 to 2012. During this time period, rates at the Puget Sound VHA location declined from 34.4 to 29.9%, whereas utilization rates at locations a minimum of 2,500 miles away increased from 3.0 to 12.8%. Rates of minimum target dosing fell from 42.6 to 34.6% at the Puget Sound location. In contrast, at distances of at least 2,500 miles from Puget Sound, minimum threshold dosing rates remained stable (range, 18.6 to 17.7%). No discernible association was demonstrated between SSRI/SNRI or benzodiazepine utilization and the geographic distance from Puget Sound. Minimal threshold dosing of prazosin correlated positively with increased diffusion of prazosin use, but there was still a distance diffusion gradient. Although prazosin adoption has improved, geographic differences persist in both prescribing rates and minimum target dosing. Importantly, these regional disparities appear to be limited to prazosin prescribing and are not meaningfully correlated with SSRI/SNRI and benzodiazepine use as indicators of PTSD prescribing quality.",

A total of 40 rats were randomly divided into 2 groups; the control and olanzapine groups (N = 20 per group). The control rats were fed regular food, while the olanzapine rats received olanzapine-enriched (1.2 mg/kg) food by gavage for 4 weeks to establish the olanzapine-induced obese rat model. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Serum glucose content was measured by biochemical colorimetry. Learning and memory capacity was measured using a Y-maze, and the time before escape from a Morris water maze was recorded. Body weight and levels of blood glucose, lipids, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CRP increased in the olanzapine group. In addition, the number of shocks received before reaching the learning and memory standard and the time before escape from the Morris water maze were higher in the olanzapine group than in the control group.

However, only limited data are available on the dynamic changes that occur in myelinated fibers, oligodendrocytes (which are myelin-forming cells), and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are a reservoir of new oligodendrocytes, in the hippocampus throughout epileptogenesis. The current study was designed to examine this issue using a rat model of lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG), immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis showed that the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the rat hippocampus began during the acute stage of epileptogenesis, and the severity of this loss increased throughout epileptogenesis. Accompanying this loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes, OPCs in the rat hippocampus became activated and their populations increased during several phases of epileptogenesis (the acute, latent and chronic phases). The transcription factors olig1 and olig2, which play crucial roles in regulating OPC proliferation, differentiation and remyelination, were up-regulated during the early phases (the acute and latent phases) followed by a sharp decline in their expression during the chronic and late chronic phases. This study is the first to confirm the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes during lithium-pilocarpine-induced epileptogenesis accompanied by a transient increase in the number of OPCs. Prevention of the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes may provide a novel treatment strategy for epilepsy.",

Although targeting of CSCs offers great promise for the new generation of therapeutics, lack of the effective drugable target and appropriate pharmacological reagents significantly impedes the development of chemotherapies. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of BMK1 was significantly correlated with not only embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, but also the CSCs. It was showed that activation of BMK1 by the expression of MEK5D enhanced the self-renew (sphere formation), proliferation (clone formation) and tumorigenic capacity of CSCs. While BMK1 inhibitor, XMD8-92, suppressed these capacities. RNA-seq and microarray analysis revealed that inhibition of BMK1 significantly enhanced the expression of BNIP3 and BNIP3L, which play important roles in cell death. Further study indicated that shRNA-mediated knock down of BNIP3 and BNIP3L impairs the BMK1 inhibitor, XMD8-92-induced suppression of sphere formation and clone formation of CSC. Collectively, these results not only indicate that BMK1 plays an important role in maintaining \"stemness\" of CSCs, but also implicate that BMK1 might be a potential drug target for CSCs.",

The sample consisted of 955 patients with OCD from a comprehensive, cross-sectional, multicentre study conducted by the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders between 2003 and 2009. The rate of BDZ use over time in this OCD sample was 38.4%. Of individuals taking BDZs, 96.7% used them in combination with other medications, usually serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The most commonly used BDZ was clonazepam. Current age, current level of anxiety and number of additional medications for OCD taken over time significantly predicted BDZ use. This is the first study to comprehensively examine BDZ use in OCD patients, demonstrating that it is relatively common, despite recommendations from treatment guidelines. Use of BDZs in combination with several other medications over time and in patients with marked anxiety suggests that OCD patients taking BDZs may be more complex and more difficult to manage. This calls for further research and clarification of the role of BDZs in the treatment of OCD.",

We previously reported that this anesthetic mixture produced closely similar anesthetic effects in BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains. We also demonstrated the efficacy of atipamezole (ATI), an antagonist of MED that produced quick recovery from anesthesia in mice. Anesthetics have various anesthetic effects among animal strains. However, the differences in the effects of anesthetic mixtures in rats are unclear. In the present study, we first examined effects of the abovementioned anesthetic mixture using three different rat strains: Wistar (WST), Sprague-Dawley (SD), and Fischer 344 (F344). Second, we examined how different dosages and optimum injection timing of ATI affected recovery from anesthesia in rats. We used the anesthetic score to measure anesthetic duration and a pulse oximeter to monitor vital signs. We found no significant differences in anesthetic duration among the three different strains. However, recovery from anesthesia in the SD strain took significantly longer than in the other strains. The antagonistic effects of ATI (0.15 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg) were equivalent when administered at 30 min after anesthetic mixture administration. The antagonistic effects of ATI 0.75 mg/kg were stronger than those of ATI 0.15 mg/kg at 10 min after anesthetic mixture administration. This anesthetic mixture is a useful drug that can induce similar anesthetic effects in three different strains and has an antagonist, ATI, that makes rats quickly recover from anesthesia. These results may contribute to the welfare of laboratory animals.",

To explore the underlying mechanism, we investigated the effects of PXT on cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)-mediated MDZ metabolic pathways using rat liver microsomes (RLM), human liver microsomes (HLM), and rat primary hepatocytes. In the presence of PXT, the Vmax of 4-OH MDZ decreased from 0.72 to 0.51\u2009nmol/min\u00b7mg pro in RLM and from 0.32 to 0.12\u2009nmol/min\u00b7mg pro in HLM, and the Km value increased from 5.12 to 7.26\u2009\u00b5M in RLM and from 27.87 to 32.80\u2009\u00b5M in HLM. But the presence of PXT reduced the Km and increased the Vmax values of MDZ 1'-hydroxylation in RLM and HLM. Interestingly, the differential effect of PXT on MDZ 4-hydroxylation and 1'-hydroxylation was also observed in primary rat hepatocytes after 45-min culture. PXT did not affect the expression levels of CYP3A1/2 mRNA in rat hepatocytes. With extension of the culture time to 6\u2009h, however, PXT significantly inhibited both MDZ 4-hydroxylation and 1'-hydroxylation, and the expression level of CYP3A1/2 mRNA was decreased to 87% and 80% (CYP3A1) and to 89% and 85% (CYP3A2) of those in controls in the presence of PXT 4.0 and 8.0\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively. These results suggest that PXT could activate MDZ 1'-hydroxylation but inhibit MDZ 4-hydroxylation by changing the CYP3A enzyme affinity and metabolic rate after a short-term intervention. However, long-term treatment with PXT could inhibit both the 4-hydroxylation and 1'-hydroxylation of MDZ by downregulating CYP3A1/2 mRNA expression.", 
    "134": "Suicidality is a common problem in the general hospital. Patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders or during a psychosocial crisis can develop suicidal ideation during their stay at the general hospital, especially if they suffer from chronic disease. Some somatic disorders, such as cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, stroke and chronic pain conditions are associated with an increased risk of suicide. The fact that (1) a major part of patients are treated in the emergency room (ER) after a suicide attempt and (2) a suicide attempt is the strongest predictor for later completed suicide emphasizes the importance of expertise in dealing with suicidal patients in the ER. In order to improve prevention of suicides and suicide attempts within the general hospital and after discharge it is important to educate staff concerning suicidality and enhance detection of suicidal patients. A consultation and liaison psychiatrist should always be involved when there are suicidal patients on wards and in the ER. Assessment of suicidal patients has always to include clear recommendations concerning patient safety and treatment of the underlying condition as well as specific approaches in dealing with suicidal thoughts. Safety measures can include close monitoring, constant observation, restriction to means of suicide, referral to a psychiatric clinic and treatment with sedatives, generally benzodiazepines. Psychiatric disorders are ideally treated according to guidelines and clear recommendations should be given concerning treatment after discharge. Specific psychotherapy for suicidal behaviour possibly reduces the risk of future suicides. A special situation is created by assisted suicides which attribute to suicides in the elderly with a recent increase in the Swiss population. In some cases, undiagnosed depression may contribute to the decision making process, hence, underlining the importance of improved detection and treatment of depression in the elderly.",

International guidelines recommend the treatment of breakthrough CINV with an agent from a drug class that was not used in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen and recommend using the breakthrough medication continuously rather than using it on an as needed basis. There have been very few studies on the treatment of breakthrough CINV. A recent double-blind, randomized, phase III study suggested that olanzapine may be an effective agent for the treatment of breakthrough CINV. Refractory CINV occurs when patients develop CINV during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy when antiemetic prophylaxis has not been successful in controlling CINV in earlier cycles. Patients who develop refractory CINV should be considered for a change in their prophylactic antiemetic regimen. If significant anxiety exists, a benzodiazepine may be added to the prophylactic regimen. If a refractory patient is receiving HEC, olanzapine may be added to the prophylactic regimen.

The aim of this study was to compare the different central inhibitory effects between S-(-) ornidazole and R-(+) ornidazole in mice and clarify the possible mechanisms. In the present study, central effects of ornidazole were evaluated by open-field test and rota-rod test, and such effects were reversed by pre-treatment with flumazenil (i.p., 10\u00a0mg/kg) suggesting that ornidazole exhibits such action by interacting with the GABAergic system. Then, the functional difference between S-(-) ornidazole and R-(+) ornidazole was further explored by evaluating the contents of glutamate (Glu) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, and Western blot was used to measure glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67) expression in the mice cerebral cortex. We found that R-(+) ornidazole mediated an increase in GABA level while decreased the level of glutamate through upregulation of GAD65/67 in the cerebral cortex.

All samples were 2 ml vials with yellowish fluid. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was performed first to analyze the samples semi-quantitatively and the quantitative levels of components were then explored using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TLC revealed steroid (in form of betamethasone), heroin, codeine, morphine and thebaine in all five samples. Four samples contained acetaminophen and two samples contained caffeine. None of them contained amphetamine, benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant, aspirin, barbiturates, tramadol and buprenorphine. HPLC revealed that heroin, codeine, morphine and thebaine constituted the narcotic foundation in all samples. In addition, the heroin to acetylcodeine ratio was significantly lower in three samples, which indicates their higher toxicity. The results of the present study on the chemical components of Norjizak showed that this substance is an opiate one similar to heroin and the heroin-based crack prevalent in Iran which contains betamethasone.",

    "209": "Adaptation of the nervous system to different chemical and physiologic conditions is important for the homeostasis of brain processes and for learning and remembering appropriate responses to challenges. Although processes such as tolerance and dependence to various drugs of abuse have been known for a long time, it was recently discovered that even a single pharmacologically relevant dose of various drugs of abuse induces neuroplasticity in selected neuronal populations, such as the dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area, which persist long after the drug has been excreted. Prolonged (self-) administration of drugs induces gene expression, neurochemical, neurophysiological, and structural changes in many brain cell populations. These region-specific changes correlate with addiction, drug intake, and conditioned drugs effects, such as cue- or stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. In rodents, adolescent drug exposure often causes significantly more behavioral changes later in adulthood than a corresponding exposure in adults. Clinically the most impairing and devastating effects on the brain are produced by alcohol during fetal development. In adult recreational drug users or in medicated patients, it has been difficult to find persistent functional or behavioral changes, suggesting that heavy exposure to drugs of abuse is needed for neurotoxicity and for persistent emotional and cognitive alterations.

Stress increased the locomotor activity and time spent in the bottom area of the tank (novel tank). Fluoxetine and diazepam prevented these behaviors. We also observed that stress and fluoxetine and diazepam exposures decreased social interaction. Stress also increased aggressive behavior, which was not reversed by fluoxetine or diazepam.

    "217": "The neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety are of paramount importance to the development of effective therapeutic treatments. To date, there is considerable pharmacological evidence suggesting that the suppression of hippocampal theta frequency is a robust and predictive assay of anxiolytic drug action. Recently, this idea has been challenged using histamine (2-(4-imidazolyl)ethanamine), an endogenous neurotransmitter involved in a number of brain and behavioral functions. Here, we systematically evaluate the effects of dorsal and ventral hippocampal histamine infusions on evoked theta frequency and behavioral anxiety. Given the complex pharmacological profile of histamine and its receptors in the hippocampus, we reasoned that local intra-hippocampal infusions would be a powerful test of the theta suppression model. While dorsal hippocampal infusions of histamine produced neither significant changes in anxious-like behavior in the elevated plus maze nor changes of evoked theta, ventral infusions of histamine produced potent behavioral anxiolysis which corresponded to an increase, and not a decrease, in evoked theta frequency. As a positive neurophysiological control, we demonstrated that diazepam, a proven anxiolytic drug, decreased the frequency of hippocampal theta following both dorsal and ventral hippocampal infusions. Our results further challenge the hippocampal theta frequency suppression model as a measure of anxiolytic drug action. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Histamine Receptors'.",

The biomarkers 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol (4\u03b2HC) and 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol (6\u03b2HCL) are sensitive to CYP3A induction and inhibition. However, their utility for the assessment of constitutive CYP3A activity remains uncertain. We investigated whether endogenous plasma biomarkers (4\u03b2HC and 6\u03b2HCL) are associated with basal CYP3A metabolic activity in healthy subjects assessed by a convenient single-time-point oral midazolam (MDZ) phenotyping strategy. Plasma 4\u03b2HC and 6\u03b2HCL metabolic ratios (MRs) were analysed in 51 healthy adult participants. CYP3A activity was determined after administration of an oral MDZ microdose (100 \u03bcg). Simple linear and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between MDZ oral clearance, biomarkers and subject covariates. Among study subjects, basal MDZ oral clearance, 4\u03b2HC and 6\u03b2HCL MRs ranged 6.5-, 10- and 13-fold, respectively. Participant age and alcohol consumption were negatively associated with MDZ oral clearance (p = 0.03 and p = 0.045, respectively), while weight and female sex were associated with lower plasma 4\u03b2HC MR (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.032, respectively). Neither 4\u03b2HC nor 6\u03b2HCL MRs were associated with MDZ oral clearance. Plasma 4\u03b2HC and 6\u03b2HCL MRs do not relate to MDZ single-time-point metabolic phenotype in the assessment of constitutive CYP3A activity among healthy individuals.", 
    "224": "Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) presents with minimal seizure activity clinically, but with evidence on EEG. It is a recognised cause of delirium in older people, but prevalence estimates vary widely. As delirium is a common presentation in older people and because NCSE is potentially reversible, an improved diagnostic ability in this group could be highly beneficial. EEG testing is required to make a definitive diagnosis, but this may be difficult due to access to testing, patient adherence and result interpretation. NCSE has two commonly recognised forms: complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) and absence status epilepticus (ASE). Clinical features associated with NCSE in older people presenting with confusion include a reduction in level of arousal; aphasia or interrupted speech; myoclonus or subtle jerking; staring; automatisms; perseveration or echolalia; increased tone; nystagmus or eye deviation; emotional lability; disinhibition and anosagnosia. Risk factors include female sex, a history of epilepsy or a tonic-clonic seizure around the time of onset, and recent discontinuation of benzodiazepines. A practical approach to the diagnosis of NCSE in older people is suggested based upon the presence of clinical features suggestive of NCSE and local access to EEG testing.", 
    "225": "Nausea and vomiting are distressing and relatively common symptoms in palliative care populations. Adequate control may be difficult to achieve, requiring multiple agents. Although a growing literature supports the use of olanzapine in management of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, the published literature in palliative care populations is less extensive.", 
    "226": "The study objective was to assess the efficacy of olanzapine in the management of difficult to control nausea and vomiting in a palliative care patient population.", 
    "227": "Patients whose nausea and vomiting had not responded adequately to other antiemetics were treated with olanzapine 5mg as a single dose at night. Treatment was considered to be successful if the patient reported an adequate improvement in their symptoms. Duration of observed treatment ranged from three days to five months.", 
    "228": "Sixteen patients were treated with an evaluable outcome in 14. Of these, 13 reported a self-evaluated adequate ongoing improvement in their symptoms. One patient experienced no relief and one other experienced a return of nausea after two weeks; this patient requested a change of treatment due to unacceptable sedative effects. There were no other reports of significant adverse events.", 
    "229": "Olanzapine provided adequate, ongoing relief of nausea and vomiting with an acceptable adverse effect profile in 13 of 14 evaluable patients. Particularly in comparison with metoclopramide and haloperidol, olanzapine should be considered for first-line therapy for nausea and vomiting in this population. Further evaluation of dose ranging and safety is required.", 
    "230": "Antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) are associated with symptoms of schizophrenia, leading to the hypothesis that NMDA-R hypofunction leads to the pathogenesis of disease. We evaluated the long-term effect of neuroleptic administration on the NMDA subunits via immunohistochemical analysis.", 
    "231": "Rats received olanzapine, clozapine and haloperidol before evaluation of the expression of the NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunit proteins in the hippocampal areas of the brain, via a densytometric analysis of immunoexpression in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "232": "All of the neuroleptics examined caused a decrease in the expression of the NR1 subunit, and thus, one can assume that both olanzapine, clozapine and haloperidol decreased the number of NMDA receptors in the CA1 and CA2 areas of the brain.", 
    "233": "A decrease in hippocampal glutamatergic signalling after long-term neuroleptic administration may cautiously explain the incomplete effectiveness of these drugs in the therapy of schizophrenia-related cognitive disturbances.", 
    "234": "A 13-year-old girl presented to a private office for dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia. The patient had a previous uneventful anesthetic 5 years prior in the same office by another dental anesthesiologist. The patient was highly anxious and would not allow monitors placed prior to induction. After an uneventful mask induction with sevoflurane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen, monitors were placed and a 22-gauge intravenous cannula inserted. The initial rhythm on the electrocardiogram was trigeminy interspersed with normal sinus rhythm. The volatile anesthetic sevoflurane was discontinued immediately, and intravenous anesthesia was started but still the patient was consistently entering trigeminy. The patient was always hemodynamically stable and never hypoxic. An in-depth discussion of the case and discussion of ventricular dysrhythmias is presented.", 
    "235": "The study investigated patient discharge parameters and postdischarge adverse events after discharge among children who received oral conscious sedation for dental treatment. This prospective study involved 51 patients needing dental treatment under oral conscious sedation. Each patient received one of various regimens involving combinations of a narcotic (ie, morphine or meperidine), a sedative-hypnotic (ie, chloral hydrate), a benzodiazepine (ie, midazolam or diazepam), and/or an antihistamine (ie, hydroxyzine HCl). Nitrous oxide and local anesthesia were used in conjunction with all regimens. After written informed consent was obtained, each guardian was contacted by phone with specific questions in regard to adverse events following the dental appointment. Out of 51 sedation visits, 46 were utilized for analysis including 23 boys and 23 girls ranging from 2 years 2 months to 10 years old (mean 5.8 years). 60.1% of patients slept in the car on the way home, while 21.4% of that group was difficult to awaken upon reaching home. At home, 76.1% of patients slept; furthermore, 85.7% of patients who napped following the dental visit slept longer than usual. After the appointment, 19.6% exhibited nausea, 10.1% vomited, and 7.0% experienced a fever. A return to normal behavior was reported as follows: 17.4% in <2 hours, 39.1% in 2-6 hours, 28.3% in 6-10 hours, and 15.2% in >10 hours. Postdischarge excessive somnolence, nausea, and emesis were frequent complications. The time to normality ranged until the following morning demonstrating the importance of careful postdischarge adult supervision.", 
    "236": "The title compound, C12H18N2\u00b70.5H2O, crystallizes with two independent organic mol-ecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit, together with a water mol-ecule of crystallization. The diazepine rings in each mol-ecule have a chair conformation. The dihedral angle between benzene ring and the mean plane of the diazepine ring is 21.15\u2005(12)\u00b0 in mol-ecule A and 17.42\u2005(11)\u00b0 in mol-ecule B. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by N-H\u22efO and O-H\u22efN hydrogen bonds, forming zigzag chains propagating along [001].", 
    "237": "Risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI), the first licensed, long-acting second-generation antipsychotic (SGA), has not yet been studied in terms of its effectiveness compared with first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) LAIs.", 
    "238": "The differences in the effectiveness of RLAI and two other FGA LAIs, haloperidol and flupentixol, were assessed by conducting a one-year pre-post study based on the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. Effectiveness was defined as reduced medical care utilization and relapse prevention.", 
    "239": "A decreased number of relapses were identified in the haloperidol injection group in the post-LAI period than in the pre-LAI period (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p<0.05). The RLAI group had the largest number of acute admissions and relapses, the longest duration of admission (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p<0.005), and the lowest utilization of anticholinergic agents, such as benzodiazepine (BZD) and SGAs (except oral risperidone), among all of the LAI groups in the post-LAI period.", 
    "240": "According to the results of this observational study, we suggest that the effectiveness of RLAI is not superior to that of FGA (haloperidol or flupentixol) LAIs, but that RLAI might have fewer adverse effects.", 
    "241": "We reviewed the available pharmacological therapies for alcohol use disorder in Japan. For treatment of withdrawal delirium, therapists prefer to use antipsychotic drugs rather than benzodiazepines, which is different from other countries. Japan does not have any substantial treatment guidelines for withdrawal delirium. Therefore, so treatment strategies matching the environment of each facility need to be formulated. Moreover, current choices for prescribing anti-alcoholic drugs to cope with alcohol craving are limited to drugs such as cyanamide and disulfiram. However, the use of acamprosate has recently begun and a clinical trial for nalmefene is starting soon. We anticipate that these newer pharmacological therapies will contribute to better treatment of alcohol use disorder also in Japan.", 
    "242": "Benzodiazepines are widely used as anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping drugs. On the other hand, it is also true that use disorders such as abuse or dependence is often a problem. Including the distinctive usual dose depends on the BZ drugs use disorders, I outlined the actual situation, diagnostic criteria, and the treatment.", 
    "243": "Nationwide surveys to clarify the characteristics and trends of the addictive disorders and behaviors including alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence, internet addiction and pathological gambling among Japanese adults were carried out in 2003, 2008, and 2013. At the part of the surveys on addictive behaviors in disaster stricken area by the Great East Japan Earthquake, the nationwide survey on benzodiazepine dependence was conducted in 2013. Epidemiological features of prevalent addictive disorders and behaviors were described. We observed large number of estimated patients with addictive disorders or behaviors in Japan, and the considerable proportion of them was not connect to appropriate medical services.", 
    "244": "Drugs of abuse testing is used in various areas of society for detection and follow-up of drug use. In routine laboratory drug testing, immunoassays are employed for initial screening of specimens to indicate the presence of drugs. To confirm a positive screening test, a secondary analysis by mass spectrometry is performed. The \"cut-off\" is the pre-defined concentration threshold of a drug or drug metabolite above which the sample is considered positive. A reading below this level implies a negative test result. Swedish drug testing laboratories currently employ varying cut-offs to distinguish between a positive and a negative test result. Because a positive drug test may have serious legal consequences to the individual, it is of importance that testing is performed and judged equally, regardless of where it is performed. A national harmonization of cut-offs is therefore warranted. Based on data from four major Swedish drug testing laboratories, and considering the recommendations in international guidelines, a proposal for national harmonization of urine cut-offs for the most common set of drugs of abuse is presented."
