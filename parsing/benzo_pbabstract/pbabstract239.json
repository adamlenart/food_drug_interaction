    "1": "One hundred and forty-one patients attending for elective DC cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias were randomized to intravenous midazolam or diazepam. Sedation was administered using titration protocols. Procedure times, operator satisfaction scores and adverse events were documented. The patients immediate, 24- and 48-h recall and awareness of after-effects were obtained from questionnaires. Seventy-one patients received midazolam (mean 12.5 mg) and 70 patients received diazepam (mean 28.1 mg). There were 16 minor adverse events with midazolam (20% hypotension, 3% oxygen desaturation) and nine with diazepam (7% hypotension, 6% required additional analgesia), P = 0.14. There were no major adverse events. Sedation time was 5.0 +/- 3.4 min for midazolam and 6.5 +/- 3.4 min for diazepam (P = 0.0016). Patients awoke 77 +/- 46 min post-sedation with midazolam and 39 +/- 24 min with diazepam (P < 0.0001). There was no recall of the procedure at 48 h and no difference in awareness of after-effects between the two groups at 24 or 48 h, P = ns.",

    "3": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and extent of irreversible tissue damage as well as the time course of extracellular concentration of amino acids, substrates of energy metabolism, and purine metabolites, intracranial pressure and tissue oxygen tension were assessed in 34 patients with large strokes covering more than 50% of the MCA territory. The results were compared to findings in the experimental model of transient (for 3 hours) MCA occlusion in cats. In the experimental model as well as in the clinical setting development of malignant brain infarcts (due to formation of space occupying brain edema) was predicted by the size of critically hypoperfused tissue and the volume of irreversibly damaged tissue. The course of malignant infarcts was characterized by progressive increase in concentrations of excitatory amino acids, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, hypoxanthine and in intracranial pressure, while cerebral perfusion pressure and tissue oxygen tension decreased. These results clearly differentiate a malignant from a benign course of large hemispheric infarction. The methods can be used to identify patients at risk for formation of space occupying edema and to select patients who could benefit from invasive therapeutic strategies.", 
    "4": "Measurement of the adenosine A1 receptor (A1-R) with positron emission tomography (PET) using a newly developed positron ligand, [1-methyl-11C]8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-methyl-3-propylxanthine (MPDX). were performed in a cat middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and reperfusion. Eighteen adult cats underwent PET measurement of; 1) cerebral blood flow (CBF). 2) A1-R, 3) central benzodiazepine receptor (BDZ-R) and 4) glucose metabolism with 15O labeled water, MPDX, 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), respectively. The CBF, A1-R, BDZ-R and FDG uptake were serially measured after 60 min occlusion of MCA in this order. MPDX binding and FMZ binding, but not CBF and FDG uptake, were significantly reduced in the groups with severer ischemic insult than in the groups with no or milder insults. Of the two receptor ligands, the reduction rate of the MPDX binding to A1-Rs was larger in a group that caused fatal ischemic insult. The newly developed PET in vivo imaging technique using MPDX was suitable in evaluating the function of adenosine and A1-Rs in relation to cerebral ischemia.",

    "6": "Six healthy young male volunteers served as the subjects. They were asked to take triazolam (0.25 mg), zopiclone (7.5 mg) or placebo at noon time (13:00) and sleep for 1 h. Simulated flight performances were tested in a simulator 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 b, 8 h, 10 h and 20 h (next morning 9:00) after taking the drugs. The experiments were done once a week for 3 weeks.",

    "9": "In this paper, the anti-coagulant rodenticide-human serum albumin (HSA) binding was investigated using a perturbation method to calculate the solute distribution isotherms. It was shown that rodenticide can bound either on the benzodiazepine HSA site with low affinity (site I) or on the warfarin HSA site with high affinity (site II). The thermodynamic parameters of this association were calculated for the two HSA binding sites. For the site II, the rodenticide-HSA association was governed enthalpically whereas for the site I, this one was driven entropically. Moreover, the role of the magnesium (Mg(2+)) and calcium (Ca(2+)) on this association was carried out. It was clearly demonstrated that the rodenticide affinity for the site I was not affected by modifying the bulk solvent surface tension whereas for the site II the association constant increased strongly with the Mg(2+) or the Ca(2+) concentration in the bulk solvent. These results showed that the rodenticide-HSA affinity and thus the rodenticide toxicological effect depends on the Mg(2+) or Ca(2+) concentration.", 
    "10": "Split spinal cord malformations (SCM) typically present in childhood and rarely in adulthood. Very little is known about the SCMs in the elderly, and the diagnosis can be easily missed. A 73-year-old woman with a childhood history of scoliosis and late ambulation milestones presented with a 2-year history of worsening low back pain and progressive difficulty walking. She had a mild gait disturbance with 4/5 weakness in left ankle dorsiflexion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a bifid spinal cord contained in a single thecal sac and a tethered cord with low-lying conus at L3. The patient was taken to the operating room and a soft-tissue median septum, as well as all other adhesions, was removed. The filum terminale was identified, coagulated, and divided. Six weeks later, the patient reported decreased back pain, improvement in ambulation, and markedly decreased used of narcotics for her back and leg pain. Her left ankle dorsiflexion strength improved to 4+/5. This patient had two hemicords encased in a single dural tube separated by a nonrigid, fibrous median septum and an associated tethered cord. Adult presentation of SCM is extremely rare. This case highlights the need to consider split cord malformation and tethered cord in the differential diagnosis not only for adults but also the elderly presenting with back pain, scoliosis, and difficulty walking.", 
    "11": "We have recently reported the presence of the anxiolytic flavone 6-methylapigenin (MA) and of the sedative and sleep-enhancing flavanone glycoside 2S (-) hesperidin (HN) in Valeriana officinalis and Valeriana wallichii. MA, in turn, was able to potentiate the sleep-inducing properties of HN. The present paper reports the identification in V. officinalis of the flavone glycoside linarin (LN) and the discovery that it has, like HN, sedative and sleep-enhancing properties that are potentiated by simultaneous administration of valerenic acid (VA). These effects should be taken into account when considering the pharmacological actions of valeriana extracts.", 
    "12": "The effect of rose oil inhalation (1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0% w/w) on the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test was investigated in adult male rats and compared with the effect of diazepam (DZP) (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally 30 min before testing. Exposure to rose oil produced an anxiolytic-like effect similar to DZP (anxiolytic reference drug). Thus, at some concentrations, rose oil significantly increased the number of visits to and time spent in the open arms of the EPM. Anxiolytic-like properties of rose oil were observed using the EPM, being consistent with other behavioral and clinical studies.", 
    "13": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine compared with fluphenazine in the treatment of patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. This was a long-term (22-week), randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trial. Sixty patients (mean age, 35.4 years) were randomly assigned to either olanzapine (n=30) or fluphenazine (n=30). They received treatment at three centers in Croatia during a 22-week study period and were assessed weekly for the first 6 weeks and monthly thereafter. Efficacy was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Rating Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity and Improvement scores. The Hillside Akathisia Scale (HAS), Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), vital signs, laboratory tests, and treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed to evaluate safety. The olanzapine group showed significantly greater mean decreases from baseline to endpoint for BPRS total (-25.8 vs. -16.5, P=.035), PANSS total (-45.7 vs. -29.5, P=.037), PANSS positive (-13.0 vs. -7.9, P=.034), and CGI Severity (-2.2 vs. -1.3, P=.031) scores. The olanzapine group showed greater mean decreases on all measures of extrapyramidal symptoms, significantly so for the SAS (-2.1 vs. 1.9, P=.004) and HAS (-3.4 vs. 2.6, P=.028). Patients in the fluphenazine group experienced a higher incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (76.7% vs. 50.0%, P=.032). Weight gain was the most frequently reported adverse event in the olanzapine group (16.7% vs. 0.0%, P=.020). Akathisia (30.0% vs. 10.0%, P=.053) and insomnia (20.0% vs. 0.0%, P=.010) appeared most frequent in the fluphenazine group. Daily use of anticholinergics and benzodiazepines were both significantly greater for the fluphenazine group (P=.003 and.04, respectively). No significant changes were observed in vital signs, ECG, or clinical chemistry. The study indicates that olanzapine has advantages in both efficacy and safety compared to fluphenazine; however, the small sample size limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions.", 
    "14": "As a follow up of our previous structure-activity relationship and molecular modeling studies, we synthesized a novel series of 1-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives as potential non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonists. When tested for their ability to prevent sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice, some of these novel compounds showed high anticonvulsant potency.", 
    "15": "During the last few years, several case reports and studies have been published on the potential diabetes mellitus (DM)-inducing effect of some atypical antipsychotics, especially clozapine and olanzapine. The purpose of our study was to evaluate diabetogenic effects of atypical antipsychotics in the literature. In order to give a full-scale overview, both peer-reviewed publications and oral and poster presentations on this subject were screened. We found 27 case reports of new-onset DM for clozapine, 39 for olanzapine, 4 for risperidone, and 3 for quetiapine. Related to the year of introduction of these drugs on the market and the number of treatment days of each drug during the last 6 years in 13 western countries, Brazil, and Japan, the cases show an over-representation of cases related to olanzapine and clozapine. In the majority of cases, risk factors (DM family history, obesity, Negroid ethnicity) were present. Eighty-four percent of the cases arose in patients < 50 years, in contrast to the general population (most cases, > 50 years). Comparative epidemiological studies point in the same direction, with two studies showing no differences between the atypical drugs. Antipsychotic agents are used often for treatment of schizophrenia, a condition that appears to be associated with DM also in untreated subjects. Some antipsychotics appear to induce new-onset diabetes mellitus. In view of the health risks of DM and the predisposition in patients with schizophrenia, it is advised to be cautious with prescription of antipsychotics that are associated with new-onset DM. Especially in predisposed patients (family history of DM, obese, Negroid ethnicity), reticence in this respect is required. Moreover, careful monitoring of weight, BMI, and glucose levels is advised both before these antipsychotics are prescribed and during treatment.", 
    "16": "Echinacea is a widely available over-the-counter herbal remedy. Tinctures of echinacea have been shown to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) in vitro. The effect of echinacea (Echinacea purpurea root) on CYP activity in vivo was assessed by use of the CYP probe drugs caffeine (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (hepatic and intestinal CYP3A).", 
    "17": "Twelve healthy subjects (6 men) completed this 2-period, open-label, fixed-schedule study. Caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and oral and intravenous midazolam were administered before and after a short course of echinacea (400 mg 4 times a day for 8 days) to determine in vivo CYP activities.", 
    "18": "Echinacea administration significantly increased the systemic clearance of midazolam by 34%, from 32 +/- 7 L/h to 43 +/- 16 L/h (P =.003; 90% confidence interval [CI], 116%-150%), and significantly reduced the midazolam area under the concentration-time curve by 23%, from 127 +/- 36 microg. h/L to 102 +/- 43 microg. h/L (P =.024; 90% CI, 63%-88%). In contrast, the oral clearance of midazolam was not significantly altered (P =.655; 90% CI, 75%-124%), 137 +/- 19 L/h compared with 146 +/- 71 L/h. The oral availability of midazolam after echinacea dosing was significantly increased (P =.028; 90% CI, 108%-153%), from 0.23 +/- 0.06 to 0.33 +/- 0.13. Hepatic availability (0.72 +/- 0.08 versus 0.61 +/- 0.16; P =.006; 90% CI, 73%-90%) and intestinal availability (0.33 +/- 0.11 versus 0.61 +/- 0.38; P =.015; 90% CI, 125%-203%) were significantly altered in opposite directions. Echinacea dosing significantly reduced the oral clearance of caffeine, from 6.6 +/- 3.8 L/h to 4.9 +/- 2.3 L/h (P =.049; 90% CI, 58%-96%). The oral clearance of tolbutamide was reduced by 11%, from 0.81 +/- 0.18 L/h to 0.72 +/- 0.19 L/h, but this change was not considered to be clinically relevant because the 90% CIs were within the 80% to 125% range. The oral clearance of dextromethorphan in 11 CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers was not affected by echinacea dosing (1289 +/- 414 L/h compared with 1281 +/- 483 L/h; P =.732; 90% CI, 89%-108%).", 
    "19": "Echinacea (E purpurea root) reduced the oral clearance of substrates of CYP1A2 but not the oral clearance of substrates of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Echinacea selectively modulates the catalytic activity of CYP3A at hepatic and intestinal sites. The type of drug interaction observed between echinacea and other CYP3A substrates will be dependent on the relative extraction of drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites. Caution should be used when echinacea is coadministered with drugs dependent on CYP3A or CYP1A2 for their elimination.", 
    "20": "In lamina II of the spinal dorsal horn, synaptic inhibition mediated by ionotropic GABA(A) and glycine receptors contributes to the integration of peripheral nociceptive messages. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed from lamina II neurons in spinal cord slices to study the properties of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) mediated by activation of GABA(A) and glycine receptors in immature (<30 d) and adult rats. Blockade of neurosteroidogenesis by 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195), an inhibitor of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), or finasteride, which blocks 5alpha-reductase, accelerated the decay kinetics of GABA(A) receptor-mediated mIPSCs in immature, but not in adult animals. Glycine receptor-mediated mIPSCs remained unaffected under these conditions. These results suggest the presence of a tonic production of 5alpha-reduced neurosteroids in young rats that confers slow decay kinetics to GABA(A) mIPSCs. At all of the ages, selective stimulation of PBR by diazepam in the presence of flumazenil prolonged GABA(A) mIPSCs in a PK11195- and finasteride-sensitive manner. This condition also increased the proportion of mixed GABA(A)/glycine mIPSCs in the immature animals and led to the reappearance of mixed GABA(A)/glycine mIPSCs in the adult. Our results might point to an original mechanism by which the strength of synaptic inhibition can be adjusted locally in the CNS during development and under physiological and/or pathological conditions by controlling the synthesis of endogenous 5alpha-reduced neurosteroids.", 
    "21": "Pregnenolone is the major steroid precursor in humans. It is also a \"neurosteroid\" and possesses intrinsic behavioral and brain effects in animals, affecting the GABA(A) and other receptors. In two preliminary studies, we sought to characterize its tolerability and psychotropic effects in humans. In Study 1, 17 normal volunteers received pregnenolone and placebo for 4 weeks each (15 mg PO per day x2 weeks followed by 30 mg PO per day x2 weeks, vs. placebo x4 weeks) in a within-subject, double-blind, cross-over design, with a 4 week drug-free washout period separating the two arms. Subjects' behavioral responses were assessed at the beginning and end of the 4-week pregnenolone arm and the 4-week placebo arm. Pregnenolone was generally well-tolerated but, by itself, had no significant effects on mood, memory, self-rated sleep quality or subjective well-being. In Study 2, 11 subjects from Study 1 received a single dose of diazepam (0.2 mg/kg PO) immediately following completion of Study 1 in order to assess, in a between groups design, the impact of 4-weeks' pre-treatment with pregnenolone (N=5) vs. placebo (N=6) on the acute sedative, amnestic and anxiolytic effects of this benzodiazepine. Pregnenolone-pretreated subjects showed significantly less sedation following diazepam (p<0.03); this effect was clinically apparent. Diazepam's amnestic effects were non-significantly attenuated, and ratings of anxiety were unaffected. These pilot data, based on small samples, raise the possibility that chronically administered pregnenolone antagonizes certain acute effects of benzodiazepines and may enhance arousal via antagonist or inverse agonist actions at the benzodiazepine/GABA(A) receptor complex. Further larger-scale studies, utilizing a broader range of doses and experimental conditions, are warranted.", 
    "22": "The primary objectives of the present study were to establish whether there was a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between the probe drugs caffeine (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), debrisoquine (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1) and midazolam (CYP3A4), when administered in combination as a cocktail. Furthermore, the tolerability of these probe drugs, both alone and in combination as a cocktail was assessed.",

The randomization was such that all drugs were given individually followed by the full \"cocktail\" as the last treatment limb. The phenotypic index used to assess the intrinsic activity of the CYP isoforms included metabolite/parent ratios in plasma and urine (CYPs 1A2, 2E1 & 2C9), parent/metabolite ratios in urine (CYP2D6) and plasma AUClast (CYP3A4). Blood pressure and blood glucose measurements were used to assess pharmacodynamic interactions. Tolerability was assessed through reporting of adverse events",

The ratio of the geometric mean (and 90% confidence interval) of the phenotypic index, obtained after administration of the probe as part of the cocktail and when given alone were: caffeine, 0.86 (0.67-1.10), midazolam, 0.96 (0.74-1.24), tolbutamide, 0.86 (0.72-1.03), debrisoquine 1.04 (0.97-1.12) and chlorzoxazone, 0.95 (0.86-1.05). There was no difference in blood pressure and blood glucose concentrations following the cocktail and dosing of the individual probes. There was no effect on ECG recordings at any time-point. The adverse events reported for individual drug administrations were mild, transient and expected. Overall no more adverse events were reported on the cocktail study days than on the days when the drugs were administered alone.", 
    "25": "The five probe drugs when coadministered, in this dosing regimen, demonstrated no evidence of either a metabolic or pharmacodynamic interaction that might confound the conclusions drawn during a cocktail study. The present cocktail methodology has the potential to become a useful tool to aid the detection of clinically important drug-drug interactions during drug development.",

Procedural sedation and analgesia was performed in the standard manner, with the addition of bispectral index monitoring and simultaneous clinical sedation scoring (modified Ramsay Sedation Scale [range 1 to 8; 1=alert, 8=unresponsive]). Paired bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale scores were assigned every 5 minutes during the sedation. Ramsay Sedation Scale scores were assigned by a single study investigator blinded to the bispectral index score. An emergency physician independently administered all medications for procedural sedation and analgesia. The correlation between the paired bispectral index/Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was determined by using a repeated-measures regression analysis.

    "43": "Recently, we have reported studies in rats showing that the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (OLZ), in contrast to haloperidol (HAL), was not associated with reduction of markers of central cholinergic neurons as well as decrements in cognitive performance after chronic exposure. We compared the effect of 45 day chronic exposure of HAL (2 mg/kg per day) to OLZ (10 mg/kg per day) on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) and its high affinity receptor TrkB in rat hippocampus. Since the use of OLZ is presently preferred over HAL in patients, effects of its post-treatment on HAL-induced changes in the expression of BDNF and its TrkB receptor were also investigated. OLZ was administered after 45 days of HAL exposure. HAL, but not OLZ, significantly reduced the levels of BDNF in hippocampus. These changes in BDNF paralleled the levels of TrkB receptors. Furthermore, post-treatment with OLZ markedly restored the HAL treatment associated reductions in both BDNF and TrkB receptors in hippocampus.",

Adult male rats were treated repeatedly with either vehicle or MP subcutaneously (3 mg/kg/day) and observed for the signs of toxicity during the treatment period. The toxic sign, tremor, reached maximum right after 9th injection in MP-treated rats, and declined thereafter. Animals were sacrificed and brains were taken 1 week or 3 weeks after the daily treatment for measurement of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and binding of radioligands, [3H]QNB (nonselective), [3H]pirenzepine (M1-selective), and [3H]AF-DX384 (M2-selective) to muscarinic receptors. With this treatment regimen, the AChE activity in the blood dropped quickly and maintained at 30% of the control level after 6 injections. After 3 weeks of treatment, MP caused 80-90% AChE inhibition and substantial reductions in [3H]QNB binding (9-33%), [3H]pirenzepine binding (9-22%) and [3H]AF-DX384 binding (6-38%) in different brain regions, including striatum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, thalamus and midbrain. After 1 week of treatment, the inhibition of AChE in brain regions was from 54 to 74%, whereas receptor densities were only marginally affected in a few regions. The timing of the changes in receptor population correlates well with the changes in behaviors during the repeated MP exposure. Our findings suggest that down-regulation of muscarinic receptors plays a role in the development of tolerance to MP. And, the regulations of muscarinic receptors were different among receptor subtypes and brain regions.", 
    "54": "5-(3-methoxyphenyl)-3-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridine (AC-3933) is a novel cognitive enhancer with central benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonistic activity. AC-3933 is predominantly metabolized to hydroxylated metabolite [SX-5745; 3-(5-hydroxymethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridine] in dog. Initially, we found that there is considerable interindividual variability in AC-3933 hydroxylation in dogs and that dogs could be phenotyped as extensive metabolizer (EM) and poor metabolizer (PM). Then, to clarify the cause of AC-3933 polymorphic hydroxylation in dogs, in vitro studies were carried out using liver microsomes from EM and PM dogs. Our results show that AC-3933 hydroxylation clearance in PM dogs was much lower than that in EM dogs (0.2 versus 10.8-20.5 microl/min/mg, respectively). In addition, AC-3933 hydroxylation was significantly inhibited by alpha-naphthoflavone, a CYP1A inhibitor, and by anti-CYP1A2 antibodies, indicating that CYP1A2 was responsible for the polymorphic hydroxylation of AC-3933 in dogs. Furthermore, immunoblotting results have shown that although CYP1A2 protein was not detected in PM dogs (<0.86 pmol/mg), CYP1A2 content in EM dogs was prominent (6.1-13.0 pmol/mg). These results indicate that AC-3933 polymorphic hydroxylation arises from the polymorphic expression of CYP1A2 in dogs, which might involve genetic polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene.", 
    "55": "In vitro studies of enantioselective metabolism of R-(+)- and S-(-)verapamil (VER) were conducted using human cDNA-expressed CYP3A isoforms, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. N-dealkylated products nor-VER [2,8-bis-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropyl-6-azaoctanitrile] and D617 [2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylamino-2-isopropylvaleronitrile] were the major metabolites for all CYP3A isoforms regardless of enantiomer. Enantioselectivity of CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 was most similar among the three isoforms. This coincides with the degree of homology of amino acids at the active sites and in the total amino acid sequences of the enzymes. Biphasic substrate inhibition was observed for the formation of nor-VER and D617, whereas simple biphasic kinetics were observed for the formation of O-demethylated products for both enantiomers with CYP3A4. The biphasic substrate inhibition was observed only for nor-VER, and simple biphasic kinetics were observed for D617 and O-demethylated products for both enantiomers with CYP3A5. However, with CYP3A7, D617 and O-demethylated products showed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and only nor-VER displayed substrate (monophasic) inhibition. When metabolic rates of VER were determined in the presence of three different effectors, midazolam, testosterone, and nifedipine, activation, inhibition, or activation and inhibition of VER metabolism was observed depending on the enantiomers, metabolites, effectors, and cytochrome P450 isoforms. Addition of anti-CYP3A4 antibody inhibited formation of all metabolites for both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The atypical phenomena (biphasic substrate inhibition, activation, and inhibition depending on product formation) of VER kinetics could be adequately explained by introducing the concept of steric interaction into a two binding-site model.",

The two first electroencephalograms (EEGs) showed continuous diffuse spikes, rhythmic sharp waves and sharp-and-slow wave complexes which were completely abolished after the administration of 10 mg of intravenous diazepam. Over the following days, the clinical state of the patient was unmodified despite aggressive antiepileptic therapy. A third EEG revealed pseudo-periodic negative or positive-negative slow waves localised in the right frontal region. Subsequently, two consecutive EEGs showed continuous periodic generalised bi-triphasic complexes at a rate of 1 Hz, compatible with the diagnosis of CJD. Finally, the patient died, and postmortem examination was diagnostic of the sporadic form of CJD.",

Whereas the knockout mice have provided information primarily with respect to the regulation of subunit gene transcription, receptor assembly, and some physiological functions of individual receptor subtypes, the point-mutated knockin mice in which specific GABAA receptor subtypes are insensitive to diazepam or some general anesthetics have revealed the specific contribution of individual receptor subtypes to the pharmacological spectrum of diazepam and general anesthetics.", 
    "65": "Traditional theories of forgetting are wedded to the notion that cue-overload interference procedures (often involving the A-B, A-C list-learning paradigm) capture the most important elements of forgetting in everyday life. However, findings from a century of work in psychology, psychopharmacology, and neuroscience converge on the notion that such procedures may pertain mainly to forgetting in the laboratory and that everyday forgetting is attributable to an altogether different form of interference. According to this idea, recently formed memories that have not yet had a chance to consolidate are vulnerable to the interfering force of mental activity and memory formation (even if the interfering activity is not similar to the previously learned material). This account helps to explain why sleep, alcohol, and benzodiazepines all improve memory for a recently learned list, and it is consistent with recent work on the variables that affect the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",

At postnatal day 90, rats were tested during acquisition of the submerged platform version of the Morris water maze task using four systemic doses of muscimol (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 1.8 mg/kg i.p.) or three systemic doses of CL218,872 (1.0, 3.2, and 5.6 mg/kg i.p.). In a dose dependent manner both drugs impaired acquisition of the task and impaired accuracy of the search pattern on the probe trial (platform removed). However, neither drug dissociated the performance of the two nutritional groups. These data are important in light of previous findings of differential behavioral effects of the non-specific BZ agonist, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), on spatial learning and on drug discrimination in prenatally malnourished rats and in the context of previous findings of reduced sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of non-specific BZ receptor agonists across a wide variety of models of malnutrition. The present findings also support the concept that prenatal malnutrition does not affect the global functioning of the GABAA receptor, but fundamentally alters the way in which a subset of GABAA receptors (i.e. those containing the alpha2, alpha3 and/or the alpha5 but not the alpha1 subunit) is modulated by BZs.",

    "81": "Corticotropin-releasing factor(1) (CRF(1)) antagonists may be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders with fewer side effects compared with classic benzodiazepines. The behavioral effects of DMP904 [4-(3-pentylamino)-2,7-dimethyl-8-(2-methyl-4-methoxyphenyl)-pyrazolo-[1,5-a]-pyrimidine] and its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were related to its levels in plasma and estimated occupancy of central CRF(1) receptors. DMP904 (10-30 mg/kg, p.o.) and alprazolam (10 mg/kg, p.o.) increased time spent in open arms of an elevated-plus maze. In addition, acutely or chronically (14 days) administered DMP904 (1.0-30 mg/kg, p.o.) and acute alprazolam (1.0-3.0 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced exit latency in the defensive withdrawal model of anxiety in rats, suggesting that tolerance may not develop to the anxiolytic-like effects of DMP904 in this model of anxiety. Acutely, DMP904 reversed the stress-induced increase in plasma corticosterone levels in defensive withdrawal at doses of 3.0 mg/kg and higher. These doses also resulted in levels of DMP904 in plasma similar to (for anxiolytic-like effects) or 4-fold higher (for effects on the HPA axis) than the in vitro IC(50) value for binding affinity at CRF(1) receptors and greater than 50% occupancy of CRF(1) receptors. Unlike alprazolam, DMP904 did not produce sedation, ataxia, or chlordiazepoxide-like subjective effects (as measured by locomotor activity, rotorod performance, and chlordiazepoxide discrimination assays, respectively) at doses at least 3-fold higher than anxiolytic-like doses. In conclusion, anxiolytic-like effects and effects on the stress-activated HPA axis of DMP904 in the defensive withdrawal model of anxiety required 50% or greater occupancy of central CRF(1) receptors. This level of CRF(1) receptor occupancy resulted in fewer motoric side effects compared with classic benzodiazepines.", 
    "82": "We evaluated the effect of age on CYP3A expression and function in the liver, intestine, and kidney from young (3-4 months), intermediate (13-14 months), and old (25-26 months) male Fischer-344 rats. The biotransformation of triazolam to its primary hydroxylated products, 4-OH-TRZ (triazolam) and alpha-OH-TRZ, was used as a marker of CYP3A activity in rat liver and intestine. Immunoactive CYP3A expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis in the rat intestine, liver, and kidney. Since testosterone and NADPH reductase levels may modulate CYP3A activity, we also examined free plasma testosterone concentrations and NADPH reductase expression in these rats. The effect of age on CYP3A expression was tissue-specific. Although both CYP3A activity and expression were reduced by approximately 50 to 70% in the old livers compared with the young animals, intestinal CYP3A activity and expression did not change significantly with age. The expression of one CYP3A isoform was increased by 1.5-fold in the old kidneys. NADPH reductase expression was reduced by 23 to 36% with age in all tissues; this reached statistical significance only in the liver. Plasma testosterone levels declined by 74% in the old animals. This study suggests that the effect of age on CYP3A expression and function is tissue-specific. In addition, changes in testosterone levels and NADPH reductase expression may contribute to age-related differences in hepatic CYP3A activity.", 
    "83": "The discriminative stimulus effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) can be mimicked by GABA(A) receptor-positive modulators (e.g., diazepam) and GABA(B) receptor agonists (e.g., baclofen). The purposes of this study were to see whether stimulus control could be established with baclofen and to further characterize the role of GABAergic mechanisms in the behavioral actions of GHB by evaluating GHB and related compounds in rats discriminating either diazepam or baclofen. Training criteria were satisfied with baclofen and diazepam after 69 and 44 sessions, respectively. GHB and its precursors gamma-butyrolactone and 1,4-butanediol occasioned >80% responding on the drug-associated lever in rats discriminating baclofen and <11% in rats discriminating diazepam. Diazepam and other GABA(A) receptor-positive modulators occasioned intermediate levels of responding on the baclofen lever, whereas baclofen occasioned less than 4% responding on the diazepam lever. The GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 35348 [(3-aminopropyl)(diethoxymethyl) phosphinic acid] partially antagonized the effects of baclofen as well as the baclofen-like effects of GHB, and flumazenil partially antagonized the effects of diazepam. This study established stimulus control with baclofen, and substitution data provided direct evidence for a role of GABAergic, especially GABA(B), mechanisms in the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB. The lack of substitution by GHB or its metabolic precursors for diazepam indicates a comparatively smaller role of GABA(A) mechanisms in these effects of GHB. The inability of CGP 35348 to completely attenuate the effects of baclofen and GHB suggests that multiple receptors could be involved in the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB.",

A circular skin area was irradiated with UVB-light 20 h before the application of gabapentin (600 mg) and 2 h later remifentanil (0.08 microg.kg(-1).min(-1), 40 min). In the sunburn spots we observed stable decreases of the heat pain perception thresholds (HPPT, mean difference, 4.45 degrees C; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.32 degrees -5.59 degrees ) and heat pain tolerance thresholds (HPTT; mean difference, 5.43 degrees C; 95% CI, 4.50 degrees -6.35 degrees ) compared with normal skin. Further, large areas of mechanical hyperalgesia to pinprick adjacent to the erythema spots developed in all subjects. Overall remifentanil increased the HPPT (mean increase, 2.47 degrees C; 95% CI, 1.86 degrees -3.09 degrees, P < 0.001) and HPTT (mean increase, 3.18 degrees C; 95% CI, 2.65 degrees -3.71 degrees, P < 0.001) and reduced the area of secondary hyperalgesia by 59% (mean decrease, 5326 mm(2); 95% CI, 4233-6419 mm(2), P < 0.001) compared with placebo. In the sunburn remifentanil markedly increased the HPTT by 86% compared with normal skin (additional increase, 2.57 degrees C; 95% CI, 1.71 degrees -3.43 degrees). This different effect was not seen in the HPPT. With the exception of a small increase of HPTT in the sunburn (P = 0.02) gabapentin had no noticeable effect on either hyperalgesia. In conclusion, opioid analgesia was reliably demonstrated in this new extended pain model.",

    "86": "1. The inhibitory effects of various test compounds on recombinant human CYP3A4 activity assayed by fluorescent metabolite formation from 7-benzyloxyquinoline (7-BQ) and the effect of pre-incubation on inhibition were evaluated using the microtitre plate assay with multiple concentrations of test compounds (multiple concentration method). 2. Among the test compounds studied, ketoconazole inhibited CYP3A4 activity most extensively, followed by miconazole, troleandomycin, terfenazine and midazolam. The IC(50) values of other compounds exceeded 10 microM, but those of many compounds decreased after pre-incubation. The inhibitory effects of verapamil, amiodarone and diltiazem after pre-incubation were 205, 154 and 833 times greater than those in the case of co-incubation, respectively. 3. To assess the inhibitory effects more readily, the validity of the microtitre plate assay with a single concentration of the test compound (single concentration method) was studied. The accuracy of the automated dispensation and the coefficient of variation on enzyme activity were approximately 3%. 4. The IC(50) values estimated using the per cent of residual activity from the single concentration method matched closely those from the multiple concentration method. When the IC(50) value as inhibitor concentration was used for a single concentration method, the method enabled easy estimation of inhibitory patterns (such as competitive or time-dependent inhibition) on cytochromes P450. Therefore, from the ease of the technique, automation of the microtitre plate assay and application of the single concentration method might be useful for inhibitory assessment of cytochromes P450 more than that of current conventional methods.", 
    "87": "When neuronal activity is abnormally suppressed during the developmental period of synaptogenesis, the timing and sequence of synaptic connections is disrupted, and this causes nerve cells to receive an internal signal to commit suicide, a form of cell death known as \"apoptosis\". By altering glutamate and GABA transmission alcohol suppresses neuronal activity, causing millions of nerve cells to commit suicide in the developing brain. This proapoptotic effect of alcohol provides a likely explanation for the diminished brain size and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human fetal alcohol syndrome. These findings have public health significance, not only in relation to fetal alcohol syndrome, but also in relation to several other drugs of abuse and various drugs used in obstetric and pediatric medicine, because these additional drugs (e.g. phencyclidine, ketamine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates) also suppress neuronal activity and drive developing neurons to commit suicide.",

Four types of rat CCK-AR cDNAs were transfected into CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells: normal CCK-AR cDNA transfected cells (wild type, WT); K120 substituted with V; K130V; and R352V. Binding of [3H]CCK-8 was observed in WT and K130V, but not in K120V and R352V. CCK caused Ca(2+) spiking in WT and K130V, whereas K120V and R352V had no effect. Three chimeras including the CCK-AR/3ibeta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR), 3Nibeta2AR, and 3Cibeta2AR were constructed. Two groups of point mutations in the CCK-AR3i were also made: Y252V, S274V, S281V, and S289V (non-phospho-acceptor Y or S); S260V, S264V, S271V, and S275V (phospho-acceptor S). WT and CCK-AR/3Cibeta2AR increased [Ca(2+)](i) in response to CCK; 3Nibeta2AR was vice versa. CCK failed to increase [IP(3)] in phospho-acceptor S to V without affecting binding. Non-phospho-acceptor S or Y to V showed normal response. Thus, Lys120 outside the TM2 and Arg352 outside the TM6 of the CCK-AR are amino acids interacting with Tyr[SO(3)H]27 and Asp32 of the CCK peptide for binding. Phospho-acceptor Ser groups in the CCK-AR 3Ni are amino acids for initiating cell signaling.", 
    "89": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor is an important pharmacological target of ethanol. The effect of ethanol withdrawal on the expression of the alpha(2) subunit of this receptor was examined with rat cerebellar granule cells in primary culture. Long-term exposure of these cells to ethanol (100 mM, 5 days) did not affect the abundance of the mRNA for the alpha(2) subunit, as revealed by an RNase protection assay. In contrast, subsequent ethanol withdrawal for 3 h induced a marked increase in the amount of this mRNA (2.6-fold) as well as in that of the encoded polypeptide (2.2-fold), the latter revealed by immunoblot analysis. Exposure of the cells to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (100 mM) during ethanol withdrawal prevented the increase in the amounts of both the alpha(2) mRNA and polypeptide, whereas similar treatment with diazepam (10 microM) blocked the increase in the abundance of the alpha(2) polypeptide but not that in the amount of the alpha(2) mRNA. The effect of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid was not blocked by the competitive GABA(B) receptor antagonist SCH 50911(10 microM). Given that the alpha(2) subunit of the GABA(A) receptor mediates the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines, its up-regulation during discontinuation of long-term ethanol exposure might be relevant to the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of anxiety associated with ethanol withdrawal.",

Twenty-one hospitalized patients, aged 6088 yr, with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were being treated with typical neuroleptic medication were switched to olanzapine. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) Scale were completed while patients were on their previous medication regimen and again 6 months after the last patient had been started on olanzapine. The mean duration of treatment was 289 d (S.D.=139). Three patients discontinued the medication. Mean end dose of olanzapine was 12.9 mg (S.D.=5.7). Paired sample t tests were used to test change on PANSS Positive, Negative and Total scales, CGI, GDS and body weight. PANSS (Positive, p=0.002; Negative, p=0.003; General, p=0.003; and Total, p=0.000) and CGI (p=0.000) but not the GDS (p=0.67) demonstrated statistically significant improvement.

A community pediatrician called for assistance opened a bulla, which impressively improved the symptoms and avoided the necessity of an admission to hospital.

    "97": "Chlordiazepoxide is a sedative-hypnotic drug widely employed as a transquilizer and anti-depressant. Its electrochemical behavior in Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffers of pH 2-11 at a mercury electrode has been investigated using dc-polarography, cyclic voltammetry and controlled-potential coulometry. Polarograms of the drug in B-R buffers of pH 2-10 exhibited three 2-electron waves, while at pH>10, only a single 4-electron wave was observed. The first, second, and third waves in buffers of pH<or=10 may be attributed to the reduction of N-oxide, C=N and C=N centers, respectively. The single wave (pH>10) may be due to the reduction of both the N-oxide and C=N centers in a one step. The shift of the E(1/2,) values to more negative potentials upon the increase of pH indicated the involvement of protons in the electrode reaction and that the proton-transfer reaction precedes the electrode process proper. The estimated data indicated that, one proton and two electrons are participated in the rate-determining step of each of the reduced centers. The general sequence of chlordiazepoxide reduction processes via each of its reactant centers may be expressed as: H(+), e, e, H(+)((fast)).Based on the interfacial adsorptive character of the drug onto the mercury electrode, a validated direct square-wave adsorptive cathodic stripping (SWAdCS) voltammetric procedure has been described for the trace determination of the drug in bulk form, tablets and human serum. The procedure did not require sample pretreatment or time-consuming extraction or evaporation steps prior to the assay of the drug. The optimized operational conditions of the proposed procedure have been found to be: accumulation potential E(acc.)=-0.9 V, accumulation time t(acc.)=30s, pulse-amplitude=50 mV, scan increment=10 mV and frequency=120 Hz. The proposed procedure is much more simple, fast, sensitive, costly low and achieved much more lower limits of detection (LOD) (4.4 x 10(-10)M and 6.6 x 10(-10)M) and limits of quantitation (LOQ) (1.5 x 10(-9)M and 2.2 x 10(-9)M), respectively in pharmaceutical formulation and spiked human serum, compared to previously reported methods.",

In this paper, we report that mutating serine 171 within gamma2 to glycine or cysteine prevents the interaction of gamma2 with alpha2 and beta1 when these subunits are co-expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, resulting in intracellular retention of gamma2. Structure analysis based on a three-dimensional homology model of gamma2 (Ernst, M., Brauchart, D., Boresch, S., and Sieghart, W. (2003) Neuroscience 119, 933-943) reveals that serine 171 may play a critical role in the formation and stabilization of an exposed turn structure that is part of the subunit interaction site.

Data indicate that olanzapine increases the amplitude of the N40, P80, and P20/N40 components of the auditory evoked potential, whereas haloperidol had no such effect. The ISI paradigm also allowed for an evaluation of several components of the mouse evoked potential to assess those that display response properties similar to the human P50 and N100. Data suggest that the mouse N40 displays an ISI response relationship that shares characteristics with the human N100, whereas the P20 appears more consistent with the human P50 across the ISI range evaluated in this task.

Propofol (20, 40, 60 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) significantly increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms compared to control. Caffeine (30 mg/kg) and m-CPP (2.5 mg/kg) decreased the percentage of time spent in the open arms and these effects were antagonized when propofol (40 mg/kg) was administered before the test. L-arginine (100 mg/kg) has also produced anxiogenic effect and this effect was not prevented by propofol. All drugs used in this study did not significantly change locomotor activity.

In contrast, pretreatment of animals with the less active enantiomer (R)-GR205171 (10 mg/kg, s.c.), which demonstrated negligible tachykinin NK1 receptor occupancy ex vivo, failed to affect either basal or stress-induced DOPAC concentration in medial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, pretreatment of animals with the benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor antagonist, flumazenil (15 mg/kg, i.p.), did not affect the ability of (S)-GR205171 to attenuate the increase of medial prefrontal cortex DOPAC concentration by acute stress. Results demonstrate that the selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, (S)-GR205171, attenuated the stress-induced activation of mesocortical dopamine neurones by a mechanism independent of the benzodiazepine modulatory site of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "146": "It is known that benzodiazepines have a hypotensive effect, but the mechanism has not been well elucidated yet. To clarify whether this effect is due to central or peripheral mechanism, we administered 5 mg of diazepam or saline intravenously to healthy volunteers and assessed the change in blood pressure, heart rate, muscle sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate variability. After diazepam administration, systolic and mean blood pressure decreased significantly. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was also significantly reduced but heart rate did not change, whereas the variables of spectral analysis of heart rate variability did not show significant change. We concluded that the hypotensive effect of diazepam in human is mainly due to the central mechanism.", 
    "147": "To investigate the relationship between polyamines and stress, we measured polyamine levels in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and plasma of mice after acute restraint or water-immersion restraint stress. In all parts of the brain, putrescine levels were elevated (139-157% of the control) 24 h after water-immersion restraint stress. In the case of restraint, however, elevation of the putrescine level (130% of the control) was detected only in the frontal cortex. Spermidine and spermine levels were unchanged or slightly reduced (80-85% of the control) in the brain 6 and 24 h after water-immersion restraint stress. There was no change in plasma polyamine levels at any time subsequent to the stress. Pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) completely blocked the stress-induced putrescine increases. These results indicate that the magnitude of the putrescine increase is dependent upon the intensity of the stressor, and suggest that polyamine metabolism is linked to psychological stress.",

    "149": "We conducted a prospective, controlled, open study comparing body weight, fat mass, and indices of insulin resistance/ sensitivity in 10 olanzapine-treated patients with ICD-10 schizophrenia (olanzapine dose range, 7.5-20 mg/day) with those of a group of 10 mentally and physically healthy volunteers. Weight, fat mass, and indices of insulin resistance/sensitivity were assessed over individual 8-week observation periods from November 1997 to October 1999.", 
    "150": "Fasting serum glucose and fasting serum insulin increased significantly in the olanzapine-treated patients (p =.008 for glucose and p =.006 for insulin). The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index for beta cell function did not change significantly in the olanzapine-treated patients, whereas the HOMA index for insulin resistance did increase (p =.006). In the control group, these parameters were stable. A significant increase in body weight (p =.001) and body fat (p =.004) was seen in patients treated with olanzapine, while the control group showed no significant changes.", 
    "151": "This study indicates that the disturbances in glucose homeostasis during antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine are mainly due to insulin resistance. However, beta cell function remains unaltered in olanzapine-treated patients. We conclude that treatment with some second-generation antipsychotic drugs may lead to insulin resistance.", 
    "152": "A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for recovery of the lipophilic drug, alprazolam, from matrix tablets containing the hydrophilic polymer hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) was developed. Lipophilic drugs, such as alprazolam, are difficult to completely extract and quantitate from tablets containing HPMC polymer. The percentage of recoveries of alprazolam from placebo powder spiked with alprazolam stock solution and from placebo powder mixed with alprazolam powder were about 100% and 85% to 95%, respectively. The validated method using water to completely dissolve HPMC before the addition of a strong solvent to dissolve and extract the drug from the HPMC solution was shown to be the most reproducible method. Different molecular weight distributions of the HPMC polymer, such as HPMC-K4M and HPMC-K100LV, did not influence the dissolution results of alprazolam using this validated method. Similarly, the excipients composing the matrix tablet formulations, such as dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, calcium sulfate dihydrate, sucrose, dextrose, and lactose monohydrate, did not influence the percent recovery of alprazolam. The recovery method reported herein was shown to be the most efficient to achieve complete recovery of alprazolam from powder blends and tablets containing a variety of excipients and different grades of HPMC.", 
    "153": "The positive role of benzodiazepines (Midazolam) in conscious sedation in pediatric patients is widely known. However, problems concerning the role of sedation in diagnostic upper endoscopy are a matter for debate as little is known about dosage and timing. We prospectively evaluated the efficacy, safety and optimal intravenous sedation dosage of midazolam in 257 consecutive patients, aged 2 months to 18 years old, who underwent upper endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract. The initial midazolam dosage was 0.2 mg/kg Bw (Body weight) i.v. for 1 minute and, if necessary, another 0.1 mg/kg Bw was administered 5 minutes later. If sedation was sufficient, the procedure would be started 4-5 minutes later; if not, another 0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg Bw would be administered. All procedures were performed by a pediatrician together with a gastroenterologist. No serious complications occurred in any of the procedures. Oxygen saturation (OS) was maintained at over 90%, if necessary with blowby oxygen. Flumazenil was administered to 7 children (OS < 90%). Endoscopy could not be completed in 1 child. All endoscopies were completed within 10 minutes. No unexpected hospital admissions were necessary. The mean midazolam dosage was 0.4 mg/kg Bw in patients up to 6 years, for the over 6 years-olds the mean dosage was decreased to 0,2 mg/kg Bw. Particular attention was paid to the importance of informing patients before the procedure. Endoscopic diagnostic procedures can be performed safely and effectively in children with intravenous sedation in a well equipped pediatric endoscopy unit.", 
    "154": "Previous studies have demonstrated that gastric mucosa contained high levels of the polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor, the endogenous ligand of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). However, the expression and function of this receptor protein in these tissues have not been investigated. Immunohistochemistry identified an intense PBR immunoreactivity in the mucous and parietal cells of rat gastric fundus and in the mucous cells of antrum. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the mitochondrial localization of PBR in these cells. Binding of isoquinoline PK 11195 and benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 to gastric membranes showed that fundus had more PBR-binding sites than antrum, displaying higher affinity for PK 11195 than Ro5-4864. In a Ussing chamber, PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 increased short-circuit current (I(sc)) in fundic and antral mucosa in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of GABA(A) and central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) blockers. This increase in I(sc) was abolished after external Cl(-) substitution and was sensitive to chloride channels or transporter inhibitors. PK 11195-induced chloride secretion was also 1) sensitive to verapamil and extracellular calcium depletion, 2) blocked by thapsigargin and intracellular calcium depletion, and 3) abolished by the mitochondrial pore transition complex inhibitor cyclosporine A. PK 11195 had no direct effect on H(+) secretion, indicating that it stimulates a component of Cl(-) secretion independent of acid secretion in fundic mucosa. These data demonstrate that mucous and parietal cells of the gastric mucosa express mitochondrial PBR functionally coupled to Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) secretion, possibly involved in the gastric mucosa protection.", 
    "155": "The subjective, psychomotor, and physiological effects of a widely prescribed prescription opioid, propoxyphene, have not been studied in a population of non-drug-abusing people. The drug also has potential for abuse and it was of interest in the present study to determine if the drug had any abuse liability-related subjective effects in this population.",

Measures were assessed before and for 300 min after drug administration.", 
    "157": "Both morphine and lorazepam produced subjective effects. There were no statistically significant subjective effects obtained with any dose of propoxyphene in the group as a whole, but approximately 30-50% of the subjects did appear to experience subjective effects from the drug. Drug liking was not consistently observed in this subset. Propoxyphene, unlike lorazepam, did not impair psychomotor or cognitive performance. Both propoxyphene and morphine produced miosis.", 
    "158": "There was a lack of statistically significant subjective effects of propoxyphene in the group as a whole, including a propoxyphene dose that was twice as high as the typical clinically-prescribed dose of 100 mg. However, there were some subjects who did report effects, consistent with the notion that patients differ in their sensitivity to opioid effects.", 
    "159": "Despite early recognition of the importance of internal cues (craving sensations and emotional states) for relapse in substance use disorders, relatively little attention has been devoted to exposure-based treatments targeting these cues. Drawing upon research on the conceptualization and treatment of panic disorder, we discuss the application of internal (largely emotional) cue exposure for substance use disorders. Our model for this discussion was based on the role of exposure to feared sensations of anxiety in the treatment of panic disorder and benzodiazepine (BZ) discontinuation. Shared research strategies between panic disorder and substance use--studies of biological provocation and anxiety sensitivity--were discussed, as were gender differences in drug-use motives. In accordance with research on anxiety sensitivity, provocation effects, and the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal, we discussed the potential value of internal cue-exposure strategies for individuals who use substances as a way to cope with negative affect.", 
    "160": "Cardiac output may be an important determinant of the induction dose of intravenous anaesthetic. Esmolol is known to reduce cardiac output, and we examined its effect on the propofol dose required for induction of anaesthesia. The size of the effect seen with esmolol was compared with midazolam co-induction. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to placebo (saline), esmolol (1mg x kg(-1) bolus, followed by an infusion at 250 microg x kg(-1)min(-1)) or midazolam (0.04 mg x kg(-1)) groups. Induction of anaesthesia commenced 3 min following the administration of the study drug, using a Diprifusor set to achieve plasma propofol concentrations of 10 microg x ml(-1) at 5 min. The primary end point used was the propofol dose per kg at loss of response to command. The mean (SD) propofol dose for each group was 2.38 (0.48) mg x kg(-1) for placebo, 1.79 (0.36) mg x kg(-1) for esmolol and 1.34 (0.35) mg x kg(-1) for midazolam (all means significantly different; p < 0.0005). We found that predosing with esmolol reduces the propofol requirements for induction of anaesthesia by 25%.", 
    "161": "(Midazolam is often used for premedication; it is known to promote vasodilation and may therefore affect redistribution of heat during surgery. We examined the effect of pre-operative administration of midazolam on the development of intra-operative hypothermia. Forty-five patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups to receive no premedication (Group C), IM midazolam 0.04 mg.kg(-1) (Group M1) or 0.08 mg.kg(-1) (Group M2) 30 min prior to anaesthesia. Sedation levels were assessed, and then general anaesthesia was induced and maintained using propofol and fentanyl. During surgery, core temperature, which was similar for the three groups prior to induction of anaesthesia, decreased significantly less in the midazolam groups M1 and M2 compared to the control group C. Patients who were more heavily sedated prior to induction of anaesthesia, had significantly lower core temperatures peri-operatively than those who were less sedated, and core temperatures in unpremedicated patients fell to significantly lower levels during surgery than those who were drowsy. We conclude that pre-operative administration of midazolam produces an effect on the development of peri-operative hypothermia. We found that moderate pre-operative sedation reduces the peri-operative heat loss, possibly by affecting core-to-peripheral heat distribution.", 
    "162": "New molecular platforms which are hybrids of two scaffolds-namely, beta-d-glucose and benzodiazepine, each able to bind several proteins-were designed, synthesized and functionalized to serve as probes for broad biological screening. Herein, we describe the syntheses and chemical properties of these novel chimeric scaffolds. Attempted cyclization of the functionalized analogues (-)-96 and (-)-97 afforded the corresponding dimers (-)-98 and (-)-99, respectively, under a variety of reaction conditions, even at concentrations of only 0.001 N. Consideration of factors affecting the conformation of amide bonds and their effects on cyclization reactions led us to alkylate the amide bond. As expected, the cyclization of the N-methyl derivative (-)-110 afforded exclusively the unimolecular cyclization product (+)-111. These compounds are only now undergoing broad screening and represent therefore at present a \"prospecting library.\"",

    "164": "M(3) KO versus wild-type mice aged 1 month to 2 years were included. Gastric acid secretion was assessed by both direct intragastric pH measurement and pylorus ligation. Serum gastrin and gastric mucosal histamine levels were determined by radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Morphologic analysis was performed by both immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.", 
    "165": "Fasted M(3) KO mice exhibited higher intragastric pH, lower acid output after pylorus ligation, a lower proportion of active parietal cells, and higher serum gastrin levels than fasted wild-type mice. Acid secretion in response to carbachol, histamine, gastrin 17, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose was impaired in the mutant mice. Although carbachol was still able to cause approximately 30% acid output in M(3) KO mice, the acid secretion was inhibited by pirenzepine or famotidine. Despite remarkable hypergastrinemia in M(3) KO mice, there were no trophic responses in the oxyntic mucosa with respect to the mucosal thickness, proliferation rate, and numbers of parietal and enterochromaffin-like cells. Cholecystokinin type 2 receptor antagonist YM022 was without the effect in M(3) KO mice.", 
    "166": "The present study shows that M(3) receptors are essential for basal acid secretion, a fully acid secretory response to histamine and gastrin, and the trophic responses of oxyntic mucosa to gastrin.", 
    "167": "Auditory responsiveness in nucleus HVC, a high-order sensorimotor area of the avian song system, is modulated by changes in behavioral state. Modulation is not observed in the primary thalamo-recipient auditory area Field L, the indirect source of auditory input to HVC. In this study, we show that auditory responsiveness in nucleus interfacialis (NIf), the immediate auditory afferent to HVC, is modulated by behavioral state. While auditory responsiveness is generally greater in NIf during wakefulness and in HVC during sedation, simultaneous recordings reveal a co-variation of auditory response magnitude. This co-variation is observed both in awake birds, where responses are spontaneously variable, and in sedated birds during manipulations of arousal levels. Auditory responses in NIf and HVC, which are selective for the bird's own song (BOS) during sedation, become predominantly unselective during wakefulness. This loss of selectivity is accompanied by a decrease in the similarity of NIf and HVC response patterns. To explore the role of NIf in shaping HVC auditory responses, we pharmacologically manipulated NIf while recording in HVC. Injection of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol into NIf eliminated most spontaneous activity and all auditory responses in the ipsilateral HVC, while injections of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline increased HVC auditory responsiveness and selectivity. These findings indicate that HVC is not the initial site of behavioral state-dependent modulation in the song system. Together with the suppression of HVC auditory responses by muscimol in NIf, these results suggest that NIf plays an important role in the flow of auditory information to HVC.", 
    "168": "In an attempt to examine whether the muscarinic receptor-activated intestinal function is altered by aging, we studied the changes in (1) contractile responses to acetylcholine (Ach), (2) muscarinic cholinoceptors and (3) cholinesterase (ChE) activities, in jejunum and colon of the young (2-3 months) and aged (24-28 months) Fischer 344 rats. In the physiological contraction experiments of jejunum and colon, Ach concentration-dependently increased the force of contraction, and the contractile responses to Ach were not affected by aging. In addition, the true- and pseudo-ChE activities were not significantly changed by aging. The Ach-induced contraction was competitively inhibited by muscarinic M3-selective antagonist hexahydro-sila-difenidolhydrochloride p-fluoroanalog (p-F-HHSiD), suggesting that the contractile responses in the rat jejunum and colon were mediated through M3-cholinoceptor. Age-related changes in muscarinic cholinoceptors of jejunum and colon were determined with the use of specific muscarinic radioligand [3H]-quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB). The [3H]QNB saturation binding experiments revealed that the maximal binding (B(max)) was increased only in aged jejunum without changes in K(D) values. These results suggest that aging may not attenuate the Ach-induced intestinal contraction via muscarinic M3 receptor, although the expression of muscarinic cholinoceptor is differentially modulated in jejunum and colon.", 
    "169": "The anticonvulsant activity of competitive 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo (F)-quinoxaline (NBQX) and noncompetitive 2,3-benzodiazepines and tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists, was tested in different experimental seizure models and compared with diazepam, a conventional antiepileptic drug acting on GABAergic neurotransmission. In particular, the compounds were evaluated against audiogenic and maximal electroshock seizures (MES) test and pentetrazol (PTZ) seizures model, and all of them showed protective action. In addition, NBQX, 2,3-benzodiazepines and THIQs, but not diazepam, were also protective against clonic and tonic seizures and lethality induced by kainate, AMPA and ATPA, but were ineffective against NMDA-induced seizures. Only 2,3-benzodiazepines and some THIQs were able to affect 4-aminopyridine- and mercaptopropionic-acid-induced seizures. The duration of anticonvulsant action of 33 micromol/kg of some 2,3-benzodiazepines and THIQs was also investigated in DBA/2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to audiogenic seizures, and it was observed that the derivative THIQ-10c, possessing an acetyl group at the N-2 and a chlorine atom on the C-1 phenyl ring, showed higher anticonvulsant activity and longer-lasting protective effects.", 
    "170": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of midazolam on the retrieval and acquisition rate of two-way active avoidance in rats. In the schedule 2 x 100 trials, the effects of midazolam (0.5-5.0 mg/kg), benzodiazepine binding site antagonist flumazenil (2.5-10.0 mg/kg), specific antagonist of GABA(A) receptor, bicuculline (0.5-4.0 mg/kg), and the blocker of GABA(A) receptor containing Cl(-) channels, picrotoxin (1.0-5.0 mg/kg), on the second day retrieval of avoidance performance were investigated, as well as the influence of the used blockers of GABA(A) receptor function on midazolam effects. Furthermore, the effect of midazolam (1.0 mg/kg) on acquisition rate in the 5 x 50 schedule, as well as the effects of third day treatment changing in that paradigm, was examined. Throughout the study, drugs were given intraperitoneally, 30 min before testing. Midazolam at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg facilitated avoidance retrieval, whereas flumazenil and bicuculline did not significantly change behavior. Picrotoxin (5.0 mg/kg) diminished performance. All three kinds of blockers used abolished facilitatory action of midazolam, confirming GABAergic mediation of the effect of benzodiazepine. Midazolam (1.0 mg/kg) increased acquisition rate during five consecutive days relative to saline, but without significant effect on the first day acquisition. In the case of third day changing of treatments, the intersection of regression rate lines was detected. Results from active avoidance paradigm experimentally support the findings from human studies that in certain circumstances, benzodiazepines, potentiating GABAergic neurotransmission, could produce retrieval-enhancing effects in memory tasks.", 
    "171": "Since the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been primarily found as a high-affinity binding site for diazepam in rat kidney, numerous studies of it have been performed. However, the physiological role and functions of PBR have not been fully elucidated. Currently, we presented the pharmacological profile of two high and selective PBR ligands, N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(4-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (7-096, DAA1106) (PBR: IC(50)=0.28 nM) and N-(4-chloro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-isopropoxybenzyl)acetamide (7-099, DAA1097) (PBR: IC(50)=0.92 nM). The compounds are aryloxyanilide derivatives, and identified with known PBR ligands such as benzodiazepine (1, Ro5-4864), isoquinoline (2, PK11195), imidazopyridine (3, Alpidem), and indole (5, FGIN-1-27) derivatives. The aryloxyanilide derivatives, which have been derived by opening the diazepine ring of 1, are a novel class as PBR ligands and have exhibited high and selective affinity for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs). These novel derivatives would be useful for exploring the functions of PBR. In this paper, the design, synthesis and structure-affinity relationships of aryloxyanilide derivatives are described.", 
    "172": "Sildenafil (Viagra) has been introduced recently in market to correct male impotency and has gained immense popularity for its dramatic effects all over the world. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of sildenafil on learning and memory in mice using elevated plus maze. A total of XV groups of animals were employed in the present study. Central cholinergic pathways play a crucial role in learning and memory processes. Physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg kg(-1), i.p) was employed for its memory enhancing property and alprazolam a benzodiazepine receptor agonist served as a memory-impairing agent. In the present study, alprazolam produced anterograde amnesia (at 0.5 mg kg(-1), i.p) and retrograde amnesia (at 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg kg(-1), i.p.) in separate groups of animals. Caffeine at 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg kg(-1), i.p. (an established psychostimulant) did not show any significant change in learning and memory of mice. Sildenafil (at 8 mg kg(-1), i.p.) administered 30 minutes prior to training on first day produced a marginal decrease in transfer latency time on first day; whereas, sildenafil (at 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg kg(-1), i.p.) administered immediately after training on first day produced a dose-dependent improvement of memory in mice. However, further studies need to be carried out to elucidate the underlying mechanism of sildenafil as a memory enhancer.", 
    "173": "The present study investigates the effect of progesterone, a pregnane precursor of neurosteroids, and 4'-chlordiazepam (4'-CD), a specific ligand for mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor receptor (MDR) involved in neurosteroidogenesis, on restraint stress (RS)-induced modulation of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. RS produced a significant reduction in anti-sheep red blood cells (SRBC) antibody titre, a measure of humoral immune response, and % leucocyte migration inhibition (LMI) and foot-pad thickness test, measures of cell-mediated immune responses. These effects of RS on immune responses were effectively blocked by pretreating the animals with progesterone (10 mg/kg, sc) or 4'-CD (0.5 mg/kg, sc) administered just before subjecting the animal to RS. The effect of both progesterone and 4'-CD on RS-induced immune modulation was significantly attenuated by bicuculline (2 mg/kg, ip) but not by flumazenil (10 mg/kg, ip). Unlike its effect on RS-induced immune responsiveness, progesterone (5, 10 mg/kg, sc) when administered to non-stressed animals produced a significant suppression of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses which was not reversed by bicuculline. However, 4'-CD failed to modulate immune response in naive non-stressed animals. These results suggest that progesterone and 4'-CD affect stress-induced immune responses by modulating GABA-ergic mechanism. However, GABA-A receptor system does not appear to be involved in progesterone-induced immunosuppression in nonstressed animals.",

Adherence to index medication varied between the groups (O = 60%; R = 54%; H = 37%; P < =.01 for each pairwise comparison). Average postperiod costs were US dollars 14512 per subject. After baseline adjustment, there were no significant differences in mean total cost. Excluding index medication costs, the olanzapine group's average cost was significantly lower than risperidone (-US dollars 1791, P =.002) and haloperidol (-US dollars 2080, P =.003), whereas the risperidone and haloperidol groups were not significantly different. The differences were driven by significantly lower cost for inpatient services for other medications among the olanzapine group.",

Relative to risperidone or haloperidol, olanzapine may have a higher acquisition cost, but may decrease inpatient costs and be associated with more optimal medication use patterns. Use of risperidone may also increase pharmacy costs and be associated with greater persistence, relative to haloperidol.", 
    "184": "Status asthmaticus is a life-threatening episode of asthma that is refractory to usual therapy. Recent studies report an increase in the severity and mortality associated with asthma. In the airways, inflammatory cell infiltration and activation and cytokine generation produce airway injury and edema, bronchoconstriction and mucus plugging. The key pathophysiological consequence of severe airflow obstruction is dynamic hyperinflation. The resulting hypoxemia, tachypnea together with increased metabolic demands on the muscles of respiration may lead to respiratory muscle failure. The management of status asthmaticus involves intensive pharmacological therapy particularly with beta-adrenoceptor agonists (beta-agonists) and corticosteroids. Albuterol (salbutamol) is the most commonly used beta2-selective inhaled bronchodilator in the US. Epinephrine (adrenaline) or terbutaline, administered subcutaneously, have not been shown to provide greater bronchodilatation compared with inhaled beta-agonists. Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone should be administered early. Aerosolized corticosteroids are not recommended for patients with status asthmaticus. Inhaled anticholinergic agents may be useful in patients refractory to inhaled beta-agonists and corticosteroids. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the strategy aims to avoid dynamic hyperinflation by enhancing expiratory time to allow complete exhalation. Complications of dynamic inflation are hypotension and barotrauma. Sedation with opioids, benzodiazepines or propofol is required to facilitate ventilator synchrony but neuromuscular blockade should be avoided as myopathy has been a reported complication. Overall, in the management of patients with status asthmaticus, the challenge to the pulmonary/critical care clinician is to provide optimal pharmacological and ventilatory support and avoid the adverse consequences of dynamic hyperinflation.",

Patients were monitored and evaluated for a mean duration of 17.7 (range 12-26) months while on olanzapine therapy. Very few side effects were observed during treatment. All patients showed clinically significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale, as well as an improved score as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Our observations support the use of long-term olanzapine therapy for symptom control in patients with pervasive developmental disorders.", 
    "186": "Using CYP3A4-expressing Caco-2 cell monolayers, we assessed the roles of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux, and serum protein binding in determining the extent of the intestinal first-pass extraction (E(i)) of saquinavir. Saquinavir (5-40 microM) was added to the apical compartment of culture inserts. After 3 h, apical and basolateral media and cell scrapings were analyzed for saquinavir and a major CYP3A4-mediated metabolite (M7). The intracellular concentration of saquinavir was estimated from the degree of inhibition of CYP3A4 catalytic activity (midazolam 1'-hydroxylation). Compared with vehicle, the P-gp inhibitor LY335979 (zosuquidar trihydrochloride) (0.5 microM, apical) increased saquinavir cell content and M7 formation rate, but decreased the E(i) by approximately 50% due to a >90% increase in the amount of saquinavir recovered in the basolateral compartment. Compared with LY335779, physiological concentrations of basolateral serum proteins [human serum albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG)] increased saquinavir permeability by a similar degree but decreased the E(i) by approximately 50% due to a marked reduction in M7 formation. Increasing AAG concentration (1.0-2.5 g/l) had no additional effect on permeability or E(i). An estimate of the range of the E(i) of saquinavir (7-60%) was less than has been predicted based on in vitro data (>99%) but was consistent with a clinical study involving grapefruit juice. The incidental finding of greater M7 formation after basolateral compared with apical dosing could not be explained by differences in saquinavir cell content. We conclude that variable intestinal first-pass extraction of saquinavir in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients could reflect variation in P-gp-mediated efflux and/or CYP3A4-catalyzed metabolism, but not in blood AAG levels."
