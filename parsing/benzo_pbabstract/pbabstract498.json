The used analytical methods of studied potential impurities, both from the synthesis and from degradation under exceptional conditions, are summarized and their validation is done. At last the Pinazepam satisfactory big stability is shown.", 
    "1": "The Authors, after a brief review of malignant hyperthermia (MH), describe the use of NLA a Harrington's surgical procedure in a malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) patient. Such an anaesthesiological procedure, using benzodiazepines, droperidol, fentanyl, pancuronium and N2O/O2, didn't lead to any form of MH crisis on to complications.", 
    "2": "The acute effects of diazepam (Valium) were assessed using a battery of complex food-reinforced operant tasks that included responding in delayed matching to sample (DMTS, n = 5), conditioned position response (CPR, n = 7) progressive ratio (PR, n = 8), temporal response differentiation (TRD, n = 4), and incremental repeated acquisition (IRA, n = 9) tests. Diazepam (0.25-4.0 mg/kg IV) produced significant dose-dependent decreases in the number of reinforcers obtained in the TRD and IRA tasks only. TRD accuracy was significantly decreased at doses of 0.25, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg when compared to vehicle injections. Significant decreases in IRA accuracy generally did not occur at doses below 1.0 mg/kg. DMTS accuracy was decreased at 0.5 mg/kg for some time delays but showed no clear dose-delay interaction. Performance in the CPR and PR tests showed no significant effects of diazepam exposure over the dose range tested. These results indicate that diazepam selectively disrupts performance of operant tasks in monkeys designed to model human correlates of time perception, learning ability and visual attention/short-term memory while not affecting tasks designed to model motivation and position/color discrimination.", 
    "3": "Rats implanted with electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus were trained in a discrete trial procedure to make a differential response (right or left lever press) in the presence or absence of brain stimulation. When a high level of accuracy (95% correct) was attained in the discrimination, testing with vehicle, RO 15-4513, diazepam (1.0-10 mg/kg), diazepam plus RO 15-4513 (1.0 mg/kg), pentobarbital (1.0-17.5 mg/kg) and pentobarbital plus RO 15-4513 began. Diazepam, at 10 mg/kg, disrupted the discrimination behavior, and it also decreased the total number of lever-presses and increased the time to complete the session. These effects were blocked by the coadministration of 1.0 mg/kg RO 15-4513. Pentobarbital produced effects similar to those of diazepam, but these effects were only reversed to a limited extent by RO 15-4513. By itself, however, RO 15-4513 also decreased the total number of lever presses and increased the time to complete the session. Results were consistent with our previous findings with alcohol and RO 15-4513, and supported the notion that diazepam and alcohol have some similar effects at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "4": "Administration of 3 fmol of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) into the postero-median nucleus accumbens (NAS) induced an hypoexploration measured using the four-hole box and an increase in the emotional states of rats observed in the elevated plus maze. These effects seem likely to involve CCKA receptors since they were reversed by the selective CCKA antagonist L364,718 (100 micrograms/kg, 200 micrograms/kg IP) and not observed after injection of 0.1 to 1000 fmol unsulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8NS) in the same region. On the other hand, CCK8 or CCK8NS injected into the anterior NAS did not significantly modify these behaviors. These results support the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in the distribution of CCK and its binding sites in the NAS, but raise the question of the presence of CCKA receptors not detected in binding studies and of the behavioral effects mediated by CCKB receptor stimulation in this structure.", 
    "5": "Rats were injected (IP) with diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (10.0 mg/kg) with a 30-min interval between the two injections. After 10-12 repeated drug pairings of this type, the thermic, muscle relaxant, and anxiolytic responses of the animals to diazepam alone were tested. These tests revealed: 1) an enhanced hypothermia (rectal temperature), 2) an attenuated muscle relaxant effect (inclined plane test), and 3) a potentiated anxiolytic effect (plus-maze test). Although various interdrug associations have previously been demonstrated using other measures of conditioning, this is the first instance in which changes in the therapeutic effects of a drug (in this case, muscle relaxation and anxiety reduction) have been obtained with this procedure.", 
    "6": "The muscle relaxant activities of orphenadrine (Norflex) and diazepam (Valium) were compared in several animal models. In mice, tonic extensor seizures evoked by electroshock or pentylenetetrazol were inhibited by both agents. The protective index (ataxic dose divided by protective dose) was greater than 1 for orphenadrine, whereas for diazepam it was greater than 1 only in the case of the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. In strychnine-treated mice, diazepam protected against deaths following tonic extensor seizures, but orphenadrine did not. The protective index for diazepam, however, was less than 1. In cats, orphenadrine and diazepam both were capable of blocking decerebrate ridigity, but not in all animals. The protective index for orphenadrine in animals in which it was active, was greater than 1, while that for diazepam, when it was active, was less than 1. Orphenadrine and diazepam were tested in rabbits in the sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation. Neither drug directly affected nerve muscle stimulation. It would appear that both agents are acting via the central nervous system when they suppress hypertonic skeletal muscle activity, but only orphenadrine exhibits protective indices consistently greater than 1.", 
    "7": "The authors studied the availability of parenteral solutions of diazepam in glass bottles or polyethylene (PE) containers during infusion through polyvinyl chloride (PVC) administration sets. Diazepam solutions in concentration of 1000 mg/500 ml in 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) and 5% glucose (G5W) injection were infused at a flow rate of 30 ml/h, and samples were taken from the bottle and at the end of the administration set, till 12 hours of infusion. The samples were tested in triplicate using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The greatest loss of diazepam was observed in all solutions at 30 minutes of infusion (63.5% G5W glass, 60.5% NS glass, 55% G5W PE and 58% NS PE from the original concentration of 200 micrograms/ml). The diazepam concentrations in the containers did not significantly changed. The loss of diazepam from solutions infused through PVC administration sets should be kept in mind in severe clinical situations as status epilepticus, tetanus and eclampsia.", 
    "8": "Products originated from Chlordiazepoxide (I) hydrochloride/sodium nitrite interaction were analyzed by HPLC. The studied reactions were carried out in diluted hydrochloric acid solutions at pH values ranging between 0.5-5.0. Depending on the reaction pH values and molar ratios it was possible to find and assess variable amounts of the N-nitrosochlordiazepoxide (II), the dihydroquinazoline (III) and the lactam (IV). The highest degree of N-nitrosation was found at pH 3.5. At this pH value the yields of (II) were respectively 54.8% and 18.3% when the drug (I)/nitrite molar ratios were correspondingly 0.41 and 0.25. When the reaction was performed in concentrations which is possible to find in the gastric juice of patients taking (I) together with nitrite-rich foods the yield of (II) at pH 3.5 was 2.5%. Since in the meantime the genotoxicity of (II) was proved, \"in vivo\" formation of N-nitrosochlordiazepoxide (II) represents a potential risk not to be underestimated.", 
    "9": "Effects of CCK-8 receptor agonists caerulein and pentagastrin and CCK-8 receptor antagonist proglumide on exploratory and locomotor activity of mice and rats were studied. Systemic administration of caerulein (500 ng/kg 1 mcg/kg) decreased significantly the exploratory activity of mice in elevated plus-maze. This anxiogenic-like action of caerulein was attenuated by acute pretreatment with proglumide (1 and 15 mg/kg) but not with diazepam (up to 0.75 mg/kg). Proglumide slightly increased the exploratory activity of rats in plus-maze; on the other hand, caerulein and pentagastrin potently decreased the measures of exploration in this test. Caerulein (10-100 mcg/kg) and proglumide (1 and 15 mg/kg) inhibited 3H-pentagastrin binding in mice brain in in vivo experiments. The data obtained indicate that CCK-8-ergic mechanisms in brain play an important role in the generation of anxiety states in rodents.", 
    "10": "The use of caffeine or diazepam in experiments on dogs recovered after a 12-min circulatory arrest has no significant effect on the end points of resuscitation, as compared to the control. Diazepam has a more favourable effect on the recovery of central nervous system functions than caffeine. Combined use of caffeine and diazepam or lidocaine at certain stages of the early postresuscitation period accelerates the recovery of the neurological status and improves the outcome of resuscitation.", 
    "11": "Inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances, primarily opiates and benzodiazepines, is the most common complaint brought before the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners. We describe the malpractice claims experience of 120 physicians previously investigated by the Oregon board for inappropriate prescribing. These physicians were matched with a comparison group by age, specialty, and practice location. We found that a mean of one malpractice claim had been filed against each physician in our study, with the specialties of obstetrics and gynecology, neurosurgery, and orthopedics having the most claims. A significantly higher mean number of malpractice claims had been filed against 31 physicians disciplined by the board. Our study suggests a role for state regulatory boards in the malpractice area. We propose that such bodies do practice reviews based on the convergence of two events, a disciplinary action such as those described in this article and the filing of more than one malpractice claim against a physician. Further research is needed on inappropriate prescribing by physicians and its possible association with malpractice.", 
    "12": "Pulp electric excitability thresholds in different teeth groups and their changes under effects of analgin, amidopyrin and diasepam were studied using electro-odontometry in 58 patients and in experimental recordings of neuronal activity in rostral part of trigeminal complex under electrostimulation of molar and fang teeth. Baseline thresholds of pulp stimulation proved different in anterior teeth group and premolar/molar group. Analgetic drugs used had more pronounced effect in cases of molar pulp stimulation.", 
    "13": "The effects of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), baclofen, and clonidine was studied on footshock-induced aggression in mice. A lower dose (200 mg/kg) of GABA enhanced the aggressive score, while at a higher dose (400 mg/kg) it attenuated the aggressive behavior, the latter effect being reversed both by bicuculline and picrotoxin (PTX). Clonidine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) enhanced the aggressive score, and the effect of clonidine was reversed by idazoxan. GABA (400 mg/kg) and clonidine (1 mg/kg) significantly reduced the aggressive score in reserpinized mice. Baclofen (5 mg/kg) showed no effect per se in either reserpinized or non-reserpinized mice. On concomitant administration of clonidine (0.5 mg/kg) with a subeffective dose of either GABA, baclofen, or diazepam, there was significant reduction in the aggressive score. A modulatory role of GABAergic and noradrenergic systems in footshock-induced aggression is suggested.", 
    "14": "In an attempt to assess the structural requirements of hexahydro-sila-difenidol for potency and selectivity, a series of analogues modified in the amino group and the phenyl ring were investigated for their affinity to muscarinic M1-(rabbit vas deferens), M2- (guinea-pig atria) and M3- (guinea-pig ileum) receptors. All compounds were competitive antagonists in the three tissues. Their affinities to the three muscarinic receptor subtypes differed by more than two orders of magnitude and the observed receptor selectivities were not associated with high affinity. The pyrrolidino and hexamethyleneimino analogues, compounds substituted in the phenyl ring with a methoxy group or a chlorine atom as well as p-fluoro-hexahydro-difenidol displayed the same affinity profile as the parent compound, hexahydro-sila-difenidol: M1 approximately M3 greater than M2. A different selectivity pattern was observed for p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol: M3 greater than M1 greater than M2. This compound exhibited its highest affinity for M3-receptors in guinea-pig ileum (pA2 = 7.84), intermediate affinity for M1-receptors in rabbit vas deferens (pA2 = 6.68) and lowest affinity for the M2-receptors in guinea-pig atria (pA2 = 6.01). This receptor selectivity profile of p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol was confirmed in ganglia (M1), atria (M2) and ileum (M3) of the rat. Furthermore, dose ratios obtained with either pirenzepine (M1) or hexahydrosila-difenidol (M2 and M3) and the p-fluoro analogue used in combination suggested that the antagonism was additive, implying mutual competition with a single population of muscarinic receptor subtypes. These results indicate that p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol represents a valuable tool for characterization of muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "15": "The response of a recently described light/dark choice novelty situation to anxiolytic and non-anxiolytic agents as well as to putative anxiogenic drugs was assessed in rats. Diazepam (1.0-10.0 mg/kg, i.p.), chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, i.p.), and pentobarbital (pentobarbitone) (7.5-15.0 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced rats' activity in the dark and brightly lit compartments as well as crossings between the two, while imipramine (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effects. None of these drugs changed animal locomotion in activity cages. d-Amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a significant increase in the three parameters used to measure rats' exploratory activity, but the effect was due to an increase in the general activity of the animal. No tolerance to the effects of diazepam developed after daily treatment with 5 mg/kg i.p. for 15 days. Non-sedative and non-convulsant doses of putative anxiogenic drugs such as yohimbine (2.5-5.0 mg/kg, i.p.), picrotoxin (2.0-4.0 mg/ml, i.p.) and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (2.5-5 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the exploratory activity of rats in the dark compartment. The advantages and problems of using this test to identify anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs are discussed.", 
    "16": "Among in vivo tests to assess liver drug metabolizing enzyme induction, urinary 6-beta-hydroxycortisol (6-beta-OHF), plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and urinary D-glucaric acid are most frequently proposed. 6-beta-OHF is the most abundant unconjugated metabolite of cortisol in human urine. We measured its elimination during a clinical trial in 16 human healthy volunteers (men and women), these persons being treated by a new isoquinoleine derivative, 52028 RP (PK-11195). This drug is an antagonist of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites. Urinary excretion of 6-beta-OHF increased significantly (3.5 fold, p less than 0.01) on the 5th day of treatment (400 mg/day, orally) and remained increased as long as the treatment was continued (15 days). Control values were again observed 5 days after stopping the treatment. Plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase activity and D-glucaric acid urinary elimination are increased more than 2 fold. The data demonstrated that 6-beta-OHF in the most sensitive among the three tests performed to detect a drug metabolism induction, during this clinical trial.", 
    "17": "Chlordizaepoxide, pentylenetrazole, phenobarbital, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142), buspirone and the novel serotonin3 receptor (5-HT3) antagonist, 3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate (ICS 205-930), were examined in the two-compartment exploratory model (Crawley and Goodwin, 1980). The results indicated that, utilizing the time mice spend in the dark side of the apparatus as an index of anxiety, increased the sensitivity of the model and enabled both anxiolytic and anxiogenic agents to be detected.", 
    "18": "We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis, 7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam, a thienodiazepine derivative. Clotiazepam withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery. The administration of several benzodiazepines, chemically related to clotiazepam, did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepatitis. This observation shows that clotiazepam can induce acute hepatitis and suggests that there is no cross hepatotoxicity between clotiazepam and several benzodiazepines.", 
    "19": "A total of 45 patients with generalized anxiety disorder were treated twice daily for 2 weeks, on a double-blind basis, with 0.5 mg etizolam, 0.5 mg alprazolam or 3 mg bromazepam, and symptoms were assessed using Hamilton's rating scale for anxiety and Hamilton's rating scale for depression. Patients then received the same drug for a further 2 weeks, the drugs being given three times daily if a poor response was observed during the first 2 weeks. All drugs displayed equivalent anxiolytic activity after 2 weeks, but etizolam displayed a progressive increase in anxiolytic activity over 4 weeks of treatment. Etizolam also possessed a more marked antidepressant effect than did alprazolam or bromazepam. There were no differences in the tolerability of the three drugs.", 
    "20": "A new anesthetic method (fentanyl-midazolam-flumazenil) was compared with a previously administered anesthetic regimen (pethidine-diazepam-ketamine) in two groups of 25 women, each of whom underwent termination of pregnancy. No significant difference was found between the two groups in quality of anesthesia. Recovery was assessed by means of the Aldrete score and a visual analog scale. The recovery time was significantly shorter in patients who received the fentanyl-midazolam-flumazenil.", 
    "21": "A new anesthetic regimen (fentanyl-midazolam-flumazenil--midazolam group) was compared with a previously administered anesthetic regimen (pethidine-diazepam-ketamine--ketamine group) in 2 groups of 25 women, each of whom underwent termination of pregnancy. Patients were randomly assigned. The recovery time was significantly shorter in those patients in the midazolam group. Dosage requirements for anesthetic agents are shown. Recovery was assessed by means of the Aldrete score and a 10 cm. visual analog scale. 92% of the midazolam group and 64% of the ketamine group were willing to have the same type of recovery for a future operation. No serious complications were reported. The differences of subjective sedation values at 90 minutes and 180 minutes are not significant. In the ketamine group, 36% of the patients complained of unpleasant dreams. The recovery of the midazolam group was more comfortable.", 
    "22": "Benzodiazepine (BD) misuse and dependence in 80 patients, 1974-1983 undergoing withdrawal treatment, were investigated by means of case histories and catamnestic inquiries.", 
    "23": "Three fourth of the patients were women. Many of the patients suffered from disturbed matrimonial relations, and 36 lived unmarried, divorced, or widowed. Besides, among the men frequently vocational difficulties were found, which increased in the course of BD-taking. In particular after removal of Lorazepam or Bromazepam in 58 cases withdrawal symptoms appeared, among them seven times delirium and six times epileptic seizures (grand mal). Catamnestic inquiries were practicable in 51 patients. 20 of them had required no further treatment, while 18 took again BD. But only 3 still proved to be as well psychical as physical dependent, in contrast to 14 before withdrawal treatment. Among the 15 only psychical dependent patients 8 merely showed a low dose dependence. Hence BD-dependence proves to be remediable, and subsequently shows only little tendency to relapse.", 
    "24": "Prescription information leaflets (PILs) for penicillins, diuretics and benzodiazepines were evaluated in a small Hampshire town. A second town, in which no leaflets were distributed, acted as a control. Knowledge about these medicines was greater amongst the 252 patients who received leaflets compared with 247 controls. Significantly more patients who received leaflets knew the potential side-effects of their treatment and, with the exception of those taking penicillins, were more satisfied with the information they received. These findings add further support for the routine use of PILs in general practice.", 
    "25": "Two cDNAs encoding novel GABAA receptor subunits were isolated from a rat brain library. These subunits, gamma 2 and delta, share approximately 35% sequence identity with alpha and beta subunits and form functional GABA-gated chloride channels when expressed alone in vitro. The gamma 2 subunit is the rat homolog of the human gamma 2 subunit recently shown to be important for benzodiazepine pharmacology. Cellular localization of the mRNAs encoding the gamma 2 and delta subunits in rat brain revealed that largely distinct neuronal subpopulations express the two subunits. The delta subunit distribution resembles that of the high affinity GABAA receptor labeled with [3H]muscimol; the gamma 2 subunit distribution resembles that of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam. These findings have implications for the composition of two different GABAA receptor subtypes and for information processing in networks using GABA for signaling.", 
    "26": "The effects of systemic injections of beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCtB) were investigated with regard to normally occurring sleep and several measures of benzodiazepine receptor occupancy in rats. A dose of 30 mg/kg of beta-CCtB was found to have a long time-course of action as measured by an in vivo assay for benzodiazepine binding, with an 84% depletion of [3H]diazepam binding at one hour after the intraperitoneal injection. This dose of beta-CCtB was shown to delay sleep onset, decrease non-REM and total sleep in the first two hours after the injection, and to delay the appearance of REM sleep after the sleep onset. The dose- and time-dependence of the effects on sleep approximated the dose- and time-dependence of inhibitory effects of an IP injection of beta-CCtB on in vitro measures of benzodiazepine receptor affinity and number.", 
    "27": "Pharmacological agents are widely used to probe the mechanism of action of TRH. A number of these drugs behave as local anesthetics at high concentrations. The effect of local anesthetics on the binding of [3H]Me-TRH to specific receptors was studied using the GH4C1 line of rat pituitary tumor cells. [3H]Me-TRH binding was inhibited by classical local anesthetics with the order of potency (IC50 values): dibucaine (0.37 mM) greater than tetracaine (1.2 mM) greater than lidocaine (3.3 mM) greater than procaine and benzocaine (greater than 10 mM). IC50 values for other drugs with local anesthetic properties that inhibited [3H]Me-TRH were: 100 microM trifluoperazine, 100 microM imipramine, 170 microM chlorpromazine, 300 microM verapamil, and 700 microM propranolol. Inhibition by tetracaine and verapamil increased as the pH was raised from 6 to 8.5, indicating that the free base form of the amine drugs was the inhibitory species, and the local anesthetic effect was greater at 37 C than at 24 C or 0 C. [3H]Me-TRH binding to receptors in isolated membranes was inhibited to the same extent as binding to receptors on intact cells. Local anesthetics were 3- to 20-fold less potent at inhibiting [3H]Me-TRH to digitonin-solubilized receptors than binding to intact cells. In contrast, the potency of chlordiazepoxide, a putative TRH antagonist, to inhibit [3H]Me-TRH binding was equal using cells and solubilized receptors (IC50 = 10 microM). Local anesthetics inhibited TRH-stimulated PRL release and also inhibited basal PRL secretion and secretion stimulated by two nonhormonal secretagogues, (Bu)2cAMP and a phorbol ester.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Behavioral abnormalities have been reported in young and adult animals exposed to benzodiazepines prenatally. The presence of neurochemical alterations in the GABAergic system after prenatal benzodiazepine exposure was assessed in a chick model which avoids prenatal and postnatal maternal effects. The GABAA receptor complex, the presumed site of benzodiazepine action, was altered in adult chickens previously exposed to lorazepam for 10 days in ovo. Binding was decreased at the putative chloride channel site labeled by [35S]TBPS, coupling was decreased between this site and the GABA binding site, and function of the GABAA receptor in chloride uptake was diminished in animals exposed to prenatal lorazepam. Persistent neurochemical alterations in the GABAergic system accompany prenatal benzodiazepine exposure, and may influence subsequent behavior and development.", 
    "29": "The effects of taurine and some lipophilic derivatives of taurine on binding to GABA and benzodiazepine receptors were studied in intact cerebellar granule cells. The phenylsuccinylimido derivatives of taurine appeared to increase the binding of muscimol in micromolar concentrations, while taurine decreased it slightly. Only minor changes were seen in the basal binding of flunitrazepam, whereas stimulation of the binding by GABA was strongly reduced by piperidino, benzamido and phenyl-succinylimidotaurine with taurine itself again showing only a weak effect. Diphenylhydantoin, which bears structural resemblance to the phenylsuccinylimido group, had a strong effect on the stimulated binding of flunitrazepam and it also slightly reduced the basal level of binding. Thus, it seems possible that the effects of the phenylsuccinylimido derivatives of taurine on the binding of flunitrazepam were due to this chemical structure and not to the taurine-like core of the molecules. The phthalimido derivative of taurine, taltrimide, which has been tested in clinical trials with epileptic patients, did not show any activity in the binding studies.", 
    "30": "It has previously been shown that diazepam impairs behavioural recovery from partial unilateral ablation of the cerebral cortex in rats. The present study confirmed this in rats with large unilateral lesions of the frontal cortex and showed that diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p. daily for 14 days immediately after surgery) prevented recovery from sensory asymmetry even after 120 days. In saline-treated rats greater than 80% recovery had occurred by this time. A study of binding to benzodiazepine receptors, using an in vitro autoradiographic technique, was performed to determine whether the lack of recovery after administration of diazepam was associated with any long-term receptor changes on the damaged side of the brain. Binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 was increased by up to 40% in the caudate putamen on the decorticated side at 14-120 days. This was not significantly altered by treatment with diazepam. Binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 in the nucleus accumbens was not altered by lesion of the frontal cortex alone or after treatment with diazepam. It is concluded that the lack of recovery from sensory asymmetry, produced by diazepam after lesion of the frontal cortex cannot be correlated with any change in binding to benzodiazepine receptors within the corpus striatum.", 
    "31": "1. The interactions of chlormethiazole with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and release, and with ligand binding to sites associated with the GABAA-receptor complex and the GABAB-receptor have been studied in the rat. The GABAA-receptor was studied using [3H]-muscimol, [3H]-flunitrazepam was used to label the benzodiazepine modulatory site, and [35S]-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]-TBPS) to label the chloride channel. 2. Chlormethiazole had no effect on GABA synthesis in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum or on GABA release from cortical slices in vitro. Chlormethiazole did not displace [3H]-baclofen binding to the GABAB-receptor. 3. Chlormethiazole (IC50 = 140 microM) and pentobarbitone (IC50 = 95 microM) both inhibited [35S]-TBPS binding by increasing the rate of [35S]-TBPS dissociation. In addition, chlormethiazole caused an apparent decrease in the affinity of [35S]-TBPS binding. 4. Chlormethiazole enhanced the binding of [3H]-muscimol but had no effect on [3H]-flunitrazepam binding. In contrast, the sedative barbiturate pentobarbitone enhanced both [3H]-muscimol and [3H]-flunitrazepam binding. 5. It is concluded that the sedative and anticonvulsant effects of chlormethiazole are probably mediated through an action at the GABAA-receptor. However, chlormethiazole does not interact with the GABAA-receptor complex in an identical manner to the sedative barbiturate pentobarbitone.", 
    "32": "Increased benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor density has been reported in brains of rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) due to galactosamine (GalN)-induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). These data were generated using detergent-Triton X-100-treated neural membranes. While performing further studies it was noted that the increase in BZ receptor density was not demonstrable when Triton X-100 preparation was not employed. Accordingly the binding of [3H] flunitrazepam, a BZ ligand, to neural membranes from cortices of normal rabbits and rabbits with HE due to (GalN)-induced FHF was studied with and without detergent preparation. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data indicated that when no detergent was employed, the apparent affinity and density of BZ receptors were similar for control membranes and membranes from animals in HE. BZ receptors from animals in HE were shown to be more resistant to solubilization by Triton than control membranes. These findings (a) afford a potential explanation for the apparent increase in density of BZ receptors in this model when Triton treatment of neural membranes is utilized and (b) suggest that recent evidence for increased GABAergic tone in the syndrome of HE is not dependent on an increased density of BZ receptors.", 
    "33": "The rat liver membrane-bound and digitonin-solubilized peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (mPBZR and dsPBZR, respectively) were characterized. Forty percent of the receptors were solubilized from a liver homogenate with 0.25% digitonin. Scatchard analysis of saturation data for the mPBZR and the dsPBZR showed Kd = 1.5 nM and maximum number of binding sites = 3.12 pmol/mg of protein and Kd = 9.2 nM and maximum number of binding sites = 1.10 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. Estimates of Kd calculated from kinetic data agree with estimates from Scatchard analysis. The affinity of the PBZR for [3H]Ro5-4864 was not affected by guanosine 5'0-(3-thiotriphosphate) which suggests the receptor is not coupled to a G-protein. Competition for specific [3H]Ro5-4864 binding by various ligands demonstrated the same rank order potency of binding inhibition for the membrane bound and solubilized receptors (PK-11195 greater than or equal to Ro5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam). Thus, the soluble receptor had ligand binding characteristics similar to those of the membrane PBZR. [3H]PK-14105 was used to photoaffinity label the PBZR in a rat liver homogenate. Labeling was specific for the PBZR and the molecular weight of the digitonin-solubilized photoaffinity-labeled receptor was estimated to be 170 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. Estimation of the molecular weight of the [3H]PK-14105 labeled receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated a single protein corresponding to 19 kDa.", 
    "34": "A recently developed series of pyridazinyl-GABA derivatives has been classified as GABA antagonists in electrophysiological, behavioral and biochemical experiments. These substances seemed superior to the classical GABA antagonist bicuculline because of their water-solubility, high potency and apparent selectivity for GABAA receptors. In the present study the most potent representative of this class, SR 95531 almost completely reversed the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of GABA on [3H]lormetazepam and [35S]TBPS binding, respectively. To a lesser extent, it antagonized the inhibition of [3H]DMCM binding by GABA. However, the interaction of SR 95531 with the GABA receptor seems to be of a complex nature since the compound enhanced the binding of [3H]lormetazepam by 28% at 37 degrees in the presence of 200 mM Cl-. Bicuculline inhibited [3H]lormetazepam binding under these conditions, presumably by antagonizing the effect of residual endogenous GABA. Similar to GABA and THIP, SR 95531 potently inhibited the binding of [3H]DMCM and [35S]TBPS, suggesting SR 95531 to be a partial agonist at the GABAA receptor.", 
    "35": "Indices of clinical recovery were compared with mechanically (adductor pollicis muscle) and electromyographically (first dorsal interosseal muscle) recorded train-of-four (TOF) ratios during antagonism of atracurium blockade in 23 healthy neurolept anesthetized patients. Clinical recovery was evaluated from the ability to lift the head, sustain headlift for 5 or 10 s, protrude the tongue, open the eyes, and the presence of ptosis of the eyelids. In all patients the mechanical TOF ratio was recorded. In 17 patients TOF ratios based on measurements of the potential area and the amplitude of the major negative deflection of the compound EMG response were recorded as well. At each TOF ratio interval of 0.05 from a TOF ratio of 0.5-0.85, the number of patients being able to perform the individual tests was recorded. Further, the mechanical TOF ratio during recovery was compared with the EMG TOF ratios. Headlift could not be sustained for 5 s in any patient at a TOF ratio of 0.5, whether recorded mechanically or by EMG, and TOF ratio had to recover to 0.8 before all patients could sustain headlift for 5 s. All patients could open the eyes and protrude the tongue at a TOF ratio of 0.65, and ptosis remained present during the entire testing period. There was no statistically significant difference between the mechanical and the EMG methods with regard to the TOF ratios at which the tests could be performed. During recovery a linear relationship was found between mechanical TOF ratios and the square root of the EMG TOF ratios.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "This study has used the recently developed in vitro quantitative autoradiographic technique to examine the effects of olfactory bulb (OB) removal on receptor-binding sites in the deafferented piriform cortex (PC) of the rat. The gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor (GABA-BZR)- and muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MChR)-binding sites in layer I of PC were localized using [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate as ligands, respectively. From the resultant autoradiograms the optical densities were measured using a Drexel-DUMAS image analysis system. The densities of BZR and MChR-binding sites were markedly increased in the PC ipsilateral to the lesion as compared to the contralateral side in those subjects that were operated in adulthood (Postnatal Day 100, PN 100). Comparisons between the unoperated and PN 100 operated animals also showed significant increases in the deafferented PC. In the animals operated on the day of birth (PN 0) no significant differences were seen between the operated and the contralateral PC. The difference between the PN 0 deafferented PC and the unoperated controls shows a slight decrease in BZR density in the former group; however, in case of the MChR there is a slight increase on the side of the lesion. These results demonstrate that deafferentation of PC by OB removal appears to modulate both the BZR-binding sites that are coupled with the GABA-A receptor complex and the MChR-binding sites. The results also suggest that possibility of a role for these neurotransmitter receptor-binding sites in plasticity following deafferentation.", 
    "37": "t-[35S]Butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) has been shown to bind to the GABAA receptor complex. The binding is modulated allosterically by drugs that interact at components of the receptor complex. The present studies were designed to evaluate the influence of ionic environment and state of equilibrium on the allosteric modification of [35S]TBPS binding. In both I- and Cl- under nonequilibrium conditions, diazepam, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and pentobarbital (PB) stimulate and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) inhibits [35S]TBPS binding. In addition, there is an inhibitory component to the effect of GABA and PB at higher drug concentrations. These effects are blocked by the appropriate antagonists for each drug. In Cl-, the stimulation of [35S]TBPS binding by drugs disappears at equilibrium, whereas the inhibition by GABA and PB persists. The inhibitory effect of DMCM in Cl- also disappears at equilibrium. When assayed in I- at equilibrium, however, DMCM stimulates [35S]TBPS binding. In addition, bicuculline, which is without effect under nonequilibrium conditions in either Cl- or I-, stimulates [35S]TBPS binding in I- at equilibrium. The persistent effects of DMCM, bicuculline, and GABA in I- are accompanied by alterations in the affinity of [35S]TBPS for its receptor. In addition, the stimulation of [35S]TBPS binding by GABA is associated with a decreased number of [35S]TBPS binding sites. These data demonstrate that receptor complex interactions with anions influence the responsiveness to drug binding.",

The cells possessed high levels of \"peripheral-type\" high-affinity benzodiazepine binding sites as judged by binding assays and displacement potencies. However, the different potencies and specificities of compounds for the antiproliferative actions and binding affinities for the binding site suggest that the antiproliferative actions were not mediated through the peripheral-type binding site. In support of this, these compounds have also been shown to inhibit proliferation of some nonneuronal cultured cell lines, e.g., mouse SP2/O-Ag 14 hybridoma and rat NCTC epithelial cells, which have no detectable high-affinity peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "39": "If increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission contributes to the mediation of hepatic encephalopathy, it may be possible to induce ameliorations of the syndrome by pharmacologically antagonizing a component of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. To test this possibility we administered the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil by intravenous injection to 14 patients with hepatic encephalopathy complicating cirrhosis. Flumazenil administration induced variable and transient, but distinct, improvements of the mental status in 71% of the patients. The degree of encephalopathy improved from stage IV to stage II in 4 patients and from stage IV to stage III in 2 patients. The mental status of all patients with less advanced encephalopathy (3 with stage III, 1 with stage II) also improved, but these responses were clinically less impressive. The arousal effect occurred within minutes after the injection and lasted for 1 to 2 h. Furthermore, it was associated with a significant increase of the mean electroencephalographic frequency from 4.2 to 5.2 cycle/s. Of the 8 patients who were ultimately discharged from the hospital, 7 had responded to flumazenil. No patient who died within 48 h of receiving flumazenil had shown any arousal effect. These findings strongly favor a prominent pathogenetic role of increased GABAergic tone in hepatic encephalopathy in humans and suggest that a positive response to flumazenil might be of prognostic value in predicting short-term survival in encephalopathic patients with liver disease.",

The composition of AP-1 nucleoprotein complexes changes with time after seizure as a result of the sequential appearance and disappearance of Fos and several Fos-related proteins. Although these changes occur over an 8 hr time period, they are triggered by 15 min of seizure. Alterations in the levels and composition of transcription factors may represent one of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal adaptation.", 
    "43": "Repeated exposure to pain under the influence of the opiate antagonists naloxone and naltrexone leads to the recruitment of substantial analgesia as measured by paw-lick latency on the hot-plate test (4,11). One hypothesis to explain this naloxone-induced analgesia (NIA) is that nociceptive stimulation in the face of opiate blockade becomes stressful enough to activate an analgesic adaptation that otherwise would not occur. This hypothesis was examined in two experiments by the administration of a benzodiazepine antagonist with anxiogenic properties (Ro 15-1788, in a dose of 10 mg/kg) in conjunction with repeated administrations of naloxone (5 mg/kg). One experiment incorporated defecation as a relatively direct measure of stress. Ro 15-1788 reliably augmented NIA. Defecation was increased by naloxone alone and in combination with Ro 15-1788. Overall, the results were most consistent with the hypothesis that NIA is a form of stress-induced analgesia that is at least partly nonopiate in nature.", 
    "44": "In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, thirty patients who had received flunitrazepam during operation were divided into three groups. At the end of surgery, one group was given a placebo, one group was given Ro 15-1788 (Benzodiazepine antagonist) and a third group was given physostigmine. Each group was assessed at the end of 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes 60 minutes and 120 minutes for alertness/sedation, recall, recognition and motor coordination. At the end of 5 and 15 minutes, the patients who had received Ro 15-1788 showed a statistically significant difference in alertness/sedation from those in the other two groups (p less than 0.01). This group also showed a statistically significant difference in motor coordination at the end of 5 minutes (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in recognition or recall at anytime. Physostigmine showed no significant difference change from the control group at anytime in every aspect. In conclusion, Ro 15-1788 is an effective antagonist to the alertness/sedation of flunitrazepam, but physostigmine is not.", 
    "45": "The effect of three anticonvulsants on several test methods for evaluation of memory-enhancing drugs have been studied in rats and mice. The results were compared to the results obtained from the nootropic piracetam and from imipramine. In an active avoidance test (pole jumping), repeated administration of carbamazepine (5 mg/kg i.p.) and piracetam (300 mg/kg p.o.) protected against impairment of learning rate caused by repeated application of an electroconvulsive shock. Valproate calcium (repeated administration of 30 mg/kg i.p.) was only weakly active, while clonazepam (repeated administration of 0.3 mg/kg i.p.) decreased the learning rate even more. Drugs were given in dosages which have no anticonvulsive activity in this test. The impairment of learning rate caused by repeated application of ethanol was prevented by carbamazepine (5 mg/kg i.p.), valproate calcium (30 and 100 mg/kg i.p.) and piracetam (100 mg/kg i.p.). Clonazepam (0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) had a worsening effect on learning rate. In Porsolt's behavioral despair test, carbamazepine (5, 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) and valproate calcium (30 and 100 mg/kg i.p.) shortened the duration of immobility, which indicates an increased psychomotor activity. Clonazepam was ineffective. Results obtained with carbamazepine are similar to those obtained with piracetam. The data are discussed in view of the so-called psychotropic effects of carbamazepine in clinical trials.", 
    "46": "The effects of ethanol and diazepam were examined in long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice using the elevated plus-maze. Ethanol had more pronounced effects in SS mice than in LS mice. In contrast, LS mice were more sensitive to the effects of diazepam on the elevated plus-maze. The ataxic effects of ethanol were measured by rotarod performance. SS mice were more resistant to the ataxic effects of a 2.0 g/kg dose of ethanol than LS mice. Ro 15-4513 reversed ethanol's ataxic effects when administered after ethanol in both LS mice and SS mice. Pentobarbital-induced ataxia was unaffected by treatment with Ro 15-4513.

During the operation 2 l/min oxygen was administered via a nasal cannula; pO2 and pCO2 remained within normal limits throughout the procedure.

    "50": "Flumazenil, a new and specific benzodiazepine antagonist that appears to be free of intrinsic pharmacologic action, is extensively metabolized by oxidative processes and represents a high-clearance drug. Consequently, it could be anticipated that hepatic disease affects the elimination and oral bioavailability of flumazenil. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of flumazenil was evaluated in eight patients who had moderate cirrhosis and in eight age-matched healthy volunteers after a single oral dose (30 mg) and after an intravenous dose (2 mg). The mean half-life (t1/2) was 0.8 versus 1.4 hours (p = 0.003) and total plasma clearance was 1201 versus 705 ml per minute (p = 0.009) for control subjects versus patients with cirrhosis. Bioavailability increased from the normal 28% to 65% (p = 0.001) in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Routine liver tests did not correlate with the elimination of flumazenil in individual patients. It can be concluded that elimination of flumazenil is impaired in patients who have stable alcoholic cirrhosis. Despite the relative wide margin of safety of flumazenil, somewhat lower doses could be effective in such patients if long-term oral use is anticipated.", 
    "51": "Binding of TRH to specific cell surface receptors on clonal GH4C1 cells is followed within 10 min by receptor sequestration and over 24 h by receptor down-regulation. These experiments were designed to determine if TRH-activated second messenger systems are responsible for changes in receptor localization or number. BAY K8644 and A23187, which increase intracellular calcium, alone or together with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C, did not appear to internalize TRH receptors. Drug treatment did not alter the rate of [3H]MeTRH association or internalization, determined by resistance to an acid/salt wash, or the amount of [3H]MeTRH able to bind at 0 C, where only surface receptors are accessible. TPA (0-100 nM) alone or in combination with BAY K8644 or A23187, also failed to change receptor number or affinity after 48 h when TRH caused a 75% decrease in the density of specific binding sites. Chlordiazepoxide has been reported antagonize TRH binding and TRH-induced phospholipid breakdown. Chlordiazepoxide shifted the dose-response curves for TRH stimulation of PRL release and synthesis to the right, and did not change PRL release alone. The affinity of receptors for chlordiazepoxide was not affected by a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP whereas affinity for TRH was decreased; these properties are consistent with the classification of chlordiazepoxide as a competitive antagonist. Several experiments tested whether chlordiazepoxide would cause receptor internalization and down-regulation. Chlordiazepoxide did not appear to internalize TRH receptors, because TRH-binding sites became available rapidly and at the same rate after they had been saturated with chlordiazepoxide at 0 or 37 C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "(1) The stimulation of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) release by FG 7142 was found to be 50% inhibited in capsaicin-desensitized rats indicating that the excitatory effect of this inverse benzodiazepine agonist is partly mediated through capsaicin-sensitive afferents. (2) The in vitro release of substance P from spinal cord slices was stimulated in a tetrodotoxin-resistant manner by FG 7142. No stimulation of the substance R release by FG 7142 was observed when spinal cord slices were taken from capsaicin-pretreated rats which lack afferent C-fibres. (3) Ro 15-1788 antagonized the in vivo as well as the in vitro stimulatory effects of FG 7142 indicating that they were brought about by interaction with benzodiazepine receptors.

    "53": "The possibility that differences in beta-adrenergic sensitivity among canine trachealis muscles contracted with different contractile agonists are related to differences in the receptor-occupancy characteristics of the contractile agonists was investigated. Relaxation to isoproterenol was compared in muscles contracted with the muscarinic agonists McN-A-343 and acetylcholine (ACh). The apparent dissociation constant (pKB) values for the M1-antagonist, pirenzepine, against ACh (6.96 +/- 0.18) and McN-A-343 (6.84 +/- 0.08) were similar. The pKB values for the M3-antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) against ACh (8.76 +/- 0.13) and McN-A-343 (8.71 +/- 0.10) were also similar, suggesting that these agonists were activating the same subtype of muscarinic receptor, probably M3. However, the contractile response to ACh was associated with a greater receptor reserve than that for McN-A-343. Isoproterenol relaxed muscles contracted with McN-A-343 much more effectively than those contracted with an equieffective concentration of ACh. The results suggest that the relative resistance of ACh-induced contractions to relaxation by isoproterenol may not be an inherent quality of muscarinic receptor stimulation. The large receptor reserve available to ACh may act to buffer the contractile response from the inhibitory effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Alternatively, ACh may be able to initiate subcellular mechanisms that are unavailable to agonists of lower efficacy.", 
    "54": "Transmitter amino acid receptors (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] and excitatory amino acids) include in their structure allosteric modulatory centers that regulate the probability of transmitter action. These are sites of action for drugs. In GABA receptors, benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines act as positive and negative modulators. Various subtypes of GABAA receptors exist that differ with regard to the structure of the receptor subunits and the characteristic of the allosteric modulatory centers. This brings up the possibility that classes of benzodiazepines exist that, by acting selectively on specific subtypes of GABAA receptors, may bring about selectivity of drug action in specific anxiety disorders. For instance, clonazepam appears to act better than diazepam on panic attacks and fails to bind to GABAA receptor subtypes located in spinal cord. Also, glutamate receptors and specifically the N-methyl-D-aspartate-sensitive subtype modulated by an allosteric center may include various molecular forms differing with respect to the properties of the allosteric modulatory center. This variability suggests that this center may be used as a target for discovery of drugs acting as specific allosteric modulators of glutamate receptors.", 
    "55": "Cl- currents elicited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) application were recorded with the whole-cell tight-seal technique from voltage-clamped cortical neurons of neonatal rats in primary culture. The peripheral benzodiazepine recognition site ligand 4'-chlorodiazepam [Ro 5-4864; 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2H-[1,4]-benzodiazep in-2- one] inhibited the GABA-generated currents in a dose-dependent manner. Also, a beta-carboline (DMCM; 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester), acting as a negative allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, reduced the intensity of GABA-generated currents with similar efficacy but greater potency. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; 8-fluro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo-[1,5-a] [1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate ethyl ester) antagonized DMCM inhibition but not that elicited by 4'-chlorodiazepam. The isoquinoline carboxamide PK 11195, an antagonist of 4'-chlorodiazepam effects in other systems, failed to antagonize the action of 4'-chlorodiazepam. The transient expression of various molecular forms of GABAA receptors in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 allowed a study of the minimal structural requirements for the inhibition of GABA-induced Cl- currents by bicuculline, picrotoxin, 4'-chlorodiazepam, and DMCM. GABA-elicited Cl- currents in cells coexpressing alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of GABAA receptors were inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxin, but not by DMCM or 4'-chlorodiazepam. Conversely, the GABA currents in cells coexpressing alpha 1 beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits were inhibited by bicuculline, picrotoxin, 4'-chlorodiazepam, and DMCM. Since the Cl- currents generated by GABA in some molecular forms of GABAA receptors are inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxin only, 4'-chlorodiazepam cannot be acting isosterically with picrotoxin.",

The ability of several benzodiazepine and isoquinolinecarboxamide compounds, including a pair of enantiomers, to inhibit [3H]Ro5-4864 binding to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site in rat aortic smooth muscle was compared with their relative ability to induce relaxation of rat aortic rings. The binding was performed in a membrane fraction obtained from a pellet centrifuged at 11,400 g and enriched with high-affinity [3H]Ro5-4864 binding. The rank order of potency (Ki) for inhibition of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding to isolated membranes was: (-)PK 14067 (6.4 +/- 0.7 nM) = PK 11195 (6.6 +/- 0.8 nM) greater than Ro5-4864 (17.6 +/- 2.1 nM) greater than diazepam (600 +/- 180 nM) = (+)PK 14068 (530 +/- 70 nM) greater than clonazepam (14,300 +/- 2,100 nM). However, micromolar concentrations of these agents were required to induce relaxation of rat aortic rings contracted with KCl and/or norepinephrine (NE). Moreover, the relaxations induced by these agents were not stereoselective.

Behavioral signs of sedation and excitation were scored for 1 h after i.m. injections. Daily administration of these benzodiazepine-receptor ligands differentiated their behavioral effects; repeated midazolam resulted in tolerance to the sedative and ataxic effects; repeated beta CCE resulted in sensitization to its convulsant properties; and repeated flumazenil or saline produced no changes in behavior. In a second study, baboons received repeated injections of midazolam (5.6, 11.2 or 20 mg/kg per day) for 6 days. All three groups became tolerant to the sedative and ataxic effects of midazolam. Acute injections of flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) on day 5 produced a dose-dependent withdrawal syndrome. This flumazenil treatment produced a slight attenuation in the degree of tolerance to midazolam on day 6, suggesting that receptor sensitivity to the benzodiazepine agonist may have partially reset.",

The duration of paradoxical sleep was particularly increased resembling the effects of benzodiazepines. In chloralose anesthesia, a similar increase in GABA concentration in the thalamus induced a tonic decrease in the peak-to-peak amplitude of cortical event-related potentials evoked by stimulation of the radial nerve. Following 10-15 min of inhibition during which the responses were as small as 20% of the original ones, the potentials started to recover.

We have examined both in vivo and in vitro tyrosine hydroxylation in the PFC and other mesotelencephalic DA system terminal fields in order to determine if FG-7142 effects changes in DA synthesis, and to determine if the beta-carboline biochemically activates certain DA neurons through an action occurring at the cell body level (impulse-dependent regulation) or at the terminal field level (presynaptic regulation). FG-7142 increased in vivo tyrosine hydroxylation in the PFC and in the ventral tegmental area, midbrain source of the DA innervation of the PFC; no changes were observed in mesolimbic or nigrostriatal regions. The beta-carboline also increased in vitro tyrosine hydroxylation in the PFC, but decreased tyrosine hydroxylation in striatal slices. The effects of FG-7142 were blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788. Another beta-carboline inverse agonist, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboline-3-carboxylate, also increased in vitro tyrosine hydroxylation in the PFC. GABA exerted opposite effects to those of the beta-carbolines, decreasing in vitro tyrosine hydroxylation in the PFC and increasing DA synthesis in the CP. These data indicate that the benzodiazepine inverse agonists increase both in vivo and in vitro tyrosine hydroxylation in the PFC, and that the beta-carboline may act to increase DA synthesis at both the terminal field and the cell body level.", 
    "63": "We have investigated the influence of central noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems on the susceptibility of rats to seizures in the kainic acid (KA)-model of epilepsy. In the dose range of 0.75 to 10 mg/kg s.c., KA dose-dependently induced characteristic behavioural changes. Partial depletion of noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) in the brain by pretreatment with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT; 250 mg/kg, i.p.) markedly potentiated KA-induced epileptic symptoms. A low dose of KA (1.5 mg/kg s.c.), which was ineffective in normal rats, triggered in AMPT-pretreated rats a high incidence of wet dog shakes (WDS) and a seizure activity (seizure rating: 3.17 +/- 0.31) which was comparable in degree to that resulting from 10 mg/kg KA in rats with normal catecholamine synthesis (seizure rating: 3.33 +/- 0.28). In AMPT-pretreated rats a higher dose of KA (10 mg/kg) further enhanced seizure activity and was associated with a mortality rate of up to 80%. Within 6.5 h after AMPT-pretreatment the levels of NA and DA in amygdala/pyriform cortex declined from 0.56 +/- 0.02 (control) to 0.23 +/- 0.01 ng/mg tissue and from 0.21 +/- 0.03 to 0.05 +/- 0.01 ng/mg tissue, respectively. At a dose of 1.5 mg/kg KA was ineffective on the levels of NA and DA in normal rats, but further reduced these levels in AMPT-pretreated rats to 0.08 +/- 0.02 and 0.020 +/- 0.004 ng/mg tissue, respectively. Induction of seizure activity and decline in NA and DA levels in amygdala/pyriform cortex after AMPT/KA (1.5 mg/kg) treatment was antagonized by the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "A dialysis loop cannula was implanted into rat striatum under anesthetized condition, and the area was perfused with Ringer's solution under freely moving condition after 3 days for surgical recovery. Dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid recovered in the dialysate were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The effects of M1- and M2-muscarinic receptor agents, which were perfused continuously into the striatum through the dialysis membrane, were investigated. Continuous perfusion of AF102B, an M1-selective agonist, and oxotremorine, a non-selective agonist, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the striatal DA release. Pirenzepine (10(-5) and 10(-7) M), an M1-selective antagonist, decreased the release of DA, and the stimulatory effect of AF102B (10(-5) M) was completely inhibited by 10(-5) and 10(-7) M pirenzepine, while the stimulatory effect of oxotremorine (10(-4) M) was only partly inhibited by 10(-5) M pirenzepine. AF-DX116 (10(-5) M), an M2-selective antagonist, increased the DA release, and showed an additive effect on the DA release evoked by AF102B (10(-5) M), whereas it produced no significant effect on oxotremorine (10(-5) M)-evoked DA release. These results suggest that in vivo DA release in the rat striatum is modulated by different subtypes of muscarinic receptors; i.e., the stimulatory effect is mainly mediated by M1-sites and inhibitory effect is mainly mediated by M2-sites. The changes in the DA release induced by the various drugs were prevented by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin (TTX). Since action potential-dependent DA release (exocytosis) is blocked by the pretreatment with TTX, those drugs affect DA release by means of action potential-dependent processes.", 
    "65": "The effects of GYKI 52466, a new 2,3-benzodiazepine with muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties, were investigated and compared to those of midazolam in electrophysiological experiments. The effects of the drugs on the reflex potentials evoked by afferent nerve stimulation and recorded from the spinal roots in unanesthetized spinal cats were studied. GYKI 52466 exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the monosynaptic as well as the polysynaptic ventral root reflexes, while the dorsal root responses decreased slightly. In contrast, midazolam markedly enhanced the dorsal root responses, did not modify the monosynaptic reflex and partially inhibited the polysynaptic reflex. The spontaneous firing of cerebellar Purkinje cells was depressed by midazolam, but not by GYKI 52466. These results suggest strongly that, contrary to the classical 1,4-benzodiazepines, potentiation of the GABA-A receptor-mediated inhibition does not play a significant role in the pharmacological actions of GYKI 52466.", 
    "66": "On January 1st 1986, all hypnotics and sedatives containing barbiturates were removed from the Danish Drug Register. After one year, a follow-up investigation of previous barbiturate users was undertaken with the object of investigating the significance of various factors for cessation or continuation of use of psychotropic drugs in connection with the removal of barbiturates from the Danish Drug Register. The investigation was carried out of a questionnaire investigation in general practice with participation of 82 practices. Information was obtained concerning 141 previous barbiturate users. Twenty-four of these had stopped (17%, 95% confidence limits 11-23) having psychotropic drugs prescribed during the course of the year in question. In particular, patients without or with slight mental conditions ceased using drugs (p = 0.02). An age and sex stratified analysis revealed that more patients who had obtained the preparation by direct doctor-patient contact stopped the habit (odds ratio 3.00, 95% confidence limits 1.04-8.61). Other factors were without significant significance for continued use or cessation, respectively. In 75% of the patients, adjustment was, in the opinion of the general practitioner, easy. Out of 105 patients who continued to have psychotropic drugs prescribed and where the preparation employed was known, 90 (86%) were prescribed benzodiazepines.", 
    "67": "On the basis of an investigation of prescriptions of tranquillizers and hypnotics for individuals resident in the Municipality of Holbaek, a description was made of which tranquillizers and which hypnotics were prescribed and the quantities provided. 96% of the prescriptions were written by the general practitioners in the town. Only 2% of the patients had obtained medicine from various doctors. Benzodiazepine derivatives constituted 93% of all tranquilizers and 96% of the hypnotics prescribed. Diazepam, nitrazepam and triazolam were the preparations most frequently prescribed. Diazepam, flunitrazepam and the older hypnotics were prescribed in quantities which suggested that these preparations were preferred by chronic users with massive drug intake. The smallest portions available were employed for 17% of the prescriptions for tranquillizers and in 2% of the prescriptions for hypnotics. The favourite amount prescribed was 100 tablets. Where triazolam was concerned, strikingly high defined daily dosages were prescribed. As only brief or episodic use is rational, half of all the tranquilizers and four out of five prescriptions for hypnotics are considered unsuitable.", 
    "68": "In a multicentre-questionnaire investigation in general practice in the County of Arhus with participation of 66% of the general practitioners in the county, 1,516 prescriptions for hypnotics were registered during one week. 68% of the prescriptions were for women and 32% for men. The average ages of the patients were 65 and 64 years, respectively. The frequency of prescription increased markedly with age. 83% of the prescriptions and 85% of the hypnotics calculated in defined daily doses were benzodiazepines. The majority of the benzodiazepine hypnotics and sedatives prescribed had long half-lives. At the time of the first prescription of hypnotic, 31% of the patients were in a state of mental crisis while only 7% were so after medication for at least six years. In about 30% of the patients, a co-existing somatic disease contributed to a considerable extent to the prescription of the hypnotic while under 1/5 of the patients suffered from genuine mental illness. Approximately 20% of the patients were considered to be potential or genuine addicts. More than 80% of the renewed prescriptions occurred by indirect doctor-patient contact.", 
    "69": "Prescription of psychotropic drugs by general practitioners was registered by means of a multicenter-questionnaire investigation in the County of Arhus. A total of 227 doctors registered 4,180 prescriptions to 3,756 patients during one week. The sex ratio (m/f) was 0.5, calculated not only from the number of prescriptions but also from the defined daily doses (DDD). The frequencies of prescribing increased markedly with age so that for men and women in the age group 70+, these were 188 and 322 DDD/1,000 of the population per 24 hours, respectively. Benzodiazepines constituted 67.3% of all of the prescriptions and 76.9% of the prescribed DDD while neuroleptics constituted 13.6% and 3.9% and antidepressives 9.5% and 7.0%, respectively. Neuroleptics were prescribed in doses of about 1/5 DDD. About 50% of the first prescriptions but only 17% of the renewed prescriptions were undertaken by direct doctor-patient contact in connection with consultations or visits in the home. Prescription of psychotropic drug by general practitioners is estimated to constitute just under 90% of the psychotropic drug in the County of Arhus.", 
    "70": "This paper reviews the discovery and characterization of a behavioural system for entrainment of circadian rhythms. This behavioural system depends on non-photic inputs but interacts with the light-entrainment system. Non-photic stimuli can be powerful quantitatively: behavioural events can shift rhythms by several hours. Non-photic entrainment offers scope for rephasing biological rhythms in circumstances where light input from the environment is inadequate.", 
    "71": "The technique of radiotracer 36Cl- influx in primary culture of rat cerebellar granule cells was applied to study the mechanism of inactivation of the GABAA receptor-activated chloride channel. During sustained application of GABA, muscimol and THIP the specific bicuculline-sensitive 36Cl- influx tends to decline with time. The sequence in decay half-time is GABA less than muscimol less than THIP. Diazepam accelerates the rate of decay of the peak response to GABA. (-)-Baclofen enhances the rate of decline of the response to muscimol in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin antagonized the effect of (-)-baclofen. It is concluded that rat neonatal cerebellar neurons maintained in tissue culture exhibit complex inactivation of the GABAA channel, indicating some interaction with the GABAB receptor system.", 
    "72": "Diazepam (DZ), N-desmethyl diazepam (NOR) and temazepam (TEM) were used as substrates in drug metabolism studies to characterize the changes in cytochrome P-450 mono-oxygenase pathways in hepatocytes isolated from cynomolgus monkeys, during culture for 6 days. Hepatocytes were incubated with DZ (20 microM), NOR (6 microM) or TEM (20 microM) for 3 hr at 3, 24, 48, 96 and 144 hr post-isolation in culture, and the profiles of disappearance of DZ, as substrate, and appearance of its metabolites determined. Major metabolites were NOR, TEM and oxazepam (OX). The kinetic profiles for the disappearance of DZ and the accumulation of metabolite were analysed using a four-compartment model and constants for the rates of formation of the metabolites were derived. There were significant changes during the period in culture for the rate constants of DZ demethylation, but no alteration in the 3-hydroxylation activities. Rates of DZ metabolism were unchanged during the initial 2 days in culture and well maintained for the subsequent 4 days, despite a fall in total cytochrome P-450 to 23% of initial values after 6 days. Cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes produce similar metabolite profiles for DZ to those found in man, both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes may represent a relatively stable and valuable model of human drug metabolism.", 
    "73": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide, chlorpromazine, diazepam, diphenylhydantoin, flunitrazepam and haloperidol on the voltage-dependent sodium current (INa) were studied on the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, isolated acutely from rats, using a concentration clamp technique. The drugs used here reduced dose-dependently the peak amplitude of INa without affecting its current-voltage relationship. Chlorpromazine was most potent drug inhibiting the INa among them. Chlorpromazine and diphenylhydantoin at the concentration of half inhibition (IC50; 4 x 10(-6) M and 2 x 10(-4) M, respectively) shifted the steady state inactivation curve by more than 20 mV to a hyperpolarizing direction. Both drugs also caused a use-dependent inhibition of the INa. These results suggest that the drugs may block preferentially the inactivated sodium channels. While the concentrations of the drugs for inhibiting the INa are thought to be higher than those for affecting respective receptors for neurotransmitters, the results presented here may provide useful information to elucidate additional modes of action of these drugs in mammalian central nervous system.", 
    "74": "The interaction of the antimuscarinic drug telenzepine with muscarinic receptors was studied in rabbit and rat isolated superior cervical sympathetic ganglia. Radioligand binding demonstrated two muscarinic receptor sites in rabbit ganglia, with the characteristics of M1- and M2-receptors. Telenzepine bound to the M1 sites with a KI of 0.94 nmol/l and to the M2 sites with a KI of 17.8 nmol/l; the corresponding values for pirenzepine were 18.6 and 588 nmol/l; for AF-DX 116 the values were 891 and 33 nmol/l respectively. [3H]Telenzepine dissociated from the M1-receptors with a half time of 46 min at 37 degrees C. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that telenzepine reduced the amplitude of the extracellularly recorded slow excitatory postsynaptic potential and the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (ED50: 38 and 253 nmol/l respectively). In rat ganglia, application of muscarine or the M1-receptor agonist McN-A-343 increased the amplitude of submaximal population action potentials. This facilitation of synaptic transmission was potently blocked by telenzepine and pirenzepine but only weakly by AF-DX 116 (ED50: ca. 30, 150 and 20 mumol/l, respectively). It is concluded that telenzepine blocks the generation of the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential and the excitatory action of muscarine and McN-A-343 via an action on muscarinic M1-receptors.", 
    "75": "Ro5-4864, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide inhibited the concanavalin A-induced [14C]serotonin release from rat mast cells dose dependently with IC30 values 38, 115 and 160 microM, respectively. They also inhibited concanavalin A-induced 45Ca uptake, with IC50 values 180, 860 and 1800 microM, respectively. Clonazepam slightly inhibited serotonin release, but medazepam did not, and neither compound inhibited the calcium uptake stimulated by concanavalin A. The potencies of benzodiazepines to inhibit concanavalin A-induced serotonin release and 45Ca uptake were correlated with their binding affinities to the peripheral type of benzodiazepine binding sites. At higher concentrations, these benzodiazepines caused release of both serotonin and lactate dehydrogenase, due to their cytotoxicity. The calcium channels of mast cells are probably not voltage-dependent, as the agonists of voltage-dependent calcium channels, Bay k 8644 and YC-170, did not stimulate serotonin release. Moreover, Ro5-4864, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide inhibited A23187-induced serotonin release. Mast cells have high contents of calmodulin (602 +/- 20 ng/10(6) cells), and benzodiazepines inhibited calmodulin. The benzodiazepine inhibitory effects on the serotonin release induced by A23187 seemed to be partly due to their calmodulin-inhibiting activities. These results suggest that inhibition of serotonin release by benzodiazepines in mast cells activated by concanavalin A is mainly due to inhibition of calcium channels, which may be controlled by the peripheral type of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "76": "In rat cortical synaptoneurosomes, the maximum potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl uptake produced by 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol (5 alpha-pregnanediol) is significantly less than that elicited by 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP). This observation suggests that 5 alpha-pregnanediol may be a partial agonist whereas 3 alpha-OH-DHP acts as a full agonist at a common site on or near the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex (GBRC). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that 5 alpha-pregnanediol will antagonize in a dose-dependent manner the enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl uptake produced by 3 alpha-OH-DHP under certain conditions. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that GBRC-active progesterone metabolites with varying degrees of efficacy exist as reflected by their differential ability to potentiate 36Cl uptake in brain synaptoneurosomes.", 
    "77": "GABA/benzodiazepine coupling was evaluated in 8 regions of rat brain by the ability of GABA to stimulate 0.5 nM [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Rats were treated acutely with diazepam (p.o) or chronically with flurazepam, offered in the drinking water for 4 weeks, and compared to a pair-handled vehicle-treated control group. Regional variations in GABA/benzodiazepine coupling were found in control membranes. GABA increased benzodiazepine binding maximally (40%) in cerebellum and medulla, and least (25%) in olfactory bulb. A significant decrease in the effect of GABA was found in cortex of chronically treated rats immediately after, but not 2 days following treatment. The Emax for GABA stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was significantly increased in medulla after acute treatment but was not altered after acute or chronic treatment in other brain areas evaluated. Treatment had no effect on the ability of bicuculline to inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding in cortex. Benzodiazepine/Cl- coupling in cortex or hippocampus of acutely and chronically treated rats, evaluated by the ability of Cl- to stimulate specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding, was not changed. The results support the hypothesis that a functional uncoupling of the benzodiazepine recognition site from the GABA receptor in cortex, but not from the anion recognition site, may play a role in tolerance development.", 
    "78": "The general aim of the present series of experiments was to investigate the effects of the imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro 15-4513, on ingestional behavior in the rat. The more specific aims were to test its effects on preference for sweet taste, to determine if it acts as a benzodiazepine-receptor inverse agonist, and if it selectively reduces sweetness preference. The results indicated that Ro 15-4513 (1.0-10 mg/kg, i.p.) abolished the preference for a 0.05% sodium saccharin solution in a two-choice test. Water intake in the same test was unaffected. Second, at 10 mg/kg, it suppressed saccharin ingestion in an acceptance test; this effect was completely reversed by the selective benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (20 mg/kg). Third, Ro 15-4513 (1.0-10 mg/kg) reduced palatable food consumption in non-deprived rats, an effect which was also antagonized by Ro 15-1788. The results are consistent the bidirectional modulation of ingestional responses to palatable taste stimuli as a consequence of drug actions at benzodiazepine receptors. Furthermore, they emphasize that any reduction in consummatory responses produced by Ro 15-4513 is likely to reflect inverse agonist characteristics, as distinct from any putative ethanol antagonist property.", 
    "79": "The muscarinic receptors of rat submaxillary gland, rat heart and rat cortex were directly labeled using the ligand [3H]4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide [( 3H]4DAMP). In the rat submaxillary gland, [3H]4DAMP predominantly bound with high affinity (Kd = 0.2 nM) to a population of binding sites that displayed the pharmacology of the M3 muscarinic receptor subtype. In rat heart, [3H]4DAMP labeled the M2 muscarinic receptor with low affinity (Kd = 4 nM). In rat cortex [3H]4DAMP predominantly bound to a population of sites with high affinity (Kd = 0.2 nM). The pharmacology of these sites was consistent with [3H]4DAMP labeling both M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors present in rat cortex with high affinity. These data indicate that [3H]4DAMP represents a useful ligand for selectively labeling the M1 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "80": "Effects of selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, atipamezole and idazoxan, on ethanol-induced hypothermia were investigated in mice. Ethanol significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) core temperature whilst both alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists were without effect when administered alone. However, both the 1 and 3 mg/kg doses of atipamezole significantly (P less than 0.05) attenuated the ethanol-induced reduction in body temperature 20 and 40 min after administration. The 3 mg/kg dose of idazoxan (but not the 1 mg/kg dose) also significantly (P less than 0.05) attenuated ethanol's hypothermic effect 20 min after administration but this effect was not statistically significant at 40 min. In a subsequent experiment using lower doses of atipamezole (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) the attenuation of ethanol-induced hypothermia caused by atipamezole was found to be dose-related. The effect of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 on ethanol-induced hypothermia was also investigated. This compound possessed an intrinsic hypothermic action but neither attenuated nor enhanced the hypothermic effect of ethanol. These results suggest that alpha 2-adrenoceptor can, at least partially, modulate the hypothermic effects of ethanol.", 
    "81": "Photolabelling of benzodiazepine receptors isolated from rat cortex with a new beta-carboline-type photoaffinity label, ethyl 6-azido-beta-carboline-3-carboxylase, at 254 nm produced a 42% decrease in the maximal number of propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding sites but practically no decrease in the number of flunitrazepam binding sites. Moreover, the binding affinity of ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylase was diminished 11-fold by photolabelling while that of diazepam was diminished less than 2-fold. These results provide additional evidence that beta-carbolines and benzodiazepines bind to discrete sites on the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "82": "The neurochemical profile of GBR 12909 (1-(2-bis(4-fluorphenyl)-methoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-propyl)pipera zine) was investigated. GBR 12909 was a potent and selective inhibitor of synaptosomal dopamine uptake (KI = 1 nM), with a 20-fold lower affinity for the histamine H1-receptor and a more than 100-fold affinity for the noradrenaline and 5-HT uptake carriers, the dopamine D-1, D-2, 5-HT2, 5-HT1A and alpha 1-receptors and voltage-dependent sodium channels. GBR 12909 (3 microM) was without effect on muscarinic, alpha 2, beta 1 + 2, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors, and on choline and GABA uptake carriers. The selective dopamine uptake inhibitory profile of GBR 12909 was confirmed by ex vivo uptake experiments. GBR 12909 inhibited uptake in vitro in a competitive manner as did cocaine and methylphenidate. [3H]GBR 12935 binding was competitively inhibited by GBR 12909 as well as by dopamine, cocaine and methylphenidate. Off-rate analysis of the [3H]GBR 12935 binding excluded the presence of allosteric binding sites on the dopamine carrier complex. Instead, the data favored the notion that GBR 12909 inhibits dopamine uptake by binding to the dopamine binding site on the carrier protein itself, thereby blocking the carrier process. In conclusion, GBR 12909 is a highly selective inhibitor of dopamine uptake, both in vivo and in vitro. At the moment GBR 12909 is the only compound with this neurochemical profile. The selective effect of GBR 12909 on this neuronal system makes it an interesting experimental tool and a potential antidepressant agent.", 
    "83": "The effect of a convulsive agent, 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), on the GABA-induced chloride current (ICl) in dissociated mouse sensory neurons was investigated using the whole cell clamp method. Trp-P-2 reversibly suppressed the GABA-induced ICl in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 for Trp-P-2 on the ICl evoked by 3 microM GABA was 11.1 microM. Ro15-1788 had no effect on the suppressive action of Trp-P-2. These results suggest that the observed effect of Trp-P-2 is mediated by its action as an antagonist at GABAA receptors.", 
    "84": "The acid-base equilibria of a series of benzodiazepines in acetonitrile have been studied, and pK(HB+) values determined. The theory of such titrations is discussed and simple potentiometric and visual methods in acetonitrile media are proposed for the assay of benzodiazepines in pharmaceutical formulations.", 
    "85": "1. 1-(2-Chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (RP 52028), an antagonist of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites, a potential anticonvulsant, has been shown to have an inducing effect on drug-metabolizing enzymes. 2. RP 52028 was administered orally at 20-800 mg/kg for 1 week, and enzymic activities were determined using a panel of substrates. Western blot analyses were performed using several specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against cytochrome P-450 isozymes. 3. RP 52028 appears to be an inducer of cytochrome P-450 II B1 (P-450b) and related enzymic activities; i.e. benzphetamine, ethylmorphine and aminopyrine demethylation.", 
    "86": "Midazolam 0.2mg.kg-1 or diazepam 0.2mg.kg-1 was used as an induction agent in a modified NLA. Plasma concentrations of midazolam or diazepam were measured with benzodiazepines screen method, which was based on enzyme immunoassay. Pharmacokinetic analysis is based on the plasma concentration-time courses after a bolus injection. The distribution half-life (T alpha 1/2) of midazolam, 1.24 minutes, was shorter than that of diazepam, 3.85 minutes. The elimination half-life (T beta 1/2) of midazolam, 5.44 hours, was similar to that of diazepam, 5.02 hours. The initial fall-off in the alpha-phase was due to the distribution of the drug from plasma to the peripheral compartment, while the drop in the beta-phase was caused by redistribution from the peripheral compartment and total elimination of the drug. Midazolam was thought to be useful as an induction agent in a modified NLA, because midazolam is distributed to the peripheral compartment faster than diazepam. As midazolam has a long elimination half-life as that of diazepam, prolongation of its effects has to be considered when a large dose or continuous infusion is employed."
