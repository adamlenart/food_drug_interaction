    "0": "Cats trained under a fixed-interval 5-min schedule of milk presentation were injected with diazepam, amphetamine, and combinations of amphetamine and diazepam. Diazepam increased overall response rate as a function of the dose and disrupted the temporal pattern of responding. Low doses of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) usually increased the response rate; higher doses (1 to 2 mg/kg) either decreased the response rate or had little effect. Amphetamine always disrupted the temporal pattern of responding, even though it did not affect the overall rate. When doses of amphetamine that increased the response rate or left it unchanged were combined with diazepam, a potentiated increase in response rate occurred. When doses of amphetamine that decreased the response rate were combined with diazepam, the amphetamine-induced rate decreases were reversed at least partially. Less clear potentiation of disruption of the temporal pattern of responding was observed when amphetamine and diazepam were combined.", 
    "1": "Conditioned suppression of feeding, an index of fear, was increased rather than decreased by the administration of benzodiazepine tranquilizers or amobarbital. The drug-induced increase in conditioned fear varied directly with the intensity of the shock used in fear conditioning. The drugs had no fear-increasing effect in unshocked controls or in rats made amnesic by electroconvulsive shock given immediately after fear conditioning. These observations in animals are reminiscent of clinical reports that intraveneous amobarbital facilitates the recall of repressed traumatic experiences. The retrieval of painful memories may be inhibited or repressed in animals as well as in humans. In both cases, tranquilizers may counteract repression by disinhibition of the act of retrieval."
