If locoregional anesthesia is chosen, the state of awareness of the patient allows for direct viewing of the effect of vascular clamping of the corresponding neurological territory. We present the results of an anesthetic procedure using only an analgesic in patients who were intubated and ventilated but with a level of consciousness that allowed us to view the effect of carotid clamping on motor functions.", 
    "1": "Forty-eight patients, ASA II-III, underwent surgical carotid endarterectomy. The anesthetic protocol began with preoxygenation for 2 min; induction with remifentanil 0.75-1 microgram kg-1 for 2 min., followed by perfusion of 1 microgram/kg-1.min-1 of remifentanil and propofol 1 microgram/kg-1; and orotracheal intubation by local anesthesia of the glottis with 5% lidocaine spray. Ventilation was with FiO2 100%, FR 12 min. and VT 8 ml. kg-1. For maintenance the dose of remifentanil was regulated to obtain a coordinated motor response (maximum 1.5 microgram/kg-1.min-1, minimum 0.35 microgram/kg-1. min-1). For all patients we monitored hemodynamics continuously and non-invasively, including aortic output by the transesophageal Doppler echocardiography.", 
    "2": "The objective of anesthesia was reached in all the patients. The most common hemodynamic alterations were bradycardia (28), arterial hypotension (25), elevated blood pressure (3) and altered aortic output. All changes were corrected quickly with the treatment used, guided by the evolution of hemodynamic parameters. Postanesthetic recovery came in less than 4 min. The only episodes of hyper -and hypotension consisted of a few episodes of mild hyper- (12) and hypotension (1), which were soon corrected. No alterations attributable to hemodynamic instability occurred. During surgery, an intracarotid shunt was necessary in only one patient. Three suffered surgically-related neurological complications after the operations. No complications could be attributed to anesthesia.", 
    "3": "An advantage of this technique is that the duration of anesthesia is not limited, with adequate ventilation and maintenance of an adequate state of consciousness for clinical evaluation of the repercussions of carotid clamping. Hemodynamic monitoring detected the appearance of imbalances requiring therapeutic intervention. The procedure is interesting provided it is performed according to a strict protocol, with continuous clinical and instrumental monitoring of the patient's status.", 
    "4": "Compared to major depression without psychosis, psychotic depression often responds poorly to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants alone. Atypical antipsychotics, which appear to possess thymoleptic properties, may represent a new treatment alternative for patients with psychotic mood disorders. This open-label, pilot study evaluated the efficacy of olanzapine monotherapy in patients with psychotic depression. Seven inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode (unipolar) with psychotic features participated in a 10-week open-label trial of olanzapine 10-20 mg/day. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were performed at each visit to evaluate clinical response. Four out of the 5 study completers responded during the trial. Overall, there was a statistically significant change between baseline and final visit on the SAPS, HRSD, and the CGI Scale (p < .001). The results of this pilot study suggest that olanzapine may be an effective treatment for some patients with unipolar psychotic depression. However, these observations require replication in randomized, controlled trials.",

These results were compared with retrospective comparison data obtained for an 18-month period from stored documented prehospital care reports (PCRs), a period when diazepam was used for facilitated intubation.", 
    "7": "During the study period, 343 (84%) of 409 attempted intubations were successful. Of these, 24 facilitated intubations (using etomidate) were attempted (all on breathing, agitated patients), and 19 (79%, CI 63%-95%) were successful. Eighteen of these (95%) were intubated successfully on the first attempt. The median age of the patients requiring intubation was 70 years (range 14-90), and 60% were female. There were no reported incidences of vomiting, broken teeth, or bleeding. The region's prior 18-month experience using diazepam for facilitated intubation resulted in ten (23%, CI 1%-36%) successful intubations of 43 facilitated intubation attempts.",

In light of the evidence that sudden cardiovascular-related death is associated with neuroleptic medication, we are especially interested in examining whether measurements of the power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) are differentially affected by various antipsychotic medications. We will also examine the cases in which PAS provides information regarding the relative safety of the various groups of drugs under investigation, in terms of their influence on the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance.",

    "12": "Our results show that schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine had significantly higher HR, lower HRV, lower high frequency (HF) and higher low frequency (LF) components compared to the patients treated with haloperidol, olanzapine, and the matched control subjects. Prolonged QTc intervals were more common in patients receiving treatment than in the control group, although the PR and QRS intervals did not differ significantly.",

Moreover, the influence of clonazepam (0.3 mg/kg, single dose, or repeated doses for 8 days) and carbamazepine (50 mg/kg, single dose, or repeated doses for 8 days) on the development of tolerance to ethanol was also examined. To study the influence of clonazepam and carbamazepine on preference to ethanol, both drugs were administered for 5 days during the last week of the experiment, (clonazepam at 0.1 mg/kg, b.i.d., i.p. and carbamazepine at 12.5 mg/kg, b.i.d, i.p.). Clonazepam and carbamazepine administered at single doses as well as multiple doses diminished the symptoms of withdrawal syndrome. Clonazepam did not prevent the development of tolerance to sleep-inducing and hypothermal action of ethanol, while carbamazepine prevented the development of tolerance to hypnotic effect of ethanol. Carbamazepine clearly reduced preference to ethanol (significantly vs. the control group and vs. the baseline values). Clonazepam also diminished preference to alcohol, but only in comparison with baseline values.", 
    "15": "GYKI 52466 [1,4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine], a non-competitive AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, administered i.p. at the dose of 5 mg/kg, exerted a significant anticonvulsant effect, as it decreased seizure and afterdischarge durations, being ineffective at 2 mg/kg. Subsequently, GYKI 52466 (2 mg/kg) was combined with antiepileptic drugs at doses ineffective in fully kindled rats. Co-administration of GYKI 52466 with clonazepam (0.003 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in a significant reduction of seizure severity (by 20%), seizure duration (by 31%) and afterdischarge duration (by 24%). Co-injection of GYKI 52466 with valproate (75 mg/kg i.p.) also resulted in the respective 8%, 16%, and 17% reductions of the three studied seizure parameters. No protection was observed when GYKI 52466 was co-administered with carbamazepine (20 mg/kg i.p.), phenobarbital (20 mg/kg i.p.), or diphenylhydantoin (40 mg/kg i.p.). Combinations of GYKI 524662 with antiepileptic drugs did not cause any significant motor (rotarod test) or long-term memory deficits (passive avoidance task). Only GYKI 52466 administered alone at 5 mg/kg, caused a significant impairment of retention in amygdala-kindled rats. The interaction at a pharmacokinetic level, at least in case of the combination of GYKI 52466 with valproate, can be excluded because GYKI 52466 did not interfere with the free plasma level of valproate. These results give further support to the idea of a potential clinical benefits of the combined treatment of AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists with some antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "16": "1. A histidine residue in the N-terminal extracellular region of alpha 1,2,3,5 subunits of the human GABA(A) receptor, which is replaced by an arginine in alpha 4 and alpha 6 subunits, is a major determinant for high affinity binding of classical benzodiazepine (BZ)-site ligands. The effect of mutating this histidine at position 105 in the alpha 5 subunit to an arginine (alpha 5H105R) on BZ-site pharmacology has been investigated using radioligand binding on HEK293 and L(tk-) cells and two electrode voltage clamp recording on Xenopus oocytes in which GABA(A) receptors of subtypes alpha 5, alpha 5H105R, alpha 4 and alpha 6 were co-expressed with beta 3 gamma 2s. 2. The classical BZs, diazepam and flunitrazepam (full agonists on the alpha 5 receptor) showed negligible affinity and therefore negligible efficacy on alpha 5H105R receptors. The beta-carbolines DMCM and beta CCE (inverse agonists on the alpha 5 receptor) retained some affinity but did not exhibit inverse agonist efficacy at alpha 5H105R receptors. Therefore, the alpha 5H105R mutation confers an alpha 4/alpha 6-like pharmacology to the classical BZs and beta-carbolines. 3. Ro15-4513, flumazenil, bretazenil and FG8094, which share a common imidazobenzodiazepine core structure, retained high affinity and were higher efficacy agonists on alpha 5H105R receptors than would be predicted from an alpha 4/alpha 6 pharmacological profile. This effect was antagonized by DMCM, which competes for the BZ-site and therefore is likely to be mediated via the BZ-site. 4. These data indicate that the conserved histidine residue in the alpha subunit is not only a key determinant in the affinity of BZ-site ligands on alpha 5 containing GABA(A) receptors, but also influences ligand efficacy.", 
    "17": "1. The electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of the propsychotic agent phencyclidine (PCP), were studied in conscious rats using power spectra (0 - 30 Hz), from the prefrontal cortex or sensorimotor cortex. PCP (0.1 - 3 mg kg(-1) s.c.) caused a marked dose-dependent increase in EEG power in the frontal cortex at 1 - 3 Hz with decreases in power at higher frequencies (9 - 30 Hz). At high doses (3 mg kg(-1) s.c.) the entire spectrum shifted to more positive values, indicating an increase in cortical synchronization. MK 801 (0.05 - 0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) caused similar effects but with lesser changes in power. 2. In contrast, the non-competitive AMPA antagonists GYKI 52466 and GYKI 53655 increased EEG power over the whole power spectrum (1 - 10 mg kg(-1) i.p.). The atypical antipsychotic clozapine (0.2 mg kg(-1) s.c.) synchronized the EEG (peak 8 Hz). The 5-HT(2A)-antagonist, M100907, specifically increased EEG power at 2 - 3 Hz at low doses (10 and 50 microg kg(-1) s.c.), whereas at higher doses (0.1 mg kg(-1) s.c.) the profile resembled that of clozapine. 3. Clozapine (0.2 mg kg(-1) s.c. ), GYKI 53655 (5 mg kg(-1) i.p.), prazosin (0.05 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.), and M100907 (0.01 and 0.05 mg kg(-1) s.c.) antagonized the decrease in power between 5 and 30 Hz caused by PCP (1 mg kg(-1) s.c.), but not the increase in power at 1 - 3 Hz in prefrontal cortex.", 
    "18": "Cultured rat precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) were used to study the influence of hypothermic preservation and reoxygenation at 37 degrees C on cellular metabolism and drug biotransformation. Cold hypoxic storage caused a depressed metabolism in rat liver slices, but reoxygenation for 8 h at 37 degrees C partially restored the levels of both ATP and GSH and totally restored the capacity to synthesize proteins. Metabolism of midazolam (CYP3A-dependent oxidation) by cold preserved liver slices was decreased by 30% but no further affected by reoxygenation, showing the same profile as freshly cut slices. Such a reoxygenation at 37 degrees C is accompanied by a dramatic loss of CYP3A2 protein while CYP3A1 protein was unaffected. These results suggest that CYP3A2 did not play a major role in midazolam oxidation. Such results are not consistent with a putative reoxygenation injury but rather with cold hypoxic damage. Since cold preserved liver slices did not respond to bacterial endotoxin stimulation (lipopolysaccharides), a minor role of non-parenchymal cells is suggested as mediators for deleterious effects developed during the cold storage.", 
    "19": "The aim of this study was to evaluate pancreatic juice secretion of calves in the first postnatal days, and determine a potential involvement of cholecystokinin (CCK) and intestinal CCK receptor in its regulation. Nine neonatal Friesian calves (five controls and four treated intraduodenally with FK480, a CCK-A receptor antagonist) were surgically fitted with a pancreatic duct catheter and a duodenal cannula before the first colostrum feeding. Collections of pancreatic juice and duodenal luminal pressure recordings were started early after recovery from anaesthesia and continued for 6 days. From day 2 or 3 of life, periodic fluctuations in pancreatic secretions were observed in concert with duodenal myoelectric motor complex (MMC) and variations in plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) concentrations. Intraduodenal administration of FK480 reduced pancreatic juice secretion while intravenous infusion of CCK had no effect. Immunocytochemistry indicated an association of mucosal CCK-A and -B receptors with neural components of the small intestine. In conclusion, periodic activity of the exocrine pancreas exists in neonatal calves soon after birth and local neural intestinal CCK-A receptors could be partly responsible for the modulation of neonatal calf pancreatic secretion.", 
    "20": "Substances capable of changing the functions of the central nervous system are widely distributed in plant kingdom, and many of them were discovered by ancient food-gatherers at the dawn of humanity. In the Old World only a few substances producing euphoria or altered states of consciousness and having habit-forming properties are still widely used. They are the products of poppy (opium, morphine), hemp (hashish, marijuana), and of fermentation of various organic materials alkohol. This list has recently been joined by the psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The addiction-forming compounds originated in the New World and widely spread are tobacco (nicotine) and cocaine. In the 19th and 20th, century the development of medicinal chemistry resulted in several synthetic compounds, originally proposed as therapeutics, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and amphetamines. Due to legal problems, to avoid production of the substances already prohibited, many designer drugs were manufactured. In addition, several compounds were synthesized as recreational drugs. Also some compounds that were not regarded as drugs, such as aromatic hydrocarbons and other cleansing agents, as well as steroids were found to have properties of dangerous, habit-forming agents. The attitude of society and the pattern of use of psychoactive substances have changed with time, particularly in the last decades. The active principles are now more addictive because of concentration, purification, chemical modifications and the way of ingestion, which now favors most rapid transport to the central nervous system. The substance abuse approaches the level of global epidemics, and the recent usage of drugs of addition is also reviewed.", 
    "21": "Prolonged seizures may alter the brain function in numerous ways. It is conceivable that they might lead to modifications of seizure susceptibility or anticonvulsive drug efficacy, however, only limited data address this issue. Therefore, we have decided to estimate the antiepileptic activity of drugs interfering with GABA-ergic neurotransmission in mice subjected to prolonged clonic seizures 2 weeks before, using pentetrazol test. The activity of valproate, but not diazepam or phenobarbital, was diminished in animals following repetitive clonic seizures. It might be hypothesized that in humans suffering from epilepsy, prolonged seizures in the past might contribute to the lowered efficacy of valproic acid later on.",

Although the majority of cases are controlled with first- or second-line therapy, others develop pervasive seizures, requiring multiple anticonvulsants. To provide data on the incidence of seizures and response to anticonvulsant therapies, a cohort of 90 term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated at our institution between January 1, 1995, and July 1, 1999, was reviewed. Of the 60 infants who developed seizures, 59 received phenobarbital initially; in 29 cases, the seizures resolved. The remaining 30 infants received phenytoin as a second-line anticonvulsant, and seizures stopped in 10 cases. The 20 infants with ongoing pervasive seizures were treated with intravenous paraldehyde.",

Patients with bipolar disorder (n = 344), manic or mixed episode, who were inadequately responsive to more than 2 weeks of lithium or valproate therapy, were randomized to receive cotherapy (olanzapine + mood-stabilizer) or monotherapy (placebo + mood-stabilizer).", 
    "25": "Olanzapine cotherapy improved patients' YMRS total scores significantly more than monotherapy (-13.11 vs -9.10; P = .003). Clinical response rates (> or = 50% improvement on YMRS) were significantly higher with cotherapy (67.7% vs 44.7%; P< .001). Olanzapine cotherapy improved 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) total scores significantly more than monotherapy (4.98 vs 0.89 points; P< .001). In patients with mixed-episodes with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (DSM-IV mixed episode; HAMD-21 score of > or = 20 at baseline), olanzapine cotherapy improved HAMD-21 scores by 10.31 points compared with 1.57 for monotherapy (P< .001). Extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale) were not significantly changed from baseline to end point in either treatment group.

The average latency from insult to dystonia was 4.1 years in this series and 2.8 years in the literature, with the longest latencies occurring after perinatal injury. Basal ganglia lesions were identified in 48% of cases in this series and 60% of the cases in the literature, most commonly involving the putamen. Patients experienced benefit from medical therapy in only 26% of medication trials in this series and in only 35% of trials in the literature. In the patients reported here, the benzodiazepines clonazepam and diazepam were the most effective medications with 50% of trials resulting in at least some benefit. In the literature, anticholinergic drugs were most effective with 41% of trials resulting in benefit. Surgery was successful in five of six cases in this series and in 22 of 23 cases in the literature. However, in 12 cases, results were transient.",

Hemidystonia responds poorly to most medical therapies, but some patients may benefit from treatment with benzodiazepines or anticholinergic drugs. Surgical therapy may be successful but benefit is often transient.", 
    "31": "Evidence from toxicological studies suggested that an ionotropic GABA receptor of novel pharmacology (picrotoxin-insensitive, bicuculline-sensitive) exists in the chick embryo retina. In this report, we provide direct morphological and electrophysiological evidence for the existence of such an iGABA receptor. Chick embryo retinas (14-16 days old) incubated in the presence of kainic acid showed pronounced histopathology in all retinal layers. Maximal protection from this toxicity required a combination of bicuculline and picrotoxin. Individual application of the antagonists indicated that a picrotoxin-insensitive, bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptor is likely to be present on ganglion and amacrine, but not bipolar, cells. GABA currents in embryonic and mature chicken retinal neurons were measured by whole cell patch clamp. GABA was puffed at the dendritic processes in the IPL. Picrotoxin (500 microM, in the bath) eliminated all (>95%) the GABA current in the majority of ganglion and amacrine cells tested, but many cells possessed a substantial picrotoxin-insensitive component. This current was eliminated by bicuculline (200 microM). This current was not a transporter-associated current, since it was not altered by GABA transport blockers or sodium removal. The current-voltage relation was linear and reversed near E(Cl), as expected for a ligand-gated chloride current. Both pentobarbital and lorazepam enhanced the picrotoxin-insensitive current. We conclude that chicken retinal ganglion and amacrine cells express a GABA receptor that is GABA-A-like, in that it can be blocked by bicuculline, and positively modulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines, but is insensitive to the noncompetitive blocker picrotoxin. Understanding the molecular properties of this receptor will be important for understanding both physiological GABA neurotransmission and the pathology of GABA receptor overactivation.",

    "38": "Gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) and benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors and dopamine uptake sites in 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rat brains were studied by receptor autoradiography using [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]mazindol binding, respectively. The rats were unilaterally lesioned in the medial forebrain bundle and the brains were analyzed at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-lesion. Degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment caused a significant loss of dopamine uptake sites in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra (SN) in the lesioned animals. In the contralateral side, however, dopamine uptake sites showed no significant changes in the brain throughout the experiments. On the other hand, no significant changes in GABA(A) receptors were observed in the brain of both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides during post-lesion. In contrast, BZ receptors were observed significantly increased in the ventromedial part of striatum of the ipsilateral side from 2 to 4 weeks post-lesion. Furthermore, a transient increase in BZ receptors was found in the ipsilateral SN only at 2 weeks post-lesion. In contralateral side, most regions examined showed no significant changes in BZ receptors throughout the experiments except for a transient increase in the SN at 1 week post-lesion. These results demonstrate that 6-hydroxydopamine can cause severe functional damage in dopamine uptake sites in the nigrostriatal pathway. Our results also suggest that the change in BZ receptors is more pronounced than that in GABA(A) receptors in the brain after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the increase in BZ receptors in the brain of 6-hydroxydopamine-treated model may be due to the additional disruption of the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Thus, investigations into possible changes in neurotransmitter receptors other than dopaminergic receptors appear to be important for the elucidation of pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease.",

Although typical antipsychotics are effective, they have undesirable side effects such as induction of depressive symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotics have more favorable side effect profiles, and recent evidence shows their efficacy in treating mania. Apart from a previous small study that compared risperidone with typical neuroleptics as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers, no studies to date have directly compared atypical antipsychotics with typical antipsychotics as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers in a clinically relevant, naturalistic setting.",

    "47": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in CNS can elevate level of neuronal excitability by the mechanisms of hyperpolarization. Gabaergic hypothesis of epileptogenesis influenced development of a group of gabamimetic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Powerful conventional AEDs barbiturates and benzodiazepines can directly activate GABA-A receptor but their usefulness is limited by development of dependence and tolerance to antiseizure activity. The second generation AEDs have been achieved by a rationale synthesis of compounds that could mimic or augment the activity of endogenous GABA. Vigabatrin (VGB) irreversibly inhibits GABA-T activity, tiagabine (TGB) inhibits GABA-reuptake system (GAT-1) and gabapentin (GPT) enhances GABA turnover in CNS. New drugs with selective and specific influence on GABA neurotransmission are non-toxic and well-tolerated, but some side-effects (aggravation of seizures, visual field deficit and psychotic reactions) seems to be strictly connected with their pharmacodynamic properties. Absence and probably myoclonic seizures noted in about 10% of patients under VGB seems to be the result of disturbed GABA inhibition in thalamic interneurons and non-controlled hyperactivity of excitatory neocortex-thalamus-neocotrex circuits. Perimetric examination might reveal peripheral, persistent binasal visual field deficit in about 30% of patients treated with VGB. This is probably the effect of cytotoxic influence of enormous accumulation of GABA in retinal neurons. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines can exacerbate intellectual functioning and behaviour. Some emotional and reactive disturbances are more characteristic for newer drugs. Serious depressive reactions and psychoses were observed respectively in 12.5 and 2.5% epileptics under VGB and anecdotically after TGB or GPT therapy. Newer selective and specific gabamimetic AEDs play an essential role as add-on therapy of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, but they did not bring significant qualitive change in the possibilities of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "48": "There are lots of conditions producing memory impairment. It must be taken into account, not only degenerative diseases like Alzheimer Disease; but also epilepsy, depression, stress, recreational drug abuse, thyroid diseases, etc. In this article we'll comment on one of the more common and current ways of having memory disorders such as some medications currently in use, especially by old people. As physicians, we usually \"forget\" that many prescription medicines or over the counter remedies could have the potential hazard of producing severe memory impairment or delirium. In our country, benzodiazepines, are one of the most prescribed drugs used to deal with anxiety disorders, and are usually taken chronically almost without professional surveillance producing memory disorders as well as depression, addiction, etc. Other medications, like antidepressants, anticonvulsants, sedatives, cardiological drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be also discussed.", 
    "49": "The following two different modulatory procedures to control intractable epileptic seizures are presented: (1) chronic electrical stimulation of the centromedian-thalamic nucleus (ESCM) for control of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and atypical absences, and (2) subacute hippocampal stimulation (SAHCS) and chronic hippocampal stimulation for control of nonlesional temporal lobe seizures. The ESCM antiepileptic effect seems to be the result of activation of a nonspecific reticulothalamocortical system responsible for generalized electrocortical responses (recruiting, desynchronization, negative direct current shifts, and three spike-wave complexes per second). The success of the ESCM procedure depends on the following predictor factors: case selection (primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures and atypical absences of the Lennox Gastaut syndrome), ventriculographic and electrophysiologic definition of the optimal stereotactic targets (based on the anterior commissure, posterior commissure, and the vertical line perpendicular to the posterior commissure and electrocortical recruiting responses), periodic electrophysiologic monitoring of the reliability of ESCM in the absence of the patient's subjective sensations and with totally internalized subcutaneous stimulation systems (by recording scalp electrocortical recruiting, desynchronizing, and direct current responses), quantitative evaluation of clinical and EEG improvement, and analysis of the ON and OFF effects, taking into account a long-lasting (possibly plastic) effect of ESCM. SAHCS blocks clinical and EEG signs of temporal lobe epileptogenesis with no additional damage of the stimulated hippocampal tissue. Preliminary results suggest that this antiepileptic effect is, at least in part, the result of a physiologic inhibition of the stimulated hippocampal tissue, because after SAHCS the authors found the following: (1) increased threshold and decreased duration, propagation, and blockage of the clinical signs accompanied with the hippocampal afterdischarge; (2) flattening of the hippocampal-evoked response recovery cycles; (3) single photon emission computed tomographic hypoperfusion; and (4) increased concentration of benzodiazepine receptor binding at the stimulated hippocampal region. Chronic hippocampal stimulation persistently blocked temporal lobe epileptogenesis in one patient under open protocols during 24 months with no apparent additional alterations in recent memory.", 
    "50": "Patients who have sustained a neurological injury and then improved may experience transient reemergence of their syndromes when given benzodiazepines. As a step toward assessing whether neurotransmitter systems underlie poststroke clinical improvement, we selected midazolam, a gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) agonist, for systemic administration to measure general or stroke-specific effects in patients.", 
    "51": "Eight patients with image-verified stroke (5 with left-sided and 3 with right-sided cerebral lesions) participated. The strokes had occurred from 7 days to 6 years earlier, with patients showing clinical improvement from their initial syndromes. Each patient underwent baseline testing for motor function, aphasia, and left hemispatial neglect, after which intravenous midazolam was delivered until mild drowsiness was detected. Patients were tested during this period and again after 2 hours when sedation had dissipated.", 
    "52": "After the administration of midazolam, the 5 patients with left hemisphere stroke demonstrated reemergence or worsening of their initial right hemiparesis and aphasia but showed no left neglect. The 3 patients with right cerebral stroke showed reemergence of left hemiparesis and left visual field neglect but no aphasia. All patients returned to baseline after 2 hours.", 
    "53": "Under conditions of light sedation, patients whose initial stroke syndrome had substantially improved clinically showed transient reemergence of their initial focal syndrome. These data suggest a possible role for GABA(A)-mediated neurochemical mechanisms in poststroke improvement and sensitivity to medication effects.", 
    "54": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide better solutions than linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to problems of classification and estimation involving a large number of non-homogeneous (categorical and metric) variables. In this study, we compared the ability of traditional LDA and a feed-forward back-propagation (FF-BP) ANN with self-momentum to predict pharmacological treatments received by intravenous drug users (IDUs) hospitalised for coexisting medical illness. When medical staff considered detoxification appropriate they usually suggested methadone (MET) and (or) benzodiazepines (BDZ). Given four different treatment options (MET, BDZ, MET+BDZ, no treatment) as dependent variables and 38 independent variables, the FF-BP ANN provided the best prediction of the consultant's decision (overall accuracy: 62.7%). It achieved the highest level of predictive accuracy for the BDZ option (90.5%), the lowest for no treatment (29.6), often misclassifying no treatment as BDZ. The LDA yielded a lower mean accuracy (50.3%). When the untreated group was excluded, ANN improved its absolute recognition rate by only 1.2% and the BDZ group remained the best predicted. In contrast, LDA improved its absolute recognition rate from 50.3 to 58.9%, maximum 65.7% for the BDZ group. In conclusion, the FF-BP ANN was more accurate than the statistical model (discriminant analysis) in predicting the pharmacological treatment of IDUs.", 
    "55": "Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is frequently used along with benzodiazepine anxiolytics in clinics. In this study, the effects of fluvoxamine on the anxiolytic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines were examined in the light/dark box, rota-rod and passive avoidance tests using mice. Diazepam, ethyl loflazepate and its active metabolite, CM7116, were used as benzodiazepine anxiolytics. The anxiolytic effects of diazepam, ethyl loflazepate and CM7116 were potentiated by intraperitoneal treatment with fluvoxamine at 10 mg/kg, whereas only those of ethyl loflazepate were potentiated by fluvoxamine at 45 mg/kg. The motor incoordination and amnesia induced by ethyl loflazepate and CM7116 were not affected by fluvoxamine, although these adverse effects of diazepam were potentiated by fluvoxamine at 45 mg/kg. Fluvoxamine itself showed no effects in any of the tests. These results suggest that low-dose fluvoxamine potentiates the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, while high-dose fluvoxamine augments the adverse effects depending on the benzodiazepine used. Consequently, when fluvoxamine is administered along with benzodiazepines, the doses of both fluvoxamine and benzodiazepines should be carefully chosen to achieve anxiolytic effects without any adverse results.", 
    "56": "Midazolam HCl (Versed) is often used for intravenous conscious sedation in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and is increasingly used in endoscopic sphincter of Oddi (SO) manometry. The effect of medications on SO motility should be fully characterized if they are to be used during SO manometry. There has been controversy as to whether midazolam influences SO motility. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of midazolam on the normal SO.", 
    "57": "The study population consisted of 60 patients presenting with recurrent abdominal pain who were found to have SO basal pressure of less than 40 mmHg on SO manometry. ERCP was performed in the standard fashion using a pneumohydraulic capillary perfused triple-lumen catheter system in a stationary pull-through method from the pancreatic and common bile ducts. In the test group 30 patients received 2 mg midazolam intravenously while the 30 patients in the control group received intravenous saline. SO manometry was performed, with recording of the basal pressure, phasic pressure, phasic amplitude, phasic frequency and ductal pressure before and 3 min after the intravenous infusion. The changes in basal, phasic and duct pressure as well as phasic frequency before and after the administration of saline and midazolam were compared.", 
    "58": "Midazolam causes a small but statistically significant reduction in basal and peak SO pressure (4 and 19 mmHg respectively), compared with saline. Diagnostic concordance (normal vs. abnormal) between the basal sphincter pressure before and after midazolam was seen in 100 % of patients. Midazolam does not significantly affect phasic amplitude, phasic frequency or duct pressure.",

    "60": "The vigorous debate over whom to sedate, when to sedate, and how to sedate shows no sign of running out of steam. There is a general consensus that patients should be more involved in the decision-making process for the sedation \"menu\". A move away from the take-it-or-leave-it attitude of all or nothing to an \"\u00e0 la carte\" choice is to be encouraged. A new textbook and several further guidelines have appeared. The particular problems associated with sedating the elderly are briefly presented. The pros and cons of using local pharyngeal anaesthesia are discussed. Enthusiasm for the use of intravenous propofol is gathering momentum, despite continuing worries about its safety in the hands of the nonanaesthetist. For many endoscopists, the combination of a benzodiazepine plus (or minus) an opioid with which they are most familiar is still the best compromise in terms of efficacy, cost, and safety. Fatal drug-induced cardiopulmonary complications continue to occur, despite a general trend toward using smaller doses of sedation than we did 5 - 10 years ago. Monitoring techniques that are at present considered as research tools may one day become commonplace. These include: the use of an electroencephalography parameter known as bispectral analysis; transcutaneous CO(2) measurement; and a modified continuous capnographic waveform trace to monitor ventilatory effort. Bispectral analysis may be of use in monitoring central nervous system depression and helping to distinguish between conscious sedation and deep sedation. If the measurement of CO(2) levels, either transcutaneously or in breath samples, was as easy and inexpensive as measuring SpO(2) with a pulse oximeter, then undoubtedly such technology would enhance the early detection of sedative-induced hypoventilation and apnoea. Further evidence regarding droperidol's possible role in conscious sedation is presented. Pain during colonoscopy remains a problem, and the possible role for intraluminal injection of peppermint oil, as well as the value of variable-stiffness colonoscopes, in reducing the need for intravenous sedation is discussed. Case reports of hyponatraemic encephalopathy and hypocalcaemic tetany as complications of oral bowel preparation are presented, as is the challenge associated with adequate bowel preparation in diabetic patients.",

Thirty patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as well as criteria for substance abuse or substance dependence, were treated in a 12-month prospective, open-label trial of olanzapine. Patients were evaluated with multiple efficacy and safety measures at baseline and then monthly thereafter. Statistically significant improvement was noted in psychopathology, levels of hope, and safety measures. Seventy percent (n = 21) of the patients achieved early full substance abuse remission at the end of the study period, while 30% (n = 9) achieved early partial substance abuse remission. Our results indicate that olanzapine treatment improved psychopathology, increased hopefulness, and reduced antipsychotic-associated side effects. The benefits observed with olanzapine treatment may contribute to the patients' substance abuse remission.",

The drug mixtures prepared included combinations of two, three, four and five of the following drugs: morphine hydrochloride, 60 mg/day; midazolam hydrochloride, 15 mg/day; haloperidol lactate, 7.5 mg/day; hyoscine-N-butyl-bromide, 60 mg/day; dexamethasone sodium phosphate, 16 mg/day; metoclopramide hydrochloride, 40 mg/day, and tramadol, 400 mg/day. Out of 86 mixtures evaluated in vitro, 52 were found to be physically compatible. Precipitation was always obtained when dexamethasone sodium phosphate at the concentrations assayed was combined with haloperidol lactate and/or midazolam hydrochloride. However, no precipitation occurred when morphine hydrochloride, the opioid most frequently used in patients of this type, and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were combined. Of the drug mixtures that were physically compatible, 18 were administered to the patient population evaluated. Very good symptom control was obtained with all of them, and especially with the mixture of morphine + midazolam + haloperidol + hyoscine, which is the one most frequently administered to cancer patients for palliative care in the final stages of life in our Unit.", 
    "64": "Recently, we reported structurally novel PDE4 inhibitors based on 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives. The main interest in developing bezodiazepine-based PDE4 inhibitors is in their lack of adverse effects of emesis with respect to rolipram-like compounds. A large effort has thus been made toward the structural optimization of this series. In the absence of structural information on the inhibitor binding mode into the PDE4 active site, 2D-QSAR (H-QSAR) and two 3D-QSAR (CoMFA and CoMSIA) methods were applied to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling the PDE4 affinity of the benzodiazepine derivatives. As expected, the CoMSIA 3D contour maps have provided more information on the benzodiazepine interaction mode with the PDE4 active site whereas CoMFA has built the best tool for activity prediction. The 2D pharmacophoric model derived from CoMSIA fields is consistent with the crystal structure of the PDE4 active site reported recently. The combination of the 2D and 3D-QSAR models was used not only to predict new compounds from the structural optimization process, but also to screen a large library of bezodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "65": "About 10% of patients with severe acute psychiatric illness exhibit a cluster of motor signs (mutism, negativism, rigidity, posturing, stereotypy, staring, etc.) that are identified as the syndrome of catatonia. Catatonia responds to sedative anticonvulsant treatment (barbiturates, benzodiazepines) and to electroconvulsive therapy. These treatments raise seizure thresholds. The commonality in response indicates that catatonia, malignant catatonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, toxic serotonin syndrome, delirious mania, catatonic excitement, benign stupor, and oneirophrenia are best evaluated as diverse manifestations of one syndrome for clinical and neuroscience research purposes.", 
    "66": "Over the past two decades, catatonia, particularly its acutely emerging akinetic-hypokinetic (stuporous) variant, has gradually regained its importance in descriptive psychopathology. Electroconvulsive therapy and lately benzodiazepines are not only effective treatment options in this form of catatonia, but also helped generate neurobiological hypotheses concerning its pathophysiology. Within this broad framework, this paper summarizes the results of recent benzodiazepine treatment response studies in catatonic movement disorders with particular reference to the authors' own studies in Chinese patients with catatonia.",

    "68": "Whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from cultured rat dorsal root ganglionic neurons. GABA (3 mumol/L) was applied by pressure ejection. The anesthetics were dissolved in the external solution and given by the \"Y-tube\" method.", 
    "69": "Co-application of propofol (0.3-3 mumol/L) and diazepam (100 nmol/L) potentiated the IGABA which was significantly larger than the sum of that potentiated by drug alone. Diazepam (100 nmol/L) shifted the concentration-response curve for the IGABA potentiation induced by propofol to the left in a parallel fashion. The EC50 value for propofol was decreased by diazepam from 7.6 +/- 1.8 mumol/L to 3.9 +/- 1.1 mumol/L (n = 9).", 
    "70": "Our results suggest that propofol combined with diazepam synergistically potentiates the IGABA. Diazepam-induced increase in the apparent binding affinity of propofol for the GABAA receptors is likely responsible for a clinical synergistic hypnotic action during co-application with propofol and diazepam.", 
    "71": "Atypical antipsychotics are widely used in psychotic disorders, refractory to conventional neuroleptic agents. They induce minimal extra pyramidal side effects, probably due to their greater affinity for certain dopaminergic receptors. However, this polyreceptor affinity may be responsible for the development of other side effects. We report a 48 years old male drinker and addicted to cocaine, that after two months of Olanzapine use, developed a severe diabetes mellitus with fasting blood glucose values reaching 514 mg/dl. When he was admitted to the hospital, physical examination was normal and his body mass index was 28 kg/m2. Olanzapine was discontinued and blood glucose values gradually returned to normal. After two months of follow up, the patient is on dietary treatment and with a fasting glucose of 132 mg/dl.",

The parental S. typhimurium YG7108, derived from TA1535, lacks two O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase genes, ada and ogt, and is highly sensitive to the mutagenicity of alkylating agents. The expression levels of CYP holo-protein in the genetically engineered S. typhimurium YG7108 cells, determined by carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectra, ranged from 62 nmol/L culture for CYP2C19 to 169 nmol/L culture for CYP3A4. The expression level of the OR varied, depending on the form of CYP coexpressed, and ranged from 214 to 1029 units/L culture. Each form of CYP expressed in the S. typhimurium YG7108 cells catalyzed the oxidation of a representative substrate at an efficient rate. The rates appeared comparable to the reported activities of CYP expressed in human liver microsomes or CYP in other heterologous systems, indicating that the OR was sufficiently expressed to support the catalytic activity of CYP. These S. typhimurium strains may be useful not only for predicting the metabolic activation of promutagens catalyzed by human CYP but also for identifying the CYP form involved.",

A vast number of potentially neurotoxic compounds exist, including prescription drugs, illicit substances, and exposures through the workplace, residence, hobbies, and the environment. Effects of neurotoxins can mimic neurologic illnesses; therefore, it is important to consider neurotoxins in the differential diagnosis of any patient with neurological dysfunction. Paramount to the diagnosis of a possible neurotoxic syndrome is establishing causation.

The therapeutic value of a given drug must be weighed against theoretical adverse effects on the fetus before and after birth. The available literature suggests that it is safe to take diazepam during pregnancy but not during lactation because it can cause lethargy, sedation, and weight loss in infants. The use of chlordiazepoxide during pregnancy and lactation seems to be safe. Avoidance of alprazolam during pregnancy and lactation would be prudent. To avoid the potential risk of congenital defects, physicians should use the benzodiazepines that have long safety records and should prescribe a benzodiazepine as monotherapy at the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. High peak concentrations should be avoided by dividing the daily dosage into two or three doses.",

    "86": "Midazolam is widely used as a preanesthetic medication for children. Prior studies have used extemporaneous formulations to disguise the bitter taste of IV midazolam and to improve patient acceptance, but with unknown bioavailability. In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study we examined the efficacy, safety, and taste acceptability of three doses (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 20 mg) of commercially prepared Versed((R)) syrup (midazolam HCl) in children stratified by age (6 mo to <2 yr, 2 to <6 yr, and 6 to <16 yr). All children were ASA class I-III scheduled for elective surgery. Subjects were continuously observed and monitored with pulse oximetry. Ninety-five percent of patients accepted the syrup, and 97% demonstrated satisfactory sedation before induction. There was an apparent relationship between dose and onset of sedation and anxiolysis (P < 0.01). Eight-eight percent had satisfactory anxiety ratings at the time of attempted separation from parents, and 86% had satisfactory anxiety ratings at face mask application. The youngest age group recovered earlier than the two older age groups (P < 0.001). There was no relationship between midazolam dose and duration of postanesthesia care unit stay. Before induction, there were no episodes of desaturation, but there were two episodes of nausea and three episodes of emesis. At the time of induction, during anesthesia, and in the postanesthesia care unit, there were several adverse respiratory events. Oral midazolam syrup is effective for producing sedation and anxiolysis at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, with minimal effects on respiration and oxygen saturation even when administered at doses as large as 1.0 mg/kg (maximum, 20 mg) as the sole sedating medication to healthy children in a supervised clinical setting.",

Fifty ASA I and II patients 10-18 yr of age were enrolled in a prospective double-blinded study. Patients were randomized to receive either 20 mg of midazolam (M group) or midazolam vehicle (P group) as premedication. Before the induction, sedation scores and BIS values were determined in all patients. After inhaled induction and intubation, expired sevoflurane was stabilized at 3% in 60% N(2)O and the corresponding BIS (BIS I) recorded. Upon completion of surgery, sevoflurane was stabilized at 0.5% and the BIS (BIS E) again recorded. Plasma midazolam levels were measured at the time of BIS I and BIS E. There were no significant differences between groups in awakening time, sevoflurane/N(2)O awakening concentrations, time to postanesthesia care unit discharge, or BIS I and BIS E measurements. Sedation scores and preinduction BIS values were significantly lower in Group M than in Group P, although only 40% of midazolam-treated patients exhibited detectable sedation, with marked interindividual variability in achieved plasma midazolam levels. Detectable preoperative sedation was predictive of delayed emergence.",

The goal of ROD and UROD is to provide a rapid transition from opioid dependency to oral naltrexone therapy. The patient is given general anesthesia and high-dose opioid antagonists. This induces a severe withdrawal but spares the patient the experience. In theory, the process is complete within four to five hours. The patient awakens without opioid dependency and is started on oral naltrexone. Any subsequent, persistent withdrawal symptoms are treated symptomatically. A novel, unapproved approach is to compound a pellet of naltrexone and implant it in the subcutaneous tissue. In theory, this should result in continuous therapeutic levels for this drug, and avoid issues with noncompliance.", 
    "103": "This article reports six cases of complications from the same detoxification center that performed UROD with naltrexone pellet implantation, including pulmonary edema, prolonged withdrawal, drug toxicity, withdrawal from cross-addiction to alcohol and benzodiazepines, variceal rupture, aspiration pneumonia, and death.",

    "105": "We compared ketamine/propofol (KP) anesthesia with the commonly used high dose fentanyl (F) anesthesia in patients who underwent aortocoronary bypass surgery. The doses of anesthetic drugs and their time schedule of administering was standardized. The study period included the postoperative ICU stay. 31 patients were enrolled (15 in the KP- and 16 in the F-group). The measured and calculated hemodynamic data were intra- and postoperative not statistically different,except the mean and systolic arterial pressure (p = 0.049), which were in the KP-group from the first postoperative hour higher. After separation from bypass the F-patients were more dependent of adrenoreceptor agonists for hemodynamic stabilization than the KP-patients. The postoperative Holter ECG monitoring resulted in following issues: ventricular tachycardias, ventricular salvos and ventricular couplets were significantly less to observe in the KP-group. A difference existed also in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles, but without statistical significance. No patient fulfilled all criteria for a perioperative myocardial infarction, although in some patients one or two pathologic enzyme value or a pathologic change in the postoperative ECG could be proved. Ketamine resembles in the chemical structure cocaine, therefore it shares with cocaine some effects: inhibiting the neuronal uptake of catecholamines and acting as a sodium-channel blocker. Inhibiting the sodium current is one of the kinds how antiarrhythmic drugs work.",

The computerised data management of the main French health reimbursement system now allows surveillance of the use of this drug, and how it is prescribed. The purpose of this study is to determine the profile of maintained patients, prescribed doses, associated psychotropic treatments and how practitioners prescribe these treatments. This study analyses the 11186 buprenorphine prescriptions electronically transmitted for reimbursement between September and December 1999 in a specific French region. It was found that the 2078 treated patients consumed a mean of 11.5 mg of buprenorphine per day and 12% of them procured prescriptions from more than two prescribers. 43% of maintained patients had an associated benzodiazepine prescription, mainly flunitrazepam, often on the same prescription form. 61% of patients had regular follow-up, others had occasional consultations (21%) and another 18% had deviant maintenance treatment (more than two prescribers or more than 20 mg per day of daily buprenorphine dose). Benzodiazepine consumption was much higher in the 'deviant group' (71.4%). 85% of buprenorphine prescriptions were made by GPs. 21% of GPs prescribed buprenorphine and 61% of those had only one or two maintained patients. Buprenorphine prescription by French GPs is a procedure with no particular requirements, allowing many patients to easily access maintenance treatments. However, a high risk of abuse exists, which demands extensive investigation and evaluation of these practices.", 
    "108": "Tourette's disorder is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterised clinically by motor and vocal tics, which may be associated to conductual disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although the neurochemistry of Tourette's disorder is not well known, there are some effective therapies for tics, OCD and ADHD. However, these are not devoid of adverse effects. Tics only require treatment when they interfere with the functioning of the patient. If therapy is needed, monotherapy at the minimal effective dose is desirable, but some patients may require two or more drugs. The most frequently used drugs for tics are antipsychotics (mainly pimozide and haloperidol) and clonidine. The potential usefulness of atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, ziprasidone) and other dopaminergic drugs (fluphenazine, sulpiride, tiapride, metoclopramide, piquindone, tetrabenazine), clonazepam, calcium channel antagonists, botulinum toxin, dopamine agonists, selegiline, and other drugs is discussed. The drugs of choice for OCD in patients with Tourette's disorder are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), although the tricyclic antidepressant clomiplamine, which inhibits both serotonin and noradrenaline uptake, has also been found to be useful. ADHD can be treated with some psychostimulants, mainly methylphenidate, although these drugs must be used with caution. Other potentially useful drugs for the treatment of ADHD in patients with Tourette's disorder are clonidine, guanfacine, selegiline, some tricyclic antidepressants, sertraline, pimozide and clonazepam. Finally, the potential value of some nonpharmacological therapies (hypnotherapy, biofeedback, conductual therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, acupuncture and surgery) is briefly reviewed.",

Ninety-eight percent of acute poisonings were self-inflicted, and 90% occurred at home. Drugs were used in 134 (79%) suicide attempts. Eighty-one acute poisonings were caused by benzodiazepines (48%) and 19 by antidepressants (11%). Alcohol intoxication, alone or combined with the intake of psychoactive drug (28 cases, 16%) predominated in men. Cocaine was the most common narcotic drug, taken by 31 patients (16%). Other acute poisonings involved ecstasy (4 cases), CO (6 cases), and HCl inhalation (2 cases). Previous suicide attempts due to depression were found in 68 patients (40%). Fifty patients (29%) were comatose on admission, 24 were transferred to intensive care, and 3 died. Data such as these can be very useful for handling self-inflicted acute poisonings and for planning long-term health care activities.",

Dispensed prescriptions issued between December 1996 and May 1998 provided exposure data. Questionnaires sent to general practitioners provided outcomes. Frequently reported AEs were: drowsiness/sedation (n = 19), extrapyramidal disorder (n = 13) and unspecified side-effects (n = 33). Events with highest incidence density in first month and reason for stopping were: drowsiness/sedation [n = 153, incidence density (ID)1 18.9], weight gain (n = 117, ID1 8.9) and malaise/lassitude (n = 65, ID1 5.2). Extrapyramidal disorders were more common in elderly population (> 70 years, ID1 3.6, risk 26.0 per 1,000 patients) compared to < 70 years (ID1 1.1, risk 8.4 per 1,000 patients). Serious suspected adverse reactions were neuroleptic malignant syndrome (n = 1) and angioneurotic ooedema (n = 2).

    "113": "Contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle in response to a sudden loud sound (acoustic startle response) and the N1/P2 component of the auditory evoked potential are both attenuated when a brief low-intensity stimulus is presented 30-500 ms before the 'startle-eliciting' stimulus (prepulse inhibition). We examined the effects of two sedative/anxiolytic drugs, diazepam and clonidine, on prepulse inhibition of these two responses in healthy volunteers. Fifteen males (aged 18-35 years) participated in three sessions in which they received oral doses of placebo, diazepam 10 mg and clonidine 0.2 mg according to a balanced double-blind protocol. Thirty-minute simultaneous recordings of the electromyographic (EMG) responses of the orbicularis oculi muscle of the right eye and the vertex auditory evoked potentials took place 120 min after ingestion of clonidine and 60 min after ingestion of diazepam. Sound stimuli (1 kHz) were presented in 60 trials separated by variable intervals (mean 25 s): (i) 40-ms 115-dB ('pulse alone', 20 trials); (ii) 40-ms 85-dB (20 trials); (iii) 40-ms 85-dB, followed after 120 ms by 40-ms 115-dB ('prepulse/pulse', 20 trials). Mean amplitudes of the EMG response and the N1/P2 potential were derived from the pulse-alone trials and, in each case, percentage prepulse inhibition was calculated. The amplitude of the EMG response was significantly reduced both by diazepam and by clonidine; neither drug significantly altered prepulse inhibition of the EMG response. Diazepam, but not clonidine, significantly reduced the amplitude of the N1/P2 potential; neither drug significantly affected prepulse inhibition of the N1/P2 potential. Both drugs reduced self-rated alertness and anxiety, and systolic blood pressure; clonidine, but not diazepam reduced diastolic blood pressure and salivation. The results confirm previous findings that sedative drugs can suppress the startle response without affecting prepulse inhibition of this response, and provide new information on the effects of these drugs on the N1/P2 potential and its inhibition by prepulses.",

Though sharing common chemical backbone, 2,3-BDZs are pharmacologically different. Over the clinically non-sedative anxiolytic parent compound tofisopam, further derivatives with specific distribution of selective binding sites in the CNS have been found. Furthermore, dopamine-uptake inhibitors with stimulant character were also described. Finally but most importantly compounds with unusually broad anticonvulsant spectrum were also discovered. From this latter series the first non-competitive AMPA antagonist, GYKI-52,466 serves today as the golden standard for investigating the glutamate neurotransmission and the therapeutical potential of glutamate antagonists. The present paper summarizes the main pharmacological actions of the most prominent members of the 2,3-BDZ family.",

Medication charts for 1301 patients aged 65 years and over were reviewed to identify patients prescribed a benzodiazepine. Using an evidence-based indicator of prescribing appropriateness, cross-sectional notes-based audits were conducted at three time points (baseline, 4-8 weeks and 6 months). Feedback of baseline audit results was provided to medical, pharmacy and nursing staff at multidisciplinary meetings. Changes in benzodiazepine prescribing over the following 6 months were assessed.",

Four to six weeks after feedback, the proportion of patients prescribed a benzodiazepine had not changed significantly (31%, P = 0.125); however, more prescriptions were appropriate (44%, P < 0.0001). For patients who were using a benzodiazepine prior to admission and had a contraindication, there were more attempts to withdraw or reduce the dose (47% vs 21%, P = 0.002) and more prescriptions were for acceptable indications (7.4% vs 2.6%, P = 0.024).

    "121": "A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of 15 low-dosed benzodiazepines, both parent compounds and their corresponding metabolites, in human urine. The target compounds are alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, 4-hydroxyalprazolam, flunitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, desmethylflunitrazepam, flurazepam, hydroxyethylflurazepam, nitrogen-desalkylflurazepam, ketazolam, oxazepam, lormetazepam, lorazepam, triazolam and alpha-hydroxytriazolam. Nitrogen-methylclonazepam is used as the internal standard. The urine sample preparation involves enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites with Helix pomatia beta-glucuronidase for 1 h at 56 degrees C followed by solid-phase extraction on a phenyl-type column. The extracted benzodiazepines are subsequently analyzed on a polydimethylsiloxane column using on-column injection to enhance sensitivity. The extraction efficiency exceeded 80% for all compounds except for oxazepam, lorazepam and 4-hydroxyalprazolam which had recoveries of about 60%. The LODs ranged from 13 to 30 ng/ml in the scan mode and from 1.0 to 1.7 ng/ml in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration ranges from 50 to 1000 ng/ml in the scan mode and from 5 to 100 ng/ml in the SIM mode. The within-day and day-to-day relative standard deviations at three different concentrations never exceeded 15%.", 
    "122": "Anaesthesiologists administer a wide variety of drugs, including benzodiazepines, opioids, intravenous anaesthetic agents, volatile anaesthetic agents, muscle relaxants, local anaesthetics, and other drugs, especially those influencing the cardiovascular system. Sometimes a drug is chosen because of its better effect and/or side-effect profile. However, many of the drugs within each group have similar effect and/or side-effect profiles and differ mainly in their pharmacokinetics. The choice of one drug over another may then need to be based on differences in their pharmacokinetic profiles. Traditional predictors of onset of drug effect, such as time to a specified effect, are dose-dependent. Traditional predictors of offset of drug effect, such as 'terminal half-life', often have little clinical relevance. Newer descriptors offer significant advantages. The time to peak effect-site concentration is an informative dose-independent descriptor of the onset of drug effect following an intravenous bolus dose. The relevant decrement time (for continuous measures of drug effect) and mean effect time (for binary measures of drug effect) build upon the context-sensitive half-time concept, by considering the time required for the concentrations to decrease from one clinically relevant level of drug effect to another.", 
    "123": "Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurologic disorders and affects approximately 1% of the population. Most complex seizures arise from the temporal lobes and the condition of 20-30% of these patients is refractory to medication. Many can be rendered seizure free with surgery. Epilepsy surgery requires accurate identification of the site and extent of the epileptogenic area responsible for seizures. EEG is accepted as a gold standard, however only 50% of the patients are safely diagnosed. The need for invasive monitoring with possible hemorrhage or infection has been greatly reduced by the introduction of new technologies such as PET, SPECT and MRI in the clinical practice. MRI demonstrate morphologic changes in approximately 80% of patients with epilepsy. However, structural lesions may not always correlate with clinical, EEG and pathologic localization of epileptogenic foci. Seizures are associated with pronounced changes in regional cerebral blood flow. The real power of SPECT lies in the opportunity of ictal examinations, with a sensitivity ranging from 90 to 97%. Interictal PET studies using 18F-FDG measure regional glucose metabolism, have been investigated for their value as non-invasive focus-localizing techniques. These studies have sensitivity ranging from 80 to 85%. The benzodiazepine binding site that are associated with and modulate the activity of GABA receptors have been imaged by SPECT (using 123I-iomazenil) and PET (using 11C-Flumazenil). Combined measurements of benzodiazepine binding sites and perfusion/metabolism provide a more accurate visualization of epileptogenic site than perfusion or metabolism measurements alone. Functional imaging modalities (PET and SPECT) are highly important in the presurgical evaluation of patients with medically refractory complex partial seizures.",

    "128": "To develop an alternative anaesthetic regimen for cats with cardiomyopathy, the cardiopulmonary effects of three different premedication-induction protocols, followed by one hour maintenance with isoflurane in oxygen: air were evaluated in six cats. Group I: acepromazine (10 microg/kg) + buprenorphine (10 microg/kg) IM, etomidate (1-2 mg/kg) IV induction. Group II: midazolam (1 mg/kg) + ketamine (10 mg/kg) IM induction. Group III: medetomidine (1.5 mg/m2 body surface) IM, propofol (1-2 mg/kg) IV induction. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood gases, respiration rate, and temperature were recorded for the duration of the experiment. In group I the sedative effect after premedication was limited. In the other groups the level of sedation was sufficient. In all groups premedication resulted in a reduced blood pressure which decreased further immediately following induction. The reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) reached statistical significance in group I (142+/-22 to 81+/-14 mmHg) and group II (153+/-28 to 98+/-20 mmHg) but not in group III (165+/-24 to 134+/-29 mmHg). Despite the decrease in blood pressure, MAP was judged to have remained within an acceptable range in all groups. During maintenance of anaesthesia, heart rate decreased significantly in group III (from 165+/-24 to 125+/-10 b.p.m. at t=80 min). During anaesthesia the PCO2 and PO2 values increased significantly in all groups. On the basis of the results, the combination acepromazine-buprenorphine is preferred because heart rate, MAP, and respiration are acceptable, it has a limited sedative effect but recovery is smooth.", 
    "129": "A clinical study was conducted to assess the ability of commercially available immunoassays to detect flunitrazepam (FNP) in plasma and urine samples and to compare the results with those obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The clinical study consisted of four individuals (two male and two female) who had taken a single 2-mg dose of FNP. Serum was collected over a 48-h period and urine was collected over a 72-h period. The serum and urine samples were analyzed by the COBAS INTEGRA Serum Benzodiazepines assay (SBENZ), the TDx serum and urine Benzodiazepines assay, and GC-MS. The GC-MS procedure was developed for analysis of FNP and metabolites in plasma and urine using an acid hydrolysis step resulting in the formation of specific benzophenones corresponding to FNP and its metabolites. The relative sensitivities of the assays for the detection of FNP and metabolites in serum and urine were GC-MS > SBENZ > TDx. The immunoassay results for serum samples showed peak concentrations of FNP metabolites at 8 h after FNP ingestion for three individuals and at about 1 h for the fourth individual. The GC-MS, SBENZ, and TDx urine immunoassays detected drug above the stated limit of detection (LOD) in 44, 41, and 35 serial FNP urine samples, respectively. FNP metabolites were detected in urine samples with all three assays for up to 72 h after a 2-mg dose. The improved detection rate with the SBENZ assay as compared to the TDx assay is likely explained by its higher cross-reactivity with the major metabolite, 7-amino-flunitrazepam (7-amino-FNP), and its lower LOD.", 
    "130": "This study tested the effects of the sedative-hypnotic drug triazolam (Halcion) on the ability to inhibit behavior in humans. Thirty adults practiced a stop-signal task that measured their ability to inhibit and activate behavioral responses on a choice reaction time task. Equal numbers of participants (i.e., n = 10) then received either 0.25 mg, 0.125 mg, or 0 mg (placebo) of triazolam under double-blind conditions and performed the task intermittently over a 3-hr period. In accord with the hypothesis, triazolam reduced response inhibitions and increased the time required to inhibit a response. The drug also slowed the activation of responses. The findings contribute to the understanding of the basic behavioral mechanisms by which sedative-hypnotic drugs can produce states of behavioral disinhibition in some individuals.",

    "132": "The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pirenzepine in the treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation. Pirenzepine is reported to counteract hypersalivation by its selective antagonistic activity on the M4-muscarinic receptor, which is stimulated by clozapine. Twenty patients with clozapine-induced hypersalivation underwent a random-order, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial which lasted 8 weeks each for the pirenzepine and placebo investigations, with a 4-week washout period in between. The severity of hypersalivation was assessed using an objective measure: saliva production monitored through the diameter of wetted surface on tissue paper placed over the patient's pillow. Our study showed that pirenzepine had no significant therapeutic effect on hypersalivation compared with placebo, suggesting that hypersalivation induced by clozapine might have a neurobiological basis other than the M4-muscarinic receptor.",

Patients received the administration of clonazepam and/or carbamazepine. The final model describing clonazepam clearance was CL = 179.0 x TBW(-0.231) x 1.22(CBZ), where CL is total body clearance (mL/kg/h) and TBW is total body weight (kg); CBZ = 1 for concomitant administration of carbamazepine and CBZ = zero otherwise. The final model describing carbamazepine clearance was CL = 92.7 x TBW(-0.394) x DOSE(0-397) x 0.795(CZP), where DOSE is the daily dose of carbamazepine (mg/kg/day); CZP = 1 for concomitant administration of clonazepam and CZP = zero otherwise. Concomitant administration of clonazepam and carbamazepine resulted in a 22% increase in clonazepam clearance and a 20.5% decrease in carbamazepine clearance.", 
    "134": "In addition to dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been reported to play an important role in schizophrenia. Besides blocking dopamine, atypical antipsychotics also block 5-HT receptors. The clinical efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine is associated with the 5-HT antagonistic action of the drug and a high serotonergic tone before treatment. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has a receptor-binding profile similar to that of clozapine. The present study investigated whether treatment with olanzapine blocks hormone release induced by the 5-HT2c agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and, if so, whether this 5-HT antagonistic effect is related to treatment response. Eighteen male schizophrenic patients participated in this study. All patients were challenged with m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg orally) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design after a drug-free period of at least 2 weeks. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels were measured every 30 minutes up to 210 minutes after challenge. Patients were treated for 6 weeks with 10 mg olanzapine daily in an open design, after which the challenge tests were repeated. Olanzapine significantly blocked m-CPP-induced ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin release, suggesting that it is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo. This 5-HT antagonistic effect of olanzapine was not significantly correlated with treatment response. Also, no significant correlation was found between m-CPP-induced hormone release before treatment and clinical response after treatment with olanzapine. These findings suggest that olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo but that this is unrelated to its clinical efficacy in this nonrefractory sample of schizophrenic patients.", 
    "135": "The first-dose pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its primary alpha-hydroxymetabolite were studied after single-dose administration. Eligible study patients were enrolled into one of three study arms: Arm I (midazolam/metabolite pharmacokinetic evaluation after oral administration of a syrup formulation), Arm II (the absolute bioavailability of midazolam syrup), and Arm III (midazolam and metabolite pharmacokinetics after IV administration). Complete blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis was available in 87 subjects. Midazolam absorption after administration of the oral syrupformulation was rapid, with adolescents absorbing the drug at approximately half the rate observed in younger children (ages 2 to < 12 years). Furthermore, midazolam t 1/2 was prolonged and CL/F reducedin adolescents as compared with younger children. Although the midazolam Vd/F appeared larger in the youngest age group after oral administration, this observation was not apparent after IV dosing, suggesting subject differences in bioavailability rather than distribution. Like midazolam, the disposition characteristics for a-hydroxymidazolam were also highly variable, with the greatest formation of metabolite (reflected by the AUC ratio) observed in children ages 2 to < 12 years. The A UC ratios of alpha-hydroxymidazolam to midazolam after IV dosing were similar across all age groups and were smaller than corresponding values following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of midazolam averaged 36% with a very broad range (9%-71%). No relationship between midazolam bioavailability and age was observed. Overall, the disposition characteristics of midazolam and its a-hydroxy metabolite were highly variable, appeared independent of age and dose administered, and were linear over the dose range studied (0.25 to 1 mg/kg). These data suggest that an initial oral dose of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg should be adequateforsuccessful sedation of most pediatric patients. The inherent variability in midazolam bioavailability and metabolism underscores the importance of titrating midazolam dose to desired effect.", 
    "136": "Cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) has been shown to reduce risk for adverse reactions (e.g., rebound panic) following benzodiazepine taper for patients with panic disorder (PD). This study evaluated the effects of antidepressant discontinuation for patients with PD in the context of CBT. Patients with PD (n=21) on a stable dose of antidepressants completed a 12-week group CBT treatment and were randomly assigned to discontinue antidepressants during week 8 of the treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between groups at posttreatment or 6-month follow-up. Data indicate no apparent immediate or long-term adverse effects for antidepressant discontinuation for patients with PD receiving CBT.", 
    "137": "Several advances are likely to benefit the ICU patient requiring sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis. The cooperative sedation induced by dexmedetomidine is a unique and valuable state that allows patients to be aroused easily and interferes little with ventilation. Remifentanil is the prototype of short-acting drugs, providing fast onset and offset; its relatively high cost may be balanced by limiting the risk for long-lasting respiratory depression. Lorazepam seems to be finding more proponents, especially in long-term ICU sedation where the costs of the newer agents may be prohibitive.", 
    "138": "Sedatives continue to be used on a routine basis in critically ill patients. Although many agents are available and some approach an ideal, none are perfect. Patients require continuous reassessment of their pain and need for sedation. Pathophysiologic abnormalities that cause agitation, confusion, or delirium must be identified and treated before unilateral administration of potent sedative agents that may mask potentially lethal insufficiencies. The routine use of standardized and validated sedation scales and monitors is needed. It is hoped that reliable objective monitors of patients' level of consciousness and comfort will be forthcoming. Each sedative agent discussed in this article seems to have a place in the ICU pharmacologic armamentarium to ensure the safe and comfortable delivery of care. Etomidate is an attractive agent for short-term use to provide the rapid onset and offset of sedation in critically ill patients who are at risk for hemodynamic instability but seem to need sedation or anesthesia to perform a procedure or manipulate the airway. Ketamine administered through intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion provides quick, intense analgesia and anesthesia and allows patients to tolerate limited but painful procedures. The risk/benefit ratio associated with the use of this neuroleptic agent must be weighed carefully. Ketamine is contraindicated in patients who lack normal intracranial compliance or who have significant myocardial ischemia. Barbiturates are reserved mainly to induce coma in patients at risk for severe CNS ischemia, which frequently is associated with refractory intracranial hypertension, or in patients with status epilepticus. When administered in high doses, these drugs have prolonged sedative and depressant effects. Judicious hemodynamic monitoring is required when barbiturate coma is induced. Haloperidol is indicated in the treatment of delirium. Patients should be monitored for extrapyramidal side effects and, when they require higher doses, for potential electrocardiographic prolongation of the QT interval. Dexmedetomidine may evolve into an agent with qualities comparable with midazolam and propofol, and it may even become a drug of choice in select patients. Further study is required, however. Propofol has many of the qualities of an ideal sedative agent. Benzodiazepines and narcotics often are used in concert with propofol to provide reliable amnesia and to relieve pain, respectively. Propofol frequently causes hypotension when administered as a bolus or infusion, particularly in patients with limited cardiac reserve or hypovolemia. More data must be obtained to identify potential deleterious effects of hypertriglyceridemia, and further evaluation of the potential benefits in certain patient populations, such as neurosurgical patients, is needed.", 
    "139": "The effects of BZ drugs result from interaction at the GABAA receptor within the CNS, producing anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia in a dose-dependent fashion. These sedative effects are best titrated to reproducible clinical endpoints, using scoring systems such as the Ramsay scale. All BZs exhibit similar pharmacologic effects, but the important differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics should be recognized to use these drugs safely and effectively within the ICU. Diazepam is the classic anxiolytic, amnestic, and sedative agent, but the presence of long-acting active metabolites that depend on the kidneys for elimination limits its use in many ICU patients. Lorazepam is the most potent BZ used in the ICU; it has stable pharmacokinetics and relatively low cost. This drug is best reserved for situations in which rapid onset is not essential and long-term sedation is anticipated. Midazolam has the shortest t1/2 of the commonly used BZs, generates few active metabolites, and is water soluble at physiologic pH. Thus, it is well suited for continuous infusion in the ICU, and the recent introduction of generic formulations of midazolam has decreased the drug-acquisition cost for many hospitals. Optimal sedation for ICU patients often requires BZ and concomitant therapy with drugs such as haloperidol, dexmedetomidine, opioids, and so forth, to reduce untoward side effects and, perhaps, overall drug costs. Flumazenil, a specific BZ antagonist, can be used for diagnostic or therapeutic reversal of BZ agonists when appropriate. Most experienced intensivists recommend an individualized approach to sedation and titration of anxiolysis to maximize efficacy, minimize side effects, and optimize cost effectiveness in the ICU. New CNS monitors of the EEG, such as the BIS or entropy EEG monitors, may refine titration algorithms further in the near future.", 
    "140": "Intravenous sedation and analgesia are cornerstones of the pharmacologic management of the critically ill, mechanically ventilated adult patient. No conclusive evidence exists to support any single optimal sedative or analgesic regimen in this heterogeneous population. The role of cost effectiveness in the process of selecting a regimen is explored with a review of the literature, followed by proposed cost-effectiveness models and recommendations for the clinical practitioner.", 
    "141": "The relative works to the psychopathological aspects of benzodiazepines (BZD) addiction in elderly persons make the object of a large debate because the question of addiction remains whole. They concern: 1) the influence of age on the level of consumption of the BZD. The research permits to clear 4 explanatory major factors of the relation observed between age and the consumption of BZD: a) the morbidity increased of the aged people, b) the impact of the painful life events, c) the social isolation, d) the weight of the medical prescription; 2) the concepts of dependence (evolution of the definitions, type of physical, psychic or psychopathological dependencies) and of addiction (definitions, place in the international classifications, psychopathological perspective); 3) the reports of the anxiety and the depression with BZD addiction in elderly persons. To the look of these works, the objectives of this present study were to examine the variability of BZD addiction on the one hand within a population weakened by the effects of age (apparition of a chronic illness, for example) and on the other hand the relations that the anxious and depressive symptoms maintain with BZD addiction in elderly persons. Two self-questionnaires were administered: 1) BZD addiction scale, 2) Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD) to 28 elderly (18 women and 10 men; mean age is 73.25 years). To the exit of this work, the results put in evidence go in the sense of our hypotheses but cannot be generalized to the set of the elderly consumers of BZD, they let appear that age, the depression and the association anxiety/depression predict meaningful manner BZD addiction. Indeed, with regard to age, the polypathology as well as the changes of life induced by the aging process involved BZD addiction in old people. The old age can engender a depression that results in addictive behavior. However, anxiety alone is not experienced before drug addiction in a significant way. This result can explain itself by the fact that the anxiety is a symptom of depression. The present research is unique in several important aspects. First, the study shows that drug addiction in old people cannot be reduced to physiological addiction on product but understood in terms of a complex process requiring an analysis of the psychological addiction on product. Second, BZD addiction in the elderly acts as a psychological/existential medical care. Future research is needed to examine the psychological and psychopathological links that old people maintain with their drug medication.", 
    "142": "A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE: Mourning characterizes the grief of a person who has lost a loved one forever. The bereavement that follows is natural and should not be medicated. Mourning is not a disease; it is one of the most painful facts of life. In fact, the more we are attached to someone, the more we will suffer his or her loss. This is unavoidable. The grief expressing our attachment is accompanied by immediate and intense regression with repeated need for consolation. For some people, it can be the means of coming to terms with their own mortality. THE STAGES OF MOURNING: There are several stages of mourning: the living person's ambivalence toward the deceased, the recollection corresponding to the progressive acceptance of the loss, which represents the first phase of the mourning process. During the healing phase, the mourner is gradually capable of recalling the good times during the life of the deceased and then progressively of evacuating the souvenirs and start living and opening up to others again. COMPLICATED MOURNING: Mourning may be passionate and characterized by the refusal to integrate the loss, or delayed, with an apparent lack of grief and sorrow. Chronic depression is a sort of greater degree of severity compared with delayed mourning. A denial mechanism installs: the loved one is not dead and will return. A split in personality can be observed: part of the person will integrate the reality; the other will retreat from it. In this case, recollection will not lead to integration of the loss. Somatization disorders or organic problems can be observed and more rarely grief melancholia, mania, hysteria or obsessional grief. These are the domain of the specialist. GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE PHYSICIAN: Reality is always preferable to imagination. Listening to the patient must precede any medication. In severe cases of grief, sedative antidepressors are preferable and the co-prescription of anxiolytics, particularly benzodiazepines should be avoided. One should not hesitate to seek advice from a specialist.", 
    "143": "The antiemetic effect of ondansetron-dexamethasone-lorazepam versus those of metoclopramide-dexamethasone-lorazepam were evaluated in 30 ovarian cancer patients undergoing treatment with the same chemotherapeutic regimen (cisplatin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 700 mg/m2). Patients were randomly selected to receive either the ondansetron arm or the metoclopramide arm in their first cycle of chemotherapy, but were given an alternative combination in the second cycle. In the ondansetron arm, ondansetron was given 8 mg intravenously (i.v.) plus dexamethasone 20 mg i.v. and lorazepam 0.5 mg oral. For the metoclopramide arm, metoclopramide 10 mg was given i.v. plus dexamethasone 20 mg i.v. and lorazepam 0.5 mg oral. All antiemetics were given twice; 30 minutes before and 6 hours after chemotherapy. In the metoclopramide arm, metoclopramide 40 mg continuous infusion was also administered. During the acute phase, the ondansetron combination was significantly superior to the metoclopramide combination for all evaluation parameters. Complete control of emesis was 90 per cent vs 36.7 per cent, complete protection from nausea was 80 per cent vs 43.3 per cent, and complete protection from both nausea and vomiting was 73.3 per cent vs 30.0 per cent. Forty per cent of patients in the ondansetron arm did not complain of any adverse reaction compared to 13.4 per cent in the metoclopramide arm. It can be concluded, therefore, that a combination of ondansetron, dexamethasone and lorazepam appears to provide a significantly better emetic control with less adverse reaction than the metoclopramide combination in the acute nausea-vomiting phase after receiving cisplatin.", 
    "144": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding ketamine to standard emergency department (ED) therapy for patients with status asthmaticus. This was a prospective observational study. Ten patients with an acute exacerbation of asthma who were unresponsive to standard therapy were enrolled in the ED. Upon enrollment, children received ketamine at a loading dose of 1 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.), followed by a continuous infusion of 0.75 mg/kg/hr (12.5 microg/kg/min) for 1 hr. Clinical asthma score (CAS), vital signs, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements were obtained prior to ketamine administration, within 10 min after ketamine administration was completed, and 1 hr after infusion. Median CAS on ED arrival was 15 (range 7-23) and did not significantly change immediately prior to infusion of ketamine (median 14, range 8-21). Median CAS decreased to 10.5 immediately after infusion and to 9.51 hr post ketamine infusion (37% reduction, p < 0.05 by ANOVA vs. preketamine CAS). Median respiratory rate (RR) also decreased from 39 prior to ketamine to 30 immediately following ketamine administration (25% decrease vs. preketamine; p < 0.05). Oxygen saturation significantly improved after ketamine infusion, although 5 patients remained on oxygen. Median PEF improved after infusion, but was not statistically significant. Four patients experienced mild side effects including mild hallucinations, diffuse flushing, and moderate hypertension. Side effects resolved with benzodiazepines or with discontinuation of the infusion. Addition of ketamine to standard therapy was associated with improved indices of acute asthma severity. Side effects were transitory and comparable to previous studies. However, a double-blinded randomized controlled trial needs to be conducted to determine if improvement is attributable to the addition of ketamine to standard asthma therapy.", 
    "145": "Seizures in the newborn period constitute a medical emergency. Subtle seizures are mild paroxysmal alterations in motor or autonomic activity and are unique to the neonatal period. They are likely to be missed or confused with benign movements observed commonly in preterm children. Focal clonic seizures have a better prognosis as compared to myoclonic seizures for long-term neuro-developmental outcome. Seizures due to sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and late onset hypocalcemia carry a better prognosis as compared to seizures due to hypoglycemia, meningitis and cerebral malformations. Hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia are common causes and should be excluded in all neonates with seizures. Multiple etiologies can co-exist in neonatal seizures and a comprehensive approach for management of neonatal seizures has been described.", 
    "146": "We report on two schizophrenic females who both had unexpected first pregnancies in their mid-thirties while being treated with olanzapine. Both patients had histories of psychosis of several years with some relapses and were treated previously with traditional antipsychotics. Since they wished to have children, no contraception had been performed past the age of 30. Both pregnancies occurred within a few months after the drug treatment was switched from traditional agents to olanzapine. Olanzapine was continued throughout the pregnancies, which were without complication. It is well known that treatment with traditional neuroleptics may lead to elevated prolactin levels and thus to relative infertility. Like clozapine, olanzapine has minimal effects on prolactin levels. These cases indicate that after switching from traditional neuroleptics to atypical agents, fertility may normalize and unplanned or even unwanted pregnancies may occur. Since olanzapine is widely prescribed, it is essential to inform women about the increased probability of pregnancy and the need of appropriate contraception.", 
    "147": "We studied prospectively the epidemiology, clinical impact and prediction of falls in 59 moderately affected patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (mean UPDRS motor score 31.5; mean age 61 years) and 55 controls (mean age 60 years). At baseline, balance and gait were evaluated extensively. The retropulsion test (response to sudden shoulder pull) was executed first unexpectedly and five more times following prior warning. All persons used standardised scoring forms to document their falls during six months. Thirty patients (50.8 %) and eight controls (14.5%) fell at least once (relative risk [RR] 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-15.1, p < 0.001). Recurrent (> or = 2) falls occurred in 15 patients (25.4%), but in only two controls (RR 9.0; 95 % CI 2.0-41.7; p=0.001). Recurrent falls were more common among persons taking benzodiazepines (RR 5.0; 95% CI 1.6-15.5; p < 0.01). Sixty-two percent of the falls in patients caused soft tissue injuries, but no fractures occurred. A fear of future falls was common (45.8 % of patients) and was accompanied by restriction of daily activities (44.1 % of patients). Seventy percent of falls reported by patients were'intrinsic' (due to patient-related factors), but falls in controls were mainly (50%) 'extrinsic' (due to environmental factors). None of the baseline posture and gait variables predicted falls adequately. The first 'unexpected' retropulsion test was more often abnormal than all subsequent (predictable) tests. Irrespective of its method of execution, the retropulsion test did not predict falls. A combination of asking for prior falls, disease severity and the Romberg test yielded the best overall diagnostic utility (sensitivity 65 % and specificity 98 %). Recurrent fallers were best predicted by disease severity (RR for Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 was > 100; 95% CI 3.1-585) and asking for prior falls (RR 5.0; 95% CI 1.2-20.9). We conclude that falls are common and disabling, even in relatively early stage PD. Recurrent fallers were best predicted by disease severity and presence of prior falls. Strategies to prevent falls in PD should particularly focus at intrinsic (patient-related) factors, such as minimising the use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "148": "The diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), initially isolated as an endogenous 10-kDa polypeptide from the brain, has the ability to displace ligands from benzodiazepine binding sites on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. However, DBI is widely distributed outside the brain, with the highest expression in the intestine. The present in situ hybridization study revealed the cellular expression of DBI mRNA throughout the gastrointestinal tract of mice, showing it to be intensely expressed in the spinous layer in the stratified squamous epithelium of the oral cavity, esophagus and forestomach, in surface mucous cells in the glandular stomach, and in columnar (absorptive) cells of the intestinal villi. A precise identification of DBI-expressing cell types was confirmed immunohistochemically, although the expressing cells detectable by the two histochemical methods differed slightly in their extension. Noteworthily, DBI always coexisted with the fatty acid binding protein (FABP), which participates in the uptake and metabolic processing of long chain fatty acids. In addition to the biochemical finding that DBI is identical with the acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), the distributional patterns of DBI and its colocalization with FABPs suggests its involvement in the absorption and metabolism of lipid in the epithelia of the digestive tract.", 
    "149": "Cumulative data indicate that atypical antipsychotics can serve as adjunctive as well as alternative agents in the treatment of drug-resistant mood disorders. Olanzapine and risperidone add-on treatment was found to be effective for major depression with psychotic features and good results were achieved with currently available atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone) in reducing symptoms of acute mania, especially when added to mood stabilizers. The role of atypical antipsychotics in maintenance and prophylactic treatment is not yet clear. Although there are differences in the side effect profiles of the various atypical antipsychotics, their use is limited by adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, somnolence and sexual dysfunction.", 
    "150": "Insomnia in patients with heart transplantation and cardiac disease is a common problem. Organic factors, immunodepressant medication (e.g. ciclosporine and steroids) and psychological factors may account for this symptom. The article reviews different hypnotic drugs and their value in the treatment of insomnia. For short-time treatment, medication with benzodiazepine hypnotics may be useful. If the problems of drug dependence and rebound insomnia are taken into consideration, treatment with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics offers more safety and comfort. If insomnia is part of a depressive syndrome, pharmacotherapeutical intervention with antidepressive sedative medication is required. With regard to cardiac disease, treatment with mirtazapine, nefazodone or trazodone should be preferred because of the chinidine-like effect of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Sedative neuroleptic medication (e.g. melperone) is commonly given to geriatric patients; nevertheless, patients with chronic insomnia may also benefit from this medication. The risks and benefits of hypnotic drugs are discussed especially in relation to pharmacological interaction (cytochrome system) and cardiac disease.", 
    "151": "Two new variants of total intravenous anesthesia with spontaneous respiration were used in 307 female patients subjected to noncavitary interventions for cancer and gynecological cancer. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) total anesthesia with midasolam, fentanyl, and calipsol and 2) the same + propofol. Preventive analgesia by preoperative injections of peripheral analgesics was carried out in both groups. Both methods proved to be effective, ensuring good protection from traumatic noncavitary oncological operations. Balanced anesthesia with two hypnotics midasolam and propofol should be preferred, as they mutually potentiate their effects and therefore can be used in the minimum doses, thus preventing the probable side effects, minimizing the use of central analgesics, and ruling out the probability of respiration depression."
