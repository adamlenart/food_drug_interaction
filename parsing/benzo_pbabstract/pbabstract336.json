    "1": "Patients were sedated with midazolam and fentanyl and then had maintenance of an anesthetic state achieved with propofol administered by either of the two techniques. Data were collected to evaluate the overall surgical/anesthetic procedure, movement of the patient, and his or her hemodynamic status.", 
    "2": "Both groups received a mean maintenance dose of propofol exceeding 6 mg/kg/hr. However, the patients in the continuous infusion group received a statistically greater maintenance dose (continuous infusion + supplemental vs incremental bolus). All patients were maintained in a deep sedation/general anesthetic state. Respiratory and blood pressure values were comparable in both groups. However, the continuous infusion group showed improved hemodynamic stability manifested as fewer fluctuations in heart rate. Visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires completed by the surgeon and surgical assistant reported less patient movement and improved surgical/anesthetic conditions with the continuous infusion technique. Recovery of the two groups was comparable.", 
    "3": "This study, although finding advantages in the continuous infusion technique, showed satisfactory conditions associated with both techniques.", 
    "4": "Huntington's disease transgenic mice were tested in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety at 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks of age. At all ages, they showed significant and striking increases in the percentages of open arm entries and time spent on the open arms, compared with their normal littermates, indicating reduced anxiety. These increases were not secondary to a non-specific stimulant effect, since the transgenic mice made fewer closed arm entries, significantly so from 10 weeks of age. The mice were also tested in the holeboard, which provides measures of locomotor activity and directed exploration. From 8 weeks of age, the Huntington's mice were significantly less active than their normal littermates and made fewer exploratory head-dips. The increased open arm activity in the elevated plus-maze cannot therefore be secondary to increased exploration in the transgenic mice. In order to determine whether the reduced anxiety was due to differences in benzodiazepine receptor function, the mice were challenged with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil. The results indicated that some of the reduced anxiety could be attributed to the presence of an endogenous anxiolytic ligand.", 
    "5": "In this study, we investigated the modulatory effect of 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one, a neurosteroid, on the binding characteristics of [3H]flunitrazepam (2 nM), [3H]muscimol (5 nM), and 4 nM [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus of control, ethanol-dependent, and ethanol-withdrawn rats. 5alpha-Pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one potentiated the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol in all the rat brain regions investigated in this study. There was a significant increase in the maximal potentiation of [3H]flunitrazepam as well as [3H]muscimol binding (Emax) in the ethanol-dependent rat cerebellum as compared to control group (p<0. 025). Furthermore, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one elicited a biphasic response, i.e., it potentiated the binding of [35S]TBPS at lower concentrations (<=100 nM) and inhibited the binding at higher concentrations (>100 nM). There was a significant higher inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding (-Emax) by 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one in the hippocampus of ethanol-dependent as well as ethanol-withdrawn rats (p<0.025). These observations suggest that the neurosteroid binding site associated with the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors in cerebellum and hippocampus plays an important role during ethanol-dependence and ethanol-withdrawal, and some of the changes following ethanol dependence and its withdrawal may be mediated through the neurosteroid binding site.", 
    "6": "In humans, a major metabolite of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine in the plasma and in the urine was found to be an N-glucuronide. Unexpectedly, the glucuronic acid moiety was linked through a nitrogen of the benzodiazepine nucleus of olanzapine by way of a secondary amine linkage, rather than through a nitrogen on the piperazine substituent of the nucleus, to give a quaternary ammonium glucuronide. Derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate to yield a thiourea adduct indicated that conjugation occurred via a secondary amine. Subsequently, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance studies with the isolated metabolite and later with the synthesized metabolite indicated that the glucuronide was linked at the 10- position of olanzapine. This phase 2 metabolite was only detected in the plasma and urine of human subjects and not in mice, rats, or monkeys; a trace of this metabolite was detected in dog urine. The N-10 glucuronide was resistant to enzymatic and base hydrolysis but was cleaved under acidic conditions. Formation of an N-glucuronide metabolite directly with the benzodiazepine nucleus has not previously been reported.", 
    "7": "A multicentre, long-term, open-label, add-on study of vigabatrin was undertaken in 23 pretreated children with infantile spasms. After 3 months of vigabatrin therapy 11 of the 23 patients had become seizure-free. At this time two-thirds of these 11 children still received other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in addition to vigabatrin (mostly valproic acid and/or dexamethasone). After a mean follow-up time of 5 1/4 years (range: 4 1/4-6 1/2) 72% of 18 evaluable patients (two children died, three were lost to follow-up) revealed seizure freedom for at least 1 year. The mean duration of vigabatrin therapy had been 2 1/2 years (range: 2 weeks to 4 3/4 years). Two-thirds of the 18 children continued to take AEDs, three of them undergoing vigabatrin monotherapy. Relapses of infantile spasms had occurred in 14% of the children. The rate of vigabatrin side effects (10%) was low. At follow-up, the EEG of 13 and the 18 patients demonstrated focal or multifocal epileptic discharges. Fifty-five percent had developed another epilepsy (focal epilepsy, secondary generalized epilepsy or myoclonic-astatic epilepsy). With respect to mental functions, three children were normal or slightly retarded, four showed moderate retardation and 11 revealed severe or very severe retardation. This long-term result is comparable to that in ACTH studies with unselected patients. The conclusions are: (1) vigabatrin is an effective drug for the short-term and long-term treatment of refractory infantile spasms; (2) the relapse rate is low; (3) vigabatrin is well tolerated; (4) with respect to secondary epilepsies and mental functions the long-term outcome in these pretreated children is similar to that in earlier studies with ACTH or corticosteroids.", 
    "8": "The gene superfamily of ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) receptors is composed of members of excitatory LGIC receptors (ELGIC) and inhibitory LGIC receptors (ILGIC), all using amino acids as ligands. The ILGICs, including GABAA, Gly, and GluCl receptors, conduct Cl- when the ligand is bound. To evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among ILGIC members, 90 protein sequences were analyzed by both maximum-parsimony and distance matrix-based methods. The strength of the resulting phylogenetic trees was evaluated by means of bootstrap. Four major phylogenetic branches are recognized. Branch I, called BZ, for the majority of the members are known to be related to benzodiazepine binding, is subdivided into IA, composed of all GABAA receptor alpha subunits, and IB, composed of the gamma and epsilon subunits, which are shown to be tightly linked. Branch II, named NB for non-benzodiazepine binding, and consisting of GABAA receptor beta, delta, pi, and rho subunits, is further subdivided into IIA, containing beta subunits; IIB, containing delta, and pi subunits; and IIC, containing rho subunits. Branch IIIA, composed of vertebrate Gly receptors, is loosely clustered with Branch IIIB, composed of invertebrate GluCl receptors, to form Branch III, which is designated NA for being non-GABA responsive. Branch IV is called UD for being undefined in specificity. The existence of primitive forms of GABAA receptor non-beta subunits in invertebrates is first suggested by the present analysis, and the identities of sequences p25123 from Drosophila melanogaster, s34469 from Lymnaea stagnalis, and u14635 and p41849 from C. aenorhabditis elegans are determined to be different from their previously given annotations. The proposed branching classification of ILGICs provides a phylogenetic map, based on protein sequences, for tracing the evolutionary pathways of ILGIC receptor subunits and determining the identities of newly discovered subunits on the basis of their protein sequences.", 
    "9": "Previous studies in this laboratory have determined the lack of specificity of several antibody and substrate probes of CYP2B6. The goals of the current study were to examine the expression of CYP2B6 in a bank of human liver microsome (HLM) samples using a new specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 49-10-20) and to further characterize the substrate specificity of CYP2B6. A 100-fold variability in expression of immunodetectable CYP2B6 was demonstrated in a bank of 19 HLM samples (0.7 pmol/mg protein to 71. 1 pmol/mg protein) using MAb 49-10-20. CYP2B6 levels were found to significantly (P < .0001) correlate with S-mephenytoin N-demethylation to nirvanol (r2 = 0.89), 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin formation (r2 = 0.81) and several markers of CYP3A levels and activity. The relationships between nirvanol formation and CYP3A levels or activity were found to depend on two HLM samples. Km (apparent) values were generated for benzyloxyresorufin O-deethylation (1.3 microM), benzphetamine N-demethylation (93.4 microM), 3-cyano 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (71.3 microM), midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (46.1 microM) and 4-chloromethyl-7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (33.7 microM) using expressed CYP2B6. Testosterone 16beta-hydroxylation by expressed CYP2B6 resulted in atypical kinetics characteristic of substrate activation. The data best fit the Hill equation with a Km (apparent) of 50.5 microM and an n of 1.3 (n = number of sites bound by activator). In conclusion, the highly specific MAb 49-10-20 was used to provide further confirmation that S-mephenytoin N-demethylation to nirvanol is a CYP2B6 selective probe. Finally, some, but not all substrates of CYP2B6 demonstrate autoactivation.", 
    "10": "Given the high risk of postpartum psychiatric problems, clinicians need to be prepared to appropriately manage the breast-feeding woman who needs psychotropics. These psychiatric researchers examine the issues and offer guidelines. Following childbirth, many women are at high risk for the onset or recurrence of psychiatric illness. Women who need psychopharmacologic treatment may wish to breast-feed their infants, but the data regarding the degree of drug passage to the infant and the subsequent effects of this exposure on infant growth and development are very limited, leaving clinicians with little guidance for responding in ways that protect the health and well-being of both mother and infant. In general, the less protein-bound, the more lipid-soluble, and the more weakly basic a drug is, the more likely it is to diffuse into breast milk. When a psychotropic medication is administered, the infant's clinical status and serum concentrations, including metabolite concentrations, should be closely monitored. Among the agents that have been the subject of at least limited studies in breast-feeding women are tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and the mood stabilizers lithium, carbamazepine, and divalproex. This article examines the factors that influence infant exposure to psychotropic medication through breast-feeding and includes clinical guidelines for managing the breast-feeding woman on psychotropics as well as protecting and caring for her infant.", 
    "11": "Twenty free-ranging guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in Chubut Province, Argentina, were immobilized for health evaluations. All but two animals appeared to be in good condition. Hematology, serum chemistry, and vitamin and mineral levels were measured, and feces were evaluated for parasites. Serology tests included bluetongue, brucellosis, bovine respiratory syncitial virus, bovine viral diarrhea/mucosal disease, equine herpesvirus 1, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Johne's disease (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), foot and mouth disease, leptospirosis (17 serovars), parainfluenza-3, and vesicular stomatitis. Blood samples from 20 domestic sheep (Ovis aries) maintained in the same reserve with the guanaco were also collected at the same time for serology tests. No guanaco had positive serologic tests. Sheep were found to have antibody titers to bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Johne's disease, leptospirosis, and parainfluenza-3. There was no apparent difference in external appearance or condition, or statistical difference in blood test values, between the animals that were positive or negative for parasite ova.", 
    "12": "1. Animal studies show that cardiac vagal tone can be modified by gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons acting at several sites in the central nervous system. The present study has attempted to determine whether similar control exists in humans by using midazolam, a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines exert their main actions on the central nervous system by interacting co-operatively at the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor. 2. Twenty patients took part in the study before undergoing cardiac catheterization. After resting for 20 min in a semi-supine position on a couch, ECG, blood pressure and respiration were recorded for 5-min periods with either controlled (fixed) or free respiration. During this time a baroreceptor sensitivity test was conducted. 3. Doses of 1 mg and 5 mg of midazolam were administered intravenously. 4. Five-minute segments of data, before and after midazolam, were subjected to power spectral and time-domain analysis. 5. Midazolam caused a decrease in the high-frequency and an increase in the low-frequency components of the power spectral density plot, and in addition reduced the mean R-R interval and R-R variability expressed as the interquartile difference, and pNN50. There were no significant changes in the sensitivity of the baroreflex or in the systolic, diastolic and average blood pressures. 6. This decrease in variability of heart period, particularly at a controlled respiratory frequency, strongly suggests that cardiac vagal tone in man can be regulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons.", 
    "13": "Epileptic patients on long-term therapy with a single anticonvulsant showed enhanced expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (pBZrs) on neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced chemotaxis was significantly impaired in neutrophils from patients on carbamazepine (p < 0.01 vs. controls). Neutrophils from patients on phenytoin had enhanced phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated O-2 production (p < 0. 01 vs. controls) and neutrophils from patients on valproic acid had impaired phagocytosis frequency and Staphylococcus aureus lethality index (p < 0.01 vs. controls). Overexpression of pBZrs on leukocytes may reflect the clinical response to anticonvulsants and may play a role in the immunological effects of some of these drugs.", 
    "14": "Olanzapine is a recently introduced atypical neuroleptic agent for which little information is available on its use in children. Open clinical trials of olanzapine treatment were conducted on five hospitalized children (ages 6 to 11 years) with varying diagnoses including bipolar disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. Each patient had failed previous psychotropic medication trials, with a mean of four prior trials. The mean length of olanzapine treatment was 32 days (range, 2 to 7 weeks), and mean daily dose was 7.5 mg/day (range, 2.5 to 1.0 mg/day) or 0.22 mg/kg/day (range, 0.12 to 0.29 mg/kg/day). All children experienced adverse effects, including sedation (N = 3), weight gain of up to 16 pounds (N = 3), and akathisia (N = 2). Three patients showed some clinical improvement, but olanzapine treatment was discontinued in all five children within the first 6 weeks of treatment because of adverse effects or lack of clinically significant therapeutic response, although higher (or lower) doses, slower titration of dosage, or a longer duration of treatment might have produced more favorable results. Psychotic symptoms did not respond in the two patients with evidence of overt hallucinations and paranoid ideation. Improvement was observed in sleep in all five patients and in control of aggression in three. Before controlled trials of olanzapine in children are undertaken, further exploration of dose range and increased duration of treatment on an open basis are warranted. Until more encouraging data are available, clinicians should be cautious and conservative in their predictions about the potential value of olanzapine in treating preadolescent psychiatric disorders.", 
    "15": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed for the analysis of several benzodiazepines and some of their metabolites in blood, plasma and urine. The method included a liquid-liquid extraction with n-hexane:ethylacetate, a gradient elution on a C8 reversed phase column with a non-electrolyte eluent and a photo diode array detection. This allowed a rapid detection, a purity check, and identification as well as quantitation of the eluting peaks. The detection limit was 10 to 30 ng and the limit of quantitation was 0.05 microgram/mL, using 1 mL of blood, plasma or urine. The procedure is applied routinely in forensic toxicological analyses involving blood, stomach content, urine and organ samples. About 30 positive cases are reported. The avoidance of the use of an electrolyte buffer in the eluent resulted in a robust procedure, free of technical problems and of long rinsing periods, suitable for routine use in forensic toxicology analysis involving blood, urine, stomach content and tissue samples.",

The existing literature suggests fairly good efficacy of both typical and atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of psychotic disorders in children and adolescents. However, the incidence of certain side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). is found to be higher in younger patients compared with adults. Positron emission tomography (PET) receptor studies in adults have demonstrated that the incidence of EPS is related to dose-dependent dopamine type-2 (D2) receptor occupancy and that there is a significant relationship between the number of these receptors and age.",

    "21": "On day 1, 16 volunteers (eight men and eight women; age range, 20 to 40 years; weight range, 45 to 100 kg) received simultaneous doses of midazolam intravenously (0.05 mg/kg over 30 minutes) and orally (4 mg of a stable isotope, 15N3-midazolam). Starting on day 2, 500 mg clarithromycin was administered orally twice daily for 7 days. On day 8, intravenous and oral doses of midazolam were administered 2 hours after the final clarithromycin dose. Blood and urine samples were assayed for midazolam, 15N3-midazolam, and metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.", 
    "22": "There was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in the urinary excretion of 1'-hydroxymidazolam after intravenous and oral dosing on day 1 or day 8, indicating that the oral dose was completely absorbed into the gut wall. The oral clearance of midazolam was found to be significantly greater in female subjects (1.9 +/- 1.0 versus 1.0 +/- 0.3 L/hr/kg; p < 0.05) than in male subjects but not systemic clearance (0.35 +/- 0.1 versus 0.44 +/- 0.1 L/hr/kg). For women not receiving oral contraceptives (n = 6) a significant gender-related difference was observed for systemic and oral clearance and for area under the curve and elimination half-life after oral administration. A significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the systemic clearance of midazolam from 28 +/- 9 L/hr to 10 +/- 3 L/hr occurred after clarithromycin administration. Oral midazolam availability was significantly increased from 0.31 +/- 0.1 to 0.75 +/- 0.2 after clarithromycin dosing. Likewise, intestinal and oral availability were significantly increased from 0.42 +/- 0.2 to 0.83 +/- 0.2 and from 0.74 +/- 0.1 to 0.90 +/- 0.04, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between intestinal and oral availability (n = 32, r = 0.98, p < 0.05). After clarithromycin administration, a significant correlation was observed between the initial hepatic or intestinal availability and the relative increase in hepatic or intestinal availability, respectively. Female subjects exhibited a greater extent of interaction after oral and intravenous dosing than male subjects (p < 0.05).", 
    "23": "These data indicate that in addition to the liver, the intestine is a major site of the interaction between oral midazolam and clarithromycin. Interindividual variability in first-pass extraction of high-affinity CYP3A substrates such as midazolam is primarily a function of intestinal enzyme activity.",

    "33": "The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron, MDL 72222 and granisetron (0.01-1 microM), produced a concentration-dependent increase of K+-evoked [3H]ACh efflux in slices from rat entorhinal cortex preloaded with [3H]choline. Bicuculline and flumazenil, antagonists at different sites of the GABAA receptor, also enhanced [3H]ACh efflux. While the ACh releasing effect of ondansetron was markedly potentiated, in a TTX-sensitive manner, by bicuculline, the effects of MDL 72222 and granisetron were not significantly modified. A qualitatively identical interaction was found by using flumazenil, a GABAA antagonist at the benzodiazepine recognition site, in combination with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The potentiation by the GABAA antagonists of [3H]ACh efflux was also observed in a superfusion medium deficient in Cl-. The nonspecific K+-channel blockers TEA and Ba2+ also increased K+-evoked [3H]ACh efflux in this preparation but the releasing effect was not modified by bicuculline. The results support the functional interaction of ondansetron with GABAergic interneurons in the rat entorhinal cortex, GABA-independent mechanisms may however be involved in the regulation of cortical cholinergic function by other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.", 
    "34": "The GABAA receptor is a ligand-gated chloride channel belonging to the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels of which the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor is prototypic. In the central nervous system the GABAA receptor mediates fast neuronal inhibition. To facilitate the study of this receptor, a GABAA receptor-green fluorescent protein (GABAAR-GFP) chimera was constructed by fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus region of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, this chimera responded in a manner indistinguishable from the wild-type GABAA receptor with respect to agonist potency, receptor desensitization, allosteric modulation, rectification, and ion selectivity of the channel. The addition of GFP to the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit did not appear to alter the assembly or efficiency of expression of the GABAA receptor complex. The GABAAR-GFP chimera generated a strong fluorescent signal that was restricted to the animal pole of the oocyte plasma membrane. This signal was readily detectable using either epifluorescence or laser confocal microscopy. To confirm the extracellular location of the GFP portion of the chimera, non-permeabilized oocytes were immunolabeled with an anti-GFP antibody. Fluorescence microscopy showed that GFP was located extracellularly since it was accessible to the GFP antibody. These results confirm the predicted extracellular location of the C-terminus of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit and also demonstrate that GFP retains its fluorescent property when expressed extracellularly. The usefulness of the GABAAR-GFP chimera in receptor trafficking was investigated using non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues since GTP binding proteins participate in protein transport in oocytes. Microinjections of GTP-gamma-S but not GDP-beta-S reduced both GABA-gated chloride currents and cell surface GFP fluorescence in oocytes expressing the GABAAR-GFP chimera indicating that the chimera undergoes internalization upon stimulation of oocyte GTP-binding proteins. The results of the present study show that the GABAAR-GFP chimera is functionally similar to the wild-type GABAA receptor and can be used to study receptor trafficking in living cells. This is the first demonstration of a ligand-gated ion channel-GFP chimera for an ion channel belonging to this superfamily and also is the first example of the fusion of GFP to an extracellular domain of an integral membrane protein.", 
    "35": "Treatment of opiate addiction is generally directed at the suppression of withdrawal symptoms through maintenance of the 'addicted' state with methadone. Yet relatively little is known regarding the neural substrates that contribute to, and maintain the prolonged state of withdrawal experienced by addicts. Opiates can profoundly alter the dynamics of brain and peripheral cholinergic systems, and central administration of anticholinergic drugs in dependent rats has been shown to decrease the expression of precipitated withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the adaptive changes to M2 muscarinic receptors in autonomic centers are linked to the expression of withdrawal phenomena. During the peak period of withdrawal, there was a significant increase in both the expression of M2 muscarinic receptors and its corresponding mRNA within the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a primary vasomotor region. That most of these changes in receptor expression were adaptive in nature was suggested by the fact that when the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor DFP was co-administered with morphine, both the increased mRNA expression and the appearance of withdrawal symptoms were inhibited. Thus, interference with morphine-induced M2 muscarinic receptor adaptation in critical brain regions was correlated with a reduction in the development of physical dependence.", 
    "36": "GABA[A] receptors in the brain convert binding of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) to inhibition by chloride currents. Several important classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines and alcohol, modulate these receptors, which have also been implicated in epilepsy. We describe the alpha5 subunit of GABAA receptors in mice, comparing inbred DBA/2J mice, prone to juvenile audiogenic seizures, with seizure resistant C57BL/6J mice. We find no sequence differences between the strains, although there are several interesting amino acid differences from the rat. We also compare the expression of the alpha5 subunit in whole brains of DBA/2J mice to that in C57BL/6J mice at 21 days, the peak of the former's seizure susceptibility, again finding no significant difference. We further describe the pattern of expression of alpha5 mRNA during mouse brain development, with a peak at 3 days after birth, and among five brain regions in the adult mouse, with the highest levels in the hippocampus. Finally, we present preliminary evidence for rare alternative splicing of this subunit's message, in the N-terminal extracellular domain, to give a form not translatable into a functional protein.", 
    "37": "The purpose of the investigation was to assess the effects of desflurane (DES) on left ventricular heart function during basal barbiturate anesthesia in a closed-pericardium, closed-chest acute swine model. The study was performed in 11 normoventilated adult pigs. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained using arterial, central venous, and pulmonary artery catheters, as well as a conductance volumetry and tip manometry catheter placed in the left ventricle. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded during basal pentobarbital anesthesia and with the addition of 1%, 2%, 4%, and 6% DES. DES dose-dependently decreased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular end-systolic pressure, dP/dtMAX and dP/dtMIN. At doses >1%, decreases in CO, stroke volume, ejection fraction, end-systolic elastance, preload recruitable stroke work, preload adjusted maximal power, and peak filling rate were observed. Heart rate decreased at 4% and 6% DES. Isovolumetric relaxation time increased only at 6% DES. We conclude that smaller doses of DES have a significant cardiodepressive effect in the setting of barbiturate infusion, as measured by conductance volumetry.",

Drug discontinuation followed a 28-day treatment period with either 7.5 mg zopiclone, 0.25 mg triazolam, 1.0 mg flunitrazepam, or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study in private practice. Deterioration below individual pretreatment values (no-pill baseline) in at least one of three subjective parameters of sleep quality (sleep latency, total sleep time, nocturnal awakenings) and three parameters of daytime well-being (morning freshness, daytime tiredness, anxiety) were defined as rebound. The number of patients with rebound (rebound rate) was analyzed for every day of a 2-week posttreatment period. The overall rebound rate was higher in the placebo group (p < or = 0.001) than in each group treated with active drugs. Rebound rates affecting sleep quality were higher for placebo than for zopiclone (p < or = 0.001) and for flunitrazepam (p < or = 0.05). Rebound rates were smaller for zopiclone (p < or = 0.001) and flunitrazepam (p < or = 0.01) than for triazolam. Rebound in at least one item per day appeared in 21.5% (sleep quality) and 25.5% (daytime well-being) of the patients. Rebound decreased with increasing numbers of items of sleep quality or daytime well-being. Patients who did not respond to treatment showed higher rebound rates than those who were treatment responders (p < or = 0.001). Concerning treatment nonresponders, highest rebound was seen in the placebo group, whereas rebound was lowest in placebo responders. These results show that pill discontinuation itself may worsen sleep and daytime well-being in the sense of a rebound phenomenon. Furthermore, the number of patients with rebound remained at a high and varying level during the whole posttreatment period. This result indicates that a deterioration of sleep after drug withdrawal is not apparent during a few days but may last for longer periods in some patients and is modified by marked night-to-night variations.", 
    "40": "Relatively little is known about the sexual side-effects of psychotropic drugs, probably due to the taboos surrounding discussion of sexual matters. However, there is a growing interest in this topic. The antidepressants are probably the most widely studied class of psychotropic drug and evidence suggests that all commonly used classes are associated with some sexual side-effects. However, there may well be differences between the effects of different drugs in the same class. The study of sexual side-effects in bipolar patients taking mood stabilizers is complicated by the existence of numerous confounding variables and only limited data are currently available on the sexual side-effects of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. It is also important to take into account a number of methodological considerations when interpreting data on the sexual side-effects of psychotropic drugs.", 
    "41": "This study was designed to identify the mechanisms underlying the reduction in food intake in rats. Measurements were made of the release of cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulated by potassium chloride in the hypothalamus after (a) gamma irradiation (60Co), (b) treatment with the CCK-A and CCK-B antagonists L-364,718 and L-365,260 with and without radiation, (c) bilateral abdominal vagotomy, and (d) vagotomy with and without radiation and with and without L-364,718. The concentrations of CCK in hypothalamus perfusate were measured by a radioimmunoassay. Exposure of rats to 1, 3, 5 and 10 Gy (1 Gy/min) increased release of CCK in the hypothalamus in a manner that was dependent on dose. A dose of 5 Gy was chosen for further studies. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10, 20 and 50 microg/kg of L-364,718 did not induce significant changes in release of CCK in sham-irradiated animals. However, the drug decreased the release of CCK induced by radiation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to L-364,718, 20-50 microg/kg of L-365,260 decreased the release of CCK in the hypothalamus in sham-irradiated animals but did not decrease release of CCK induced by exposure to radiation. Vagotomy produced an insignificant reduction in release of CCK compared to that in sham-irradiated controls. However, vagotomy decreased release of CCK in irradiated rats compared to the irradiated rats without vagotomy. Vagotomy and i.p. administration of 10, 20 and 50 microg/kg of L-364,718 decreased release of CCK in irradiated rats compared to that in irradiated rats without vagotomy. However, i.p. administration of 10, 20 and 50 microg/kg of L-364,718 did not induce significant decreases in release of CCK in the hypothalamus of vagotomized and irradiated animals compared to those in rats that were vagotomized and irradiated but not treated with L-364,718. These results demonstrate that radiation increases the release of CCK in the hypothalamus, and that this effect is inhibited by vagotomy and the administration of a CCK-A receptor antagonist. A CCK-A receptor antagonist may be used to mitigate a radiation-induced deficit in food intake.", 
    "42": "Ten ferrets were used in a crossover study to determine the sedative effects of intramuscularly administered diazepam (3 mg/kg body weight)-butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg body weight)-ketamine (15 mg/kg body weight); acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg body weight)-butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg body weight)-ketamine (15 mg/kg body weight); and xylazine (2 mg/kg body weight)-butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg body weight)-ketamine (15 mg/kg body weight). All of the ferrets became laterally recumbent following the administration of each drug combination. The xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine combination induced significantly longer (p less than 0.05) durations of tail-clamp analgesia (mean+/-standard deviation [SD], 81.0+/-19.1 min versus 20.5+/-25.4 min and 30.0+/-26.9 min), dorsal recumbency (mean+/-SD, 94.6+/-13.6 min versus 75. 6+/-34.7 min and 55.2+24.8 min), and muscle relaxation suitable for endotracheal intubation (mean+/-SD, 67.1+/-23.0 min versus 7.0+/-22.1 min and 9.5+/-15.4 min) than the diazepam-butorphanol-ketamine and acepromazine-butorphanol-ketamine combinations, respectively. The recovery time from dorsal recumbency to standing was not significantly different among the three treatment groups. The heart rate was significantly lower in the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine group; however, systolic blood pressure was not significantly different among the treatment groups. Ventilatory function was more depressed in the diazepam-butorphanol-ketamine and xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine groups than in the acepromazine-butorphanol-ketamine group. A period (approximately 45 minutes) of hypoxia was observed in the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine-treated ferret. Of the three combinations evaluated in ferrets, xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine was concluded to be the most effective anesthetic combination. However, hypoxemia and ventricular arrhythmias were observed in the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine-treated ferrets, so the effectiveness of the xylazine-butorphanol-ketamine combination should be weighed against its cardiorespiratory side effects.", 
    "43": "The effects of three benzodiazepines on human aggressive behavior were examined in 44 medically healthy men. Volunteers were administered either placebo, 10 mg diazepam, 15 mg chlorazepate, or 50 mg oxazepam orally using double-blind procedures. Approximately 90 min after drug ingestion, participants were given the opportunity to administer electric shocks to an increasingly provocative fictitious opponent during a competitive reaction-time task. Aggression was defined as the level of shock the participant was willing to administer to the opponent. Results support the notion that diazepam (but not all benzodiazepines) can elicit aggressive behavior under controlled, laboratory conditions. Implications regarding the clinical use of various benzodiazepines for the tranquilization of potentially assaultive patients are discussed.", 
    "44": "The long isoform of the rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) was modified by the addition of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) epitope tag and green fluorescent protein (GFP). VSV-TRHR-GFP bound TRH with affinity similar to that of the unmodified receptor and stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate production. A clone stably expressing VSV-TRHR-GFP at some 120,000 copies/cell was selected to visualize this receptor during cellular exposure to TRH. Internalization was detected within 3-5 min after treatment with 1 x 10(-7) M TRH, with dramatic reductions in plasma membrane localization achieved within 10-15 min. The TRHR antagonist/inverse agonist chlordiazepoxide competitively inhibited internalization. Hyperosmotic sucrose inhibited internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP, measured both by intact cell [3H]TRH binding studies and by confocal microscopy. Now TRH caused a redistribution of VSV-TRHR-GFP to highly punctate but plasma membrane-delineated foci. Pretreatment with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole allowed internalization of the VSV-TRHR-GFP construct but only into vesicles that remained in close apposition to the plasma membrane. Covisualization of VSV-TRHR-GFP and Texas Red transferrin initially indicated entirely separate localizations. After exposure to TRH substantial amounts of VSV-TRHR-GFP were present in vesicles overlapping those containing Texas Red transferrin. Such results demonstrate the G protein-coupling capacity and provide real time visualization of the processes of internalization of a TRH-receptor-GFP construct in response to agonist.",

Secondary outcome measures included ICU and hospital lengths of stay, hospital mortality, and acquired organ system derangements. A total of 93 (38.4%) mechanically ventilated patients received continuous i.v. sedation while 149 (61.6%) patients received either bolus administration of i.v. sedation (n=64) or no i.v. sedation (n=85) following intubation. The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer for patients receiving continuous i.v. sedation compared with patients not receiving continuous i.v. sedation (185+/-190 h vs 55.6+/-75.6 h; p<0.001). Similarly, the lengths of intensive care (13.5+/-33.7 days vs 4.8+/-4.1 days; p<0.001) and hospitalization (21.0+/-25.1 days vs 12.8+/-14.1 days; p<0.001) were statistically longer among patients receiving continuous i.v. sedation. Multiple linear regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender, severity of illness, mortality, indication for mechanical ventilation, use of chemical paralysis, presence of a tracheostomy, and the number of acquired organ system derangements, found the adjusted duration of mechanical ventilation to be significantly longer for patients receiving continuous i.v. sedation compared with patients who did not receive continuous i.v. sedation (148 h [95% confidence interval: 121, 175 h] vs 78.7 h [95% confidence interval: 68.9, 88.6 h]; p<0.001).", 
    "51": "We conclude from these preliminary observational data that the use of continuous i.v. sedation may be associated with the prolongation of mechanical ventilation. This study suggests that strategies targeted at reducing the use of continuous i.v. sedation could shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation for some patients. Prospective randomized clinical trials, using well-designed sedation guidelines and protocols, are required to determine whether patient-specific outcomes (eg, duration of mechanical ventilation, patient comfort) can be improved compared with conventional sedation practices.", 
    "52": "The jet injector route for midazolam was used in 40 children 1 - 6 years of age undergoing various short duration surgical procedures. A randomly selected dose of 100, 150, and 200 microg/kg was given by a jet injector and compared to 80 microg/kg by conventional i.m. injection with syringe and needle to induce sedation/anesthesia. Because of clinical limitations, plasma midazolam levels were measured for only up to 32 min post-injection. Peak levels were 70.4, 105.8, 157.3, and 135.5 ng/ml in the corresponding groups. Plasma levels reached their peak faster after 200 microg/kg jet injection than after 80microg/kg i.m. midazolam. Furthermore, midazolam plasma levels were sustained longer after 200 microg/kg by jet injection. Larger doses of midazolam are required by jet injection than by i.m. injection. Individual subjects showed considerable variability in plasma levels of midazolam by both methods of administration, although jet injection was more convenient and less traumatic.", 
    "53": "The protective and adverse effect potentials of levetiracetam ((S)-alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidine acetamide) in rodent models of seizures and epilepsy were compared with the profile of several currently prescribed and newly developed antiepileptic drugs. Levetiracetam was devoid of anticonvulsant activity in the acute maximal electroshock seizure test and in the maximal pentylenetetrazol seizure test in mice (up to 540 mg/kg, i.p.) but exhibited potent protection against generalised epileptic seizures in electrically and pentylenetetrazol-kindled mice (ED50 values = 7 and 36 mg/kg, respectively, i.p.). This differs markedly from established and most new antiepileptic drugs which induce significant protection in both the acute seizure tests and the kindling models. Furthermore, levetiracetam was devoid of anticonvulsant activity in several maximal chemoconvulsive seizure tests although an interesting exception was the potent protection observed against secondarily generalised activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine in mice (ED50 value = 7 mg/kg, i.p.), pilocarpine and kainic acid in rats (minimum active dose = 17 and 54 mg/kg, respectively, i.p.). The protection afforded by levetiracetam on the threshold for methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)-induced seizures persisted after chronic administration (17-170 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily/14 days) and levetiracetam did not lower the seizure threshold for the proconvulsant action of the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142). The main metabolite of levetiracetam (ucb L057; (S)-alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetic acid) was found to be inactive in sound-sensitive mice after acute administration of doses up to 548 mg/kg, i.p. Levetiracetam induced only minor behavioural alterations in both normal and amygdala-kindled rats (54-1700 mg/kg, i.p.) resulting in an unusually high safety margin between rotarod impairment and seizure suppression of 148 in corneally kindled mice and 235 in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg. In comparison, existing antiepileptic drugs have ratios between 2 and 17 in the corneally kindled mouse model. These studies reveal a unique profile of levetiracetam in rodent models. Characteristics are a general lack of anticonvulsant activity against maximal, acute seizures and selective protection with a very high safety margin in genetic and kindled animals and against chemoconvulsants producing partial epileptic seizures. This activity differs markedly from that of the established and newly introduced antiepileptic drugs and appears to derive from the parent compound since its major metabolite was inactive in all models studied. Together these results therefore suggest that levetiracetam may offer an effective, broad-spectrum treatment of epileptic seizures in patients, with a minimum of adverse effects.", 
    "54": "The pharmacological properties of benzodiazepine binding sites of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex from cortical, hippocampal and cerebellar membranes of Roman high-avoidance (RHA/Verh) and Roman low-avoidance (RLH/Verh) rats were investigated. No major differences between the two lines were found in the binding parameters of [3H]flunitrazepam (a non-selective agonist). [3 H]zolpidem (a Type I selective agonist) or [3 H]ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazol[1,5-a]-[1,4]benzodiazepine- 3-carboxylate (Ro15-4513) (a partial inverse agonist). Neither the Kd values nor the Bmax for these ligands differed between RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rats in any of the brain regions studied. As a result, the proportion of Type I binding sites in cortical and hippocampal membranes of RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rats or the 'diazepam-sensitive' and the 'diazepam-insensitive' binding sites in cerebellar membranes, calculated from the [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]zolpidem maximal binding sites or from [3H]Ro15-4513 binding (in the absence or in presence of diazepam), respectively, was also similar. Furthermore, there were no differences between the two rat lines in the allosteric interactions between GABA and the benzodiazepine binding sites (labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam) in all three areas tested or the Type I binding sites (labeled with [3H]zolpidem) in the hippocampus. In contrast, RLA/Verh rats showed a significant reduction in the allosteric interactions between GABA and [3H]zolpidem binding sites in the cortex. As a whole, these results indicate the absence of generalized between-line differences in the GABA(A) receptor complex showing, at the same time, the existence of some specific differences in allosterism within the GABA(A) complex. These differences may contribute to the divergent emotional responses which characterize the RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rat lines.",

Polyclonal antibodies vs. the CCKBRs were raised in chicken, and immunohistochemistry on tissue sections was used to localize the receptor within the organ.

The medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and several control tissues such as liver and muscle were negative. Displacement experiments using [125I]-BH-CCK and various agonists and antagonists identified binding sites with typical CCKBR pharmacology. CCKBRs were localized in the proximal tubulus, distal collecting ducts and mesangium cells.

All five patients presented with classic signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity, which included tachycardia, hot, dry and flushed skin, markedly dilated and fixed pupils, and pronounced delirium. The patients were violently agitated, and physical restraint was required. Initial treatment with benzodiazepines did not diminish their combative behavior. Treatment with intravenous physostigmine salicylate resulted in a decrease in agitation within 15 to 20 minutes of therapy.

    "60": "This study was a 13-month prospective, descriptive case series of risperidone overdose reported by telephone to a regional poison control center (PCC) serving Philadelphia, PA. Patients were seen in local Philadelphia-area emergency departments. The variables examined were medical history, therapeutic use of risperidone, time postingestion, reported coingestants, clinical findings, decontamination and treatment, electrocardiograph results, laboratory data, standard toxicologic screen results, and length of time in hospital. Thirty-one patients (29 adult/adolescent, 2 pediatric) with reported risperidone overdose were identified. Risperidone was the sole ingestant in 15 cases (1 mg to 180 mg). The major observed effects in this group included lethargy (7), spasm/dystonia (3), hypotension (2), tachycardia (6), and dysrhythmia (1). Sixteen cases involved coingestants, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, ethanol, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, anticonvulsants, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen, and anticholinergic agents. Major effects in these patients included lethargy (10), coma (1), seizure (1), tachycardia (7), bradycardia (1), hypotension (4), and a syndrome of muscle spasms, diaphoresis, and fever. Treatment provided for patients in this study included antiarrhythmics (1), diphenhydramine (2), anticonvulsant (1), vasopressor agent (1), endotracheal intubation/assisted ventilation (5), and supportive care. One patient who coingested imipramine died of medical complications. In the remaining patients, symptoms resolved with 24 hours in the majority, with all patients asymptomatic at 72 hours postingestion. These data show that risperidone toxicity manifests primarily as mild central nervous system effects and reversible neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects.", 
    "61": "Sprague-Dawley (Rattus norvegicus) rats were trained in a drug discrimination task using the state-dependent interoceptive stimulus attributes of cocaine's delayed or rebound effects (CDE) versus \"normal\" basal homeostasis. Rats were injected with either 32 mg/kg cocaine or equivalent volumes of saline (SAL), subcutaneously, 13 hr before the sessions. Rats demonstrated > 90% discriminative accuracy. Test sessions showed a time-dependent acute cocaine isodirectional rebound state that engendered a shift from predominantly SAL- to CDE-appropriate responding approximately 7 hr after the high training dose injection and lasted for approximately 10 hr (17 hr postinjection). The delayed or rebound state was dose dependent and engendered only a biphasic partial generalization with acute cocaine injections. There were no detectable levels of cocaine or any of its behaviorally active metabolites at the 13-hr postinjection interval. Tests conducted with various doses of lidocaine, chlordiazepoxide, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, ketamine, and buspirone engendered SAL- or default-appropriate responding. The anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, produced partial generalization to the cocaine rebound cue.", 
    "62": "It was tested whether a depletion in resources can account for the benzodiazepine-induced memory impairment. In two experiments, it was examined whether dividing attention had a disproportionately detrimental effect on learning semantically related and unrelated word pairs after diazepam intake. Word pairs had to be learned in both a single task condition and while performing a visual discrimination task concurrently (dual task condition). Moreover, the complexity of the visual discrimination task was manipulated systematically. Diazepam (15 mg, orally) or placebo was administered in a double-blind, between-subjects design. Subjects after diazepam intake were clearly impaired in learning unrelated word pairs, but not in learning related word pairs. Dividing attention in the dual task condition was associated with a reduction in learning unrelated word pairs, but this was not disproportionately reduced after diazepam intake. Moreover, the magnitude of resource depletion did not correlate with the severity of the diazepam-induced memory impairment. In general, the pattern of results does not support the hypothesis that a depletion of resources can explain the benzodiazepine-induced memory impairment.", 
    "63": "Until recently, research indicated that all benzodiazepines impair explicit memory, while only lorazepam impairs priming. Stewart and associates provided preliminary data which indicated that both oxazepam and lorazepam may impair implicit memory, but in a time-dependent fashion. The present study was designed to replicate Stewart et al.'s findings after overcoming several limitations of the original study. Thirty subjects were administered an acute dose of lorazepam (2 mg), oxazepam (30 mg) or a placebo and were tested with an implicit (word-stem completion) test and an explicit (cued recall) test. However, subjects were only tested at 170 min post-drug (close to oxazepam's theoretical peak concentration) to rule out the possible \"explicit memory contamination\" explanation of the Stewart et al. implicit memory findings. Consistent with previous research, both drugs impaired explicit memory relative to placebo. Also, both lorazepam and oxazepam impaired priming performance, supporting the \"time-dependence\" interpretation of the Stewart et al. findings. The results also indicate that episodic memory is impaired by both benzodiazepines in a time-dependent fashion even when the research methodology used involves everyday memory demands.", 
    "64": "Two experiments were designed to test whether the memory impairment induced by benzodiazepines (BZDs) is due to impaired memory for temporal context. In both experiments, subjects were administered either diazepam (15 mg oral) or placebo, and a standard BZD impairment on prose recall as well as a decreased subjective arousal was found. Key tasks to explore temporal context memory were an A-B A-C proactive interference paradigm and a list discrimination task. Initial learning of both groups on these tasks was broadly matched. In experiment 1, diazepam did not increase susceptibility to proactive interference using semantically related words. However, in experiment 2, using unrelated word pairs, diazepam markedly increased the number of prior list intrusions. Furthermore, after diazepam intake, subjects were clearly impaired in learning unrelated word pairs. Subjects after diazepam intake were not impaired in the list discrimination task. We conclude that (1) diazepam impairs the forming of new associations, whether this is the formation of links between two or more targets or between targets and context, (2) a temporal context encoding deficit cannot account for a broader diazepam-induced memory impairment.", 
    "65": "We tested the effects of lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg and diazepam 0.3 mg/kg on the identification of pictures of everyday objects that were specifically modified to examine the role of different parts of the external contour. By pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard, observers could add 1% of the total contour of each picture until it was recognized. Identification thresholds were measured in three display conditions, depending on where along the contour the addition of contour pixels started. In the minima condition, stimuli were initially displayed with only minima (i.e., locations along the contour where negative curvature is strongest); all parts with negative curvature were then built up gradually from the minima and only later on were the fragments with positive curvature shown until the contour became closed at the maxima (i.e., locations where positive curvature is strongest). In the maxima condition, initially only the maxima were displayed, with all positive contour built up first and then the negative curvature until the minima were reached. In the inflections condition, the points along the contour shown first were inflections (i.e., points where curvature is locally zero because the sign of curvature changes there) and contour was built up by adding parts of positive and negative curvature at both sides of each inflection until the extrema (minima and maxima) were reached to close the contour of the picture. In general, picture identification was more difficult (i.e., a larger portion of the contour was required) in the minima condition than in the maxima and the inflections conditions. The diazepam group did not differ significantly from the placebo group, while the lorazepam group had significantly lower performance in all three display conditions. Results are discussed in relation to previous research showing impaired perceptual integration and impaired implicit memory under lorazepam influence.", 
    "66": "The effects of lorazepam (0.026 or 0.038 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine, and of a placebo on metamemory, i.e. knowledge about one's own memory capabilities, were investigated in 36 healthy volunteers. Accuracy of confidence levels (CL) in the correctness of recalled answers and accuracy of feeling of knowing (FOK) the answers when recall fails were measured using a sentence memory task assessing episodic memory and a task consisting of general information questions and assessing semantic memory. Lorazepam impaired episodic memory. Unexpectedly, it also impaired performance in both the recall and recognition phases of the task assessing semantic memory, suggesting that it decreased the ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect information. In episodic memory, lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg-treated subjects exhibited an impaired CL accuracy, compared to placebo-treated subjects, and their FOK accuracy was at chance. In semantic memory, their overall CL and FOK accuracy was apparently spared. However, these subjects selectively overestimated their CL judgements for incorrect answers; moreover, secondary analyses showed that FOK accuracy for a subset of low-accuracy items was virtually nil. These results suggest that lorazepam impairs metamemory for both episodic and semantic memory.", 
    "67": "This study was designed to examine and contrast cognitive effects (explicit memory and access to semantic knowledge) of the benzodiazepine Halcion (triazolam) in ten normal volunteers and ten cognitively un-impaired detoxified alcoholics. The two groups were indistinguishable from one another under placebo conditions on all measures of cognitive functioning. Under Halcion test conditions (0.375 mg p.o.), both groups were about equally impaired in their recall of to-be-remembered information. However, alcoholics, were more likely to recall information that they were not asked to remember (intrusion errors) on all measures of explicit remembering. Alcoholics also generated relatively uncommon (low frequency) responses from semantic memory, rather than common, categorically related associations in response to stimuli such as types of vegetables, flowers, and fruit following the administration of Halcion, but were not different from normal volunteers in the types of responses generated under placebo conditions. These findings suggest that a drug challenge that simulates many of the effects of acute alcohol administration induces alcoholics to think and remember differently (qualitatively) from normal volunteers.", 
    "68": "The behavioural trait of impulsivity may be made up of different components, including rapid decision making, intolerance to the delay of reward and a tendency to terminate chains of responses prematurely. It has been proposed to measure the last of these in rats using fixed consecutive number (FCN) schedules. The present study uses a modified version of the FCN procedure in which responding was paced by retracting the response lever for short periods between presses. In this way, the experimenter could control the maximum rate of responding. The procedure was made up of two components based on an FCN 8 schedule of food reinforcement. In the Fast component, lever presses were spaced by a minimum of 2 s and in the Slow component by a minimum of 5 s. The average chain length was significantly shorter, and the rats were less efficient in the Slow component. Five drugs were tested on this baseline, imipramine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg), ethanol (300-3000 mg/kg administered PO), haloperidol (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide ( 1.0-10.0 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine (0.2-0.8 mg/kg). All the drugs reduced responding at the highest dose, but imipramine was different from the others in that it increased the average number of responses in the chain and produced a shift in the chain length distribution to the right, possibly reflecting a reduction in impulsivity. The other four drugs reduced chain length at the highest dose, although in the case of ethanol this effect was very small and, unlike the other three drugs, did not result in a shift in the distribution to the left. The paced FCN procedure can differentiate the effects of different drugs on one aspect of impulsivity, and is likely to be a useful procedure for further study of this aspect of behaviour.", 
    "69": "The effects of drugs on one aspect of impulsive behaviour were evaluated using a schedule in which rats were trained to complete a fixed consecutive number of responses on one of two levers before pressing the second to obtain a reinforcer (FCN). Terminating the chain before completing the FCN resulted in the omission of the food, and can be considered an impulsive decision. Two groups of food-deprived rats were trained to press either 8 or 32 times on the left lever (FCN lever) of a two lever operant chamber before pressing the right lever (Reinforcement lever) to deliver a food pellet. Responding on the Reinforcement lever before completion of the sequence resulted in a short time-out and the rat had to begin the sequence again. After responding had stabilised, the rats were treated with a range of doses of a number of drugs. Impulsivity was assessed by several measures, including the mean chain length and the proportion of chains terminating in food delivery, and the distribution of chain lengths was analysed. The efficiency of the rats was similar under both FCN 8 and FCN 32, although it was more difficult to maintain a consistent baseline under FCN 32. Under the FCN 8 schedule, significant decreases in chain length were obtained with d-amphetamine (0.8-2.4 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), ethanol (1 and 3 g/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (10.0 mg/kg), and there were alterations in other measures consistent with an increase in impulsivity. Imipramine (1-10 mg/kg), citalopram (1-10 mg/kg) and metergoline (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) had no effect on mean chain length, although the first two drugs shifted the chain length distribution to the left. d-Amphetamine (0.4-1.2 mg/kg) and PCPA (100 mg/kg) reduced chain length and had other effects consistent with increased impulsivity under FCN 32 schedule, whereas imipramine had little, and citalopram no, effect. Taken generally, effect of the active drugs was relatively non-specific, including both a reduction in response rate and alterations in choice measures proposed to reflect an increase in impulsivity. Detailed analysis of the effect of amphetamine revealed that three processes were at work: chain shortening, an increased preference for the lever most closely associated with food delivery, and a gradual shift in the control over responding from the response sequence (pattern) to the individual lever press (act).", 
    "70": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam and of its main metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam, were investigated in intensive care patients after intravenous bolus of 0.2 mg/kg followed by a 0.1 mg/kg/h intravenous infusion of midazolam over 2 hours. A wide interpatient variability of the main pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam was found. The mean values of elimination half life and volume of distribution, 4.5 +/- 5.4 h and 1.7 +/- 0.7 l/kg respectively, were higher than those reported in healthy subjects. Total plasma clearance was significantly increased in patients taking drugs that induce hepatic metabolism. Significant concentrations of the unconjugated form of 1-hydroxymidazolam were recovered in plasma. The volume of distribution and the elimination half life of the metabolite were higher than those of the parent drug. These results show that 1-hydroxymidazolam might contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect of midazolam and consequently must be taken into account during pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.", 
    "71": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine with short elimination half-life, used as induction or continuous agent for general anesthesia. At present, only injectable solution is available from French hospital pharmacies. The aim of the study is the development of 5 mg midazolam sublingual tablets to realize a short general anesthesia without intravenous or intramuscular injection. Incorporation of citric acid in the tablet formulation leads to an increase of dissolution rates of active drug, but a decrease of diffusion through lipid membranes is observed with 10 mg of citric acid when using the Dibbern's Resomat three phases apparatus. One explanation of this result is that midazolam (pKa = 6.1) in presence of 10 mg of citric acid is ionised. The ionised form, more hydrophilic, cannot cross the artificial lipid membrane and therefore the diffusion decreases. On the other hand, the decrease of diffusion's rate, when pH increases, is explained by the precipitation of midazolam at pH higher than 6. A compromise between dissolution and diffusion results leads us to choose the sublingual formulation containing 5 mg of citric acid per tablet.",

    "73": "We administered a vignette describing a female PD patient to 189 PCPs.", 
    "74": "Three-quarters of respondents believed that PD was at least 50 percent probable, and the mean PD likelihood rating was 63 percent. Diagnostic suspicion was significantly higher for PD than for other anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and cardiac disorders. Medication was rated as significantly more necessary than medical testing and mental health referral. A benzodiazepine was suggested by 78 percent of respondents, while 35 percent suggested a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI). Under half rated the patient as requiring medical testing, mostly for hyperthyroidism (70%) and/or cardiovascular disorder (62%), and half felt that the patient required mental health referral.", 
    "75": "The data suggest that most PCPs are able to recognize PD. However, they may be excessively inclined to prescribe benzodiazepines rather than more appropriate medications.", 
    "76": "We have created a pediatric sedation unit (PSU) in response to the need for uniform, safe, and appropriately monitored sedation and/or analgesia for children undergoing invasive and noninvasive studies or procedures in a large tertiary care medical center. The operational characteristics of the PSU are described in this report, as is our clinical experience in the first 8 months of operation.", 
    "77": "A retrospective review of quality assurance data was performed. These data included patient demographics and chronic medical diagnoses, procedure, or study performed; sedative or analgesic medication given; complications (defined prospectively); and sedation and monitoring time. Patient-specific medical records related to the procedure and sedation were reviewed if a complication was noted in the quality assurance data.", 
    "78": "Briefly, the PSU was staffed with an intensivist and pediatric intensive care unit nurses. Patients were admitted to the PSU and assessed medically for risk factors during sedation. Continuous heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry monitoring were used, and blood pressure was determined every 5 minutes. After sedation and stabilization, with monitoring continued, the patient was transported to the site to undergo the procedure or study. The pediatric intensive care unit nurse remained with the patient at all times. All necessary emergency equipment was transported with the patient. After the procedure or study was completed, the patient was returned to the PSU for recovery to predetermined parameters. We were able to analyze 458 episodes of sedation for this review. Procedures and studies included radiologic examinations, cardiac catheterization, orthopedic manipulations, solid organ and bone marrow biopsy, gastrointestinal endoscopy, bronchoscopy, evoked potential measurements, and others. Patients were 2 weeks to 32 years of age. The average time from initiation of sedation to last dose of medication administered was 84 minutes. The average time from initiation of sedation to full recovery was 120 minutes. Sedative and analgesia medications use was not standardized; however, the majority of children needing sedation received propofol or midazolam. For patients requiring analgesia, ketamine or fentanyl was added. In 79 of 458 (12%) sedation episodes, complications were documented. Mild hypotension (4.4%), pulse oximetry <93% (2.6%), apnea (1.5%), and transient airway obstruction (1.3%) were the most common complications noted. Cancellation of 11 (2.4%) procedures was attributable to complications. No long-term morbidity or mortality was seen.", 
    "79": "Many children require sedation or analgesia during procedures or studies. Safe sedation is best ensured by appropriate presedation risk assessment and with monitoring by a care provider trained in resuscitative measures who is not involved in performing the procedure itself. Uniformity of care in a large institution is a standard met by the creation of a centralized service, with active input from the department of anesthesiology. We present the PSU as a model for achieving these goals.", 
    "80": "The diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) is a 10-kDa highly evolutionarily conserved multifunctional protein. In mammals, one of DBI's functions is in the activation of steroid hormone biosynthesis via binding to a specific outer mitochondrial membrane receptor (benzodiazepine receptor, BZD) and promoting cholesterol transport to the inner membrane. In this work, a multitiered approach was utilized to study the role of this receptor-like activity in ecdysteroidogenesis by larval insect prothoracic glands (PGs). First, both DBI protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were correlated with peak PG ecdysteroid production. In vitro ecdysteroid production was stimulated by the diazepam analogue FGIN 1-27 and inhibited anti-DBI antibodies. The DBI protein was found distributed throughout PG cells, including regions of dense mitochondria, supposed subcellular sites of ecdysteroid synthesis. Finally, a potential mitochondrial BZD receptor in PG cells was demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling. These results suggest an important role for the insect DBI in the stimulation of steroidogenesis by prothoracic glands and indicate that a pathway for cholesterol mobilization leading to the production of steroid hormones appears to be conserved between arthropods and mammals.", 
    "81": "1. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of the novel non-peptide neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor antagonist, BIBP3226 (N2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxy-phenyl)methyl]-D-arginine amide) on spontaneous, fasting-induced and NPY-induced food intake in rats. In addition to consumption of regular chow, the effects of BIBP3226 on consumption of highly palatable sweetened mash were monitored in a 1 h test on first exposure and after familiarization with novel food. 2. BIBP3226 (10.0 nmol, i.c.v.) had no effect on the consumption of regular chow, but reduced significantly the intake of highly palatable diet and the food intake stimulated by fasting (24 h). Neuropeptide Y (NPY, 1.0 nmol, i.c.v.) significantly increased the consumption of regular rat chow. This orexigenic effect of NPY was blocked by BIBP3226 (10.0 nmol, administered i.c.v. 5 min before NPY) at 30 min and 4 h, but not at 1 and 2 h. When animals were pretreated with diazepam (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.p., 20 min before NPY), BIBP3226 failed to suppress NPY-induced feeding. 3. An NPY Y1 and Y3 receptor agonist, [Leu31,Pro34]NPY and a Y5 receptor agonist human peptide YY3-36 (hPYY3-36, both 30 pmol), microinjected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) increased the consumption of regular rat chow. BIBP3226 (0.4 nmol, into the PVN) completely blocked the stimulatory effect of [Leu31,Pro34]NPY but not that of hPYY3-36. BIBP3226 (0.4 nmol) alone failed to modify the consumption of the regular chow. Higher doses of BIBP3226 (1.0 and 2.0 nmol) injected into the vicinity of the PVN reduced the consumption of the sweetened mash. 4. These results suggest that both the NPY Y1 and Y5 receptors in the PVN are involved in the regulation of food intake. The stimulatory effect of exogenous NPY is probably mediated through an NPY receptor subtype that is not identical with the Y1 receptor (possibly Y5 receptor). However, the NPY Y1 receptors may mediate the effect of endogenous NPY in conditions of increased energy demand or on intake of highly palatable diets.", 
    "82": "Acute flunitrazepam (1 microM) exposure for 1 h reduced GABA(A) receptor alpha1 (22+/-4%, mean+/-s.e.mean) and beta2/3 (21+/-4%) subunit protein levels in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells. This rapid decrease in subunit proteins was completely prevented by bisindolymaleimide 1 (1 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C, but not by N-[2-((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89, 4.8 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinases A and G. These results suggest the existence of a benzodiazepine-induced mechanism to rapidly alter GABA(A) receptor protein expression, that appears to be dependent on protein kinase C activity.", 
    "83": "Male rats were exposed to noise for 6 running hours and the effects of pretreatment with the benzodiazepine diazepam on the adrenal gland were evaluated. Ultrastructural examination showed that, after noise exposure, zona reticularis cells resulted the more affected, exhibiting areas of diluted cytoplasm, disarranged endoplasmic reticulum, membrane vestigia and some altered mitochondria; diluted cytoplasmic areas appeared in noradrenaline-storing cells, too. On the contrary, zona reticularis cells from diazepam-pretreated and noise-exposed rats resulted significantly less altered, as well as the noradrenaline-storing cells. The present findings indicate that diazepam is able to exert some protective action on adrenal gland alterations due to noise exposure.", 
    "84": "1. Changes in the plasma cortisol level were reported in a male patient with panic disorder during the period of low-dose alprazolam treatment (mean 0.62 +/- 0.15 mg/day) compared with during the period of high-dose period (mean 1.08 +/- 0.28 mg/day). 2. The plasma cortisol level was significantly higher in the low-dose period (mean 13.90 +/- 3.35 micrograms/ml) than in the high-dose period (mean 9.06 +/- 2.75 micrograms/ml) although, paradoxically, the panic attack frequency was significantly lower in the low-dose period (mean 1.35 +/- 0.29/day) than in the high-dose period (mean 2.09 +/- 0.66/day). 3. Thus, the decreased plasma cortisol level during alprazolam treatment of panic disorder was suggested to be caused not by symptom alleviation due to alprazolam but by alprazolam administration itself.",

    "89": "This study examined gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) receptor function in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells by using microphysiometry following chronic flunitrazepam exposure, and correlated the findings with the alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit protein expression and [3H]muscimol binding after the same treatment paradigm. Flunitrazepam treatment reduced (p < 0.05) the maximal GABA-stimulated increase in extracellular acidification rate (Emax) (16.5 +/- 1.2% and 11.3 +/- 1.0%, 2-day control and treated cells, respectively; 17.4 +/- 1.0% and 9.9 +/- 0.7%, 7-day control and treated cells, respectively; best-fit Emax +/- SEM, n = 7), without affecting the GABA concentration required to elicit 50% of maximal response (EC50) (1.2 +/- 1.7 and 2.3 +/- 1.8 microM, 2-day control and treated cells, respectively; 1.7 +/- 1.5 and 1.5 +/- 1.5 microM, 7-day control and treated cells, respectively; best-fit EC50 +/- SEM, n = 7). Flunitrazepam exposure also abolished the flunitrazepam potentiation of the GABA response, caused a transient reduction of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit proteins over the initial 2 days, but did not alter [3H]muscimol binding compared with vehicle-treated cells. The results suggest that changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit protein expression, rather than loss of [3H]muscimol binding sites, underlie the chronic flunitrazepam-mediated desensitisation of GABA(A) receptor function.", 
    "90": "Increasing extracellular pH from 7.4 to 8.5 caused a dramatic increase in the time required to recover from a glutamate (3 microM, for 15 s)-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in indo-1-loaded cultured cortical neurons. Recovery time in pH 7.4 HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS) was 126 +/- 30 s, whereas recovery time was 216 +/- 19 s when the pH was increased to 8.5. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ did not inhibit the prolongation of recovery caused by increasing pH. Extracellular alkalinization caused rapid intracellular alkalinization following glutamate exposure, suggesting that pH 8.5 HBSS may delay Ca2+ recovery by affecting intraneuronal Ca2+ buffering mechanisms, rather than an exclusively extracellular effect. The effect of pH 8.5 HBSS on Ca2+ recovery was similar to the effect of the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydrazone (FCCP; 750 nM). However, pH 8.5 HBSS did not have a quantitative effect on mitochondrial membrane potential comparable to that of FCCP in neurons loaded with a potential-sensitive fluorescent indicator, 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine++ + iodide (JC-1). We found that the effect of pH 8.5 HBSS on Ca2+ recovery was completely inhibited by the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor CGP-37157 (25 microM). This suggests that increased mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux via the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is responsible for the prolongation of [Ca2+]i recovery caused by alkaline pH following glutamate exposure.", 
    "91": "Acute administration of the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine (5 mg kg(-1 i.p.) increased the number of Fos-positive cells moderately in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum; more pronounced were the effects in the nucleus accumbens, the lateral septum, the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the amygdala. The acutely-induced Fos responses of olanzapine were significantly reduced in all brain areas investigated after a 3-week treatment period, indicating the development of tolerance. Through evaluation of cross-tolerance we investigated whether the effects of olanzapine, haloperidol and clozapine on Fos expression and on plasma corticosterone are mediated by the same or by different mechanisms. Cross-tolerance between olanzapine and either haloperidol or clozapine was assessed by the administration of a challenge dose of olanzapine to rats, that were pretreated for 3 weeks with either the same drug, with saline (1 ml kg(-1) day(-1), haloperidol (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1) or clozapine (20 mg kg(-1) day(-1). A competitive dose of olanzapine in long-term haloperidol-treated rats showed cross-tolerance in the rostral part of the cingulate cortex, the dorsomedial and the dorsolateral striatum, the nucleus accumbens and the lateral septum. Cross-tolerance between olanzapine and clozapine, however, was limited to limbic nuclei, including the prefrontal cortex, the lateral septum, the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the amygdala, with minor effects in the mid- and caudal parts of the cingulate cortex. Interesting are the common effects in the lateral septum, possibly an important target for antipsychotic efficacy. Olanzapine administration induced elevated levels of plasma corticosterone and cross-tolerance was seen in haloperidol- and clozapine-pretreated rats.", 
    "92": "The involvement of nitrergic mechanisms in the behavioural effects of diazepam in rats was studied in the elevated plus-maze, open-field and rotarod tests. Administration of the nitric oxide (NO) precursor L-arginine (100 mg/kg, i.p.), assumed to increase the synthesis of NO, abolished the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) in the elevated plus-maze, whereas the inactive enantiomer D-arginine (100 mg/kg) did not. Neither diazepam alone nor in combination with L- or D-arginine affected the exploratory activity of animals in the open field. Pretreatment with L-arginine (100 and 200 mg/kg) did not modify the motor impairment of rats after diazepam (3 mg/kg) in the rotarod test. Diazepam (2 mg/kg i.p.) did not inhibit the cortical or hippocampal cytosolic NO synthase activity measured ex vivo by [3H]L-arginine assay. Diazepam was similarly ineffective in in vitro studies at concentrations up to 10 microM. We conclude that a suppression of NO synthase activity may be important in the anxiolytic-like effect of benzodiazepines. However, diazepam does not inhibit NO synthase directly, but may affect NO synthase activity indirectly via some unknown mechanism.", 
    "93": "Honokiol, a neolignane derivative of Magnolia bark, has central depressant action and, at much lower doses, anxiolytic activity. We have investigated the characteristics of the behavioural effects of honokiol by means of an elevated plus-maze test. In the plus-maze test a single oral dose of 20 mg kg(-1) honokiol significantly prolonged the time spent in the open arms of the maze, suggesting anxiolytic effect. Moreover, when honokiol was administered daily for seven days and the plus-maze test was conducted 3 or 24 h after the last administration, significant prolongation of the time in the open arms was manifested even for doses of 0.2 mg kg(-1). The maximum effect was observed for doses of 0.5 mg kg(-1). Honokiol at any dose in both single and repeated administration schedules caused neither change in motor activity nor disruption of traction performance. Orally administered diazepam, 0.5-2 mg kg(-1), caused dose-dependent prolongation of the time spent in the open arms of the maze with a significant increase in motor activity at 1 mg kg(-1), and dose-dependent disruption of traction performance. The changes in the plus-maze performance after treatment for seven days with 0.2 mg kg(-1) honokiol and after a single treatment with 1 mg kg(-1) diazepam were almost equivalent. The effect of honokiol (0.2 mg kg(-1), treatment for seven days) was inhibited by subcutaneous flumazenil (0.3 mg kg(-1)) and (+)-bicuculline (0.1 mg kg(-1)) and by intraperitoneal CCK-4 (50 microg kg(-1)) and caffeine (30 mg kg(-1)). The anxiolytic effect of diazepam (1 mg kg(-1)) was also inhibited by flumazenil and bicuculline. However, the combined administration of diazepam with caffeine enhanced the effect, and diazepam completely reversed the effect of CCK-4. These results suggest that, in contrast with diazepam, honokiol selectively induces an anxiolytic effect with less liability of eliciting motor dysfunction and sedation or disinhibition. The combined effects of the drug also revealed that the mechanism of anxiolytic effect of honokiol is partially different from that of diazepam.", 
    "94": "The in-vitro and in-vivo hydrolysis of two benzodiazepine compounds has been studied to evaluate their in-vivo activity in mice. Compounds RL 218 and RL 236, selected as representative examples of N,N-dialkyl-8-chloro-6-phenyl-6H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiaz epin-5-amines (1) and of their 5-(alkylthio) substituted analogues (2), were rapidly hydrolysed to the corresponding 8-chloro-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5(6H )-one 3 (RL 214) in aqueous acidic solution at pH 1.5. This reaction also occurred extensively in mice when compounds RL 218 and RL 236 were given orally but not intraperitoneally. Both compounds were active against pentylenetetrazole-induced lethal convulsions in mice only when administered orally. After administration of pharmacologically effective oral doses (ED50, the dose protecting 50% of mice), at the time of assessment of the anti-pentylenetetrazole activity, mean brain concentrations of RL 218 and RL 236 were below the limits of sensitivity of the analytical procedure whereas brain concentrations of their metabolite RL 214 were comparable with that present after an oral equiactive dose of this compound itself. RL 214 but not RL 218 or RL 236 had in-vitro affinity for brain benzodiazepine receptors. These results indicate that the anticonvulsant activity of RL 218 and RL 236 in mice depends essentially on their in-vivo transformation into the common active metabolite RL 214 which most probably arises as a result of acid catalysed hydrolysis in the gastric juice.", 
    "95": "Synthesis and evaluation of anticonvulsant activity of a series of 2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones (2) chemically related to 1-(4'-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-(methylenedioxy)-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (1, GYKI 52466) have been reported in our recent publications. Compounds 2 manifested marked anticonvulsant properties acting as 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists. In an attempt to better define the structure-activity relationships (SAR) and to obtain more potent and selective anticonvulsant agents, 1-aryl-3,5-dihydro-4H-2, 3-benzodiazepine-4-thiones 3 were synthesized from the corresponding isosteres 2. The evaluation is reported of their anticonvulsant effects, both in the audiogenic seizures test with DBA/2 mice and against the maximal electroshock- and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in Swiss mice. New derivatives 3 showed higher potency, less toxicity and longer-lasting anticonvulsant action than those of the parent compounds 2 in all tests employed. Analogous to derivatives 2, new compounds 3 do not affect the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) while they do antagonize AMPA-induced seizures; their anticonvulsant activity is reversed by pretreatment with aniracetam but not with flumazenil, thus suggesting a clear involvement of AMPA receptors. Electrophysiological data indicate a noncompetitive blocking mechanism at the AMPA receptor sites for 3i, the most active of the series and over 5-fold more potent than 1.",

    "100": "The domestic pig is a useful model in certain areas of biomedical research. Effective use of this species is often encumbered by lack of reference values in conscious as well as anaesthetized animals. Anaesthesia itself influences physiological and biological variables; the anaesthetic technique often affects experimental results. The relationship between anaesthesia and haemodynamics is well characterized in man, but less established in pigs. We studied the effect of midazolam-fentanyl-isoflurane anaesthesia in six immature, male, domestic pigs (Norwegian landrace). Haemodynamic variables (heart rate, arterial systolic, mean, diastolic pressures, pulmonary systolic, mean, diastolic pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), tissue perfusion, lymph flow (thoracic duct) were recorded for 3 h in animals with open chest through midline sternotomy. Variables relevant to fluid balance, e.g. interstitial hydrostatic pressure (Pi), serum-colloid osmotic pressure (s-COP) and serum-albumin (s-albumin) and -protein (s-protein) concentrations were measured. With the chosen anaesthetic technique haemodynamic variables, including lymph flow, and laboratory variables remained constant during the study period. Most variables were similar to conditions in humans. In contrast to adult humans exposed to the same anaesthetic technique, these pigs had lower haemoglobin-, s-albumin- and s-protein concentrations. A finding which may reflect immaturity. Liver and lung perfusion decreased significantly during the study period whereas perfusion of the other organs studied remained constant. Lack of responses to defined noxious stimuli during the study period suggest adequate analgesia. We conclude that midazolam, fentanyl and isoflurane provide cardiovascular stability including normal microvascular fluid exchange, which are essential elements for securing the quality of results obtained during cardiovascular research in anaesthetized pigs.", 
    "101": "Six female rats had a loading dose of 180 mg of diazepam (DZ) contained in two Silastic capsules implanted in their backs. Thereafter, a single 90-mg capsule was implanted weekly for 4 weeks prior to weekly microinjections of 1 microl of flumazenil (6.25, 12.5, or 25 microg) and PK 11195 (3.125, 6.25, or 12.5 microg) or vehicle into the CA1. Three control rats had empty capsules implanted but received only the high dose of flumazenil after 5 weeks. The time of DZ exposure spanned 8 weeks. Mean steady-state plasma levels of DZ were 1.06 +/- 0.11, and the mean total (DZ + metabolites) was 2.46 microg/ml +/- 0.37. Flumazenil elicited a dose-related precipitated withdrawal score (PAS) in DZ-treated rats (but not in controls) characterized by dose-related increases in convulsive (twitches and jerks), motor and autonomic signs, dose-related increases in the percent of total power in the low frequency (1-4 Hz), and decreases in the high-frequency (18-26 Hz) bands of the EEG recorded from the dentate and the amygdala. PK 11195 produced a dose-related increase in the 4-12 Hz band of the EEG recorded from the CA1, whereas the PAS was mild and not dose-related. However, the 6.25 and 12.5-microg doses elicited a significant PAS that tended to increase with dose. These data indicate that chronic DZ produces dependence, and that in the CA1 it involves the participation of central and possibly peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors located within this structure.", 
    "102": "Long-term use of psychotropic medication may increase the risk for epithelial ovarian cancer through increased gonadotropin secretion or direct ovarian stimulation of adrenergic receptors, effects which may affect ovarian cancer pathogenesis. An earlier case-control study found that prior use of antidepressants or benzodiazepine tranquilizers was associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. However, that study lacked details on all types of psychotropic medications, length of use, and the categorization of the specific action of these medications on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. In a new case-control study conducted in eastern Massachusetts (MA) and all of New Hampshire (NH), we identified all women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer between May 1992 and March 1997. We interviewed 563 women diagnosed with malignant or borderline epithelial ovarian tumors and 523 controls identified through random digit dialing and the use of Town Books (residential listings by name, age, and precinct). Participants were asked to provide the name of medications used for 6 months or longer, the age at first use, and total months or years of use. Psychotropic medications included amphetamines, sedatives, barbiturates/anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. Self-reported use of psychotropic medication for 6 months or longer was associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of invasive ovarian cancer [odds ratio (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.3]. Relative to nonusers, risk was greatest in those whose first use occurred premenopausally for more than 2 years (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.3-6.6). The association was largely confined to use of medications that operate through dopaminergic mechanisms (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.3-6.4) or gabaergic pathways (OR, 1.5; CI, 0.9-2.5) as opposed to serotoninergic pathways (OR, 1.0; CI, 0.4-2.1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that psychotropic medications induce gonadotropin secretion, which in turn may increase ovarian cancer risk. However, until other studies confirm our findings and determine whether they apply to medications with specific neuroendocrine actions, it is premature to advise a change in clinical practice and conclude that these medications indeed play a role in the etiology of ovarian cancer.", 
    "103": "The effects of 0.5 mg triazolam (TRI) and 4 mg flunitrazepam (FNZ) on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) were studied in eleven (six for TRI, and five for FNZ) healthy young male subjects. C3 EEG channel data of one baseline night, three drug nights and two withdrawal nights were recorded and their analyzed using a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) method. Changes in the 0.5 Hz to 40 Hz power spectrum showed that: 1) both TRI and FNZ increased higher frequency activity and reduced lower frequency activity on the drug nights; 2) on drug nights, NREM sigma frequency power was more strongly enhanced by TRI than FNZ, while the beta power of both NREM and REM was more strongly enhanced by FNZ than TRI; 3) NREM alpha power increased on the second night of withdrawal from both TRI and FNZ; 4) the power spectra for both NREM and REM sleep returned to baseline levels by the fourth night of withdrawal from either TRI or FNZ. These findings suggest that 0.5 mg TRI and 4 mg FNZ have both common and differing pharmacological effects on the central nervous system. Such differences could be caused by differences in the dose, half-life or systemic distribution of these two drugs.", 
    "104": "To examine whether and how local somatothermal stimulation inhibits the function of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) in humans and in animals with different types of SO, we measured the activity of SO in anesthetized cats and rabbits by using continuously perfused open-tip manometric methods. Local somatothermal stimulation was achieved by applying an electroheating rod 0.5 cm away from the skin area near the right subcostal region. A heating pad was applied to the corresponding area in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and biliary manometry. The motility of the biliary tract in cats, in terms of gall bladder pressure, tonic and phasic contraction pressure and frequency of SO before and during local heat were significantly different, respectively. The local heat-induced SO relaxation was not inhibited by pretreatment with atropine, propranolol, phentolamine or anti-cholecystokinin-octapeptide, but was almost completely blocked by infiltration of local anesthetics. Pretreatment with a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor also blocked the relaxation, which was reversed by pretreatment with L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. The inhibition of SO motility by local heat in rabbits was also blocked by pretreatment with L-NAME, and this blockade was reversed by L-arginine. Application of local heat on patients demonstrated obvious inhibitory SO responses. We conclude that local somatothermal stimulation inhibits the SO motility in animals with different types of SO through the activation of heat-sensitive neural release of nitric oxide. This procedure may represent a simplified approach for the treatment of diseases with hypofunction of the L-arginine/NO pathway.",

However, when combined with antiepileptic drugs, this phenylbenzamide derivative (20 mg/kg) converted the subprotective doses of ethosuximide (100 mg/kg) or valproate (100 mg/kg) against the clonic phase into anticonvulsive ones. The protection observed was comparable to that noted after doubling the doses of these antiepileptics. Also, a combination of valproate (100 mg/kg) with CR 2039 (10 mg/kg) resulted in a clear-cut protection against clonic seizures induced by pentetrazol. The protective efficacy of clonazepam was not affected by the phenylbenzamide derivative up to 40 mg/kg. The potentiation of the anticonvulsive activity of ethosuximide or valproate was not accompanied by increased adverse effects, evaluated in the chimney test (motor coordination) and passive avoidance task (long-term memory). Finally, CR 2039 (20 mg/kg) did not alter the plasma levels of the antiepileptic drugs studied, which speaks against a pharmacokinetic mechanism in the observed results. In conclusion, CR 2039 seems devoid of a hazardous influence of the anti-asthmatic drug, aminophylline, on the anticonvulsive effects of conventional antiepileptics.",

The animals exhibited hypervigilance, aggressiveness, tachypnea, piloerection and frequent change of posture and also had raised plasma cortisol levels. These effects of PTZ were antagonized by benzodiazepines (diazepam; 1 mg/kg, i.v. and alprazolam; 0.05 mg/kg, p.o.). Non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (buspirone; 10 mg/kg, p.o.) blocked the behavioural effects but not the rise in plasma cortisol concentration. On the other hand, pretreatment with hypnosedative (promethazine; 5 mg/kg, i.m.) or anticonvulsant (sodium valproate; 40 mg/kg, p.o.) agents did not attenuate the effects of PTZ indicating the specificity of its anxiogenic response.

Lorazepam could induce physical dependence usually with a maximum (20% of the controls) on day four of withdrawal, but the age was a critical variable. A dose-response relationship with regard to lorazepam (0.5, 1, 2 mg kg(-1)) was found at 71 days but a more complicated pattern was found at 118 days of age. The rats treated with lorazepam 2 mg kg(-1) at the ages of either 71 and 118 days were given a treatment again with lorazepam 2 mg kg(-1) three months later.

    "122": "Dose-dependent increases in threshold for operant fear/escape responses of rats submitted to aversive stimulation of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dPAG) were recorded following intraperitoneal injection of three chemically unrelated but selective 5HT2C receptor agonists (Ro 60-0175, Org 12962 and Ro 60-0332) and fluoxetine. The decreased sensitivity of rats to the acute panic-like aversion elicited by stimulation of this limbic periventricular region was detected at dosages devoid of impairing effects on the latencies needed for operant brain stimulation interruption. In this paradigm which has been validated as a simulation of acute anxiety with relevance to panic disorder, the selective activation of 5HT2C receptors by Ro 60-0175, Org 12962 or Ro 60-0332 induces effects analogous to those observed following benzodiazepine receptor activation by antipanic agents such as clonazepam or alprazolam or following non-selective and indirect 5HT receptor activation by fluoxetine. Potency and efficacy of 5HT2C receptor agonists were intermediate between those of clonazepam and fluoxetine, indicating authentic antiaversive properties and suggesting antipanic potential for these 5HT2C receptor agonists. In addition, these data suggest that the 5HT2C receptor subtype may play a major role in the therapeutic properties of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It is also speculated that serotonin/benzodiazepine interactions existing in the brain may functionally involve the 5HT2C receptor subtypes and that the anxiogenic action reported under certain circumstances for 5HT mimetics are not mediated by 5HT2C receptor subtypes.",

Two other patients demonstrated periodic movements in sleep with muscle contractions and ballistic movements of the legs, two had periodic movements in sleep plus restless legs syndrome, and one had sleep starts involving only contraction of the arm muscles. Abnormal movements in sleep occurred in Stage II sleep in all patients, in Stage I in some patients, and could significantly disturb sleep architecture even though patients were totally unaware of muscle contractions. Poliovirus-induced damage to the spinal cord and brain is presented as a possible cause of abnormal movements in sleep. The diagnosis of post-polio fatigue, evaluation of abnormal movements in sleep, and management of abnormal movements in sleep using benzodiazepines or dopamimetic agents are described.", 
    "124": "Tolerance to anticonvulsant drug effects on kindled convulsions can result from drug exposure alone, but convulsive activity during drug exposure has a substantial facilitatory effect on tolerance development. Tolerance produced by drug exposure in the absence of a criterion response (in this case convulsions) has been termed pharmacologic tolerance (10); tolerance produced by drug exposure with concomitant performance of the criterion response has been termed contingent tolerance (1). The present study examines whether noncontingent drug exposure facilitates the development of contingent tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of ethanol and diazepam. Amygdala-kindled, Long-Evans rats were treated with either ethanol (5.0 g/kg once daily for 21 days) or diazepam (5.0 mg/kg three times daily for 10 days) in the absence of convulsive stimulation to produce pharmacologic tolerance--control rats received treatments of vehicle. Then, all of the rats were rendered contingently tolerant by a series of \"bidaily\" (once every 2 days) injections (ethanol 2.0 g/kg or diazepam 2.0 mg/kg), each 1 h prior to a kindled convulsion. The rats that had received noncontingent exposure to ethanol or diazepam developed contingent tolerance significantly faster than the control rats. These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying pharmacologic and contingent tolerance to anticonvulsant drug effects are additive.", 
    "125": "In previous work we have reported that microinjections of triazolam or pentobarbital into the medial preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus produce a hypnotic effect. This finding raised the possibility that the sleep-enhancing actions after systemic administration of these compounds might be mediated by hypnogenic mechanisms in the preoptic area. The current study examined whether sleep enhancement by triazolam requires the anatomic integrity of the preoptic area. Nine rats with histologically confirmed lesions of the preoptic area induced by ibotenic acid (2.5 microg/microl in 0.4 microl), and 10 rats that had undergone a sham lesion procedure, had 2-h sleep studies that confirmed that by day 5 measures of total sleep time and sleep latency had returned to preintervention values. Rats were then given triazolam 0.8 mg/kg or vehicle intraperitoneally in counterbalanced order, on days 7 and 9 postlesion, in an environment with an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C. Following injections at 1000 h, in conditions in which lights were on from 0800-2000 h, 2-h sleep studies were performed. In the lesioned rats, triazolam significantly decreased sleep latency and increased total sleep time, primarily by increasing NREM sleep, whereas injections of vehicle did not. In summary, parenterally administered triazolam was found to have hypnotic effects in rats who were 1 week post-preoptic area lesion. These data are interpreted in light of previous evidence of redundancy of sleep-regulating mechanisms in the nervous system.", 
    "126": "The objective of the study was to assess the validity of an activity monitor (AM) within a psychophysiological study. The AM was based on four body-fixed accelerometers and discriminated postures, transitions, and dynamic activities. Three subjects participated in each of two 4-hr sessions. During each session, consisting of two protocols, ambulatory accelerometer and heart rate measurements were made. The output of the AM was compared with simultaneously recorded video tapes. An overall agreement between AM and video of 88 and 96% was found. The number of transitions and dynamic periods, and the duration of activities were well determined. Posture-related heart rate changes were demonstrated. A three-sensor configuration hardly influenced the validity scores. The AM appeared to be a valid instrument to quantify aspects of physical activity, and offers new possibilities for ambulatory psychophysiological research.", 
    "127": "1. The effects of NO donors on Ca2+-dependent Cl- currents (ICl(Ca)) were investigated in freshly isolated cat tracheal myocytes using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. 2. With nystatin-perforated whole-cell recording, carbachol (CCh, >/= 1 microM) induced a transient inward current (ICCh) with a reversal potential of about -20 mV. Activation of ICCh probably occurred through the M3 muscarinic receptor, since nanomolar concentrations of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) greatly inhibited this current, while 11-(2-(diethylamino)methyl)-1-piperidinylacetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido (2,3beta) (1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) or pirenzepine at concentrations of up to 1 microM were almost ineffective. 3. Chloride channel/transporter blockers such as DIDS (100 microM), anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC, 100 microM) and niflumic acid (100 microM) greatly inhibited ICCh, but cation channel blockers, such as nifedipine (10 microM), Zn2+ (500 microM) or Gd3+ (500 microM), were without effect. 4. Activation of ICCh was strongly attenuated by pretreatment with ryanodine (4 microM) plus caffeine (10 mM). Addition of neomycin (1 mM) into the bath or inclusion of heparin (3 mg ml-1) in the pipette abolished a substantial part of ICCh. These results suggest that ICCh is ICl(Ca), which is activated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ release. 5. The nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) reduced the amplitude of ICCh dose dependently (IC50, approximately 10 microM). Similar inhibition was also exerted by other types of NO donor such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and (+/-)-E-methyl-2-(E-hydroxyimitol)-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3- hexeneamide (NO-R). 6. SNAP-induced ICCh inhibition was effectively antagonized by Methylene Blue (1-100 nM), and mimicked by dibutyryl cGMP (db-cGMP) (0.5-1 mM), whereas two structurally distinct types of cGMP-dependent (G)-kinase inhibitor, N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-isoquinilinesulphonamide (H-8, 2.5 microM) and KT5823 (1 microM), failed to counteract the inhibitory effects of SNAP or db-cGMP. Another G-kinase-specific inhibitor Rp-8-(para-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS; 1 microM) itself caused a marked reduction in ICCh. 7. SNAP (100 microM) or db-cGMP (100 microM) exhibited no inhibitory actions, when caffeine (10 mM) or photolytically released IP3 were used instead of CCh to activate the inward current. 8. These results suggest that inhibition of ICCh by NO donors involves a cGMP-dependent but G-kinase-independent mechanism, which may operate at a site(s) between the muscarinic (M3) and IP3 receptors.", 
    "128": "Amino acids in the alpha- and gamma-subunits contribute to the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A)-receptors. We show that the mutation of a conserved histidine residue in the N-terminal extracellular segment (alpha1H101R, alpha2H101R, alpha3H126R, and alpha5H105R) results not only in diazepam-insensitivity of the respective alphaxbeta2,3gamma2-receptors but also in an increased potentiation of the GABA-induced currents by the partial agonist bretazenil. Furthermore, Ro 15-4513, an inverse agonist at wild-type receptors, acts as an agonist at all mutant receptors. This conserved molecular switch can be exploited to identify the pharmacological significance of specific GABA(A)-receptor subtypes in vivo.", 
    "129": "We examined the antiepileptic properties of topiramate (TPM) in amygdaloid (AM) kindling in rats. Electrodes were implanted into the left AM of adult male Wistar rats. The animals were kindled at the after-discharge (AD) threshold. After the completion of kindling, the generalized seizure triggering threshold was determined. The drugs were administered intraperitoneally in animals which showed stable generalized convulsions at near-threshold stimulation. Intraperitoneal administration of TPM at doses of 25 mg/kg or more produced an anticonvulsive effect, but did not readily suppress limbic seizures. Complete suppression of AD was observed in only 3/8 rats at the highest dose of 200 mg/kg, which was not statistically significant. On the other hand, TPM at 100 and 200 mg/kg significantly delayed AM kindling. Thus, TPM showed modest therapeutic properties of conventional antiepileptic drugs in kindling model, those of TPM more closely resemble those of phenobarbital and the benzodiazepines than those of phenytoin and carbamazepine.",

Transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions can be measured; the later reflecting respiratory drive. We compared transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2 values with oxygen saturation in patients undergoing day-case bronchoscopy, to see if this information would further improve the safety of the bronchoscopic procedure. Twenty-two consecutive patients undergoing routine fibreoptic bronchoscopy (15 male, mean age 62.3 years; range 45-82 years), were studied using pulse oximetry (OXImeter, Radiometer) and transcutaneous PCO2/PO2 monitoring (TCM3, TINA, Radiometer). We documented a statistically significant increase in transcutaneous PCO2 from mean (SD) stable baseline levels of 5.8 (0.3) kPa (range 4.2-7.9 kPa) to mean peak levels during bronchoscopy of 7.0 (1.0) kPa (range 5.0-8.7 kPa). The time to first adverse change in transcutaneous PCO2 (P = 0.046) and PO2 (P = 0.035) occurred more rapidly than reduction in oxygen saturation in 19 of the 22 cases; median times for change in PCO2 of 67 s (range 10-1800 s), PO2 of 120 s (range 26-559 s) and oxygen saturation of 174 s (range 43-1332 s), timed from administration of i.v. sedation prior to each bronchoscopy. Transcutaneous PCO2/PO2 monitoring during fibreoptic bronchoscopy provided evidence of hypoventilation with significantly elevated levels of transcutaneous PCO2. This method of monitoring provides an earlier indication of respiratory depression during fibreoptic bronchoscopy compared with pulse oximetry.",

    "139": "Deafferentation induces rapid plastic changes in the cerebral cortex, probably via unmasking of pre-existent connections. Several mechanisms may contribute, such as changes in neuronal membrane excitability, removal of local inhibition, or various forms of short- or long-term synaptic plasticity. To understand further the mechanisms involved in cortical plasticity, we tested the effects of CNS-active drugs in a plasticity model, in which forearm ischemic nerve block (INB) was combined with low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the deafferented human motor cortex. rTMS was used to upregulate the plastic changes caused by INB. We studied six healthy subjects. In two control sessions without drug application, INB plus rTMS increased the motor-evoked potential (MEP) size and decreased intracortical inhibition (ICI) measured with single- and paired-pulse TMS in the biceps brachii muscle proximal to INB. A single oral dose of the benzodiazepine lorazepam (2 mg) or the voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channel blocker lamotrigine (300 mg) abolished these changes. The NMDA receptor blocker dextromethorphan (150 mg) suppressed the reduction in ICI but not the increase in MEP size. With sleep deprivation, used to eliminate sedation as a major factor of these drug effects, INB plus rTMS induced changes similar to that seen in the control sessions. The findings suggest that (1) the INB plus rTMS-induced increase in MEP size involves rapid removal of GABA-related cortical inhibition and short-term changes in synaptic efficacy dependent on Na+ or Ca2+ channels and that (2) the long-lasting (>60 min) reduction in ICI is related to long-term potentiation-like mechanisms given its duration and the involvement of NMDA receptor activation.",

No correlation between the serum concentration of the active moiety and the side effects evaluated by the UKU Side Effect Scale was found. The absence of CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers) or the coadministration of drugs other than benzodiazepines increased the ratio between parent compound and metabolite but did not significantly influence the C/D of the total active moiety. A therapeutic range for serum risperidone has not been established, but 6 mg/day is considered the optimum dose for most patients.
