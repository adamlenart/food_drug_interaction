One manifested periventricular leukoencephalopathy, and the other had periventricular leukoencephalopathy as well as porencephaly because of fetal distress and brain parenchymal hemorrhage in the neonatal period. They developed West syndrome at the age of 9 months. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography study performed after cessation of their seizures revealed an increase in glucose metabolism. The corresponding region presented low-level accumulation in [(11)C]flumazenil positron emission tomography. The patients remained seizure-free for more than 1 month, and their electroencephalograms only occasionally disclosed sporadic paroxysmal discharges. Because of the decreased density of benzodiazepine receptor in these lesions, the activity of the excitatory neuron system may overexpress that of the inhibitory neuron system, thus resulting in epileptogenesis of the lesions. It is suggested that fluorodeoxyglucose and flumazenil-positron emission tomography revealed functional abnormalities and that epileptogenesis of these patients is still active even when the patient is seizure-free and there are mild epileptogenic discharges on electroencephalogram.", 
    "1": "Spasticity is one of the most common symptoms presented by neurologic patients. Apart from surgical management, drug therapy is an important treatment of children suffering from spasticity. In this review, recent advances in the pharmacologic armamentarium are reported in detail. In particular, there are oral medications (benzodiazepines, baclofen, dantrolene sodium, alpha 2 adrenergic agonists) and parenteral medications (botulinum toxin type A and B, alcohol). Moreover, there is also baclofen that can be administered intrathecally. There are some reports supporting the use of intramuscular alcohol (45% and/or 5-7% phenol) to reduce spasticity without the loss of voluntary movement or loss of sensation. Among these drugs, intrathecal baclofen is one of the most effective substances that can reduce spasticity significantly in the upper and lower extremities. Finally, the effectiveness of therapy with botulinum toxin type A in the management of spasticity is analyzed. Botulinum toxin type A reduces hypertonia in the injected muscles for a period of 2 to 4 months without important side effects. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of available oral and parenteral drugs for treatment of spasticity in cerebral palsy and to outline indications and contraindications.", 
    "2": "Diazepam (DZP) has become a commonly used drug for treatment of acute repetitive epileptic seizures and febrile convulsions in children. Considering the advantages of rectal administration of DZP, the objective of our study was to formulate and evaluate rectal hydrogels containing DZP as a drug substance in combination with suitable co-solvents and preservatives. Prepared HPMC (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) hydrogels containing different concentrations of DZP (2, 4 and 6 mg mL(-1)) manifested good quality in respect to physico-chemical parameters (pH value, drug content, ingredients content and viscosity), antimicrobial efficiency and microbiological quality. Under the proposed HPLC conditions, satisfactory separation of DZP and the preservatives used was achieved. In vitro release studies have shown that the total amount of DZP was released in a period of 3 h. Prepared formulations were stable for four months at 26 degrees C (ambient temperature characteristic of the 2nd climate zone).", 
    "3": "Stopping antipsychotic treatment can interrupt improvement and exacerbate the illness. The reasons for discontinuing treatment during controlled clinical trials were analyzed to explore this phenomenon.", 
    "4": "A post-hoc, pooled analysis was made of 4 randomized, double-blind clinical trials, 24-28 weeks in duration, involving 1627 patients with schizophrenia or a related disorder. Analyses combined all the atypical antipsychotic treatment groups in the studies.", 
    "5": "The majority of patients (53%) stopped their treatment at an early stage. Poor psychiatric response along with worsening symptoms was the most frequently given reason for discontinuing the course (36%), which was substantially more common than discontinuation due to poor tolerability of the medication (12%). This phenomenon was corroborated by less improvement in patients who discontinued treatment compared with those who completed, based on the PANSS total scores. Discontinuation due to poor response was, apparently, more predominantly linked to patient perception than to physicians' conclusions alone (80% vs. 20%). Discontinuation due to patient perception of poor response appeared to occur particularly early in the course of treatment. Patients who discontinued due to poor toleration of the medication responded in a more comparable manner with completers.", 
    "6": "Discontinuing treatment may lead to exacerbation of symptoms, undermining therapeutic progress. In these studies, poor response to treatment and worsening of underlying psychiatric symptoms, and to a lesser extent, intolerability to medication were the primary contributors to treatment being discontinued. Our findings suggest that adherence may be enhanced by effective symptom control, as objectively measured and as subjectively perceived. Such strategies may improve patients' willingness to undertake long-term therapy and increase the likelihood of a better prognosis.", 
    "7": "The benzodiazepine lorazepam enhances the potential for inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) synapses in the cortex to stabilize postsynaptic, excitatory activity by synchronizing discharge rates at frequencies of around 40 Hz. Treatment with lorazepam also affects contour integration processes, suggesting that GABAA-mediated synchronization plays a role in visuospatial organization. This conclusion is supported by other physiological studies that link visual feature integration with neuronal synchronization.", 
    "8": "One experiment was conducted to assess variations in dynamic figural priming as a result of lorazepam administration.", 
    "9": "Observers were presented a modified version of a figural priming paradigm designed to investigate the effects of dynamic synchronization on visual feature integration. The priming paradigm consisted of premask crosses presented in a square arrangement within the same phase of a multiphase premask matrix oscillating at 40 Hz. Observers responded to a subsequently presented target square. The modification consisted of line elements presented at various distances relative to the unspecified extension of the lines making up the premask crosses. It was expected that priming effects would be enhanced for lines terminating close to the unspecified extension but only following administration of lorazepam.", 
    "10": "As anticipated, priming was enhanced substantially when the premask crosses flickered around static lines that terminated adjacent to the unspecified extension between the premask crosses. This effect was maximal following treatment with lorazepam.", 
    "11": "This finding supports the idea that GABAA-enhanced inhibitory synchronization mediates continuity coding during early visual processing.", 
    "12": "Atypical antipsychotics have become a common pharmacologic option for the treatment of various psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in older adults, although these medications have been officially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use only in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Despite the widespread use of these agents, there is a relative shortage of rigorously conducted trials. This review focuses on recently published randomized, blinded, controlled trials involving the use of atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia (n = 9) or schizophrenia (n = 3), with some discussion of published large, open-label studies and a few unpublished controlled trials. In general, the studies of patients with dementia reported modest efficacy of atypical antipsychotics when compared to placebo and conventional antipsychotics. In addition, an advantage in terms of motor side effects was consistently noted with atypical antipsychotics when compared to conventional antipsychotics. The studies have also shown, however, a greater risk of mortality and adverse cerebrovascular events with several of these agents than with placebo in individuals with dementia. There are insufficient data comparing atypical antipsychotics to one another. In the trials involving elderly persons with schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotics were associated with significant improvements in psychopathology; differences in efficacy among atypical antipsychotics were unclear. A careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio of atypical antipsychotics, as well as that of available alternative treatments, is needed for each individual elderly patient. Clinical judgment, caution, and consent should be the watchwords in this area of psychopharmacology.", 
    "13": "This work presents the behavioral effects of riparin I (methyl ether of N-benzoyl tyramine) from unripe fruit of Aniba riparia (Lauraceae) on the elevated plus maze, open field, rota rod and hole board tests in mice. Riparin I was administered acutely by intraperitoneal (i.p.) and oral routes to male mice at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg. The results showed that riparin I (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p. and per os) increased the number of entries and the time of permanence in the open arms in the plus maze test. Similarly, in the hole board test, riparin I in both routes increased the number of head dips. Riparin I with both doses and routes had no effects on spontaneous motor activity in mice or in the rota rod test, but decreased the number of groomings. These results showed that riparin I by both administration routes has effects on the central nervous system with antianxiety effects on the plus maze and hole board tests. The substance is devoid of myorelaxant effects.", 
    "14": "The effect of midazolam on expression of c-Fos protein was examined in the rat hippocampus, following the open field test of neophobia. It was found that pretreatment of rats with midazolam, at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, enhanced rat exploratory behavior, and inhibited neophobia related stimulation of c-Fos in the CA-1 and CA-3 areas of the hippocampus. The presented results provide new immunocytochemical data on the involvement of hippocampus in emotional processes related to neophobia, and indicate a possible site of action of benzodiazepines.", 
    "15": "Analgesia and sedation, routinely used as adjunct medications for regional anesthesia, are rarely used in the pregnant patient because of concerns about adverse neonatal effects. In an effort to obtain more information about maternal analgesia and sedation we studied neonatal and maternal effects of iv fentanyl and midazolam prior to spinal anesthesia for elective Cesarean section.", 
    "16": "In this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 60 healthy women received either a combination of 1 microg x kg(-1) fentanyl and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) midazolam intravenously or an equal volume of iv saline at the time of their skin preparation for a bupivacaine spinal anesthetic. Sample size was based on a non-parametric power analysis (power > 0.80 and alpha = 0.05) for clinically important differences in Apgar scores. Fetal outcome measures included Apgar scores, continuous pulse oximetry for three hours, and neurobehavioural scores. Maternal outcomes included catecholamine levels, and recall of anesthesia and delivery.",

    "20": "Forty children (age four to six years) scheduled for myringotomy were randomly assigned, in a double blind fashion, to receive either oral midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 mixed with acetaminophen suspension or acetaminophen alone. The Emotionality, Activity, Sociability, and Impulsivity (EASI) scale was used as a measure of child temperament. The modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS), an observer-rated measure of state anxiety, was employed to assess anxiety pre- and post-drug, and also at induction of anesthesia.", 
    "21": "Children who received midazolam reacted significantly less to induction of anesthesia than did children in the placebo control group, F (1, 38) = 7.46, P = 0.01. A significant positive association was observed between baseline levels of anxiety and observer-rated anxiety at anesthetic induction, but only in the placebo group, r = 0.58, P < 0.01. A significant positive association was observed between levels of impulsivity at baseline and observer-rated anxiety at anesthetic induction, but only in the midazolam group, r = 0.42, P < 0.05.", 
    "22": "Midazolam dampened adverse reactivity during anesthetic induction, particularly among children with high baseline levels of anxiety. Baseline level of impulsivity was positively associated with adverse reactions to anesthesia induction in the drug group, but not in the placebo group, suggesting that high levels of trait impulsivity may contraindicate the use of midazolam as a preoperative medication.", 
    "23": "To assess how patients' underlying anxiety affects their experience of distress, use of resources, and responsiveness toward nonpharmacologic analgesia adjunct therapies during invasive procedures.", 
    "24": "Two hundred thirty-six patients undergoing vascular and renal interventions, who had been randomized to receive during standard care treatment, structured empathic attention, or self-hypnotic relaxation, were divided into two groups: those with low state anxiety scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, scores < 43; n = 116) and those with high state anxiety scores (> or = 43; n = 120). All had access to patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl and midazolam. Every 15 minutes during the procedure, patients rated their anxiety and pain on a scale of 0-10 (0, no pain/anxiety at all; 10, worst possible pain/anxiety). Effects were assessed by analysis of variance and repeated-measures analysis.", 
    "25": "Patients with high state anxiety levels required significantly greater procedure time and medication. Empathic attention as well as hypnosis treatment reduced procedure time and medication use for all patients. These nonpharmacologic analgesia adjunct treatments also provided significantly better pain control than standard care for patients with low anxiety levels. Anxiety decreased over the time of the procedure; patients with high state anxiety levels experienced the most significant decreases in anxiety with nonpharmacologic adjuncts whereas patients with low state anxiety levels coped relatively well under all conditions.", 
    "26": "Patients' state anxiety level is a predictor of trends in procedural pain and anxiety, need for medication, and procedure duration. Low and high state anxiety groups profit from the use of nonpharmacologic analgesia adjuncts but those with high state anxiety levels have the most to gain.", 
    "27": "Transfer-appropriate-processing accounts of memory emphasize the similarity of encoding and retrieval processes, and imply that experimental manipulations should have similar effects on encoding and retrieval. Exceptions to this expectation are thus of great interest, but extant exceptions (produced by studies using divided attention, alcohol, and benzodiazepines) are debatable, single dissociations between encoding and retrieval. The present experiments demonstrate a reversed dissociation, in which the same variable produced opposite effects when implemented at encoding and retrieval. At encoding, participants either solved anagrams of study words or read intact study words. At retrieval, participants likewise solved anagrams or read intact words prior to making recognition memory judgments. Compared with reading intact words, solving anagrams at encoding enhanced later recognition accuracy, whereas solving anagrams at test impaired accuracy. These results were obtained with old/new decisions (Experiment 1) and with confidence ratings (Experiment 2).", 
    "28": "There are situations in drug development where one may wish to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of whole body physiologically based pharmacokinetic models. A technique for formal reduction of such models, based on global sensitivity analysis, is suggested. Using this approach mean and variance of tissue(s) and/or blood concentrations are preserved in the reduced models. Extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST), a global sensitivity technique, takes a sampling approach, acknowledging parameter variability and uncertainty, to calculate the impact of parameters on concentration variance. We used existing literature rules for formal model reduction to identify all possible smaller dimensionally models. To discriminate among those competing mechanistic models extended FAST was used, whereby we treated model structural uncertainty as another factor contributing to the overall uncertainty. A previously developed 14 compartment whole body physiologically based model for diazepam disposition in rat was reduced to three alternative reduced models, with preserved arterial mean and variance concentration profiles.", 
    "29": "To report a case of delirium probably caused by the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine in a 74-year-old man with dementia.", 
    "30": "A 74-year-old white man with a diagnosis of severe dementia of mixed etiology with behavioral disturbances was admitted to an urban teaching hospital for increasing agitation in the context of worsening dementia. Olanzapine 2.5 mg each evening was started for agitation, and the dose was titrated to 5 mg each evening with additional emergent doses. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, was increased from the admission dose of 10 mg/day to 15 mg/day. The patient developed symptoms of delirium on hospital day 4. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and other causes of delirium were ruled out. Discontinuation of olanzapine resulted in resolution of the delirium.", 
    "31": "Antipsychotic medications are commonly used to treat symptoms of delirium. Atypical antipsychotics are better tolerated in the elderly because of their fewer adverse reactions compared with other antipsychotics. Olanzapine has been successfully used in the treatment of delirium. However, there have been case reports of delirium associated with olanzapine, probably related to its intrinsic anticholinergic effect. Application of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the onset of delirium and the use of olanzapine in this patient. As of December 1, 2005, this was the second such report of a case in the elderly.", 
    "32": "Although olanzapine is useful in the treatment of delirium, elderly patients treated with this drug can develop delirium and hence should be closely monitored.", 
    "33": "Cerebral monitoring indices are associated with a large degree of inter-patient variability and electrical signal interference during surgery. We designed this clinical study to test the hypothesis that use of the spectral entropy (Entropy) module is associated with less frequent intraoperative interference with the displayed indices than the bispectral index (BIS) monitor when used during general anesthesia with propofol and desflurane. Thirty consenting patients scheduled for major laparoscopic surgery procedures were enrolled in this prospective study. The elapsed time to obtain a baseline index value was recorded, as well as the simultaneous state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and BIS values at specific time intervals during the induction, maintenance, and emergence periods in patients administered a standardized general anesthetic technique. During the maintenance period, the changes in these indices were evaluated after a bolus dose of propofol (20 mg IV) and a 2% increase or decrease in the inspired concentration of desflurane. As expected, the baseline SE values were less than the RE and BIS values (88 +/- 2 versus 96 +/- 3 and 96 +/- 4, respectively). However, the SE and RE values correlated with the BIS value during the induction (r = 0.77 and 0.78, respectively) and emergence (r = 0.86 and 0.91, respectively) periods. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of consciousness also indicated a similar performance of the SE (0.93 +/- 0.04) relative to the RE (0.98 +/- 0.04) and BIS (0.97 +/- 0.04). During the maintenance period, the responses to changes in propofol and desflurane concentrations were consistent with all three indices. Finally, the entropy indices were less interfered with by the electrocautery unit during the operation (12% versus 62% for the BIS monitor). Because the average selling prices of the Entropy and BIS disposable electrode strips (14.25 dollars versus 14.95 dollars USD, respectively) are comparable, we conclude that the Entropy module is a cost-equivalent alternative to the BIS monitor.", 
    "34": "Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition by a selective inhibitor valeryl salicylate, or nonselective inhibitors at 10 mg/kg, including aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and picroxicam, attenuated by 29%-46% the duration of loss of righting reflex induced by diazepam (20 mg/kg) in mice. On the other hand, arachidonic acid (20 mg/kg) increased the duration of diazepam-induced loss of righting reflex by 48%. This effect of arachidonic acid was abolished by aspirin. However, aspirin at 10 mg/kg also did not alter the effects of diazepam (5 mg/kg) on spontaneous activity and rotarod performance. These findings strongly suggest that one or more COX products, most likely prostaglandins, play a significant role in modulating the hypnotic effect of diazepam. Elucidating the mechanism involved may further our understanding of the pharmacology of benzodiazepines.", 
    "35": "Concomitant consumption of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and opioids is a major problem in patients with opioid dependence. It may have substantial impact on morbidity, mortality and clinical course. The current retrospective study aims to determine whether there are differences in the additional use of BZDs among addicts regularly taking methadone or codeine medications in treatment and untreated addicts injecting heroin. The records of 1,685 patients admitted for detoxification were analyzed using bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Demographic and drug related variables were considered, both as possible confounders and predictors of concomitant BZD use. Daily intake of BZDs was reported in 44.4% of the patients. Patients treated with methadone or codeine medications report daily intake of BZDs significantly more often than the heroin-dependent patients (p < 0.01). Using multiple regression analyses, the results were confirmed as independent from the assessed possible confounders. Further we found that daily use of alcohol or barbiturates, early onset of opioid use (p < 0.01), unemployment, having a substance dependent family member with, and a history of imprisonment (for all p < 0.05) were associated with concomitant daily consumption of BZDs in opioid dependent subjects. These finding underline the need to further explore the causes, interactions and consequences of concomitant BZD and opiate use.", 
    "36": "This study examines the nature, extent and consequences of prescription drug abuse among 143 ecstasy users in Miami. Participants were recruited through nightclub and college campus outreach, and through respondent referrals. Instrumentation included the Risk Behavior Assessment, Substance Abuse Module and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Median age was 23, 42% were female and 50% Hispanic. An arrest history was reported by 44%, and 33% reported prior drug/alcohol treatment. Prescription drug abuse was reported by 87%; alprazolam (57%), oxycodone (36%), hydrocodone (32%) and diazepam (30%) were cited most often. Prescription drug abusers were more likely to report polydrug use, drug treatment histories, risky drug use behaviors, and symptoms of depression. They also reported numerous physical, psychological and social consequences of prescription drug abuse. Additional studies among larger samples are needed to understand the processes of prescription drug access and the extent of integration in club drug using cultures.", 
    "37": "Drugs that enhance synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission are widely utilized in the clinical setting. Barbiturates and benzodiazepine receptor agonists, for example, both potentiate an inhibitory chloride conductance through GABA-gated channels, and thereby achieve their sedative-hypnotic effects. The primary locus of action of these agents, and indeed most neuroactive drugs, is the postsynaptic junction. By contrast, gaboxadol, a selective extrasynaptic GABA receptor agonist and late-stage investigational treatment for insomnia, acts on a unique delta-containing GABAA receptor subtype found exclusively outside of the synapse. Although the mechanistic details of extrasynaptic neurotransmission remain to be fully established, it is now clear that these receptors demonstrate unique pharmacological, biophysical and electrophysiological properties. Importantly, the delta-containing GABAA receptor subtype activated by gaboxadol is highly expressed in the thalamus, where it might behave as a 'gain control' (independently controlling the strength of signals) in the corticothalamic pathways that govern sleep-relevant neuronal oscillations. This unique mechanism has contributed to our increased understanding of sleep mechanisms, and targeting of this system offers potential advantages over existing insomnia treatments.", 
    "38": "Diazepam (DZ) reinforcement was tested under anxiogenic (public speaking) and neutral (computer task) conditions. Individuals with social anxiety disorder (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 11) participated in two 5-session phases. Each phase used a standard choice procedure (2 sample, 3 choice sessions) comparing 10-mg DZ and placebo. During the public speaking condition, DZ preference was greater among the participants with social anxiety compared with controls (81.8% vs. 36.4%; p < .05). Participants with social anxiety also gave DZ significantly higher crossover values on the multiple choice procedure under the speech condition compared with the computer condition. Subjective effects indicated that DZ reduced anxiety when levels were elevated during the speech in socially anxious participants. These results suggest that DZ reinforcement may occur under conditions of heightened anxiety by bestowing therapeutic efficacy.", 
    "39": "This experiment was designed to use the graded dose-related amnesia produced by the benzodiazepine lorazepam (1.0, 2.0 mg/70 kg, oral) and the anticholinergic scopolamine (0.3, 0.6 mg/70 kg, subcutaneous) as a tool to explore the cognitive and neurochemical mechanisms underlying metamemory in the judgment of learning paradigm, with a placebo-controlled independent groups design in healthy volunteers (n = 12/group). Results provide evidence for a pharmacological dissociation between effects on memory versus metamemory (relative accuracy of item-by-item monitoring) across a range of levels of memory performance and suggest that the drugs selectively impair those aspects of metamnemonic monitoring that require participants' awareness of their overall current state of functioning (absolute accuracy of prospective item-by-item monitoring, prospective global monitoring) but not those that rely solely on assessment of individual item characteristics (relative accuracy of item-by-item monitoring).", 
    "40": "The induction of anaesthesia for surgery is a stressful event for child. To treat pre-operative anxiety in children pharmalogical methods (premedication) and behavioural methods (the presence of parents during the induction of anesthesia) are used in combination with each other. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of two interventions to alleviate preoperative anxiety of 39 children who are undergoing minor surgery. We studied the influence of some psichological and social characteristics of child and parents on operative period.", 
    "41": "We studied 39 italian speaking children aged 2-14 years ASA 1. We used STAI, a semi structured interview, with questions in the social-demographical area, a valuation scale of the behaviour of the child completed by the anesthesist, a questionaire after surgery for the parent. The descriptive analysis has been performed taking into account the nature of variables (frequency distributions for nominal and ordinal variables; means and standard deviations for cardinal variables).", 
    "42": "The results show that the age of the child is strongly conditional to the level of stress: negative reactions are more usual in children of pre-school age. The sedative premedication is not an important factor in relieving anxiety, and this result contrasts with published studies, stating the premedication is more effective than presence of a parent. We obtained interesting results by relating the level of stress in the child with other variables: which parent, the level of stress according to the STAI, level of education, type of residence of parents.", 
    "43": "Mother's presence during induction resulted of paramount importance. This study shows that the premedication alone is not effective. Some social-demographical factors of the parents have influence.", 
    "44": "In our previous study, diazepam (DZP), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, failed to suppress foot-shock-elicited ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in adult rats that had been neonatally lesioned in the neocortex. Because neonatal lesion of the neocortex did not influence the production of USVs, the presence of an anxiolytic mechanism of DZP is suggested apart from any anxiogenic mechanism in the brain. However, the previous study did not indicate any specific cortical regional lesions that impaired the normal development of the anxiolytic mechanism in the brain. The present study was undertaken in order to examine whether neonatal lesion of the neocortex, smaller and more localized than that in the previous study, abolishes the anxiolytic effect of DZP on foot-shock-elicited and air-puff-elicited USVs. A neonatal lesion about 2 mm diameter was made in the unilateral frontal cortex frontal to the hindlimb area or in the occipital cortex caudal to the hindlimb area. The attenuating effect of DZP on the USVs elicited by both aversive stimuli was found to be abolished only in the frontal cortex-lesioned rats. This finding indicates that the frontal cortex is likely to be specifically involved in the normal development of the benzodiazepine-anxiolytic mechanism in the brain.", 
    "45": "New chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (Ch-Cl) ion-selective electrodes (conventional type) based on ion associates, chlordiazepoxidium-phosphomolybdate (I) and chlordiazepoxidium-phosphotungstate (II), were prepared. The electrodes exhibited mean slopes of calibration graphs of 59.4 mV and 60.8 mV per decade of (Ch-Cl) concentration at 25 degrees C for electrodes (I) and (II), respectively. Both electrodes could be used within the concentration range 3.16 x 10(-6)-1 x 10(-2) M (Ch-Cl) within the pH range 2.0-4.5. The standard electrode potentials were determined at different temperatures and used to calculate the isothermal coefficients of the electrodes, which were 0.00139 and 0.00093 V degrees C(-1) for electrodes (I) and (II), respectively. The electrodes showed a very good selectivity for Ch-Cl with respect to the number of inorganic cations, amino acids and sugars. The electrodes were applied to the potentiometric determination of the chlordiazepoxide ion and its pharmaceutical preparation under batch and flow injection conditions. Also, chlordiazepoxide was determined by conductimetric titrations. Graphite, copper and silver coated wires were prepared and characterized as sensors for the drug under investigation.", 
    "46": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD), the principal adverse effect of long-term conventional antipsychotic treatment, can be debilitating and, in many cases, persistent. We sought to explore the incidence and management of TD in the era of atypical antipsychotics because it remains an important iatrogenic adverse effect.", 
    "47": "We conducted a review of TD incidence and management literature from January 1, 1965, to January 31, 2004, using the terms tardive dyskinesia, management, therapy, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. Additional articles were obtained by searching the bibliographies of relevant references. We considered articles that contributed to the current understanding of both the incidence of TD with atypical antipsychotics and management strategies for TD.", 
    "48": "The incidence of TD is significantly lower with atypical, compared with typical, antipsychotics, but cases of de novo TD have been identified. Evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic therapy ameliorates long-standing TD. This paper outlines management strategies for TD in patients with schizophrenia.",

The other management strategies discussed may prove useful in certain patients.", 
    "50": "The effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing and membrane oxygenator (MO) on the concentrations of lorazepam and morphine in the neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit were evaluated using an in vitro model that included a closed ECMO circuit with a MO, heat exchanger, bladder and PVC tubing. The circuit was primed with blood, electrolytes, albumin and heparin and maintained at physiologic pH and temperature throughout by frequent measurement of blood gas pH and a temperature probe. Lorazepam and morphine were each studied separately in three separate, but identical circuits for 6 h on the day of circuit prime (new circuit) and then again for 6 h at 24 h (old circuit). Each circuit (new and old) was spiked once with lorazepam to a final concentration of 250 ng/mL or with morphine to a final concentration of 70 ng/mL in the circuit. Serial samples were drawn at baseline and every 30-60 min for 6 h at the site of injection and pre- and post-MO for each circuit. Lorazepam and morphine concentrations were analysed using gas chromatography with electron capture and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, respectively. The concentrations of morphine and lorazepam at various sample sites and time points were expressed as a percentage of the original concentration. This single-dose study shows that up to 50% of a dose of lorazepam and 40% of a dose of morphine may be extracted by PVC and MO during bypass, depending on the age of the circuit. As the circuits become older, this amount could increase. These data may explain, in part, the higher doses of lorazepam and morphine required to sedate patients during ECMO.", 
    "51": "[35S]TBPS binding to the GABAA receptor ionophore binding site is anion dependent. Using autoradiography on rat brain sections, we show that permeabilities of anions through the receptor channel correlate with their efficiencies to promote basal [35S]TBPS binding. Phosphate made an exception as it induced more binding than expected from its permeability. Well-permeable anions (chloride, nitrate, formate) allowed [35S]TBPS binding to be effectively displaced by 1 mM GABA, whereas low-permeable anions (acetate, phosphate, propionate) markedly prevented this GABA effect, especially in the thalamus, the transition from the high to the low GABA effect being between formate and acetate. In the presence of phosphate, GABA enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine site of recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors with the same efficacy but lower potency as compared to the presence of chloride, whereas [35S]TBPS binding was abnormally modulated by GABA. These results suggest that inorganic phosphate affects coupling between agonist and ionophore sites in GABAA receptors.", 
    "52": "Chronic migraine (CM) is an invalidating condition affecting a significant population of headache sufferers, frequently associated with medication overuse headache (MOH). Controlled trials and guidelines for the treatment of MOH are currently not available. We studied the efficacy of a therapeutic regimen for the withdrawal of the overused drug and detoxification in a sample of patients suffering from probable CM and probable MOH during admission in eight hospitals of Piemonte-Liguria-Valle d'Aosta. Fifty patients, 42 females (84%) and 8 males (16%), mean age at observation 50.66+/-13.08 years, affected by probable CM and daily medication overuse following IHS diagnostic criteria were treated as inpatients or in a day hospital. Headache index (HI) and daily drug intake (DDI) were used for evaluating the severity of headache and medication overuse. The patients were treated by abrupt discontinuation of the overused drug and by a therapeutic protocol including i.v. hydration, dexamethasone, metoclopramide and benzodiazepines for 7-10 days. Prophylactic medication was started immediately after admission. Analgesics or triptans were used under medical control only in cases of severe rebound headache. Diagnostic protocol included routine blood tests (at admission and at discharge), dosage of B12 and folic acid. Patients underwent follow-up controls one, three and six months after discharge. The initial diagnosis was probable CM in almost all patients included in the study (41 patients); in nine patients the diagnosis was not specified (coded only as CDH). The overused medications were simple analgesics in 17 cases (34%), combination analgesics in 19 cases (38%), triptans alone or with analgesics in 13 cases (26%) and ergotamine in 2 cases (4%). We collected data from 39 patients at first follow-up (1 month), 32 after 3 months and 14 after 6 months. Mean HI was 0.91 at admission, 0.22 at discharge, 0.38 after 30 days, 0.46 after 3 months and 0.48 after 6 months. Mean DDI was 2.80 at admission, 0.39 at discharge, 0.41 after 1 month, 0.52 after 3 months and 0.59 after 6 months. These results are on average positive and tend to remain stable with time. Although preliminary and obtained on a limited number of patients at 6-month follow-up, our results seem to be encouraging about the use of the proposed therapeutic protocol.", 
    "53": "The presence of significant and confounding psychiatric comorbidity is greater in patients attending headache clinics than in headache patients from the general population. The frequent comorbidity of headache with generalized anxiety disorder can take advantage of the administration of benzodiazepines. With regard to depression-related headache, it's wellknown that the antidepressive drugs can improve migraine as well as tension-type headache. Antiepileptic drugs give one more good opportunity. The recognition of a psychiatric comorbidity is mandatory for an accurate management of the patient because prevents the clinicians from using any drug that might be dangerous for a mysdiagnosed psychiatric disturbance and often permits to administer medications that can efficaciously control both headache and psychiatric disorders.", 
    "54": "Neuroactive steroids are a large group of substances having effect in the brain and on brain function. The steroids most studied are allopregnanolone (ALLO), tetrahydrodesoxycorticosterone (THDOC), pregnenolone sulfate (PS) dihydroepiandrosteronesulfate (DHEAS), and estradiol (E2). ALLO and THDOC are called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) steroids as they are positive modulators of the GABAA receptor in a similar way as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. GABA steroids not only have similar behavioral effects as benzodiazepines and barbiturates but, possibly, also similar adverse effects as well. This review aims to elucidate the possible role that neuroactive steroids play in the development of mood disorders in women. One of the most clear-cut examples of the interaction between mood, neuroactive steroids, and the GABA system is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is a cluster of negative mood symptoms occurring during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in 2-6% of reproductive women. Furthermore, certain women also experience adverse mood effects during sequential progestin addition to postmenopausal estrogen treatment, which is why the role of neuroactive steroids in postmenopausal women is also addressed in this review.", 
    "55": "BMS-214662 is a novel farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitor that has shown promising suggestions of single agent activity in patients with advanced solid tumors when administered as a 1 h intravenous (i.v.) infusion every 3 weeks. The degree of FT inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was greatest at the end of the infusion and rapidly reversed as the concentration of the drug in the plasma decayed. A second phase I trial of BMS-214662 administered as a weekly 24 h i.v. infusion was initiated to determine if the duration of maximum FT inhibition could be significantly extended by prolonging the infusion time and increasing the frequency of administration.", 
    "56": "Infusion of BMS-214662 was prolonged from 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 h in single patient cohorts and repeated weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks. The initial dose was 56 mg/m(2). When the infusion duration reached 24 h, the dose was escalated at a constant multiples of 1.4 in single patient cohorts until the occurrence of toxicity greater than grade 1, upon which groups of at least three patients were evaluated at each dose level. The plasma pharmacokinetics and FT inhibition in PBMCs were measured in all patients at the prospective maximum tolerated dose.", 
    "57": "Nineteen patients participated in the study (11 males/8 females) and the weekly dose was increased to a maximum of 300 mg/m(2) given as a 24 h i.v. infusion. Drug-related toxicity greater than grade 1 first occurred at 300 mg/m(2), with two patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicity. One patient developed a grade 3 hyponatremia and another developed reversible grade 3 diarrhea, grade 2 renal toxicity, and grade 3 transaminitis. A 275 mg/m(2) dose was then evaluated, where one of the three patients treated experienced reversible grade 4 renal toxicity and grade 3 diarrhea. In view of the identical renal toxicity at 275 mg/m(2) in another study and limited drug availability, there was no further accrual to this dose level and the study was closed. No evidence of antitumor activity was observed. The plasma pharmacokinetics of BMS-214662 was linear with high interpatient variability. In the three patients evaluated at the 275 mg/m(2) dose level, the maximum inhibition of FT activity in PBMCs was 47+/-23% of the baseline.", 
    "58": "Administering BMS-214662 as a weekly 24 h continuous i.v. infusion permitted a considerably greater dose intensity to be delivered as compared to a single 1 h infusion given once every 3 weeks. The more prolonged infusion schedule resulted in a much lower degree of maximum FT inhibition in PBMCs than achieved with the 1 h infusion, although the duration of enzyme inhibition was longer, consistent with the lower peak plasma concentration of the drug provided by comparably tolerated doses when given as a 24 h infusion. Similarly, delivering the drug with increased dose intensity permitted by this weekly administration schedule did not appear to enhance its therapeutic benefit, at least in this phase I trial. Continued development of BMS-214662 may depend upon the potential for using it in combination with other anticancer drugs.", 
    "59": "This paper describes the process evaluation of an out-patient detoxification service (ODS) established by Drug Health Services (DHS) to increase the supervised withdrawal options for substance users in a Sydney metropolitan Area Health Service. The ODS aimed to provide a safe and effective supervised withdrawal to substance users who were at low risk of severe withdrawal, engage those with severe dependence in further treatment and increase the involvement of general practitioners (GPs) in the medical care of ODS clients. During its first 10 months of operation, the ODS received 199 inquiries, assessed 82 individuals and admitted 76 clients for detoxification. Withdrawal treatment proceeded without complications and within the expected time frames. Fifty-four clients completed withdrawal, 10 ceased treatment, 10 remained in treatment without completing withdrawal and two were transferred elsewhere. Clients who injected substances (mainly heroin) daily at admission, compared to others, were less likely to complete withdrawal and more likely to use a range of non-prescribed substances during withdrawal. One-fifth of clients went on to further treatment with DHS, attending at least once. Overall, the ODS met its goals, providing a safe and effective supervised withdrawal to local residents, especially women, young people and those withdrawing from benzodiazepines who had significant substance dependence, impairment and previous alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment. Non-injecting substance users benefited most from the ODS in terms of withdrawal completion and ongoing treatment. The level of GP involvement in the conjoint care of ODS clients remained constant over time. The development and expansion of the ODS are discussed.",

    "61": "Benzodiazepine (BZ) anxiolytics mediate their clinical effects by enhancing the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. Classical BZ full agonists such as diazepam, which maximally enhance the function of GABA-A receptors, are effective anxiolytics but carry unwanted side effects including sedation, dependence and abuse liability, limiting their utility. Although a second generation of 'partial agonist' BZs have been pursued, promising preclinical data, in terms of anxiolytic efficacy and decreased unwanted effects, have so far failed to translate to the clinic. Following the insights into GABA-A receptor subtypes mediating the effects of BZs, a third generation of 'receptor subtype-selective' BZ site ligands have been developed. However, it remains to be determined whether promising preclinical data are recapitulated in the clinic.", 
    "62": "This aim of this study was to determine the effect of anaesthetic agents on stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). Fifty patients who were scheduled for operation and who had normal hearing were included in the study. All were given midazolam for premedication and propofol for induction. Anaesthesia was maintained in five different ways in each group of 10 patients. Groups I-IV received inhalational anaesthesia: group I received 70 per cent N2O plus 30 per cent O2, group II sevoflurane, group III desflurane and group IV halothane. Group V received total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol plus sufentanil. The SR and TEOAE of the patients were measured four times: on the day before surgery (first measurement), after premedication (second measurement), after induction of anaesthesia (third measurement) and during maintenance of anaesthesia (fourth measurement). Midazolam significantly increased ipsilateral and contralateral SR thresholds and decreased TEOAE wave reproducibility. Propofol significantly increased only the SR thresholds. The other anaesthetic agents significantly increased only the contralateral reflex thresholds. Of these, the highest increase was seen after sevoflurane and the lowest after halothane. The changes in TEOAE wave reproducibility due to anaesthetic agents used for maintenance were not significant. We concluded that midazolam premedication may affect audiological evaluation with SR and TEOAE tests, and sevoflurane should not be used when it is necessary to measure SR under general anaesthesia.", 
    "63": "A highly sensitive method has been developed for the analysis of 7-aminonitrazepam (7-ANIZ), the major metabolite of nitrazepam, in urine by trimethylsilyl derivatization-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Urine samples were extracted with ethyl ether-ethyl acetate (99:1, volume ratio). The extracts were derivatized with N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide, and the total ion current chromatograms of derivatives were acquired. 7-ANIZ was identified by the relative abundance of major characteristic ions in the mass spectrum of its derivative and the retention time of the mass chromatogram peaks of these characteristic ions. Based on the mass chromatogram of the base peak ion, quantification was performed using 7-aminoclonazepam (7-ACLZ) as the internal standard. The extraction efficiency of 7-ANIZ was 82.8%. The linear range was 10 microg/L - 500 microg/L. The limit of detection was 1.2 microg/L and the limit of quantification was 3.5 microg/L. The recoveries were 94.7% - 103.5%, and the RSDs were 3.9% - 5.4%. 7-ANIZ in the urine sample excreted by the subject over 96 h period after oral administration of 10 mg nitrazepam was measured. It is demonstrated that the method can be applied to the forensic identification.", 
    "64": "The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an established and important mediator of diverse forms of neuronal injury in experimental animals. However, its mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. We have reported previously that IL-1 markedly enhances excitotoxic injury induced in the rat by striatal administration of the excitotoxin alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), leading to widespread neuronal loss throughout the ipsilateral cortex. Here we tested the hypothesis that IL-1 causes this injury through induction and/or enhancement of seizure activity in the rat. Consistently with this hypothesis, intrastriatal injection of AMPA or AMPA with IL-1 in the rat brain increased c-Fos expression in regions similar to those in which c-Fos has been reported previously in response to seizures. A significant increase in cortical neuronal activity (number of c-Fos positive cells) was observed in response to AMPA with IL-1 compared with AMPA (8 hr after injection). Increased seizure duration [3,522 +/- 660 sec (SEM) vs. 1,415 +/- 301 sec; P < 0.001] and cell death volume (140 +/- 20 mm3 vs. 52 +/- 6 mm3; P < 0.001) were seen in response to coinfusion of AMPA with IL-1 vs. AMPA alone. In addition, the anticonvulsant diazepam (intraperitoneal) significantly reduced cell death (P < 0.001) and seizure duration (P < 0.001) induced by AMPA with IL-1, and a significant correlation was found between seizure duration and cell death volume. These findings support our hypothesis that IL-1 enhances excitotoxic injury by enhancement of seizures, which may be of relevance to IL-1 actions in other forms of neuronal injury, including cerebral ischemia.",

Various analgesic and sedative agents are used to decrease pain and anxiety during minor surgical procedures for hand trauma patients and provide more comfortable conditions for the surgeon.

    "66": "Forty ASA I-II (Assignment of the American Society of Anesthesiologists) patients who visited the emergency unit with hand trauma were randomized to 2 groups of 20 patients each. The control group received 1 microg/kg of fentanyl (i.v.) and 0.028 mg/kg of midazolam (i.v.). Additional 1 mg doses of midazolam were given by the anesthesiologist to keep the sedation level between 3 and 4. In the PCS group, the midazolam was administered after programming the apparatus. The settings were as follows: loading dose: 0.028 mg/kg, bolus dose 1 mg, lock-out period: 5 min and basal infusion rate: 0. The loading dose was given before local anesthesia. All patients received prilocaine hydrochloride (Citanest 2%, 10 mL) for local anesthesia. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiration rate (RR) were measured before intervention and at 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes.",

Although the sedation levels of all patients were satisfactory, the sedation levels of the control group were significantly lower at 5 and 15 minutes (p<0.05). The total midazolam dose was 4.3+1.1 in the control group and 4.0+0.8 in the PCS group. The patient satisfaction rate was 95% in the PCS group and 80% in the control group (p>0.05).",

    "69": "Disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle response is manifested in schizophrenia and Huntington's disease among other neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by sensorimotor gating deficit. Antagonism of GABAA receptor function was documented to reduce PPI response. However, whether GABAA antagonism reduces PPI response is yet to be established because of contradicting reports. Cefepime is one of the fourth-generation cephalosporins documented to antagonize GABAA receptor function. This study investigated the effect of intramuscular injection of cefepime (45 and 90 mg/kg) twice daily for three consecutive days on both PPI of acoustic startle response and acoustic startle amplitude in rats. The effect of administration of the GABAA receptor agonist midazolam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) in conjunction with cefepime on PPI response and startle amplitude was also investigated. Results showed that administration of both dose levels of cefepime caused PPI deficit. Treatment of animals with midazolam in conjunction with cefepime reversed the effect of the lower dose, but not the higher one, on PPI of startle response without affecting startle amplitude in both dose levels. Results of this study, therefore, support the view that GABAA antagonism reduces PPI response. It is also concluded that antagonism of GABAergic transmission may be involved in the effect of the lower dose of cefepime on PPI response. Other mechanisms may mediate the effect of the higher dose of cefepime on PPI response. Clinical investigations are needed to determine the consequence of using cefepime in disorders of sensorimotor gating.",

The changes consisted of poor organizational strategies, impaired set shifting, emotional indifference, reduced motivation, and impairment of emotional decision making. Memory and consciousness were undisturbed, as she was able to follow her profession as a teacher. During the episode, the EEG was marked by right frontal rhythmical spikes and waves with spread to the homologous left region. Behavioral abnormalities and EEG changes were successfully treated with intravenous diazepam. The clinical representation can be ascribed to alterations of prefrontal-subcortical circuits, especially the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal circuits. This unique case is classified as simple partial nonconvulsive status epilepticus with prefrontal disturbances as the sole manifestation.",

Rats ovariectomized 3, 6 and 12 weeks previously, were tested in the burying behaviour paradigm and in an automatic activity counter. The highest values of time spent burying were observed in the 12-week group. In general, the 12-week group was more responsive to diazepam than the 3-week group, while 8-OH-DPAT showed similar effects on time spent burying, independently of how long ago the ovariectomy was done. Detection of anxiogenic-like behaviours by the shock-probe burying test in rats after chronic absence of gonadal hormones could help in the understanding of mood changes associated with human menopause.", 
    "72": "The goals of this study were to evaluate techniques for collection of peritoneal fluid from calves, establish reference ranges for fibrinogen in peritoneal fluid during the 1st month of life, and determine if abomasal puncture would alter peritoneal fluid or hematologic variables. Twenty-two healthy Holstein calves underwent 3 peritoneal fluid collections on day 1, day 15, and day 30 of age. Fibrinogen concentration in peritoneal fluid was 0.20 g/dL and 0.10 g/dL (P < .05) for day 1 and day 30, respectively, and 0.10 at day 15 (P > .05) for calves without abomasal puncture. Plasma fibrinogen concentration was 0.60 g/dL and 0.70 g/ dL (P < .05) for days 15 and 30, respectively, in calves without abomasal puncture. There were no significant differences (P < or = .05) in peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood total protein and fibrinogen concentrations, specific gravity, total and differential cell count, or erythrocyte counts between calves with or without abomasal puncture. We concluded that the reference ranges established for fibrinogen and total protein concentration are important for accurate evaluation of peritoneal fluid in calves for further comparison with similar-aged animals with gastrointestinal-tract or abdominal-cavity disease. Additionally, accidental abomasal puncture does not alter values of fibrinogen, total protein, and nucleated cell count in peritoneal fluid and does not cause apparent clinical abnormalities.",

Two hundred and thirty-nine consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage procedures were included. Procedures in non-immunosuppressed patients were classified as controls (n = 91). Procedures in immunosuppressed patients who received midazolam consisted of stem cell transplant (34), solid organ transplant (25), chemotherapy (33), HIV with drug abuse (10), HIV (5), prednisone (17) and immunosuppression for other diseases (12). Intravenous propofol was administered during 12 procedures due to inability to achieve optimal sedation with midazolam in a previous bronchoscopy (stem cell transplant recipient 1, lung transplant for cystic fibrosis 5) and during the same bronchoscopy due to inadequate sedation with a high dose of midazolam--renal transplant recipient 1, drug abuse (HIV 1, renal transplant recipient 1), bronchoscopy combined with gastroscopy (2) and a hypoxemic patient (1).

    "78": "Tonic GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition is typically generated by delta subunit-containing extrasynaptic receptors. Because the delta subunit is highly expressed in the thalamus, we tested whether thalamocortical (TC) neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and ventrobasal complex exhibit tonic inhibition. Focal application of gabazine (GBZ) (50 microM) revealed the presence of a 20 pA tonic current in 75 and 63% of TC neurons from both nuclei, respectively. No tonic current was observed in GABAergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT). Bath application of 1 microM GABA increased tonic current amplitude to approximately 70 pA in 100% of TC neurons, but it was still not observed in NRT neurons. In dLGN TC neurons, the tonic current was sensitive to low concentrations of the delta subunit-specific receptor agonists allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (100 nM) and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP) (100 nM) but insensitive to the benzodiazepine flurazepam (5 microM). Bath application of low concentrations of GBZ (25-200 nM) preferentially blocked the tonic current, whereas phasic synaptic inhibition was primarily maintained. Under intracellular current-clamp conditions, the preferential block of the tonic current with GBZ led to a small depolarization and increase in input resistance. Using extracellular single-unit recordings, block of the tonic current caused the cessation of low-threshold burst firing and promoted tonic firing. Enhancement of the tonic current by THIP hyperpolarized TC neurons and promoted burst firing. Thus, tonic current in TC neurons generates an inhibitory tone. Its modulation contributes to the shift between different firing modes, promotes the transition between different behavioral states, and predisposes to absence seizures.", 
    "79": "Recent evidence suggests that GABA(A) receptors containing an alpha1 subunit mediate the sedative effect of diazepam, whereas receptors with an alpha2 subunit mediate this benzodiazepine's anxiolytic effect. Thus, compounds selective for GABA(A)-alpha2 receptors may offer advantages, i.e., lack of sedation, over current benzodiazepines. Whether such compounds would offer additional advantages over benzodiazepines is unclear. Here, we address the issue of physical dependence by comparing the GABA(A)-alpha1 affinity-selective drug zolpidem, the novel compounds 7-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(2-methyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine (L-838,417) and 6-fluoro-9-methyl-2-phenyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl-carbonyl)-2,9-dihydro-1H-pyridol[3,4-b]indol-1-one (SL651498) with functional selectivity for certain non-alpha(1) GABA(A) receptors, nonselective partial agonists [bretazenil, 1-[1-[3-(3-pyridyl)phenyl]benzimidazol-5-yl]ethanone O-ethyloxime (NS2710), and 5-furan-3-yl-1-(3-imidazol-1-phenyl)-1H-benzoimidazole (NS2664)], and nonselective full efficacy benzodiazepines, in a rapid precipitated withdrawal assay using the inverse agonist N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142). For all compounds, we determined in vitro IC50 values to displace [3H]flunitrazepam from rat cortex and in vivo ED50 values for displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam from mouse forebrain (including length of in vivo occupancy). In the precipitated withdrawal model, compounds were administered at a dose giving approximately 80% receptor occupancy, obviating major differences in central nervous system bioavailability. Mice were administered compounds twice daily for 4 days and on day 5, 20 h after the final dose, given a dose of FG-7142 (40 mg/kg i.p.) that did not induce seizures in control animals. In mice treated with the three subtype-selective compounds, FG-7142 did not induce seizures. Moreover, there was a low propensity for FG-7142 to induce seizures in animals treated with the partial agonists, whereas seizures were clearly seen in animals treated with most benzodiazepines. Nonetheless, differences among the benzodiazepines themselves, similarities between the partial agonists and subtype-selective compounds, the in vitro/in vivo potency, and in vivo receptor exposure time data suggest a complex interaction among selectivity, efficacy, potency, and receptor exposure in determining physical dependence liability of benzodiazepine site modulators in mice.", 
    "80": "We report on the development of solid phase microextraction probes for drug analysis, prepared with antibodies specific for benzodiazepines covalently immobilized to the surface. In the technique, immobilized antibody probes are exposed to a sample containing the drug for 30 min. Extracted drugs are subsequently desorbed from the probes in 500 microL of methanolic desorption solution, which is dried, reconstituted in a small volume of injection solution and analysed by LC-MS/MS. The antibodies were characterized both before and after immobilization, to facilitate the rational selection of antibodies for such analyses. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were compared as was the impact of affinity purification of the polyclonal antibody to isolate the drug-specific fraction. The probes were evaluated for utility in analyzing 7-aminoflunitrazepam at sub ng/mL concentrations in urine, which is expected to be found several days after a single oral dose of 2 mg of flunitrazepam. Such analyses are required in monitoring for abuse of this drug, both in terms of 'club drug' use and in cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault. In these cases drug concentrations in blood and urine are much lower than in chronic abuse cases and are difficult to analyse by conventional methods. The method developed has a limit of detection of 0.02 ng/mL, with accuracy ranging from 1% to 27% and precision (% R.S.D.) ranging from 2% to 10% between the lower and upper limits of quantitation for the analysis of 7-aminoflunitrazepam in urine. The dynamic range of the method is from 0.02 ng/mL, which is limited by the instrument sensitivity, to 0.5 ng/mL, which is approaching the capacity of the probes. This would allow for quantitative analysis of samples at concentrations below that measurable by many other methods for general benzodiazepines analysis from urine, and a highly selective screen for samples at higher concentrations. The method has similar limits of detection to the most sensitive literature methods specifically designed for such analysis but with the advantage of significantly simplified sample preparation. This simplification makes the technique more amenable for use by both professionals and non-professionals.",

Compared to controls, patients in a vegetative state show a substantial reduction of glucose metabolism and perfusion. While patients post-anoxia exhibit a rather homogenous cortical reduction of glucose metabolism, patients after head trauma often show severe cortical and sub-cortical reductions at the site of primary trauma. To distinguish reduced glucose metabolism due to neuronal inactivation from neuronal loss, flumazenil-PET, an indicator of benzodiazepine receptor density, could add valuable information on the extent of brain damage. Activation studies focus on the evaluation of residual brain network, looking for processing in secondary projection fields.

There are many ways that prescription drugs are diverted into the illicit market and varied reasons for use and abuse. Prescription drug abuse is further related to a number of negative consequences, including overdose. While seniors and women have been the primary focus for research in Canada on prescription drug abuse, adolescents and young adults have received less attention. Systematic epidemiological data specifically on prescription drug abuse in the Canada context are lacking and are needed in order to more clearly understand the reasons for the phenomenon and to develop and implement appropriate interventions.", 
    "89": "The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of bethanechol (BeCh) on contractility patterns of smooth muscle preparations of equine duodenum descendens, jejunum, caecum and pelvic flexure in vitro. Concentration-response relationships were developed for BeCh using in vitro assays with and without preincubation of muscarinic (M) receptor antagonists for M2 and M3 receptors. BeCh induced a significant, concentration-dependent increase in contractile response in equine intestine in specimens with circular orientation. The maximal effect was largest for jejunal specimens with no difference in EC50 within the different locations investigated. The M2 antagonist, AF-DX 116, caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve and the M3 antagonist, 4-DAMP (1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide), almost completely inhibited the effect of BeCh over the entire concentration-response curve. These data provide evidence that, although the effect of BeCh is predominantly mediated by M3 receptors, M2 muscarinic receptors also play a role in BeCh-induced contraction in specimens of equine intestine. The involvement of other muscarinic receptor subtypes cannot be excluded. Further studies are necessary to understand the effect of BeCh in vivo including diseased animals.", 
    "90": "A discrimination conditioned active avoidance reflex (CAAR) model in a T maze was used in 18 rats to study the effects of bilateral microinjections of the selective muscarinic M1 receptor blocker pirenzepine into the neostriatum on the acquisition of the CAAR and behavior in an open field test. There was sharp degradation of learning of the CAAR and a significant improvement in motor activity both in the open field test and in the maze itself in rats given bilateral microinjections (pirenzepine, 0.004 mg) into the neostriatum as compared with intact controls. This suggests that changes in motor behavior (a sharp increase in locomotor activity) may be among the reasons for difficulty in learning the CAAR in rats after pirenzepine microinjections. Another reason for difficulty in learning the CAAR in these animals may be impairment of the perception of the conditioned signals (a flashing light) and poor differentiation. This is particularly indicated by the delay in the start chamber (double that seen in intact animals) on presentation of conditioned signals despite the high level of motor activity. These results and published data provide evidence for the complex nature of changes induced by blockade of muscarinic M1 receptors in the neostriatum.", 
    "91": "Cognitive impairment occasionally occurs after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and usually resolves within a few days. Any prolonged cognitive alterations or confusional states may have additional causes and require extensive diagnostic effort. Since cognitive dysfunction can also be caused by ictal states, electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool for these conditions.", 
    "92": "We report on a female patient with pharmacotherapy resistant major depression who had been treated by a series of ECT and subsequently developed severe confusion and fluctuating amnesia.", 
    "93": "Laboratory and neuroimaging examinations were normal, however, EEG revealed a severe intermittent slowing with rhythmic high amplitude delta-/theta-activity and sporadic bitemporal sharp waves. Oral application of 1 mg lorazepam led to a sudden improvement of EEG abnormalities. Consequently, non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) was suspected and the patient was regularly treated with lorazepam, accordingly. Clinically the confusional and amnesic symptoms declined, whereas serial EEG recordings showed a further improvement and normalization of brain electric activity.", 
    "94": "Routine EEG is an indispensable tool in patients with sudden deterioration of cognitive functions and unclear neuropsychiatric symptomatology. A testing dose of lorazepam can help to classify EEG abnormalities in terms of ictal EEG patterns.", 
    "95": "Induction of CYP3A by St. John's wort (SJW) extracts with high hyperforin (HYF) content is well described. Since SJW products vary in the amount of HYF and other main constituents, the aim of the study was to evaluate the effect on CYP3A function of SJW preparations with a range from very low to high HYF content.", 
    "96": "Forty-two male, healthy volunteers were randomized into six parallel SJW medication groups with varying composition especially with regard to HYF content. Midazolam plasma concentration profiles were characterized after a single oral dose of 7.5 mg midazolam on the day before and on the 14th day of SJW medication.", 
    "97": "All SJW preparations tested resulted in a decrease in midazolam AUC, although the extent of the effect differed. The extract LI 160 (HYF 41 mg/day) decreased midazolam AUC0-12h by 79.4% (95% CI -88.6; -70.1), which was significantly greater than the effect by any other medication (p<0.05). SJW powder tablets 2.7 g/day (HYF 12 mg/day) resulted in a midazolam AUC0-12h decrease of 47.9% (95% CI -59.7;-36.2), while 2.7 g/day SJW powder tablets that were almost devoid of HYF (0.13 mg/day) reduced midazolam AUC0-12h by only 21.1% (95% CI -33.9; -8.3). Considering all six SJW medications tested, the extent of midazolam AUC decrease correlated significantly with increasing HYF dose (r=-0.765, p<0.001), but not with hypericin dose (r=-0.067; p=0.673).", 
    "98": "The extent of induction of CYP3A varies among St. John's wort products and depends on hyperforin dose.", 
    "99": "The authors investigated the effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs-olanzapine, perospirone, and quetiapine-on plasma homovanillic acid (pHVA) in male patients with chronic schizophrenia.", 
    "100": "In this prospective, open-label study, the subjects were 30 inpatients who were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, criteria for schizophrenia. The authors switched patients from typical antipsychotic drugs to olanzapine, perospirone, or quetiapine. Each patient gave informed consent for the research. pHVA was assessed before and after switching medications.", 
    "101": "After the switch, the authors found a significant improvement in psychotic symptoms, nonsignificant improvement in extrapyramidal symptoms, and a nonsignificant reduction in pHVA. In addition, the baseline pHVA correlated positively with the score changes from baseline in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, positive, and negative symptoms in the group with a whole sample and in the olanzapine-treated group, and with the score changes in the BPRS total and positive symptoms in the quetiapine-treated group.", 
    "102": "Our findings indicated that the preswitching pHVA levels could be used to predict changes in the psychotic symptoms of male patients with chronic schizophrenia when switching to atypical antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "103": "We tested whether diazepam, a GABA-ergic drug that also inhibits brain nitric monoxide formation, improves acute stroke prognosis.", 
    "104": "880 patients, randomized within 12 h of acute stroke, received diazepam 10 mg or placebo by rectiole, as soon as possible, followed by 10-mg tablets twice daily for 3 days. Primary outcome was independence (Rankin score <3) at 3 months; secondary outcome was complete recovery (Barthel index >or=95 or Rankin score <or=1).", 
    "105": "Intention-to-treat analyses on all 849 patients with full follow-up (50.4% on diazepam): odds ratio (OR) 1.14, 95% CI 0.87-1.49 for primary endpoint, and an OR of 1.26 (0.90-1.76) for complete recovery, both favoring diazepam. Adjusted analyses for all stroke patients (843): OR 1.20 (0.87-1.65), and 1.25 (0.89-1.74), respectively, and for all infarct patients (748): OR 1.31 (0.93-1.85), and 1.46 (1.02-2.09; p=0.037), respectively. Analyses restricted to cardioembolic infarct patients (200) showed treatment benefit for the primary outcome: OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.07-4.76, p=0.032, and complete recovery: OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.06-6.59, p=0.037. About one third of ischemic stroke patients had 'any adverse event', without any difference between treatment groups. In 95 intracerebral hemorrhage patients, frequency of pneumonia and death were higher in the diazepam group than in the placebo group: 35 and 10%, 22 and 12%, respectively.", 
    "106": "Although point estimates favored diazepam treatment in various analyses, our data did not confirm our primary hypothesis. Diazepam treatment seems beneficial in cardioembolic infarct patients, is safe in acute ischemic stroke, but may better be avoided in intracerebral hemorrhage.", 
    "107": "We report on two patients who presented with status epilepticus due to ingestion of rat poison containing tetramine. Both had eaten the same meal, subsequently presumed to be the source of the poison. Physical examination and investigation were unremarkable and diagnosis was based on patient history. Seizures were ultimately controlled with ketamine, after unsuccessful attempt of benzodiazepine and sodium thiopentone. One week after poisoning, both patients underwent one session of high-volume haemofiltration followed by charcoal haemoperfusion to eliminate the toxin from the body. Plasma tetramine levels then decreased from 0.95 microgram/mL to 0.35 microgram/mL and from 0.53 microgram/mL to 0.40 microgram/mL, respectively.", 
    "108": "The zolpidem discriminative cue is mediated by GABA(A)-alpha1 receptors, whereas the chlordiazepoxide cue may be mediated via non-alpha1 GABA(A) receptors because compounds with selective affinity for GABA(A)-alpha1 receptors fully generalize to the former cue. We predicted that L-838,417 [7-tert-butyl-3-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-6-(2-methyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine], a partial agonist at non-alpha1 GABA(A) receptors and an antagonist at GABA(A)-alpha1 receptors, would generalize to the chlordiazepoxide but not the zolpidem-discriminative cue. SL651498 [6-fluoro-9-methyl-2-phenyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl-carbonyl)-2,9-dihydro-1H-pyridol[3,4-b]indol-1-one] is a full agonist at GABA(A)-alpha2 receptors, with lower efficacy at GABA(A)-alpha3 receptors and least efficacy at GABA(A)-alpha1 and GABA(A)-alpha5 receptors. Because SL651498 has efficacy at GABA(A)-alpha1 receptors, we anticipated that it would generalize to both discriminative cues. Rats were trained to discriminate either zolpidem (3 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) from vehicle using a two-lever operant procedure. The generalization profiles of L-838,417 and SL651498 were compared with nonselective full agonists, GABA(A)-alpha1-selective ligands zolpidem and CL218,872 [3-methyl-6-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine], the nonselective partial agonist bretazenil, and the novel anxioselective drug ocinaplon. A nonselective partial agonist was included because L-838,417 and SL651498 are partial agonists at some GABA(A) receptors, and this property may influence their generalization profiles. All nonselective full agonists and ocinaplon fully generalized to both cues. CL218,872 and zolpidem generalized to zolpidem only, whereas L-838,417 fully generalized to chlordiazepoxide only. SL651498 fully generalized to chlordiazepoxide and occasioned significant zolpidem-appropriate responding. Bretazenil was similar to SL651498. In conclusion, at this training dose, the chlordiazepoxide-discriminative stimulus is mediated primarily via non-alpha1 GABA(A) receptors and the generalization profiles of the ligands tested seem to correspond with their in vitro profiles at GABA(A) receptor subtypes.", 
    "109": "Diazepam is widely used to relieve preoperative anxiety in patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of polymorphism in CYP2C19 and the effects of CYP3A4 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) content in blood on recovery from general anesthesia and on diazepam pharmacokinetics.", 
    "110": "Sixty-three Japanese patients were classified into the following 3 genotype (phenotype) groups on the basis of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of CYP2C19 polymorphism: no variants, *1/*1 (extensive metabolizer [EM]); 1 variant, *1/*2 or *1/*3 (intermediate metabolizer [IM]); and 2 variants, *2/*2, *2/*3, or *3/*3 (poor metabolizer [PM]). We assessed the effects of these polymorphisms and of CYP3A4 mRNA content in the lymphocytes on the patients' recovery from general anesthesia.", 
    "111": "CYP2C19 genotyping analysis in the 63 subjects showed that 32%, 46%, and 22% of subjects were classified into the EM, IM, and PM groups, respectively. The PM subjects showed a larger area under the curve representing the concentration of diazepam over a 24-hour period (AUC(0-24)) (2088 +/- 378 ng/mL.h(-1), P = .0259), lower clearance of diazepam (0.049 +/- 0.009 L.h(-1).kg(-1), P = .0287), and longer emergence time (median, 18 minutes; 25th-75th percentile range, 13-21 minutes; P < .001) in comparison with subjects in the EM group (AUC(0-24), 1412 +/- 312 ng/mL; clearance, 0.074 +/- 0.018 L.h(-1).kg(-1); and emergence time, 10 minutes, 8-12 minutes [median and 25th-75th percentile range]). The IM group also showed a longer emergence time (median, 13 minutes; 25th-75th percentile range, 9-20 minutes; P < .001) and a larger variation in this parameter in comparison with the EM group. The distributions of the CYP2C19 genotype were significantly different between the 2 groups (rapid emergence <20 minutes, slow emergence >20 minutes) (P = .0148). The mean value of the CYP3A4 mRNA level in the slow-emergence group (mean +/- SD, 4.80 +/- 3.99 x10(-10)) was significantly lower than that of the rapid-emergence group (mean +/- SD, 12.50 +/- 11.90 x10(-10)) (P = .0315). However, there was no significant correlation between emergence time and CYP3A4 mRNA levels (r = 0.239, P = .0601).", 
    "112": "We found that the CYP2C19 genotype affects diazepam pharmacokinetics and emergence from general anesthesia and that the slow-emergence group possesses lower levels of CYP3A4 mRNA than are found in the rapid-emergence group.", 
    "113": "The nervous system synthesizes steroids that regulate the development and function of neurons and glia, and have neuroprotective properties. The first step in steroidogenesis involves the delivery of free cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it can be converted into pregnenolone by the enzyme cytochrome P450side chain cleavage. The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein are involved in this process and appear to function in a coordinated manner. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mRNA and protein are widely expressed throughout the adult brain. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression has been detected in many neuronal populations, in ependymocytes, in some astroglial cells, in Schwann cells from peripheral nerves and in proliferating cells of the developing and adult brain. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein is colocalized in the same neural cells with P450side chain cleavage and with other steroidogenic enzymes. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression in the brain shows marked changes with development, aging and injury. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene may be under the control of diverse mechanisms in different neural cell types, since its expression is upregulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP) in gliomas and astrocytes in culture and downregulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP) in Schwann cells. In addition, activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and the consequent rise in intracellular calcium levels, activates steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and steroidogenesis in hippocampal neurons. In conclusion, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein is regulated in the nervous system by different physiological and pathological conditions and may play an important role during brain development, aging and after injury.", 
    "114": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor is a mitochondrial protein expressed at high levels in steroid synthesizing tissues, including the glial cells of the brain. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor binds cholesterol with high affinity and is a key element of the cholesterol mitochondrial import machinery responsible for supplying the substrate cholesterol to the first steroidogenic enzyme, thus initiating and maintaining neurosteroid biosynthesis. Neurosteroid formation and metabolism of steroid intermediates are critical components of normal brain function. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor also binds with high affinity various classes of compounds. Upon ligand activation peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-dependent cholesterol transport into mitochondria is accelerated leading in increased formation of neuroactive steroids. These steroids, such as allopregnanolone, have been shown to be involved in various neurological disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders. Thus, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor drug ligand-induced neuroactive steroid formation offers a means to regulate brain dysfunction. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor basal expression is upregulated in a number of neuropathologies, including gliomas and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in various forms of brain injury and inflammation. In Alzheimer's disease pathology neurosteroid biosynthesis is altered and a decrease in the intermediate 22R-hydroxycholesterol levels is observed. This steroid was found to exert neuroprotective properties against beta-amyloid neurotoxicity. Based on this observation, a stable spirostenol derivative showing to display neuroprotective properties was identified, suggesting that compounds developed based on critical intermediates of neurosteroid biosynthesis could offer novel means for neuroprotection. In conclusion, changes in peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and neurosteroid levels are part of the phenotype seen in neuropathology and neurological disorders and offer potential targets for new therapies.", 
    "115": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are abundant in the cardiovascular system. In the cardiovascular lumen, PBRs are present in platelets, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and mononuclear cells. In the walls of the cardiovascular system, PBR can be found in the endothelium, the striated cardiac muscle, the vascular smooth muscles, and the mast cells. The subcellular location of PBR is primarily in mitochondria. The PBR complex includes the isoquinoline binding protein (IBP), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT). Putative endogenous ligands for PBR include protoporphyrin IX, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN), and phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Classical synthetic ligands for PBR are the isoquinoline 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK 11195) and the benzodiazepine 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5 4864). Novel PBR ligands include N,N-di-n-hexyl 2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide (FGIN-1-27) and 7-chloro-N,N,5-trimethyl-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,5-dihydro-4H-pyridazino[4,5-b]indole-1-acetamide (SSR180575), both possessing steroidogenic properties, but while FGIN-1-27 is pro-apoptotic, SSR180575 is anti-apoptotic. Putative PBR functions include regulation of steroidogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, the mitochondrial membrane potential, the mitochondrial respiratory chain, voltage-dependent calcium channels, responses to stress, and microglial activation. PBRs in blood vessel walls appear to take part in responses to trauma such as ischemia. The irreversible PBR antagonist, SSR180575, was found to reduce damage correlated with ischemia. Stress, anxiety disorders, and neurological disorders, as well as their treatment, can affect PBR levels in blood cells. PBRs in blood cells appear to play roles in several aspects of the immune response, such as phagocytosis and the secretion of interleukin-2, interleukin-3, and immunoglobulin A (IgA). Thus, alterations in PBR density in blood cells may have immunological consequences in the affected person. In conclusion, PBR in the cardiovascular system may represent a new target for drug development.", 
    "116": "An automated HPLC method with column switching is described for the determination of quetiapine, clozapine, perazine, olanzapine and metabolites in blood serum. After clean-up on silica C8 material (20 microm particle size) drugs were separated on ODS Hypersil C18 material (5 microm; column size 250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) within 25 min and quantified by ultraviolet (UV) detection at 254 nm. The limit of quantification ranged between 10 and 50 ng/ml. At therapeutic concentrations of the drugs, the inter-assay reproducibility was below 10%. Analyses of drug concentrations in serum of 75-295 patients treated with therapeutic doses of the antipsychotic drugs revealed mean+/-S.D. steady state concentrations of 139+/-136 ng/ml for quetiapine, 328+/-195 ng/ml for clozapine, 48+/-27 ng/ml for olanzapine and 71+/-52 ng/ml for perazine. The method was thus suitable for routine therapeutic drug monitoring and may be extended to other drugs.", 
    "117": "In this study we have functionally characterized aripiprazole (OPC-14597; 7-(4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy-3,4-dihydro-2-(1H)-quinolinone), the prototype of a new generation antipsychotic drug termed dopamine-serotonin-system stabilizer, in cells expressing 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptor subtypes in comparison with olanzapine. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing 5-HT2 receptors, aripiprazole displayed a dual agonist/antagonist profile for 5-HT2C receptor (VNI isoform) mediated calcium signaling (EC50 1070 nM, IC50 281 nM). It exhibited no appreciable 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B agonism, whereas it antagonized 5-HT-stimulated calcium increase at either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptor expressed in CHO cells (IC50s of 369 and 0.46 nM, respectively). In comparison, olanzapine was devoid of agonism but was an antagonist at all three subtypes, with a potency rank order of 5-HT2A (IC50, 2.5 nM)>5-HT2B (47 nM)>5-HT2C (69 nM). In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transiently expressing 5-HT2C receptor isoforms, aripiprazole exhibited full agonism at the unedited INI, but partial agonism at the partially edited VNI and fully edited VSV isoforms (EC50s of 571, 1086 and 2099 nM, respectively). A partial antagonism was also observed for aripiprazole at the two edited isoforms (IC50s of 1138 and 1000 nM, respectively). In contrast, while lacking agonist activity at the VNI and VSV, olanzapine showed inverse agonism at the INI isoform (IC50 594 nM), reaching a maximal attenuation of 20%. In addition, olanzapine was a full antagonist at all three isoforms, with a rank order of potency of VNI (IC50, 79 nM)>VSV (101 nM)>INI (3856 nM). The modest 5-HT2A antagonism and 5-HT2C partial agonism, along with reported D2 and 5-HT1A partial agonism, may allow aripiprazole to stabilize the disturbed dopamine-serotonin interplay in schizophrenia with a moderate yet adequate pharmacological intervention. 5-HT2C agonism may also underlie the minimal weight gain seen with aripiprazole.", 
    "118": "Midazolam is currently the most used sedative agent in endoscopy. The present study was designed to examine the appropriate dose of midazolam, time of initiation of endoscopy after midazolam infusion, and to prove the necessity of flumazenil as an antidote.", 
    "119": "One hundred and eighty patients undergoing diagnostic gastroscopy were assigned three different amounts of intravenous midazolam in prospective, single-blinded and randomized setting as follows: (i) group I 0.03 mg/kg midazolam; (ii) group II 0.06 mg/kg midazolam; and (iii) group III 0.09 mg/kg midazolam. Endoscopy was initiated 30, 60 and 90 s after infusion of midazolam within each group. After endoscopy, patients were divided into two groups, one receiving flumazenil and one placebo in a double-blind fashion. The ease of the procedure, the conscious sedative state, the paradoxical response, the level of satisfaction and anterograde amnesia were assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale.", 
    "120": "The endoscopist's assessments were not changed by the different doses of midazolam; however, significant differences were observed in the paradoxical responses (P < 0.05). The level of satisfaction with endoscopy was notably different between group I and the other two groups (P < 0.05). Amnesia was boosted according with increasing doses of midazolam (P < 0.05). The time until discharge after endoscopy was significantly different between group III and the other two groups (P < 0.05) and the discharge time was reduced in the flumazenil subgroup compared with the placebo subgroup in group III (P < 0.05). Group II (0.06 mg/kg) reported good levels of satisfaction, fewer paradoxical responses and short discharge time without any side-effects. Comparing the time of initiation of endoscopy (at 30, 60 and 90 s after midazolam) in each group, there were no significant differences in the level of satisfaction, conscious sedative state and amnesia.", 
    "121": "Midazolam should be administered at a dose of 0.06 mg/kg and the endoscopy should be initiated 30 s after midazolam injection for appropriate effects without any side-effects. Flumazenil is not necessary, except in the case of the use of a high dose (above 0.09 mg/kg) of midazolam.", 
    "122": "Hypnotic drugs, including benzodiazepine receptor ligands, barbiturates, antihistamines, and melatonin receptor ligands, are useful in treating insomnia, but clinicians should consider the relative abuse liability of these drugs when prescribing them. Two types of problematic hypnotic self-administration are distinguished. First, recreational abuse occurs when medications are used purposefully for the subjective \"high.\" This type of abuse usually occurs in polydrug abusers, who are most often young and male. Second, chronic quasi-therapeutic abuse is a problematic use of hypnotic drugs in which patients continue long-term use despite medical recommendations to the contrary. Relative abuse liability is defined as an interaction between the relative reinforcing effects (i.e., the capacity to maintain drug self-administration behavior, thereby increasing the likelihood of nonmedical problematic use) and the relative toxicity (i.e., adverse effects having the capacity to harm the individual and/or society). An algorithm is provided that differentiates relative likelihood of abuse and relative toxicity of 19 hypnotic compounds: pentobarbital, methaqualone, diazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate, also known as sodium oxybate), temazepam, zaleplon, eszopiclone, triazolam, zopiclone, flurazepam, zolpidem, oxazepam, estazolam, diphenhydramine, quazepam, tra-zodone, and ramelteon. Factors in the analysis include preclinical and clinical assessment of reinforcing effects, preclinical and clinical assessment of withdrawal, actual abuse, acute sedation/memory impairment, and overdose lethality. The analysis shows that both the likelihood of abuse and the toxicity vary from high to none across these compounds. The primary clinical implication of the range of differences in abuse liability is that concern about recreational abuse, inappropriate long-term use, or adverse effects should not deter physicians from prescribing hypnotics when clinically indicated.", 
    "123": "Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies both have roles in the treatment of insomnia. The benzodiazepines, when first introduced, were a major improvement over earlier treatments for insomnia in terms of their safety and efficacy. Since then, the nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists have been developed, which have provided advantages over the older medications and are currently first-line medication treatment for insomnia. Although antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are often prescribed for the treatment of insomnia, they are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication and have side effects that are sometimes severe. New types of medications that have different modes of action from the benzodiazepine receptor agonists are now being developed, and one, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, has recently been approved for treatment of insomnia. Nonpharmacologic therapies can also help patients learn how to fall asleep faster and improve sleep quality. It is important for physicians to teach patients good sleep hygiene as part of their treatment. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in the treatment of insomnia, alone and in combination with pharmacotherapy, but finding a qualified provider can be difficult and the patient must be willing to take the time to learn the therapies and wait for them to show effect.", 
    "124": "Anxiety and depressive disorders often occur as comorbid illnesses and share many common symptoms. Risk factors for these disorders most likely include interactions of environmental and genetic factors. The presence of comorbid anxiety and depression adversely affects clinical and treatment outcomes. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are usually considered first-line treatment for patients with these disorders, although alternative antidepressants or additional therapies are often necessary. Studies suggest that benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and atypical antipsychotics may be effective as augmentation therapy to optimize outcome, with buspirone and beta-blockers useful in some patients as well. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is also an effective therapeutic alternative for affected patients.",

    "127": "All experiments were carried out in male CD rats. In separate studies, the effects of acute, sub-chronic (7 days) and chronic (28 days) olanzapine and risperidone administration on prolactin levels were determined. Further studies investigated the time course of the prolactin response following olanzapine and risperidone treatment over 24 h.", 
    "128": "Both drugs significantly increased prolactin levels in a similar manner following acute administration, in keeping with clinically reported data. However, this elevation was still present following sub-chronic and chronic treatment, contrasting with clinical data with respect to olanzapine but not risperidone. Over 24 h, olanzapine demonstrated a more transient elevation of prolactin levels, whereas risperidone caused a robust and persistent increase in prolactin up to 24 h post-dose, closely mimicking clinical results.", 
    "129": "The present study has demonstrated that olanzapine and risperidone display similar effects on prolactin levels in the rat following acute and chronic administration but differ in their prolactin response over a 24-h period.

    "130": "Brown fat uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose (FDG) on a positron emission tomography (PET) scan limits the ability to assess for cancer. Drugs such as benzodiazepine, propranolol, and reserpine have been proposed to reduce this uptake, but the studies have been either small clinical or preclinical trials. As an alternative, we evaluated the effect of controlling the patient's environmental temperature on brown fat uptake of FDG.", 
    "131": "From January 1, 2002 to November 30, 2004, patients were identified who had (1) a pattern of FDG uptake in the neck/paravertebral areas suggestive of brown fat, (2) a repeat FDG-PET scan after control of the patient's environmental temperature, and (3) no evidence of cancer in the neck/paravertebral areas by other diagnostic methods. For the follow-up PET scan, all patients wore warm clothing and avoided exposure to cold air during their transit to our facility. After arrival, patients were kept in a separate temperature-controlled room (at least 75 degrees F) for 15 minutes to two hours before FDG injection as well as during the uptake phase. Four physicians blindly and retrospectively assessed the FDG uptake in the neck and paravertebral regions on all initial and temperature-controlled PET scans by visually grading the radioactivity on a semiquantitative scale (0 = background, 1+ = background but <liver, 2+ = equal to liver, 3+ >liver). The changes in maximal SUVs were determined in the left and right neck region. Data were evaluated using a two-tail t-test.", 
    "132": "Ten patients met the above criteria. The median age was 32 years with a range of 11-58 years. In comparing the semiquantitative uptake and the SUVs of FDG in the neck and paravertebral areas on the initial PET scan to the temperature-controlled PET scan, the mean decrease and the standard deviation of the decrease demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in with P values range from <0.02 to <0.001.", 
    "133": "Controlling the patient's environmental temperature prior to the dosing and during the uptake phase can significantly reduce FDG uptake in brown fat in the neck and paravertebral areas. Further studies are warranted to determine the most effective protocol to control the patient's environmental temperature in order to minimize brown fat uptake.",

    "139": "Ramelteon, approved in the US for the treatment of insomnia characterised by difficulty with sleep onset, is a highly selective agonist for the melatonin MT1/MT2 receptors, which are believed to mediate the circadian rhythm in mammals. Ramelteon has negligible affinity for the MT3 binding sites and other receptors in the brain, including the opiate, dopamine, benzodiazepine and serotonin receptors, which may explain the lack of significant adverse events and lack of abuse or dependence potential observed with ramelteon. In three clinical trials in patients with chronic insomnia, ramelteon 8mg was effective in reducing sleep latency, without being associated with any significant or clinically relevant residual effects. It also generally increased total sleep time and, where assessed, sleep efficiency. In a first-night-effect model of transient insomnia, ramelteon 8mg was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing sleep latency and increasing total sleep time. Ramelteon was generally well tolerated; the most commonly reported adverse events occurring in more ramelteon than placebo recipients were somnolence (5% vs 3%), fatigue (4% vs 2%) and dizziness (5% vs 3%). Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in nature. Ramelteon has been shown to have no potential for abuse or dependence.", 
    "140": "In the clinic, low efficacy positive GABAA modulators might be preferred to high efficacy positive modulators insofar as low efficacy modulators might have comparatively less abuse and dependence liability. Drug discrimination was used to examine the behavioral effects of L-838,417 and bretazenil, two low efficacy positive GABAA modulators that act at benzodiazepine sites, alone and in combination with benzodiazepines and a neuroactive steroid (alfaxolone). In rhesus monkeys (n = 5) discriminating midazolam, alfaxolone substituted for midazolam. In four monkeys, L-838,417 and bretazenil did not substitute for, but rather dose-dependently antagonized, midazolam; L-838-417 and bretazenil, as well as flumazenil, enhanced the midazolam-like effects of alfaxolone. L-838,417 and bretazenil substituted for midazolam in a fifth monkey. In a separate group of rhesus monkeys (n = 3) that received 5.6 mg kg(-1) per day of diazepam and that discriminated flumazenil, L-838,417 and bretazenil substituted for flumazenil. These results demonstrate that L-838,417, bretazenil, and flumazenil can have agonist or antagonist actions in the same animal depending upon whether they are studied in combination with a higher efficacy positive GABAA modulator acting at the same (benzodiazepine) or a different (neuroactive steroid) site. Thus, combinations of low efficacy positive modulators acting at different sites on the GABAA receptor complex could yield drug mixtures with significant therapeutic effects and with reduced abuse and dependence liability, as compared to higher efficacy positive modulators such as currently available benzodiazepines.", 
    "141": "Benzodiazepines produce a broad spectrum of behavioral effects, which may be clinically desirable or undesirable, by positively or negatively modulating the effects of GABA at GABAA receptors. Over the past 20 years, much effort has been devoted towards identifying new compounds with limited undesirable effects. Most of this work has focused on developing drugs either with lower intrinsic activity than drugs such as diazepam, or with different binding profiles at subtypes of GABAA receptors. However, the benzodiazepine binding site is only one of multiple binding sites contained within the GABAA receptor complex, and other endogenous or exogenous compounds also may positively or negatively modulate the effects of GABA. Despite the availability of ligands for each of these distinct binding sites, very little research has examined the effects of GABA modulators given in combination. This may be due, in part, to the noncompelling results of those few studies which, depending on the particular drugs, have demonstrated site-selective antagonism or only additive effects, suggesting that each site modulates the effects of GABA independently. In this issue, McMahon and France challenge this view by showing that low-efficacy benzodiazepine ligands will effectively antagonize midazolam and, at the same doses, will enhance the effects of a neuroactive steroid. These studies raise interesting questions regarding the nature of the interaction between the benzodiazepine and neurosteroid binding sites on GABAA receptors.", 
    "142": "The pathogenesis of selective neuronal damage in internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease is unclear. Imaging of the central-type benzodiazepine receptor (BZR), which is expressed by most cortical neurons, provides information on the neuronal alterations induced by ischemia in vivo. Hemodynamic ischemia due to ICA occlusive disease may cause not only borderzone infarction but also selective neuronal damage beyond the regions of infarcts, which may be detected by a decrease in BZR in the normal-appearing cerebral cortex. The purpose of this study was to determine whether selective neuronal damage is associated with borderzone infarction in ICA occlusive disease.", 
    "143": "We measured BZR using PET and 11C-flumazenil in 62 nondisabled patients with ICA steno-occlusive lesions in the chronic stage. Flumazenil binding potential (BP) was calculated using the dynamic data and the reference tissue model. The infarcts on MRI-which were categorized as territorial, borderzone (external or internal), striatocapsular, lacunar, and other white matter infarcts-were correlated with the mean cerebral/cerebellar cortical BP ratio in the hemisphere with ICA occlusive disease.",

    "146": "gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a drug of abuse with actions at GHB and GABA receptors. This study examined whether the relative importance of GABA(A), GABA(B), and GHB receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB depends on the training dose. In comparison with a previous 100 mg/kg GHB-saline discrimination, pigeons were trained to discriminate either 178 or 56 mg/kg GHB from saline. Increasing the training dose shifted the GHB gradient to the right, and decreasing it shifted the gradient to the left. Similar shifts occurred with the GHB precursor gamma-butyrolactone, which substituted for GHB, and with the GABA(B) agonists baclofen and 3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid hydrochloride (SKF97541) and the benzodiazepine diazepam, each of which produced at most 54 to 68% GHB-appropriate responding. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, the benzodiazepine inverse agonist ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-4513), and the GHB receptor antagonist (2E)-5-hydroxy-5,7,8,9-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[a][7]annulen-6-ylidene ethanoic acid (NCS-382) produced a maximum of 66 to 97% GHB-appropriate responding in animals discriminating 56 or 100 mg/kg GHB and a maximum of 1 to 49% in animals discriminating 178 mg/kg. NCS-382 did not attenuate the effects of GHB. The GABA(B) antagonist 3-aminopropyl(diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP35348) blocked GHB at all training doses. The results suggest that increasing the training dose of GHB increases the pharmacological selectivity of its discriminative stimulus effects. At a high training dose, diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptors, for which flumazenil and Ro 15-4513 have affinity, may no longer be involved. Diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptors and GABA(B) receptors appear to play a similar role at all training doses. There was no evidence for GHB receptor involvement.",

We then further restricted our focus to the use of these drug combinations within a 30-day period prior to an injury-related medical event. The adjusted odds ratio on a variable characterising concomitant use of a benzodiazepine and another drug within this period was used to quantify the relative risk of injury. The principal outcome was the estimated risk of an injury-related health care episode within a 30-day period when taking both a benzodiazepine and another drug with a 'major' severity rating as defined by Micromedex.

    "160": "Beta-turns are important topological motifs for biological recognition of proteins and peptides. Organic molecules that sample the side chain positions of beta-turns have shown broad binding capacity to multiple different receptors, for example benzodiazepines. Beta-turns have traditionally been classified into various types based on the backbone dihedral angles (phi2, psi2, phi3 and psi3). Indeed, 57-68% of beta-turns are currently classified into 8 different backbone families (Type I, Type II, Type I', Type II', Type VIII, Type VIa1, Type VIa2 and Type VIb and Type IV which represents unclassified beta-turns). Although this classification of beta-turns has been useful, the resulting beta-turn types are not ideal for the design of beta-turn mimetics as they do not reflect topological features of the recognition elements, the side chains. To overcome this, we have extracted beta-turns from a data set of non-homologous and high-resolution protein crystal structures. The side chain positions, as defined by C(alpha)-C(beta) vectors, of these turns have been clustered using the kth nearest neighbor clustering and filtered nearest centroid sorting algorithms. Nine clusters were obtained that cluster 90% of the data, and the average intra-cluster RMSD of the four C(alpha)-C(beta) vectors is 0.36. The nine clusters therefore represent the topology of the side chain scaffold architecture of the vast majority of beta-turns. The mean structures of the nine clusters are useful for the development of beta-turn mimetics and as biological descriptors for focusing combinatorial chemistry towards biologically relevant topological space.",

In the diazepam group 17/20 (85%) patients responded in 10 minutes, but 3/20 (15%) did not respond. Midazolam was found to be as effective as diazepam and the difference was not statistically significant (p<0.05). Response periods of the 2 drugs showed no significant difference (p>0.05). The need for a second drug for seizures that did not stop with the first drug was equal, and the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). They did not observe any serious complications.

    "180": "Because it is the main determinant of clinical recovery, early reperfusion of the ischemic penumbra has become the mainstay of acute stroke therapy. Although early permanent recanalization can be associated with spectacular and complete recovery, some patients in fact exhibit delayed or incomplete recovery, even despite small infarcts on late structural imaging. This might result from tissue inflammation and selective neuronal death/damage, two probably inter-related cellular events well described in the animal literature, precluding full functional restoration in the salvaged penumbra. However, impact of these processes on recovery may be complex because of the interplay with ongoing plasticity and the possible promoting effect of inflammation on the latter. Preliminary results from imaging studies of inflammation and selective neuronal loss after middle cerebral artery territory stroke, using radioligands of the central benzodiazepine receptor and the activated microglia, respectively, reviewed here, suggest these phenomena also exist in man, although their relationship with acute-stage hypoperfusion and their impact on clinical recovery, if any, remain poorly understood. Furthermore, their inter-relationships in the salvaged penumbra have not been addressed. Better understanding of these potentially harmful processes might help to maximize benefits from thrombolysis, and could also have implications for patients who enjoy spontaneous recanalization.",

As a consequence, the in vitro and in vivo effects of this compound are mediated primarily via GABA(A) receptors containing an alpha5 subunit. In a mouse hippocampal slice model, alpha5IA significantly enhanced the burst-induced long-term potentiation of the excitatory postsynaptic potential in the CA1 region but did not cause an increase in the paroxysmal burst discharges that are characteristic of convulsant and proconvulsant drugs. These in vitro data suggesting that alpha5IA may enhance cognition without being proconvulsant were confirmed in in vivo rodent models. Hence, alpha5IA significantly enhanced performance in a rat hippocampal-dependent test of learning and memory, the delayed-matching-to-position version of the Morris water maze, with a minimum effective oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg, which corresponded to a BZ site occupancy of 25%. However, in mice alpha5IA was not convulsant in its own right nor did it potentiate the effects of pentylenetetrazole acutely or produce kindling upon chronic dosing even at doses producing greater than 90% occupancy. Finally, alpha5IA was not anxiogenic-like in the rat elevated plus maze nor did it impair performance in the mouse rotarod assay. Together, these data suggest that the GABA(A) alpha5-subtype provides a novel target for the development of selective inverse agonists with utility in the treatment of disorders associated with a cognitive deficit.",

In this study, we examined the involvement of benzodiazepine receptor functions in this diabetes-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. STZ-induced diabetes significantly increased the duration of immobility without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity. This increase was dose-dependently and significantly suppressed by a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.v.). However, flumazenil (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect the duration of immobility in non-diabetic mice. Furthermore, flumazenil (1 mg/kg, i.v.) had no significant effect on spontaneous locomotor activity in either non-diabetic or diabetic mice. The benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM; 0.03-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently and significantly increased the duration of immobility in non-diabetic mice, but not in diabetic mice. beta-CCM (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly suppressed spontaneous locomotor activity in non-diabetic mice, but not in diabetic mice. These results indicate that diabetic mice may have enhanced negative allosteric modulation by benzodiazepine receptor ligands, such as diazepam binding inhibitors, under stressful conditions, but not free-moving conditions, and this abnormal function of benzodiazepine receptors may cause, at least in part, the expression of depressive-like behavior in diabetic mice."
