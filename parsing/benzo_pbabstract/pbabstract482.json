    "0": "Some reports have shown that diazepam potentiates the neuromuscular blocking effect of pancuronium in in vitro experiments. Another report shows that a receptor for diazepam is present in the rat diaphragm and there is a direct blocking effect by diazepam of the neuromuscular junction of diaphragm muscle. Such interaction, consequently, may be related to the peripheral diazepam receptor. Based on such a hypothesis, RO15-1788, a recently developed diazepam antagonist, was used in an attempt to clarify the mechanism of such interaction. Hemidiaphragm preparations were immersed in an organ bath filled with Krebs solution which was bubbled with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide at 37 degrees C. The phrenic nerves were stimulated supramaximally at 0.1 Hz intervals. Mechanical twitch responses were recorded. The preparations were divided into five groups (group 1: treated with only 30 microM of diazepam, group 2: treated with 30 microM of diazepam and 3.0 microM of RO15-1788, group 3: treated with 30 microM of diazepam and 4.0 microM of RO15-1788, group 4: treated with 30 microM of diazepam and 6.6 microM of RO15-1788, group 5: without diazepam and RO15-1788). Cumulative dose-response curves were determined for pancuronium, and ED50 was calculated from each of the 5 curves. There was almost no effect of RO15-1788 in group 2, but RO15-1788 increased ED50 for 20% in group 3 (ED50 3.04 +/- 0.10 microM) and for 35% in group 4 (ED50 3.12 +/- 0.07 microM), respectively, as compared with group 1 (ED50 2.76 +/- 0.08 microM). This phenomenon shows that diazepam was antagonized significantly by RO15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Fifty outpatients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy under midazolam sedation were allocated randomly into two equal groups of 25 in this double-blind study. After the endoscopy, and 30 minutes after administration of the sedative, patients in one group received flumazenil 0.5 mg; those in the other group received a similar volume of vehicle only. Assessments of memory function, psychomotor performance and coordination were carried out and these were repeated 3.5 hours later. Flumazenil produced a significant improvement (p less than 0.001) immediately but no difference could be detected between flumazenil and placebo at 3.5 hours. However, patients in the flumazenil group reported, by means of linear analogue scales, a subjective feeling of alertness at the time of discharge, which was greater than that reported by those in the placebo group (p less than 0.005).", 
    "2": "In a double-blinded study, we have investigated psychomotor recovery after three sedation schemes during spinal anaesthesia for transurethral resection of prostate. Thirty-nine patients were allocated randomly to receive i.v. midazolam only, i.v. midazolam with antagonism by flumazenil or an infusion of propofol. The psychomotor tests were of long and short term memory, critical flicker fusion threshold, attention and concentration, cognition, mental arithmetic, and sedation and anxiety levels, and were performed before operation and at 30 min, 60 min, 2 h and 24 h after operation. Free recall of a picture learning task was the most sensitive test, showing a significant impairment in all groups, persisting for more than 2 h. Propofol was associated with the most rapid recovery and least impairment compared with preoperative baseline. Performance improved in all the tests after antagonism with flumazenil, but was still significantly impaired compared with baseline in tests of picture recall and letter deletion. Significant decreases in performance in all tests were detected 1 h after flumazenil. No increase in anxiety was recorded after flumazenil. We conclude that infusion of propofol is the technique with the most rapid recovery, while only brief and incomplete antagonism of the effects of midazolam may be expected with flumazenil.", 
    "3": "Alprazolam was studied for its effects on schedule-controlled behavior of squirrel monkeys. Monkeys responded by pressing a lever under fixed-ratio or two separate fixed-interval (FI) schedules. Responding was maintained by the presentation of food under all three schedules and was suppressed under one of the FI schedules by electric shock. Unlike lorazepam, alprazolam did not increase rates of either suppressed or nonsuppressed responding under the two FI schedules after acute administration. When given for 3 (at 0.03 mg/kg) or 11 (at 0.1 mg/kg) consecutive days immediately before test sessions, alprazolam also did not increase suppressed responding. Under all three schedules, alprazolam (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in response rate. The rate-decreasing effects of alprazolam were attenuated by drugs known to have benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist action: Ro 15-1788 (0.01 and 0.3 mg/kg), Ro 15-4513 (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) and 3-(methoxycarbonyl)amino-beta-carboline (10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg). These latter drugs alone either had no effect on or decreased fixed-ratio responding. Alprazolam also was tested in combination with lorazepam under the two FI schedules. In general, low doses of lorazepam, equal to or less than those having little effect on response rate when given alone, increased suppressed and nonsuppressed responding when combined with low to moderate doses of alprazolam. The results show that although the rate-decreasing effects of alprazolam probably are due to actions at BZ recognition sites, alprazolam alone does not have typical BZ-like agonist effects on FI responding; it did, however, potentiate the behavioral effects of lorazepam.", 
    "4": "The effects of N-(2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl) acetamide (DM-9384), a new pyrrolidone derivative, were investigated on ethanol- and chlordiazepoxide (CDP)-induced amnesia animal model using the passive avoidance task in comparison with aniracetam, another pyrrolidone derivative. Pretraining administration of DM-9384 attenuated ethanol- and CDP-induced amnesia, whereas aniracetam failed to do so. The effects of DM-9384 on CDP-induced amnesia were antagonized by bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, but not by scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist and flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. These results suggest that DM-9384 attenuates CDP-induced amnesia by interacting with the GABAergic neuronal system.", 
    "5": "Nine advanced gastric cancer patients were given 17 courses of cisplatin administrations by means of a 24-hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg/m2. For an anti-emetic, 40 mg of metoclopramide was administered 5 times at 6-hour intervals, along with a 500 mg hydrocortisone administration at the start of the cisplatin infusion. Despite this preventative treatment, nausea and/or vomiting occurred in over one-third of all the courses. Thus, to combat this nausea and/or vomiting, a combination of lorazepam (1.5 mg/day, divided into 3 p.o.), dexamethasone (20, 10 and 10 mg by i.v. at 3, 8, and 24 hours, respectively, after start of the cisplatin infusion), and a 60 mg intravenous administration of metoclopramide (5 times at 6-hour intervals) was given, and it was found that this new method (Method IV) prevented both nausea and vomiting.", 
    "6": "Of 114 patients presenting to the Pain Management Service at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine with chronic pain, 38% (N = 43) were taking one or more benzodiazepine drugs at the time of the initial assessment. The majority of patients were chronic users, with 14% (N = 6) having taken the medications for 1-2 years and 46% (N = 20) for 2 years or longer. Ninety-three percent (N = 40) of those given a benzodiazepine drug stated that it was initiated after the onset of pain. Although 86% (N = 37) were using the medication (all or in part) to improve sleep, they continued to report as many problems with sleep as the nonbenzodiazepine group did. Other drugs prescribed concurrently with the benzodiazepine drugs were narcotic drugs (58% of patients), antidepressant drugs (32%), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (26%), and others (16%). Benzodiazepines have been reported to provide little therapeutic benefit to chronic pain patients, and may even exacerbate their symptoms. We have shown that benzodiazepine drugs are frequently prescribed for long-term use, for sleep, and in conjunction with narcotic drugs. Such use is contrary to generally accepted guidelines.", 
    "7": "The hemodynamic effects of three commonly used muscle relaxants, pancuronium, vecuronium, and atracurium were investigated during induction of anesthesia with sufentanil and lorazepam in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Direct hemodynamic variables were recorded, and indirect parameters were calculated using standard formulae. Changes in heart rate differed with the three muscle relaxants. Pancuronium increased the heart rate whereas vecuronium and atracurium produced a decrease 5 minutes after induction (P less than 0.05). No differences were found in any other parameter during the study. A slow induction with sufentanil, lorazepam, and any of the three muscle relaxants was shown to minimize the hemodynamic changes.", 
    "8": "The combination of benzodiazepines and high-dose narcotics has been reported to produce hypotension in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. This study was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of lower doses of the narcotic sufentanil administered with the benzodiazepine midazolam. Thirty adult patients with good ventricular function undergoing elective coronary revascularization received sufentanil, 2.5 micrograms/kg, and midazolam, 0.1 mg/kg, followed by infusions of sufentanil, 0.7 to 1.5 micrograms/kg/h, and midazolam, 0.07 to 0.15 mg/kg/h. Overall, stable hemodynamics were achieved before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients who were not receiving preoperative beta-adrenergic blockade (n = 15) had increases from baseline heart rate and rate-pressure product after sternotomy, during aortic dissection, and after CPB that were not clinically significant. Five patients developed hypertension (increases greater than 20% over the baseline value), which was controlled with additional sufentanil or a vasodilator. Hypertension requiring vasodilator therapy did not occur in patients taking beta-adrenergic blockers. Blood pressure decreases exceeding 20% of the baseline value did not occur. Two of 15 patients receiving beta-blockers, versus 3 of 15 not receiving beta-blockers, developed ischemic electrocardiographic changes before CPB (NS); one of these patients without beta-blockade had a postoperative myocardial infarction. The results of this study show that the infusion of low doses of sufentanil with midazolam provides a hemodynamically safe and stable anesthetic for coronary artery surgery and avoids the hypotension seen when a high-dose narcotic is combined with a benzodiazepine.", 
    "9": "The hypothesis that benzodiazepines interact with their receptors in the CNS via hydrogen bonding mediated by the carbonyl and imine groups has been studied by correlating a physicochemical parameter affected by hydrogen bonds potentially accepted or donated by benzodiazepines with their binding constants to synaptosomal rat brain membranes. The reference physicochemical system chosen was normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography on mu-Bondapack NH2 (propylamine groups chemically bonded to porous silica) eluted with mixtures of n-hexane and 2-propanol. A strong correlation has been found for binding of the implicated groups to the column and to the receptor.", 
    "10": "Sixty patients being treated for anxiety in a primary care facility received (double-blind) buspirone, the benzodiazepine drug clobazam, or placebo for 3 weeks. The mean daily dose at the end of treatment was 23 mg for buspirone and 21 mg for clobazam. Patients were assessed weekly using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and Clinical Global Impression scale. Both active treatments produced significant improvement in anxiety symptoms compared with placebo as early as the first week of treatment, and there was progressive improvement over the subsequent 2 weeks. Response to buspirone was equally favorable in anxious patients who experienced depressive symptomatology.", 
    "11": "The azapirones, a unique pharmacologic class that includes buspirone and gepirone appear to offer the promise of both antidepressant and anxiolytic activity. Their singular affinity for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) type 1A (5-HT1A) receptor subtype may be the factor responsible for the therapeutic activity of these agents. It is hoped that the distinctive characteristics of this new class of drugs will lead to effective therapy for the treatment of mood disorders without the adverse or ancillary effects associated with currently available agents such as the benzodiazepines. The development of drugs for the treatment of anxiety has gradually evolved from less selective agents, such as alcohol, opiates, and the bromides, to progressively more specific drugs, leading ultimately to the development of the benzodiazepine anxiolytics in 1959. The approval of the azapirone buspirone in 1986 marked a new era of psychotherapeutic drug therapy. There is now evidence that this new generation of anxiolytic drugs may offer antidepressant potential in addition to its anxiolytic properties.", 
    "12": "Evidence suggests that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has a fairly chronic course marked by significant long-term distress and comorbidity. Research has focused on short-term treatment of GAD, and long-term outcome studies after either short- or long-term treatment have been relatively neglected. The authors discuss the benefits and risks of various drug and nondrug therapies used in the long-term management of generalized anxiety disorder and suggest avenues for future research.", 
    "13": "The pharmacokinetics of lormetazepam (LMA) was studied in five patients with intact and interrupted enterohepatic recirculation (EHR) after an oral dose of 0.03 mg/kg given as solution. The disposition of lormetazepam in plasma was characterized by peak plasma levels of 14-60 ng/ml after 20-40 min. Peak plasma levels of the unchanged drug were higher (p less than 0.05) in case of interrupted EHR as compared to intact EHR. The areas and the plasma levels vs time curves of lormetazepam and its glucuronide were not statistically different and the oral clearance of lormetazepam was similar in both parts of the study (median 3.1 and 3.6 ml/min/kg). In case of interrupted EHR, 23-58% of dose was excreted as lormetazepam and its glucuronide with the urine during 24 h, in case of intact EHR, the urinary dose fraction was 9-35% (p less than 0.05). The 24 h postdose-bile fraction contained only 0.3-2.8% of the oral lormetazepam dose in form of the drug and its glucuronide. In conclusion, only negligible amounts of lormetazepam are excreted in bile. The demethylated metabolite lorazepam was not detectable in the biological samples investigated.", 
    "14": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of oral estazolam at two and three times the usually recommended dosage (2 mg) on ventilation and respiratory drive during wakefulness. Sixty healthy subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of either: 1) estazolam 4 mg; 2) estazolam 6 mg; 3) placebo; or 4) morphine 0.15 mg/kg. Predrug and postdrug measurements were obtained for ventilation, respiratory cycle timing, metabolic rate, temperature, and ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) responses to exogenous CO2. No difference between placebo and the study drugs was noted during eupneic breathing. During administration of exogenous CO2, morphine caused a decrease in the slope of the ventilatory (-0.4 +/- 0.1 L/min/mm Hg, P = .008) and P0.1 (-0.22 +/- 0.06 cm H2O/mm Hg, P = .015) responses. Estazolam (4 and 6 mg) had no effect on the ventilatory response to exogenous CO2. However, estazolam (6 mg) caused the P0.1 at a PCO2 of 57 mm Hg to decrease (-0.67 +/- 0.30 cm H2O, P = .005). The preservation of ventilation with the highest dose of estazolam, despite the decrease in P0.1, indicates that a compensatory strategy independent of respiratory center drive may have been activated. Sedation was a common side effect of estazolam reported in 13% and 53% of subjects at the 4 mg and 6 mg doses, respectively. We conclude that a single, high dose of estazolam does not cause ventilatory depression during wakefulness in healthy subjects.", 
    "15": "The purpose of this study was to present a comparative and detailed picture of behavioral, physiological, and motor effects of some barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and neuroleptics, using an operant procedure of differential reinforcement of response duration (DRRD) in the dog. An increase in response rate with low doses of barbiturates and benzodiazepines is interpreted in terms of behavioral disinhibition, anxiolytic effect, and enhancement of motivation. The depressive effects noted with higher doses of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, as well as with all doses of neuroleptics, can be explained in different ways. For benzodiazepines and barbiturates, ataxic effects more than sedative or motivational effects are implicated. However, for neuroleptics, loss of motivation or \"anhedonia\" better explains the decrease in operant responding. Differences between the main classes of psychotropic drugs but also within a class between 1,4 benzodiazepines or 1,5 benzodiazepines, hypnotic or nonhypnotic benzodiazepines, and typical or atypical neuroleptics are highlighted and correlated with human observations.", 
    "16": "3-Alkoxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonylamino-4-(arylcarbonyl)pyr idines--in which the chlorophenyl ring of dipeptidylaminobenzophenones is replaced by a pyridyl ring--were synthesized and evaluated as anticonvulsants using subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) and maximal electroshock (MES) induced seizure screening tests. The substituent on the aryl ring of the 4-arylcarbonyl moiety was a determinant of activity in both tests, the potency order of substituents being generally 2-F greater than 2-H greater than 2-Cl. Compounds possessing a 3-benzyloxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonylamino substituent exhibited moderate activity in the scPTZ test, whereas all 3-tert-butoxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonylamino derivatives were inactive. The test results in the scPTZ screen suggest that the 3-benzyloxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonyl(N-methyl)amino compounds may undergo biotransformation, at least in part, to pyrido[3,4-e]-1,4-diazepin-2-ones. 3-Alkoxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonyl(N-methyl)amino-substituted compounds were always more potent than analogous 3-alkoxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonylamino-substituted compounds in the scPTZ test, whereas they were equipotent in the MES screen. Following oral administration, 3-benzyloxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonyl(N-methyl)amino-4-(2-chlorob enzoyl) pyridine exhibited a potency greater than that of valproic acid but less than that of clonazepam in the rat scPTZ screening test. 3-Benzyloxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonylamino-4-(2-fluorobenzoyl)pyr idine was the most potent compound in the rat oral MES screening test, exhibiting an activity greater than that of clonazepam but less than that of phenytoin. The 3-alkoxycarbonylaminomethylcarbonylamino-4-(arylcarbonylpyridin es had moderate affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor site(s); the IC50s in displacing 10 nM [3H]flunitazepam were in the 0.37-15.11 microM range (clonazepam = 0.003 microM).", 
    "17": "In this study, we evaluated the effect of a series of peripheral-acting benzodiazepines (BZDs), alone and in combination with recombinant human leukocyte (IFN-alpha A), fibroblast (IFN-beta), or immune (IFN-gamma) interferon (IFN), on the growth of human melanoma cells. Specific peripheral-acting BZDs caused a marked suppression in the proliferation of human melanoma cells. The effect on melanoma cell growth required 72 h exposure to the peripheral-acting BZDs and was not observed if the compounds were removed by 48 h. The relative potency of antiproliferative activity of a series of peripheral-acting BZDs on human melanoma cell growth did not correlate with the reported ability of these agents to bind to peripheral sites on the cell membrane of Friend erythroleukemia cells (FELC), nor did they correlate with the ability of these agents to inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation in FELC, induce differentiation in FELC, or inhibit neurite outgrowth in nerve growth factor-treated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The growth of human melanoma cells was also inhibited by various recombinant human IFNs, with IFN-beta displaying greater antiproliferative activity than IFN-alpha A or IFN-gamma. When the peripheral-acting BZD Ro7-3351, which displays growth inhibitory properties when used alone, was combined with IFN, the antiproliferative activity of the combination was greater than either individual compound exerted independently. The combination of IFN-beta plus Ro7-3351 was more active in suppressing HO-1 melanoma cell growth than other IFN preparations in combination with this peripheral-type BZD. Even when combined with a peripheral-acting BZD, such as Ro5-4608, which displayed only marginal antiproliferative activity against human melanoma cells when applied alone, growth suppression of the combination of this peripheral-type BZD with all three types of IFNs was more than additive. These studies suggest that specific peripheral-acting BZDs, both alone and in combination with recombinant IFNs, display novel antiproliferative activity toward human melanoma cells which may involve a different genetic locus than previously observed in other model cell culture systems.", 
    "18": "We have attempted to characterize a muscarinic receptor subtype involved in Cl- secretion in isolated epithelium of hen trachea, taking advantage of drugs developed in the last 15 yr. Hen trachea can be stimulated to secrete Cl- equal to approximately 80-90 microA/cm2 by application of acetylcholine (ACh) to the serosal side. The process has an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for ACh of 740 nM. The Cl- secretion is completely inhibited by 20 microM bumetanide at the serosal side. Of five selective antagonists for muscarinic receptors, pirenzepine, hexahydrosiladifenidol, dicyclomine, 11-([2-[(diethylamino)-methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one, and 4 diphenyl acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide, only the latter had a high affinity for the functional receptor with an apparent Kd of 3 nM. The receptor may be classified as an M4-muscarinic receptor subtype and probably belongs to a group of muscarinic receptors on exocrine glands and mucosal cells involved in ion transport. All the functional responses caused by muscarinic agonists and antagonists tested exhibited exponents (apparent Hill coefficients) in the range from 1.3 to 2.4, indicating a gain in the stimulus secretion coupling mechanism, an aspect of muscarinic receptor function that is not revealed in radioligand binding studies.", 
    "19": "mAbs bd 17, bd 24, and bd 28 raised against bovine cerebral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptors were analyzed for their ability to detect each of 12 GABAA receptor subunits expressed in cultured mammalian cells. Results showed that mAb bd 17 recognizes epitopes on both beta 2 and beta 3 subunits while mAb bd 24 is selective for the alpha 1 subunit of human and bovine, but not of rat origin. The latter antibody reacts with the rat alpha 1 subunit carrying an engineered Leu at position four, documenting the first epitope mapping of a GABAA receptor subunit-specific mAb. In contrast to mAbs bd 17 and bd 24, mAb bd 28 reacts with all GABAA receptor subunits tested but not with a glycine receptor subunit, suggesting the presence of shared epitopes on subunits of GABA-gated chloride channels.", 
    "20": "The aim was to find whether the chloride channel blocker, picrotoxin, at subconvulsant doses could affect the activity of imipramine or desipramine in the 'forced swimming' test with rats. It was found that picrotoxin enhanced the anti-immobility effects of imipramine and desipramine whereas open field activity remained unaffected or was even decreased by the same treatments. The results seem consistent with recent reports showing direct interactions between several antidepressant drugs and the GABAA receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ionophore complex (GABAA/benzodiazepine/Cl complex). The results also conform with the hypothesis that a reduction in the functionality of this complex could be related to the clinical effects of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "21": "The present experiments were undertaken to evaluate GABA sensitivity in dorsal raphe neurons following amygdala-kindled seizures. Dorsal raphe neurons of amygdala-kindled rats exhibited significant subsensitivity to GABA as measured electrophysiologically 3 or 4 weeks after the last stage 5 seizure. Amygdala stimulation with currents which did not produce kindled seizures did not produce subsensitivity to GABA. The subsensitivity observed after kindling was equivalent in magnitude to that observed following chronic diazepam treatment. However, exposure of fully kindled rats to chronic diazepam did not further decrease the sensitivity of dorsal raphe neurons to GABA. Additionally, while subsensitivity to GABA was reversed by bath application of the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, in chronic diazepam-treated rats, it had no effect on GABA subsensitivity in fully kindled rats. These findings suggest a decrease in GABA sensitivity within the dorsal raphe might reflect long-term neuronal changes associated with kindled seizures. These data also suggest that the decrease in GABA sensitivity of dorsal raphe neurons following chronic diazepam may involve different mechanisms from those observed after amygdala kindling.", 
    "22": "Pontomesencephalic benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors were measured at 4 h intervals throughout a 24 h day, and compared with those in frontal cortex, using [3H]diazepam binding. Animals were treated with saline, chloramphenicol (CAP) or thiamphenicol (TAP). An ultradian rhythm of receptors was observed in both cases, which was abolished by CAP but not by TAP. Saturation curves and Scatchard analysis indicated decreased binding was due to a decrease in the number of receptors. CAP effect on REM sleep, could be mediated by a general decrease of neurotransmitter receptors at precise periods of the wake-sleep rhythm.", 
    "23": "Monoclonal antibodies prepared against clathrin-coated vesicles cargo molecules were screened for their ability to precipitate the mAChR binding activity present in a light-density smooth membrane fraction from bovine brain called peak I. Only monoclonal antibody 10C7 was able to selectively sediment 38% (+/- 4.2) of the mAChR binding activity of peak I. Analysis by competition experiments of the supernatant obtained after the immunoprecipitation step reveals that neither the ratio of high/low affinity sites, nor the affinity ratio KH/KL was significantly altered for either of the muscarinic antagonists. The data implies that the bovine brain smooth-membrane compartment(s) expressing the mAb 10C7 antigen is also enriched in M1 and M2 mAChR.", 
    "24": "A negative-ion chemical ionization gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the determination of valproic acid (VPA) and fourteen of its metabolites in a single chromatographic run is reported. The assay features the use of four internal standards and is applicable to the analysis of small serum and urine volumes. A combination of pentafluorobenzyl and trimethylsilyl derivatization resulted in the [M - 181]- ion as the base peak for all the metabolites measured. When these ions were monitored sensitivities in the low picogram levels were achieved. The VPA metabolite profile was determined in pediatric patients on VPA monotherapy and on combined VPA therapy with either carbamazepine or clobazam. The recently characterized diene metabolite, (E,E)-2,3'-diene-VPA, was found to be a major serum metabolite of VPA. In the patient groups taking VPA in combination with carbamazepine, the induction of omega and omega-1 pathways of VPA metabolism was apparent, while the levels of the beta-oxidation products were significantly decreased.", 
    "25": "A number of studies in the past have indicated that certain types of dopamine receptor-mediated behaviours can be reversed by serotonin agonists. We have recently described a behavior in neonatal rats induced by the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393, which we termed vacillatory behavior. The current study was aimed at determining the effectiveness of several serotonin-specific agents at reversing this behavior. Behaviors measured on day 15 revealed that SKF 38393-mediated behavior was effectively blocked by SCH 23390 (a selective D1 antagonist), serotonin receptor agonists specific for the 5-HT1A receptor (buspirone and ipsapirone), and the serotonin uptake inhibitor clomipramine. However, the behavior was not reversed by diazepam. These data suggest that the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems must be in a proper balance for appropriate decision-making behaviors to occur.", 
    "26": "The effects of acute and chronic treatment with the 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam, were studied on fully kindled amygdaloid seizures in rats. After acute dosing, clobazam significantly reduced all parameters of kindled seizures (seizure severity, seizure duration, duration of amygdalar afterdischarges) at doses of 7.5 or 10 mg/kg i.p. 'Active' plasma concentrations of clobazam ranged between 300-800 ng/ml. The elimination half-life of clobazam in plasma was about 1 h. Only very low (10-75 ng/ml) levels of the major metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, were detected in rats. Administration of N-desmethylclobazam indicated that plasma concentrations of at least 300 ng/ml were necessary for anticonvulsant effects. During chronic administration of clobazam, 10 mg/kg 3 times daily, marked tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant and adverse (ataxiogenic and sedative) effects of the benzodiazepine. The experiment was repeated using a different protocol with minimized environmental stimuli and no amygdala stimulation during chronic clobazam administration. The loss of effects on seizure severity and motor function was similar to the first chronic experiment, whereas the loss of effects on seizure and afterdischarge duration was less marked. This indicates that conditioning of 'learned tolerance' is partly involved in clobazam tolerance in kindled rats. Intermittent injection of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, 5 mg/kg i.p. every third day, did not alter the loss of pharmacodynamic effects during chronic treatment with clobazam, but seemed to prevent hyperexcitation and other abstinence symptoms in the withdrawal period. The data indicate that periodic injection of a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist does not represent a possible therapeutic approach for preventing the development of tolerance during long-term benzodiazepine exposure.", 
    "27": "The effects of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 in combination with three CNS depressants (ethanol, benzodiazepine agonists and pentobarbital) were examined in three different experiments. Full antagonism of classical benzodiazepines by Ro 15-4513 was seen in all three situations. Partial antagonism of ethanol occurred in the pull up test of muscle relaxation in rats, but not in the inhibition of ultrasounds produced in rat pups by mild stress. The depressant effect of ethanol on twitching of the urethane-anaesthetised rat suprahyoid muscles was reversed. No attenuation of the effects of pentobarbital was seen in any test.", 
    "28": "Two commonly used drugs, Valium (diazepam) and Aspirin (acetylsalicyclic acid), were shown to suppress X-ray induced transformation in mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells. Valium was studied in an ethanol solution. Aspirin, which is soluble in both water and ethanol, was active only in the ethanol solution. Both drugs were effective only when present throughout the entire assay period.", 
    "29": "A double-blind randomised investigation with placebo control was undertaken to investigate the effect of 10 mg diazepam rectally or 1 g acetyl salicylic acid as effervescing tablets on pain and nervousness during and after outpatient cervical curettage and biopsy from the vaginal cervix or the cervical endothelium. A total of 97 women participated and were subdivided at random. Three patients were, however, excluded as they did not participate as planned. No differences were found between the three groups as regards pain and nervousness during the intervention and fatigue and drowsiness after the intervention. No statistically significant difference was found in the degree of satisfaction with the treatment in the various therapeutic groups.", 
    "30": "Alcohol withdrawal reveals a condition of central nervous system (CNS) hyperexcitability opposite to that of the primary effect of the drug. Adaption to the decreased activity of the CNS during chronic ethanol ingestion may at least partly explain several of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines are therefore useful in the withdrawal state. The benzodiazepine loading dose technique, giving diazepam 20 mg every hour until the patient shows signs of clinical improvement and mild sedation, is the choice of treatment in cases of moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal. In general, neuroleptics should be avoided, because of increased risk of convulsions, but haloperidol can be used to control hallucinations and severe agitation. This treatment should then be combined with benzodiazepines. Most patients with mild withdrawal symptoms respond to non-pharmacological supportive care, except for those with a history of withdrawal seizures. These patients may need treatment with carbamazepine or diazepam.",

Although several endogenous sleep-promoting substances are being intensively investigated, their application in therapy is not yet in view.", 
    "32": "The role of the serotonergic system in the regulation of hamster circadian rhythms was analyzed using intraventricular injection of the selective neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Sixty days after 5,7-DHT administration, immunoreactive serotonin in the forebrain, particularly the suprachiasmatic nuclei and intergeniculate leaflets, was severely depleted in 16 animals, moderately depleted in four and only slightly affected in four. 5,7-DHT produced an immediate and sustained advance of the onset of running wheel activity relative to the 24 h light-dark (LD) cycle. Activity onset occurred 0.7 +/- 0.07 h before lights out among 5,7-DHT-treated animals compared with 0.18 +/- 0.04 h after lights out for vehicle-infused controls. This new, advanced phase angle of entrainment was maintained throughout the 60-day period of the study while the animals remained in a LD cycle, including after an 8-h phase advance of the light cycle. 5,7-DHT treatment also delayed the offset of wheelrunning in 16 of 24 animals and reduced the likelihood of a smooth pattern of reentrainment to the shifted LD cycle. The drug treatment did not affect circadian period in constant darkness, the rate of reentrainment to an 8-h phase advance or the amount of wheelrunning activity per day. In addition, 5,7-DHT treatment had no effect on the ability of triazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, to accelerate the rate of reentrainment to an 8-h phase advance. These observations show that ascending projections of midbrain raphe serotonin neurons participate in the regulation of the circadian activity phase but are not required for triazolam-induced acceleration of reentrainment to a phase-advanced LD cycle.", 
    "33": "One group of 12 rats received discrete 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections into the caudate nucleus on one side of the brain and sham infusions on the other. Following chronic daily injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.) for 15 days, the caudate nuclei were separately dissected, and the number of benzodiazepine receptors labeled with [3H]Ro 15-1788 were assessed using individual homogenate receptor binding assays. A second group of 24 rats received bilateral infusions of 6-hydroxydopamine or sham infusions into the lateral ventricles followed by chronic cocaine or saline administration as described above. The animals were sacrificed by cardiac perfusion, and the brains were sectioned and prepared for light microscopic quantitative autoradiography. The extent of the lesion was assessed by measuring dopaminergic and noradrenergic uptake sites visualized with [3H]mazindol, while [3H]Ro 15-1788 was used to estimate the number of benzodiazepine receptors. Chronic cocaine administration resulted in significant increases in benzodiazepine receptors in the caudate nucleus, and these effects were attenuated following dopamine depletion. These data suggest that the effects of cocaine on benzodiazepine receptors may be mediated, in part, through the effects of the drug on dopaminergic neuronal activity.", 
    "34": "Monitoring with pulse oximetry, careful dosage and use of an ultra-slow technique in the administration of this potent drug for dental cases indicates that a continuous oxygen supplement would not appear necessary routinely. The value of a pulse oximeter cannot be over-emphasised. It enables one to observe, from its outset, any progressive oxygen desaturation and therefore early correction can be implemented.", 
    "35": "This study examined the effect of chronic diazepam administration on central benzodiazepine and CCK-8 receptor binding in rat brain. After a two-week treatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg per day) tolerance developed towards the sedative but not towards the anxiolytic action of this drug as determined using elevated plus-maze and open field tests. The % entries the rats made onto open arms and % time the rats spent in open arms were markedly decreased 24 h after the last dose of diazepam, probably indicating withdrawal anxiety. There were no changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding either 30 min or 24 h after the last diazepam dose. However, 30 min after the last diazepam administration the apparent number of sulphated [3H]CCK-8 binding sites was significantly increased in the primary olfactory cortex. Acute diazepam treatment (5 mg/kg) had no influence on [3H]flunitrazepam or sulphated [3H]CCK-8 binding in any brain region studied. Cessation of chronic diazepam treatment was followed after 24 h by an increase in the number of CCK-8 receptors in frontal cortex and hippocampus as compared to the vehicle group. These results demonstrate that certain alterations in CCK-8 receptor characteristics may be important in the anti-anxiety effect, tolerance, and withdrawal reaction reaction after benzodiazepine administration.", 
    "36": "The effects of tifluadom, a benzodiazepine-kappa-opioid-receptor agonist, on cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8)-induced antinociception were investigated in the mouse writhing test. When given alone, tifluadom produced pronounced, dose-dependent analgesia. The antinociceptive effect of intracerebroventricularly injected CCK-8 was potentiated by high doses of tifluadom. In contrast, when tifluadom was applied at low doses which did not induce antinociception, the antinociceptive effect of CCK-8 was completely antagonized. It is concluded that tifluadom acts both as kappa-opioid receptor agonist and as an antagonist at CCK receptors mediating CCK-induced antinociception.", 
    "37": "Stimulation of muscarinic M1-receptors in isolated rabbit vas deferens by McN-A-343 inhibited electrically induced twitch contractions susceptible to competitive blockade by (+)-, (+/-), (-)-telenzepine and pirenzepine (pA2 = 9.12, 8.86, 6.98 and 7.79, respectively). The inhibition of twitch contractions by 10(-6) M McN-A-343 (EC70-80) was reversed by the antimuscarinic agents (at concentrations 10-fold higher than pA2) in a time-dependent manner. The antagonists were then displaced by 3 X 10(-5) M McN-A-343 (30-fold EC70-80), which again led to inhibition of twitch contractions. Assuming first-order kinetics for M1-receptor blockade by the antagonists, t1/2 values for the start and end of blockade were calculated. For (+)-telenzepine, the t1/2 values for the rates for the start and end of blockade were 23 and 174 min, respectively, whereas (-)-telenzepine exhibited an inverse kinetic pattern of 3.0 and 0.38 min, respectively. The extremely slow dissociation of (+)-telenzepine from muscarinic M1-receptors may explain the long-lasting pharmacological effect of this compound in vivo.", 
    "38": "Basic systemic hemodynamic parameters were compared during intravenous anesthesia with calypsol (ketamine) and diazepam, promedol and diazepam, fentanyl and diazepam, fentanyl and sombrevin in 120 patients operated on the lungs with conventional and high-frequency jet ventilation. The studies have shown that in conventional controlled lung ventilation there were no distinctions in hemodynamic parameters depending on the type of the anesthesia. In high-frequency jet ventilation, specific hemodynamic effects of calypsol were observed. Unlike other anesthetics, calypsol administration is associated with elevated central venous pressure, increased cardiac output and enhanced left ventricular work, which can be accounted for by higher venous return.", 
    "39": "The effects of anesthetic premedication with diazepam and phentanyl on the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) were monitored with a pulsioximeter (BIOX 3700, Ohmeda) in 83 patients scheduled for traumatologic and orthopedic surgery who had baseline SpO2 higher than 95%. Premedication was carried out with phentanyl (0.1 mg) and diazepam (2.5 mg increments) until a somnolence state (eye closure), reversible with verbal stimuli, was achieved. The patients were breathing room air during the study. Premedication induced a significant reduction of SpO2 (p less than 0.001) from baseline values of 96.6 +/- 1.2% to 92.7 +/- 2.9% after sedation and to minimal values of 85.9 +/- 6.1%. In 60 patients (72.3%), minimal SpO2 was lower than 90%, and it was lower than 85% in 32 (38.8%). However, 34 of them (73.3%) recovered a SpO2 higher than 90% with verbal respiratory stimuli, but 16 (26.7%) only did so with oxygen administration. Cyanosis was not detected in any case. Minimal saturation was significantly correlated with baseline SpO2, age and smoking habit. Pulsioximetric monitoring or, if not available, routine oxygen administration, are recommended in patients undergoing pharmacological sedation.", 
    "40": "We present a female patient of 48 years with downbeat nystagmus (DBN), moderate impairment of coordination testing and a family history of cerebellar ataxia. We report that a single 2 mg dose of clonazepam (following Currie & Matsuo) resulted in a virtual disappearance of nystagmus and of the patient's symptom of oscillopsia. This result is interpreted in terms of current models of DBN.", 
    "41": "The purpose of this study was to measure gastric emptying by using the cumulative fraction absorbed-time profiles of paracetamol. To evaluate the validity of the method as an index of gastric emptying, six healthy male volunteers were entered into an ethically approved trial using different regimens of cholinergic enhancing (i.e. metoclopramide and neostigmine) and blocking agents (i.e. atropine and pirenzepine) and the results were compared with the bioavailability (i.e. Cmax, Tmax, AUC) parameters of paracetamol as an index of gastric emptying. The cumulative fractional absorption of paracetamol appears to be a valuable index for the measurement of gastric emptying.", 
    "42": "The influence of diazepam on the antinociceptive effect of morphine was studied using four different nociceptive tests in mice. In the tail flick test, diazepam induced a dose-dependent reduction of the morphine effect, with an almost total reversed morphine effect following diazepam 2 mg/kg. The effect could not be explained by altered tail skin temperature or pharmacokinetic changes. Diazepam 1 mg/kg and higher induced sedation and significantly impaired the performance in a rotarod test, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg diazepam was therefore used in the other nociceptive tests. This dose of diazepam significantly attenuated the antinociceptive effect of morphine in the constant temperature hot plate test and the tail flick test. In the increasing temperature hot plate test and in the formalin test, no effect of diazepam on the nociceptive effect of morphine was observed. The results indicate that diazepam antagonizes the effect of morphine dependent upon the test employed. No antagonism could be observed in tests with a long-lasting stimulus, and a response integration probably at a rather high level in the CNS. In the two tests showing antagonism, the stimulus is more short-lasting, and at least for the tail flick test, the integration takes place at a lower level in the CNS.", 
    "43": "Cultured glial cells were exposed to ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) at varying concentrations. Studies of the exposed glial cells were performed at days 29 and 36 post-conceptional age (culture days 8 and 15). In addition to morphologic studies, biochemical assays including [3H]-flunitrazepam (FLU) specific binding, Ro5-4864-displaceable 3H-FLU binding, and protein determinations were performed. At day 29 post-conceptional age, significant decreases in 3H-FLU specific binding, Ro5-4864-displaceable 3H-FLU binding, and protein determinations were discernible only in the presence of 100 microM Fe-NTA. At day 36 post-conceptional age 3H-FLU specific binding was significantly decreased at 20, 60, and 100 microM Fe-NTA concentrations, while Ro5-4864-displaceable 3H-FLU binding and protein determinations were significantly reduced at 60 and 100 microM Fe-NTA concentrations. The effects of Fe-NTA exposure appear to be both concentration and duration-of-exposure related. When compared to previously reported neuronal cell culture studies utilizing 3H-FLU specific binding, Ro5-4864-displaceable 3H-FLU binding, and protein determinations, glial cells appear to be significantly more resistant to chelated iron exposure.", 
    "44": "Alfentanil was used as an adjuvant to midazolam for analgesia in thirty outpatients undergoing colonoscopy. A similar group of thirty outpatients received fentanyl. The operating conditions and recovery times of the two groups were compared. Alfentanil usage resulted in better operating conditions. Recovery time was similar. Patient acceptance was high. No patient suffered respiratory depression during or after the procedure.", 
    "45": "A double-blind study consisting of 339 randomly selected children investigated the effects of several premedicants on the preoperative and postoperative behaviour of children who underwent day-stay surgery. Patients were allocated into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 165 children aged between 6 and 47 months. Group 2 consisted of 174 children aged four years and older to a body weight of 50 kg. Each child received one premedicant. Both groups included alprazolam 0.005 mg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and placebo. In addition Group 1 included chloral hydrate 40 mg/kg and Group 2 diazepam 0.25 mg/kg. Chloral hydrate produced superior conditions (more patients calm or asleep) at induction of anaesthesia. Postoperative behaviour and incidence of vomiting were similar for all drugs. No premedicant reduced anxiety in the older group. The time to awaken postoperatively with diazepam was longer than with placebo. Alprazolam and midazolam were unpalatable for children over four years and conferred no advantage over placebo.", 
    "46": "Continuous subcutaneous infusion of cholecystokinin (CCK-8; 5 micrograms/kg/h) to rats for 7 weeks raised the plasma CCK concentration almost fivefold and increased the pancreatic weight by about 50% but was without effect on the gastrointestinal tract. Continuous subcutaneous infusion of the CCK antagonist L-364,718 (200 micrograms/kg/h) for 7 weeks reduced the weight of the pancreas by about 30% but was without effect on the gastrointestinal tract. The effect of continuous subcutaneous infusion of CCK-8 and L-364,718 in combination was very similar to that of L-364,718 alone. Pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD) induced a nearly 10-fold increase in the plasma CCK concentration 3 and 7 weeks after the operation. The serum gastrin values were unaffected. The weight of the pancreas was more than doubled after 7 weeks. At the same time the small intestine had gained weight, but the colon was unaffected. Continuous subcutaneous infusion of L-364,718 prevented the effect of PBD on the pancreas. On the basis of the assumption that L-364,718 is a specific antagonist of CCK, we conclude that endogenous CCK has a trophic effect on the pancreas but not on the gastrointestinal tract and that it is essential for normal pancreatic growth.", 
    "47": "Fifteen healthy children 2-10 years old and scheduled for elective surgery, received midazolam 0.35 mg/kg body weight and atropine 0.025 mg/kg as rectal premedication about 35 min before the induction of anesthesia. The induction itself was carried out in a separate and quiet room next to the operating theatre by rectal administration of ketamine 10 mg/kg and midazolam 0.2 mg/kg. With the children breathing spontaneously, anesthesia was maintained by repetitive i.v. bolus injections of ketamine. The sedative and anticholinergic effects of the premedication were satisfactory. Induction of anesthesia was smooth. Consciousness was lost after 9-15 (mean 13) min. No significant adverse effects on hemodynamics or respiration were noted. Recovery from anesthesia was uneventful. No cases of rectal irritation or unpleasant dreams were reported. Post-operative analgesia was good. In conclusion, rectal administration of midazolam and atropine for premedication, followed by ketamine and midazolam for the induction of anesthesia, proved to be a pleasant, safe, and reliable method in pediatric anesthesia.", 
    "48": "Because of the increase of illicit drug use within the inner city--and especially because of the increasing popularity of cocaine--Michigan Health Center (Detroit) implemented a policy of routine drug screening of all patients admitted to the hospital through the labor unit. This policy was first implemented in February 1989. Routine drug screening made it possible to perform a retrospective study of the prevalence and patterns of drug abuse in a population consisting predominantly of inner-city patients of minority origin and indigent circumstance. The data derived from drug screening on 290 patients performed over a 75-day period are evaluated. Urine samples were screened for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates. Nearly 27% of the urine samples tested positive for one or more of these substances. Cannabinoids and cocaine were found most frequently. Mandatory drug screening of pregnant patients by inner-city hospitals may be warranted. No statistically significant difference was noted (P less than or equal to .05) with respect to the average age, education, and number of prenatal visits of illicit substance users compared with those of nonusers.", 
    "49": "We have studied the effect of i.v. midazolam on median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in 10 unpremedicated adults. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam by bolus administration (0.2 mg kg-1) followed by infusion (5 mg h-1). The latency and amplitudes of the SSEP responses over the second cervical vertebrae (SC2) and sensory cortex (P17, N20, P25) were recorded before and for 10 min after induction. Data were analysed over that period for time-related alterations. Small but statistically significant increases in latency of the cortical N20 (P less than 0.005) and P25 (P less than 0.001) waves and interwave conduction times of SC2 to P25 (P less than 0.005) and N20 to P25 (P less than 0.021) were observed. Cortical amplitude (N20-P25) decreased significantly (P less than 0.012), to approximately 60% of baseline. These results demonstrated that midazolam produced a depression of cortical SSEP amplitude without clinically significant alterations in latency.", 
    "50": "Arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation was prospectively monitored in 103 consecutive patients undergoing office colonoscopy to determine the incidence of any clinical characteristics which might predict arterial desaturation to less than 90%. Baseline saturations were obtained prior to premedications and continuously during the examination using a finger mounted pulse oximeter. Intravenous premedication regimens varied from none to a maximal dose of 50 mg of meperidine and 10 mg of diazepam. All colonoscopies included cecal intubation and were performed by one investigator employing a video colonoscope. The incidence of desaturation was 41% without significant variation among the sedation groups. Age was positively correlated with desaturation (p less than 0.05). Sex, obesity, history of lung or heart disease, chronic cardiac medications, and baseline saturation percentage failed to be sensitive predictors of desaturation. No parameter could be correlated with prolongation of desaturation below 90%. No adverse outcomes or complications were noted during the periendoscopy period, suggesting that oximetry monitoring during outpatient colonoscopy may not be clinically useful.", 
    "51": "This study compared how often oxygen desaturation occurred during conscious sedation for upper and lower procedures, the frequency and extent of desaturation occurring after sedation with diazepam plus meperidine to that occurring after midazolam plus meperidine, and the relationship between age or type of procedure (upper versus lower) with oxygen desaturation to less than 90%. Two-hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients undergoing elective upper or lower endoscopic procedures under conscious sedation had oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximeter before sedation, following sedation but prior to the procedure, and while sedated and undergoing the procedure. Forty-five percent of the subjects desaturated to less than 90% without demonstrating any clinical signs of distress, including 40% of those undergoing upper procedures and 54% of those undergoing lower procedures. Neither the age of the patient, the drugs used, drug doses used, nor the type of procedure accurately predicted which patients would desaturate to less than 90%. Potentially significant oxygen desaturation cannot be reliably predicted by clinical criteria. Pulse oximetry is far more sensitive than standard clinical monitoring practices in detecting oxygen desaturation.", 
    "52": "The disposition of midazolam was investigated in six patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and six age- and weight-matched healthy subjects by administering two single doses of the drug (3.75 mg i.v. and 7.5 mg p.o.) separated by 1 week. Serial blood samples were collected for 24 h after each dose and plasma was assayed for midazolam by GC-MS. In the CHF patients, the elimination half-life was prolonged (4 to 4.5 vs less than 3 h), the systemic clearance was lowered (376 vs 551 ml min-1) and the peak plasma drug concentration after the p.o. dose was higher (76 vs 42 ng ml-1). The systemic availability (45 vs 41%), the steady state volume of distribution (111 vs 108 l) and the time of peak plasma drug concentration after the p.o. dose (0.9 vs 0.9 h) were unchanged. The predominant effect of CHF was on the clearance of midazolam which was decreased by 30%. The drug was well tolerated and did not cause any adverse effects.", 
    "53": "From 1986 to 1989, the Chemical Dependency Recovery Program at Kaiser Permanente Hospital, Fontana, California, admitted an increasing number of patients for alprazolam dependence. Severe withdrawal reactions and adverse consequences with use were reported in the literature. In this review of 30 cases of alprazolam dependence and subsequent withdrawal, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of patient hospital days, the subjective symptoms, and staff time spent with patients compared with those in alcoholic controls. Most patients with diagnosed alprazolam dependence used doses in the range recommended by the package information at the time of admission. Patients with low preadmission doses of 1 mg or less per day showed notable withdrawal symptoms. The average duration of use was 29.9 months, considerably longer than suggested effective ranges. Most patients (28) had a chemical dependence history before being placed on alprazolam therapy; 24 had a positive family history of chemical dependence; and 24 had previous or current psychiatric care.", 
    "54": "Recently acquired data question the sharp dichotomy between anxiolytics and neuroleptics, since disinhibitory effects have been measured in the rat with very low doses of haloperidol and higher doses of atypical neuroleptics in FI and DRL schedules, but also in the open-field test. That the DA transmission in certain brain regions is involved in some aspects of anxiety has recently been suggested. The present study confirms this hypothesis particularly with high doses of sulpiride (80 mg/kg) and clozapine (24 mg/kg) when tested in the open-field test. Moreover, the results show how a slight chemical modification of clozapine can give a direction to pharmacological activity with one derivative still resembling clozapine and the second one resembling haloperidol. As neuroleptics do not seem to influence the synthesis and utilization of GABA, the higher entry score observed with them would seem to depend above all on DA antagonism in the mesolimbic system.", 
    "55": "Stress desensitization is observed as a decrease in the disruptive effects of a stressor on behavior when the organism is repeatedly exposed to the stressor. For instrumental behavior, stress desensitization was also reported for rats preexposed to anxiogenic drugs; stress sensitization was reported for rats preexposed to an anxiolytic compound. The present study investigated whether similar effects are found in a noninstrumental task situation. First, rats received 12 daily injections of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 20 mg/kg, IP), diazepam (DZP, 5 mg/kg, IP) or saline. After each injection the effect of the drugs on the acoustic startle reflex was measured. No drugs were given during the remainder of the experiment. Eight days later rats were given 5 days of Pavlovian fear conditioning to establish a light as a shock signal. During the next 3 days, potentiation of the startle response by the light was measured. None of the drug treatments had an effect on startle potentiation, indicating that stress sensitivity is not affected by previous administration of PTZ and DZP in a noninstrumental task. An explanation for the different effects found for instrumental and noninstrumental tasks is suggested.", 
    "56": "Perinatal exposure to diazepam has been shown to lead to alterations in motor activity and exploratory behavior in neonatal animals. Exploratory and locomotor behavior have been associated with changes in mesotelencephalic dopamine function. We have therefore examined the effects of perinatal diazepam administration on both exploratory behavior and mesotelencephalic dopamine turnover in the adult rat. Animals exposed to the benzodiazepine during the perinatal period engaged in significantly less exploratory behavior than did control subjects. The diazepam-induced alterations in behavior were developmentally specific: decreased exploratory behavior was observed at 90, but not 60, days of age. At 90 days of age, specific changes in dopamine turnover in diazepam-treated animals were restricted to mesolimbic (nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area) sites; alterations in dopamine turnover were not seen in other mesotelencephalic sites examined. The findings indicate that perinatal exposure to benzodiazepines leads to behavioral changes that are present in adulthood. These changes in exploratory behavior may be associated with alterations in mesolimbic dopamine function.", 
    "57": "The authors are reporting a case of koro syndrome which was associated with major depression. Koro syndrome is a rare disease which manifests itself with a severe anxiety associated with the fear of having the penis shrinking and disappearing in the abdomen. The case reported was treated with trimipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, at a dose of 150 mg/day associated with bromazepam, a benzodiazepine. In addition, the patient received psychotherapy, which allowed him to deal with the situation and to eliminate guilt feelings. It is hypothesized that the tricyclic antidepressant, by treating the depression, had a curative effect on the koro syndrome.", 
    "58": "A model system is described in which sustained clonic seizures are produced by a combination of phenytoin (PHT) and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in the mouse, the former agent preventing the terminal tonic spasms produced by the latter. In this system, midazolam (MDL), a water-soluble benzodiazepine, was compared with diazepam (DZP), a sparingly soluble agent which is widely used to treat status epilepticus (SE) in humans. Both agents were administered intramuscularly (i.m.) in approximately equieffective doses in animals exhibiting clonic seizure activity. MDL proved to be about twice as potent as DZP. Whereas control animals convulsed for a period of approximately 90 min, those treated with DZP 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg convulsed for 7.8 and 3.9 min, respectively; mice receiving MDL 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg convulsed for 1.9 and 1.4 min, respectively. MDL arrested seizures substantially more rapidly than diazepam (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that MDL has sufficiently rapid anticonvulsant action to merit evaluation for control of SE in humans when a rapidly absorbed antiepileptic drug (AED) is needed and intravenous (i.v.) administration is not feasible.", 
    "59": "Homocysteine thiolactone (HTL) elicits seizures in mice at a dose of 850 mg/kg (95-100% of animals) with an average latency time of 19.5 min. These seizures are reversed by both 5' N-ethylcarboximide adenosine (NECA) and flunitrazepam, with respective ED50 doses of 0.025 and 0.20 mg/kg. NECA was approximately four-fold more potent as an inhibitor of HTL-induced seizures than of seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 75 mg/kg). Flunitrazepam was equipotent in both seizure paradigms. The purine precursor 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside, (AICAr), although virtually ineffective against PTZ-induced seizures at doses greater than 1 g/kg, was able to inhibit HTL-induced seizures with an ED50 of approximately 350 mg/kg. The anticonvulsant effect of AICAr was dose and time dependent. The anticonvulsant potency of AICAr was increased by simultaneous administration of the adenosine uptake blocker Mioflazine, whereas the central nervous system (CNS)-impermeable adenosine uptake blocker dipyridamole had no effect. The ability of AICAr to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is limited (less than 1%) and may explain its low potency as an anticonvulsant. AICAr also has very low potency at brain adenosine A1 and A2 receptors as well as adenosine uptake sites (IC50 greater than 10(-3) M), suggesting that its anticonvulsant properties are not mediated by direct action at these sites. The results indicate that AICAr does have frank anticonvulsant effects and further suggest that HTL-induced seizures may represent a useful paradigm for evaluation of adenosinergic agents. AICAr or more potent derivatives thereof may represent a new class of anticonvulsants with the ability to target seizure foci selectively.", 
    "60": "The effects of propofol 2 mg/kg, methohexital 2 mg/kg or midazolam 0.3 mg/kg were studied on the QT interval of the ECG corrected by the heart rate (QTc), heart rate and arterial pressure during induction of anaesthesia in 87 ASA class I-(II)-patients. The patients were randomly allocated to one of the three anaesthetic groups. The incidence of the patients with a prolonged QTc interval (= more than 440 ms) ranged from 29 to 41% between the groups. In each group these patients were treated separately. After all anaesthetics, the QTc interval was significantly prolonged in the patients with a normal control QTc interval, whereas in the patients with a prolonged control QTc interval, it tended to be shortened both after propofol and methohexital and it was significantly shortened after midazolam. After injection of suxamethonium, no significant QTc interval changes occurred in the patients with a normal control QTc interval in either the propofol or the methohexital groups, whereas in the patients with a prolonged control QTc interval treated with propofol the QTc interval decreased significantly 60 s after suxamethonium when compared with the corresponding preceding values. The mean values in the propofol group in the patients with a normal control QTc interval were always below the upper limit of the normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Atropine-induced heart rate (HR) changes were studied in 19 patients (ASA physical status I) during anaesthesia-maintained predominantly with propofol-N2O or thiopentone-enflurane-N2O. Ten patients (Group A) received midazolam (0.07 mg.kg-1), fentanyl (1 microgram.kg-1), propofol (2 mg.kg-1) and succinylcholine (1 mg.kg-1). Following tracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with propofol (6 mg.kg-1.hr-1), N2O (67 per cent) and O2 (33 per cent). In nine patients (Group B) thiopentone (4 mg.kg-1) was substituted for propofol and anaesthesia maintained with N2O (67 per cent) O2 (33 per cent), and enflurane (0.5 per cent inspired concentration). The study was non-randomised because Group B patients were only included if HR before administration of atropine less than 90 beats.min-1. IPPV was performed in all patients using a Manley ventilator (minute vol. 85 ml.kg-1; tidal vol. 7 ml.kg-1). Ten minutes after tracheal intubation, incremental doses of atropine (equivalent cumulative doses: 1.8, 3.6, 7.2, 14.4, 28.8 micrograms.kg-1) were administered at two-minute intervals and HR responses calculated during the last 45 sec of each intervening period. No differences were observed between the groups following 1.8 and 3.6 micrograms.kg-1 atropine, but propofol-N2O anaesthesia was associated with reduced responses (P less than 0.01) following 7.2, 14.4 and 28.8 micrograms.kg-1 atropine. These results suggest that there is a predominance of parasympathetic influences during propofol-N2O anaesthesia compared with thiopentone-enflurane-N2O anaesthesia.", 
    "62": "The goal of this study was to use a functional bioassay to compare muscarinic receptors in two vascular preparations: the rabbit ear artery, which manifests an endothelial-dependent relaxation to cholinergic stimulation, and the bovine coronary artery, in which contraction is elicited independently of the endothelium. Four antagonists were selected, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide, dicyclomine, methoctramine and hexahydrosiladifenidol, to complement previous studies using pirenzepine and 11,2- ([2-(diethylaminomethyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one, in order to distinguish M1, M2 and M3 receptors. All the antagonists produced competitive inhibition of responses to methacholine, with Schild plot slopes not different from one, with one exception: for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide, Schild plot slopes were greater than one in both tissues. Comparison of antagonist affinities suggests that the muscarinic receptor subtype is not different between the two tissues, despite the different cell types that mediate these responses. Furthermore, the pattern of antagonist affinity agrees most closely with that found previously for the M3 receptor, with high affinity for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide, hexahydrosiladifenidol and dicyclomine, intermediate affinity for pirenzepine, and low affinity for 11,2- ([2-(diethylaminomethyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one and methoctramine. These findings demonstrate that currently available muscarinic antagonists do not discriminate between receptors found on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, even though the ultimate responses produced are opposed.", 
    "63": "Clinical observations of 37 alprazolam-dependent patients are presented. Seventeen inpatients and 20 outpatients, the majority suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, were withdrawn from alprazolam by means of clonazepam substitution in an open-label fashion. Two patients experienced rebound panic symptoms; true withdrawal syndromes were not observed. Although the limitations of an open series are evident, it was found that this method of discontinuation is safe and effective and, in particular, does not pose a danger of withdrawal seizures.", 
    "64": "Eight patients with combat-induced chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) receiving long-term alprazolam therapy for anxiety or depression (maximum dose of 2-9 mg/day for 1-5 years) had alprazolam therapy withdrawn. Most of the patients underwent gradual medication withdrawal. All patients had a prior history of alcohol abuse or benzodiazepine dependence. During withdrawal, all patients had severe reactions including anxiety, sleep disturbance, rage reactions, hyperalertness, increased nightmares, and intrusive thoughts; and 6 of the 8 patients had homicidal ideation. As a result of this report, the authors suggest that the potential for severe withdrawal reactions, even with gradual tapering, should be considered before prescribing alprazolam therapy for this group of patients.", 
    "65": "Cerebral infarction, headache, and hypertension are well-known complications of carotid endarectomy (CEA). Seizures are a less frequent, but important complication. We describe eight patients with focal and generalized seizures following CEA. Seizures occurred 6 to 13 days after CEA. All began as focal motor seizures contralateral to the side of the CEA, and six patients developed generalized tonoclonic seizures. Lorazepam and phenytoin sodium controlled the seizures. Five patients without evidence of stroke on computed tomographic scan were normal in follow-up and had no further seizures. The other three patients had mild deficits. One developed a chronic seizure disorder. The pathogenesis of this syndrome following CEA remains unclear, but may involve cerebral hyperperfusion, cerebral embolization, or both.", 
    "66": "Mixed venous oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SvO2) and mixed venous oxygen tension (PvO2) may reflect the overall balance between oxygen consumption and delivery. Because of the potential value of monitoring SvO2 and PvO2 as indications of the state of tissue oxygenation, the aim of this study was to determine, during normoxic acute isovolemic hemodilution in pigs, the critical PvO2, critical SvO2, and critical oxygen extraction ratio (ER) at which oxygen uptake starts to decline during further induced hemodilution. During stepwise induced isovolemic hemodilution, a gradual decline in SvO2 and PvO2 was observed in all animals. The mean +/- SD of the critical PvO2 of six animals was 32.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg. The mean +/- SD of the critical SvO2 was 44.2% +/- 7.9%. The ER increased gradually. At an ER of 0.57 +/- 0.08, oxygen uptake started to decline. A significant correlation was found between changes in SvO2 and changes in ER. These degrees of hemodilution were accompanied by an increase in cardiac index, pulmonary wedge pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular stroke work index. Only a slight decrease in systemic vascular resistance was observed. We conclude that measurements of PvO2 and SvO2 can be used as indicators of the critical point of hemodilution and that the SvO2 during hemodilution reflects the overall balance between oxygen uptake and oxygen delivery, confirmed by the strong correlation found between SvO2 and oxygen extraction ratio.", 
    "67": "The procedures involved in cerebral and medullary embolization produce special problems for the anesthesiologist. Some imperatives must be followed in order to minimize the high neuroradiological risks associated with these long and repetitive procedures. The first of these imperatives is sedation, which throughout the procedure should be sufficient, although not narcotic enough to prevent neurological evaluations. The use of a benzodiazepine (Midazolam) in conjunction with an analgesic (Alfentanil) that is rapidly eliminated answers this need. The prescription of vasodilatator agents depends on the location of the embolization. Calcium channel blockers should be used following embolism of the internal carotid while nitrate derivatives are recommended after embolism of the external carotid. Reduction of the risk of thrombosis is accomplished by perfusion with anti-sludge or, with exception to therapeutic procedures involving hemostasis, by perfusion with acetylsalicylic acid. Following evaluation of 105 procedures in 75 patients it is concluded that this sedation produces reliable results and allows the procedure to be performed with maximal security.", 
    "68": "Midazolam perfusion associated to fentanyl injections induces a sedation sufficient to allow balloon progression through vessels as far as aneurysm, an often long procedure, even for very anxious or neurological damaged patients. At the same time, sedation lightening as well as specific antagonists naloxone or flumazenil can reverse such a sedation to permit a reliable neurological examination after the balloon dilatation which is necessary too. Nevertheless this sedation requires to take great care to install patient and to use a tele-monitoring.", 
    "69": "The effect of food on the rate and extent of bioavailability of bromazepam was examined in seven normal volunteers following a single oral dose of 10 mg bromazepam with 200 ml of water in the fasting and non-fasting states. Plasma concentrations of bromazepam were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. A tmax value in a non-fasting state was prolonged from 2.3 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 2.8 +/- 0.6 h but not significantly different (p greater than 0.05) whereas a Cmax value was significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased from 259 +/- 12.7 (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 169 +/- 13.9 ng/ml. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve in the non-fasting state was also significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased from 1844 +/- 145 (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 1233 +/- 98.1 ng.h/ml after oral administration of bromazepam.", 
    "70": "Acetylcholine-induced guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle contraction and epithelium-derived relaxant factor release were evaluated using guinea-pig open tracheal rings and rat anococcygeus muscle bioassay to get insight into the participation of muscarinic receptor subtypes in these responses. There was a significant difference between the two pA2 values obtained in contraction and relaxation experiments for pirenzepine, but no difference was found either for atropine or for 4-DAMP. This difference seems to be due to the participation of M1-receptors in smooth muscle contraction.", 
    "71": "Reduction of nitro-substituted 1,2-dihydro-3H-1,3-benzodiazepine-2-ones by E. coli cells immobilized in carrageenan was studied. The corresponding amines are the sole products with a 100% yield as compared to the native cells. Conditions for immobilization of E. coli cells in the home-produced carrageenan was worked out: the cell to carrageenan ratio is 1:10 (w/w), granulation in toluene at 0-(+)4 degrees, treatment with 0.3-0.4 M KCl. The carrageenan-immobilized cells are stable upon storage, repeated usage (after 10 cycles about 80% of the initial activity is retained), and when being used in column fermenters.", 
    "72": "The effects of midazolam on stress response during surgery compared with thiamylal were studied. Twelve patients were divided into 2 groups at random; midazolam group and thiamylal group. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 or thiamylal 4 mg.kg-1 in each group, and maintained with O2 2 l.min-1, N2O 4 l.min-1 and enflurane. The plasma concentration of catecholamine was measured at preinduction, 10, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after intubation. No significant differences were seen between 2 groups in plasma concentration of catecholamine. In midazolam group, plasma concentration of epinephrine decreased significantly 10 minutes after intubation as compared with preinduction level. The plasma concentration of norepinephrine in midazolam group tended to decrease. In thiamylal group, plasma concentration of norepinephrine tended to increase and increased significantly at 120 and 180 minutes after intubation as compared with preinduction level. These results suggest that induction with midazolam suppresses stress response during anesthetic induction and surgery more intensely than induction with thiamylal.", 
    "73": "Strychnine poisoning is an unusual but dramatic poisoning in which convulsions are the major threat to life. Convulsions are predominantly at the spinal level, and the key to recognition of this poisoning is observation of convulsive activity in the awake patient without a postictal phase. Successful treatment requires aggressive airway control and treatment of seizures with benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Neuromuscular blockade may be required. Gastrointestinal decontamination is usually indicated in recent acute ingestions but may precipitate convulsions. Recovery from strychnine poisoning is usually complete and rapid if treatment is aggressive. In the absence of trauma, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, or anoxic central nervous system injury, no neurologic or musculoskeletal sequelae are expected. Confirmation of strychnine poisoning is best obtained by submitting urine or gastric aspirate for analysis utilizing a qualitative test such as thin layer chromatography (TLC).", 
    "74": "In two experiments, a recognition test for an earlier presented list was given twice in immediate succession (Test 1 and Test 2). On the hypothesis that anterograde amnesia for episodic memory involves a deficit in contextual memory, amnesic subjects should confuse familiarity with distractor items gained during Test 1 with familiarity gained during original list presentation. As a result, they should think that they recognize more items on Test 2. This will lower recognition efficiency in Test 2 by increasing false alarms rather than by reducing hits. For subjects with an amnesia induced by lorazepam, but not for control subjects, recognition efficiency was substantially reduced in Test 2 in both experiments. As predicted, this impairment was due to a large increase in false alarms, with no decrease in the number of hits. The impairment could not be explained by a difference in recognition level between lorazepam and control subjects on Test 1. These findings therefore support the contextual memory deficit hypothesis of anterograde amnesia. Their implications for understanding the relationship between recall and recognition in amnesia are discussed.", 
    "75": "The authors analyzed the relative contributions of improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HRSA), respectively, after 1 week of treatment to the prediction of improvement in HRSD score after 6 weeks of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Fifty-six subjects completed 6 weeks of treatment with either desipramine (n = 20), alprazolam (n = 18), or a desipramine-alprazolam combination (n = 18). The results showed that early improvement in the HRSD was a moderately strong predictor of the total 6-week improvement in HRSD score, and a better predictor than early improvement in the HRSA. Partial correlations showed that early HRSD improvement was significantly related to total HRSD improvement within the alprazolam group. This pattern of response differed from those observed for the other treatment groups. Desipramine-treated subjects showed gradual improvement over the course of the study, and the improvement in week 1 was not so strongly predictive of overall improvement. The relationship between early and total HRSD improvement for the combination treatment group was intermediate to the other two groups. These findings are discussed in the context of the relationship between depression and anxiety, and potential implications for the treatment of these overlapping and often mixed syndromes."
