However, most NHP studies are conducted under anesthesia, which affects the interpretability of receptor binding measures. The aims of this study were to develop awake NHP imaging with minimal head restraint and to compare in vivo binding of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)-benzodiazepine radiotracer (11)C-flumazenil under anesthetized and awake conditions. We hypothesized that (11)C-flumazenil binding potential (BPND) would be higher in isoflurane-anesthetized monkeys.", 
    "1": "The small animal PET scanner was fitted to a mechanical device that raised and tilted the scanner 45\u00b0 while the awake NHP was tilted back 35\u00b0 in a custom chair for optimal brain positioning, which required acclimation of the animals to the chair, touch-screen tasks, intravenous catheter insertion, and tilting. For PET studies, the bolus-plus-constant infusion method was used for (11)C-flumazenil administration. Two rhesus monkeys were scanned under the awake (n = 6 scans) and isoflurane-anesthetized (n = 4 scans) conditions. An infrared camera was used to track head motion during PET scans. Under the awake condition, emission and head motion-tracking data were acquired for 40-75 min after injection. Anesthetized monkeys were scanned for 90 min. Cortisol measurements were acquired during awake and anesthetized scans. Equilibrium analysis was used for both the anesthetized (n = 4) and the awake (n = 5) datasets to compute mean BPND images in NHP template space, using the pons as a reference region. The percentage change per minute in radioactivity concentration was calculated in high- and low-binding regions to assess the quality of equilibrium.",

The relationship between awake and anesthetized values was BPND (awake) = 0.94 BPND (anesthetized) + 0.36 (r(2) = 0.95). Cortisol levels were significantly higher under the awake condition (P < 0.05).",

Subject data were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. Linear regression equations, derived from partial AUCs, were developed from training set data. Predicted CLORAL was determined from these equations from validation set data. Preset criterion was a coefficient of determination (r2) greater than or equal to 0.9. Bias and precision were evaluated by relative percent mean prediction error (%MPE) and relative percent mean absolute error (%MAE).",

Formulations containing a mixture of medium-chain triglycerides and soybean oil as oil phase, lecithin (soybean/egg) and polysorbate 80 as emulsifiers, and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 8) as aqueous phase were prepared by cold high-pressure homogenization. To study the effects of the oil content, lecithin type, and the presence of diazepam as a model drug and their interactions on physicochemical characteristics of nanoemulsions, a three factor two-level full factorial design was applied. The nanoemulsions were evaluated concerning droplet size and size distribution, surface charge, viscosity, morphology, drug-excipient interactions, and physical stability. The characterization revealed the small spherical droplets in the range 195 -220 nm with polydispersity index below 0.15 and zeta potential between -30 and - 60 mV. Interactions among the investigated factors, rather than factors alone, were shown to more profoundly affect nanoemulsion characteristics. In vivo pharmacokinetic study of selected diazepam nanoemulsions with different oil content (20%, 30%, and 40%, w/w) demonstrated fast and intense initial distribution into rat brain of diazepam from nanoemulsions with 20% and 30% (w/w) oil content, suggesting their applicability in urgent situations.", 
    "9": "We report one Chinese patient with neurosyphilis exhibiting periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The patient (male, 59 years old) manifested with progressive cognitive decline and abnormal behavior. After several days, he gradually lost contact with others, and fell into a coma. EEG revealed periodic abnormal waves, predominantly located in the right anterior frontal region. The serum and cerebrospinal fluid Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay were positive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed focal atrophy in the right frontal and temporal region. Diffusion-weighted MRI showed \"lace sign\" in cortex, which could be seen as an early and special feature in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). To differentiate \"PLEDs of neurosyphilis on EEG\" from \"periodic synchronous discharges (PSD) of CJD on EEG,\" we treated this patient with diazepam 20 mg intravenously. After 10 minutes, periodic abnormal waves on EEG disappeared, with improved mental status, which confirmed the diagnosis of PLEDs of neurosyphilis. Then, after the treatment with penicillin, the patient improved and returned to work.", 
    "10": "Our review describes potential weight-altering effects of psychotropic medications (antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, mood stabilizers, sedative-hypnotics, medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other psychotropic medications) and offers guidance on switching a medication if its weight-altering effect becomes problematic. For second-generation antipsychotics, the risk of weight gain is high with clozapine and olanzapine, low with amisulpride, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone, and medium with other second-generation antipsychotics. Switching from a high-risk antipsychotic to a low-risk antipsychotic usually mitigates or reverses weight gain. For second-generation antidepressants, there may be modest weight loss with bupropion and modest weight gain with mirtazapine and paroxetine. Other second-generation antidepressants are weight neutral but individual variations can occur. If significant change in weight occurs, switching to or adding a low-risk second-generation antidepressant should be considered. Mood stabilizers include lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and most second-generation antipsychotics. Risk of weight gain is high with lithium and valproate and low with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine. Given the complexity of bipolar disorder and its management, a switch of a mood stabilizer would be best done by a psychiatrist. Benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine and melatonergic hypnotics, doxepin, and trazodone are weight neutral. Diphenhydramine may cause weight-gain and can be switched to a weight-neutral hypnotic if needed. Stimulants can cause varying degrees of weight loss and switching to atomoxetine or bupropion may reverse this problem. If that fails, switching to clonidine or guanfacine can be tried. Switching must be evidence-based and take into account status of the condition being treated, efficacy, side effect profile, potential drug-drug interactions, required laboratory monitoring and cost of the drug(s) being considered, and patient's pregnancy status or plan. Non-pharmacological interventions both for mental disorders and overweight/obesity must be fully availed.",

    "15": "Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Taurine and glutathione (GSH) have antioxidant and central nervous system protective properties, and are proposed to be involved in the pathology of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to compare the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of taurine and GSH in patients with schizophrenia, medicated with oral olanzapine, compared with controls. In total, 37 patients with schizophrenia and 45 healthy volunteers were recruited. We found the plasma taurine levels to be elevated in patients compared with controls. No differences were, however, found between patients and controls regarding taurine in CSF or GSH concentrations in plasma and CSF. Moreover, in the patient group no correlations between taurine and GSH levels and the symptoms or function of the disorder were found. The higher levels of plasma but not CSF taurine in patients with schizophrenia treated with OLA may implicate the involvement of taurine in the pathophysiology of the disease. The absence of GSH differences both in plasma and CSF between patients and controls is interesting in the perspective of earlier research proposing a dysregulation of GSH metabolism as a vulnerability factor for the development of schizophrenia.", 
    "16": "Application of a single dose of a central nervous system (CNS) active drug with a defined single mode of action has been proven useful to explore and characterize the pharmacophysiological properties of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of motor cortical and corticospinal excitability in humans. With this pharmaco-TMS approach, it was demonstrated that different TMS measures reflect axon excitability (motor threshold), or inhibitory (cortical silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, short-latency afferent inhibition) or excitatory synaptic excitability (motor evoked potential amplitude, intracortical facilitation, short-interval intracortical facilitation) of distinct neuronal elements in the CNS. Pharmaco-TMS has opened an exciting window into human cortical physiology. The array of pharmacophysiologically well defined TMS measures is now used by neurologists, psychiatrists, and clinical neurophysiologists for diagnosis or treatment monitoring in neuropsychiatric disease. This chapter reviews systematically the TMS measures of motor cortical and corticospinal excitability from the perspective of pharmacophysiological characterization. For example, it is demonstrated that blockers of voltage-gated sodium channels specifically increase motor threshold but do not alter other TMS measures of excitability, whereas positive modulators at \u03b3-butyric acid (GABA) type A receptors, such as benzodiazepines, enhance short-interval intracortical inhibition and depress motor evoked potential amplitude but have no effect on motor threshold.",

All the victims had just arrived in Brussels through one of the main rail station of the town and were admitted via the emergency ambulance service from different locations in the centre of Brussels around the CHU Saint-Pierre Hospital. Haemodynamic parameters upon admission were within normal limits. The Glasgow Coma Scale was equal or higher than 9/15 in 14 of the 16 victims. Toxicology screening obtained in 12 patients revealed the presence of flunitrazepam, which was further quantified at levels ranging from 21 to 75\u00a0\u03bcg/l. One of the Japanese patients, who returned to Belgium afterwards for professional reasons, was approached by the police and accepted to press charges. This allowed the police to investigate and send undercover agents to the railway station on Friday afternoons and evenings. They found a person who was offering welcome cookies to Asian travellers. He arrived from Amsterdam and returned once his crime was committed. Flunitrazepam is well known as a rape drug. We report a series of victims in whom flunitrazepam was used to facilitate robbery.",

    "30": "Background. Psychotropic medications, in particular second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and benzodiazepines, have been associated with harm in elderly populations. Health agencies around the world have issued warnings about the risks of prescribing such medications to frail individuals affected by dementia and current guidelines recommend their use only in cases where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. This study documents the use of psychotropic medications in the entire elderly population of a Canadian province in the context of current clinical guidelines for the treatment of behavioural disturbances. Methods. Prevalent and incident utilization of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and related medications (zopiclone and zaleplon) were determined in the population of Manitobans over age 65 in the time period 1997/98 to 2008/09 fiscal years. Comparisons between patients living in the community and those living in personal care (nursing) homes (PCH) were conducted. Influence of sociodemographic characteristics on prescribing was assessed by generalized estimating equations. Non-optimal use was defined as the prescribing of high dose of antipsychotic medications and the use of combination therapy of a benzodiazepine (or zopiclone/zaleplon) with an antipsychotic. A decrease in intensity of use over time and lower proportions of patients treated with antipsychotics at high dose or in combination with benzodiazepines (or zopiclone/zaleplon) was considered a trend toward better prescribing. Multiple regression analysis determined predictors of non-optimal use in the elderly population. Results. A 20-fold greater prevalent utilization of SGAs was observed in PCH-dwelling elderly persons compared to those living in the community. In 2008/09, 27% of PCH-dwelling individuals received a prescription for an SGA. Patient characteristics, such as younger age, male gender, diagnoses of dementia (or use of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) or psychosis in the year prior the prescription, were predictors of non-optimal prescribing (e.g., high dose antipsychotics). During the period 2002/3 and 2007/8, amongst new users of SGAs, 10.2% received high doses. Those receiving high dose antipsychotics did not show high levels of polypharmacy. Conclusions. Despite encouraging trends, the use of psychotropic medications remains high in elderly individuals, especially in residents of nursing homes. Clinicians caring for such patients need to carefully assess risks and benefits.", 
    "31": "GABAergic anxiolytics have well-documented centrally mediated side effects including sedation, potentiation of ethanol, tolerance, abuse liability and memory impairment. Most research directed towards identifying an anxioselective GABAergic therapeutic has been based upon the theory that these side effects could be mitigated by avoiding \u03b11/5-subunit GABAA receptors while specifically targeting those with the \u03b12/3-subunit. Unfortunately, there are prominent exceptions to this theory and it has yet to be translated into clinical success. We previously demonstrated that \u03b22/3-subunit-selective GABAA receptor-positive allosteric modulators act as anxiolytics with reduced sedation and ethanol potentiation regardless of their activity at \u03b11-subunit GABAA receptors. The prototypical \u03b22/3-subunit-selective positive allosteric modulator, 2-261, is further characterized here for additional side effects commonly associated with central GABAA receptor activation. In mice, 10 times the anxiolytic dose (10 mg/kg) of 2-261 does not induce behavioral tolerance in the elevated plus maze following a 2 week subchronic treatment. In rats, an anxiolytic dose (10 mg/kg) of 2-261 is inactive in conditioned place preference, suggesting a reduced abuse liability. In rats, 10 times the anxiolytic dose (100 mg/kg) of 2-261 does not have a significant amnestic effect in the radial arm maze, suggesting a greater therapeutic index for memory impairment. These results suggest that \u03b22/3-subunit subtype-selective GABAA receptor-positive allosteric modulators not only have reduced sedative liability, but also a reduction in other central side effects commonly associated with broader GABAA receptor activation. \u03b22/3-subunit-selective compounds may represent a novel design template for anxiolytics with benzodiazepine-like efficacy and mitigated side effects.",

In total, 19 healthy subjects, pre-screened for their responsiveness to the 7% CO2 test, took part in the randomised, double-blind, cross-over, incomplete block design study. After receiving treatment or placebo, the volunteers were subjected to three 7% CO2 challenges each for a time of 20 min. The treatment consisted of the administration of the following three active drugs: a single dose of benzodiazepine alprazolam (0.75 mg) and a single dose of the NK1 antagonists vestipitant (GW597599) (15 mg) and vofopitant (GR205171) (25 mg). Anxiety during the challenge was evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale-Anxiety (VAS-A) and with Panic Symptom List (PSL III-R). Respiratory parameters, heart rate and skin conductance were also recorded. Compared with placebo, vestipitant showed a significant reduction (p<0.05) in anxiety assessed on the VAS-A scale (\u0394VAS-A%) while alprazolam significantly (p<0.01) attenuated the PSL III-R total score.

Unfortunately, its therapeutic benefits are partly outweighed by significant weight gain and other metabolic side effects, which increase the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Because olanzapine remains superior to other antipsychotic drugs that show less weight gain liability, insight into the mechanisms responsible for olanzapine-induced weight gain is crucial if it is to be effectively addressed. Over the past few decades, several groups have investigated the effects of olanzapine on energy balance using rat models. Unfortunately, results from different studies have not always been consistent and it remains to be determined which paradigms should be used in order to model olanzapine-induced weight gain most accurately. This review summarizes the effects of olanzapine on energy balance observed in different rat models and discusses some of the factors that appear to contribute to the inconsistencies in observed effects. In addition it compares the effects reported in rats with clinical findings to determine the predictive validity of different paradigms.",

We evaluated plasma BDNF and associations with symptoms in 22 patients with TRD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of ketamine compared to an anaesthetic control (midazolam). Ketamine significantly increased plasma BDNF levels in responders compared to non-responders 240\u00a0min post-infusion, and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores were negatively correlated with BDNF (r=-0.701, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008).

Prospective longitudinal studies in medication-naive patients with a first episode of psychosis are a valuable source of information as they provide an assessment prior to the antipsychotic exposure and minimize the effect of potential confounding factors. The aim of this study was to assess the course of weight gain and the incidence of metabolic abnormalities during the first 3\u00a0yr of antipsychotic treatment. Data were collected from a cohort of 170 first-episode psychosis patients. They were randomly assigned to haloperidol (32%); olanzapine (32%) and risperidone (36%). The dose used was flexible. The initial antipsychotic treatment was changed when required, based on clinical response and tolerability. The results showed that the mean weight gain at 3\u00a0yr was 12.1\u00a0kg (s.d.\u00a0=\u00a010.7). It appeared to increase rapidly during the first year (85% of the total mean weight gain) and then stabilized gradually over time. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels followed a similar trajectory with a significant increase only during the first year. No significant changes were detected in the mean values of glycaemic parameters. Two patients with a family history of diabetes developed diabetes type II. At short-term the factors positively associated with weight gain were lower body mass index, male gender and olanzapine treatment. At long-term, functional status and clinical response were the main predictors. The results of our study indicate that the first year of antipsychotic treatment is a critical period for weight gain and metabolic changes. Identification of weight gain patterns may help to inform studies that aim to prevent or mitigate the metabolic adverse events associated with antipsychotic therapy.",

Nordazepam in the newborns' hair was detected at the mean level of 108.1\u00b1144.2 pg/mg. It was concluded that diazepam and nordazepam are permanently incorporated into the hair structure. Presence of diazepam and its metabolites in newborn's hair confirms that these benzodiazepines permeate placental barrier. Segmental analysis of mothers' hair enabled the assessment of drug administration time. Diazepam and its metabolites determined in hair of newborns may serve as biomarkers of prenatal exposure to these drugs. The performed LC-MS/MS analysis was accurate enough to determine even low concentrations of benzodiazepines, at the level of few pg/mg of hair. Levels of diazepam detected in hair of newborns were higher than levels determined in mothers. This may confirm the fact, that fetus's ability to metabolize diazepam is scarce. Nordazepam was found in higher concentrations in hair of newborns than in hair of mothers, which may suggest that it is cumulated in child's organism.

Therefore, in the current study, we examined the effects of CCK-8 (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 \u03bcg/kg) on suppression of food intake of HF-fed obese prone (OP) and resistant (OR) rats. Additionally, we determined the role of endogenous CCK in lipid-induced satiation by measuring plasma CCK levels following a lipid gavage, and tested the effect of pretreatment with devazepide, a CCK-1R antagonist on intragastric lipid-induced satiation. Finally, we examined CCK-1R mRNA levels in the nodose ganglia. We show that OP rats have reduced feeding responses to the low doses of exogenous CCK-8 compared to OR rats. Furthermore, OP rats exhibit deficits in endogenous CCK signaling, as pretreatment with devazepide failed to abolish the reduction in food intake following lipid gavage. These effects were associated with reduced plasma CCK after intragastric lipid in OP but not OR rats. Furthermore, HF feeding resulted in downregulation of CCK-1Rs in the nodose ganglia of OP rats. Collectively, these results demonstrate that HF feeding leads to impairments in lipid-induced CCK satiation signaling in obese-prone rats, potentially contributing to hyperphagia and weight gain.",

For the analysis of explanatory variables, a stepwise logistic regression was used, taking into account patient age, gender, body mass index, diagnosis and duration of schizophrenia, number of prior hospitalizations, psychotic symptoms (PANSS), disease severity (CGI-S), and patient functioning (PSP) at baseline. Early response (defined as response within 2weeks of treatment initiation) was also used as a predictor. Clinical response (defined as \u226530% decrease in PANSS total score and \u22651 point decrease in CGI-S from baseline to endpoint) was predicted by early clinical response (p<0.001) and there was a trend for the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia vs. other types of schizophrenia to predict clinical response (p=0.0525). High response (defined as \u226550% decrease in PANSS total score and \u22652 points decrease in CGI-S from baseline to endpoint) was predicted by early high response, higher baseline CGI-S, or female gender. More severely ill patients with a higher baseline CGI-S were twice likely to be treated concomitantly with a benzodiazepine.", 
    "111": "In patients with gastrectomy, it is possible that drug effectiveness is reduced compared to healthy subjects due to the increased of the drug-metabolizing enzyme, Cytochrome P450 (CYP). The purpose of this study is to verify this possibility. Gastrectomy model mice were prepared to evaluate the expression level of various CYPs in the liver from 2 to 24 weeks post-operation. No significant differences were observed in the protein expression levels of CYP3A, CYP1A, CYP2C, and CYP2D between the sham operation group and the gastrectomy group up to 4 weeks after the gastrectomy. On the other hand, significant increases in the protein expression levels of any CYPs were observed in the gastrectomy group compared to the sham operation group from 12 weeks after the gastrectomy onward. These increases in expression levels were maintained until 24 weeks after the gastrectomy. The examination of metabolic activity in the liver in the gastrectomy group using triazolam revealed that the metabolic activity at 12 weeks after the gastrectomy was significantly increased in the gastrectomy group. The administration of the anticancer drug imatinib, which is a substrate of CYP3A, to mice at 12weeks after gastrectomy resulted in an increase in the metabolic rate, suggesting a possible decrease in drug effectiveness. It has been revealed that drug effectiveness may be reduced after gastrectomy because the expression levels of various CYPs in the liver were increased over a prolonged period. The results of this study can serve as valuable fundamental knowledge for drug therapy in patients with gastrectomy.",

Drugs are extracted from 10mg of washed hair in 18h by a mixture of methanol:acetonitrile:ammonium formate (pH 5.3). Absolute recovery ranged from 70% to 106% for 75% of the analytes. The limits of detection in the low pg/mg range, may allow the detection of single dose drug exposure, with possible application in drug facilitated assaults (DFA); however, chronic use (compliance) can also be examined. The method has been fully validated for the drugs included in the study. The accuracy of the method was demonstrated by the analysis of certified authentic hair samples containing common drugs of abuse. The hair-method has broad potential as the measuring range is wide for the target analytes and new drugs can easily be added to the method due to the versatility of the extraction procedure and chromatographic system.",

    "123": "The IAPs are key regulators of the apoptotic pathways and are commonly overexpressed in many cancer cells. IAPs contain one to three BIR domains that are crucial for their inhibitory function. The pro-survival properties of XIAP come from binding of the BIR domains to the pro-apoptotic caspases. The BIR3 domain of XIAP binds and inhibits caspase 9, while the BIR2 domain binds and inhibits the terminal caspases 3 and 7. While XIAP BIR3 inhibitors have previously been reported, they also inhibit cIAP1/2 and promote the release of TNF\u03b1, potentially limiting their therapeutic utility. This paper will focus on the optimization of selective XIAP BIR2 inhibitors leading to the discovery of highly potent benzodiazepinone 36 (IC50 = 45 nM), which has high levels of selectivity over XIAP BIR3 and cIAP1 BIR2/3 and shows efficacy in a xenograft pharmacodynamic model monitoring caspase activity while not promoting the release of TNF\u03b1 in vitro.", 
    "124": "Polymeric micelles were studied as delivery carriers of diazepam, a practically insoluble drug in water, for rectal administration. The diazepam-loaded polymeric micelles were developed by using poloxamer 407 (P407), poloxamer 188, and D-\u03b1-tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol) 1000 succinate (TPGS). Among the used polymers, TPGS resulted in polymeric micelles with good characteristics for encapsulation of diazepam which had the small particle size of 8-12 nm and narrow size distribution (PI 0.053-0.275). Additionally, 7.5% w/v of TPGS could entirely entrap the desired concentration of diazepam (5 mg/mL). To improve the physical stability upon lyophilization, an addition of P407 of 1% w/v prevented aggregation, increased physical stability, and maintained chemical stability of the lyophilized powders of diazepam-loaded polymeric micelles for 3 months storage at 4\u00b0C. The rate and amount of diazepam release from TPGS polymeric micelles mainly depended on the concentration of TPGS. The release data were fitted to Higuchi's model suggesting that the drug release mechanism was controlled by Fickian diffusion. In conclusion, 10% w/v TPGS and 1% w/v P407 were the optimum formulation of lyophilized diazepam-loaded polymeric micelles.", 
    "125": "Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) are associated with cerebellar ataxia, which is refractory to treatment with GABAergic drugs. To investigate the GABAergic neuronal system in vivo, we performed a combined positron emission tomography (PET) study with [(11)C]-flumazenil and [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in three patients with cerebellar ataxia with GAD-Abs. The GABA-A receptor function was investigated using flumazenil, which is a selective GABA-A receptor ligand, while FDG-PET using a three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection analysis was performed to estimate the metabolic rates of glucose (MRGlc) in the patients. GABAergic drugs showed no efficacy for the cerebellar ataxia in all three patients, and all three displayed a significant decrease in flumazenil binding in the cerebellum. No MRGlc decrease in the cerebellum was found in the two patients who presented with amelioration of cerebellar ataxia following intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, whereas a significant MRGlc decrease in the cerebellar hemisphere was observed in another patient who showed severe cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance images and no response to the IVIG therapy. The decreased flumazenil binding in the present patients indicated cerebellar GABA-A receptor impairment, which may be due to either neuronal cell loss, as demonstrated by the decreased MRGlc, or a dysfunction in GABAergic neuronal inhibition. Although GAD-Abs have been postulated to prevent the synthesis of GABA, resulting in decreased GABAergic transmission, the GABA-A receptor impairment may play another pathogenic role in cerebellar ataxia associated with GAD-Abs resulting in a condition refractory to GABAergic drug therapy.",

After premedication with methadone and acepromazine, general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and S-ketamine. Immediately after anaesthetic induction, seizures occurred in both dogs. In the first dog the syndrome was characterized by tonic and clonic motor activity, muscular hypertone, hypersalivation, urination, defecation and hyperthermia. In the second dog muscular twitches of the temporal and masseter regions were observed, followed by increased skeletal muscles tone, hypersalivation, spontaneous urination and increase in body temperature. Recoveries from anaesthesia were uneventful and no seizures were observed. Considering the temporal association between anaesthetic induction and occurrence of seizures, and the fact that other causative factors could not be identified, it is hypothesized that S-ketamine played a role in determining the convulsive phenomena observed in these patients.

These adverse events are a considerable clinical problem and the mechanisms underlying them are multifactorial and poorly understood. Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota has a key role in energy regulation and disease states such as obesity. Moreover, we recently showed that chronic olanzapine altered the composition of the gut microbiome in the rat. It is thus possible that treatments that alter gut microbiota composition could ameliorate olanzapine-induced weight gain and associated metabolic syndrome. To this end, we investigated the impact of antibiotic-induced alteration of the gut microbiota on the metabolic effects associated with chronic olanzapine treatment in female rats. Animals received vehicle or olanzapine (2 mg kg(-1) per day) for 21 days, intraperitoneal injection, two times daily. Animals were also coadministered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail consisting of neomycin (250 mg kg(-1) per day), metronidazole (50 mg kg(-1) per day) and polymyxin B (9 mg kg(-1) per day) by oral gavage, daily, beginning 5 days before olanzapine treatment. The antibiotic cocktail drastically altered the microbiota of olanzapine-treated rats, and olanzapine alone was also associated with an altered microbiota. Coadministration of the antibiotic cocktail in olanzapine-treated rats attenuated: body weight gain, uterine fat deposition, macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue, plasma free fatty acid levels, all of which were increased by olanzapine alone. These results suggest that the gut microbiome has a role in the cycle of metabolic dysfunction associated with olanzapine, and could represent a novel therapeutic target for preventing antipsychotic-induced metabolic disease.",

The most prevalent nonprescribed medications abused by both the groups were benzodiazepines, followed by oxycodone and hydrocodone. The overall prevalence of illicit and nonprescribed drug use was significantly higher in subjects who used buprenorphine without a prescription versus prescribed use. Of the concurrent use of marijuana and cocaine with buprenorphine, cocaine is most concerning since it decreases exposure to buprenorphine (lower area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration). The concurrent use of nonprescribed benzodiazepines with buprenorphine can cause excess sedation leading to respiratory depression and even death. These findings highlight the importance of educating patients about these potential toxicities. Furthermore, pain providers should consider expanding the spectrum of drugs that they monitor in patients under treatment.", 
    "159": "The present study addressed the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on AMPA receptor (AMPAR) binding in brain regions associated with learning and memory, and investigated whether treatment with drugs acting on AMPAR could prevent passive avoidance deficits in sleep deprived animals. [(3)H]AMPA binding and GluR1 in situ hybridization signals were quantified in different brain regions of male Wistar rats either immediately after 96 h of sleep deprivation or after 24h of sleep recovery following 96 h of sleep deprivation. Another group of animals were sleep deprived and then treated with either the AMPAR potentiator, aniracetam (25, 50 and 100mg/kg, acute administration) or the AMPAR antagonist GYKI-52466 (5 and 10mg/kg, acute and chronic administration) before passive avoidance training. Task performance was evaluated 2h and 24h after training. A significant reduction in [(3)H]AMPA binding was found in the hippocampal formation of SD animals, while no alterations were observed in GluR1 mRNA levels. The highest dose of aniracetam (100mg/kg) reverted SD-induced impairment of passive avoidance performance in both retention tests, whereas GYKI-52466 treatment had no effect. Pharmacological enhancement of AMPAR function may revert hippocampal-dependent learning impairments produced after SD. We argue that such effects might be associated with reduced AMPAR binding in the hippocampus of sleep deprived animals.",

However, unlike 6-methoxyflavone, 6-methoxyflavanone was relatively inactive at \u03b11\u03b22 GABAA receptors. 6-Methoxyflavanone inhibited [(3)H]-flunitrazepam binding to rat brain membranes. Both flavonoids were found to be inactive as modulators at \u03c11, \u03c11I307S and \u03c11W328\u00a0M GABA receptors but acted as positive allosteric modulators of GABA at the benzodiazepine sensitive \u03c11I307S/W328\u00a0M GABA receptors. This double mutant retains \u03c11 properties of being insensitive to bicuculline and antagonised by TPMPA and THIP. Additionally, 6-methoxyflavanone was also a partial agonist at \u03c11W328\u00a0M GABA receptors. The relative inactivity of 6-methoxyflavanone at \u03b11\u03b22 GABAA receptors and it's partial agonist action at \u03c11W328\u00a0M GABA receptors suggest that it exhibits a unique profile not matched by other flavonoids.",

However, high discontinuation rates and dose escalation during long-term treatment have been indicated. The aim of the present study was to determine discontinuation rates, dose escalation, and patterns of co-medication with benzodiazepines. The Norwegian Prescription Database provides complete national data at an individual level on dispensed drugs. A complete national cohort of new users of strong opioids was followed up for 5 years after initiation of therapy with strong opioids. Of the 17,248 persons who were new users of strong opioids in 2005, 7229 were dispensed a second prescription within 70 days and were assumed to be intended long-term users. A total of 1233 persons in the study cohort were still on opioid therapy 5 years later. This equals 24% of the study cohort who were still alive. Of the participants, 21% decreased their annual opioid dose by 25% or more, whereas 21% kept a stable dose (\u00b1 24%) and 34% more than doubled their opioid dose from the first to the fifth year. High annual doses of opioids were associated with high annual doses of benzodiazepines at the end of follow-up. It is an issue of major concern that large dose escalation is common during long-term treatment, and that that high doses of opioids are associated with high doses of benzodiazepines. These findings make it necessary to question whether the appropriate patient population receives long-term opioid treatment.",

However, their physiological role in detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) remains to be elucidated. Here, we explored the molecular expression and function of Kv7 channel subtypes in guinea pig DSM by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, and isometric tension recordings. In whole DSM tissue, mRNAs for all Kv7 channel subtypes were detected in a rank order: Kv7.1~Kv7.2Kv7.3~Kv7.5Kv7.4. In contrast, freshly-isolated DSM cells showed mRNA expression of: Kv7.1~Kv7.2Kv7.5Kv7.3~Kv7.4. Immunohistochemical confocal microscopy analyses of DSM, conducted by using co-labeling of Kv7 channel subtype-specific antibodies and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, detected protein expression for all Kv7 channel subtypes, except for the Kv7.4, in DSM cells. L-364373 (R-L3), a Kv7.1 channel activator, and retigabine, a Kv7.2-7.5 channel activator, inhibited spontaneous phasic contractions and the 10-Hz electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions of DSM isolated strips. Linopiridine and XE991, two pan-Kv7 (effective at Kv7.1-Kv7.5 subtypes) channel inhibitors, had opposite effects increasing DSM spontaneous phasic and 10 Hz EFS-induced contractions. EFS-induced DSM contractions generated by a wide range of stimulation frequencies were decreased by L-364373 (10 \u00b5M) or retigabine (10 \u00b5M), and increased by XE991 (10 \u00b5M). Retigabine (10 \u00b5M) induced hyperpolarization and inhibited spontaneous action potentials in freshly-isolated DSM cells. In summary, Kv7 channel subtypes are expressed at mRNA and protein levels in guinea pig DSM cells. Their pharmacological modulation can control DSM contractility and excitability; therefore, Kv7 channel subtypes provide potential novel therapeutic targets for urinary bladder dysfunction.", 
    "184": "The formation and accumulation of toxic amyloid-\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2) in the brain may drive the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders could result from treatments regulating A\u03b2 homeostasis. Examples are the inhibition of production, misfolding, and accumulation of A\u03b2 or the enhancement of its clearance. Here we show that oral treatment with ACI-91 (Pirenzepine) dose-dependently reduced brain A\u03b2 burden in A\u03b2PPPS1, hA\u03b2PPSL, and A\u03b2PP/PS1 transgenic mice. A possible mechanism of action of ACI-91 may occur through selective inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on endothelial cells of brain microvessels and enhanced A\u03b2 peptide clearance across the blood-brain barrier. One month treatment with ACI-91 increased the clearance of intrathecally-injected A\u03b2 in plaque-bearing mice. ACI-91 also accelerated the clearance of brain-injected A\u03b2 in blood and peripheral tissues by favoring its urinal excretion. A single oral dose of ACI-91 reduced the half-life of interstitial A\u03b2 peptide in pre-plaque mhA\u03b2PP/PS1d mice. By extending our studies to an in vitro model, we showed that muscarinic AChR inhibition by ACI-91 and Darifenacin augmented the capacity of differentiated endothelial monolayers for active transport of A\u03b2 peptide. Finally, ACI-91 was found to consistently affect, in vitro and in vivo, the expression of endothelial cell genes involved in A\u03b2 transport across the Blood Brain Brain (BBB). Thus increased A\u03b2 clearance through the BBB may contribute to reduced A\u03b2 burden and associated phenotypes. Inhibition of muscarinic AChR restricted to the periphery may present a therapeutic advantage as it avoids adverse central cholinergic effects.",

Quantitative chemical differences between the EOs obtained from leaves and inflorescences were verified, and a new chemotype rich in globulol was described. Although there were no significant differences in the time of induction for sedation and anesthesia between the EOs, only the leaf EO at 344 mg/L anesthetized all fish without side effects. Fractionation of the leaf EO was carried out by column chromatography. The isolated compounds [(+)-1-terpinen-4-ol and (-)-globulol] showed different activity from that detected for the leaf EO in proportional concentrations and similar sedation to a eugenol control at 10 mg/L. However, fish exposed to 1-terpinen-4-ol (3 and 10 mg/L) did not remain sedated for 30 min. Anesthesia was obtained with 83-190 mg/L globulol, but animals showed loss of mucus during induction and mortality at these concentrations. Synergism of the depressor effects was detected with the association of globulol and benzodiazepine (BDZ), compared with either drug alone. Fish exposed to BDZ or globulol+BDZ association showed faster recovery from anesthesia in water containing flumazenil, but the same did not occur with globulol. In conclusion, the use of globulol in aquaculture procedures should be considered only at sedative concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/L, and its mechanism of action seems not to involve the GABAA-BDZ system.",

N-ethyl-N-(2-pyridinylmethyl)- 2-(3,4-ichlorophenyl)- 7-methylimidazo [1,2-a] pyridine-3-acetamide hydrochloride (YL-IPA08), a novel TSPO ligand that has been synthesized at our institute, exerted a high affinity for TSPO in a crude mitochondrial fraction prepared from rat cerebellum but exhibited only a negligible affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor. As expected, YL-IPA08 incubation with the cultured rat astrocyte cells increased the pregnenolone and progesterone concentration from the cultured medium. Moreover, YL-IPA08 produced significant antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in a series of mouse and rat behavior models. In addition, the antidepressant-like behavior of YL-IPA08 was totally blocked by the TSPO antagonist PK11195 in a tail suspension test, and the anxiolytic effect was blocked by PK11195 but not by a CBR antagonist in the elevated plus-maze test. Furthermore, compared with the CBR agonist diazepam, YL-IPA08 had no myorelaxant effects and did not affect the motor coordination, memory or hexobarbitone-induced sleep in mice. Overall, these results indicate that YL-IPA08 is a more potent and selective TSPO ligand, which exerts antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects on behaviors that are mediated by TSPO but does not cause the side effects that are typically associated with conventional benzodiazepines.",

The aim of this investigation was to assess the suitability of testing oral fluid as a biomarker for the presence of 4 benzodiazepines in blood and its possible application in clinical settings and in research on drug use.", 
    "209": "Paired samples of oral fluid and blood from 4080 individuals in 4 European countries were collected and analyzed for benzodiazepines using gas or liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopic detection.", 
    "210": "Concentration data for the 4 most commonly detected benzodiazepines were studied: alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, and nordiazepam. Large variations in oral fluid to blood concentration ratios were observed for the studied benzodiazepines. The interquartile ranges for the oral fluid to blood concentrations ratios corresponded to 88%-197% of the median values. Selecting cutoff concentrations in oral fluid that gave the best accuracy in identifying individuals with benzodiazepine concentrations in blood above chosen thresholds produced accuracies of 74%-85% and the fraction of false negatives was 9%-23%.", 
    "211": "The concentration of the 4 studied benzodiazepines in oral fluid can neither be used to accurately estimate the concentrations in blood nor to correctly identify patients with blood drug concentrations below or above recommended therapeutic levels. When using analytical methods with limits of quantitation corresponding to concentrations less than 0.5 ng/mL in undiluted oral fluid, it may be used to confirm a recent intake of benzodiazepines. However, it is likely that some false negatives may occur.", 
    "212": "A method for qualitative detection of 57 drugs and metabolites in umbilical cord tissue using liquid chromatography time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is described.", 
    "213": "Results from 32 deidentified positive specimens analyzed by an outside laboratory using \"screen with reflex to confirmation\" testing were compared with TOF results. In addition, 57 umbilical cord tissue specimens paired with corresponding chart review data and 37 with meconium test results were analyzed by TOF. Urine drug test results from mother (n = 18) and neonate (n = 30) were included if available. Cutoff concentrations, recovery, and matrix effects were determined by analyzing fortified drug-free cord tissue and negative specimens. Cutoffs (in nanograms per gram) ranged from 1 to 10 for opioids and opioid antagonists, 5-10 for benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, 20-40 for barbiturates, 8 for stimulants, and 4 for phencyclidine. Adequate sensitivity for the detection of cannabis exposure could not be realized with this method.", 
    "214": "Liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry can provide accurate and sensitive detection of in utero drug exposure using umbilical cord tissue.", 
    "215": "Placebo-controlled trials showed that both benzodiazepines (BDZ) and antidepressant drugs (AD) are effective in treating anxiety disorders. However, in the last years a progressive shift in the prescribing pattern from BDZ to newer AD has taken place. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze whether controlled comparisons support such a shift.", 
    "216": "CINHAL, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed and Web of Science were searched from inception up to December 2012. A total of 22 studies met the criteria for inclusion. They were mostly concerned with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA; 18/22) and involved different anxiety disorders. In order to reduce clinical heterogeneity, only the 10 investigations that dealt with the comparison between TCA and BDZ in panic disorder were submitted to meta-analysis, whereas the remaining papers were individually summarized and critically examined.", 
    "217": "According to the systematic review, no consistent evidence emerged supporting the advantage of using TCA over BDZ in treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), complex phobias and mixed anxiety-depressive disorders. Indeed, BDZ showed fewer treatment withdrawals and adverse events than AD. In panic disorder with and without agoraphobia our meta-analysis found BDZ treatments more effective in reducing the number of panic attacks than TCA (risk ratio, RR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.01-1.27). Furthermore, BDZ medications were significantly better tolerated than TCA drugs, causing less discontinuation (RR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.20-0.57) and side effects (RR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.34-0.50). As to newer AD, BDZ trials resulted in comparable or greater improvements and fewer adverse events in patients suffering from GAD or panic disorder.", 
    "218": "The change in the prescribing pattern favoring newer AD over BDZ in the treatment of anxiety disorders has occurred without supporting evidence. Indeed, the role and usefulness of BDZ need to be reappraised."
