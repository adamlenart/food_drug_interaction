The pathophysiologic implications of pain, agitation, anxiety and delirium in the ventilated patient are also discussed. Although guidelines for sedation, analgesia and neuromuscular blocking drugs in critical care have recently been published, there is great variability in clinical practice. The complexity of the environment and associated pathologies makes it difficult to implement universally applicable therapeutic regimens. Knowledge of pharmacologic mechanisms is an important tool in the development of dynamic protocols adapted to each unit. Strategies that include monitoring resources are essential for the optimization of sedation, analgesia and neuromuscular blockade.", 
    "1": "Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has been recognized as an important enzyme that modulates many aspects of neuronal function. Accumulating evidence implicates abnormal activity of GSK3 in mood disorders and schizophrenia, and GSK3 is a potential protein kinase target for psychotropics used in these disorders. We previously reported that serotonin, a major neurotransmitter involved in mood disorders, regulates GSK3 by acutely increasing its N-terminal serine phosphorylation. The present study was undertaken to further determine if atypical antipsychotics, which have therapeutic effects in both mood disorders and schizophrenia, can regulate phospho-Ser-GSK3 and inhibit its activity. The results showed that acute treatment of mice with risperidone rapidly increased the level of brain phospho-Ser-GSK3 in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum in a dose-dependent manner. Regulation of phospho-Ser-GSK3 was a shared effect among several atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. In addition, combination treatment of mice with risperidone and a monoamine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant imipramine or fluoxetine elicited larger increases in brain phospho-Ser-GSK3 than each agent alone. Taken together, these results provide new information suggesting that atypical antipsychotics, in addition to mood stabilizers and antidepressants, can inhibit the activity of GSK3. These findings may support the pharmacological mechanisms of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of mood disorders.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepines are relatively well-tolerated medicines but can induce serious problems of addiction and that is why their use is regulated. However, in developing countries like Senegal, these products are used without clear indications on their prescription, their dispensation or their use. This work focuses on the prescription of these medicines with a view to make recommendations for their rational use. Benzodiazepine prescription was studied with psychiatrists or neurologists and generalists in 2003. Specialist doctors work in two Dakar university hospitals and generalists in the 11 health centres in Dakar. We did a survey by direct interview with 29 of 35 specialists and 23 of 25 generalists. All doctors were interviewed in their office. The questionnaire focused on benzodiazepine indications, their pharmacological properties, benzodiazepines prescribed in first intention against a given disease and the level of training in benzodiazepines by doctors. Comparisons between specialists and generalists were made by chi-square test. Benzodiazepines were essentially used for anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. With these diseases, the most benzodiazepines prescribed are prazepam against anxiety and insomnia and diazepam against epilepsy. About 10% of doctors do not know that there is a limitation for the period of benzodiazepine use. The principal reasons of drugs choice are knowledge of the drugs, habit and low side effects of drugs. All generalists (100%) said that their training on benzodiazepines is poor vs. 62.1% of specialists, and doctors suggest seminars, journals adhesions and conferences to complete their training in this field. There are not many differences between specialists and generalists except the fact that specialists prefer prazepam in first intention in the insomnia treatment where generalists choose bromazepam. In addition, our survey showed that specialists' training in benzodiazepines is better than that of generalists. Overall, benzodiazepine prescription poses problems particularly in training, and national authorities must take urgent measures for rational use of these drugs.", 
    "3": "Peripheral nerve blocks can provide a valid alternative for anesthetizing patients with allergy to drugs such as atropine that are often used for general anesthesia. We report the case of a 7-year-old boy (physical status ASA II, weight 28 Kg). Relevant medical history included generalized skin rash and breathing difficulties due to bronchospasm after administration of atropine eyedrops. The boy had never undergone skin testing for allergy. With a diagnosis of distal metaphyseal fracture of the right radius, he was proposed for urgent closed reduction and osteosynthesis of the lesion. After premedication with midazolam, an axillary brachial plexus block with 0.4 mL x Kg(-1) of 1% mepivacaine was performed with the aid of a nerve stimulator. The intervention was uneventful and the patient was free of pain during and after the procedure. Axillary brachial plexus block anesthesia in this pediatric patient was easy to perform, safe, and effective. It provided satisfactory conditions for surgery and made it possible to avoid administering drugs with vagotonic effects that are often used for general anesthesia and require the use of atropine.",

Midazolam clearance and hepatic technetium labeled sestamibi (99mTc-MIBI) clearance were used to investigate CYP3A and ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) phenotype respectively and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP3A and ABCB1 were documented. A limited blood sampling strategy was employed and vinorelbine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Posterior Bayesian estimates of vinorelbine clearance were obtained for each patient using population pharmacokinetic modeling. Myelotoxicity was estimated from the fractional survival of neutrophils post-treatment.",

In a multivariable analysis, pretreatment estimated creatinine clearance (P < .01) and hepatic (99m)Tc-MIBI clearance (P = .01) were independent predictors of vinorelbine clearance. Fractional survival of neutrophils ranged from 1.3% to 100% and was significantly correlated with vinorelbine clearance (P < .01). Body-surface area was the only pretreatment predictor of fractional survival of neutrophils independent of vinorelbine clearance (P = .02).",

The prolongation of mIPSC duration does not result from an interaction with GABA transporters because it persisted in the presence of GAT-1 inhibitors (SKF-89976A and NO-711). An interaction with benzodiazepine or neurosteroid binding sites also was excluded because STP-mediated increase of decay time was still observed when these sites were initially saturated (by clobazam, zolpidem, or pregnanolone) or blocked (by flumazenil or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), respectively. In contrast, saturating barbiturate sites with pentobarbital clearly occluded this effect of STP, suggesting that STP and barbiturates interact at the same locus. This was directly confirmed by using outside-out patches, because STP increased the duration and not the frequency of opening of GABAA channels.",

PCT was provided by therapists with little or no previous exposure to cognitive-behavioral therapies. Analyses of the full intent-to-treat sample revealed no significant differences between the treatments across the follow-up period. However, when treatment completer status was added as a moderator, those receiving PCT showed lower levels of panic severity and phobic avoidance and a greater likelihood of achieving and maintaining clinically significant change. Benzodiazepine use during follow-up was associated with greater panic severity for those clients who received PCT, but no such relationship was found for TAU clients. Results are discussed in relation to the dissemination and effectiveness of PCT as well as evidence-based psychotherapies more generally.",

Outpatients received olanzapine (5-15 mg/day, N=31) or placebo (N=29) during a 1-year double-blind treatment period and no treatment during a 1-year follow-up period. Efficacy measures included the conversion-to-psychosis rate and Scale of Prodromal Symptoms scores.", 
    "46": "During the treatment year, 16.1% of olanzapine patients and 37.9% of placebo patients experienced a conversion to psychosis, a nearly significant difference. The hazard of conversion among placebo patients was about 2.5 times that among olanzapine-treated patients, which also approached significance. In the follow-up year, the conversion rate did not differ significantly between groups. During treatment, the mean score for prodromal positive symptoms improved more in the olanzapine group than in the placebo group, and the mixed-model repeated-measures least-squares mean score showed significantly greater improvement between weeks 8 and 28 with olanzapine. The olanzapine patients gained significantly more weight (mean=8.79 kg, SD=9.05, versus mean=0.30 kg, SD=4.24).", 
    "47": "A significant treatment difference in the conversion-to-psychosis rate was not demonstrated. However, these results may be influenced by low power. The nearly significant differences suggest that olanzapine might reduce the conversion rate and delay onset of psychosis. Olanzapine was efficacious for positive prodromal symptoms but induced weight gain. Further treatment research in this phase of illness is warranted.",

This study is the first to ascertain the magnitude of the crack/cocaine problem in a rural county of the UK and to determine users' needs for treatment services. A questionnaire on drug dependence and risk behaviour was completed by 306 users of drug treatment services, and focus groups were conducted with 45 self-selected crack/cocaine users. It is estimated that 31% (95% C.I., 26% to 37%) of drug users in treatment services have moderate/severe dependence on crack/cocaine. Factors associated with severe crack/cocaine dependence are severe dependence on benzodiazepines, increasing number of drugs used, engaging in sex work and non-white ethnicity. Those with severe dependence have a higher prevalence of hepatitis B and C compared with those with moderate or no dependence. All focus group participants describe a frenzied drug life so when entering treatment they require additional support to give structure to their lives to prevent relapse. Current service provision appears not to provide help to crack/cocaine users. Given the lack of pharmacological treatment, programmes should incorporate a wide range of activities and interventions to provide structure to clients' lives. Learning from ex-users was perceived as an important component of treatment.", 
    "49": "One hundred eighty-eight seizure episodes in 46 children were randomly assigned to receive treatment with rectal diazepam and intranasal midazolam with doses of 0.3 mg/kg body weight and 0.2 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Efficacy of the drugs was assessed by drug administration time and seizure cessation time. Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were measured before and after 5, 10, and 30 minutes following administration of the drugs in both groups. Mean time from arrival of doctor to drug administration was 68.3 +/- 55.12 seconds in the diazepam group and 50.6 +/- 14.1 seconds in the midazolam group (P = 0.002). Mean time from drug administration to cessation of seizure was significantly less in the midazolam group than the diazepam group (P = 0.005). Mean heart rate and blood pressure did not vary significantly between the two drug groups. However, mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturation differed significantly between the two drug groups at 5, 10, and 30 minutes after drug administration. Intranasal midazolam is preferable to rectal diazepam in the treatment of acute seizures in children. Its administration is easy, it has rapid onset of action, has no significant effect on respiration and oxygen saturation, and is socially acceptable.", 
    "50": "Sleep apnea may be associated to psychological symptoms and to increase use of antidepressant drugs. It is unknown if the use of benzodiazepines, psychoactive drugs with a depressant effect on the brain, is similar, in this regard, to antidepressant drugs use. Thirty patients with treated arterial hypertension and excessive weight (body mass index >25), either regularly using (13 patients) or not using (17 patients) benzodiazepines, were studied, by comparing the apnea/hypopnea index measured in a sleep study in both groups. Cardiac left chamber dimensions, corrected QT interval, body weight, height and mass index, as well as cervical and abdominal circumferences, were additional parameters under study. The mean apnea/hypopnea index was found to be significantly greater in patients not under chronic benzodiazepine use, when compared to the other group of patients (21.8+/-12.4, n=17 versus 9.7+/-11.3, n=13, p<0.05). Mean cervical and abdominal diameters were also greater in patients not treated with benzodiazepines. We conclude that, in this small group of patients with treated arterial hypertension and excessive weight, chronic benzodiazepine therapy was not associated with a greater mean apnea/hypopnea index. Further studies are needed to establish if, in fact, an inverse association might exist.",

They comprise a wide array of etiologies, which may originate before, during, or after liver transplantation. The objective of this study was to describe the nature of the main neurological complications in patients with end-stage liver failure. Several toxins including ammonia, manganese, benzodiazepine-like substances, gamma-aminobutyric acid-like substances, and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission are at the top of the list of candidates for hepatic encephalopathy, subclinical encephalopathy, and extrapyramidal signs before liver transplantation. Central pontine myelinolysis, cerebrovascular autoregulation impairment, and paradoxical cerebral embolism are probably responsible for the neurological complications during liver transplantation. Neurological complications represented by alterations of mental status, seizures, and focal motor deficits have been described after liver transplantation. These complications have been attributed to several pathogenetic factors, such as a poorly functioning graft, an intracranial hemorrhage, a cerebral infarction, an infection, or the toxicity of immunosuppressants.",

After testing the behavioral action of the benzodiazepines on the open field and the elevated plus-maze, the effects of the three drugs on neuronal metabolism of particular limbic regions were measured using cytochrome c oxidase (CO) histochemistry. Diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) and alprazolam (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced clear anxiolytic effects and a decrease in locomotion, whereas zolpidem (2 mg/kg i.p.) caused an intense hypnotic effect. The anxiolytic effects of alprazolam were distinguishable from diazepam due to the pharmacological and clinical profile of this triazolobenzodiazepine. CO activity decreased significantly in almost all the limbic regions evaluated after zolpidem administration. However, significant prominent decreases in CO activity were found after diazepam treatment in the medial mammillary nucleus, anteroventral thalamus, cingulate cortex, dentate gyrus and basolateral amygdala. Alprazolam caused similar decreases in CO activity, with the exception of the prelimbic and cingulate cortices, where significant increases were detected. In agreement with previous studies using other functional mapping techniques, our results indicate that particular benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics induce selective changes in brain oxidative metabolism.",

The compounds were extracted from 100 microl of whole blood by simultaneous multitube, microscale liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and derivatized by N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA), without the need for the time-consuming concentration stage. In the analytical separation, various parameters of fast GC/NICI-MS were applied, e.g. the use of hydrogen as a GC carrier gas, a high carrier gas velocity, a small film thickness of the analytical column, fast MS data acquisition, fast temperature ramping, and high initial and final temperatures of GC column. Sensitive identification, screening and quantitation of 18 compounds of interest were achieved in chromatographic separation in only 4.40 min. Accurate and reproducible results were obtained by using five different and carefully selected deuterated analogues on the basis of the chemical properties of the target analytes. Nevertheless, for alpha-OH-midazolam, and for bromazepam and flunitrazepam at low concentrations, the results can be considered only semiquantitative on the basis of the validation data. The extraction efficiencies ranged from 74.3 to 105.7% and the limits of quantitation (LOQ) from 1 to 100 ng ml(-1). Rapid sample preparation and fast chromatographic separation allowed cost-efficient, reliable and high sample-throughput analyses with a low amount of manual work. The method was fully validated and accredited according to EN ISO/IEC 17025 standards and is applicable for sensitive, reliable and quantitative determination of benzodiazepines, zaleplon and zopiclone, e.g. in clinical and forensic toxicology.",

    "63": "Despite the efficacy of currently available antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are common among individuals treated for major depressive disorder and are associated with an increased risk of relapse and poor psychosocial functioning. However, distinguishing treatment-emergent side effects from residual symptoms can be challenging for clinicians. Anxiety, sleep disturbance, somnolence/fatigue, apathy and cognitive dysfunction are among the more frequent residual symptoms. Approaches to the management of residual symptoms include addressing treatment-emergent side effects and co-morbid conditions, optimizing antidepressant dosing and using augmentation therapy. Clinicians are often guided in their decisions by anecdotal impressions. Studies assessing the evaluation and treatment of residual symptoms and side effects will contribute importantly to the optimal acute and long-term management of depression.", 
    "64": "The distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain has been widely studied with SPECT using (123)I-iomazenil and semiquantitative approaches, but these methods do not allow quantification of the total receptor site concentration available for binding (B'(max)) and of the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)/V(R)). One of the major obstacles to full quantitative studies is that pharmacologic effects preclude the administration to humans of the high doses of iomazenil required to displace the labeled ligand from the receptors. In this study, we applied a dual-ligand protocol using the unlabeled ligand flumazenil, which lacks pharmacologic effects, to quantify all binding parameters of the benzodiazepine receptor-(123)I-iomazenil interactions.",

The experimental protocol consisted of injections of (123)I-iomazenil and/or unlabeled flumazenil. We developed a kinetic model to integrate the different pharmacokinetics of these 2 ligands. To simplify the model, we assumed linear relationships between iomazenil and flumazenil parameters and adjusted them using a coupled fitting procedure. The resulting constrained 5-parameter model was then used to quantify the biologic parameters.",

    "68": "It has been known for many years that benzodiazepine compounds effectively antagonize seizures induced by organophosphorous nerve agents. In the event of poisoning, a combination of three drugs is commonly used: an anticholinergic drug (e.g. atropine), an oxime used as cholinesterase reactivator (e.g. pralidoxime or HI-6) and an anticonvulsant (i.e. benzodiazepine). Most of anticholinergics and oximes are freely soluble in water, whereas many benzodiazepines are not. However, a water-soluble prodrug form of diazepam, avizafone, has been adopted by French armed forces for the immediate treatment of nerve agent seizure. The degradation behaviour of this new drug was investigated under different stress degradation conditions (hydrolytic, oxidative, photolytic and thermal) as recommended by International Conference on Harmonization. Successful separation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient from decomposition products formed under stress conditions was achieved using liquid chromatography. The method was validated with respect to specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy.",

Whether D(1)- and/or GBR-mediated increases in progestin-facilitated lordosis involve the cAMP-synthesizing enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, in the VTA, was investigated. In Experiment 1, ovariectomized estradiol (E(2); 10 microg at h 0)+progesterone (P; 250 microg at h 45)-primed hamsters first received bilateral infusions of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA; 12 microM/side), or vehicle, and then were infused with the D(1) agonist, SKF38393 (100 ng/side), the GBR agonist, muscimol (100 ng/side), or vehicle, to the VTA. Lordosis was evaluated before and 30 min after each infusion. In Experiment 2, ovariectomized, E(2)-primed (10 microg at h 0) rats received VTA infusions of DDA (12 microM/side) or vehicle; SKF38393 (100 ng/side), muscimol (100 ng/side), or vehicle; and the neurosteroid, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP; 100 or 200 ng/side), or beta-cyclodextrin vehicle. Lordosis was assessed before the series of infusions, immediately after drug infusions and 10 or 60 min after 3alpha,5alpha-THP infusions. Progestin- or progestin plus SKF38393-or muscimol-mediated increases in lordosis were blocked by DDA pretreatment. Thus, in the VTA, progestins' membrane action may involve adenylyl cyclase.",

    "77": "Essential tremor (ET) affects approximately 4% of the population above 65 years of age. The traditional view that ET is a familial monosymptomatic disorder with a benign prognosis has recently been challenged, as it is now known to be a progressive and clinically heterogeneous condition with sporadic and familial forms. The pathogenesis of ET is not fully understood, though a disordered central mechanism is the most likely site of origin with possible modulation by muscle adrenoreceptors. The limited post-mortem studies have not shown consistent abnormalities in the brains of ET patients. ET is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, particularly in the older population. Tremor amplitude increases with age, accounting for substantial disability in older people. Current therapy (drugs and neurosurgery) has significant limitations in older people. A better understanding of its pathophysiology in the future will help in developing more effective therapy, including neuroprotective strategies.", 
    "78": "Cryopreserved human hepatocytes have been used to predict hepatic in-vivo clearance. Physiologically-based direct scaling methods generally underestimate human in-vivo hepatic clearance. Cryopreserved human hepatocytes were incubated in 100% serum and in serum-free medium to predict the in-vivo hepatic clearance of six compounds (phenazone (antipyrine), bosentan, mibefradil, midazolam, naloxone and oxazepam). Monte Carlo simulations were performed in an attempt to incorporate the variability and uncertainty in the measured parameters to the prediction of hepatic clearance. The intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) and the associated variability of the six compounds decreased in the presence of serum and the values were reproducible across donors. The predicted CL(hep, in-vivo) obtained with hepatocytes from donors incubated in serum was more accurate than the prediction obtained in the absence of serum. For example, the CL(hep, in-vivo) of mibefradil in donor GNG was 4.27 mL min(-1) kg(-1) in the presence of serum and 0.46 mL min(-1) kg(-1) in the absence of serum (4.88 mL min(-1) kg(-1) observed in-vivo). Using the results obtained in this study together with an extended data set (26 compounds), the clearance of 77% of the compounds was predicted within a 2-fold error in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, 85% of the compounds were successfully predicted within a 2-fold error. In conclusion, cryopreserved human hepatocyte suspensions represented a convenient and predictive model to assess human drug clearance.", 
    "79": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is widely expressed in peripheral tissues, blood cells, and in glia cells in the brain. We have previously developed two positron emission tomography (PET) ligands, N-(2-[(11)C],5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([(11)C]2) and its [(18)F]fluoroethyl analogue ([(18)F]6), for the current investigation of PBR in the human brain. The aim of this study was to label the potent PBR agonist N-(4-chloro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(isopropoxybenzyl)acetamide (3) and its ethyl (7) and methyl (8) homologues with (11)C and to evaluate them as PET ligands for PBR with mice, rats, and monkeys. Ligands [(11)C]3, [(11)C]7, and [(11)C]8 were synthesized by alkylation of phenol precursor 9 with 2-[2-(11)C]iodopropane ([(11)C]10), [1-(11)C]iodoethane ([(11)C]11), and [(11)C]iodomethane ([(11)C]12), respectively. The alkylating agent [(11)C]10 or [(11)C]11 was prepared by reacting CH(3)MgBr with [(11)C]CO(2), followed by reduction with LiAlH(4) and iodination with HI. In vitro quantitative autoradiography determined that 3, 7, and 8 had potent binding affinities (K(i) = 0.07-0.19 nM) for PBR in the rat brain. These [(11)C]ligands could pass across the blood-brain barrier and enter the rat brain (0.17-0.32% of injected dose per gram wet tissue). Ex vivo autoradiography showed that the [(11)C]ligands preferably distributed in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, two regions with richer PBR density in the rat brain. The co-injection of PBR-selective 2 reduced the [(11)C]ligand binding in the two regions, suggesting that binding in the rat brain was specific to PBR. PET study determined that the [(11)C]ligands preferably accumulate in the occipital cortex of the monkey brain, a region with a high density of PBR in the primate brain. Moreover, in vivo binding of the methyl homologue [(11)C]8 in the monkey brain could be inhibited by PBR-selective 2 or 1, indicating that some of the [(11)C]8 binding was due to PBR. Metabolite analysis demonstrated that these [(11)C]ligands were metabolized by debenzylation to polar products mainly in the plasma.", 
    "80": "Pediatric oncology/hematology patients, especially those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), often undergo repeated painful invasive procedures. Deep sedation, mandatory for these procedures in young children, can reduce patient anxiety and get their compliance during procedures. This study assessed clinical experience of employing methohexital or thiamylal with midazolam as sedative for elective invasive procedures in children with ALL. Between November 1997 and March 2004, 20 out of 33 ALL children received deep sedation after evaluation, mainly because of relatively young age (mean age 4.60 +/- 2.03 years). A total of 176 procedures were done, with 139 being intrathecal therapy. There were 98 and 78 procedures for the methohexital and thiamylal groups, respectively. The average dosages to complete the procedures were 2.2 +/- 1.2 mg/kg for methohexital and 3.4 +/- 2.1 mg/kg for thiamylal. One out of the 176 procedures was failed due to bradycardia, hypotension and cyanosis, in the methohexital group. Otherwise, no significant adverse events were found. Increased heart rate (HR) during stable blood pressure (BP) was observed in both groups. In conclusion, under careful monitoring and performed by experienced practitioners, the application of methohexital or thiamylal combined with midazolam to achieve deep sedation for invasive procedures in young children with ALL is safe.",

To investigate factors contributing to this variability, rates of midazolam (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 protein content were determined using a set of 54 human liver microsomes (HLMs). Genetic factors investigated included CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes, CYP3A4 mRNA alternative splicing, and CYP3A4 transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites. Demographic and environmental factors investigated included age, gender, and histories of smoking and alcohol consumption. MDZ 1'-hydroxylation rates varied from 0.025 to 3.106 nmol/min/mg protein, with significant correlation to CYP3A4 protein content (r(s) = 0.92, P < 0.001) but less robust correlation to CYP3A5 protein content (r(s) = 0.60, P < 0.001). We identified eight CYP3A4 SNPs (five novel) and nine CYP3A5 SNPs (one novel), as well as seven CYP3A4 and two CYP3A5 haplotypes (all novel). No influence of genotype or haplotype on MDZ 1'-hydroxylation rate was observed, although CYP3A5*3A (g.6986a>g; g.31611c>t) carriers had lower CYP3A5 protein content compared with noncarriers (P = 0.004). No alternative splicing of CYP3A4 mRNA was found. Likewise, only a single transcriptional start site and polyadenylation site for CYP3A4 mRNA were identified. Subjects with a history of alcohol consumption had 2.2-fold higher median MDZ 1'-hydroxylation (P = 0.017), whereas no influence of age, gender, or smoking was evident.

The SCN contain multiple autonomous single-cell circadian oscillators that are coupled among themselves, generating a single rhythm. However, under determined circumstances, the oscillators may uncouple and generate several rhythmic patterns. Rats exposed to an artificially established 22-h light-dark cycle (T22) express two stable circadian rhythms in their motor activity that reflect the separate activities of two groups of oscillators in the morphologically well-defined ventrolateral and dorsomedial SCN subdivisions. In the experiments described in this paper, we studied the effect of melatonin and diazepam (DZP) administration in drinking water on the dissociated components of rat motor activity exposed to T22, to deduce the possible mechanism of these drugs on the circadian system. In order to suppress the endogenous circadian rhythm of melatonin, in some of the rats the pineal gland or the superior cervical ganglia were removed. The results show that melatonin or DZP treatment increased the manifestation of the light-dependent component to the detriment of the manifestation of the non-light-dependent component and that melatonin, but not DZP, shortens the period of the non-light-dependent component. These findings suggest that both DZP and melatonin favor entrainment to external light, and that melatonin could also act on the SCN, producing changes in the period of the circadian cycle.",

Cardiac muscle cells showed the strongest respiratory inhibition by Serenace and were least inhibited by Hirnamin. The highest sensitivity to Cercine was noted for neurons, while gastric mucosa cells had almost no sensitivity. Sensitivity to Serenace, which was expected to have a strong nerve action, was higher in myocardial cells instead. In the present study, we suggested the possibility of studying individual differences in drug sensitivity through investigation of toxicity in each organ as opposed to toxicity in the individual. In addition, Serenace, which was developed as a neurotopic agent, showed a higher toxicity in cardiac muscle cells than in neurons.

Steroids and neurosteroids can also rapidly modulate membrane excitability and synaptic transmission by interacting with ion channels, that is, ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors or voltage-dependent Ca2+ or K+ channels. More recently, the cloning of a plasma membrane-located G protein-coupled receptor for progestins in various species has suggested that steroids/neurosteroids could also influence second-messenger pathways by directly interacting with specific membrane receptors. Here we review the experimental evidence implicating steroids/neurosteroids in the modulation of synaptic transmission and the evidence for a role of endogenously produced neurosteroids in such modulatory effects. We present some of our recent results concerning inhibitory synaptic transmission in lamina II of the spinal cord and show that endogenous 5alpha-reduced neurosteroids are produced locally in lamina II and modulate synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid A(GABAA) receptor function during development, as well as during inflammatory pain. The production of 5alpha-reduced neurosteroids is controlled by the endogenous activation of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which initiates the first step of neurosteroidogenesis by stimulating the translocation of cholesterol across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Tonic neurosteroidogenesis observed in immature animals was decreased during postnatal development, resulting in an acceleration of GABAA receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) kinetics observed in the adult. Stimulation of the PBR resulted in a prolongation of GABAergic mIPSCs at all ages and was observed during inflammatory pain. Neurosteroidogenesis might play an important role in the control of nociception at least at the spinal cord level.",

However, substantial and lasting changes may occur and result in symptomatic hepatitis. In the following case report, we report on a 44-year-old female patient diagnosed as Bipolar Disorder Type I, whose liver enzyme levels increased ten fold of normal ranges during the third year of the olanzapine treatment and returned to the normal levels within three weeks after olanzapine discontinuation. Although significant liver enzyme elevations are uncommon during olanzapine treatment, based on reports of serious hepatotoxicity, controlled and longitudinal research are needed to learn side effects of this drug on liver. Clinicians should be aware of possible hepatotoxic effects of atypical antipsychotics and should monitor the liver enzyme levels whenever they feel necessary.",

    "169": "We have used intracellular recording to investigate the existence of a functional link between muscarinic presynaptic acetylcholine (ACh) autoreceptors, the intracellular serine-threonine kinases-mediated transduction pathways and transmitter release in the motor nerve terminals of adult rats. We found the following. (1) Transmitter release was reduced by the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) blocker pirenzepine and enhanced by the M2 blocker methoctramine. The unselective mAChR blocker atropine increased ACh release, which suggests the unmasking of another parallel release-potentiating mechanism. There are therefore two opposite, though finely balanced, M1-M2 mAChR-operated mechanisms that tonically modulate transmitter release. (2) Both M1 and M2 mechanisms were altered when protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA) or the P/Q-type calcium channel were blocked. (3) Both PKC and PKA potentiated release when they were specifically stimulated [with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Sp-8-Br cAMPs, respectively], and both needed the P/Q channel. (4) In normal conditions PKC seemed not to be directly involved in transmitter release (the PKC blocker calphostin C did not reduce release), whereas PKA was coupled to potentiate release (the PKA blocker H-89 reduced release). However, when an imbalance of the M1-M2 mAChRs function was experimentally produced with selective blockers, an inversion of the kinase function occurred and PKC could then stimulate transmitter release, whereas PKA was uncoupled. (5) The muscarinic function may be explained by the existence of an M1-mediated increased PKC activity-dependent potentiation of release and an M2-mediated PKA decreased activity-dependent release reduction. These findings show that there is a precise interrelation pattern of the mAChRs, PKC and PKA in the control of the neurotransmitter release.",

    "171": "Drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP3A isoenzymes have wide interindividual variability and normally distributed plasma clearance distributions. This makes precise dosing difficult to achieve clinically, which may compromise safe therapy. We hypothesized that with potent inhibition of CYP3A, we could clinically render patients \"poor metabolizer\" phenotype status, and thus reduce interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of midazolam, a well-known CYP3A substrate. Intravenous bolus midazolam at doses of 2.5 mg and 1 mg were administered to 28 and 29 patients with cancer with and without co-administration of 200 mg of oral ketoconazole twice per day respectively for 3 days, starting 1 day before midazolam. Pharmacokinetic analyses of midazolam on both groups were derived using noncompartmental methods and compared. The mean clearance (CL) of midazolam was reduced 6 times by ketoconazole. Midazolam CL were normally distributed in both groups, and ranged from 1.7 to 51.9 and 1.4 to 8.2 L/hour in the control and ketoconazole groups, respectively, corresponding to a 7-fold reduction in dispersion between the 2 groups. Area-under-the-curve variability was reduced by >100%. A limited sampling model consisting of time points at 15 and 300 minutes was validated as a phenotype for CYP3A activity to facilitate the use of midazolam as a probe drug for CYP3A activity. Potent inhibition of CYP3A by ketoconazole reduced midazolam CL and area-under-the-curve variability, allowing for more precise achievement of therapeutic target drug exposure. Prospective evaluation of this approach, together with dose adjustment based on limited sampling, seems warranted.",

They are used both in the community and in the hospital; however, one of their major side effects is respiratory depression.

Irrespective of pressure to extubate such children, physicians must be alert to the potential risk of flumazenil in the clinical scenario.", 
    "173": "Benzodiazepines act mainly at postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. In rat neocortical layer V pyramidal neurons, we found that midazolam (MDZ), a benzodiazepine, increases the frequency of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) via insertion of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at presynaptic GABAergic boutons. Although nicotine alone had no effect, MDZ plus nicotine dramatically increased mIPSC frequency. Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, mimicked the actions of nicotine. MDZ increased the number of alpha-bungarotoxin-bound boutons that were blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, as revealed by confocal imaging of a neuron-synaptic bouton preparation. Thus, MDZ may induce membrane translocation of alpha7 nAChRs on GABAergic boutons via activation of PKC, enabling endogenous acetylcholine to increase GABA release. The above actions seem unique to MDZ because neither other benzodiazepines (diazepam and flunitrazepam) nor zolpidem had this effect. The findings reveal both a novel cholinergic modulatory mechanism affecting GABAergic transmission and a novel action of some general anesthetics.",

Although we found that the basal plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone in isolated rats was slightly decreased compared with that in group-housed animals no other significant changes were found in the steroidogenic machinery (peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, steroidogenic regulatory protein (StAR)). However, the functional response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis HPA axis to an acute stressful stimulus (foot shock), or to an acute injection of ethanol or isoniazid is markedly increased in isolated rats. Behavioral studies have also indicated that the ability of ethanol to inhibit isoniazid-induced convulsions is greater in isolated rats than in group-housed animals and this effect of isolation is prevented by treatment with the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride. Social isolation modified the effects of ethanol on the amounts of StAR mRNA and protein in the brain suggesting an alteration in the mechanism of cholesterol transport in mitochondria. Moreover, the amounts of the alpha4 and delta subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in the hippocampus were increased in isolated rats, and these effects were accompanied by an increase in GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic inhibitory currents in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Ethanol also increased the amplitude of GABA(A) receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons with a greater potency in hippocampal slices prepared from socially isolated rats than in those from group-housed, an effect inhibited by finasteride.",

We analysed 49 months of the statutory health insurance Gm\u00fcnder Ersatzkasse (GEK) and enrolled all first hip fractures. The index date was the day of hospital admission. Exposure to new use of benzodiazepines was compared within the five periods preceding the index date. Out of 1630 subjects, 223 (13.7%) had at least one prescription of benzodiazepines in the preceding 150 days before the index date, 74 (4.5%) of them as a first prescription.

In conclusion, the start of a new benzodiazepine is associated with an increased risk of hip fractures.

This was initially examined by conducting self-competition zonal elution experiments in which m-HPPH or p-HPPH were placed in both the mobile phase and injected sample. It was found that each metabolite had a single major binding site on HSA. Competitive zonal elution experiments using l-tryptophan, warfarin, digitoxin, and cis-clomiphene as site-selective probes indicated that m-HPPH and p-HPPH were interacting with the indole-benzodiazepine site of HSA. The estimated association equilibrium constants for m-HPPH and p-HPPH at this site were 3.2 (+/-1.2)x10(3) and 5.7 (+/-0.7)x10(3)M(-1), respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. Use of these metabolites as competing agents for injections of phenytoin demonstrated that m-HPPH and p-HPPH had direct competition with this drug at the indole-benzodiazepine site. However, the use of phenytoin as a competing agent indicated that this drug had additional negative allosteric interactions on the binding of these metabolites to HSA. These results agreed with previous studies on the binding of phenytoin to HSA and its effects on the interactions of HSA with site-selective probes for the indole-benzodiazepine site.",

Target activity may then be defined through cell-based studies, often years after the initial identification of activity. Some pipeline compounds are believed to act through conventional targets, whereas others are structurally novel and may act by novel mechanisms. Follow-on agents include the levetiracetam analogs brivaracetam and seletracetam that act as SV2A-ligands; the valproate-like agents valrocemide, valnoctamide, propylisopropyl acetamide, and isovaleramide; the felbamate analog flurofelbamate, a dicarbamate, and the unrelated carbamate RWJ-333369; the oxcarbazepine analog licarbazepine, which probably acts as a use-dependent sodium channel blockers, and its prodrug acetate BIA 2-093; various selective partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists, including ELB139, which is a positive allosteric modulator of alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors.

At the end of each treatment, freezing and feeding were measured. Only the animals exposed to inescapable footshock paradigm showed significant increase in the food intake and freezing behavior in comparison to the control animals.

Weak displacement (25%) was evident at batrachotoxin site 2 on voltage gated Na+ channels. LCM did not inhibit neurotransmitter transport mechanisms for norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-HT or GABA, nor did it inhibit GABA transaminase. LCM at 100 microM produced a significant reduction in the incidence of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC's) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC's) in cultured cortical cells and blocked spontaneous action potentials (EC50 61 microM). LCM did not alter resting membrane potential or passive membrane properties following application of voltage ramps between -70 to +20 mV. The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker phenytoin potently blocked sustained repetitive firing (SRF) but, in contrast, 100 microM LCM failed to block SRF. No effect was observed on voltage-clamped Ca2+ channels (T-, L-, N- or P-type). Delayed-rectifier or A-type potassium currents were not modulated by LCM (100 microM). LCM did not mimic the effects of diazepam as an allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptor currents, nor did it significantly modulate evoked excitatory neurotransmission mediated by NMDA or AMPA receptors (n > or = 5). Evidently LCM perturbs excitability in primary cortical cultures but does not appear to do so via a high-affinity interaction with an acknowledged recognition site on a target for existing antiepileptic drugs.",
