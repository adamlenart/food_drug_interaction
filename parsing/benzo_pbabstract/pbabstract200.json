    "5": "The records of six poison centers and one statewide poison center network were searched for all exposures to tiagabine for the years 2000-2002. Inclusion criterion was a human tiagabine exposure with follow-up to a known outcome; exclusion criterion was multiple drug ingestion.", 
    "6": "57 cases met the inclusion criterion. Thirty-seven patients were female (67%). Mean and median ages were 30.5 years (S.D. +/- 18.5) and 31 years, respectively, with a range of 2 to 80 years. Seven patients were < or = 6 years. Neurologic symptoms were common: lethargy, seizures (multiple), status epilepticus, seizure (single), coma, confusion, agitation, tremors, dizziness, dystonias/abnormal posturing, and hallucinations. Other symptoms included respiratory depression, tachycardia, hypertension, and hypotension. Therapies included benzodiazepines, mechanical ventilation, phenytoin, phenobarbital, diphenhydramine, and dopamine. The mean onset and duration of symptoms were 1.3 hours (+/- 0.5, range 1-2 hours) and 9.1 hours (+/- 3.8, range 4-24 hours), respectively. Dose ingested by history was known for 38 patients (67%). The lowest dose with the development of multiple seizures and coma was 96 mg. This occurred in a 36-year-old female with a history of epilepsy. The lowest dose with symptoms in a child was 8 mg, in a 6-year-old with drowsiness. Mean dose of those with and without symptoms was 102 mg and 10 mg, respectively. The mean dose for patients experiencing seizures was 224 mg (+/- 172, range 96 to 680 mg). The mean dose for patients experiencing coma and respiratory depression was 270 mg (+/- 204, range 96 to 680 mg). Fifty-two patients (91%) were evaluated in the ED of whom 43 were admitted for medical care.",

    "8": "We studied the effects of treating status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium and pilocarpine at postnatal day 15 (P15) or 28 (P28), on the severity of acute SE and of SE-induced epileptogenesis. Rats received topiramate (10 or 50 mg/kg, IP) or diazepam (5 mg/kg, IP) 20, 40 or 70 min after pilocarpine, and three months after SE 24-h video/EEG recordings were obtained for one (P28) or two weeks (P15) continuously. In P15 rats, topiramate did not modify the course of SE, yet treatment at 20 or 40 min completely prevented the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) while later treatment (70 min) was partially effective in reducing the severity and frequency of SRS. Diazepam was effective against acute SE at all time points tested. Early (20 min) but not late treatment with diazepam had the effect of reducing the frequency and severity of SRS. In P28 rats, both drugs reduced the cumulative seizure time. Early treatment (20 min) with either drug reduced the incidence of chronic epilepsy. Late treatment (40/70 min) did not alter the incidence of SRS, but decreased their frequency. This study demonstrates that, in the treatment of SE, anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic effects can be dissociated in a development-specific manner: topiramate was antiepileptogenic without being an effective anticonvulsant in P15 animals at the doses tested. Diazepam, on the other hand, was a better anticonvulsant than an antiepileptogenic agent in the P15 animals at the dose tested. Such effects were not seen in the older animals.", 
    "9": "Zolpidem is chemically unrelated to classical benzodiazepines but has demonstrated relatively high affinity binding to the alpha(1) GABA(A) receptor. To assess pharmacodynamic and neurochemical effects of zolpidem, open-field behavior, pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold and benzodiazepine receptor binding in vitro were evaluated in the same animal following a single dose of zolpidem. Zolpidem (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg), lorazepam (2 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally in male CD-1 mice. Behavioral activity, assessed by three open-field parameters, was decreased following the two highest doses of zolpidem (5 and 10 mg/kg), and reached significance at the 10 mg/kg dose. Locomotor activity was also decreased significantly by lorazepam as expected. Pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold was increased with the administration of 2 and 10 mg/kg zolpidem as well as with lorazepam. Apparent affinity (K(D)) of [3H]flunitrazepam, a non-selective ligand, for the benzodiazepine receptor in cortical membrane preparations was not significantly changed, while receptor number (Bmax) was decreased at all doses of zolpidem, reaching significance at the 10 mg/kg dose. These results confirm that the behavioral effects of zolpidem are similar to those of classical benzodiazepines. In addition, zolpidem had no significant effect on the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for [3H]flunitrazepam, but did decrease the density of receptor binding sites.", 
    "10": "High doses of diazepam (10.0-20.0 mg/kg) were shown to reduce the volume of acute inflammatory paw edema in rats as a response to carrageenan administration. This effect was attributed to an action of diazepam on the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) present in the adrenal and/or immune/inflammatory cells. The present study was undertaken to analyze the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) on the effects of diazepam on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats (CIPE) and to look for the presence of PBR and inducible/constitutive NO synthases (NOS) on slices taken from the inflamed paws of diazepam-treated rats. For that, an acute inhibition of NO biosynthesis was achieved using 50.0 mg/kg No mega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME), L-arginine (300.0 mg/kg), the true precursor of NO, and D-arginine (300.0 mg/kg), its false substrate, were also used. The following results were obtained: (1) diazepam (10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg) decreased CIPE values in a dose- and time-dependent way; (2) diazepam effects on CIPE were increased by L-NAME pretreatment; (3) treatment with L-arginine but not with D-arginine reverted at least in part the decrements of CIPE values observed after diazepam administration; (4) PBR were found in endothelial and inflammatory cells that migrated to the inflammatory site at the rat paw; (5) confocal microscopy showed the presence of both PBR and NOS in endothelial and inflammatory cells taken from inflamed paw tissues of rats treated with diazepam a finding not observed in tissues provided from rats treated with diazepam's control solution. These results suggest an important role for NO on the effects of diazepam on CIPE. Most probably, these effects reflect a direct action of diazepam on PBR present in the endothelium of the microvascular ambient and/or on immune/inflammatory cells. An action like that would lead, among other factors, to a decrease in NO, generated by NO synthase, and thus in the mechanisms responsible for CIPE.", 
    "11": "Sedation is commonly required by critically ill patients and inadequate sedation may be hazardous. Traditionally, subjective scales have been used for monitoring sedation. Bispectral index has been proposed, although its utility in the intensive care unit is debated. Our aim was to evaluate the depth of sedation in intubated surgical critically ill patients by means of two sedation scales (Ramsay and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation) and bispectral index.", 
    "12": "Sedation was assessed prospectively in 50 postoperative intubated patients requiring at least 24 h of sedation (35 propofol, 15 midazolam/fentanyl), every 8 h for a 24 -h period. The bispectral index value recorded was the mean value obtained during a 10-min observation period, whenever the quality signal index was above 75% and the electromyographic signal was below 25%.", 
    "13": "Most of the patients (78%) were oversedated (bispectral index < 60). The three sedation scores (global data) correlated significantly (P < 0.001). This correlation was lost in the midazolam group in which the patients were also significantly more sedated than the propofol group (P = 0.001). The correlation between the bispectral index and the scales in the midazolam group reappeared when the measurements with a Ramsay = 6 or an Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation = 1 were excluded.", 
    "14": "Sedation should be monitored routinely in intensive care units. The Ramsay and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scales showed equal efficacy. Bispectral index might prove useful for discriminating between deeper levels of sedation.", 
    "15": "Many suspected victims of surreptitious drug and/or alcohol administration may present to hospitals or healthcare centres and never come to the attention of forensic or law enforcement professionals. Therefore, it is necessary to include clinical toxicological findings in order to assess the growing perception that instances have become more widespread within society. Between July 2002 and June 2004, 180 requests were received for toxicological analysis of individuals presenting to their GP or hospital following self-reported or suspected surreptitious drug administration (e.g. \"spiked drink\"). There was a rise of 77% in the number of requests from 2002-2003 to 2003-2004 which peaked in December of each year (most likely due to the increased socialization of people during the festive season). Between 2002 and 2004, 34% of patients were male and 66% were female with an overall average age of 25 (range 11-73). Following urinary analysis using immunoassay and gas chromatography (mass spectrometry, flame-ionisation detection and nitrogen-phosphorus detection), 59% of cases were negative for drugs and alcohol in 2002-2003 and 51% in 2003-2004. Drugs or alcohol were detected in 32% of cases in 2002-2003 and in 45% in 2003-2004. Out of the 169 cases analysed, ethanol (alcohol) was the most commonly detected compound (24% of cases), followed by amphetamines (amphetamine, MDMA, MDA, MDEA--11% of cases), cannabinoids (9% of cases), benzodiazepines (temazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam--9% of cases), cocaine (4% of cases), opiates (dihydrocodeine, codeine--2% of cases), chlorpheniramine (0.6% of cases), ephedrine 0.6% of cases), fluoxetine (0.6% of cases), tramadol (0.6% of cases) and zopiclone (0.6% of cases). No gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) or flunitrazepam was detected in the cases analysed.",

Following the approval of the institutional Clinical Research Ethics Committee, 100 patients in ASA I-II scheduled for elective gynecologic surgery, were included into a double blind study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups; the placebo and the premedicated. Oral 10 mg diazepam in the evening before surgery and 1.5 mg midazolam at least 15 min before surgery. The same anesthetic procedure was applied for both groups. Anxiety levels of patients were assessed by using Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAIs). Blood samples for cortisol measurements were obtained at the preoperative visits, preanesthesia and intraoperative phases. Gastric contents were collected through an orally inserted gastric tube, acidity was measured by using Merck's pH paper. In placebo group, the preanesthetic STAIs values were increased compared to the values obtained at preoperative visit (p < 0.001). The preanesthetic STAIs values were decreased in premedicated group (p < 0.001). The changes of preanesthetic and preoperative visit values were statistically different (p < 0.001). The preanesthetic and intraoperative cortisol values were increased in both groups compared to values of preoperative visit. The augmentation was significantly higher in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Positive correlation was observed between basal state anxiety and basal cortisol values and preanesthetic STAIs and cortisol values in the placebo group (r = 0.325, p < 0.05). These data support that preoperative sedation suppresses the preoperative anxiety and the cortisol augmentation resulting from surgery and stress.",

Included trials were double-blind or single-blind crossover studies involving a total of 137 patients of which 109 had myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 28 had myotonia congenita. The studies were of poor quality. Therefore, we were not able to analyse the results of all identified studies. Two small crossover studies without a washout period demonstrated a significant effect of imipramine and taurine in myotonic dystrophy. One small crossover study with a washout period demonstrated a significant effect of clomipramine in myotonic dystrophy. Meta-analysis was not possible.", 
    "27": "Due to insufficient good quality data and lack of randomised studies, it is impossible to determine whether drug treatment is safe and effective in the treatment of myotonia. Small single studies give an indication that clomipramine and imipramine have a short-term beneficial effect and that taurine has a long-term beneficial effect on myotonia. Larger, well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment for myotonia.",

No trials of amisulpiride, sertindole or zotepine were identified which met the criteria for inclusion. The included trials led to the following results:1. There was a significant improvement in aggression with risperidone and olanzapine treatment compared to placebo.2. There was a significant improvement in psychosis amongst risperidone treated patients.3. Risperidone and olanzpaine treated patients had a significantly higher incidence of serious adverse cerebrovascular events (including stroke), extra-pyramidal side effects and other important adverse outcomes.4. There was a significant increase in drop-outs in risperidone (2 mg) and olanzapine (5-10 mg) treated patients.5. The data were insufficient to examine impact upon cognitive function.", 
    "34": "Evidence suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are useful in reducing aggression and risperidone reduces psychosis, but both are associated with serious adverse cerebrovascular events and extra-pyramidal symptoms. Despite the modest efficacy, the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is marked risk or severe distress. Although insufficient data were available from the considered trials, a meta-analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (using data not in the public domain) suggested a significant increase in mortality (OR 1.7).",

    "37": "Bath-applied midazolam (1 microm) diminished Adelta- and C-fiber evoked polysynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents in both amplitude and integrated area. However, it affected neither Adelta- and C-fiber evoked monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents in amplitude nor miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in amplitude, frequency, and decay time constant. In the presence of a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (5 microm), midazolam (1 microm) did not diminish Adelta-fiber evoked polysynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents, suggesting that midazolam modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid interneurons in the dorsal horn.", 
    "38": "Midazolam reduced excitatory synaptic transmission by acting on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A/benzodiazepine receptor in interneurons, leading to a decrease in the excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons. This may be a possible mechanism for the antinociception by midazolam in the spinal cord.", 
    "39": "Craving and relapse are core symptoms of drug addiction and alcoholism. It is suggested that, after chronic drug consumption, long-lasting neuroplastic changes within the glutamatergic system are important determinants of addictive behavior. Here, we show that the AMPA type glutamate receptor plays a crucial role in alcohol craving and relapse. We observed, in two animal models of alcohol craving and relapse, that the AMPA antagonist GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine] dose-dependently reduced cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior and the alcohol deprivation effect. The involvement of the AMPA receptor in these phenomena was further studied using mice deficient for the GluR-C AMPA subunit [GluR-C knock-out (KO)]. GluR-C KOs displayed a blunted, cue-induced reinstatement response and alcohol deprivation effect, when compared with wild-type controls; however, no differences between genotypes could be observed regarding ethanol self-administration under operant or home cage drinking conditions. These results imply a role for GluR-C in alcohol relapse, although this phenotype could also be attributable to a reduction in the total number of AMPA receptors in specific brain areas. In conclusion, AMPA receptors seem to be involved in the neuroplastic changes underlying alcohol seeking behavior and relapse. Thus, AMPA receptors represent a novel therapeutic target in preventing relapse.", 
    "40": "We have established that there is a considerable amount of common genetic influence on physiological dependence and associated withdrawal from sedative-hypnotic drugs including alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and inhalants. We previously mapped two loci responsible for 12 and 9% of the genetic variance in acute alcohol and pentobarbital withdrawal convulsion liability in mice, respectively, to an approximately 28-cM interval of proximal chromosome 11. Here, we narrow the position of these two loci to a 3-cM interval (8.8 Mb, containing 34 known and predicted genes) using haplotype analysis. These include genes encoding four subunits of the GABA(A) receptor, which is implicated as a pivotal component in sedative-hypnotic dependence and withdrawal. We report that the DBA/2J mouse strain, which exhibits severe withdrawal from sedative-hypnotic drugs, encodes a unique GABA(A) receptor gamma2 subunit variant compared with other standard inbred strains including the genetically similar DBA/1J strain. We also demonstrate that withdrawal from zolpidem, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist selective for alpha1 subunit containing GABA(A) receptors, is influenced by a chromosome 11 locus, suggesting that the same locus (gene) influences risk of alcohol, benzodiazepine and barbiturate withdrawal. Our results, together with recent knockout studies, point to the GABA(A) receptor gamma2 subunit gene (Gabrg2) as a promising candidate gene to underlie phenotypic differences in sedative-hypnotic physiological dependence and associated withdrawal episodes.",

    "42": "Temperament and attachment scores based on adaptability and approachability determinants judged by the parent and interactive and Frankl behavior rating scores determined by the operator were used to compare preoperative behavioral characteristics between the 2 groups. The Ohio State Behavioral Rating Scale (OSBRS) and the Frankl behavior rating scale were used to determine intraoperative behavioral outcomes for agent acceptance and efficacy.", 
    "43": "Analysis of 64 sedation records revealed that the 2 groups had similar preoperative behavioral characteristics. Improvements in the Frankl behavioral rating scores were observed during the sedation, but no statistically significant difference between the drops and spray groups was measured using the OSBRS. For the procedural event of drug administration, however, the spray group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction (P=.025) in aversive behaviors when compared to drops administration as measured by the OSBRS. This finding was observed, even though the volume of spray was greater than used in the drops group.", 
    "44": "Spray administration of INM produced significantly less aversive behavior than administering drops in 2- to 3-year-old dental patients of similar behavioral characteristics. The effectiveness of the conscious sedation technique was not influenced by the method of nasal administration.

An atypical neuroleptic was prescribed for 63.0% of patients and a classic neuroleptic for 49.7%, an association of neuroleptics for 22.0%. In both settings, the most prescribed neuroleptics were olanzapine (28.0%) and risperidone (18.6%) with a higher mean daily dosage in the public care setting. At least one neuroleptic treatment change (drug and/or dosage) occurred during the previous year for 44.9% and 39.2% patients, in public and private settings, respectively. In both settings, reasons for changes were mainly lack of efficacy (55.1%) and side effects (49.8%).", 
    "48": "Public and private care populations were different but not as much as expected. In both settings, atypical neuroleptics were the predominant drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia outpatients.

Despite the usefulness of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of depression and their positive influence on cognitive functioning possibly related to their impact on cortisol, little is known about their effect on HPA axis function.", 
    "51": "Therefore, this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study investigated the influence of the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine and olanzapine in comparison with haloperidol and placebo on plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin levels. Eleven healthy male volunteers were studied during four sessions one week apart, orally receiving placebo, quetiapine (50 mg), olanzapine (5 mg), or haloperidol (3 mg). Blood samples were taken at hourly intervals from 0900 until 1700 hours. For ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin a significant effect of treatment condition (p < or = 0.005; p < or = 0.035; p < or = 0.0001, respectively) for area under the curve (AUC) was found. In comparison to placebo, quetiapine and olanzapine significantly reduced ACTH (p < or = 0.002; p < or = 0.05, respectively) and cortisol (p < or = 0.005; p < or = 0.03, respectively). No effect of haloperidol on AUC of ACTH or cortisol levels was observed. In comparison with placebo, haloperidol (p < or = 0.0001) and olanzapine (p < or = 0.0001) elevated AUC of prolactin plasma levels, whereas no significant effect was observed for quetiapine as a main effect of treatment condition. The atypical antipsychotics' strong influence on HPA-function with pronounced ACTH and cortisol lowering is possibly related to the atypicals' blockade of serotonergic receptors, but blockade of adrenergic or histaminergic receptors may play a role as well. The observed HPA-axis down-regulation may be clinically important for the atypicals' effects on depressive symptomatology and cognitive functioning.",

Limited sampling is a useful strategy for optimizing sampling and reducing costs and labor. We studied limited sampling models using multiple linear regressions to predict the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of midazolam using either midazolam plasma concentrations or the ratio of 1-hydroxymidazolam (1-OH MDZ) to midazolam plasma concentrations. CYP3A baseline activity data for oral midazolam from previous studies were used (45 healthy adults for models using midazolam plasma concentrations and 41 healthy adults for models using the ratios of 1-OH MDZ to midazolam plasma concentrations). Limited sampling models were derived, validated, and evaluated for precision and bias. Two equations using the time points at 0.5 and 6 hours and 0.5, 2, and 6 hours were acceptable and predictive of midazolam AUC using midazolam plasma concentrations. No 1-OH MDZ to midazolam plasma concentration ratios accurately predicted midazolam AUC.",

R667 is metabolized by CYP3A4 and therefore may interact with CYP3A4 substrates. In the present study, 18 healthy male subjects received a single 15-mg oral dose of MDZ with and without R667 coadministration. Serial blood samples were collected predose and up to 24 hours after each MDZ dose for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation. The PK parameters for MDZ, R667, and metabolites were estimated using noncompartmental methods. MDZ exposure was very similar in the presence and absence of R667 (C(max) = 50.8 vs 46.2 ng/mL; AUC(0-last) = 215 vs 216 ng.h/mL; AUC(0-last) ratio = 0.26 vs 0.26, respectively). R667 exposure was not affected by midazolam coadministration as compared with historical data. Based on the results of this study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction should be anticipated between R667 and CYP3A4 substrates.",

This study's purpose was to assess the effects of milk thistle and black cohosh supplementation on CYP3A activity and compare them to a clinically recognized inducer, rifampin, and inhibitor, clarithromycin. Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive a standardized milk thistle (900 mg) or black cohosh (80 mg) supplement for 14 days. Subjects also received rifampin (600 mg) and clarithromycin (1000 mg) for 7 days as positive controls for CYP3A induction and inhibition, respectively. Midazolam was administered orally before and after each supplementation and control period. The effects of milk thistle, black cohosh, rifampin, and clarithromycin on midazolam pharmacokinetics were determined using noncompartmental techniques. Unlike those observed for rifampin and clarithromycin, midazolam pharmacokinetics was unaffected by milk thistle or black cohosh. Milk thistle and black cohosh appear to have no clinically relevant effect on CYP3A activity in vivo.",

This study assessed the absorption of each by different routes of administration. Secondarily, the influence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) genotype was assessed. It was hypothesized that more rapid absorption of the OLZ ODT would occur when administered sublingually versus standard oral administration. A randomized, 3-way crossover study assessed the 5-mg OLZ formulations in healthy volunteers (n = 10). Blood was collected (0-8 hours) to assess OLZ pharmacokinetics using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Both routes of ODT administration resulted in more measurable early concentrations relative to SOT. However, there were no statistically significant differences observed between any of the OLZ exposures for observed pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max), T(max), AUC(0-8h)). The homozygous TT genotype for P-gp resulted in an increased AUC of OLZ for SOT administration but not for either condition where sublingual absorption could occur.", 
    "56": "The activity and stability of the p53 tumor suppressor are regulated by the human homologue of the mouse double minute 2 (Hdm2) oncoprotein. It has been hypothesized that small molecules disrupting the Hdm2:p53 complex would allow for the activation of p53 and result in growth suppression. We have identified small-molecule inhibitors of the Hdm2:p53 interaction using our proprietary ThermoFluor microcalorimetry technology. Medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug design led to the development of an optimized series of benzodiazepinediones, including TDP521252 and TDP665759. Activities were dependent on the expression of wild-type (wt) p53 and Hdm2 as determined by lack of potency in mutant or null p53-expressing cell lines or cells engineered to no longer express Hdm2 and wt p53. TDP521252 and TDP665759 inhibited the proliferation of wt p53-expressing cell lines with average IC(50)s of 14 and 0.7 micromol/L, respectively. These results correlated with the direct cellular dissociation of Hdm2 from wt p53 observed within 15 minutes in JAR choriocarcinoma cells. Additional activities of these inhibitors in vitro include stabilization of p53 protein levels, up-regulation of p53 target genes in a DNA damage-independent manner, and induction of apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Administration of TDP665759 to mice led to an increase in p21(waf1/cip1) levels in liver samples. Finally, TDP665759 synergizes with doxorubicin both in culture and in an A375 xenograft model to decrease tumor growth. Taken together, these data support the potential utility of small-molecule inhibitors of the Hdm2:p53 interaction for the treatment of wt p53-expressing tumors.", 
    "57": "The cyclopyrrolone pagoclone binds with roughly equivalent high affinity (0.7-9.1nM) to the benzodiazepine binding site of human recombinant GABA(A) receptors containing either an alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 subunit. However, whereas it was a partial agonist at alpha1-, alpha2- and alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors, pagoclone was a full agonist at receptors containing an alpha3 subunit. In the rat elevated plus maze assay pagoclone (3mg/kg) had significant anxiolytic-like activity but at all three doses tested (0.3, 1 and 3mg/kg p.o.) it produced a significant reduction in the total distance travelled. This sedative-like effect was confirmed in rat chain-pulling and spontaneous locomotor assays. Surprisingly, in the plasma and brain samples derived from the elevated plus maze assay, the major metabolite of pagoclone, 5'-hydroxy pagoclone, was present at 10-20-fold higher concentrations relative to the parent compound. In order to establish whether this metabolite might have pharmacological activity, we measured its affinity and efficacy profile and found that both were comparable to those of pagoclone with the exception that efficacy at the alpha1 subtype was considerably greater for 5'-hydroxy pagoclone compared with the parent. This metabolite had significant anxiolytic-like activity in the elevated plus maze but at these same doses (0.3-3mg/kg p.o.) also produced sedation. It is therefore likely that in rats 5'-hydroxy pagoclone mediates the majority of the pharmacological actions following pagoclone administration.", 
    "58": "Pharmacological studies have documented that altered drug responses, particularly to benzodiazepines, are common in elderly populations. While numerous factors may contribute to changes in drug response, age-related alterations in the molecular composition of GABA(A) receptors may be a key factor in regulating these responses. We employed quantitative densitometry to examine the cytological features and density of highly prevalent hippocampal GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha1 and beta2/3) in young and aged rhesus monkeys. alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit immunostaining was differentially distributed throughout the hippocampus. In addition, beta2/3 immunolabeling in aged monkeys was characterized by marked intersubject variability in labeling intensity, with dramatic reductions present in 3 of 5 samples. alpha1 immunolabeling in aged monkeys was significantly reduced in the CA2 and CA3 subregions, and in hilus/polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that not only are GABA(A) receptor subunits differentially distributed throughout the hippocampus, but they are also differentially altered with increased age--changes that may have an important impact on the binding properties of GABA(A) receptor pharmacological agents.",

    "63": "Children undergoing anaesthesia and surgery can experience significant anxiety and distress during the peri-operative period, but whether routine premedication is necessary is currently debated. Benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drugs as premedication in paediatric anaesthesia. In the US, 50% of young children undergoing surgery receive premedication and midazolam is the most frequently used drug in this context (1). Nishina and coworkers (2) concluded in a review article in 1999 that clonidine, administered via an oral, rectal, or caudal route, is a promising adjunct to anaesthetics and analgesics to enhance quality of peri-operative management in infants and children. Later publications also support the use of clonidine for premedication (3-6). The aim of this communication is to review the use of clonidine in paediatric anaesthesia and to propose clonidine as a promising alternative to midazolam. Clonidine is associated with a number of beneficial effects in the context ofanaesthesia both in adults and children. Why clonidine is not routinely use in clinical practice despite the massive publication list is to a large extent due to the lack of marketing efforts from the pharmaceutical industry since multiplegeneric preparations are now readily available on most markets. Midazolam is also associated with a number of beneficial effects, but is far from an ideal premedicant in children, especially with regards to the amnesia, confusion and long term behavioural disturbances. Clonidine has contrary to midazolam no effect on respiration. We believe that clonidine is a good alternative to midazolam as premedication in infants and children.",

Immediate postoperative cystogram and pelvic computed tomogram (CT) after the development of seizures demonstrated a fluid collection from the suprapubic catheter site into the anterior abdominal wall. The subsequent reabsorption of free water from the fluid collection, with the contribution of postoperative hypotonic intravenous fluid administration and possible transient inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion resulted in acute dilutional hyponatremia and consequent seizures. Strategies to prevent hyponatremia in children during urological procedures, with emphasis on the importance of reserving free water as the irrigation fluid are discussed.", 
    "65": "Isoflurane is commonly used in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), both before and early after injury, yet it is rarely used clinically. Narcotics and benzodiazepines are frequently used after injury in clinical TBI. We compared seven anesthetic/sedative agents applied after injury in the controlled cortical impact model: diazepam, fentanyl, isoflurane, ketamine, morphine, pentobarbital, and propofol. Our objective was to provide insight into the relative degrees of neuroprotection provided by these agents in a standard model of TBI. We hypothesized that the choice of anesthetic/sedative early after experimental TBI critically impacts outcome and that the agents most commonly used clinically may be less neuroprotective than isoflurane. Rats treated with isoflurane had the best cognitive recovery (p < 0.05) and hippocampal neuronal survival (p < 0.05). Conversely, rats treated with ketamine had the most hippocampal neuronal death (p < 0.05). Morphine or propofol, two agents commonly used clinically, were associated with the poorest motor function on post-trauma day 1-5 (p < 0.05). Our data support beneficial effects of isoflurane early after experimental TBI. Our data suggest that the early post-TBI use of isoflurane, despite practical logistical issues, could potentially provide clinical benefits in TBI--versus other commonly used sedatives or analgesics. Furthermore, the choice of post-injury sedation and analgesia could have important implications on attempts to translate novel therapies from bench to field or bedside.", 
    "66": "Correct dosing of drugs in neonates, infants and children is hampered by a general lack of knowledge about drug disposition in this population. Suggested methods to improve our knowledge without performing conventional full-scale investigations include population pharmacokinetic studies, allometric scaling of drug disposition according to bodyweight and in silico prediction of pharmacokinetics. The last method entails scaling of pharmacokinetic parameters according to age-dependent changes in drug absorption and elimination capacity, plasma protein binding and physiological characteristics of the subjects. Maturation (or ontogeny) of the drug-metabolising part of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system is thus an important factor in the calculations for most drugs. The aim of this commentary is to test and critically examine the proposed methods to estimate hepatic clearance (CL) as a function of age (0-20 years), with CYP3A-mediated metabolism as the case in point. Midazolam and alfentanil were used as model drugs. Allometric scaling failed to predict the CL of midazolam and alfentanil in neonates. Calculations using in vitro findings on CYP maturation gave better estimates for neonates but very divergent ones for older infants and children. This was chiefly due to very different data on CYP3A4/5 ontogeny in three published studies. In the age range where full adult CYP activity per gram of liver could be assumed, allometric scaling and in silico predictions gave similar results. These predictions were also in approximate agreement with clinical data.The findings with the two model drugs can very probably be generalised to most drugs cleared by CYP-dependent hepatic metabolism. Allometric scaling accounts for development of body size and function but not for the fact that the drug-metabolising capacity of the liver is generally low at birth. The crucial question in the prediction of CL is thus when the activity of the applicable CYP isoform(s) attains adult levels. There are still not enough data on this, particularly when different studies even on the same CYP isoform have given very divergent results. It may also be pointed out that CYP ontogeny is an area where we have at least some information. There are several other important developmental changes about which we know practically nothing. Thus, while allometric scaling is generally unreliable for prediction in neonates and infants, the alternative method of in silico prediction can at present be used only to obtain tentative initial estimates of drug CL. Neither of the methods can be used as a substitute for actual clinical studies.", 
    "67": "A single-channel flow injection (FI) manifold with spectrophotometric detection has been designed and fabricated for diazepam determination. A 100 microl sample and/or standard solution containing diazepam was injected into a flowing stream of 0.1 mol L(-1) hydrochloric acid with the optimum flow rate of 6.8 mL min(-1). As soon as the sample reached the detector, the FI signal as a peak was recorded at 360 nm. The optimum conditions for microg amounts of diazepam were achieved. A linear calibration graph over the range of 2-110 mg L(-1) diazepam was obtained with the regression equation Y = 0.2926X + 0.5896 (r2 = 0.9929). The method was very sensitive, since as little as 0.60 mg L(-1) could be detected; very reproducible with an RSD of 3.3% (n=11); and very rapid with a sampling rate of 100 h(-1). The limit of quantitation (10 sigma) was 2.0 mg L(-1). The proposed FI procedure has been satisfactorily applied to the quantitation of diazepam in commercial pharmaceutical formulations. The obtained results were in excellent agreement with those obtained by the conventional spectrophotometric method, verified by the student t-test at the 95% confidence level.",

In the present study, DPA-713 has been labelled from the corresponding nor-analogue using [11C]methyl triflate (CH3OTf). Conditions for HPLC were also modified to include physiological saline (aq. 0.9% NaCl)/ethanol:60/40 as mobile phase making it suitable for injection. The total time of radiosynthesis, including HPLC purification, was 18-20 min. This reported synthesis of [11C]DPA-713, using [11C]CH3OTf, resulted in an improved radiochemical yield (30-38%) compared to [11C]methyl iodide (CH3I) (9) with a simpler purification method. This ultimately enhances the potential of [11C]DPA-713 for further pharmacological and clinical evaluation. These improvements make this radioligand more suitable for automated synthesis which is of benefit where multi-dose preparations and repeated syntheses of radioligand are required.",

This report discusses 3 patients with medical conditions, including vascular access problems and morbid obesity, which made nerve blocks at the elbow advantageous compared with other anesthetic techniques. Peripheral nerve blocks at the elbow were done before surgery in a block room, so the patients spent less time in the operating room. Nerve blocks at the elbow are effective anesthesia for hand procedures with no patient requiring further local anesthetic injection and opioids for pain or expressing any discomfort during surgery. The blocks are easy to perform and set up quickly, and using long-acting local anesthetics, elbow blocks provide postoperative pain control for approximately 10 hours. The nerve blocks at the elbow facilitate the perioperative process by being done out of the operating room and providing prolonged pain control without the need for opioids, so nausea may be avoided.", 
    "70": "To investigate the putative mediation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in the cytotoxicity of flavonoids, in this study, modulatory effects of several flavonoids on the lipid peroxide (LPO) production and PBR mRNA expression of human neuroblastoma cells were observed. Elevated levels of peroxidated products in cancer cells may activate pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative signaling pathways. Treatment of 10(-6) M 4'-chlorodiazepam and PK 11195 ligands of the PBR for 6 days enhanced the generation of LPO of the human neuroblastoma cells. Several flavonoids, well-known cytotoxic substances, potentiated the enhancement of LPO production by PBR ligands. Treatment of 10(-6) M flavonoids for 6 days elevated the expression of PBR mRNA in cells. These findings indicate that the potential of flavonoids to induce apoptosis in cancer cells is strongly associated with their PBR-inducing properties, thereby providing a new mechanism by which polyphenolic compounds may exert their cancer-preventive and anti-neoplastic effects.", 
    "71": "The molecular distribution in fully amorphous solid dispersions consisting of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-diazepam and inulin-diazepam was studied. One glass transition temperature (T(g)), as determined by temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC), was observed in PVP-diazepam solid dispersions prepared by fusion for all drug loads tested (10-80 wt.%). The T(g) of these solid dispersions gradually changed with composition and decreased from 177 degrees C for pure PVP to 46 degrees C for diazepam. These observations indicate that diazepam was dispersed in PVP on a molecular level. However, in PVP-diazepam solid dispersions prepared by freeze drying, two T(g)'s were observed for drug loads above 35 wt.% indicating phase separation. One T(g) indicated the presence of amorphous diazepam clusters, the other T(g) was attributed to a PVP-rich phase in which diazepam was dispersed on a molecular level. With both the value of the latter T(g) and the DeltaC(p) of the diazepam glass transition the concentrations of molecular dispersed diazepam could be calculated (27-35 wt.%). Both methods gave similar results. Water vapour sorption (DVS) experiments revealed that the PVP-matrix was hydrophobised by the incorporated diazepam. TMDSC and DVS results were used to estimate the size of diazepam clusters in freeze dried PVP-diazepam solid dispersions, which appeared to be in the nano-meter range. The inulin-diazepam solid dispersions prepared by spray freeze drying showed one T(g) for drug loads up to 35 wt.% indicating homogeneous distribution on a molecular level. However, this T(g) was independent of the drug load, which is unexpected because diazepam has a lower T(g) than inulin (46 and 155 degrees C, respectively). For higher drug loads, a T(g) of diazepam as well as a T(g) of the inulin-rich phase was observed, indicating the formation of amorphous diazepam clusters. From the DeltaC(p) of the diazepam glass transition the amount of molecularly dispersed diazepam was calculated (12-27 wt.%). In contrast to the PVP-diazepam solid dispersions, DVS-experiments revealed that inulin was not hydrophobised by diazepam. Consequently, the size of diazepam clusters could not be estimated. It was concluded that TMDSC enables characterization and quantification of the molecular distribution in amorphous solid dispersions. When the hygroscopicity of the carrier is reduced by the drug, DVS in combination with TMDSC can be used to estimate the size of amorphous drug clusters.", 
    "72": "We previously investigated leptin levels in antipsychotic-induced weight gain and found that atypical antipsychotic, especially clozapine and olanzapine-induced weight gain is related to increased levels of leptin. It has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of leptin-induced lipolysis. To explore the pathophysiology of weight gain during atypical antipsychotic treatment, we planned to investigate olanzapine's influence on leptin and NO levels and weight gain. The study comprised 21 patients with schizophrenia who were enrolled in olanzapine monotherapy, and 21 healthy controls. The fasting plasma NO and leptin levels were measured in both patients and controls at baseline. The patients were also evaluated at sixth week according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), body mass index (BMI), weight, serum leptin and NO levels. At baseline, the mean leptin level in the olanzapine group was not different compared to that in controls after BMI or age adjustment. A significant increase in leptin levels by means of olanzapine use was seen (P<0.01). Higher plasma NO levels were observed in patients with schizophrenia compared with the control group at baseline (P<0.01). At the evaluation of week 6, a significant decrease in the mean plasma NO level was found in the olanzapine group (P<0.05). The changes in total PANSS scores were correlated with change in leptin levels (r=0.58, P<0.05), and with the change in weight (r=0.54, P<0.05). In addition, there was a severe significant negative correlation between the changes in leptin levels and NO levels (r=0.73, P<0.01). The results confirmed that leptin and NO might be associated with olanzapine-induced weight gain.",

The incidence of this disorder is not clearly established, but over 122 cases have so far been reported in the literature. The pathogenesis is not entirely known, although it has been hypothesized that particular susceptibility of the Purkinje cells of cerebellum to anoxic injury may play a key role. A case is presented of an independently living 60-year-old woman admitted to the rehabilitation unit with diffuse myoclonus after sustaining a cardio-pulmonary arrest. She presented with severe jerking movements in all extremities with startle to noise and exacerbations upon attempting any purposeful actions. The patient's myoclonus was controlled by a variety of anti-epileptic medications. The patient initially responded to a combination of divalproex sodium and zonisamide, but relapsed in several weeks, requiring addition of levetriacetam and clonazepam. At a 1-year follow-up she demonstrated a significant improvement in ambulation and self-care activities. This case illustrates that, although patients with post-anoxic myoclonus cannot be fully cured, their quality of life can be significantly improved by rehabilitation interventions.", 
    "120": "Kainate receptors (KARs) are widely expressed the basal ganglia. In this study, we used electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and whole-cell recording techniques to examine the localization and function of KARs in the rat globus pallidus (GP). Dendrites were the most common immunoreactive elements, while terminals forming symmetric or asymmetric synapses and unmyelinated axons comprised most of the presynaptic labeling. To determine whether synaptically released glutamate activates KARs, we recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the GP following single-pulse stimulation of the internal capsule. 4-(8-Methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5 h]{2,3}benzodiazepine-5-yl)-benzenamine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466, 100 microm), an alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, reduced but did not completely block evoked EPSCs. The remaining EPSC component was mediated through activation of KARs because it was abolished by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX), an AMPA/KAR antagonist. The rise time (10-90%) and decay time constant (tau) for those EPSCs were longer than those of AMPA-mediated EPSCs recorded before GYKI 52466 application. KAR activation inhibited EPSCs. This inhibition was associated with a significant increase in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a presynaptic action of KAR. KAR inhibition of EPSCs was blocked by the G-protein inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C. Our results demonstrate that KAR activation has dual effects on glutamatergic transmission in the rat GP: (1) it mediates small-amplitude EPSCs; and (2) it reduces glutamatergic synaptic transmission through a presynaptic G-protein coupled, PKC-dependent, metabotropic mechanism. These findings provide evidence for the multifarious functions of KARs in regulating synaptic transmission, and open up the possibility for the development of pharmacotherapies to reduce the hyperactive subthalamofugal projection in Parkinson's disease.", 
    "121": "Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system but has also important functions in the epidermis. It is involved in keratinocyte barrier function and in re-epithelialization processes after wounding. Recently, glutamate signalling has been suggested to be implicated in the development of melanoma. The present study examined the expression and functionality of metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors on normal human melanocytes. We found that cultured melanocytes expressed the ionotropic glutamate receptors GluR2 and 4 [alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxsazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors] and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors 2A and 2C and possibly the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1. Melanocytes were also found to express specific glutamate transporters and decarboxylases, but appeared neither to produce nor to release l-glutamate. Stimulation with 10 or 100 microM AMPA or NMDA elevated intracellular calcium concentrations in melanocytes, and thus demonstrated the functionality of the glutamate receptors. Millimolar concentrations of l-glutamate did not induce melanocyte toxicity and had no stimulating effect on melanin production. However, blockage of AMPA and NMDA receptors with CFM-2, memantine or MK801 caused a rapid and reversible change in melanocyte morphology, which was associated with disorganisation of actin and tubulin microfilaments. After 24 h of treatment with the AMPA receptor inhibitor CFM-2, there was a sharp reduction in the expression of the crucial melanocyte differentiation and proliferation factor MiTF. The results of this study demonstrate a role for glutamate in melanocyte regulation that may have implications in melanocyte associated disorders.",

Cross-reacting characteristics of these two assays toward a list of 25 benzodiazepines were evaluated. These assays were then applied to the analysis of urine specimens collected from patients treated with flunitrazepam (FM2) and/or other benzodiazepines. Resulting data were evaluated against gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) test data to ascertain corresponding cutoffs suitable for the two-step immunoassay/GC-MS testing strategy. Both Cozart and Immunalysis ELISAs are highly specific to 7-amino-FM2, with the latter reagent generating slightly higher responses. Diazepam and FM2 (parent compound) are the only compounds with significant cross-reacting characteristics. With the ELISA reagents' optimal dynamic ranges set between 0 and 25 ng/mL, urine specimens should be diluted by a factor of 5 prior to ELISA testing. If 30 ng/mL 7-amino-FM2 is adapted as the GC-MS cutoff, the corresponding ELISA cutoffs range is approximately 100-200 (or 20-40 when diluted by a factor of 5) ng/mL.

Data were acquired using positive electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring using one precursor ion/product ion transition per compound. Quantification was performed using 13 deuterated analogues. Further confirmation of the identity of the compounds was achieved through a second injection of positive samples, monitoring two transitions per compound. The limits of quantification for all benzodiazepines ranged from 1 to 2 ng/mL in blood, 10 to 25 ng/mL in urine, and 0.5 to 10 pg/mg in hair.

The CME were prepared by the titration method and were characterized for globule size and size distribution, zeta potential, and drug content. CME was radiolabeled with (99m)Tc (technetium) and biodistribution of drug in the brain was studied in Swiss albino rats after intranasal and intravenous administrations. Brain scintigraphy imaging in rabbits was also performed to ascertain the uptake of the drug into the brain. Pre and postCME formulation treated human nasal mucosa was subjected to transmission electron microscopy to investigate the mechanism of drug uptake across the nasal mucosa. CME were transparent and stable with mean globule size of 15 +/- 10 nm and zeta potential of -30 mV to -40 mV. (99m)Tc-labeled clonazepam solution ((99m)Tc CS)/ clonazepam microemulsion (CME)/clonazepam mucoadhesive microemulsion (CMME) were found to be stable and suitable for in vivo studies. Brain/blood uptake ratios at 0.50 hour (h) following intranasal CMME, CME, clonazepam solution (CS), and intravenous CME administrations were found to be 0.67, 0.50, 0.48, and 0.13, respectively indicating more effective targeting with intranasal administration and best targeting of the brain with intranasal CMME. Brain/blood ratio at all sampling points up to 8 h following intranasal administration of CMME compared to intravenous was found to be twofold higher indicating larger extent of distribution of the drug in brain. Rabbit brain scintigraphy also showed higher intranasal uptake of the drug into the brain. Transmission electron microscopy revealed significant accretion of CMME within interstitial spaces and paracellular mode of transport due to stretching of the tight junctions present in the nasal mucosa. This investigation demonstrates a more rapid and larger extent of transport of clonazepam into the rat brain with intranasal CMME, which may prove useful in treating acute status epileptics.",

    "139": "Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused psychostimulant. Multiple high doses of METH cause long-term toxicity to dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) nerve terminals in the brain, as evidenced by decreases in DA and 5-HT content, decreases in tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activities, decreases in DA and 5-HT re-uptake sites, and nerve terminal degeneration. Multiple high doses of METH are known to elicit a rapid increase in DA release and hyperthermia. Although METH also produces a delayed and sustained rise in glutamate, no studies have shown whether METH produces structural evidence of excitotoxicity in striatum, or identified the receptors that mediate this toxicity directly, independent of alterations in METH-induced hyperthermia. These experiments investigated whether METH can cause excitotoxicity as evidenced by cytoskeletal protein breakdown in a glutamate receptor-dependent manner. METH increased calpain-mediated spectrin proteolysis in the rat striatum 5 and 7 days after METH administration without affecting caspase 3-dependent spectrin breakdown. This effect was completely blocked with the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, GYKI 52466, but not the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. However, AMPA or NMDA receptor antagonism did not attenuate the METH-induced depletions of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Independent mechanisms involved in mediating spectrin proteolysis and DAT protein loss are discussed.",

    "141": "Schizophrenia is one of the most expensive psychiatric conditions because of high direct and indirect costs associated with the nature of the illness, its resistance to treatment and the consequences of relapse. Long-acting risperidone is a new formulation of an atypical antipsychotic drug that also offers the improvements in compliance associated with haloperidol depot. The aim of this simulation study was to compare the benefits and costs of three pharmacological treatment strategies comprising first-line treatment with long-acting risperidone injection, a haloperidol depot or an oral atypical antipsychotic agent, over a 5-year period in Germany. A discrete event simulation model was developed to compare three treatment scenarios from the perspective of major third-party payers (sickness funds and social security 'Sozialversicherung'). The scenarios comprised first-line treatment with haloperidol depot (scenario 1), long-acting risperidone (scenario 2) and oral olanzapine (scenario 3). Switches to second or third-line options were allowed when side-effects occurred or a patient suffered more than a fixed number of relapses. The model accounted for fixed patient characteristics, and on the basis of these, simulated patient histories according to several time-dependent variables. The time horizon for this model was limited to 5 years, and in accordance with German guidelines, costs and effects were discounted by between 3 and 10%. Direct costs included medication, type of physician visits and treatment location. Indirect costs were not included. Information on treatment alternatives, transition probabilities, model structure and healthcare utilization were derived from the literature and an expert panel. Outcomes were expressed in terms of the number and duration of psychotic episodes, cumulative symptom scores, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Univariate sensitivity analyses were carried out, as were subgroup analyses based on disease severity and for patients at high risk of being non-compliant. The long-acting risperidone strategy was calculated to avoid 0.23 and 0.33 relapses per patient, decrease the cumulative symptom score by 25 and 33 points, and decrease the costs by 2017 Euro and 6096 Euro per patient (1608 Euro and 5422 Euro discounted), compared with the haloperidol depot and olanzapine strategies, respectively, over a 5-year period (year of costing 2004). Among high-risk non-compliant patients, long-acting risperidone was estimated to avoid 0.23 and 0.47 relapses and save 4822 Euro and 10,646 Euro per patient (4107 Euro and 9490 Euro discounted), compared with the haloperidol depot and olanzapine strategies, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust and mainly sensitive to changes in the reported relative effectiveness of atypical and conventional formulations for preventing symptom recurrence, and in the relative compliance with oral and long-acting formulations. In this model, long-acting risperidone is a dominant strategy compared with a haloperidol depot or oral atypical antipsychotic agent, being both more effective and less costly over a 5-year period. Results for long-acting risperidone are even more favourable among patients at high risk of being noncompliant or with more severe disease.", 
    "142": "Patients with schizophrenia suffer numerous relapses and rehospitalizations that are associated with high direct and indirect medical expense. Suboptimal therapeutic efficacy and, in particular, problems with compliance are major factors leading to relapse. Atypical antipsychotic agents offer improved efficacy and a lower rate of extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with conventional antipsychotic drugs. Long-acting intramuscular risperidone combines these benefits with improvements in compliance associated with depot injections. To assist decision making regarding the place of long-acting risperidone in therapy, a cost-effectiveness analysis of strategies involving first-line treatment with long-acting risperidone, oral olanzapine or depot haloperidol was performed from the perspective of the Belgian healthcare system. A decision tree model was created to compare the cost effectiveness of three first-line treatment strategies in a sample of young schizophrenic patients who had been treated for 1 year and whose disease had not been diagnosed for longer than 5 years. The model used a time horizon of 2 years, with health state transition probabilities, resource use and cost estimates derived from clinical trials, expert opinion and published prices. The four health states in the model were derived from an analysis of the literature. The principal efficacy measure was the proportion of patients successfully treated, defined as those who responded to initial treatment and who had none to two episodes of clinical deterioration without needing a change of treatment over the 2-year period. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the model. A greater proportion of patients were successfully treated with long-acting risperidone (82.7%) for 2 years, compared with those treated with olanzapine (74.8%) or haloperidol (57.3%). Total mean costs per patient over 2 years were 16,406 Euro with long-acting risperidone, 17,074 Euro with olanzapine and 21,779 Euro with haloperidol (year of costing 2003). The mean cost-effectiveness ratios were 19,839 Euro, 22,826 Euro and 38,008 Euro per successfully treated patient for long-acting risperidone, olanzapine and haloperidol, respectively. Results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed that the results were robust to a wide variation of different input variables (effectiveness, dosing distribution, patient status according to healthcare system). Long-acting risperidone was the dominant strategy, being both more effective and less costly than either oral olanzapine or depot haloperidol. Long-acting risperidone appears to represent a favourable first-line strategy for patients with schizophrenia requiring long-term maintenance treatment.", 
    "143": "Lithium (Eskalith) is commonly used in the treatment of depressive and bipolar affective disorders, in a population at relatively high risk for overdose. Lithium may help correct a chemical imbalance in the brain; however, it has a comparatively narrow therapeutic index. Thus, lithium intoxication is a frequent complication of chronic lithium therapy. The central nervous system (CNS) is the major organ system affected, although the renal, gastrointestinal (GI), endocrine, and cardiovascular (CV) systems also may be involved. Here we present a forty-two-year-old Caucasian female with altered mental status, inability to eat, speak or walk properly, with shaking and vomiting for three days. Past medical history was significant for hepatitis C and bipolar disorder. Vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed a patient with aphasia, tremor, and an expressionless face, able to make eye contact and move all four extremities. However, she was unable to follow commands and she expressed rigidity of extremities, mild tachycardia, and stupor. Severely elevated serum lithium levels were found. A diagnosis of severe lithium toxicity was made and the patient was admitted to the telemetry unit. Intravenous hydration with normal saline was initiated as the patient had normal kidney function, and urinary output was monitored. All psychotropic medications were held except for a benzodiazepine. In the meantime the patient developed acute respiratory distress, was intubated on clinical grounds and was transferred to the intensive care unit. Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and other causes of respiratory distress were ruled out; diagnosis of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was made. After two months of mechanical ventilation, the patient was stabilized. Mental status, vital signs, and all laboratory parameters including thyroid function tests, normalized. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation center. This is a rare case of ARDS associated with lithium intoxication.",

An audit to examine the implications of the implementation of the CSM guidance was undertaken.",

Data on clinical and demographic features, patient and carer involvement in the review and clinical outcome of the efficacy of the overall treatment package at 6 month follow-up was ascertained from the case-notes.", 
    "146": "The main findings were: (i) all patients receiving risperidone or olanzapine were identified and reviewed at a median interval of 8 days after the CSM guidance; (ii) most patients and carers were involved in the initial review; (iii) risperidone and olanzapine were discontinued in 22 and 12 of the patients respectively, and in 19 of these patients another neuroleptic was substituted; (iv) there was no relationship between discontinuation of these two drugs and presence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk factors; and, (v) there was no relationship between the clinical outcome of efficacy at six months and discontinuation of these two drugs.", 
    "147": "This study illustrates that it is possible to identify, review and follow-up patients on these two drugs and involve the patient and carer in the review, and clinical outcome of efficacy of the overall treatment package is not adversely affected by continuation or discontinuation of these two drugs.",

There were no clinical or demographic differences between the groups. Parkinsonism, positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia improved in both groups both from baseline switch to olanzapine or risperidone and during the six month follow-up after completion of crossover. No significant differences were seen between groups on most measures. However, patients treated with olanzapine showed a significantly greater improvement in quality of life from baseline compared to risperidone patients.",

    "154": "Consequences of PTSD were investigated in an elderly community-based population (LASA study) by comparing three groups: subjects with PTSD, with subthreshold PTSD, and a reference group. Indicators of well-being (loneliness, self-perceived health and satisfaction with life), disability (days spent in bed and disability days) and use of health care (general practitioners, medical specialists, psychiatrists, mental health care, social workers and professional home care) were investigated.", 
    "155": "In comparison to the reference group, subjects with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD spent more days in bed due to illness and had more disability days, even when corrected for concurring other diseases or functional limitations. They were less satisfied with life in general, used health care for predominantly somatic care and evaluated the care they received to be inadequate. Psychotropic drugs, if prescribed, were predominantly benzodiazepines and seldom antidepressants.", 
    "156": "The findings strongly suggest that elderly with either PTSD or subthreshold PTSD suffer grave impairments in daily life, are less satisfied with life and do not receive optimum treatment. Especially elderly with PTSD frequently visit medical specialists but are rarely treated by psychiatrists or other mental health professionals, nor do they receive antidepressant treatment from their GP. Lack of adequate treatment may be the cause of dissatisfaction with the care they receive.",

Each trial was performed using an open, randomized, cross-over design with an interval of more than 2 weeks between trials. Blood samples were obtained during the 24-h period immediately following the administration of each dose. Pharmacodynamic effects were determined by the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and utilizing a visual analog scale.",

The area under the curve (AUC)(0-24) of triazolam significantly increased by 96% (p<0.05). The AUC(0-24) of quazepam (+38%) and 2-oxoquazepam (+28%) also increased; however, these increases were not significantly different from those of triazolam. GFJ deteriorated the performance of the subjects in the DSST after the triazolam dose (-11 digits at 2 h after the dose, p<0.05), but not after the quazepam dose. Triazolam and quazepam produced similar sedative-like effects, none of which were enhanced by GFJ.", 
    "160": "These results suggest that the effects of GFJ on the pharmacodynamics of triazolam are greater than those on quazepam. These GFJ-related different effects are partly explained by the fact that triazolam is presystemically metabolized by CYP3A4, while quazepam is presystemically metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.",

The oral AUCs for midazolam were predicted from HLM data to increase 16.6, 5.3, 4.6, 1.6 and 1.2-fold due to the inhibition of metabolic clearance by troleandomycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin and azithromycin, respectively.

In this 12-week, open-label study, 31 adult outpatients with treatment-resistant PD who had previously failed to respond to SSRI treatment were treated with fixed dose of olanzapine (5 mg/d) in addition to SSRI. Efficacy was assessed using the Panic Attack and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale (PAAAS), the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). Twenty-six patients completed the trial period with a dropout rate of 16.1%. At week 12, 21 patients were responders (81.8%), and an overall improvement on all rating scales was observed in all patients both with or without agoraphobia. Fifteen patients (57.7%) achieved remission. Olanzapine was well tolerated and the most frequent adverse effects were mild-to-moderate weight gain and drowsiness. No extrapyramidal symptoms were reported. Olanzapine appears to be effective as augmentation strategy in the treatment of SSRI-resistant PD, but study limitations must be considered and placebo-controlled studies are needed.", 
    "166": "This secondary report from our 52-week, double-blind, relapse prevention trial tested whether stable patients with schizophrenia who were taken off active drug treatment would experience greater improvements in long-term quality of life than those who were continued on antipsychotic treatment. On average, Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality-of-Life Scale total scores improved by 4.3 +/- 10.6 points during treatment with olanzapine (10-20 mg/d; n = 212), but decreased by 7.1 +/- 14.6 points during treatment with placebo (n = 92; P < 0.001). Mean Quality-of-Life Scale total scores worsened in both treatment groups for the relapsing patient subgroup, whereas for nonrelapsing patients, those treated with olanzapine had significantly improved mean Quality-of-Life Scale total scores compared with those given placebo. For a subset of nonrelapsing patients who were considered \"nonexacerbating\" on the basis of minimal non-clinically relevant increases in psychopathology, Quality-of-Life Scale total mean change was no better (P = 0.066) for those given placebo (2.7 +/- 11.0; n = 40) than those treated with olanzapine (5.7 +/- 8.9; n = 174). Path analysis indicated a direct effect of treatment (approximately 29%) on quality of life that was not accounted for by differential changes in psychopathology. In conclusion, stable patients with schizophrenia who were taken off active drug treatment experienced no greater improvements in long-term quality of life than those who were continued on antipsychotic treatment, even in the absence of psychotic symptoms.",

    "171": "Triazolam is increasing in popularity as a premedication prescribed by dentists to help their fearful and anxious patients tolerate the potentially aversive nature of some dental procedures. Recent anecdotal reports suggest that incremental sublingual dosing of triazolam may be an effective technique for producing conscious sedation in the dental setting. Although promising, no laboratory or clinical data have been available to evaluate the efficacy or safety of this approach. This study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetics and sedative effects of incremental sublingual dosing of triazolam (total, 1.0 mg) in healthy adults. Ten healthy adult volunteers received sublingual triazolam (0.25 mg) followed by additional doses after 60 (0.50 mg) and 90 (0.25 mg) minutes. Plasma triazolam concentrations, clinical effects (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score), and processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index score) were measured intermittently for 3 hours. Plasma triazolam concentrations (mean +/- SD, 5.1 +/- 1.1 ng/mL) and drug effects (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, 2 +/- 1; and the bispectral index score, 62 +/- 16) were greatest in all subjects at the end of the 3-hour evaluation period. Eight of the subjects had Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores consistent with the definition of deep sedation or general anesthesia (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, <3) at some of the later time points in the 180 minutes of data collection. In comparison, 4 of the subjects had bispectral index scores less than 60 during these later time points of data collection. Given the considerable intersubject variability in triazolam concentrations and effects, additional research is needed to assess this multidosing strategy before it can be endorsed as a useful and safe sedation technique for managing fearful and anxious patients in dental practice.",

Vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be associated with improvements in independence and dynamic visual acuity. Community-based vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be efficacious for selected patients, after careful screening, when trained personnel provide intervention. Vestibular rehabilitation has been incorporated into the rehabilitation program for head-injured military personnel who will be returned to duty, and multifactorial balance rehabilitation has been shown to be useful for children with hearing and balance impairments. Virtual reality techniques have made significant advances, so immersive environments have potential for rehabilitation for patients with vestibular disorders and for developing training regimens for astronauts to ameliorate some effects of exposure to microgravity. Driving skill, in general, is affected by use of benzodiazepines. For many patients with vestibular impairments driving is a particularly problematic activity of daily living.",

Studies of driving have provided some insight into the problems of these patients. More work remains to be done on all of these problems.", 
    "175": "A metabolic interaction between stiripentol (STP), an anticonvulsant agent that inhibits the activity of several cytochromes P450 (P450s), and clobazam (CLB), a 1,5-benzodiazepine, used in association with STP in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy was observed in vivo. This interaction was characterized in vitro using cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 (main P450 involved in CLB metabolism) to calculate K(i) and IC(50) of stiripentol in comparison with ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) and omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor). STP inhibited N-demethylation of CLB to N-desmethylclobazam (NCLB) mediated by CYP3A4 (noncompetitively) and CYP2C19 (competitively) with K(i) = 1.59 +/- 0.07 and 0.516 +/- 0.065 microM and IC(50) = 1.58 microM [95% confidence interval (CI95%) = 1.20-2.08] and 3.29 microM (CI95% = 1.87-5.79), respectively. STP inhibited also more strongly the 4'-hydroxylation of NCLB to 4'-hydroxy-N-desmethylclobazam by CYP2C19 [competitive interaction with K(i) = 0.139 +/- 0.025 microM and IC(50) = 0.276 microM (CI95% = 0.206-0.371)]. The inhibitory effect of STP on CLB demethylation by CYP3A4 was much weaker than that of ketoconazole [IC(50) = 0.023 microM (CI95% = 0.016-0.033)], whereas its effect on NCLB hydroxylation by CYP2C19 was much higher than that of omeprazole [IC(50) = 2.99 microM (CI95% = 2.11-4.24)]. The major in vitro inhibitory effect of STP on CLB metabolism and mostly on NCLB biotransformation is consistent with the changes in vivo in CLB and NCLB plasma concentrations in children treated by the association CLB/STP.", 
    "176": "There have been very limited reports on the effects of commercial fruit juices on human CYP3A activity. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of readily available commercial fruit juices on midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity, a marker of CYP3A, were evaluated in pooled human liver microsomes. The fruit juices investigated were black raspberry, black mulberry, plum, and wild grape. White grapefruit, pomegranate, and orange juice were used as positive and negative controls. The black mulberry juice showed the most potent inhibition of CYP3A except for grapefruit juice. The inhibition depended on the amount of a fruit juice added to the incubation mixture. The inhibitory potential of human CYP3A was in the order: grapefruit > black mulberry > wild grape > pomegranate > black raspberry. The IC(50) values of all fruit juices tested were reduced after preincubation with microsomes in the presence of the NADPH-generating system, suggesting that a mechanism-based inhibitory component was present in these fruit juices, as in the case of grapefruit. The results suggest that, like grapefruit juice, commercial fruit juices also have the potential to inhibit CYP3A-catalzyed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation. Therefore, in vivo studies investigating the interactions between fruit juices such as black mulberry and wild grape and CYP3A substrates are necessary to determine whether inhibition of CYP3A activity by fruit juices is clinically relevant.", 
    "177": "Many viruses inhibit or retard apoptosis, a strategy that subverts one of the most ancient antiviral mechanisms. M11L, a myxoma virus-encoded antiapoptotic protein, has been previously shown to localize to mitochondria and block apoptosis of virus-infected cells (H. Everett, M. Barry, S. F. Lee, X. J. Sun, K. Graham, J. Stone, R. C. Bleackley, and G. McFadden, J. Exp. Med. 191:1487-1498, 2000; H. Everett, M. Barry, X. Sun, S. F. Lee, C. Frantz, L. G. Berthiaume, G. McFadden, and R. C. Bleackley, J. Exp. Med. 196:1127-1139, 2002; and G. Wang, J. W. Barrett, S. H. Nazarian, H. Everett, X. Gao, C. Bleackley, K. Colwill, M. F. Moran, and G. McFadden, J. Virol. 78:7097-7111, 2004). This protection from apoptosis involves constitutive-forming inhibitory complexes with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and Bak on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Here, we extend the study to investigate the interference of M11L with Bax activation during the process of apoptosis. Myxoma virus infection triggers an early apoptotic signal that induces rapid Bax translocation from cytoplasm to mitochondria, despite the existence of various viral antiapoptotic proteins. However, in the presence of M11L, the structural activation of Bax at the mitochondrial membrane, which is characterized by the occurrence of a Bax conformational change, is blocked in both M11L-expressing myxoma-infected cells and M11L-transfected cells under apoptotic stimulation. In addition, inducible binding of M11L to the mitochondrially localized Bax is detected in myxoma virus-infected cells and in M11L/Bax-cotransfected cells as measured by immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification analysis, respectively. Importantly, this inducible Bax/M11L interaction is independent of Bak, demonstrated by the complete block of Bax-mediated apoptosis in myxoma-infected cells that lack Bak expression. Our findings reveal that myxoma M11L modulates apoptosis by multiple independent strategies which all contribute to the blockade of apoptosis at the mitochondrial checkpoint.", 
    "178": "In the previous study of the rat frontal cortex slices oxygen consumption (QO2), polarographically determined using the biological oxygen monitor, a moderate respiratory depressant action of midazolam ex vivo (1.0 mg/kg) has been observed. Antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site, flumazenil, blocked the effect of the agonist. However, midazolam-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interactions pointed to the possibility that a part of midazolam action is independent of the classical GABA potentiation. To test this presumption, GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin were administered. Both blockers antagonized the QO2 reducing effect of the combination of per se effective doses of midazolam (1.0 mg/kg) and GABA (5 x 10(-4) mol/l), as well as of GABA (5 x 10(-4) mol/l) itself. However, neither effects of midazolam (1.0 mg/kg) on its own, nor those of midazolam in presence of the physiological, per se ineffective, concentration of GABA (10(-6) mol/l), were susceptible to antagonism. These results show that ex vivo influence of midazolam on cerebral metabolic activity should be partly ascribed to some of its cellular mechanisms probably associated to the GABA modulation, but distinct from the standard GABA-potentiating effects of benzodiazepines.",

In Argentina it grows in neotropical rainforest (Ntr C.p.) and in a temperate region (Tp C.p.). In a previous work we showed their hypotensive properties with different potency and toxicity, and now we studied the Tp C.p. effects in isolated heart from rats and central effects of both plants on the open-field test for mice. Tp C.p. produced a positive inotropic effect on isolated rat hearts, which was not affected by 1 microM propranolol, suggesting that it is not due to a beta-adrenergic effect. In contrast, it was prevented by pretreatment with high [K](o) media, which stimulates the Na,K-ATPase pump, suggesting an inhibition of the pump by \"ambay\", as digital do. In the open-field test, both Ntr C.p. and Tp C.p. similarly decreased the spontaneous locomotion and exploratory behavior of mice at doses between 180 and 600 mg/kg. Ntr C.p. potentiated the effect of 3 mg/kg diazepam to one similar to 10 mg/kg diazepam, but was not antagonized by 0.5 mg/kg flumazenil. Amphetamine at 5 mg/kg prevented the sedative effect of Ntr C.p. Chromatographic analysis showed that both plants have a qualitatively similar fingerprint but quantitatively differed in at least three components. Although the purpose was not to identify them, both plants have at least 10 compounds. Two of them were in higher amount in Tp C.p. than in Ntr C.p., and then, they could be responsible for the cardiovascular toxicity of Tp C.p. In conclusion, the results suggest that ambay has cardiotonic and sedative properties. The sedative effect could be useful in cough treatment. The extract resulted additive to benzodiazepines but it did not bind to the same site on GABA-A receptor, and it was interfered by the dopamine release produced with amphetamine.",

We pharmacologically identified the anxiolytic components in ginseng root, using the elevated plus-maze test. Male ICR albino mice and the following drugs were used: diazepam (0.5, 1 and 1.5 mg/kg, p.o.); red ginseng powder (300, 600 and 1200 mg/kg, p.o.); crude saponin and non-saponin ginseng fractions (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p., for each preparation); and pure ginsenoside Rb1, Rg1, and Ro (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p., for each preparation). Ginseng powder and crude saponin ginseng fraction significantly increased the frequency and duration of open arm entries. Among the three types of pure ginsenoside, only ginsenoside Rb1 significantly increased both the frequency and duration of open arm entries. Our results clearly indicate that ginsenoside Rb1 is one of the active anxiolytic components of ginseng root.", 
    "185": "Researchers have recently become aware of the importance of including women in research, including drug abuse research. With this increased awareness has come an increased scientific interest in the potential influence of menstrual cycle phase on responses to drugs. In this review, we discuss recent studies that have examined subjective and physiological responses to drugs of abuse in relation to menstrual cycle phase. With most of the drugs reviewed, including alcohol, benzodiazepines, caffeine, marijuana, nicotine and opioids, responses to the drugs were not different were inconsistent across cycle phases. However, with psychomotor stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine and cocaine, responses to the drugs were greater during the follicular, compared to the luteal, phase of the cycle. These findings suggest that, consistent with certain pre-clinical findings, circulating levels of ovarian hormones influence the central effects of stimulant drugs in women. With other drugs, the evidence to date suggests that ovarian hormones have modest, if any, effects on responses to abused drugs. We discuss methodological issues relating to inclusion of women with regular menstrual cycles.",

The ability to carry out an initial drug screen on vitreous humor at the earliest stage of the death investigation process could contribute significantly to the assessment of the role drugs may have played prior to confirmation with toxicological analyses at the laboratory. Vitreous humor (n = 146) was collected from autopsy examinations (111 males and 35 females) with a specific focus on cases where death occurred following a road traffic accident or where an overdose was suspected. All samples were screened using the five-panel methadone Cozart RapiScan Cartridge with an overall positive rate of 29%. Of the positive results, 43% screened positive for benzodiazepines, 17% for cocaine, 7% for methadone and 33% for opiates. Positive samples, with the exception of benzodiazepines, and 20% of negative samples were analysed by GC/MS. This is the first reported use of this system as an on-site forensic tool in death investigation and for screening for drugs of abuse in vitreous humor. The conclusions from this study show that the Cozart RapiScan System could play an important role in obtaining information on the toxicological state of the person at the time of death.",

Surgery for the first hemisphere was complicated by intracranial hemorrhage requiring an emergency craniotomy. The case highlights the importance of understanding Fontan physiology and its interrelationship with the cerebral circulation in the setting of cerebrovascular insufficiency and raised intracranial pressure.", 
    "192": "A method involving high-performance liquid chromatography with dual-electrode electrochemical detection in the redox mode (LC-DED) has been successfully developed for the determination of the benzodiazepine tranquilizer, nitrazepam, in serum. To elucidate the electrochemical mechanism occurring at a glassy carbon electrode, cyclic voltammetry was preformed with 1 mM solutions of nitrazepam at pH values between 2 and 12, using a potential range from -1.5 to +1.5 V. Two reduction peaks were observed over the whole pH range; the first, designated R1, was consistent with the 4e-, 4H+ reduction of the 7-nitro group to a hydroxylamine species; the second more negative peak, designated R2, was shown to be the result of a 2e-, 2H+ reduction of the 4-5 azomethine group. On the reverse anodic scan, an oxidation signal was observed, designated O1, which was considered to result from a 2e-, 2H+ oxidation of the hydroxylamine to a nitroso group. On the second forward scan, a new reduction peak, designated R3, was observed, which was considered to result from reduction of the nitroso species back to the hydroxylamine species. Studies were then undertaken to exploit the hydroxylamine/nitroso redox couple using LC-DED detection for the measurement of nitrazepam in serum. The optimal chromatographic conditions were found to comprise a mobile phase containing 60% methanol, 40% 50 mM pH 4.1 acetate buffer, in conjunction with a Hypersil C18 250 mm x 4.6 mm column. Hydrodynamic voltammetric studies were undertaken to optimize the operating potentials required for dual-electrode detection. It was found that an applied potential of -2.4 V was optimum for the \"generator\" cell and +0.5 V for the \"detector\" cell. The proposed method was evaluated by carrying out replicate nitrazepam determinations on spiked bovine and human serum samples. The former evaluation was preformed at a concentration of 11.2 microg mL(-1), and the latter at 1670 ng mL(-1). For bovine serum, the recovery of nitrazepam was found to be 75.8% and the associated coefficient of variation was 6.1% (n = 6). For human serum, the recovery was 74.1% with a coefficient of variation of 7.8% (n = 7). These data suggest that the method holds promise for applications in toxicology and where an alternative reliable method to confirm drug abuse may be required.",
