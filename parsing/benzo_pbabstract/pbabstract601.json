Similarly, mice previously exposed to a no-choice intake of ethanol showed a significant decrease in ethanol preference when tested subsequently. A long-lasting (greater than 20 weeks) reduction in ethanol selection developed after mice were previously exposed to ethanol/CDP in a no-choice condition. This was also accompanied by a decrease in the subsequent selection of ethanol/CDP, but not CDP. The exact mechanisms for the long-lasting decrease in ethanol selection was unknown, but it was not due to the development of fluid aversion. It is suggested that the combined central effects of ethanol/CDP might be partially responsible.", 
    "1": "Effects of psychotropic drugs on the rage responses induced by electrical stimulation were investigated in cats with electrodes chronically implanted in the medial hypothalamus. Diazepam produced marked elevation in the threshold for directed attack and slight elevation in that for hissing. The inhibitory effect of etizolam on hissing was about 6 times as potent as that of diazepam. Anti-anxiety drugs such as diazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam, clotiazepam and etizolam produced marked elevation in the directed attack threshold dose-dependently. The effect of chlorpromazine on directed attack was far less potent than that of anti-anxiety drugs. The anti-anxiety drugs used in this experiment had anti-pentetrazol activity in mice as well as muscle relaxant activity in cats. There were close correlations between the directed attack inhibition produced by the anti-anxiety drugs and both anti-pentetrazol activity and muscle relaxant activity. These results indicate that the above anti-anxiety drugs have a more potent inhibitory effect on the function of the medial hypothalamus than neuroleptic drugs. The inhibitory effect of anti-anxiety drugs on directed attack may be considered to correlate with clinical anti-anxiety effects.", 
    "2": "Effects of flurazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, on Ca2+-induced cardio-stimulant contractile activity in normal Tyrode's solution and Ca2+-mediated contraction in K+-rich (19-22 mM) Tyrode's solution were investigated in electrically driven left atrial preparations isolated from guinea-pigs. In normal Tyrode's solution, flurazepam (1 X 10(-6), 1 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M) noncompetitively shifted the dose-response curves for CaCl2 downwards. In K+ (19 mM)-rich Tyrode's solution, flurazepam (3 X 10(-5) M) decreased contractile amplitude time-dependently; and after addition of CaCl2 (final: 8 mM), contractile amplitude was increased time-dependently. In K+ (19 mM)-depolarized preparations, flurazepam (3 X 10(-5) M) competitively shifted the dose-response curve for CaCl2 rightwards. In the K+ (22 mM)-depolarized isoproterenol (3.8 X 10(-6) M)-treated atrial preparation, flurazepam (3 X 10(-5) M) consistently suppressed contraction. Flurazepam (9 X 10(-5) M) suppressed atrial contraction in tetrodotoxin (TTX) (2 X 10(-5) M)-added normal Tyrode's solution, and CaCl2 (final: 8 mM) partially restored the contraction. These results suggest that flurazepam inhibits transmembrane Ca2+-influx into the atrial muscle cell.", 
    "3": "Hypothermic action of neurotropic drugs (Oxotremorine, Nicotine, Isoprenaline, Seduxene) is evaluated by means of suppression of shivering thermogenesis. The action is accounted for by their influence of the brain stem level of the postural muscular tension regulation rather than by selective action of these drugs on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre.", 
    "4": "This paper reports five movement disorders cases to serve as a basis for discussion of the problems encountered in the clinical management of these cases, and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in these disorders as presented. Case 1 is a description of the subjective experience of a patient with acute orofacial dystonia from promethazine. Case 2 is the use of clonazepam is post-head injury tics. Case 3 is the complication from discontinuation of haloperidol and benztropine mesylate treatment. Case 4 is myoclonus in subacute sclerosing Panencephalitis, and Case 5 is rebound tremor from withdrawal of a beta-adrenergic blocker.", 
    "5": "The effect of pretreatment with barbiturates or diazepam on the in vivo metabolism of halothane or enflurane (92 ppm) was investigated upon application by inhalation. In male rats exposed to halothane the elimination half-life from the atmosphere of the closed exposure system amounted to 0.64 h; pretreatment with thiopental or methohexital (40 mg/kg i.p.) caused a small, but significant prolongation of the half-life (1.3 or 1.4-fold), whereas hexobarbital (75 or 100 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect in this respect. Much stronger and dose-dependent effects were seen in rats pretreated with pentobarbital (25 or 50 mg/kg i.p.; 2 or 3-fold) or diazepam (5 or 10 mg/kg i.p.; 3 or 5-fold increase). In control rats exposed to enflurane the elimination half-life was 4.77 h; pretreatment with hexobarbital, thiopental or methohexital at the above doses did not alter this value, whereas pentobarbital and diazepam again exerted marked and dose-dependent effects: a 1.5 or 1.7-fold prolongation of the half-life was observed after pentobarbital (25 or 50 mg/kg i.p.) and a 1.9 or 3.3-fold prolongation after diazepam (5 or 10 mg/kg i.p.), respectively. These different effects of the pretreatment drugs seems to correlate with their own pathways and rates of metabolism.", 
    "6": "The mutagenic effect of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride was evaluated in the bone-marrow cells of Swiss mice by the micronucleus test. A comparative study of the drug was made by oral and intraperitoneal administrations containing 187.5, 375 and 562 mg/kg body weight and 67, 134 and 201 mg/kg body weight respectively, corresponding to three sublethal doses of 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 LD50, respectively. Bone-marrow preparations were made and slides scored for the presence of micronuclei in the developing erythrocytes. The results showed that the drug chlordiazepoxide induced a significant increase of micronuclei in the polychromatic erythrocytes by both routes of administration.", 
    "7": "Experiments were conducted to assess the relative roles of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and adenosine in mediating the inhibition of neuronal activity by diazepam injected intravenously. Recent studies have shown that benzodiazepines inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, the firing of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. In support of a predominantly GABAergic mechanism for this inhibitory action, a small dose of diazepam (50 micrograms/kg, i.v.), which itself had little effect on cell firing, significantly potentiated the inhibitory responses of neurons of the pars reticulata to muscimol, a potent GABA agonist given intravenously, and significantly and selectively potentiated the inhibition of reticulata neurons by GABA applied iontophoretically. In contrast to their extreme sensitivity to GABAergic inhibition, neurons of the pars reticulata were comparatively insensitive to systemically and iontophoretically administered adenosine-related drugs. However, in those instances when inhibitions could be achieved with iontophoretically applied adenosine-5'-monophosphate, the inhibitory responses were not significantly modified by a 50 micrograms/kg (i.v.) dose of diazepam. These findings, considered in light of differences in GABA and adenosine receptor densities within the substantia nigra, suggest that the benzodiazepine-induced inhibition of neurons of the nigral pars reticulata most likely involves potentiation of GABA but not adenosine-mediated influences.", 
    "8": "Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine. It is more potent and has a shorter duration of action than diazepam. Forty patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the first time were randomized to receive either diazepam or midazolam as the preendoscopic sedative agent. Both the patient and the endoscopist were blinded regarding the treatment group. Vital signs were monitored before, during, and after induction. Questionnaires were used to assess patient recall of the procedure, as well as endoscopist and patient satisfaction. Recovery from sedation was assessed using the Treiger test (i.e., connecting a series of sequential points with a line). Twenty-four hours and 1 to 2 weeks later, follow-up was obtained on all patients to evaluate for any delayed adverse effects. When compared to diazepam, midazolam was more potent and decreased induction time by more than 2.5 min (p less than 0.001). Recovery time and endoscopist and patient satisfaction were similar (p greater than 0.1), but patient recall was significantly less in the midazolam group (p less than 0.01). Fewer adverse reactions (e.g., thrombophlebitis) were noted with midazolam; however, the magnitude of the difference was not statistically significant. Hemodynamic parameters were also similar. It is concluded that midazolam is a safe, effective, and promptly acting sedative for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Compared to diazepam it was significantly more potent, faster acting, and associated with greater amnesia.", 
    "9": "The influence of dantrolene, diazepam, pentobarbital and 4-aminopyridine on the depressant effect of active shortening during twitch and tetanus was investigated in isolated muscle fibres of the frog. These drugs are all presumed to alter the kinetics of the release and re-uptake of activator calcium during the excitation-contraction process. The shortening induced depression was calculated as the difference in redeveloped force after a small (control) and a larger (test) release step and was expressed in per cent of the control. The depressant effect in response to a given amount of shortening during twitch contraction as well as during the plateau of a tetanus was approximately doubled after addition of 10 microM dantrolene. In contrast, diazepam (150 microM) reduced the shortening effect during the twitch to about one tenth of the value obtained in ordinary Ringer solution, while the force depression by shortening during tetanic stimulation remained essentially unaltered. Pentobarbital (1.0 mM) reduced the shortening induced depression during the twitch by 95-100%. 4-aminopyridine (3.0 mM) completely abolished the depressant effect of shortening obtained during the twitch and approximately halved the shortening effect during tetanic contraction.", 
    "10": "For an analysis of the risk factors for stress bleeding, 24 risk factors selected from 202 clinical parameters were analysed, and their values determined in 586 medical and surgical intensive-care patients treated for at least six days between 1975 and 1980, who received no prophylactic medication. In 420 patients who received a prophylactic treatment with 800 mg or 1200 mg cimetidine, 2-hourly 30 ml antacids or 30 mg pirenzepine individually or in combination, the total risk scores were determined as the sum of the risk factors. This risk score served as the unit for comparison of the prophylaxis groups. Combined medication with two or three drugs proved to be significantly superior to treatment with either of the medicaments given alone.",

    "14": "A possible antimanic efficacy of the GABA-ergic anticonvulsant valproate was examined by use of a double-blind, placebo-controlled ABA design. A marked improvement was observed after valproate medication in a group of 5 acutely ill manic patients. Similar results were obtained in 7 trials examining the antimanic property of the keto-derivative of carbamazepine (oxcarbazepine) in 6 patients with acute mania, whereas no antimanic effect could be observed in a treatment with diazepam and with THIP. Combination of THIP and diazepam in another patient showed a slight antimanic effect. Additionally, a possible prophylactic effect of long-term treatment using valproate was examined. In 8 of 9 patients exhibiting a bipolar affective or schizoaffective psychosis, who did not properly respond to lithium treatment, a prophylactic effect of valproate medication could be demonstrated. The results point to the view that anticonvulsants, possibly due to GABA-ergic effects, may be beneficial in affective disorders.", 
    "15": "Six obese (mean weight 92 kg) and five normal (60 kg) subjects received 2 mg diazepam nightly for 30 nights. Determination of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam plasma concentrations during the dosing period and for a withdrawal period indicated that accumulation half-life for both diazepam (7.8 days in obese vs. 3.1 days in normal subjects, P less than 0.05) and desmethyldiazepam (30.3 vs. 7.2 days, P less than 0.05) was markedly prolonged in obese subjects. However, mean steady-state plasma concentrations of diazepam (68 vs. 67 ng/ml) and desmethyldiazepam (156 vs. 91 ng/ml) did not significantly differ between groups. To determine the basis for this delay in accumulation in obese subjects, single-dose pharmacokinetics of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were determined. Diazepam elimination half-life was greatly prolonged in the obese subjects (82 vs. 32 hours, P less than 0.005), with no change in total metabolic clearance (32 vs. 26 ml/min). Instead, a large increase in volume of distribution (228 vs. 70 liters, P less than 0.01) was the reason for prolongation of the elimination half-life. Similarly for desmethyldiazepam, elimination half-life was prolonged in obese subjects (130 vs. 56 hours, P less than 0.01), without a change in total metabolic clearance (13.7 vs. 19.2 ml/min), due to increased volume of distribution (151 vs. 73 liters, P less than 0.01). During chronic dosing with diazepam, obese patients may experience a much slower onset of maximal drug effect compared to normal-weight patients because of the greatly delayed accumulation of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "By using a push-pull cannula technique and an isotopic method for the estimation of [3H]serotonin continuously synthetized from [3H]tryptophan, the effects of a benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, were investigated on the in vivo release of [3H]serotonin in the cat basal ganglia. Chlordiazepoxide injection (10 mg/kg i.p.) decreased striatal and nigral [3H]serotonin release and enhanced the [3H]amine release in the dorsal raphe. These changes were blocked by the continuous superfusion of the dorsal raphe with Ro 15-1788 (10(-5) M), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Chlordiazepoxide (10(-5) M) applied to the dorsal raphe reduced nigral [3H]serotonin release while decreasing [3H]serotonin release locally in the dorsal raphe. Furthermore, the superfusion of serotonergic nerve terminals of the substantia nigra or the caudate nucleus with chlordiazepoxide (10(-5) M) never altered the local release of [3H]serotonin. These data strongly suggest that the (inhibitory) influences exerted by chlordiazepoxide on serotonergic transmission more likely involved cell bodies and/or dendrites rather than terminals of serotonergic neurons. Chlordiazepoxide-induced changes in [3H]serotonin release were only observed in \"enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9\" and not in halothane-anesthetized cats. Further experiments revealed that GABAergic neurons of the dorsal raphe could participate to such a differential reactivity of serotonergic cells to chlordiazepoxide. For instance, [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid release in the dorsal raphe was enhanced by halothane anesthesia. These findings further suggest the possibility that the influence exerted by benzodiazepines on serotonergic transmission, perhaps through a gamma-aminobutyric acid-dependent process, can significantly be involved in the pharmacological actions of these drugs.", 
    "17": "The in vitro protein binding of diazepam and its major plasma metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam (DMD), was measured in women at full term of pregnancy, in mixed cord plasma (fetal plasma), and in control subjects. The free fraction of both drugs was determined by ultrafiltration at 37 degrees. The mean free fraction of diazepam was 0.023 +/- 0.0043 in control subjects and rose to 0.040 +/- 0.0071 in women at term, whereas in their fetuses the free fraction was 0.021 +/- 0.0057. The unbound fraction of DMD was 0.030 +/- 0.0084 in control subjects, 0.052 +/- 0.015 in women at term, and 0.035 +/- 0.010 in fetal plasma. The free fractions of both compounds differed in women at term and in their fetuses. The higher free fraction of the two drugs in maternal plasma than in cord plasma may be explained by elevated maternal concentrations of free fatty acids (and triglycerides), which may act as displacing agents in maternal plasma. The higher binding of these drugs in fetal plasma than in maternal plasma may explain their cumulation in vivo and may be responsible for the frequently observed adverse effects of maternal diazepam treatment on the newborn infant.", 
    "18": "Pharmacokinetic volumes of distribution (Vd) are commonly calculated either by the steady-state method (Vdss) or the area method (Vdarea). Vdss is traditionally perceived as the least biased and most reliable indicator of the extent of distribution, but Vdss in fact has far greater practical and theoretical limitation than does Vdarea. After single doses or multiple discrete doses of a drug, Vdarea correctly relates plasma concentration to amount of drug in the body at all times after distribution equilibrium is attained. Vdss, on the other hand, is a correct proportionality constant only during continuous intravenous infusion or at a single instant in time after discrete dosing. Furthermore, calculated values of Vdss are strongly dependent on the precise configuration of the initial distributional phase of the plasma concentration curve, which may be difficult or impossible to delineate because of variance arising from methodologic artefacts or unexplained causes. Such variance can lead to large nonphysiologic within- and between-individual variability in Vdss. Vdarea, on the other hand, is relatively independent or artefactual changes in the initial distribution profile. Finally, experimental observations indicate that elimination depends physiologically on distribution in the absence of changes in clearance, not the reverse. The relation of distribution and elimination holds whether the steady-state method or the area method is used to calculate Vd. Thus, Vdarea is a more reliable and generally valid descriptor of the extent of drug distribution than is Vdss.", 
    "19": "A randomised, double-blind trial of atropine, atropine plus papaveretum, and atropine plus diazepam given intramuscularly as premedication for fibreoptic bronchoscopy in 60 patients showed no difference between the three regimens as assessed by bronchoscopist or patient. Bronchoscopists frequently attributed a sedative action to atropine alone and their assessment of tolerance and sedation was more optimistic than that of the patients. In a second study comparing intravenous diazepam (10 mg) with saline, after prior intramuscular atropine (0.6 mg), both the bronchoscopists and the patients noted a significant sedative effect of diazepam, and coughing was reduced by diazepam.", 
    "20": "The effect of ethylenediamine analogues on in vitro binding of [3H]-diazepam to crude cerebral cortical synaptosomal membranes in the rat was studied. Ethylenediamine significantly increased [3H]-diazepam binding to a maximum potentiation of 154% control (EC50 = 1.8 X 10(-4) M) and was the most active compound studied in terms of both potency and the maximum potentiation observed. Potentiation of [3H]-diazepam binding by ethylenediamine analogues is dependent on carbon-chain length, appears to require two terminal amino groups, and is not observed in the rigid analogues studied. Potentiation of [3H]-diazepam binding by ethylenediamine analogues is mediated largely by a change in receptor number and not receptor affinity. Results are discussed in terms of the possible nature of the ethylenediamine binding site.", 
    "21": "Rats were placed on either small (subjected to REM sleep deprivation) or large circular platforms (stress controls) surrounded by water for 96 hours. Six animals from each group were either decapitated immediately following 96 hours or placed in cages and decapitated 6 hours later. Benzodiazepine receptor binding in rat brain cortices and brain stems was assessed using 3H-diazepam as the ligand. Scatchard analysis of these data showed that neither REM sleep deprivation nor REM sleep rebound affected the kinetics of 3H-diazepam binding (Bmax or apparent KD) in vitro.", 
    "22": "The molecular weight of the putative calcium channel in guinea-pig brain membranes, labelled with [3H]-nimodipine, has been determined in situ by target size analysis. Irradiation of guinea-pig brain membranes at 153-173 K with 10 MeV electrons reduced the density of [3H]-nimodipine binding sites without affecting the equilibrium dissociation constant. The decay of the calcium channel blocker binding site density as a function of radiation dose fits to a monoexponential function. Application of the target size theory gives a molecular weight of 185,000. [3H]-Flunitrazepam labelled benzodiazepine receptor target size was measured as an internal control. The molecular weight of the benzodiazepine receptors was 76,000, which is in good agreement with published results.", 
    "23": "In alpha-chloralose anesthetized, immobilized and ventilated cats stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NA) evokes either inhibition or brief excitation followed by inhibition of extracellularly recorded spontaneously active or sural driven units in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). Inhibition peaked 50-80 msec following the onset of NA stimulation and persisted for about 300 msec. Pharmacologic interventions designed to characterize this inhibition were performed. Bicuculline, 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg IV, consistently antagonized NA elicited suppression of SNpr cells. Diazepam 0.5 mg/kg effectively reversed bicuculline actions. Inhibition of spontaneously active units as well as sural excited units was blocked by bicuculline. Strychnine 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg IV failed to affect inhibition arising from NA. These data suggest that, analogous to the GABAergic striatonigral pathway, inhibition of SNpr cells arising from NA utilizes GABA as a transmitter.", 
    "24": "A rater-bind, ABA's design study of 21 cases indicates that diazepam significantly improves tardive dyskinesia and that some of the improvement persists for an extended period after diazepam is withdrawn. Since benzodiazepine receptors and sites of action seem to be mainly in the neocortex (especially frontal), limbic cortex, and deep limbs nuclei, and these structures provide most of the input into the nigrostriatopallidal system that probably regulates its role in voluntary movement, it may be suggested that impaired corticolimbic control of basal ganglia may be a factor in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia.", 
    "25": "Long-term (20 days) treatment with methyl mercury (MeHg) increases the total number of benzodiazepine binding sites and decreases essentially the content of cyclic GMP in the cerebellar cortex. In contrast, this treatment fails to modify the content of GABA and cyclic AMP, GAD activity and GABA binding sites in the same brain area. The changes in cyclic GMP and benzodiazepine binding sites in the cerebellar cortex are discussed in relation to the motor disturbances associated with MeHg intoxication.", 
    "26": "The [3H]PK 11195, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide, binding sites in rat cardiac membranes are saturable, with high affinity, specific GABA-independent and correspond to the peripheral type of benzodiazepine. The order of potency of displacing agents was: PK 11195 greater than RO5-4864 greater than dipyridamole greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam. The Bmax obtained with [3H]PK 11195 was equivalent of the Bmax obtained with [3H]RO5-4864 in the same experimental conditions. However thermodynamic analysis indicates that the [3H]PK 11195 binding was entropy driven whereas the [3H]RO5-4864 binding was enthalpy driven. Consequently PK 11195 might be an antagonist of these binding sites and RO5-4864 an agonist or a partial agonist. The simultaneous use of both drugs might help to elucidate the physiological relevance of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "27": "3H-Flunitrazepam (3H-FLU) binding was measured in multiple brain regions of amygdala-kindled rats two weeks following the sixth Stage 5 convulsion. As compared to 'yoked' controls, the kindled animals displayed significant reductions in 3H-FLU binding in the ipsilateral cortex (20%) and in the hypothalamus (20%). Scatchard plots revealed that these reductions were due to changes in the maximal number of available binding sites (Bmax) rather than to alterations in receptor affinity (KD). No significant changes were found in the contralateral cortex, or in either the contralateral or ipsilateral amygdala, hippocampus or striatum. These data suggest that kindling is associated with long-lasting changes in the benzodiazepine receptor system and possibly with related changes in GABA-mediated neural inhibition.", 
    "28": "3H-Phenytoin binding to the particulate fraction of rat wholebrain homogenate was studied using the filter assay technique. It was found that diazepam and (+)bicuculline methobromide caused a concentration-dependent enhancement of the total binding of 3H-phenytoin, whereas GABA and (-)bicuculline methobromide (the inactive bicuculline isomer) had no effect. In subsequent competition experiments (labelled versus unlabelled phenytoin), it was found that the presence of a potentiating concentration of diazepam transformed the biphasic phenytoin competition isotherm into a simple curve with a Hill coefficient of approximately one, and a Ki of 110 nM.", 
    "29": "(+)Etomidate and pentobarbital enhance [3H]diazepam and [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid [( 3H]GABA) binding to cerebral cortex membranes. Both (+)etomidate and pentobarbital increase the affinity of [3H]diazepam for its binding sites. In contrast, they increase the Bmax of both the high- and low-affinity GABA receptor sites. The enhancement of [3H]diazepam and [3H]GABA by (+)etomidate and pentobarbital is blocked by GABA antagonists. These results indicate that hypnotic drugs such as (+)etomidate and pentobarbital, which are not structurally related, modulate diazepam and GABA binding sites via similar mechanisms.", 
    "30": "DMCM (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) produces convulsions in mice and rats, probably by interacting with benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. Investigation of specific binding of [3H]DMCM to rat hippocampus and cortex revealed polyphasic saturation curves, indicating a high-affinity site (KD = 0.5-0.8 nM) and a site with lower affinity (KD = 3-6 nM). BZ receptor ligands of various chemical classes, but not other agents, displace [3H]DMCM from specific binding sites--indicating that [3H]DMCM binds to BZ receptors in rat brain. The regional distribution of [3H]DMCM binding is complementary to that of the BZ1-selective radioligand [3H]PrCC. Specific binding of [3H]DMCM (0.1 nM) was reduced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist to approximately 20% of the control value at 37 degrees C in chloride-containing buffers; the reduction was bicuculline methiodide- and RU 5135-sensitive. The effective concentrations of 10 GABA analogues in reducing [3H]DMCM binding correlated closely to published values for their GABA receptor affinity. Specific binding of [3H]DMCM is regulated by unknown factors; e.g. enhanced binding was found by Ag+ treatment of membranes, in the presence of picrotoxinin, or by exposure to ultraviolet light in the presence of flunitrazepam. In conclusion, [3H]DMCM appears to bind to high-affinity brain BZ receptors, although the binding properties are different from those of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]PrCC. These differences might relate in part to subclass selectivity and in part to differences in efficacy of DMCM at BZ receptors.", 
    "31": "The effect of phospholipid methylation on both [3H]diazepam and [3H]GABA ( [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid) binding to crude synaptic plasma membrane from rat cerebellum has been studied. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) stimulates [3H]methyl group incorporation into membrane phospholipids and enhances [3H]diazepam binding by increasing the apparent Bmax. Conversely, inhibition of [3H]methyl group transfer from [3H]SAM to phospholipids by preincubation with SAM at 0 degrees C or with SAH abolishes the increase of binding. After preincubation with SAM, analysis of the GABA binding reveals the presence of binding sites with high affinity, a property absent in control membranes preincubated without SAM. Among the neurotransmitter bindings tested, only those of GABA and benzodiazepine in the cerebellum and beta-adrenergic ligands in the cerebral cortex are enhanced upon stimulation of phospholipid methyltransferase activity. [3H]Dihydromorphine, [3H]dihydro-alpha-ergokryptine and [3H]spiroperidol bindings are not affected by SAM. The present data suggest an involvement of phospholipid methylation in regulation of both [3H]GABA and [3H]-diazepam binding.", 
    "32": "Binding of a new selective reversible type A MAO inhibitor cimoxatone (MD 780515) to plasma proteins was studied in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. Binding to 580 microM human serum albumin (HSA) and to total plasma proteins was 93-96% and independent of cimoxatone concentration (0.15-207 microM). The drug was mainly bound to HSA with two binding sites and a moderate association constant (K = 2.9 X 10(4) M-1). Free fatty acids did not modify cimoxatone binding to HSA. Cimoxatone was also moderately bound to isolated lipoprotein fractions; alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and gamma-globulins did not play an important role in the binding of cimoxatone. MD 770222, the O-demethyl metabolite, appeared to be bound to HSA at the same binding sites as cimoxatone. However, no interaction occurred between the two compounds for 580 microM HSA. L-Tryptophan, bilirubin, the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and oxazepam, imipramine and aspirin, did not displace cimoxatone from its binding sites. On the other hand, warfarin and phenylbutazone decreased cimoxatone binding to 29 microM HSA but no interaction occurred with 580 microM HSA.", 
    "33": "The study has been carried out in order to investigate the effects of some drugs in coma doses on the concentration in brain of some amino acids involved in brain function. Six groups of 25 guinea pigs each were utilized. In each of the five groups a subcutaneous dose of diazepam, flunitrazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin or alfaxalone, was injected and one group was utilized as control. Some neurotransmitter amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and taurine) and precursors of neurotransmitters (phenylalanine and tyrosine) were determined in brain preparations. The results are discussed.", 
    "34": "The effects of quazepam, flurazepam and diazepam (0.12-1 mg/kg i.v.) on cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) and EEG power spectra were studied in cats with lesioning at various levels of the brain stem (enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9, midpontine pretrigeminal and cerveau isol\u00e9 preparations). In the enc\u00e9phale isole\u00e9, quazepam produced slow waves, spindles and power increases in the 0.5-14 Hz range. Flurazepam produced similar EEG activity but alternated with fast frequency rhythms (8-14 Hz) of moderate amplitude. Diazepam produced spindles superimposed on a continuous fast frequency background while the slow waves were not observed. In the midpointine cats, quazepam modified the desynchronized EEG only at the higher doses. It enhanced the fast rhythms (10-14 Hz) observed in controls. Flurazepam produced similar effects but to a great extent. EEG effects of diazepam were similar to those observed in the enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9. Thus, the midpontine transection precluded the appearance of the slow wave synchronization. None of the benzodiazepines affected the synchronized EEG of the cerveau isol\u00e9. It is suggested that quazepam and, at least in part, flurazepam may induce EEG synchronization and slow wave sleep by influencing hypnogenic mechanisms of the lower brain stem. Fast EEG patterns produced by diazepam and partially by flurazepam seemed unrelated to the sleep-inducing mechanisms while the activating mesencephalic system appeared to be involved.", 
    "35": "The haemodynamic effects of midazolam 0.25 mg/kg administered intravenously were studied in eight anaesthetized patients suffering from coronary artery disease. Heart rate, systemic and pulmonary pressures, right atrial pressure, capillary pressure and cardiac output were measured 2, 5, 8 and 12 min after injection of midazolam and were compared with reference values collected before the commencement of the haemodynamic test. The cardiovascular condition of all the patients followed the same course after the injection of midazolam. The greatest variations were seen at the twelfth minute, with the exception of capillary pressure where the largest decrease was noted at the eighth minute. These variations, expressed as a percentage of the initial values, were: mean arterial pressure -17% (P less than 0.01); capillary pressure -23.5% (eight minute, P less than 0.01); heart rate - 9% (P less than 0.01); cardiac index -9% (P less than 0.01); systemic vascular resistance -12% (eighth minute, P less than 0.01). The stroke volume was well maintained (+0.1% NS). These haemodynamic variations were accompanied by a favourable evolution of the endocardial viability ratio (EVR), +12% (P less than 0.01). The slight tachycardia occasionally seen on induction of anaesthesia with midazolam was not seen in this group of patients. We conclude that these haemodynamic variations leading to an increase in EVR support the use of midazolam as a supplement to fentanyl anaesthesia for patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "36": "Hemiballism is an involuntary uncontrollable movement disorder with grave prognosis. Post stroke anatomical lesions of the subthalamic nucleus are the most frequent but not sole site. Increased cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid levels and successful management of hemiballistic symptoms with neuroleptics have suggested a dopaminergic overactivity as the neurochemical pathology. Diazepam, a gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) mimetic drug, has recently been reported to possess therapeutic efficacy. Hemiballism is a treatable condition which responds to neuroleptics and possibly GABA mimetic drugs.", 
    "37": "A randomized study of the induction agents Midazolam and Hypnomidate on 20 patients without cardiovascular disease only showed a minimal effect of both agents on blood pressure, heart rate and myocardial function. Inspite of small differences after injection of Midazolam or Hypnomidate, neither of the agents appears superior to the other. Midazolam is an i.v. induction agent with minimal cardiovascular effect and good hypnotic properties.", 
    "38": "In the rat anococcygeus muscle, diazepam (1.8 X 10(-6) - 2.8 X 10(-5) M), dipyridamole (2 X 10(-6) - 3.2 X 10(-5) M) and ATP (2 X 10(-4) - 6.4 X 10(-3) M) concentration-dependently inhibited the motor response to field stimulation. Glycine (up to 7.5 X 10(-3) M) and GABA (up to 10(-4) M) had no effect on field stimulation. Concentrations of diazepam and dipyridamole which reduced motor response to field stimulation did not relax the tonically contracted rat anococcygeus muscle. However, at these concentrations, diazepam and dipyridamole potentiated the inhibitory responses of the tonically contracted rat anococcygeus muscle to ATP and field stimulation. It is suggested that diazepam and dipyridamole reduced the motor response to field stimulation by potentiating the inhibitory transmitter released during nerve stimulation. Also, since the time-course of the effect of diazepam and dipyridamole on the inhibitory responses to ATP and field stimulation are closely similar, the results would tend to provide additional support for the concept of purinergic transmission in the rat anococcygeus muscle.", 
    "39": "The reaction of 4-(dialkylamino)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-ones (I a-c) with N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of phosphorus pentachloride at room temperature gave rise to the formation of 4-(dialkylamino)-3-[(dimethylamino)methylene]-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzodiazepin- 2-ones (IX a-c) which were useful starting materials to achieve the synthesis of tricyclic 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives. Actually (IX a), selected for the smallest steric hindrance of the 4-dialkylamino substituent, by reaction with hydrazines afforded pyrazolo[3,4-b][1,5]benzodiazepine derivatives whereas reaction with guanidine or amidines gave 5H-pyrimido-[4,5-b][1,5]benzodiazepine derivatives. The structure of isomeric N-methyl-pyrazoles (X c) and (XI a) and of N-phenylpyrazole (X b) were elucidated by comparison with compounds prepared by unequivocal chemical methods. Pharmacological evaluation of some of the products showed only generic CNS depressant activity.", 
    "40": "High affinity binding of 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZP) to crude membrane preparations of bovine pineal membranes was examined by a rapid filtration procedure through Whatman GFB paper. At 0 degrees C binding reached equilibrium in about 20 min. Scatchard analysis of data at equilibrium revealed a single population of binding sites with dissociation constant (Kd) = 3.14 +/- 0.45 nM and binding site concentration (Bmax) = 55.6 +/- 5.6 fmol/mg protein. Kinetic analysis of the association and dissociation curves indicated a kinetic Kd = 1.13 nM, in reasonable agreement to that obtained at equilibrium. When various benzodiazepine (BZP) analogues were tested for their ability to inhibit 3H-FNZP binding, the following Ki (nM) were obtained: clonazepam (0.22), Ro 15-1788 (0.48), FNZP (0.95), Ro 5-4864 (greater than 10,000). When the beta-carboline derivative 3H-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ester (E beta CEE) was used as a radioligand, Kd at equilibrium (0.98 nM), kinetic Kd (1.69 nM) and affinity order for analogues were in close agreement to those found for FNZP binding; however, Bmax was about 60% that observed for 3H-FNZP binding. Addition of GABA or pentobarbital (100 microM) to pineal membranes increased 3H-FNZP binding by 55 and 72%. These results suggest the existence of a mixed population of type 1 and type 2 central BZP receptor subclass in bovine pineal gland.", 
    "41": "The pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines and psychostimulants are reviewed and an overview of the kinetic principles relevant to the utilization of these drugs in infancy and childhood is provided. Newborns and premature infants can metabolize and eliminate diazepam, although the parent drug has a longer half-life and decreased rate of biotransformation to its primary metabolites than in older children and adults. The newborn's capacity to carry on metabolic processes involved in the biotransformation of diazepam, including hydroxylation, demethylation, and glucuronide conjugation, is also limited before 5 months of age; after this time hepatic enzymes develop to adult capacity. Kinetic studies of psychostimulants in childhood indicate that methylphenidate is metabolized in the child as it is in the adult. The drug appears to be rapidly metabolized to ritalinic acid and the half-life seems to be relatively short. Volumes of distribution appear to be relatively large, suggesting extensive distribution of the drug to body tissues. Neither diazepam nor methylphenidate is without the potential for toxicity, which increases with dosage. The authors conclude that advancements in the technical capacity for obtaining and analyzing microsamples of blood as well as the use of noninvasive urinary studies will make future research in children possible.", 
    "42": "It has been found in experiments on rats with chronically implanted electrodes that water-deprived rats as well as those under the conflict-punishment conditions demonstrated considerable activation of the hippocampal theta-rhythm. Phenazepam decreased the hippocampal theta-rhythm in water-deprived rats, whereas electric punishment did not produce any appreciable changes in the frequency spectrum on the electrogram. The data obtained suggest that an anticonflict (anxiolytic) effect of benzodiazepines is caused by the regulatory influence on the theta-rhythm in the hippocamp.", 
    "43": "The water soluble benzodiazepine midazolam was compared with diazepam, in doses of 0.07 mg kg-1 and 0.15 mg kg-1 respectively, administered i.v. to 100 patients undergoing gastroscopy. The degree of sedation, ease of endoscopy and recovery were comparable in the two groups. The effects of both drugs on arterial pressure were similar. Compared with diazepam, midazolam had a faster onset of effect, caused virtually no pain on injection, and provided a greater degree of amnesia.", 
    "44": "The effects of lorazepam premedication on the mother and baby were compared with those of a placebo in a double-blind study of 10 patients undergoing elective Caesarean section. There was little anxiolytic effect on the mothers, and no harmful effects to the babies occurred in respect of blood-gas tensions, heart rate, temperature or feeding patterns. Lorazepam did produce a transient effect on the neonatal respiratory rate and initially the babies had a reduced score on the Brazelton Assessment System.", 
    "45": "The efficacy of a sublingual preparation of lorazepam was compared with an i.m. injection of lorazepam as premedication for 150 patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. Anxiety, arousability and recall of auditory, visual and tactile stimuli were used as measurements of the degree and rate of onset of the effects. Anxiety scores decreased in both groups after medication. Patients who received the drug sublingually showed less recall, an earlier onset of sedation, more drowsiness and a longer recovery time than those who received the drug i.m. It is concluded that lorazepam given by the sublingual route is superior to that given i.m. because of more rapid absorption resulting in earlier drowsiness and more amnesia. An additional advantage is the absence of the discomfort of an injection.", 
    "46": "The metabolic profile and human pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, a benzodiazepine of unique chemical structure, are discussed. Alprazolam's pharmacokinetics may be altered by age and sex, body weight, and concurrent treatment with cimetidine. The unique structure of alprazolam may be associated with a wider range of biologic activity than is seen with other benzodiazepines.", 
    "47": "Clinical and research findings are reviewed in relation to the distinction between endogenous and exogenous anxiety. The single most potent discriminating symptom between the two subtypes is the presence or absence of spontaneous (anxiety) symptom attacks. This concept avoids the diagnostic difficulties that can arise under current systems when patients present with symptoms that fulfill the criteria for multiple anxiety-related diagnosis. Patients in the endogenous category differ from those whose anxiety is reactive in age of onset, clinical course, and response to psychotherapy and medication. Thus, this distinction appears to have clinical merit.", 
    "48": "The medications currently used to treat generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and phobic disorders are reviewed, and research comparing their relative efficacies and use in conjunction with nonpharmacologic approaches is discussed. Although there is increasing public and professional interest in these disorders and their treatment, available research does not yet provide conclusive evidence that would permit more specific treatment recommendations, particularly in generalized anxiety disorder. A possible hierarchy of approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is presented and the need for further research in specific areas is identified.", 
    "49": "In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, the efficacy and safety of clobazam and diazepam were compared in 114 anxious outpatients. During the 4-week double-blind phase of the study, the mean daily dose was 59 mg for clobazam and 25 mg for diazepam. Results indicate statistically significant efficacy, measured by both patient and physician rating scales, for both active drugs compared to placebo. The incidence of sedation was similar for the two active treatment groups; dizziness was more frequent in the diazepam group.", 
    "50": "In the rat brain there are daily rhythms in the number of alpha- and beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, dopamine, opiate, and benzodiazepine receptors. The rhythms are circadian, i.e., with periods of approximately 24 h and endogenously generated. The characteristics of the circadian rhythms change over the year. Ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, believed to act as a biological clock, abolishes the circadian rhythms. In the cerebral cortex the circadian rhythm in norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP production is a biological response to the circadian rhythms in alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The effects on neurotransmitter receptor rhythms of treatments that are antidepressant in humans were studied. Chronic administration of the antidepressant drugs imipramine and clorgyline delays the timing of the peak number of many receptors. Chronic administration of the antidepressant, antimanic drug lithium carbonate delays the timing of the peak number of some receptors and abolishes the rhythms in several others. Twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation is almost without effect on the rhythms. Fluphenazine and lithium, both antimanic in humans, increase the 24-h mean number of most receptors. Circadian receptor rhythms evoking intracellular circadian biological responses may modulate brain neurotransmission, coordinating internal physiological processes, and synchronizing them to environmental events. Alterations in circadian receptor rhythms with chronic psychoactive drug administration may play a role in the therapeutic actions of these drugs.", 
    "51": "Triazolam was used to study the plasma concentration-effect relationship of a benzodiazepine because it has a very short plasma t1/2. A standard hypnotic dose of 0.25 mg was given by mouth to six healthy subjects, and blood samples were drawn when the subjects had to perform a battery of psychologic tests. Only the digit-symbol substitution test, the card-sorting test according to numbers, and the visual analog scale (energetic-lethargic) gave significant results. Analysis of the concentration-effect relationship in individuals indicated a wide scatter of the data. Mean values revealed a trend for a learning effect in the card-sorting test. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that triazolam is well suited for a study of concentration-effect relationships, but better psychologic tests would be desirable.", 
    "52": "One hundred twenty-three persons with a history of LSD use were studied for the presence of the LSD flashback phenomenon and compared with 40 control subjects. A syndrome emerged that included ten distance visual disturbances. It had lasted for five years in half of the population, was treatable with benzodiazepines, exacerbated by phenothiazines, and precipitated by 19 different stimuli, most commonly emergence into a dark environment. Sensitivity to LSD as determined by flashbacks appears to divide the study sample into three discrete subgroups. There may be a genetic basis to LSD sensitivity.", 
    "53": "The water-soluble inhibitory benzodiazepine, midazolam, was applied in low nanomolar concentrations to CA1 hippocampal neurons in vitro, recorded intracellularly. The drug caused a long-lasting hyperpolarization and moderate conductance increase, which persisted with TTX-induced synaptic blockade or with intracellular injection of Cl- ions, but not in zero Ca2+ perfusate. Calcium spikes elicited in the presence of TTX were enhanced by midazolam. It was concluded that these low nanomolar concentrations, which did not enhance GABA actions, inhibited by augmenting Ca2+ mediated K+-conductance.", 
    "54": "In experiments with audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice, we observed that several socalled benzodiazepine receptor antagonists exhibited either anticonvulsive (Ro 15-1788, PrCC) or proconvulsive (FG 7142, beta-CCE, CGS 8216) effects at high receptor occupancy (17-85%), as compared to benzodiazepines and DMCM which had anticonvulsive and proconvulsive actions, respectively, at very low receptor occupancy (less than 10%). Sensitive distinction between benzodiazepine receptor ligands with low anticonvulsive efficacy (partial agonists) and ligands with low proconvulsive, and maybe anxiogenic, efficacy (partial inverse agonists) can thus be obtained in sound seizure susceptible mice.", 
    "55": "The possibility that Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist would reverse the anxiolytic effect of VPA (200 mg/kg) in the Geller-Seifter paradigm was tested, using male albino rats. VPA (200 mg/kg) induced disinhibition which was antagonized by a convulsant benzodiazepine, Ro 5-3663 (1 mg/kg), but not by imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro 15-1788 at doses of 10 mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg. However, Ro 15-1788 (30 mg/kg) did have a short lasting antagonistic effect on VPA when tested in a \"condensed\" form (see text) of the conflict test. The nature of the anticonflict potency of VPA is discussed.", 
    "56": "The specific benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro14-7437, in nanomolar concentrations, caused depolarization, increased spontaneous spiking, and conductance decrease when applied to CA1 cells in vitro. These effects were resistant to intracellularly injected Cl- ions or synaptic blockade by TTX, were prevented in Ca2+-free medium, and occurred with or without prior application of midazolam, an inhibitory benzodiazepine. Ca2+-mediated AHPs and Ca2+ spikes in TTX medium were diminished by the blocker, suggesting that Ro14-7437 acted by inhibiting Ca2+-mediated K+ conductance.", 
    "57": "Certain benzodiazepines (BZs) like lorazepam, diazepam or clonazepam induce myoclonus jerks in photosensitive and non-photosensitive baboons. Papio papio, which are not accompanied by EEG paroxysmal discharges (type B). The effect of the selective BZ antagonist R0 15-1788 was evaluated in this myoclonus. Ro 15-1788 completely blocked type B myoclonus without decreasing the level of vigilance in the two types of baboons, and reversed the antiepileptic action of the BZs in the photosensitive ones, permitting the reappearance of myoclonus following EEG paroxysmal discharges (type A). L-5-hydroxytryptophan and progabide also blocked type B myoclonus, but the blockade was only transiently effective and was always accompanied by slight drowsiness.", 
    "58": "The potency of several new benzodiazepines as inhibitors of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was investigated in membranes from rat cerebellum or hippocampus. It was found that quazepam and two of its metabolites have a higher affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellum than for those in hippocampus, indicating a preferential interaction of these compounds with BZ1-receptors. Other experiments indicated that these compounds have benzodiazepines agonistic properties similar to diazepam or flunitrazepam. Thus for the first time, benzodiazepines have been identified with differentially interact with different benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "59": "LM cells have a saturable, high affinity binding site for [3H]flunitrazepam with a KD of 13 nM and a Bmax of 19 pmoles/mg protein. The IC50 values for Ro 5-4864, flunitrazepam and clonazepam against [3H]flunitrazepam were 6, 23 and 2800 nM, respectively, indicating that this receptor is of the peripheral type. A decrease of 37, 26 and 26% in Bmax was associated with substituting dimethylethanolamine, monomethylethanolamine or ethanolamine, respectively, for choline in the cell culture medium. These treatments did not change either the KD of [3H]flunitrazepam binding or the IC50 values of the different benzodiazepine drugs. Metastatic cell lines of the LM cell obtained from either athymic or C3H/Hef mice exhibited alterations in the binding parameters of [3H]flunitrazepam. There was a reduction in the Bmax values of the athymic (34%) and the C3H/Hef (44%) cell lines compared to the LM cell. In both groups there was a 90% increase in the KD. In the C6 astrocytoma, the peripheral type receptor appears to regulate plasma membrane mediated synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine. However, this was not observed in the LM cell. Nor did it modulate cyclic AMP metabolism as assessed by measurement of cyclic AMP levels in whole cells after drug treatment.", 
    "60": "This experiment tested whether benzodiazepine withdrawal could be detected in an animal model of anxiety. Rats were trained in operant chambers using food reward to press one lever after pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), 20 mg/kg, injection and the other lever after saline injection. Previously, the PTZ cue has been shown to be simulated by anxiogenic drugs and blocked by anxiolytic drugs. After rats reliably performed this discrimination, they were injected with diazepam, 20 mg/kg, from 1 to 4 times a day for six days. For one group of subjects, on the third, fourth and sixth days, they were also injected with 40 mg/kg of RO 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and tested for lever selection: 50-80% of the subjects selected the PTZ lever; these results are in contrast to those obtained prior to chronic diazepam treatment in which RO 15-1788 did not generalize to PTZ. A second group of subjects was also injected for six days with diazepam and then allowed to withdraw spontaneously for eight days: PTZ lever selection over this period varied from 20 to 60% of rats. These data indicate that animals trained to discriminate a PTZ cue: 1) generalize the benzodiazepine withdrawal state to the PTZ cue, and 2) discriminate the withdrawal state for long periods of time, agreeing with clinical observations of long-lasting anxiety signs during benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "61": "Forty-five elderly patients (mean age: 82 years), previously under benzodiazepines or neuroleptics, were given tiapride in a daily dosage of 100 to 400 mg for 2 to 4 months, usually by the oral route. The symptomatic effect of tiapride on agitation, excitability, unstability and sleep disturbances was excellent in 27 cases, satisfactory in 11, average in 5 and absent in 2. In 22 patients, tiapride produced significant improvement in morning wakefulness with increased diurnal activity and improved relationships and memory. The latency interval is variable, depending on the half-life of the benzodiazepine.", 
    "62": "Yohimbine (30 mg) produced significant increases in subjective anxiety, autonomic symptoms, blood pressure, and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) in ten healthy subjects. The effects of pretreatment with diazepam (10 mg) or clonidine (5 micrograms/kg) on these yohimbine induced changes was examined. Both diazepam and clonidine significantly antagonized yohimbine-induced anxiety, but only clonidine significantly attenuated the yohimbine induced increases in plasma MHPG, blood pressure, and autonomic symptoms. When given alone, clonidine significantly decreased plasma MHPG and blood pressure, whereas diazepam did not. These findings indicate that: (1) noradrenergic hyperactivity may be a factor in the production of some anxiety states; (2) the anti-anxiety effects of clonidine appear to result from its actions on receptors which decrease noradrenergic activity; (3) diazepam reverses yohimbine-induced anxiety without effects on several physiological or biochemical indicators of noradrenergic activity in humans.", 
    "63": "A benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, completely abolishes the sedative/ataxic effects of diazepam but, at the same dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.), it, like diazepam, slows the development of kindled seizures. This suggests that the anticonvulsant and sedative effects of benzodiazepines are mediated via different receptors and that Ro 15-1788 or similar compounds may be useful anticonvulsants.", 
    "64": "Densities of two benzodiazepine receptor subtypes (BDZ1 and BDZ2) in the frontal cortex of 10- and 27-month-old male Fischer-344 rats were nearly identical. Acute diazepam pretreatment produced a 73% increase in receptor density in the aged rats, mainly in the BDZ2 sites, whereas with the normal adult rat the density increased 42%, primarily due to stimulation of BDZ1 sites. Chronic exposure elicited similar increases of 28-29% in both normal and aged rats but there were subtle differences in the distribution of specific receptors. This study demonstrates a definite effect of age on the response of benzodiazepine receptors to diazepam pretreatment.", 
    "65": "All children aged under 15 years admitted to hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1974 and 1981 with a diagnosis of poisoning were studied. After the introduction in 1976 of child resistant containers for salicylates and paracetamol, salicylate poisonings fell dramatically. The other most important medicines to cause poisoning in young children were tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazapines, Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropine), and iron preparations; these should also be packaged in child resistant containers by regulation. Few children had symptoms after poisoning with household products, but bleach, turpentine, and paraffin might also be packaged in child resistant containers. The numbers of adolescent girls admitted after deliberate self poisoning and of teenage boys admitted after ingestion of alcohol increased over the study period.", 
    "66": "A reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatographic method for the determination of oxazepam in tablets and capsules was collaboratively studied by 9 laboratories. Collaborators were supplied with 6 samples that included synthetic and commercial formulations. Tablet and capsule composites are diluted with methanol and filtered. Oxazepam is determined at 254 nm by using a C18 column. Mean recoveries of oxazepam from synthetic tablet and capsule formulations were 97.2 and 99.0%, respectively. Mean coefficients of variation for tablets and capsules ranged from 1.85 to 2.86%. The method has been adopted official first action.", 
    "67": "The incidence of transient bacteremia following endoscopic injection sclerotherapy of esophageal varices was evaluated in 18 patients subjected to 40 sessions of injection sclerotherapy. Blood cultures were obtained before sclerotherapy and at five minutes, 30 minutes, and 24 hours after sclerotherapy. The injectors as well as the endoscope were cultured before and after the procedure. Blood cultures were positive in two patients after injection sclerotherapy (Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus species, coagulase-negative, respectively) for an incidence of 5% of transient bacteremia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent bacteria isolated from the injector after sclerotherapy. We conclude that the incidence of transient bacteremia after sclerotherapy is no higher than routine upper-intestinal endoscopy.", 
    "68": "The cardiovascular response evoked by tracheal intubation was observed in 20 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery in whom anaesthesia was induced with either midazolam 0.3 mg/kg or thiopentone 4.5 mg/kg followed by pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg. In the thiopentone group, intubation caused a mean rise in systolic arterial pressure from 141 to 193 mmHg (p less than 0.0005) and in the heart rate-systolic pressure product from 11101 to 21763 (p less than 0.05); 5 minutes later the mean values were still 173 mmHg and 19030 respectively. In the midazolam group systolic arterial pressure and the rate pressure product increased from 138 to 151 mmHg and 10960 to 14267 respectively in response to intubation. These values were significantly lower than the thiopentone group (p less than 0.005 in each case) and were relatively transient and returned to control values within 5 minutes.", 
    "69": "A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient acceptance of low-dose ketamine when used to diminish the pain of local anesthetic injections. The role of diazepam in preventing the untoward psychological effects of ketamine was also investigated. Our findings, derived from a postoperative questionnaire, reinforce the assertions of others, that ketamine is safe and effectively prevents pain in 85 percent of patients. While 13 percent of our patients hallucinated, most found the experience pleasant, and there were no \"bad trips\" or emergence reactions. Adequate premedication appears to be important in the successful use of ketamine. Whether sedation is augmented with diazepam or achieved with other medications does not appear to matter. A close supportive relationship with the surgeon and operating room personnel is probably as important as any pharmacologic manipulation in avoiding psychological mishap with low-dose ketamine.", 
    "70": "Single administration of FM-100 (50, 200 mg/kg, i.p.), cimetidine (200, 800 mg/kg, i.d.), pirenzepine (5, 20 mg/kg, i.d.) and ASS (20, 80 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently prevented ulcer formation in pylorus-ligated rats. FM-100 and pirenzepine dose-dependently decreased the volume of gastric juice with a slight increase in the pH, but scarcely influenced pepsin activity. The inhibitory effect of cimetidine on gastric secretion was characterized by an elevation in the pH of the gastric juice. ASS at 80 mg/kg, showing antiulcerogenic activity, had a weak antacidic effect on gastric juice without affecting the volume and pepsin activity. By the combination of FM-100 (50 mg/kg, i.p.) with cimetidine (200 mg/kg, i.d.), pirenzepine (5 mg/kg, i.d.) or ASS (20 mg/kg, p.o.), the preventive effects of these drugs on ulcer formation was augmented; and the combined administration of FM-100 with cimetidine or pirenzepine also enhanced the inhibitory effects of these drugs on gastric secretion.", 
    "71": "Delivery of a fixed-time, response-independent electric tail shock to the squirrel monkey generated bites on a rubber hose immediately following shock and manual responses on a lever immediately preceding shock; two temporally and topographically different responses in a single organism in a single experimental session. d-Amphetamine, cocaine, and caffeine each had the effect of elevating both bite and lever press responses; nicotine, chlorpromazine, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam each elevated lever press responding while depressing bite responding across a portion of the dosage range; phenobarbital, alcohol, and morphine had the effect of depressing both bite and lever press responses but lever pressing was selectively more depressed than biting. The results parallel previous research with these drugs on other measures of aggression and on other behavioral paradigms. The responses are contingency free so that the effect of a drug does not interact with response produced environmental consequences. The recording of two separate responses related to distinct emotional states from one organism in a single experimental session allows for the objective measurement of selective and differential drug effects.", 
    "72": "To initiate studies of benzodiazepine tolerance and physical dependence, a reproducible animal model has been developed utilizing chlordiazepoxide in rats. Based on the \"chronically equivalent\" dosing principle, a regimen has been devised to maintain rats in a state of quantifiable intoxication for 5 weeks. Chlordiazepoxide was delivered intragastrically on a b.i.d. basis in doses individually adjusted day-to-day and animal-to-animal to produce an equivalent impairment of motor function evaluated by a gross neurological screen. Quantitative analysis of central nervous system depression ratings during the time of peak effect (4 hr postdose) confirmed that the criterion of chronic equivalence was indeed met. Over the 5-week period of repeated dosing, tolerance was reflected in a 5-fold increase in maintenance dose, from 163.3 mg/kg on day 2 to 839.3 mg/kg on day 35. Tolerance developed more rapidly during the first 9 to 10 days, but continued to develop thereafter more slowly without apparent ceiling. Upon abrupt withdrawal, a syndrome of hyperexcitation developed. Signs included twitches, tremors, muscle hypertonus, arched back, piloerection, myoclonic jerks, augmented struggle and vocalization upon handling, increased startle response, tail erection, teeth chatter, blanched ears and weight loss. No spontaneous convulsions occurred. Latency to onset of withdrawal ranged from 2 to 5 days, and signs peaked in intensity in 8 days and disappeared by 14 days posttreatment. This animal model appears to provide a useful tool for the study of specific mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine tolerance and physical dependence."
