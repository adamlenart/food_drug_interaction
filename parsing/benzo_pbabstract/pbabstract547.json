    "0": "P388D1, a murine cell with macrophage properties, responds to exogenous arachidonic acid with superoxide anion production. This oxidative burst is enhanced by peripheral and mixed type benzodiazepines and this stimulation is specifically reversed by the peripheral antagonist PK 11195. In contrast, PK 11195 is unable to antagonize a stimulation caused by a non-benzodiazepine ligand such as the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe. The optimal concentrations were close to 10 nM and corresponded to the affinities of the compounds for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor detected on these cells. Compared to other tissues where peripheral benzodiazepines acted only at micromolar concentrations, the macrophage with its functional receptor appears as a privileged site of action for these molecules.", 
    "1": "Cerebral cortical cell cultures obtained from fetal mice were exposed to 200 nM clonazepam (CZP) for 14 days and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding was measured on intact cells in situ at 37 degrees C. Total, specific, and CZP-displaceable BDZ binding were significantly reduced from control values immediately after drug removal (77.7 +/- 1.4%, 75.1 +/- 3.0%, and 40.9 +/- 6.0% of control, respectively) but Ro5-4864-displaceable binding was not affected (87.6 +/- 5.1%). Binding returned to control values within 48 hours. Saturation analysis of the binding data indicated that a high-affinity binding site could not be detected in CZP-exposed cultures immediately after drug removal (162 nM versus 49 nM in controls, p less than .001), but was present 24 hours later.", 
    "2": "At the present time, the following summary statements can be made as to 24-hour changes in receptor binding. In all receptors studied in homogenates from whole rat forebrain (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, dopaminergic, 5HT-1, 5HT-2, adenosine, opiate, benzodiazepine, GABA, imipramine), significant variations over 24 hours have been documented. The receptor rhythms measured change in wave form, amplitude, and phase throughout the year, even though the animals have been kept on a defined and constant LD cycle. Whether these rhythms are truly seasonal requires further investigation. The rhythms are circadian: i.e. they persist in the absence of time cues, and the unimodal rhythms do not persist after lesion of the putative circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The rhythms can be uni- or bimodal, and each brain region shows a particular pattern. The pattern can be different for the same ligand in different nuclei of a given brain region (e.g. hypothalamus). Nearly all studies of receptor rhythms have been carried out in rats; the results vary according to strain and even within the same strain from different breeding lines. Receptor rhythm characteristics are modified by age: e.g. the amplitude, phase, as well as the 24-hour mean of binding to a given ligand in a defined brain region. The changes in number of binding sites over 24 hours can be correlated with amine turnover, second messenger, or function of that brain region; however these relationships, although consistent within a region, do not hold for all regions. If gradual changes in CNS neurotransmitter receptor function are considered important in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and affective disorders and the mode of action of psychopharmacological agents, then consideration of the short term rapid change over 24 hours is equally necessary. Chronic treatment with a number of psychoactive drugs known to induce up- or down-regulation of receptor number, also induces marked changes in circadian rhythm parameters of wave form, amplitude, phase and 24-hour mean. This is of methodological importance for single time-point studies, since the interpretation of the results will depend on time of day. Preliminary evidence supports the assumption that the significant variation in receptor binding throughout the day may underlie the well-known circadian rhythms of susceptibility to many CNS drugs. New findings of circadian rhythms in receptors on blood cells indicate the relevance of these changes also in human physiology.", 
    "3": "3H-Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, was injected IV into male and pregnant mice. Autoradiograms were prepared from sagittal sections of animals killed after 30 s to 48 h. In the adult animal there was a rapid and high initial accumulation of radioactivity in the brain as compared to other organs and tissues. The highest accumulation was found in cortical brain areas, such as the olfactory bulb and the frontal cortex. Cerebellar cortex, globus pallidus, amygdala, substantia nigra, colliculus, hippocampus and pons followed in rank order. The rate of decline of radioactivity was highest in the pons and lowest in the olfactory bulb. The initial disappearance of radioactivity from the cerebellum was higher than from the other brain regions. Ro 15-1788 was rapidly eliminated; 4 h after drug administration there was an almost complete clearance of radioactivity from all tissues. After 24 h no trace of activity remained in the animal. The distribution of radioactivity at later time points indicates that metabolites of Ro 15-1788 are eliminated by fecal, urinary and nasal secretion. In the fetus also there was an early accumulation of radioactivity in the central nervous system. The radioactivity in fetal organs was lower than in the mother at all time intervals.", 
    "4": "The question whether the benzodiazepine receptor site in astrocytes or in neurons might be identical to the adenosine uptake site was studied by determining pharmacological profiles, inhibition types, and the effects of benzodiazepine antagonists in primary cultures of either astrocytes or neurons. Fourteen different benzodiazepines and five different adenosine uptake inhibitors displaced [3H] diazepam and inhibited adenosine uptake in both astrocytes and neurons. However, the rank orders (determined as IC50 values) with which these two parameters were affected were profoundly different, indicating dissimilarities between these two sites. For several of the compounds a difference in inhibition type (competitive vs. noncompetitive) was observed between the benzodiazepine-binding site and the adenosine uptake site in astrocytes and/or neurons, which further corroborated the conclusion of a difference between the benzodiazepine-binding site and the adenosine uptake site. Finally, the neuronal benzodiazepine antagonists RO 15-1788 and CGS-8216 and the astrocytic benzodiazepine antagonist PK 11195, which reverse the action of benzodiazepines, were not able to reverse inhibition of adenosine uptake by diazepam but exerted an inhibitory effect of their own.", 
    "5": "2,3-Benzodiazepines (BZs), such as tofizopam (TP) and GYKI-51 189 have anxiolytic potency accompanied by moderate sedative action, but no anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant activities. These compounds show relatively low affinity to the peripheral benzodiazepine (PBZ) receptors, nevertheless, they decrease the binding of (3H)Ro5-4864 to its receptors in heart, kidney and brain membranes. This diminution in the binding is due to a decrease in the affinity for the ligand (Kd) without any change in the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax). This interaction of 2,3-BZs with PBZ binding sites may explain their pharmacological profile.", 
    "6": "The benzodiazepine/GABA receptor coupled chloride ionophore was examined in brain membranes of rats maintained in either a conventional animal facility or a \"protected\" (low-stress) environment. Following a 10 min ambient temperature swim, animals maintained in both environments had qualitatively similar increases in the number (Bmax) of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding sites, the apparent affinity of this radioligand, and the efficacy and potency of Cl- to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Nonetheless, the Bmax of [35S]TBPS and efficacy of Cl- to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding were significantly lower in animals housed in the protected environment compared to those maintained in a conventional facility both before and after swim stress. Furthermore, in rats housed in a protected environment, sequential removal of animals from a common cage (cohort removal), produced a very rapid increase (less than or equal to 15 s) in Cl(-)-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding in cortical and hippocampal but not cerebellar membranes. Cohort removal also produced a sequential increase in the number of [35S]TBPS binding sites and apparent affinity of this radioligand in cerebral cortical membranes. The effects of cohort removal were not observed in animals subjected to ambient temperature swim or if animals were removed from different cages. Changes in the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor coupled chloride ionophore produced by cohort removal from a common cage preceded any statistically significant changes in circulating levels of alpha-MSH, beta-endorphin, ACTH or corticosterone. These findings suggest that the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex (supramolecular complex) is under both tonic and acute regulation by the environment, and may subserve a physiologically relevant function in the response to stressful or anxiety producing stimuli.", 
    "7": "Repeated injections or oral administration of antidepressants: imipramine, amitriptyline and desmethylimipramine (10 mg/kg twice daily for 21 days) did not alter significantly [3H]flunitrazepam binding to frozen-thawed preincubated membranes from the brains of mice or rats.", 
    "8": "Neurotransmitter receptor binding was studied in the progeny of rats exposed to phenobarbital (80 mg/kg), phenytoin (80 mg/kg) or their combination daily from 5 to 20 days of gestation. At 22 days postnatally, female pups in all treated groups showed decreased binding of [3H]spiroperidol to striatal membranes. A decreased binding of [3H]diazepam to frontal cortical membranes was observed in the female pups of rats exposed to phenytoin or the combination. The Scatchard analysis of data from the affected groups revealed a decrease in the maximum number of dopamine and benzodiazepine receptor sites and no change in their affinities. The binding of [3H]spiroperidol or [3H]diazepam was not altered significantly in any of the drug-treated male pups. Also, no significant change in the binding of [3H]serotonin or [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to frontal cortical membranes was observed in any of the treated groups. At 60 days postnatally, no significant change in the binding of any of the above ligands was evident. The above prenatal drug exposures appear to cause transitory subsensitivity of dopamine and benzodiazepine receptors in rats.", 
    "9": "It has recently been demonstrated that kindling occurs with repeated administration of the benzodiazepine \"inverse agonist\" FG 7142. The present study was an investigation of the effects of other ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor in mice kindled with FG 7142. It was shown that over a range of doses the lowering effects of FG 7142 on the seizure threshold were greater in kindled animals than in control. In contrast, the hypothermic effect of FG 7142 was unaltered. The effects of the partial inverse agonist CGS 8216 were unaltered. The effects of the full inverse agonist DMCM were unchanged except for an enhancement of its convulsant effect when infused at a concentration of 100 mu gm 1-1. Studies with the full agonist benzodiazepine, flurazepam and the full agonist beta-carboline, ZK 93423, showed small but significant reductions in their hypothermic effects. The sedative and anticonvulsant effects of flurazepam were unaltered, whereas the anticonvulsant effects of ZK 93423 were decreased in animals kindled with FG 7142. There was a pronounced reduction in the anticonvulsant and hypothermic effects of the partial agonist beta-carboline, ZK 91296. These data do not fit any simple explanation of kindling being due to a change in the function of benzodiazepine receptors, although they may offer some support for the idea that kindling with FG 7142 produces a change in the effects of all beta-carboline compounds which act at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "10": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, erstwhile characterized in the rodent and feline brain, has now been characterized in post-mortem human brain using [3H]PK 11195. The kinetics and pharmacological properties of the binding of this ligand are similar to peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites elsewhere. The potency of RO5-4864 for this site in human brain is close to that seen in ruminant and carnivore tissues but considerably lower than in rodent tissues. The regional distribution of these binding sites would suggest a neuronal rather than a glial localization. [3H]PK 11195 bound in a similar fashion to slide-mounted sections of human brain, thus allowing quantitative studies of the regional distribution of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites to be made. The binding sites were distributed heterogeneously, but were restricted to the grey matter. Highest densities of binding sites were found in forebrain structures. The localization was not limited to any functional system, nor did it resemble any previously described transmitter system. The similarities between peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in human and in feline brain in terms of their pharmacological characteristics and their regional and subcellular distribution suggest that the cat, rather than the rat, may be the better model for studying a possible role for this site in human cerebral function.", 
    "11": "\"Peripheral\" benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) were studied in both the CNS and peripheral tissues of Maudsley reactive (MR) and Maudsley non-reactive (MNR) rats using the PBS specific ligand [3H]Ro 5-4864. A statistically significant reduction in the density of PBS was found in heart and kidney of the MR compared to the MNR. Similar reductions in the density of PBS were not observed in a number of areas of the central nervous system (including cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) or other peripheral tissues, such as lung and adrenal. This selective decrease in PBS in a strain selectively bred for a high degree of \"fearfulness\" may be related to previous findings of a reduction in the density of PBS in the same tissues in rats subjected to uncontrollable shock. These observations suggest that PBS in heart and kidney may be altered in response to fear or anxiety.", 
    "12": "Proconflict and electrocorticographic effects of drugs acting on the benzodiazepine (BDZ)/GABA/chloride-ionophore receptor complex were studied in rats in an attempt to correlate their anxiogenic and epileptogenic activities. Evidence for proconflict activity was assessed by means of an operant conflict procedure based on the simultaneous reward and punishment of a conditioned task, while epileptogenic properties were assessed by monitoring the electrocorticogram (ECoG) of free-moving rats. Pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin, which act through a site on the chloride channel, and the benzodiazepine (BDZ) inverse agonist FG 7142 showed epileptogenic alterations in the ECoG at doses, respectively, 8, 2 and 3 times higher than those eliciting a significant proconflict effect. For the partial inverse agonist CGS 8216, a ratio of about 60 was found while the BDZ antagonist Ro 15-1788 showed neither epileptogenic nor proconflict activity, except at the highest tested dose for the latter effect (40 mg X kg-1 PO). Inhibition of GABA transmission may mediate both anxiogenic and epileptogenic actions, and a link between these properties may exist as a continuous spectrum of negative intrinsic efficacy at the central BDZ/GABA/chloride-ionophore receptor complex.", 
    "13": "To investigate further the structural requirements for benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor ligands, we synthesized SR 95195, [7-phenyl-3-methyl-1,2,4-triazolo-(4,3-b) pyridazine], a positional isomer of the 6-phenyl-triazolo-pyridazines, which were the first non-BZD derivatives to exhibit high affinity for the BZD receptor and BZD-like activity in vivo. In vitro, SR 95195 displaced specifically bound [3H]-flunitrazepam from rat cerebellar and hippocampal membranes with respective IC50 values of 4 and 8 microM. In vivo, SR 95195 lacked BZD-like activity. At high doses SR 95195 induced clonic seizures in mice (threshold convulsant dose: 150 mg kg-1; CD50: 160 mg kg-1 i.p.) which were antagonized by Ro 15-1788. At non-convulsant doses (25 mg kg-1 i.p. and 100 mg kg-1 i.p.) SR 95195 significantly decreased punished responding in an operant conflict procedure in the rat, suggesting SR 95195 has intrinsic anxiogenic activity. SR 95195, in mice, reversed the anticonvulsant and myorelaxant actions of diazepam 3 mg kg-1, orally (respective ED50 values: 45 mg kg-1 i.p. and 44 mg kg-1 i.p.). In an operant-conflict test in rats, SR 95195 at non-anxiogenic doses, antagonized the disinhibitory action of diazepam 4 mg kg-1, i.p. (ED50: 8.6 mg kg-1, i.p.), but not that of pentobarbitone 15 mg kg-1, i.p. It is concluded that SR 95195 has the pharmacological profile of an inverse BZD agonist and that displacing the phenyl from the 6- to the 7-position in the triazolopyridazine series causes a shift from agonist to inverse agonist type activity at the BZD receptor site.", 
    "14": "The X-ray crystal structure of 3-(methoxycarbonyl) amino-beta-carboline, a selective antagonist of the sedative effects of diazepam having a high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor, has been determined. The results were compared with structural information obtained from this compound, both in the solid state and in dilute solution, by use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Its X-ray structure was also compared with those of two other active beta-carbolines, methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and N-ethyl-3-carbamoyl-beta-carboline. The crystal packing characteristics of 3-(methoxycarbonyl) amino-beta-carboline differ from those of these two beta-carbolines in both the pattern of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the quality of their pi-pi stacking interactions. The relevance this may have to the selective activity of 3-(methoxycarbonyl) amino-beta-carboline is discussed.", 
    "15": "The use of a novel photoaffinity label for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine-binding site is described. This compound, PK 14105, has high affinity (4 nM) and selectivity for cardiac benzodiazepine-binding sites. Under ultraviolet light, PK 14105 couples covalently to an 18,000-Da membrane protein which apparently corresponds to the (or a part of the) cardiac benzodiazepine-binding site. Since covalent attachment of PK 14105 totally precludes the binding of other ligands to this binding site, it is suggested that, during ultraviolet irradiation, this compound inserts covalently into the binding domain of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine-binding site.", 
    "16": "GABA-modulin (GM), a basic polypeptide purified from rat brain synaptosomes, which is an allosteric inhibitor of GABA recognition sites, has been detected in primary cultures of cerebellar interneurons enriched in granule cells by immunohistochemistry, using a specific antibody raised in rabbit injected with GM purified from rat brain synaptosomes. In these cultures, GM is expressed by the granule cells, which are postsynaptic to GABAergic interneurons, but not by glial cells. In rat cerebellar sections anti-GM antiserum intensely strains the granular cell layer and Purkinje cell dendrites and cell bodies. GM has been purified from the cerebellar granule cell cultures and appears to be identical under biochemical, immunological, and functional criteria to authentic GM purified from rat brain synaptosomes. Granule cell cultures devoid of GABAergic neurons contain the GABA/BZ/Cl- receptor complex; in fact, intact cell monolayers, incubated in physiological buffer at 25 degrees C, express 3H-muscimol and 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites, which are comparable to the sites detected in cell membrane preparations and which modulate each other reciprocally. It is concluded that GM might participate in the supramolecular organization of the GABA receptor complex, perhaps functioning as a modulator of this receptor protein.", 
    "17": "The influence of sodium chloride and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on H3-diazepam binding in CNS membrane fraction were investigated in C57Bl/6, BALB/c mice and their F1 hybrids. The addition of GABA (1, 10 and 100 microM) elevated the level of radioligand binding with CNS membranes in all the inbred mice in similar manner. The higher stimulating effect of sodium chloride (50, 100 and 150 mM) on the H3-diazepam reception was found in BALB/c mice and F1 hybrids, as compared to C57Bl/6 mice. It has been suggested that membrane-dependent conformational reconstructions of supramolecular receptor complex are the cause of genetic differences in the regulation of H3-diazepam reception by Cl(-)-ionophore.", 
    "18": "Photolabeling of the benzodiazepine receptor, which to date has been done with benzodiazepine agonists such as flunitrazepam, can also be achieved with Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. [3H]Ro 15-4513 specifically and irreversibly labeled a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 51,000 (P51) in cerebellum and at least two proteins with apparent molecular weights of 51,000 (P51) and 55,000 (P55) in hippocampus. Photolabeling was inhibited by 10 microM diazepam but not by 10 microM Ro 5-4864. The BZ1 receptor-selective ligands CL 218872 and beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester preferentially inhibited irreversible binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 to protein P51. Not only these biochemical results but also the distribution and density of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites in rat brain sections were similar to the findings with [3H]flunitrazepam. Thus, the binding sites for agonists and inverse agonists appear to be located on the same proteins. In contrast, whereas [3H]flunitrazepam is known to label only 25% of the benzodiazepine binding sites in brain membranes, all binding sites are photolabeled by [3H]Ro 15-4513. Thus, all benzodiazepine receptor sites are associated with photolabeled proteins with apparent molecular weights of 51,000 and/or 55,000. In cerebellum, an additional protein (MW 57,000) unrelated to the benzodiazepine receptor was labeled by [3H]Ro 15-4513 but not by [3H]flunitrazepam. In brain sections, this component contributed to higher labeling by [3H]Ro 15-4513 in the granular than the molecular layer.", 
    "19": "In previous studies of experimental and human epilepsy, defects have been shown in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. We further investigated the role of the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxinin receptor complex in the epileptic focus and also in other regions of the rat brain. The focus was induced by cobalt implantation to the right motor cortex, and the brains were dissected 16-19 days after the operation. Benzodiazepine (using [3H]flunitrazepam as a ligand; FLU), GABA [3H]muscimol; MUS), and picrotoxinin [( 35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate; TBPS) receptor bindings were measured in different brain areas and the values were compared with glass-implanted controls. In the focal area, the specific receptor binding decreased in the order TBPS greater than FLU greater than MUS. In the perifocal area only TBPS binding decreased, and Scatchard analysis showed a decrease in the number of binding sites (p less than 0.05) without any effect on binding affinity. No change was seen in the binding characteristics of the other areas studied. According to our results, in cobalt-induced epilepsy the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxinin receptor complex is modulated in the focal area; this may lead to a defect in chloride conductance, which in turn induces disturbed control of neuronal activity in the epileptic focus.", 
    "20": "The binding of the benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) and the allosteric enhancement of FNZ binding by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were investigated in brain tissue from short-sleep (SS) and long-sleep (LS) mice, lines selectively bred for differential sensitivity to ethanol. GABA enhanced FNZ binding in a dose-dependent manner in both lines. This enhancement was greater in SS than in LS cortical and cerebellar regions, but did not differ between lines in midbrain or hindbrain regions. In whole brain, no difference was observed between the two lines in the number or affinity of benzodiazepine receptors, as determined by FNZ binding. These results suggest that the nature of allosteric interactions within the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex is different for LS and SS mice.", 
    "21": "In order to investigate possible teratogenic effects of commonly used benzodiazepines (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam) in Hungary, four approaches were used: 1. A retrospective case-control study of 630 cases with isolated cleft lip +/- cleft palate, 179 cases with isolated cleft palate, 392 cases of multiple congenital anomalies including cleft lip and/or cleft palate, and their matched control cases; 2. The Case-Control Surveillance System of Congenital Anomalies in Hungary, 1980 to 1984, involving 355 cases with isolated cleft palate, 417 cases with multiple congenital anomalies, and 186 cases with Down's syndrome (as positive controls). Benzodiazepines were taken by 14.9% of 11,073 control pregnant women studied; 3. A prospective study of 33 pregnant women attending the Counselling Clinic following ingestion of benzodiazepines during the first trimester of pregnancy; 4. An observational study involving 12 pregnant women who attempted suicide and one with accidental overdosage with benzodiazepines during pregnancy. None of these four approaches gave any indication of an association between facial clefting and in utero exposure to these substances.", 
    "22": "The circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in hamsters maintained in either constant darkness or constant light can be phase-shifted by a single injection of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam. These results suggest that treatment with triazolam may also alter the entrainment pattern of circadian rhythms in animals that are synchronized to a light-dark (LD) cycle. To test this hypothesis, hamsters maintained on an LD 6:18 light cycle received daily injections of triazolam (or vehicle) for 10-12 days, and any subsequent effects on the phase relationship between the onset of activity and the LD cycle were determined. Daily injections of triazolam (but not vehicle) induced pronounced advances or delays in the phase relationship between the entrained activity rhythm and the LD cycle; the direction of the shift was dependent on the time of the injection. Taken together with data from previous studies, these results suggest that triazolam, and perhaps other short-acting benzodiazepines, can be used to manipulate the mammalian circadian clock under a variety of experimental conditions.", 
    "23": "The prophylactic effect of an inhibitor of synaptosomal GABA uptake, SK&F 89976-A (N-[4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl]-nipecotic acid), on the development of amygdala kindled seizures was studied in adult female rats. For comparative purposes, the action of diazepam was also investigated. Dosages of SK&F 89976-A and diazepam which were previously shown to be the ED50 for seizure inhibition in fully kindled rats (15 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg i.p., respectively) were administered daily 30 min prior to amygdala stimulation in naive, unkindled rats. Both drugs inhibited the evolution of full kindled seizure activity and markedly suppressed kindling-associated increases in the duration of behavioral and electrographic seizures. Control rats developed fully kindled stage 5 seizures after 8.9 +/- 1.1 amygdala stimulations but drug-treated rats did not progress beyond an early stage of kindled seizures as long as the animals were treated with the drugs (22 days). Diazepam produced significant CNS depressant effects throughout the course of administration but SK&F 89976-A prevented kindling with no depressant side effects. The ability of SK&F 89976-A and diazepam to inhibit the development of full amygdala kindled seizures may be related to enhancement of central inhibitory GABAergic systems.", 
    "24": "Ataranalgesia (ATA) is realized by the association of a strong morphinomimetic, a benzodiazepine (BZD) and a curare. It is an anesthesia technique derived from neuroleptanalgesia, one of the most employed modern anesthesia techniques. In this formula, midazolam, a hydrosoluble BZD, with a rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than the other substances of this group (diazepam or flunitrazepam) was rapidly introduced. For the induction of an ATA, we mix in the same syringe the loading doses of the BZD, the opiate (fentanyl, alfentanil or sulfentanil) and the curare (pancuronium or atracurium) and we administer them simultaneously. The maintenance of anesthesia is performed by perfusion of the opioid with a constant flow, deliberately underdosed, in addition to microboli of the 3 chosen substances as needed to assure the stability of anesthesia. In this anesthesia mixture, midazolam ensures sedation, sleep, amnesia and reinforces and stabilizes the analgesic or myorelaxant action of the two other substances. To realize this technique with success, it is useful to remember the pharmacological interactions that are created between midazolam, the morphinomimetics and the curare. This report will focus on their description. The possibilities to use midazolam in anesthesia and the controllability of ATA have been enlarged since the synthesis of the antidote Ro 15-1788 (Anexate).", 
    "25": "Ultrasonically nebulized aqueous aerosols enable the study in man of vagal epithelial rapidly adapting receptors. Inhalation of aerosols with low chloride ion concentration causes cough. Bronchodilatation in normal subjects using either inhaled fenoterol or ipratropium inhibits this reflex induced cough. It suggests that pulmonary stretch receptors (slowly adapting receptors) may play a part in modulating the cough reflex in man as has been suggested in cats and rabbits.", 
    "26": "Series of experiments and clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of psychoneurotropic agents on sexual behaviour of stallions. The benzodiazepine derivative, diazepam (Valium), effectively reversed experimentally suppressed precopulatory arousal and response. Diazepam treatment also blocked the negative effect of novel environment on sexual response. The dibenzazepines imipramine and clomipramine induced erection, masturbation, and ejaculation in the absence of a sexual stimulus.", 
    "27": "Benzodiazepine-binding inhibitory (BBI) activity was detected in aqueous extracts of brain and peripheral tissues of rats. The BBI activity in brain and in adrenals was, at least partially, due to the presence of N-desmethyldiazepam and diazepam as shown by HPLC, UV-spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In addition, BBI activity was found in standardized rat food, as well as in a variety of cereals and in other nutritive plant products. In wheat grains diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam could be identified by HPLC and analysis by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. The estimated amounts of the two benzodiazepines present in rat brain and adrenals and in wheat grains were in the low ppb range. Since laboratory contamination was rigorously excluded we conclude that diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam are naturally occurring compounds. These findings may explain their occurrence in the brain and adrenals of animals.", 
    "28": "The hypothermia and motor behavioural syndrome produced in rats by injection of the 5-HT1A ligand 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) has been studied following administration of electroconvulsive shock under halothane anaesthesia (ECS) and during the administration of antidepressant drugs. Repeated ECS attenuated the hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg SC) immediately after the last of five shocks given spread out over 10 days with a maximal effect 21 days after the final shock. A single ECS was without effect. The serotonin syndrome produced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.75 mg/kg SC) was also attenuated, although simple motility was increased. Zimeldine (20 mg/kg) and desipramine (20 mg/kg), when given once daily for 14 days also attenuated the hypothermia and the serotonin syndrome provoked by 8-OH-DPAT. The hypothermic response was somewhat reduced 24 h after a single injection of zimeldine but not 45 min after zimeldine (5 mg/kg IP). At a high dose (20 mg/kg) tranylcypromine clearly attenuated both responses 24 h after a single injection. Tranylcypromine (6 mg/kg IP) showed a smaller effect after a single injection but attenuated the behavioural syndrome on repeated administration. Repeated injection of flurazepam (10 mg/kg IP) was without effect on either the behavioural or hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT. These findings are consistent with the view that responses mediated via the 5-HT1A receptor may be involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments.", 
    "29": "The GABAA receptor of mammalian neurons exists as a macromolecular complex incorporating several interacting components. These include a chloride-permeable ion channel and a recognition site for GABA. The binding of GABA molecules at the latter site triggers the transient opening of the chloride ion channel, resulting in a flow of charge which inhibits the generation of action potentials in the cell. The precise amount of charge passed during this event is modulated by ligand binding at at least three regulatory sites. These sites act as receptors for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and certain convulsants. The extracellular patch clamp method has now been used to study the gating of chloride channels by GABA and the modulation of this process by drugs. Even in the absence of drugs, GABAA channels exhibit complex gating behavior, indicating the presence of multiple open and closed states and of substate conductance levels. GABAA channels from different preparations show considerable diversity in their detailed gating characteristics. In the presence of the barbiturate pentobarbital, GABAA channels open in prolonged bursts, consistent with the potentiating effect of this drug on macroscopic GABA responses. In contrast, the convulsant penicillin decreases charge transfer through open GABAA channels by shortening the average duration of the open state. Benzodiazepine receptor ligands exert complex effects on the GABAA channel. A general model of barbiturate and benzodiazepine potentiation of GABAA receptor responses is proposed.", 
    "30": "In this double-blind study we compared alprazolam, clobazam, and placebo for the treatment of outpatients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. At the end of the treatment, the three groups were significantly improved without showing differences among them. However, both active-drug groups were much improved at the end of week 1 in contrast to the placebo group. We were unable to find any difference on efficacy evaluations between alprazolam and clobazam, but alprazolam reached a consistently better outcome on some ratings compared to placebo. Although benzodiazepines share many common properties, it is necessary to identify selected groups of patients that can be helped by specific compounds or even placebo.", 
    "31": "The dynamics of EEG slow wave activity during sleep were investigated in two subjects recorded for 14 consecutive nights, and in 14 subjects recorded for one night after placebo administration. In addition, records were obtained after a single bedtime dose of the benzodiazepine hypnotics flurazepam (30 mg), flunitrazepam (2 mg), triazolam (0.5 mg) and midazolam (15 mg). Mean slow wave activity (i.e. spectral power density in the 0.75-4.5 Hz band) invariably declined from the first to the third nonREM sleep episode. Within episodes, slow wave activity showed initially a gradual buildup over a period of offroximately 35 min, and in the end a rapid decline. Both the rise rates and fall rates decreased over the first three nonREM sleep episodes. The benzodiazepines typically attenuated mean slow wave activity within episodes as well as the rise and fall rates. For three compounds, residual effects were demonstrated in the drug-free post-drug night. We conclude that a homeostatically regulated sleep process determines the buildup rate of slow wave activity within nonREM sleep episodes.", 
    "32": "The experiments were carried out on Wistar rats, using a conflict situation consisting in opposition of two motivations: positive (water drinking) and negative (electrical pain). Two newly-synthesized piperazine derivatives with proved psychotropic activity (4P-183 and GP4) were studied and compared with the classical benzodiazepine tranquilizing agent diazepam. Parallel with this, the affinity of these compounds to the benzodiazepine receptor in mouse brain was tested (radioligand binding of 3H-diazepam), as well as the changes in the characteristics of binding (dissociation constant and density of the receptors) after 14-day administration o doses equal to 1/3 LD50 of the two compounds. The results indicate the existence of anxiolytic (anticonflict) activity in both compounds. The fact that the above-mentioned derivatives do not interact with 3H-diazepam (in vitro), changing above all the dissociation constant after chronic administration, suggests predominantly nonspecific type of binding to the receptors. It is possible that their anxiolytic activity is associated with indirect interactions with one of the components of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, similar to the atypical tranquillizers.", 
    "33": "The first discovered exogenous teratogen causing mental retardation was rubella embryopathy described in 1940. Later, cytomegalic virus infection and toxoplasmosis during pregnancy and ionogenic radiation has been shown to cause embryofetopathies with concomitant mental retardation. Methyl mercury in high doses cause severe central nervous system pathology in both mothers and their fetuses. The fetal alcohol syndrome is now generally accepted as causing mostly mild mental retardation. Of therapeutic drugs, antiepileptics have been shown to carry a risk for the fetal antiepileptic syndrome complex. We have recently been able to describe fetal pathology following high intake of benzodiazepines during pregnancy.", 
    "34": "An open clinical trial was conducted on an unlocked ward investigating the use of benzodiazepines as adjunctive therapy with neuroleptics in managing acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia. Seventeen patients meeting DSM-III criteria for this disorder were treated. Patient response was monitored with use of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Beigel Mania Rating Scale. Our results indicate that those patients who received greater than 2 mg lorazepam equivalents daily had greater improvement at 4 days of treatment in comparison to those who received less than 2 mg lorazepam equivalents daily.", 
    "35": "Electroencephalograms were recorded from the parietal and frontal cortex of freely moving rats held in constant vigilance by placing them in a slowly turning drum. The effects of 5 clinically effective anxiolytics, buspirone, meprobamate, phenobarbital, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, were studied after intraperitoneal injection of different doses. After on-line fast Fourier transformation of the EEG signal, the drug effects were quantified by an Analysis of Variance. This resulted in a t profile for each drug dosage. Averaging the t profiles of all dosages of a drug results in a 'drug profile'. Averaging the drug profiles of the 5 anxiolytic drugs tested results in an 'anxiolytic profile'. This profile is characterized by a power decrease from 8 to 11 Hz and above 70 Hz and a power increase from 20 to 60 Hz. The anxiolytic profile is compared with the formerly defined antidepressant and neuroleptic profiles and can be clearly distinguished from the latter two.", 
    "36": "Benzodiazepines are widely used and well-known for their safety; serious complications may, nevertheless, occur in the particular case of an abrupt withdrawal, which is quite common after general anaesthesia. The case reported emphasizes the seriousness of the syndrome : after vascular surgery the patient presented with repeated epileptic seizures and a short lasting cardiac arrest. The patient used to absorb large quantities of benzodiazepines, without medical prescription. The convulsions stopped after the benzodiazepine had been taken again. The exact mechanism of the withdrawal syndrome remains hypothetical. There are numerous risk factors which increase the probability and seriousness of the withdrawal symptoms. The prevention of withdrawal accidents depends on the physician, and especially the anesthetist, knowing the patient's drug intake. This shows yet again the importance of the preanaesthetic visit.", 
    "37": "The ability of chronic treatment with imipramine (an antidepressant with anti-panic activity) to antagonise the anxiogenic effects of 3 different compounds was investigated in the elevated plus-maze. The compounds chosen are likely to produce anxiety by activity at different sites in the central nervous system: yohimbine, by blocking the alpha 2-adrenoceptor; FG 7142, by action at the beta-carboline site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and pentylenetetrazole, by acting at the picrotoxinin site on this complex. Administration of imipramine following 21 days pre-treatment did not produce a significant consistent anxiolytic effect alone and was unable to reverse the anxiety produced by any of the 3 anxiogenic compounds. Our results are discussed in terms of the nature of the anxiety produced by the anxiogenic drugs and the sensitivity of tests of anxiety to anti-panic agents.", 
    "38": "The pharmacological properties of zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone derivative, have been studied in comparison with diazepam, nitrazepam, and flurazepam, on behavioral tests in mice and rats, including open-field activity, Skinner box conflict test, hyperemotionality and muricidal behavior of olfactory bulbectomized or raphectomized rats, pentetrazol or electroshock convulsions, inclined screen, rotarod, and thiopental-, ether-, or ethanol-induced anesthesia. Zopiclone exhibited pharmacological properties qualitatively similar to those of benzodiazepines especially in conflict, aggressivity, and pentetrazol-induced convulsion tests. On the other hand, its myorelaxant activity was somewhat weaker than that of the reference drugs. The pharmacological effects of zopiclone were of short duration.", 
    "39": "PAF-acether, a naturally occurring phospholipid, is a potent activator of various biological processes, including platelet aggregation. The mechanisms of action of PAF are largely unknown. We have found that the psychotropic triazolobenzodiazepine drugs, alprazolam and triazolam, potently (IC50 less than 1 microM) inhibit PAF-induced shape change, aggregation and secretion of human platelets. These effects are specific for PAF-activation, since the responses of human platelets to other agonists (ADP, thrombin, epinephrine, collagen, arachidonate and the Ca++ ionophore, A23187) are not inhibited by these triazolobenzodiazepines. The action of triazolobenzodiazepines on PAF-induced platelet function has clinical relevance, especially in diseases where enhanced platelet aggregability may lead to thrombosis and atherosclerosis. In addition, the ability of triazolobenzodiazepines to inhibit other PAF-mediated cellular-responses, such as anaphylactic shock or bronchoconstriction, suggests that these drugs may be useful in preventing several known pathophysiological effects of PAF. The specific antagonism of PAF action by psychotropic drugs also suggests that PAF or PAF-like phospholipids may play a role in neuronal function. This possibility was tested by examining the effects of PAF on neural cells of the clonal line NG108-15, grown in culture in a chemically defined, serum-free medium. Low concentrations of PAF (0.5-2.5 microM) induced neurite extension in NG108-15 cells, whereas higher concentrations (greater than 3 microM) were cytotoxic. Using NG108-15 cells preloaded with aequorin, it was found that PAF causes an increase in intracellular ionized calcium concentration, which is dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. These results suggest that PAF-induced Ca++ uptake may play a role in neuronal development, and that circulating PAF may contribute to the neuronal degeneration caused by the exposure of neural tissues to blood in situations such as spinal cord injury, trauma, or stroke.", 
    "40": "The article reports threshold ranges and detection limits for the screening of tetracyclic benzodiazepines (adinazolam, alprazolam, brotizolam, estazolam, loprazolam, midazolam, triazolam and many metabolites) using the EMIT-st and TDx system (FPIA). In most cases, the cross reactivities of the two systems are comparable, but there are also remarkable differences. Detection limits are mainly in the range between 0.2 and 0.5 mg/l but, in some cases, the limits are also considerably higher. The within-day precision is 1.1% (TDx) and 16.5% (EMIT-st); day-to-day precision is 4.7% (TDx) and 12.6% (EMIT-st), respectively.", 
    "41": "Using a two-lever operant choice task, rats were trained to discriminate diazepam (3.0 mg/kg) from saline under a fixed-ratio 10 (FR10) schedule of reinforcement. Once the discrimination was learned, generalization studies were conducted using various doses of 17 benzodiazepine derivatives. The diazepam stimulus generalized in a dose-related manner to each of these compounds. ED50 values were compared with available data on displacing affinities (Ki values) for tritiated diazepam brain binding in man, and with human therapeutic potency. A significant correlation (r = 0.88, n = 9) was found between benzodiazepine binding affinities and ED50 values derived from the diazepam stimulus generalization assay. A significant correlation (r = 0.92, n = 10) was also found between drug discrimination ED50 values and human therapeutic potencies. Finally, the benzodiazepine structure activity relationships generated from the drug discrimination studies closely paralleled the known structure activity relationships for these agents. The results provide further evidence that benzodiazepines exert their pharmacological effects through an interaction with benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "42": "A combined visual (pictures) and auditory (word lists) memory test developed to trace the course of information processing under pharmacological or other influences was validated in a group of 20 subjects (control group) and then applied to determine the amnesic effects of lormetazepam and the reversal of these effects by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Three groups of n = 10 subjects received either 0.02 mg/kg IV lormetazepam (groups B and C) or placebo (group A) followed 14 min later by 0.03 mg/kg IV Ro 15-1788 (groups A and C) or placebo (group B). The time course of memory performance in the three groups was investigated and compared across three consecutive 14-min phases: before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) the first intravenous administration, and after the second treatment (phase 3). Results were also compared with those of 20 subjects from a drug-free control group in order to verify the memory test. Lormetazepam clearly impaired immediate and delayed free recall as well as recognition in both visual and auditory tasks. These effects were completely reversed by Ro 15-1788, which alone had no clear effect on memory performance in this study. Psychometric scales indicated concomitant sedation and impaired concentration after lormetazepam alone. Interestingly, lormetazepam retrogradely enhanced performance in the visual test of delayed free recall. The impaired acquisition of new information after the administration of lormetazepam may be associated with an improvement of the consolidation process of information acquired before drug treatment.", 
    "43": "Rats were trained to discriminate injections of racemic pentobarbital (5.0 mg/kg) from saline in a two-lever drug discrimination task. After stable discrimination performance was attained, stimulus generalization studies were conducted with another barbiturate (barbital), benzodiazepine derivatives (diazepam and chlordiazepoxide), pyrazolopyridine derivatives (etazolate, cartazolate, and tracazolate), and a triazolopyridazine (CL 218, 872). The pentobarbital stimulus generalized to all of these compounds, except cartazolate. In addition, the administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazepil prior to benzodiazepine or triazolopyridazine administration produced a dose-related antagonism of each generalization. In contrast, the administration of flumazepil before barbiturate or pyrazolopyridine (i.e., etazolate or tracazolate) injection resulted in no attenuation of these generalizations. The results indicate that while certain barbiturates, benzodiazepines, pyrazolopyridines and triazolopyridazines are capable of producing similar stimulus effects, the behavioral actions of these agents can be differentiated on the basis of their susceptibility to antagonism by flumazepil.", 
    "44": "In order to investigate the behavioural effect of selective blockade of M1 muscarinic receptors in the forebrain, and to characterize a new model for the evaluation of muscarinic agonistic activity, the effect of intrastriatally injected pirenzepine was studied in mice. The direct injection of pirenzepine (0.01-1 microgram/mouse) into the right striatum of conscious mice resulted in contralateral turning behaviour. When injected intraperitoneally (IP) 15 min before pirenzepine (1 microgram), the muscarinic receptor agonists arecoline and pilocarpine (0.3-3 mg/kg), oxotremorine (0.003-0.03 mg/kg) and RS 86 (0.03-1 mg/kg) antagonized pirenzepine-induced turning, as did the choline-esterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) and the nootropic drug aniracetam (10-30 mg/kg). Haloperidol (0.03-0.3 mg/kg IP) weakly, but significantly, decreased the effect of pirenzepine, whereas (+/-) sulpiride (3-100 mg/kg) failed to affect it. Finally, (+/-)-amphetamine (0.1-3 mg/kg IP), citalopram (1-30 mg/kg IP) and muscimol (0.03-0.3 mg/kg IP) failed to modify pirenzepine-induced turning when administered prior to intrastriatal pirenzepine. These results suggest an involvement of M1 muscarinic receptors in rotational behaviour, and indicate that pirenzepine-induced turning may represent a new model for studying the central activity of cholinomimetic drugs.", 
    "45": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate either a fixed dose of PCP (1 mg/kg; n = 3) or a progressively decreasing dose (1-0.56-0.32 mg/kg; n = 4) from saline. Lowering of the training dose shifted the dose-effect curve for PCP's discriminative stimulus effects about 5-fold to the left, in a parallel manner, but did not decrease the accuracy of the discrimination performance and did not significantly increase the extent to which pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide produced PCP-appropriate responding. Dose-effect curves based on binary generalization data were evaluated statistically with new methods that may be more appropriate than those used previously. Metaphit, a proposed PCP-receptor acylator, and 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP5), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, produced complete PCP-appropriate responding in the high training dose group only at doses that suppressed the rate of responding and that produced ataxia. However, 4-fold lower doses of metaphit and AP5, which did not produce directly observable behavioral effects, were found to substitute completely for PCP in the low training dose group. These data support the notion that PCP, metaphit, and AP5 have a common discriminative effect in pigeons.", 
    "46": "Suriclone is a new anxiolytic drug belonging to the family of cyclopyrrolones. Although chemically entirely different from the benzodiazepines, it acts as a benzodiazepine agonist with very high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptors. In the present cross-over study, 33 out-patients with a diagnosis of neurotic anxiety were treated with suriclone (mean dose 2 mg/day) and diazepam (25 mg/day) in two 6-week periods. Both drugs had a significant anxiolytic effect, but diazepam appeared to have a better effect within the first 2 weeks of treatment, while no significant difference was seen after treatment, while no significant difference was seen after treatment for 6 weeks. Suriclone and diazepam had a different side effect profile: suriclone produced mainly dizziness, while diazepam caused sedation. This may reflect the fact that suriclone and benzodiazepines bind to distinct sites or different allosteric conformations of the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "47": "Five compounds that bind to the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor, but show different pharmacological characteristics from the classical BZs, are profiled. CGS 8216 is a BZ antagonist/inverse agonist that reverses the effects of diazepam and also acts as a proconvulsant. CGS 9895 is also a potent BZ antagonist. In addition, this compound shows an anxiolytic profile. CGS 9896, CGS 17867A and CGS 20625 are BZ agonists (i.e., anxiolytics and anticonvulsants) which produce varying magnitudes of antagonist effect. All of these compounds are unique from the classical BZs in that each has a reduced propensity to produce the sedative and/or muscle relaxant effects characteristically associated with BZs.", 
    "48": "H2-receptor antagonists are among the most widely-used drugs in the world and, since many patients receive a variety of other drugs concomitantly, it is important to investigate the interaction potential of new H2-receptor antagonists such as nizatidine. It is well documented that cimetidine can inhibit the hepatic elimination of many drugs by binding to the cytochrome P-450 system. Therefore we investigated in vitro and in vivo the effects of nizatidine on drug metabolism. With rat liver microsomes the effects of nizatidine and four other H2-blockers (cimetidine, oxmetidine, ranitidine, famotidine) on the activity of three marker enzymes (aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase, 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, 7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase) were tested. While cimetidine and oxmetidine exhibited marked and dose-dependent inhibition of all three metabolic reactions, nizatidine showed some weak inhibition only at very high concentrations. Similarly, binding to cytochrome P-450 of human liver microsomes could be seen only with cimetidine and oxmetidine, whereas nizatidine did not affect the binding spectra. In nine healthy mal volunteers the pharmacokinetics of diazepam (10 mg po) was studied under the influence of nizatidine (300 mg day nocte). Nizatidine had no significant effect on the hepatic elimination of diazepam, as characterized by its elimination half-life (mean +/- SD) of 35.3 +/- 24.2 h (control) and 37.3 +/- 18.3 h (+ nizatidine) or its total plasma clearance of 28.2 +/-12.0 ml/min (control) and 26.7 +/- 10.4 ml/min (+ nizatidine). The formation of the major metabolite-desmethyldiazepam-was also unaffected by nizatidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The rates of reported adverse drug reactions involving the central nervous system were compared among patients taking any of three benzodiazepine hypnotics: flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam. These rates, based upon data collected through the spontaneous reporting system of the Food and Drug Administration, were controlled for the number and size of new prescriptions for each drug. In general, triazolam had much higher overall rates than did the other two drugs. Hyperexcitability and withdrawal effects were greatest for triazolam and least for flurazepam. Amnesia was reported almost exclusively with triazolam. Rates for other cognitive as well as affective and other behavioral effects were also much greater for triazolam and about equal for the other two drugs. Finally, daytime sedation was reported slightly more for flurazepam than triazolam and least for temazepam which was also reported most frequently as lacking hypnotic effect.", 
    "50": "Benzodiazepine binding sites in mouse astrocytes and neurons in primary cultures were labeled with [3H]diazepam (1.8 nM), and their inhibition by 14 different benzodiazepines and 3 benzodiazepine antagonists was studied. RO 5-4864, RO 7-3351, and, especially, the antagonist PK 11195 were much more potent in astrocytes than in neurons, whereas the opposite was true for the agonists alprazolam, clonazepam, flurazepam, RO 11-3128, and chlordiazepoxide, and, especially, the antagonists CGS-8216 and RO 15-1788. Flunitrazepam, diazepam, midazolam, RO 11-6893, and RO 5-2181 were about equipotent in the two cell types. The neuronal, but not the astrocytic, binding site showed stereospecificity. In astrocytes most of the drugs had pseudo-Hill coefficients close to one, whereas the pseudo-Hill coefficients in neurons, except for RO 5-4864 and PK 11195, were distinctly lower than one. Thus, the benzodiazepine binding sites had profoundly different pharmacological characteristics in neurons and in astrocytes.", 
    "51": "The pharmacokinetic disposition of temazepam was compared after a day-time and night-time dose in an open randomised crossover study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg temazepam in a soft gelatine capsule at 0900 h or 2200 h. Blood samples were taken immediately before dosing and at selected times over the 36-h period after each dose. The absorption of temazepam was slower after evening administration; the absorption half-life and time to reach maximal plasma concentration being 0.53 h and 1.67 h respectively, compared to 0.38 h and 1.02 h following morning administration. Considering distribution characteristics, evening administration produced a lower peak plasma temazepam concentration (362 ng/ml) compared with a day-time level of 510 ng/ml. Distribution half-life after night-time administration was increased compared with day-time administration (1.76 h vs 1.03 h). A significantly higher percentage of the drug, relative to Cmax, remained in the plasma at 8 and 24 h after evening dosing (39.3 and 15.4% compared to 24.7 and 11.2% following day-time administration). In spite of the half-lives of absorption, distribution and elimination all being longer after the evening dose, the overall bioavailability, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) was comparable after the two times of administration. Similarly the difference in the mean residence time (MRT) of the two doses was within accepted limits. It is concluded that a chronopharmacokinetic effect was seen for temazepam; however it is unlikely to be of any clinical significance.", 
    "52": "CL 218,872, which preferentially binds to benzodiazepine (BZ) type 1 receptors, and flurazepam, which is thought to bind to both types 1 and 2, were given alone and in combination to rats. CL 218,872 had little effect on sleep latency, but significantly increased total sleep time. As expected, flurazepam both shortened sleep latency and prolonged total sleep. Pretreatment with CL 218,872 had no effect on these alterations in sleep induced by flurazepam. The implications for possible significance of sub-typing of BZ receptors are discussed.", 
    "53": "For two decades it has been hypothesized that schizophrenia and depression are related to alterations in the activity of specific neurotransmitters in brain; to a great extent, these theories are based on the assumed mode of action of antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs. With the available knowledge of how panic anxiety can be effectively treated (and elicited) with drugs, it is now reasonable to formulate hypotheses also regarding the contribution of central neurotransmitters to the generation of panic. As will be discussed in this brief review, three substances seem to be of particular importance in this context: serotonin, noradrenaline and GABA. In view of this concept, the putative mode of action of the atypical benzodiazepine derivative alprazolam, which in contrast to other benzodiazepines has been attributed effectiveness in the treatment of panic, will also be discussed.", 
    "54": "The effects of diazepam and medazepam, administered repeatedly orally, on the secretion of thyrotropic hormone and prolactin in male sexually matured albino rats were investigated under conditions of acute cold and immobilization stress. The agents were administered for 30 days in doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg for diazepam, and 1 and 10 mg/kg for medazepam. Sixty minutes after the last injection, the animals were placed under conditions of low temperature--+4 degrees C (cold stress) and of immobilization (immobilization stress) for 60 min. The content of thyrotropic hormone (TTH) and of prolactin in the serum of the control and experimental animals was determined using radioimmunological methods. Diazepam and medazepam were found to inhibit prolactin secretion under stress, affecting TTH secretion only in high doses: 5 mg/kg diazepam and 10 mg/kg medazepam. The TTH content was reduced under conditions of cold stress. The role of GABA and of the benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system in the regulation of the secretion of prolactin and TTH under states of stress is discussed.", 
    "55": ".1 mg/kg e.v. of chlordesmethyldiazepam, a 1.4 benzodiazepine derivative, were given in induction of anaesthesia of 60 plastic-reconstructive surgery patients respectively in 30 (Group 1.30 patients) and in 60 sec (Group 2.30 patients) to assess the times to spontaneous closing of the eyes and to disappearance of the palpebral reflex. It is concluded that the reflex times are not significantly different in both groups.", 
    "56": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled sleep-laboratory study the short-term effects of cinolazepam--a recently introduced 1,4 benzodiazepine with a half-life of 9 h--on the all-night sleep, morning awakening and early morning behaviour were investigated in 20 young normal subjects, whose sleep was experimentally disturbed by nocturnal traffic noise. The latter was prerecorded on tape and reproduced by loud speakers throughout the night with a sound pressure level of 68-90 dB(A) (energy equivalent mean noise level LAeq: 79dB(A)). According to the parallel group design subjects received either a placebo or 40 mg cinolazepam. Specifically, they spent nine nights in the sleep laboratory: two adaptation nights, one baseline night on placebo, three drug or placebo nights, and three post-drug/placebo nights under traffic noise. Somnopolygraphic investigations were carried out between 22h30 and 06h00. The drug was given orally half an hour before bedtime. Each 30 sec epoch was scored according to the criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales. In the morning the subjects were awakened by 1000 Hz tones which were increased in loudness in 10 dB steps in two minute intervals. A sleep self-rating scale for sleep and awakening quality was completed half an hour after the morning toilet. Thereafter noopsychic and thymopsychic variables were evaluated utilizing a psychometric test battery. Statistical analyses of objective sleep variables demonstrated a significant improvement of sleep maintenance after 40 mg cinolazepam as reflected by an increase of sleep efficiency, decrease of wake time (during total sleep period) and number of awakenings as compared with the placebo. Sleep architecture was only affected slightly: sleep stage S1 decreased, S2 increased, while S3, S4 and SREM (S rapid eye movement) remained unchanged. Subjective sleep quality improved significantly as well. In the mornings there were no hangover signs, neither in subjective nor in objective psychometric and psychophysiological variables. Finally, the study suggests that man can adapt subjectively to nocturnal traffic noise over one week, although the improvement of objective sleep variables over time did not reach the level of statistical significance.", 
    "57": "1. Benzodiazepines and strong analgesics raise considerably the ventricular fibrillation threshold and thus electrically stabilize the heart in the early stage of myocardial ischaemia. 2. Benzodiazepines markedly potentiate the electrostabilizing effect of the beta-blocker metipranolol. 3. Trimecaine per se does not electrically stabilize the heart in the first hour of ischaemia. When combined with a benzodiazepine, trimecaine stabilizes the heart also in this early stage of myocardial ischaemia. 4. Infusion of a benzodiazepine (midazolam) combined with fractionated administration of a potent analgesic (fentanyl) does not produce pronounced changes in the haemodynamics and ventilation of healthy subjects. 5. Benzodiazepines and strong analgesics exert a favourable effect on the neurovegetative stress response in the early stage of acute myocardial ischaemia. They can be therefore recommended as a component in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "58": "Thirty-one epileptic patients with seizures refractory to conventional anticonvulsants were treated by adding clorazepate dipotassium to their regimen. Twelve cases showed improvement in seizure frequency, three of whom attained a seizure free state. Response to clorazepate was not related to the type of epilepsy, but patients with secondary generalized epilepsy tended to be less responsive than those with partial epilepsy. Among the various seizure types, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and simple partial seizures showed, although not significant, a tendency to be more responsive to clorazepate therapy than other seizure types, including complex partial seizures, atypical absence, atonic seizures, and tonic seizures. Drowsiness was the main adverse effect, of which 14 patients complained. Six patients were withdrawn from clorazepate because of drowsiness, but in the remaining 8 patients, this side effect disappeared within a week. The appearance of adverse effect was not related to the dose of clorazepate given. Clorazepate may be an effective secondary anticonvulsant in the treatment of intractable epilepsy.", 
    "59": "All 24 Benzo- and Thienodiazepines which are used in drugs in the FRG were added to drug free urine in different concentrations and examined by Emit ST as well as by TLC. In addition the acid hydrolysis products of diazepines were analysed by TLC. A modification of the extraction procedure is described, which shortens analysis time considerably. The detection limits were determined and it will be discussed how both methods, Emit and TLC, are suited for a wide-ranging drug screening program.", 
    "60": "Effects of alcohol (ethanol) and acetaldehyde on the metabolism and function of primary cultured GABAergic neurons and that of salsolinol, a condensation product of acetaldehyde with dopamine, on cerebral GABA/benzodiazepine (BZP) receptor complex were investigated. In vitro addition of acetaldehyde induced a significant reduction not only on the content of GABA but also on the basal and GABA-activated [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FLN) bindings in primary cultured neurons. In contrast, alcohol exhibited only suppressive effects on [3H]FLN binding as well as on the enhancement of [3H]FLN binding by GABA. On the other hand, salsolinol showed a significant stimulatory effect on [3H]FLN binding to cerebral particulate fractions obtained from alcohol-untreated mice in the presence of NaCl. Although a similar activation of cerebral [3H]FLN binding by salsolinol was found in alcohol-treated mice, this activation was significantly weaker in alcohol-withdrawn mice than those found in alcohol-untreated as well as alcohol-inhaled mice. These results strongly suggest that acetaldehyde may have more important pathophysiological roles than those of alcohol in the exhibition of neurotoxicity during alcohol intake. The present results also suggest that salsolinol may have a modulatory role on cerebral benzodiazepine receptor and the decreased capacity of such a modulating mechanism may be involved in the exhibition of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, possibly by decreasing the function of endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine receptor in the brain.", 
    "61": "This short review describes the benzodiazepine receptors, their interplay with GABAergic transmission and chloride ionophore, the search for endogenous ligands, and the drug responses that can be evoked through these receptors. Benzodiazepine receptors offer a unique pathway through which opposite drug actions e.g., anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects can be exerted, and these actions can be inhibited with competitive receptor antagonists. The most plausible endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors discovered so far, a polypeptide DBI, exerts actions opposite to those of the benzodiazepines used in clinical therapy. This has been the stimulus for a new look at the physiological role for these receptors.", 
    "62": "The actions of clinically used anticonvulsant drugs on sustained high frequency repetitive firing of action potentials and on responses to gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been determined using mouse neurons in cell culture, and a classification of anticonvulsant drug actions has been developed based on these cellular actions. Actions of the anticonvulsant drugs were accepted as clinically relevant only if they occurred at concentrations achieved in cerebrospinal fluid or in plasma unbound to plasma proteins. Based on their cellular mechanisms of actions, drugs have been divided into 3 categories: (1) Phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproic acid limited sustained high frequency repetitive firing but did not alter GABA responses. (2) Phenobarbital and the benzodiazepines, clonazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam, augmented postsynaptic GABA responses. These drugs limited sustained high frequency repetitive firing only at concentrations above the therapeutic range in ambulatory patients, but equal to concentrations achieved in the acute treatment of status epilepticus. (3) Ethosuximide failed to reduce sustained high frequency repetitive firing or enhance GABA responses even at supertherapeutic concentrations. Limitation of sustained high frequency repetitive firing by anticonvulsant drugs correlated well with efficacy against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in man and against maximal electroshock seizures in experimental animals. Enhancement of postsynaptic GABA responses correlated with efficacy against generalized absence seizures in man and against pentylenetetrazol seizures in animals. Ethosuximide, however, did not alter GABA responses or sustained high frequency repetitive firing suggesting that its action against generalized absence seizures in man and pentylenetetrazol seizures in experimental animals occurs by an additional, as yet unknown, mechanism.", 
    "63": "The article deals with questions related to the use of paracorporal automatic drug-administering devices designed for the prolonged administration of psychotropic drugs. This is the first ever experience with the use of artificial systems for drug administration in psychiatry. The authors have developed a scheme of drug administration and determined the optimal rate of injection and daily doses. Possible complications and side effects associated with this method of treatment, as well as the methods for their prevention and control are described in detail. According to preliminary data the administration of psychotropic drugs with the help of automatic devices may contribute significantly to the improvement of social adaptation of patients with minor mental disturbances and make easier the provision of psychotherapy, in particular it may considerably simplify functional training of patients with phobic abnormalities. The method appears to be especially promising with regard to maintenance therapy.", 
    "64": "In a 8-week double-blind placebo controlled study, 48 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder were randomized to diazepam, buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, or placebo. During the treatment phase of 4 weeks duration diazepam was found to be significantly better than placebo and buspirone. Following abrupt withdrawal by placebo substitution the diazepam group showed a gradual relapse maximal after two weeks while the buspirone and the placebo groups did not differ. There were more cases of rebound anxiety with diazepam as compared to buspirone or placebo. In addition, there were three early terminations related to rebound anxiety in the diazepam group while there were none in the placebo and buspirone groups. There were significantly more new symptoms in the diazepam group than in the placebo or buspirone group.", 
    "65": "Factors influencing brain uptake of benzodiazepine derivatives were evaluated in adult Sprague Dawley rats (n = 8-10 per drug). Animals received single intraperitoneal doses of alprazolam, triazolam, lorazepam, flunitrazepam, diazepam, midazolam, desmethyldiazepam, or clobazam. Concentrations of each drug (and metabolites) in whole brain and serum 1 h after dosage were determined by gas chromatography. Serum free fraction was measured by equilibrium dialysis. In vitro binding affinity (apparent Ki) of each compound was estimated based on displacement of tritiated flunitrazepam in washed membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex. Lipid solubility of each benzodiazepine was estimated using the reverse-phase liquid chromatographic (HPLC) retention index at physiologic pH. There was no significant relation between brain:total serum concentration ratio and either HPLC retention (r = 0.18) or binding Ki (r = -0.34). Correction of uptake ratios for free as opposed to total serum concentration yielded a highly significant correlation with HPLC retention (r = 0.78, P less than 0.005). However, even the corrected ratio was not correlated with binding Ki (r = -0.22). Thus a benzodiazepine's capacity to diffuse from systemic blood into brain tissue is much more closely associated with the physicochemical property of lipid solubility than with specific affinity. Unbound rather than total serum or plasma concentration most accurately reflects the quantity of drug available for diffusion.", 
    "66": "Interactions between the benzodiazepines (BZs) chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and midazolam (MDZ), the BZ antagonist R0 15-1788, the inverse BZ receptor agonists CGS 8216 and FG 7142, gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA), serotonin (5-HT), the 5-HT2 antagonist methysergide and the putative 5-HT agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were investigated using peripheral and intra-amygdaloid treatments. A multiple schedule consisting of rewarded, nonrewarded (Time out: TO) and conflict periods was used to compare in parallel effects on successive discrimination between rewarded and nonrewarded periods and punished responding. The three components were presented in both a fixed order (Experiment 1) and a random order (Experiments 2 and 3). Intra-amygdaloid treatments with GABA and the BZs selectively increased rates of punished responding. CDP given systemically, on the other hand, increased both TO and conflict rates, suggesting an additional impairment of discrimination, which was more marked in the random than the fixed order condition. R0 15-1788, CGS 8216 and FG 7142 given by both routes counteracted the anti-conflict effects of CDP given centrally or systemically. However increases in TO rates induced by IP CDP were antagonized only by IP treatments with these compounds. The two inverse agonists, but not R0 15-1788, also counteracted increases in punished responding which were found after intra-amygdaloid GABA infusions. In Experiments 2 and 3 where baseline rates of pressing in Conflict periods were sufficiently high to detect decreases, CGS 8216 and FG 7142 reduced responding below control level, suggesting a specific anxiogenic activity. Evidence for effects of R0 15-1788 by itself was inconclusive. 5-HT injected into the amygdala also reduced punished responding below control level, whereas methysergide increased it with both central and peripheral treatment. Effects of 8-OH-DPAT varied according to route of administration. With IP treatment Conflict rates were increased, but after amygdaloid infusion both TO and Conflict rates were marginally reduced below control level, with a more consistent depression of punished responding. These results provide evidence that effects of BZs on punished responding are mediated by a GABAergic system which includes the lateral/basolateral amygdala, but which does not participate in BZ-induced disruption of discrimination. They also indicate that the antagonistic effects of CGS 8216 and FG 7142 involve a decrease in GABA transmission, and that these compounds may also be anxiogenic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The pharmacological activity of quazepam, a BZ1 specific benzodiazepine, was compared to the effects of triazolam, a BZ1, BZ2 nonspecific benzodiazepine. Using a double-blind procedure, single oral doses of quazepam (15 or 30 mg), triazolam (0.5 or 1.0 mg) and placebo were administered to 21 healthy young men according to a random Latin square design balanced for order of drug administration. The drug effects on the performance of motor coordination and cognitive tasks were monitored for 7 h following drug ingestion. The results did not indicate any differential effects on cognitive-neuromotor performance for the BZ1 specific quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam compared with the BZ1, BZ2 nonspecific N-desalkylflurazepam metabolite. The impairment magnitude for 30 mg quazepam was closer to that of 0.5 mg triazolam. The onset of the initial drug effect was considerably slower for quazepam than for triazolam. The time course of the impairment profiles for the tasks was compared to pharmacokinetic data from previous studies and suggested that published pharmacokinetic rate constants explain only a limited portion of the impairment time course. In particular, the performance scores were already showing recovery from peak impairment 2 h post-drug ingestion, although quazepam's potent N-desalkylflurazepam metabolite has been found to maintain a maximum plateau level from 2 to 24 h.", 
    "68": "Benzodiazepines, used in the clinic as anxiolytics, have in animal models been found specifically to attenuate behavioural suppression caused by response contigent aversive stimuli, non-reward or novelty. The effects have been interpreted in more general terms as \"behavioural disinhibition\" or \"response perseveration\" or in more specific terms as reduced \"reward delay\" or as an attenuation of a \"behavioural inhibition system\". In a recent publication we have described an experimental test in which decision making in the rat can be studied. The model is derived from ethology, in particular from optimal foraging theory. In order to solve the task, the animal must choose correctly between two options. For each option the probability of its resulting in a reward (water) has to be estimated on the basis of available information and to be related to the cost of performing it. We found that diazepam, in a dose that did not significantly affect the ability to perform the options per se, caused a strong impairment when these options, on the basis of available information, had to be combined into functional sequences in a decision making procedure. The results obtained cannot be explained on the basis of disinhibition or response perseveration. The hypothesis is advanced that benzodiazepines alter decision making in a more nonspecific may, by, for example, affecting the evaluation of the learned significance of stimuli in the environment.", 
    "69": "Rats with a history of daily (21 days) amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg) treatment showed enhanced activity when under placebo in their amphetamine-associated environment. We found that this conditioned effect was reduced by haloperidol (0.06; 0.125; 0.25 mg/kg), pimozide (0.25; 0.5 mg/kg) and sulpiride (8; 16; 32 mg/kg) but only at doses similar to or, in the case of pimozide, higher than those required to antagonize the unconditioned stimulant effects of amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg). Conversely, we observed that clonidine (7; 15; 30; 60 micrograms/kg) or lithium regimen (between days 15 and 21) leading to lithium plasma levels of 1.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/l, abolished amphetamine-conditioned hyperactivity but did not affect the unconditioned stimulation of amphetamine or locomotor activity in control rats. Moreover, we found that hyperactivity induced by the daily anticipation of food delivery shared identical pharmacological sensitivity with the behavioural excitation produced by a conditioning history with amphetamine. In light of the antimanic properties of lithium and clonidine and the ability of this latter drug to reduce noradrenergic transmission, our findings raise the possibility that incentive activity may model noradrenergic-dependent aspects of mania.", 
    "70": "Simultaneous administration of cimetidine and many benzodiazepine anxiolytics has resulted in decreased body clearance and marked prolongation of the half-life of these agents. The pharmacokinetic interaction of buspirone, a new nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic, and cimetidine was studied in 10 healthy male volunteers. Each received, in order, buspirone 45 mg/day (days 1-7), no drug (days 8-14), cimetidine 1 g/day (days 15-21), buspirone 45 mg/day plus cimetidine 1 g/day (days 22-28), and cimetidine 1 g/day (days 29-31). Buspirone and 1-pyrimidinyl piperazine (1-PP), an active metabolite, pharmacokinetics, urinary excretion of cimetidine, a manual dexterity test, the Stroop color-word interference test, and a visual analog mood scale were evaluated on each treatment. There were no significant (p greater than 0.05) differences among treatments for any measurement except for a slight (31%) but significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the 1-PP Cmax value. These results suggest that within the normal therapeutic dosage ranges for both drugs, it is unlikely that a clinically significant interaction between them will occur.", 
    "71": "The effects on memory and psychomotor performance and the subjective effects of three anxiolytic benzodiazepines (lorazepam 2 mg, diazepam 10 mg and clobazam 20 mg p.o.) have been evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 10 healthy volunteers. At each session, measurements were made prior to and +3.5 h after drug administration, except in the case of REY's test, which was presented at H + 1 h (learning) and was evaluated at H + 8 h and at H + 24 h (delayed recall). Single clinical doses of diazepam and lorazepam caused anterograde amnesia by disturbing acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. Clobazam did not impair memory. Lorazepam impaired performances in all the tests used to evaluate perception, immediate memory, reaction time, psychomotor skill and intellectual capacity. Diazepam caused a decrease in cortical arousal and the speed of perception of visual stimuli, whereas clobazam increased reaction time and reduced cortical arousal. Lorazepam caused a significant degradation of performance relative to the other two treatments.", 
    "72": "Mice were treated with 0.025% alprazolam incorporated into their laboratory chow for periods of one, two, and four weeks. Treated animals gained weight and appeared healthy during treatment, although an increased number of animals were lost in the treatment groups due to cannibalism. When regular food was substituted, alprazolam-treated animals experienced a withdrawal reaction qualitatively similar to that previously observed following similar lengths of treatment with 0.1% diazepam in food. The withdrawal reaction following alprazolam had a faster onset and a shorter time course, and was less intense. In a separate experiment, eight mice were treated with alprazolam for two weeks but were housed singly. This eliminated the cannibalism problem and no animals were lost during the treatment phase; the withdrawal syndrome was similar to that seen in group-housed animals. The model of benzodiazepine dependence in mice would appear to generalize to the entire class of drugs and may permit distinctions to be made between the time-course of withdrawal reactions between the various members of that class.", 
    "73": "Since the advent of modern psychopharmacology in the 1950s, use of medications in the treatment of many psychiatric disorders has become commonplace. Alcohol use is also widespread. As alcohol can interact with a wide variety of medications to alter drug effects, understanding the interactions between it and psychiatric medicines is important to the efficacious treatment of the depressed alcoholic with these drugs. This article briefly outlines the effects of alcohol and the mechanisms of its interactions with psychiatric medications. The most commonly used classes of psychiatric medicines, including antidepressants, CNS depressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, psychostimulants, and lithium carbonate, are reviewed as to their potential interactions with alcohol. Clinical implications of these interactions are discussed.", 
    "74": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed, and in 1979 almost 10% of the adult population was taking them. Prior studies of outpatient usage of benzodiazepines have relied on survey or prescription data, which may be confounded by noncompliance. To determine the actual use of benzodiazepines, plasma benzodiazepine concentrations were measured in 225 consecutive outpatients from a university cardiology outpatient service. Self reports indicated that the great majority of the patients (191) were taking at least one medicine, and 70 reported being on a psychotropic drug. Seventy-seven patients reported taking benzodiazepines, the majority being on bromazepam (20), diazepam (26) or oxazepam (19). In 25 of those 77 patients, the reported drug could not be detected in plasma. Conversely, in 10 of the 225 patients, benzodiazepines which were not reported were detected (diazepam or flurazepam). Of those taking benzodiazepines, many had a low concentration, suggesting intermittent rather than regular use. Thus, many patients for whom benzodiazepines are prescribed take them irregularly, and a small group uses them without reporting their prescription. These findings have implications for the clinical presentation of illness and for the possibility of drug interactions.", 
    "75": "Evidence from published studies and clinical experience indicates that neuroleptic drugs, tricyclic and heterocyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants, and lithium all possess varying abilities to increase appetite, stimulate carbohydrate craving, and cause weight gain over prolonged periods of administration. Sedatives and benzodiazepine-type antianxiety drugs fail to stimulate appetite or induce weight gain, and it is unlikely that the sedative or calming effects of other psychotropic drugs contribute significantly to changes in appetite or weight. Studies of the endocrine and metabolic aspects of psychotropic drugs suggest that these mechanisms do not contribute significantly to explaining the observed effects on appetite or weight. Numerous studies indicate that a wide variety of compounds, including the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, the serotonin receptor stimulant, fenfluramine, and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, are all capable of decreasing carbohydrate hunger, reducing consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods, and inhibiting weight gain in humans and animals. Widely divergent psychotropic drugs produce antagonistic effects at serotonin receptor sites, and it is likely that this action contributes to their ability to stimulate appetite, carbohydrate craving, and weight gain. Those psychotropic drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake mechanisms, increasing serotonin activity within the central nervous system, either fail to stimulate carbohydrate hunger and weight gain or are actually capable of decreasing carbohydrate craving and facilitating weight loss. Because many antidepressants, including trazodone and amitriptyline, the neuroleptic, chlorpromazine, and the mood stabilizer, lithium, may all, under some circumstances, inhibit serotonin reuptake mechanisms and may simultaneously block serotonin receptor sites, their effects on appetite and weight gain may represent a balance between serotonergic and antiserotonin activities. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which slow the metabolic degradation of monoamines, including serotonin and norepinephrine, allow for increased levels of these neurotransmitters within the brain. It is conceivable that the relative noradrenergic effect related to an amphetamine-like structure of tranylcypromine may explain its lesser ability to stimulate appetite and weight gain than the appetite and weight effects observed with phenelzine. Furthermore, the production of dry mouth and thirst by psychotropic drugs appears to contribute to weight gain, secondary to consumption of high-calorie beverages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Eleven benzodiazepines were evaluated in the staircase test in mice. The behavioural parameters measured were the number of steps climbed and the number of rears during a 3-min test. Climbing and to a lesser extent rears were enhanced at low doses, whereas both parameters, particularly rearing, were reduced at higher doses. The differential effects of the drugs on the two parameters were used to determine indices of anxiolytic efficacy for each drug where increases in climbing were taken to indicate the onset of anxiolytic activity and decreases in rearing the onset of sedative activity. The compounds could be ranked according to these indices in a manner which appears to reflect their therapeutic profile in man.", 
    "77": "Nearly every category of psychotropic drug has been investigated in an attempt to find a pharmacologic treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This study reviews published trials from the English literature in which tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, and other agents were employed for treatment of OCD. Weaknesses in the current methodology including diagnosis, measurement of severity and criteria for improvement have contributed to invalid conclusions about drug treatment and efficacy. It appears that OCD is an etiologically heterogeneous disorder with a complex differential diagnosis. For the clinician, a major conclusion drawn from this review is that no agent emerges as a drug of choice. Although clorimipramine, the most actively investigated agent, shows some promise, it has not been conclusively demonstrated that other, more readily available heterocyclic agents are less effective. Furthermore, when other disorders co-exist, such as panic disorder, alternative agents may prove as effective.", 
    "78": "Certain CNS-active compounds decrease gastric acid secretion in vivo. In this study a number of tricyclic antipsychotic or antidepressant compounds together with haloperidol, a nontricyclic antipsychotic agent, were shown to inhibit dibutyryl-cAMP-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine uptake, an index of acid secretory activity in a rat isolated gastric mucosal cell preparation. The observed order of potency was: thioridazine greater than chlorpromazine greater than haloperidol approximately equal to desipramine approximately equal to imipramine greater than clozapine. Comparison of these potencies with those of the known (H+ + K+)ATPase inhibitors timoprazole and omeprazole revealed that the potency of timoprazole was similar to the one of clozapine while omeprazole was intermediate between thioridazine and chlorpromazine. Pirenzepine was ineffective.", 
    "79": "Adverse drug reactions not only occur more frequently but are also of a more severe nature in the elderly. For warfarin and many of the psychoactive drugs, this is due mainly to an increased pharmacodynamic sensitivity to the actions of these drugs. For a number of other drugs, old age is associated with changes in their distribution and eventual elimination from the body. This increases the risk of a relative overdose during routine use of the drug. Such risks can be minimised by the judicious adjustment of the dosages of these drugs.", 
    "80": "A case is reported of massive drug self-poisoning (more than 200 pills associated with slices of oranges) in which repeated gastric lavage failed to empty the stomach. An attempt to split up the amalgamated pills, adherent to the gastric mucosa, by fibre-optic gastroscopy failed and a gastrotomy was required. Endoscopy together with gastric lavage is indicated in certain situations to quickly empty the stomach and so shorten the course of the poisoning. Indications are the large number of pills swallowed, a poor result of the treatment, a worsening of the clinical condition despite treatment, and three positive gastric toxicological assays within the first 24 h."
