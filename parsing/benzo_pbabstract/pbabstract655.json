    "0": "Phencyclidine (PCP) is a potent sympathomimetic and hallucinogenic dissociative anesthetic agent. As an abused street drug, it is most often smoked, thus allowing the user to titrate the dose. The clinical signs of PCP intoxication can be viewed in three dose-related stages, but waxing and waning of signs through the three stages is not uncommon. Treatment protocols for each stage address drug therapy and both clinical and psychological supportive measures.", 
    "1": "Forty-six consecutive patients who voluntarily sought outpatient treatment for abuse of one or more prescription drugs were studied. Barbiturates, amphetamines, and diazepam were the most common drugs abused. Desired treatments by patients included counseling, medical withdrawal, or medical maintenance with the drug of abuse or a chemically related drug. Twenty-two (47.8%) patients left treatment and relapsed within one month; another eight (17.4%) patients relapsed between one and three months after entering treatment. Only 13 (28.3%) reported abstinence 90 days after entering treatment. This experience suggests that a wide range of medical, social, and psychologic resources are required to treat prescription drug abuse, and that long-term drug abstinence is difficult to achieve with all patients.", 
    "2": "The effects of diazepam and pethidine, when given as preanaesthetic medication, on the induction of anaesthesia and the postanaesthetic sequelae following etomidate were studied in women undergoing minor gynaecological procedures. Pain on injection was present in all the groups. However, the frequency was significantly less with the polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol formulations of the drug compared with the aqueous solution. A fast injection and pethidine premedication decreased the frequency also. The high frequency of excitatory phenomena in unpremedicated patients was decreased significantly by premedication with diazepam and pethidine, especially the latter. Respiratory and cardiovascular effects of the drug were not major problems. The frequency of emetic sequelae was high. Recovery was rapid even in the groups receiving sedative premedication.", 
    "3": "The potency of five i.v. anaesthetics (thiopentone, ketamine, alphaxalone (Althesin), propanidid and diazepam) was studied by determining the dose required to produce unconsciousness in 50% (UD50) and 95% (UD95) of patients. UD50 and UD95 were determined using the probit method. The effect of age on the anaesthetic requirement has been studied also. Relative to thiopentone, the potency was alphaxalone 9.22, diazepam 5.24, ketamine 4.37 and propanidid 1.006.", 
    "4": "The effect of diazepam and nitrazepam (0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg) on GABA-transaminase activity in the rat cerebellar cortex and hippocampus was investigated by quantitative histochemistry. Both the drugs suppressed the enzyme activity in the hippocampus; the maximal effect was produced by diazepam. It is suggested that the observed alterations are caused by the enzyme inhibition and also by a decrease of GABA turnover rate.", 
    "5": "Chronic experiments were conducted on rats. A study was made of the effect of diazepam (in a dose of 4 mg/kg of body weight) on the specific and nonspecific mechanisms of experimentally-induced photogenic epilepsy developing as a result of tetanus toxin injection into the lateral geniculate body (LGB) and formation in this nucleus of a pathologically enhanced excitation generator (PEEG). Diazepam in the mentioned dose had a relatively weak effect on the extent of pathological enhancement of the sensory visual signal in the LGB under conditions of PEEG formation aided detection of focal interictal discharges in this nucleus, and completely inhibited generalized epileptic activity in experimental animals in the course of one hour.", 
    "6": "The readaptation time (RAT) is the interval during which a person exposed to a bright intense light flash cannot perceive a given target. In this study the target used was an optokinetic pattern and the elicited nystagmus (OKN) was registered with electrooculography (EOG), thus giving an objective registration of RAT. Oxazepam in therapeutic doses was given to five healthy subjects and the RAT and serum concentrations of the drug were registered simultaneously at different time intervals. An almost parallel increase of RAT and serum concentration of oxazepam was recorded. This suggests that RAT reflects the depressant effect on the CNS of this drug and it may be used as an objective method of following the clinical effect of a depressant drug as a function of time after intake.", 
    "7": "The anaesthetic requirements for peripheral angiographies in geriatric or poor risk patients are temporary sedation, analgesia and sufficient immobilisation. Neither general anaesthesia using muscle relaxants and assisted ventilation nor regional methods warrant satisfactory results in all cases, especially if multiple arteriographies are to be performed at the same session. Therefore a few new anaesthetic techniques were studied, having combined benzodiazepines with ultrashort acting intravenous narcotics. Premedication with Pethidin 1mg/kg, the administration of Flunitrazepam 0,017 mg/kg with regard to sedative, analgesic and relaxant effects and Methohexital 0.67 mg/kg as anaesthetic given prior to injection of contrast medium would seem more useful than other techniques.", 
    "8": "Regional anaesthesia secured by injecting the supraclavicular plexus was used for 34 reconstructive surgical operations on the fingers and hands. The operations lasted for 5 1/2-19 hours. The advantages and disadvantages of the technique are reviewed. In 5 cases other anaesthetic techniques had to be substituted because the patients, despite sedation, could not tolerate the forced position any longer. Motivation, intensive psychic support during the operation, optimum positioning and the use of suitable sedatives are pre-conditions for the success of nerve block for prolonged surgery.", 
    "9": "The ten drugs most frequently prescribed in 1977 are identified according to proprietary and non-proprietary names, pharmaceutical manufacturer, drug class, principal uses, and the ocular side effects which have been reported in the medical literature.", 
    "10": "The use of antiepileptic drugs has become increasingly effective through several factors: new techniques that allow better diagnosis of the seizure disorder and its underlying cause; the development of new medications and increased knowledge of old ones; and the widespread use of antiepileptic drug-level determinations. The choice of a drug depends heavily on an accurate diagnosis of seizure type, which may determine the response to the medication. Because of better diagnostic criteria and intensive monitoring procedures, the correct seizure disorder can be more easily diagnosed and, therefore, the proper medication selected. Minimal efficacious and toxic blood concentrations have now been identified for most antiepileptic drugs. Several, including primidone, carbamazepine, methsuximide, and mephenytoin, have pharmacologically active metabolites that affect both the toxicity and efficacy of the prescribed drug and can now be measured in the plasma. The most effective use of the antiepileptic drugs depends on a combination of reliable blood level measurements, clinical observation, and knowledge of their pharmacokinetics and biotransformation.", 
    "11": "In an attempt to know whether the existing anticonvulsants act on epileptogenic focus, the effect on SA induced by freezing of the visual cortex was examined in gallamine-immobilized cats. The SA was localized in the neighbor or ipsilateral cortex of the freezing area; little epileptiform activity was produced in the contralateral anterior cortex, and ipsilateral thalamus and hippocampus. Spike frequency and its amplitude were stable over 8 hr. Diazepam suppressed SA and decreased spike frequency and its amplitude. Dipropylacetate and acetazolamide also suppressed SA. On the other hand, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and a high dose of phenytoin enhanced SA and increased the spike frequency. Low doses of phenytoin and trimethadione were without effect in this aspect. Taurine suppressed SA and changed the spikes to wave-like forms. The EEG arousal response was depressed with phenobarbital, carbamazepine, diazepam, and a high dose of phenytoin, but not with the other drugs examined. From these results, it is suggested that diazepam, dipropylacetate, acetazolamide, and taurine depress the epileptogenic focus activity itself without relation to the activating system.", 
    "12": "Two endogenous ligands for the brain benzodiazepine-binding sites were isolated from bovine brain through gel filtration, paper electrophoresis, and paper chromatography. These ligands were identified as inosine and hypoxanthine, and both had a higher affinity for the brain benzodiazepine-binding sites than for benzodiazepine sites in some peripheral tissues. They did not bind to any other receptors tested, such as the opiate, muscarinic cholinergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and beta-adrenergic receptors. Both inosine and hypoxanthine competitively inhibited the binding of [3H]diazepam to the brain binding site.", 
    "13": "The effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on high-affinity binding of benzodiazepines to brain membranes has been investigated. GABA stimulated [3H]diazepam binding by more than 100% when extensively washed membranes from brain tissue were used. This GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding occurred in all brain regions examined. The stimulation was specific for GABA agonist. It was inhibited by the GABA receptor blocker bicuculline methiodide. A large number of compounds structurally closely related to GABA but without direct effect on the GABA receptor failed to enhance [3H]diazepam binding. The stimulation of benzodiazepine binding was caused by an increase in affinity; the number of binding sites remained unchanged. Half-maximal activation of [3H]diazepam binding occurred in the presence of 300 nM muscimol or 900 nM GABA. beta-Guanidinopropionic acid and imidazoleacetic acid were much weaker activators. It is suggested that the described stimulation of benzodiazepine high-affinity binding is mediated by a receptor for GABA. This site of GABA action exhibits different properties when compared to GABA receptors, as characterized by high-affinity binding of GABA agonists.", 
    "14": "An attempt was made to reduce pain during femoral angiography by adding 1 mg. of Lidocaine/ml. contrast medium in the course of 95 examinations. In a further 87 patients, Diazepam was injected intravenously before the injection of the contrast-Lidocaine mixture. Pain and the feeling of heat was compared with a control group who received contrast medium with 10% physiological saline. There was a highly significant reduction in pain sensation as a result of Lidocaine; pain was further reduced by additional Diazepam, which also reduced heat sensation, but resulted in a fall in blood pressure. High risk patients did not suffer any significant complications. Lidocaine is well suited for out patients, but Diazepam requires a longer period of observation. General anaesthesia has been used only if patients insisted on it or if there was known contrast reaction.", 
    "15": "The pharmacokinetic behavior of the 7-amino metabolite of clonazepam administered exogenously and formed endogenously from the parent drug was studied in a group of rhesus monkeys using constant rate intravenous infusions. Plasma levels of the 7-amino metabolite and/or clonazepam were determined with a GC-CI-MS method. The biological half-life of the 7-amino metabolite (2.2 +/- 1.0 hr) was shorter than that of clonazepam (4.9 +/- 0.2 hr). Total body clearance of the metabolite (0.83 +/- 0.16 liters/hr/kg) was larger than that of the parent drug (0.55 +/- 0.09 liters/hr/kg). The kinetics of in vivo biotransformation were described by a two-compartment model in which formation and disposition of the metabolite follow first-order processes. The fraction of a dose of clonazepam appearing in the systemic circulation as 7-amino metabolite was 0.70 +/- 0.30. This value may underestimate the actual fraction formed, if the metabolite is susceptible to first-pass metabolism following in situ formation.", 
    "16": "Recent advances in the diagnosis, management and prognosis of hypertension in pregnancy are discussed, with emphasis on antihypertensive drug treatment. The use of diuretics, alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, hydrallazine, beta-adrenergic blockers, diazoxide, chlormethiazole, diazepam and heparin is given special attention.", 
    "17": "The influence of analog-sedation on pulmonary respiration and cardiovascular circulation caused by the action of pentazocine/flunitrazepam respectively in microsurgical operations under local anesthesia in otolaryngology is investigated in two collectives of patients. The results are presented and the hazards, especially the hypoxemia and its avoidance are discussed.", 
    "18": "After premedication with flunitrazepam=Rohypnol 2 mg orally (2--3 hours preop.) and morphine-atropine (30 min preop.) the patient receives slowly \"Ro\" i.v. until the phenomenon of volume reduction when speaking is observed. This allows for the smallest possible dosis to achieve sufficient amnesia. After about 20 min the patient becomes responsive again, while his amnesia lasts for about 3 hours more. The cardiovascular functions remain stable with a 25% decrease of systolic blood pressure. Vomiting is reduced. The dry operative field makes microsurgery much easier and improves the final result of the operation. After gaining sufficient experience of the staff, 100% amnesia was achieved in all operations during the last 3 months.", 
    "19": "The sedative, hypnotic and amnesic effects of flunitrazepam, a new benzodiazepine, were tested in doses of 0 (placebo), 0,4 mg and 0,8 mg. These doses were sufficient to produce a satisfying sedative effect on patients, being operated on in regional anaesthesia. In few cases we found undesirable effects. Positive and negative aspects of amnesia will be discussed.", 
    "20": "In 32 patients between 53 and 86 years of age, undergoing transurethral prostatectomy, the influence of intraoperative sedation with Diazepam (5-10 mg) and Flunitrazepam (0,4-0,8 mg) on postoperative forced vital capacity, forced exspiratory volume (1 sec.) and peakflow, were measured, compared to placebo. We could not find a depression of these ventilatory parameters, in the three groups except peak-flow after sedation with Flunitrazepam in the evening after operation (p less than or equal to 0,05). We conclude that sedation during regional anesthesia does not impair the most important advantage of local anesthesia, the minor effect on ventilation, compared with general anesthesia.", 
    "21": "N-o-Methoxyphenylpiperazine (MPP) is a moderately effective in vivo blocker of dopaminergic receptors. Its ability to increase the concentration of rat brain homovanillic acid (HVA) and the resulting time course for HVA were similar to the actions of clozapine. The increased concentration of HVA did not result from decreased outflow from brain because HVA also rapidly decreased after a subsequent injection of pargyline. MPP blocked the circling behaviour caused by apomorphine in mice with a unilateral striatal lesion, and MPP and apomorphine reciprocally blocked the occurrence of stereotypy and increased HVA in rats. Diazepam partially prevented the MPP-induced elevation of HVA. Thus, both biochemical and pharmacological evidence indicate the dopaminergic blocking action of MPP.", 
    "22": "Tofisopam is a new agent marketed in Europe as a minor tranquilizer. The authors conducted a 4-week double-blind trial of this drug compared with placebo in 57 outpatients with anxiety and depression. They found that according to physician ratings and patient self-ratings tofisopam was an effective anxiolytic agent for subjects with anxiety and depression. Twenty-one percent of the patients receiving tofisopam and 10% of those receiving placebo reported side effects. The drug was especially effective in the treatment of somatic difficulties.", 
    "23": "Ninety-five adult outpatients suffering from moderate to severe anxiety were randomly assigned to treatment with lorazepam or placebo in a double-blind four-week study. Patients were evaluated at pretreatment and after two and four weeks of treatment using three rating scales. Lorazepam, at an average daily dose of 3.2 mg twice daily, was highly effective in relieving anxiety as documented by clinically and statistically significant differences over placebo in most of the items on all rating scales at all rating periods. No serious adverse effects were reported, and there were no adverse interactions with other medications, including digitalis and aspirin.", 
    "24": "Pigeons were exposed to a negative automaintenance schedule in which food was delivered following brief key illumination only if the illuminated key was not contacted; contact of the lighted key prevented food delivery. All subjects emitted some responses under this procedure when drugs were not given. However, the number of responses was less than that which occurred under an automaintenance procedure in which food followed key illumination regardless of the bird's behavior. Under the negative automaintenance procedure, acute administration of atropine (0.01--0.1 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (0.4--1.6 mg/kg), and morphine (3,8--15 mg/kg) reduced in a dose-dependent manner the percentage of key illuminations in which subjects contacted the lighted key. Diazepam (1.0--6.0 mg/kg) increased the percentage of key illuminations during contact responses occurred.", 
    "25": "The comporative effects of flurazepam, clorazepate, L-dopa, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on REM sleep were investigated in normal, healthy adults. A single dose of each drug was given orally to the subjects 30 min before bedtime. A dose of 30 mg flurazepam significantly decreased REM sleep-time when compared to the mean baseline record. No change was noted in REM sleep-time on the clorazepate (15 mg) night, L-dopa (1000 mg) night, or TRH (2 mg) night, when compared to the mean baseline record. Because large individual variations were found in REM sleep time on each drug night, and in percentage increase in REM sleep following partial differential REM deprivation (PDRD), correlation was investigated between them. The percentage decrease in REM sleep during flurazepam was found to have a significant negative correlation with the percentage increase in REM sleep after PDRD in individual subjects. Although there was no significant change in REM sleep on TRH night when compared to the mean baseline record, a similar significant negative correlation was noted. On the L-dopa night, there was a tendency toward a negative correlation between them. No significant correlation was noted on the clorazepate night.", 
    "26": "Eight normal subjects were tested on auditory and visual choice reaction time and Tapping-Speed Test before and after two hours by administration of lorazepam (2.5 mg per os). CRTs slightly increase but not significantly; Tapping-Speed Test does not show changes. Nevertheless a significant increase of errors in all trials suggest a moderate decrease of performance after lorazepam.", 
    "27": "Flurazepam (15 mg) was administered to 4 beagles in solution and in capsules. Blood levels of unchanged Flurazepam were measured by GLC using an electron capture detector. In the case of solution blood levels were measurable over a 2 hour period with the peak at 30 min in all dogs. In the case of capsules these levels were measurable in only one dog, which also showed the highest blood levels with the solution. Flurazepam is a drug which is rapidly metabolized into a series of metabolites. In the case of capsules the metabolization rate is more rapid than the enteral absorption rate, and consequently the blood levels of the unchanged drug are hardly measurable. The administration of Flurazepam in solution allows a more rapid enteral absorption rate and consequently the levels of the unchanged drug are measurable over a 2 hour period.", 
    "28": "The authors present a 60-year-old patient undergoing periodic hemodialysis who, 3 years after beginning the treatment, developed a clinical picture consisting of disturbances of language, motor dispraxia, loss of memory and concentration, irritability, great change of personality, myoclonias and asterixis. This led progressively to a total loss of motor coordination, including speech. He died 5 months later in a state of dementia, psychosis and incontinence of sphincters. The symptomatology increased after hemodialysis sessions. The normal analytical studies carried out in these cases (electrocardiogram, electromyography, complete roentgenologic study) and also Zn, Cu, and ceruloplasmin measurements were normal. The electroencephalogram showed only a slow tracing with delta waves. Various etiopathogenic possibilities are commented on, as for example alterations in the dialysis water, the use of detergents in cleaning the artificial kidney, a syndrome of imbalance, a decrease in the body potassium and poisoning caused by certain metals such as tin, zinc and aluminium or by drugs which contain benzodiazepine derivatives. The authors conclude that the picture corresponds to a metabolic encephalopathy.", 
    "29": "A double blind trial is described in which the effect of the specific gastric secretion inhibitor, Gastrozepin, was tested on gastric disturbances during treatment with the antirheumatic drug indometacin. It was shown on further treatment with indometacin and concomitant Gastrozepin therapy that the symptoms could be improved or completely relieved.", 
    "30": "Two patients are described who developed action, reflex myoclonus during acute renal failure. In both cases the myoclonus was abolished after the intravenous administration of clonazepam. We suggest that the characteristic action myoclonus, which occurs in both acute renal failure and postanoxic encephalopathy, is caused by a disturbance of function in the lower brainstem reticular formation.", 
    "31": "1. The metabolism and plasma kinetics of chlordiazepoxide have been determined in a group of volunteers and in a group of patients with acute alcohol intoxication. 2. Using the SAAM 26 non-linear least squares fitting programme, all chlordiazepoxide plasma concentration v time data following oral administration could be analysed in terms of a one-compartment open model with metabolic conversion of chlordiazepoxide to desmethylchlordiazepoxide. 3. Acutely intoxicated patients showed a prolonged elimination of chlordiazepoxide and a reduced clearance when compared with alcohol-free volunteers. The elimination of desmethylchlordiazepoxide, on the other hand, appeared to be faster in the alcoholics. 4. Alcohol exerts significant effects on the metabolism of chlordiazepoxide in acutely intoxicated patients.", 
    "32": "The clinical effects of oral oxazepam and placebo as premedicants were tested in a double-blind study in 40 gynaecological patients. The gas chromatographically measured concentrations of the active, unconjugated forms of oxazepam in the plasma were correlated with the clinical effects of oxazepam, assessed both subjectively and objectively. The insertion of an intravenous cannula was significantly more difficult (p less than 0.001) in the placebo premedicated group. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the cutaneous temperature of the left forefinger. Of the eleven parameters tested there was a significant difference between the oxazepam and placebo group in the quality of sleep on the night before operation (p less than 0.05) and in the degree of preoperative sedation (p less than 0.01). The combined results of the eleven parameters of the oxazepam group also differed positively significantly from the placebo group (p less than 0.01). There was no obvious relationship between the plasma concentration and clinical effect of oxazepam.", 
    "33": "The combined effects on mice of N2O and various central depressants were investigated. A loss of the righting reflex was taken as the criterion for the drug effects. Essential differences could be demonstrated in the type of interaction: diazepam, flunitrazepam, and medazepam have a supra-additive effect in combination with N2O; the solvent of diazepam and an experimental product, Ro 21-3981 (8-Chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo [1,5-a] [1,4]-benzodiazepine maleate) a simply additive one. However, the interactions between N2O and barbiturates (pentobarbitone and phenobarbitone), and N2O and ethanol were found to be infra-additive. The results of this and previous investigations indicate that additive or supra-additive interactions can only be expected in those cases in which at most one of the two active ingredients in addition to its depressive effect also exhibits an excitatory component.", 
    "34": "The series comprises 109 healthy females aged 14-49 years (mean age 28 years) hospitalized for legal abortion or diagnostic curettage. The patients were premedicated with morphine-scopolamine 0.4-0.7 ml i.m. (morphine 20 mg/ml, scopolamine 0.6 mg/ml) and atropine 0.01 mg/kg i.v. Ketamine 1.5 mg/kg was administered i.v. and immediately thereafter 2 ml of a coded solution i.v. consisting either of diazepam 10 mg or its solvent only. Supplementary doses of ketamine 0.2-0.4 mg/kg were administered when needed. Diazepam reduced the incidence of unpleasant dreams and experiences to a significant degree (p less than 0.01) according to the postanaesthetic interviews of the patients. Nausea occurred in the diazepam group in 2 per cent and in the placebo group in 17 per cent (p less than 0.01). In respect to the differences in opinion presented in literature the authors consider the time of administration of diazepam at induction to be of decisive importance and find prophylactic prevention of dreams justified as it cannot be predicted which of the patients will have unpleasant or even terrifying dreams. Dreams and/or experiences or their memories must be prevented at the stage at which the effect of ketamine commences. The authors do not, however, recommend ketamine anaesthesia for young adults, even when supplemented with diazepam. On the other hand, the authors consider the positive observations made during the study to be applicable to all other ketamine anaesthesias.",

Analytical properties of important derivatives (N-oxides, 3-acetoxy compounds, re-arrangement products) are also reported. Besides preparation methods are given for the synthesis of these substances, considering in particular preparation as solution-reactions as well as reaction on the TLC-plate.", 
    "36": "Psychoactivity, pharmacodynamic properties and drug tolerance of 2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f]1,2-(4-triazolo)[4,3-a][1,4]diazepine (WE 941), a new triazolodiazepine, were studied in 10 normal subjects utilizing quantitative pharmaco-EEG and clinical evaluation methods. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the subjects received randomized at weekly intervals oral single doses of 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg WE 941, placebo, and 30 mg flurazepam as reference substance. Measurements were obtained before and at the 2nd, 4th, 6th h post drug. EEG power spectral density analysis demonstrated no changes after placebo, while WE 941 and flurazepam induced statistically significant alterations characterized by an increase in beta-activity, a decrease in alpha-activity and increase in average frequency (\"anxiolytic pharmaco-EEG profile\"). In addition, 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg WE 941 and 30 mg flurazepam produced a significant augmentation of delta-activity indicating hypnotic qualities. Considering spontaneous and placebo-induced alterations, evaluation of the time- and dose-effect relationship indicated that all active substances exerted a tranquilizing effect throughout 8 h, while the hypnotic properties of 0.1 mg WE 941 were minimal (up to the 4th h), those of 0.3 mg WE 941 were moderate (up to 6 h) and those of 0.5 mg WE 941 were marked (up to 8 h). The dosage equipotent to 30 mg flurazepam is 0.3 mg WE 941. Heart rate and blood pressure exhibited no relevant changes, while side effects including fatigue, drowsiness and dizziness were mostly observed after the highest dosage of WE 941.", 
    "37": "Biosynthetic intermediates between tryptophan and the anthranilate moieties of tomaymycin and sibiromycin have been suggested, based upon a combination of feeding experiments with either carbon-14-labeled substrates or competition experiments between radiolabeled tryptophan and unlabeled intermediates. In the case of sibiromycin and tomaymycin, substitution of the aromatic ring most likely takes place at the kynurenine stage. Feeding experiments with the anthramycin culture were inconclusive, most likely because of the cell impermeability.", 
    "38": "The action of certain drugs upon the urethra of clinically intact women was studied by measurement of the urethral profile. beta-adrenoreceptor stimulating and blocking agents, such as fenoterol, propanolol, as well as cholinergics, including carbachol and pyridostigmine, failed to exercise any effect on the urethral pressure profile. On the other hand, anticholinergics, such as atropine and N-butylscopolammonium-bromide, diazepam, and chlorpromazine, produced significant decrease in both maximum urethral pressure and maximum urethral closure pressure. N-butylscopolammonium-bromide and chlorpromazine also shortened the functional length of urethra. Drop of all parameters relating to the urethral pressure profile was observed to take place in response to application of succinylcholine. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, then was administered and caused further reduction of those parameters. The pressure values were elevated by ketamine. The above findings are discussed and compared to present concepts published in literature on medicamentous control of urethral function.", 
    "39": "There is evidence that cardiac arrhythmias are partially of CNS origin, and that certain drugs affect arrhythmia, both positively and negatively, through CNS action. We hypothesized and confirmed that chlordiazepoxide diminished the well-established incidence of arrhythmias (A-V blocks and nodal escapes) in five nervous pointer dogs. It is known that this drug normalizes behavior and aids in the bar-pressing performance of nervous dogs. Nervous dogs tend to have low heart rates (HRs) while normals have higher HRs. Chlordiazepoxide increased HRs in our five nervous dogs, and we postulated that HR increase would be less or none in normals. This was confirmed in a later study of five normals. A further study of eight normal dogs and eight nervous dogs essentially reproduced these findings, suggesting the possibility that the slow heart rates and the behavioral abnormality have a common basis, expected to be some CNS biochemical lesion.", 
    "40": "The paper concerns the syndrome of stereotyped behaviour in rats induced by disturbance of inhibition in both caudate nuclei under influence of tetanus toxin, penicillin, and pirotoxin injected in these nuclei. Stereotyped behaviour could be inhibited by administration of GABA into the same brain area, as well as by a systemic administration of haloperidol, diazepam, aminalon, and lithium chloride. The conclusion is made that the disturbance of GABA-egric control in the caudate nucleus is a significant pathogenetic condition of the hyperactive neostriar dofaminergic apparatus, appearing due to disinhibition. Both links compose the pathogenetic basis of the syndrome of stereotyped behaviour.", 
    "41": "In experiments on mice (put in triads and tetrads) stable domination-subordination relations (DS) of predominantly despotic type were formed. The experiments were staged in specially designed communicating populational cages. Pharmacological evidence of inertness of DS relations in small groups of mice is presented. Critical factors of DS inertness are examined. It is shown that psychotropic drugs of different classes have difficult effect on the maintainance of DS inertness. Prolonged administration of psychotropic drugs suppressing the dominant's aggression may result in DS inversion.", 
    "42": "In a retrospective study of 2618 pregnant women we examined the influence of diazepam monotherapy as well as the combination of diazepam and fenoterol on the bilirubin concentrations and Apgar scores of the newborn children. In the diazepam-treated group 17-27% of the newborns showed Apgar scores of 6 or less. In the group treated with diazepam and fenoterol, 66-68% of the newborn had Apgar scores of 6 or less. The effect of diazepam on the bilirubin levels appears to depend on the dose and duration of the diazepam treatment: low, short term diazepam doses cause a slight bilirubin increase, while higher diazepam doses cause a reduction of the bilirubin levels. Following the combination therapy of diazepam and fenoterol a significant number of the infants developed neonatal jaundice. Due to the fact that following the combination therapy the diazepam concentration of the newborns were higher than following the monotherapy, we ascribe the greater frequency of the low Apgar values and also possibly the larger bilirubin increase to the higher diazepam concentration caused by fenoterol.", 
    "43": "Clonazepam is an antiepileptic drug for which a number of analytical procedures have been presented, none of which have been subjected to comparison studies. We present two gas chromatographic (GC) methods involving distinct forms of detection for determining plasma or serum drug levels. Both methods involve simple extractions, common GC conditions, and routine data reduction. Both employ nitrazepam as an internal standard, require 1 ml of sample, and have a detection limit of 1 ng/ml. The two methods, GC-electron capture and GC-mass spectroscopy, are precise and accurate. Correlation of the two methods paired sample analysis gave a regression equation of y = 0.988x - 0.14 (n = 30, r = 0.971, p less than 0.001). We suggest that either method is a reasonable alternative for the clinical laboratory with the proper instrumentation.", 
    "44": "It is described a muscular dystony case of manganism, treated with good results in two following phases with haloperidol and diazepam and then with L-Dopa + benserazide. On the basis of clinical and laboratory results, it makes way the hypothese that the haloperidol had developed his therapeutic action with chelation mechanism.", 
    "45": "Treatment of 2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-4-dialkylamino-1H-1,5-benzodiazepines with phosphorus pentasulfide afforded 2-thio derivatives which in turn gave the corresponding methylmercapto derivatives by reaction with sodium hydride and methyl iodide. By treating these compounds with dialkylamines the formation of 2,4-bisdialkylamino-3H-1,5-benzodiazepines was achieved. Pharmacological screening of some of the products indicated that the introduction of a second dialkylamino substituent into the 1,5-benzodiazepine molecule gave the compounds CNS excitant properties, while the initial monodialkylamino derivatives containing sulfur showed a CNS depressant activity.", 
    "46": "A technique to measure the fore-and hindlimb grip strength of rats (adult and preweanling) and mice is described. the procedure utilizes inexpensive equipment, is rapid and efficient, and provides continuous level data. As a means of validating the sensitivity of the test, the effects of phenobarbital and chlordiazepoxide on the grip strength of adult Fisher strain and Sprague-Dawley derived adult rats were investigated. Dose-related decreases in fore- and hindlimb grip scores were observed in both strain of rats. The interanimal variability in this test was less in Fisher rats than in Sprague-Dawleys. The technique appears to have a great deal of potential in studies concerning the neuromotor effects of environmental and psychopharmacological agents.", 
    "47": "During the spring of 1977 a survey was taken of drug analysis results for over 17,500 urine samples from Los Angeles County probationers and over 8,500 urine samples from Los Angeles County methadone clinic enrollees to determine the frequency of diazepam (Valium) use. The probation department specimens were found to contain diazepan less frequently than the methadone clinic specimens as a group. There were, however, wide variations in use frequency between the seven methadone clinics.", 
    "48": "Four children with migraine raised some problems of differential diagnosis (cerebral circulatory disorders; structural brain diseases; or primary psychiatric disorders). Organic lesions were excluded through special investigations (EEG, CAT, Scintigraphy, Angiography etc.). Relationships between migraine and epilepsy in children were considered and the recent literature was reviewed. No agreement was reached on how to evaluate paroxysmal electroencephalograms recorded during migrainous episodes. In a child with personal and family history of migraine suffering from a sudden attack of acute headache accompanied by focal neurological deficits, migraine is the most likely diagnosis. Only if the neurological deficit fails to resolve rapidly (after a few hours), a detailed investigation is necessary (CAT etc.). A paroxysmal electroencephalogram during the attack of migraine does not imply necessarily a diagnosis of epilepsy. Children with history of migraine must be treated with specific anti-migranious drugs even if paroxysmal EEGs are recorded during the migraine attack. It must be remembered that both disorders (i.e. migraine and epilepsy) can exist in the same patient.", 
    "49": "Minaxolone, a new steroid induction agent, was administered to unpremedicated patients at three dose levels and at 0.5 mg . kg-1 to patients receiving three different premedicant regimes. The main side effects observed at induction were involuntary muscle movements but hypertonus and tremor were also seen. Respiratory complications consisted mainly of hiccough. Over the range of doses studied only the latter complication appeared to be dose-related. Premedication with diazepam and especially opiate combinations reduced the frequency and severity of excitatory effects and respiratory upset and increased the proportion of acceptable anesthesia. Marked respiratory depression and hypotension of greater than 20 mm Hg were rare even after opiate premedication.", 
    "50": "The ability of physostigmine and naloxone to reverse the loss of righting reflex (LRR) induced by diazepam was tested in mice and rats. Physostigmine was ineffective under our test conditions, but high doses of naloxone reduced the duration of LRR in both species. However, the LD50 of diazepam in mice was unaltered by 100 or 150 mg/kg of naloxone given 1 hr after LRR to model an antidotal situation. Use of a longer duration narcotic antagonist, naltrexone (172 mg/kg), in the same design likewise failed to elevate the LD50 for diazepam. These data give limited support to prior suggestions for clinical usefulness of naloxone, although not for physostigmine, in the management of intoxication caused by diazepam.", 
    "51": "A pilot study suggesting the usefulness of intravenous diazepam as an antiemetic for adult patients receiving cis-diamminedichloroplatinum is presented. Observations included 24 patients and 34 courses of therapy. Patients received diazepam and prochlorperazine, and the incidence of vomiting and subjective evaluation of nausea were compared to previous courses of therapy with prochlorperazine alone. A positive response was observed in 87% of the patients. Use of other antiemetics is briefly reviewed.", 
    "52": "The high affinity receptors or GABA present in brain interact with an endogenous thermostable inhibitor (GABA modulin) which allosterically modifies GABA binding sites. This is the type of GABA receptor that we term GABA2 receptor in comparison to GABA1 receptor which has low affinity for GABA and is not regulated by GABA modulin. The 1,4-benzodiazepines interact competitively with GABA modulin and thereby modify GABA2 receptor binding. In contrast the occupancy of GABA receptor increases the affinity of 1,4-benzodiazepine receptors for their specific agonist. The GABA modulin and both GABA receptors are located on the membranes of C6 and NB2a cells. The NB2a cell membranes also contain CL- ionophore, thus the complete receptor complex is present in the membranes of NB2a cell clone. It was proposed that the inability of clonazepam to displace 3H-diazepam from specific binding sites characterizes the nonneuronal 1,4-benzodiazepine receptor. This characterization was shown to relate to the properties of other membrane components rather than to the characteristics of the specific benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "53": "Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 342 out-patients. The patients were allocated to four groups according to premedication given. The premedication used was atropine 0.1 mg/10 kg (A), atropine 0.1 mg/10 kg and diazepam 5 mg (AD), atropine 0.1 mg/10 kg and fentanyl 0.2 mg (AF), atropine 0.1 mg/10 kg diazepam 5 mg and fentanyl 0.2 mg (ADF). Premedication was given about 30 minutes before the procedure intramuscularly; the mouth and pharynx were sprayed with 10% lidoc,ine. The patients as well as the endoscopist considered the premedication in groups A and AD to be satisfactory. From the patient's point of view there were hardly any differences between the var;ous groups, except in drowsiness, which occurred more often in groups where fentanyl had been used. From the endoscopist's point of view groups A and AD were preferred because they offered better working conditions for the procedure. The longest period of observation was required in group ADF. On the basis of these results premedication with only atropine or if desired a combination of atropine and diazepam in addition to local sprayed anaesthesia of the mouth and pharynx is sufficient, and is recommended for endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "54": "The transplacental passage of diazepam (DZ) was studied in 32 cases of vaginal breech delivery. DZ (30 mg) was injected intravenously 15--170 seconds before delivery in order to induce sleep, and general anaesthesia was maintained with N2O/O2. The concentration of DZ was measured in blood obtained from the mother, the umbilical cord and the newborn. In the majority of the infants the drug concentrations in mixed cord blood and in capillary blood at the age of 2 hours were lower than previously observed in infants with cephalic presentations delivered by forceps. The short injection-delivery (I-D) intervals in breech deliveries may limit the transfer of drug to the foetus, but cord compression and circulatory changes may also lead to reduced materno-foetal exchange of DZ.", 
    "55": "Most drugs are bound to human serum albumin (HSA) via a few high affinity binding sites and several sites of much lower affinity. There is now increasing evidence that the actual number of high affinity drug-binding sites of HSA is rather small. Thus, each of these binding sites binds several drugs of very different chemical and pharmacological properties with relative high affinity. On the other hand these drug-binding sites can in some cases be very specific and even stereoselective, as demonstrated by the stereospecific binding of drugs to some of these binding sites. The discrepancy between both observations can be explained by the conformational adaptability of the HSA-binding sites.", 
    "56": "Recent data concerning 1%, 2.4%, and 10% topical ocular phenylephrine, topical ocular local anesthetics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, diazepam, liquid high-protein diets, sodium fluoride gel, naproxen, and thiabendazole are reviewed. Clinicians are encouraged to report possible adverse drug reactions to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects, which has been moved to the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR 97201.", 
    "57": "The esterasic capacity of a series of skeletal muscles in response to three hemisuccinate ester drugs was investigated in rats and compared to that on alpha-naphthylacetate as a reference esterase substrate. Marked variations between different muscles and between given muscles of animals of different sex were observed, indicative of a complex heterogeneity in muscular expression of esterase activity.", 
    "58": "The effects of diazepam (DZ) (0.3--1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) on sleep, cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), and rectal temperature of cats were examined. The results showed that administration of DZ produced a significant increase (p = 0.02) in slow-wave sleep (SWS) with a peak occurring at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg. Further increase in doses of DZ decreased SWS. DZ administration produced no change in paradoxical sleep, rectal temperature, 5-HIAA or HVA CSF levels. Lack of correlation between various doses of DZ, and 5-HIAA or HVA concentrations in the presence of an increased percentage of SWS suggests a possible mode of DZ action mediated through a mechanism independent of monoamines. Usually monoamines are associated with normal sleep."
