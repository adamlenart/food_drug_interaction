Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral evidence and their affinities for the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site of the GABAA receptor complex were evaluated with a radioligand receptor binding assay.", 
    "1": "The main end points for sedation during endoscopy are patients' satisfaction, short duration of the procedure, and safety. During the last year, attention has focused on attempting to identify the \"ideal\" candidate for moderate sedation/analgesia and on the importance of providing the patient with appropriate information before the procedure. The increasing pressure to perform more procedures, reduce costs, and achieve shorter patient turnaround times has affected recent approaches to sedation during endoscopy, focusing attention on alternatives to pharmacological sedation such as providing relaxing music, using small-caliber endoscopes for unsedated peroral gastroscopy, and using magnetic endoscopic imaging to increase tolerance and reduce discomfort during colonoscopy. The results, however, have not been convincing. The role of benzodiazepines was discussed in some studies, highlighting the well-known effect of midazolam on postprocedural amnesia, its pharmacological profile and tolerability after intranasal spraying in healthy volunteers, and the efficacy and safety of this route of administration as an alternative to intravenous administration in diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The form of sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy that has attracted great interest over the last year is the use of intravenous propofol, either alone or with concomitant benzodiazepines or opioids. As expected in view of the drug's known pharmacological properties, the quality of sedation was better and recovery time was shorter in patients treated with propofol. However, important questions involving the narrow therapeutic range and the mode of administration of propofol (by endoscopists or nurses, or by anesthesiologists) remain open. One important aspect of sedation procedures is prevention of cardiopulmonary complications. The use of electronic monitoring techniques, with a pulse oximeter, has been recommended as a standard procedure during digestive endoscopy; however, pulse oximetry no longer reflects the normal ventilatory functions and does not detect episodes of severe CO2 retention. CO2 monitoring by transcutaneous measurement - or better, by capnography - appears to be useful, as an alternative to pulse oximetry, as a measure of hypoventilation, and for detecting potentially important abnormalities in respiratory activity in patients undergoing sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy. With regard to preparation for endoscopic procedures, several \"ideal\" formulas for bowel preparation have been presented. These include the use of sodium phosphate compounds as an alternative to polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solutions (PEG-ELS); however, the results so far have been conflicting. The best and most cost-effective bowel cleansing procedure for colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy has yet to be established.", 
    "2": "Oxycodone has become one of the most popular opioids in the United States. It is superior to morphine in oral absorption and bioavailability, and similar in terms of protein binding and lipophilicity. Gender more than age influences oxycodone elimination. Unlike morphine, oxycodone is metabolized by the cytochrome isoenzyme CYP2D6, which is severely impaired by liver dysfunction. Controlled-release (CR) oxycodone has become one of the most frequently utilized sustained-release opioids in the United States. Both its analgesic benefits and its side effects are similar to those of CR morphine. CR oxycodone is similar to morphine and other opioids in its abuse potential. Deaths attributable to oxycodone are usually associated with polysubstance abuse in which oxycodone is combined with psychostimulants, other opioids, benzodiazepines or alcohol. Oxycodone's kappa receptor binding has little role in abuse or addiction. The cost of CR oxycodone is prohibitive for most American hospices.",

Other hypnotic drugs have not been thoroughly investigated in this regard. Intubating conditions with remifentanil followed by propofol, thiopentone or etomidate are compared in this study.", 
    "4": "In a randomized, double-blind study 45 healthy males were assigned to one of three groups (n = 15). After iv atropine, remifentanil 3 microg x kg(-1) were injected over 90 sec followed by propofol 2 mg x kg(-1) (Group I), thiopentone 6 mg x kg(-1) (Group II) or etomidate 0.3 mg x kg(-1) (Group III). Ninety seconds after the administration of the hypnotic agent, laryngoscopy and intubation were attempted. Intubating conditions were assessed as excellent, good or poor on the basis of ease of ventilation, jaw relaxation, position of the vocal cords, and patient response to intubation and slow inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff.", 
    "5": "One patient in Group I, three patients in Group II and five patients in Group III could not be intubated on the first attempt. Clinically acceptable intubating conditions were observed in 93.3%, 66.7%, 40.0% of patients in Groups I, II and III, respectively. Overall conditions at intubation were significantly (P < 0.05) better, and the frequency of excellent conditions was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the propofol group compared with the thiopentone and etomidate groups. No patient was treated for hypotension or bradycardia.",

    "7": "It is well known that the anxiolytic potential of ethanol is maintained during chronic exposure. We have confirmed this using a light-dark box paradigm following chronic ethanol ingestion via a liquid diet. However, cessation from chronic ethanol exposure is known to cause severe withdrawal anxiety. These opposing effects on anxiety likely result from neuro-adaptations of neurotransmitter systems within the brain regions regulating anxiety. Recent work highlights the importance of amygdala ligand-gated chloride channels in the expression of anxiety. We have therefore examined the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on GABA(A) and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors expressed by acutely isolated adult rat lateral/basolateral amygdala neurons. Chronic ethanol exposure increased the functional expression of GABA(A) receptors in acutely isolated basolateral amygdala neurons without altering strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. Neither the acute ethanol nor benzodiazepine sensitivity of either receptor system was affected. We explored the likelihood that subunit composition might influence each receptor's response to chronic ethanol. Importantly, when expressed in a mammalian heterologous system, GABA(A) receptors composed of unique alpha subunits were differentially sensitive to acute ethanol. Likewise, the presence of the beta subunit appeared to influence the acute ethanol sensitivity of glycine receptors containing the alpha(2) subunit. Our results suggest that the facilitation of GABA(A) receptors during chronic ethanol exposure may help explain the maintenance of ethanol's anti-anxiety effects during chronic ethanol exposure. Furthermore, the subunit composition of GABA(A) and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors may ultimately influence the response of each system to chronic ethanol exposure.",

Both assay systems are point of care immunoassays, measuring phencyclidine, barbiturates, amphetamine, cocaine metabolite, methamphetamine, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, marijuana metabolite, and benzodiazepines in human urine. The performance of these two assay systems, including a cutoff verification and cross-reactivity using spiked urine specimens and accuracy using clinical urine samples, was investigated. The cutoff verification study showed that the Signify ER had 95.4% precision for all drugs tested at concentrations of 50%, 75%, 125%, 150%, and 200% of cutoffs compared to 90% precision obtained with Triage DOA Panel. Accuracy studies testing 53 negative urine samples demonstrated that both Signify ER and Triage DOA Panel have 100% specificity. Testing of 693 positive urine samples demonstrated that Signify ER and Triage DOA Panel have sensitivities of 99.8% and 99.3%, respectively, with an accuracy of 99.9% and 99.6%. A total of 527 compounds were tested for the cross-reactivity study. Eighty-seven structurally related drugs and metabolites were found to cross-react with at least one of the nine tests of the Signify ER. Four hundred forty structurally unrelated compounds that can be found in human urine were shown not to cross-react with the Signify ER. In terms of operating characteristics, the Signify ER device is simpler since only a single pipetting step is required, and reaction completed within 8 min.", 
    "9": "The present study was performed to develop a new sleep disturbance model for evaluating hypnotic potencies by placing rats on a grid suspended over water up to 1 cm under the grid surface. When rats were placed on the grid, significant increases in sleep latency and amount of wakefulness were observed compared with those of rats placed on sawdust. However, the amounts of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep of rats placed on the grid were significantly decreased compared with those of rats placed on sawdust. Four short-acting hypnotics (triazolam, zopiclone, brotizolam, lormetazepam) caused significant decreases in sleep latency, and the effects of hypnotics in rats placed on the grid were more potent than those in rats placed on sawdust. In conclusion, the present model can serve as a new sleep disturbance model and may also be useful for evaluating the sleep-inducing effects of short-acting hypnotics.", 
    "10": "The effects of a mild hypothyroidism condition on benzodiazepine (BDZ) and mu opioid receptor levels was investigated. Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: 1) hypothyroid rats (n=7), which received methimazole (60 mg/kg per day) in drinking water for four weeks, and 2) euthyroid rats (n=8), which drank only tap water. Animals were sacrificed and their brains were used for autoradiography experiments. When compared to the euthyroid group, the hypothyroid group presented reduced benzodiazepine receptor binding in medial amygdala (24%) and high mu-receptor levels in frontal (25%), sensorimotor (65%) and temporal (29%) cortices, basolateral amygdala (50%) and ventroposterior thalamic nucleus (49%). The present data suggest that alterations in BDZ and mu-receptor binding could be associated with the higher excitability observed in animals with triiodothyronine (T(3)) deficiency.", 
    "11": "Previously, we have shown that the AMPA (iGluR1-4) antagonist LY293558 attenuates the morphine-withdrawal-induced activation of locus coeruleus neurons and behavioral signs of morphine withdrawal. However, LY293558 has since been shown to also have affinity for one subtype of kainate receptor (iGluR5). In this study, we examined the effects of a selective antagonist of iGluR1-4 receptors, LY300168 (GYKI 53655), and a selective antagonist of iGluR5 receptors, LY382884, on the morphine-withdrawal-induced activation of locus coeruleus neurons and behavioral signs of morphine withdrawal. In in vivo recordings from anesthetized rats, pretreatment with LY300168 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, s.c.), but not LY382884 (at a dose known to have central effects; 100 mg/kg, s.c.) attenuated the morphine-withdrawal-induced activation of LC neurons. In unanesthetized, morphine-dependent rats, pretreatment with LY300168 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, s.c.), but not LY382884 (100 mg/kg, s.c.), suppressed the severity and occurrence of naltrexone-precipitated morphine-withdrawal signs. These results indicate iGluR1-4 (AMPA) receptors, but not iGluR5 receptors, play an important role the morphine-withdrawal-induced activation of LC neurons and a subset of behavioral signs of morphine withdrawal. In addition, selective AMPA antagonists may have therapeutic effects in man for the treatment of withdrawal from opiates and other drugs of abuse.", 
    "12": "There are numerous methods designed to monitor brain neuropathologies resulting from a wide arsenal of insults. Regardless of the cause of neuronal death, reactive glial cells always appear at and around the site of degeneration. These cells are distinguished by the exceptional abundance of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, particularly compared with surrounding neurons. Measuring the binding of specific ligands to these peripheral benzodiazepine receptors offers a unique indirect marker for reliable damage assessment in the CNS and a faithful indicator for the accompanying cognitive deficits.",

    "15": "Using automated prescription data from 11 community pharmacies, we identified single and multiple sumatriptan prescription recipients. The data were collected from May 1, 1998, to April 30, 2000. Several patient- and medication-related variables possibly associated with single recipiency of sumatriptan were analyzed. In addition, single recipients of sumatriptan were invited for an interview and asked a number of questions related to their clinical status and their experience with the medication.", 
    "16": "Four hundred ninety-five, first-time users of sumatriptan were identified during the patient selection period, of whom 38% were single recipients of sumatriptan. Of the latter, 102 patients were considered eligible for interview. Reasons for terminating treatment after only 1 prescription included: inefficacy and/or occurrence of side effects, 78% (n=79); uncertain diagnosis of migraine, 39.2% (n=40); and reduction in headache frequency, 33.3% (n=34). Almost half of the population had terminated treatment without having consulted their physician. More than half relied upon the use of over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics after having tried sumatriptan. Compared to multiple users of sumatriptan, single recipients were far less likely to have used another form of migraine treatment prior to (odds ratio, 0.35; [95% confidence interval, 019 to 0.67]) and after (odds ratio, 0.34 [95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.63]) initiating sumatriptan.

    "17": "Single use of a sumatriptan prescription reveals some issues that may impact negatively the provision of effective migraine management. These include: rapidly developing dissatisfaction with the treatment provided and a lower tendency to seek out medical care.

For severe delirium, 270 (96%) selected pharmacological therapy, of whom 180 chose haloperidol alone, 55 chose lorazepam alone, 23 chose lorazepam in combination with haloperidol, and 12 wrote in another drug. Thirty percent of the respondents made any selection of lorazepam, alone or in combination with haloperidol, for mild or severe delirium. Sixty-one percent of those selecting haloperidol for severe delirium chose a dose greater than that recommended for geriatric patients. Sex, date of graduation from medical school, clinical specialty, completion of a geriatric fellowship, or certification in geriatrics had no significant effect on responses.", 
    "24": "The common selection of lorazepam to treat delirium is troubling because benzodiazepines themselves are implicated in delirium. Selection of an initial dose of haloperidol higher than that recommended for geriatric patients by more than half of the respondents is also of concern. There is a paucity of sound clinical evidence to guide the choice of pharmacological agents for treating delirium in older hospitalized patients.", 
    "25": "Previous studies have shown that some patients are not able to tolerate colonoscopy without sedation because of low pain threshold, anxiety, colonic sensitivity and anatomical variations. Benzodiazepines are most commonly used, often in combination with pethidine. Our study compares sedation with propofol to midazolam and colonoscopy without sedation.", 
    "26": "In this study 147 patients were examined. The patients were divided into three groups: The first group included patients in whom propofol was used for sedation, the second group included patients sedated with midazolam, and the third group was comprised of patients who received no sedation.

Two of 22 patients in whom no sedation was used were found to have oxygen saturation below 90 %. The recovery time was shorter (7 min) in group 1 (propofol) than in group 2 (midazolam), in which it was found to be 20 min.",

    "29": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common medical disorder, which causes considerable morbidity and mortality. Given the chronic and symptomatic nature of the disease, the patient is often seen in the physician's office with complaints of dyspnea. However, more than 50% of COPD patients also have sleep complaints characterised by longer latency to falling asleep, more frequent arousals and awakenings, and/or generalised insomnia. Sleep disturbance tends to be more severe with advancing disease and substantially reduces the COPD patients' quality of life. In approaching the COPD patient who complains of insomnia it is important to take a complete sleep history. Having characterised the degree and duration of the problem, medical management of the underlying COPD must first optimise oxygen saturation while minimising the effects of many of the medications used for COPD. While aerosol therapies may be systemically absorbed and contribute to sleep disruption, anticholinergics, such as ipratropium bromide, are the least likely to do so and indeed have been shown to improve sleep quality in this population. Many of the traditional sedatives and hypnotics have been used in the COPD population including benzodiazepines, imidazopyridines, pyrazolopyrimidines and, less commonly, antidepressants and phenothiazines. Clinical trials support the role of numerous agents in treating insomnia in this population but do not always provide reassurance that these therapies can be used safely, particularly in the patient with severe COPD with hypercarbia. Benzodiazepines are among the most commonly employed agents, but case reports and series continue to describe adverse pulmonary events. Although the newer pyridine derivatives also have the potential to worsen pulmonary function, they appear less likely to do so. Data to date are limited with the tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines, although they appear to be very well tolerated from a respiratory point of view. Since sleep disturbances are often long-standing and associated with maladaptive behaviours towards sleep, cognitive/behavioural approaches are often useful and are more effective in the long-term than are hypnotics. When prescription of a sedative is to be made, extra caution is required for those patients at increased risk of adverse respiratory effects, such as those with advanced disease and hypercarbia in whom pharmacological therapy is often best avoided. Selection of the various options will depend upon the degree of underlying disease and the patient's specific complaints of insomnia. Finally, it is important to remember that while most hypnotics work in an acute setting, the long-term management will require an integrated approach.", 
    "30": "Drug disposition is affected during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This study investigates the dose-concentration relationship of midazolam in neonates requiring ECMO during continuous infusion into the circuit (extracorporeally; n = 10) and intravenously (n = 10). Data on hourly doses and sedation scores were collected for 120 hours. Plasma concentrations were analyzed at times 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24, and every 12 hours thereafter. Both groups were clinically similar. Mean (standard deviation) dose for all patients was 250 (185) microg/kg/h, four times greater than previously reported. Doses administered in the first 24 hours were significantly greater extracorporeally [361 (300)] compared with intravenous [258 (190) microg/kg/h, p < 0.001]. Mean (standard deviation) plasma concentrations in all patients at 24, 48, and 72 hours were 1.4 (0.9), 1.8 (1.2), and 2.6 (1.8) microg/ml, respectively. Satisfactory sedation levels were achieved in all patients. Comparison of the actual observed with predicted (simulated) midazolam concentrations suggested significant attenuation of plasma levels during the first 24 hours of ECMO. However, at 48 hours, observed concentrations exceeded those predicted, suggesting accumulation. We conclude that in the first 24 hours of ECMO, because of an expanded circulating volume and sequestration by the circuit, significantly more midazolam is required to achieve adequate sedation. Subsequently, and because of circuit saturation, maintenance doses should be reduced.", 
    "31": "Co-induction in anesthesia is very useful: synergistic effects of two inductional drugs may lower the dose regimen and the incidence of adverse effects. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare two anesthesiological techniques for short-lasting gynecological procedures in outpatient anesthesia. A total of 80 patients scheduled for surgical termination of pregnancy were randomly assigned into two equal groups--control and co-induction group. METOHDS: The first group of patients received atropine 0.5 mg i.v., alfentanil 0.5 mg i.v. and propofol as a fractionated i.v. bolus until the loss of eyelash reflex. The second group received atropin 0.5 mg, alfentanil 0.5 mg, midazolam 3 mg and propofol in the same manner as the first group. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol increments. Cardiovascular parameters, parameters of post anesthesia recovery and the adverse effects were registered.", 
    "32": "In patients receiving midazolam inductional dose of propofol was significantly lower, whereas cardiovascular parameters were not significantly different. The recovery after anesthesia was slightly longer after co-induction, but it was not of great clinical significance. The reduction of the adverse effects was found in the co-induction group.", 
    "33": "The results of the study showed that co-induction of midazolam-propofol in comparison with propofol alone for outpatient anesthesia had the following advantages: the reduction of propofol dose, better quality of anesthesia and the reduction of the adverse effects. Recovery was faster in the group that didn't receive midazolam, but it was not of great clinical significance. The conclusion is that co-induction with the combination midazolam-propofol has the advantage in outpatient procedures.", 
    "34": "The first cases of general anesthesia were already cases with awareness. Until today, case reports of patients with awareness are published. These published cases are likely to be the top of the iceberg, as most patients with postoperative recall do not inform their anesthesiologist. Incidence of awareness with recall is between 0.1 and 0.2 %. In a large multicenter-study, incidence of recall was 0.1 % without, and 0.18 % with the use of muscle relaxants. The risk is increased with decreased doses of anesthetics, e.g. in patients with hemodynamic instability (trauma cases), patients undergoing cesarean section or cardiac surgery. Intraoperative awareness does not necessarily cause explicit (conscious) memory. Even in the absence of explicit memory, implicit (unconscious) memory can still have consequences for the patient. In the worst case, it can cause post-traumatic stress disorder. There is doubt whether patients may profit from positive suggestions given during intraoperative awareness. Recommendations to administer benzodiazepines to prevent explicit memory must be reconsidered. Complete neuromuscular block should be avoided whenever possible. If a patient is thought to be aware, he should be contacted, his situation should be explained and affirming comments should be given until consciousness is lost again. Postoperative visit should include questions about awareness and recall. The anesthetist should not disbelieve reported recall. Explanation of what had happened and referral to an experienced psychologist must be offered. Thus, the incidence of severe sequelae should decrease.",

Chronic bacterial prostatitis is uncommon, chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CPPS) is extremely common. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in management of chronic bacterial prostatitis and inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

However, the technique may miss the epileptogenic region and FDG PET abnormalities may extend beyond the seizure onset zone. Consequently, for the precise identification of epileptogenic regions more specific imaging probes than FDG are warranted.

    "43": "The isometric tension of circular distal esophageal muscle strips from Japanese White rabbits was examined. NANC relaxation was induced by KCl (30 mm) in the presence of atropine (3 x 10(-6) m) and guanethidine (3 x 10(-6) m).

Ketamine concentration-dependently inhibited the relaxation induced by N-ethylethanamine:1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine (diethylamine NONOate) and S-nitrosoglutathione. The NANC relaxation itself was not affected by superoxide dismutase. The midazolam-induced inhibition of the NANC relaxation was reversed neither by superoxide dismutase nor by catalase, and midazolam did not affect the relaxations induced by nitric oxide donors. The nitric oxide synthase activity was concentration-dependently suppressed by midazolam, but there was no marked effect of ketamine. Pyrogallol, a superoxide generator, inhibited the NANC and the diethylamine NONOate-induced relaxations. The pyrogallol-induced inhibition of the NANC relaxation was reversed by superoxide dismutase.",

    "46": "Reduced auditory P300 amplitude generally has been considered to be a trait marker of schizophrenia, independent of antipsychotic treatment and clinical symptoms. However, several seemingly well-conducted studies have found P300 amplitude to be a state marker correlated with clinical symptoms. Recent research on atypical antipsychotics indicate that these medications may alter P300 amplitude as well as having beneficial clinical effects. The objective of the present study was to further elucidate the effects of schizophrenia, symptom severity, and medication status on the P300. The baseline auditory P300 was assessed in unmedicated schizophrenic patients who then were treated with olanzapine for 6 weeks and reassessed. Healthy control subjects were assessed at baseline and again at 6 weeks. Compared to healthy controls, the unmedicated patients' P300s were attenuated and delayed prior to treatment. Subsequent antipsychotic treatment increased the patients' P300 amplitudes without affecting latency. Frontal P300 amplitude was normalized, but parietal P300 amplitude remained below that of healthy controls. Although olanzapine was effective in reducing the patients' symptoms, there were no correlations between symptoms and P300 amplitude or latency either before or after treatment. The results of the present study lend support to the view that P300 amplitude behaves as a trait marker. No evidence is found of a P300 clinical state marker.", 
    "47": "Place conditioning (PC) experiments were conducted as a means to further elaborate the treatment potential of the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine (OLZ), for stimulant abuse. The resulting preference/aversion provides an indirect measure of the incentive salience (i.e., euphoria/dysphoria) produced by a drug. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=48) were conditioned in two unique environments (i.e., vertical vs. horizontal stripped walls, large vs. small grid flooring) using injections (1.0 mg/kg ip) of either amphetamine (AMPH) or saline (SAL). On average, animals displayed a significant preference for the AMPH-paired location after 2.5 weeks of conditioning (five pairings each of AMPH and SAL). Once the preference was established, animals were pretreated (60 min) with a single dose of OLZ (0.0, 0.56, 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg sc) given on the test (AMPH-free) day. For the following week's test, animals were injected with SAL (1.0 mg/kg ip) in an attempt to recapture the side preference exhibited before OLZ treatment. OLZ treatment prevented the expression of the AMPH-conditioned preference and reduced locomotor activity. Inhibition of preference resulted from the highest dose of OLZ (1.5 mg/kg), while the inhibition of locomotor activity occurred across all three doses. Additionally, while the effects on preference were no longer apparent by the SAL test the following week (reversible), the activity was still depressed during the SAL tests in animals that had experienced the highest dose of OLZ (1.5 mg/kg). Control experiments, in which OLZ was used as the conditioning drug, suggest that OLZ itself possesses no aversive effects in the PC paradigm, and may even produce a preference for the drug-paired chamber. Because the AMPH preference is dependent on dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), these experiments suggest that OLZ pretreatment interferes with the rewarding, as well as the subjective effects of AMPH.",

    "50": "Forty six children admitted with febrile seizures were orally administered with 0.25 mg/kg/dose of diazepam six hourly for four doses. Trough (prior to the next dose) and peak (at 1 hour 20 minutes after the dose) serum levels of diazepam were analyzed. The patients were observed for adverse effects of the medication.", 
    "51": "The peak levels after 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th doses were above 0.15 microg/ml which is considered the therapeutic level in 93.5, 97.8, 97.7, and 100 per cent of the patients, respectively. The trough levels prior to the 2nd, 3nd, and 4th doses were greater than 0.15 microg/ml in 75.0, 84.0, and 91.3 per cent, respectively. Neither recurrent seizure nor serious adverse effects occurred in any of the patients.", 
    "52": "Serum concentrations above the therapeutic level were achieved after orally administered diazepam at 0.25 mg/kg/dose six hourly for four doses. Oral diazepam may be used as another method in the prevention of recurrent febrile seizures.", 
    "53": "This experimental study was designed to investigate whether midazolam has antioxidant effects in reperfused rat kidneys following ischemia. Twenty Wistar Albino rats were included in the study. Rats were anesthetized with the mixture of ketamine 90 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally. Following anesthesia, the rats were divided into two groups. The first group was considered as the control group, whereas the second group received additional midazolam 3.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally. The left kidney was approached via a transabdominal incision and the left renal artery was dissected. Left renal ischemia was created by clamping the left renal artery for 45 minutes. Following the ischemia period, the kidney was reperfused for one hour. Both kidneys were then removed. Half of the left kidneys were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen for transportation and then frozen at -70 C until measurements of tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels. The remaining halves of the left kidneys and right kidneys were fixed in 10% formalin. The changes which developed during the ischemia-reperfusion period in the left kidney were investigated by histopathological examination and compared with those of the normal contralateral kidney. When compared with the control group, tissue MDA and GSH levels were similar in the midazolam group (p > 0.05). Tubular damage with tubulitis and focal interstitial inflammatory infiltration were observed in histopathological examinations of reperfused left kidneys of the control group. There was PMNL infiltration only in perirenal fat tissue of the midazolam group. Right kidneys were histopathologically normal in both groups. We concluded that within this dosage midazolam does not have any antioxidant effect in reperfused rat kidneys following ischemia.", 
    "54": "The Bispectral Index Monitor has been validated as an objective measure of sedation depth in the operating room; however, its value for states other than general anesthesia remains unclear. We hypothesized that bispectral index monitoring would reliably correlate with traditional definitions of sedation depth in emergency department patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia.", 
    "55": "In this prospective observational study we measured the Bispectral Index score and a modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score every 5 minutes in a convenience sample of adult ED patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia. Investigators and treating physicians were blinded to Bispectral Index scores, which were later correlated with modified Ramsay Sedation Scale scores. We constructed receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the most discriminatory Bispectral Index score thresholds for sedation depth.", 
    "56": "Two hundred seventy paired readings were obtained from 37 patients. Despite being statistically significant (P <.0005), the correlation between the Bispectral Index Monitor and modified Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was only moderate (Spearman rho=-0.690) and displayed wide variability. A modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score consistent with mild-to-moderate sedation corresponded to Bispectral Index scores of 34 (general anesthesia) to 98 (fully awake), whereas a modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score consistent with deep sedation corresponded to Bispectral Index scores of 40 to 98. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated moderate (0.83 to 0.86) discriminatory power at all modified Ramsay Sedation Scale thresholds, with the exception of a modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score of 7 or less, which demonstrated high discriminatory power (0.95). A Bispectral Index score of greater than 83 reliably excluded general anesthesia, and a Bispectral Index score of 70 or less reliably identified general anesthesia.", 
    "57": "Bispectral index monitoring reliably predicted patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia who were sedated to the point of general anesthesia from those with lesser degrees of sedation but did not discriminate mild-to-moderate sedation or moderate-to-deep sedation, as measured by the Ramsay Sedation Scale score for the patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia in our ED.", 
    "58": "Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data for the antipsychotic drug olanzapine were investigated with respect to concentration versus dose relationship, intraindividual versus interindividual variability, and the combined influence of patient characteristics on steady-state concentration. The study included 250 patients, with daily doses ranging from 2.5 to 30 mg. Median concentration to dose ratio was 2.1 (ng/mL)/(mg/d), with 90% of the distribution in a fivefold range. In the first subgroup of patients with two measurements at different doses (n = 21), data were in keeping with linear concentration versus dose relationship. In the second subgroup of patients with repeated measurements at a constant daily dose (n = 40), estimates of within-patient and between-patient variabilities were 30.5% and 49.4%, respectively. In the whole sample, multiple regression analysis of dose-normalized concentration revealed significant effects of time postdose (-18% per 12 hours delay, P < 0.05), age >/=60 years (+27%, P < 0.005), cigarette smoking (-12%, P < 0.05), and comedication with fluvoxamine (+74%, P < 0.001), paroxetine, fluoxetine, or sertraline (considered together, +32%, P < 0.05), venlafaxine (+27%, P < 0.05), and inducers of P450 enzymes (-40%, P < 0.001). The final model included a tendency for higher concentration associated with female gender (+11%, P = 0.07) and accounted for 27% of observed interindividual variability. When considering a worst-case scenario, an elderly, nonsmoking woman prescribed fluvoxamine comedication was predicted to reach a 4.6-fold higher olanzapine concentration than a young male smoker coadministered carbamazepine. The current study suggests that patients characterized by a combination of factors associated with altered metabolism may benefit from olanzapine TDM.", 
    "59": "The synthesis and pharmacological characterisation of (S)-CPW 399 as a novel, potent and subtype-selective agonist of the AMPA receptor was recently reported. Studies have been extended to investigate its excitotoxic action in primary cultures of mouse cerebellar granule cells. (S)-CPW 399 induced neuronal cell death in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) approximately 70 microM) at 24-h exposure. (S)-CPW-induced neuronal death could be prevented by co-administration with either of the AMPA/kainate selective receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) or by the 2,3-benzodiazepine, GYKI 53655 (a selective AMPA receptor antagonist); while no protection was afforded by either the NMDA receptor antagonist D,L(+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (APV) or by nifedipine (an L-type calcium channel antagonist) when used alone or in combination. Cyclothiazide, which blocks AMPA receptor desensitisation, caused minimal potentiation of (S)-CPW 399-induced neuronal death, supporting accumulating evidence that (S)-CPW 399 is a full AMPA receptor agonist that markedly prevents a receptor desensitised conformation. (S)-AMPA, (S)-willardiine (a naturally-occurring heterocyclic excitatory amino acid) and its halogenated derivative, (S)-5-fluorowillardiine, had no deleterious effect on neuronal viability when used alone but each, in the presence of cyclothiazide, induced a concentration-dependent excitotoxic cell death with a rank order of potency (fluorowillardiine>AMPA=willardiine). (S)-CPW 399 stimulated an increase in intracellular free-calcium levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in a concentration-dependent fashion (EC(50) approximately 5 microM) attaining a value of six-fold that of 'resting' cells at maximum stimulation; achieved at approximately 100 microM (S)-CPW 399. The (S)-CPW 399-stimulated increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was virtually abolished by GYKI 53655, NBQX, CNQX and by cobalt ions; markedly inhibited by nifedipine and marginally affected by D-APV. These results suggest that (S)-CPW 399 may be used as a pharmacological tool to aid in the investigation of the role of AMPA receptors in excitotoxicity and their molecular mechanisms of desensitisation.", 
    "60": "The aim of this study was to investigate the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in soft tissue membranes of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from both polluted and nonpolluted seawater populations, using a radioligand specific for this receptor, [3H]PK11195. Mussels were dissected into four body parts--mantle, gills, digestive gland, and muscles-to determine the distribution of tissue-specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs). The specific binding was saturable and reversible. A statistically significant increase (muscle, 537% and mantle, 201%, as absolute percentages) in the maximal number of binding sites (B(max)) was found in mussels from the polluted site, compared with mussels from the nonpolluted site. By contrast, the value of the dissociation constant (K(d)) at equilibrium does not show a statistically significant variation between the two groups. In competitive experiments of the compounds clonazepam, flumazenil, flunitrazepam, Ro5-4864, PK11195, and protoporphyrin IX, only PK11195 and protoporphyrin IX displaced [3H]PK11195 specifically bound to soft tissue membranes, revealing that the binding sites of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors of mussels have pharmacological properties comparable to those of low vertebrates such as trout. M. galloprovincialis was also tested as an indicator of heavy metal exposure, and metal accumulation in the digestive gland was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The contents of Pb, Mn, and Zn in mussels collected off the polluted site were higher than those in mussels from the nonpolluted site. These data suggest that PBRs are present in the soft tissues of the mussel M. galloprovincialis. Here we report preliminary evidence of biochemical alterations in mussels from the polluted site.", 
    "61": "The first choice group of psychotropic agents in schizophrenia is neuroleptics. However, this treatment is not effective in all patients and with every symptom. We summarize papers published on the role of antiepileptic drugs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We have searched the computer database system MEDLINE for relevant articles including reviews, reports of drug studies and case histories. Antiepileptic drugs can change symptoms of schizophrenia by their action on GABA-ergic neurotransmission or via anti-glutamatergic mechanisms. High doses of adjunctive benzodiazepines reduce positive symptoms, anxiety, and agitation. Carbamazepine is effective in affective symptoms of schizophrenia and influences violent behavior in psychotic patients. Its anti-kindling action may represent a promising treatment strategy for some patients with chronic course of schizophrenia. Valproate treatment leads to a decrease in positive symptoms as well as hostility. Lamotrigine is expected to influence the positive, negative, affective, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. New antiepileptics (e.g., gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, vigabatrin) present a promise as potential adjuncts to neuroleptic treatment in resistant symptoms of schizophrenia.",

    "63": "Thirty-nine out-patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with depressive symptoms, both with (n=23) and without (n=16) syndromal major depression (MD) participated in an 11-week clinical trial. Approximately 18 months after initial screening, these individuals were once again evaluated using a structured diagnostic interview and a battery of rating scales.", 
    "64": "Three distinct groups were discernible at follow-up. Twenty-three (60%) of the patients remained syndromal for GAD; 10 patients (43%) were in partial remission from GAD; six (15%) were asymptomatic. Of the 23 patients who were syndromal for MD at baseline, 13 (56%) remained syndromal for MD at follow-up. All of the patients who were syndromal for MD at follow-up remained syndromal for GAD as well.", 
    "65": "Outcomes in this study were quite divergent, though they support the concept of GAD as a chronic illness in most patients, with or without MD. The presence or absence of MD versus subsyndromal depression at baseline appeared to have relatively little impact upon the outcome. Patients with subsyndromal anxiety and depressive symptoms may be at special risk for syndromal disorders over time.", 
    "66": "Recent studies using human breast cancer cell lines, animal models, and human tissue biopsies have suggested a close correlation between the expression of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and the progression of breast cancer. This study investigates the genetic status of the PBR gene in two human breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-231 cells, which are an aggressive breast cancer cell line that contains high levels of PBR, and MCF-7 cells, which are a nonaggressive cell line that contains low levels of PBR. Both DNA (Southern) blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the PBR gene is amplified in MDA-MB-231 relative to MCF-7 cells. These data suggest that PBR gene amplification may be an important indicator of breast cancer progression.", 
    "67": "4D-QSAR analysis was applied to a training set of 38 flavonoids where affinity constants, Ki, to the GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptor site, BzR, were determined. It was found that the -logKi values of the compounds are highly dependent on the size and electrostatics character of the substituents at the R(3') and R(6) positions of the flavonoid scaffold. Polar negative groups correctly embedded in the R(3') and/or R(6) substituents are predicted to increase -logKi values. A planar conformation of the flavonoid scaffold was found not to be a requirement for the flavonoids to be active. A test set of four compounds was used to evaluate the predictivity of the 4D-QSAR models.", 
    "68": "A method to assay lorazepam in human urine has been developed. After addition of hydroxyethylflurazepam (internal standard) and hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase, the lorazepam and hydroxyethylflurazepam were extracted with ethyl ether at pH 10.8. The analysis was performed on an HP-5 capillary column with nitrogen-phosphorus detector(NPD). The detection limit and recovery of analytes in urine were 5 micrograms/L and (83.4 +/- 3.1)% respectively. The method was successfully applied to urine specimens collected from healthy human volunteers who have ingested 2 mg of lorazepam. The method was sensitive enough to assay urine specimen excreted at 32 h after taking the medicine by volunteers.", 
    "69": "Chronic treatment with benzodiazepines induces tolerance to most of their pharmacological effects. The best-studied neurochemical correlation to this phenomenon involves GABAergic adaptive changes. However, some compensation by excitatory neurotransmission could also be postulated.", 
    "70": "The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of chronic treatment with benzodiazepines on several parameters of hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission.", 
    "71": "Rats were injected (IP) with a single dose or daily doses (21 days) of 1 mg/kg lorazepam (LZ) or vehicle. Thirty minutes after the last dose, animals were killed and parameters were measured in the dissected hippocampi. We determined one presynaptic parameter, in vitro glutamate release induced by a 60 mM K(+) stimulus. [(3)H]MK-801 binding to postsynaptic NMDA receptors and the NMDA-stimulated efflux of cGMP were also evaluated.", 
    "72": "While no changes were observed in any of the parameters after a single dose of the drug, we found an increase of 206% in in vitro glutamate release in chronically treated animals [two-way ANOVA: F(1,16)=6.22], together with an increment of 103% in the NMDA-stimulated cGMP efflux [two-way ANOVA: F(1,18)=14.05]. No changes either in K(D) or in B(max) values for [(3)H]MK-801 binding to hippocampal membranes were observed.", 
    "73": "Taken together, these changes strongly suggest that a compensatory increase in the glutamatergic response develops in the hippocampus during chronic treatment with LZ. Our findings might indicate a contribution of glutamatergic mechanisms to the tolerance to hippocampal-mediated effects of LZ, such as amnesic and anticonvulsant activities.", 
    "74": "Ketamine and midazolam are commonly used in children undergoing cardiac catheterization. However, there is controversy regarding the safety of administering these agents in the absence of an anesthesiologist. We retrospectively reviewed pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures at our institution between 1996 and 1997. A total of 154 patients (0.3-192 months) underwent a total of 205 procedures. They received ketamine (n = 79, 1.05 +/- 0.88 mg/kg/hr), midazolam (n = 35, 0.14 +/- 0.09 mg/kg/hr), or both (n = 91; ketamine, 1.13 +/- 0.84 mg/kg/hr; midazolam, 1.57 +/- 1.03 mg/kg//hr). In 18.5% of patients there were complex cardiac lesions. Mean procedure time was 79 +/- 36.2 minutes. Pre- and postprocedure systolic and diastolic mean blood procedure 72 +/- 14 and 68 +/- 12 mmHg, respectively. Pre- and postprocedure O2 saturation was 93.19 +/- 8.72 and 93.63 +/- 8.3, respectively. One patient required intubation, and 15% required oxygen therapy. The mortality rate was zero. The anesthesiologist's assistance was requested by the cardiologist in 21 procedures (group A) and not requested in 184 procedures (group B). The two groups were not different in relation to the drug used (p = 0.283) or the complexity of the cardiac lesions (p = 0.051). However, there was significant difference between the two regarding the need for supporting drugs (3/21 vs 3/184, p = 0.02) or oxygen treatment (7/21 vs 26/184, p = 0.014). No patients in group B required intubation, whereas 14% and 1.6% required oxygen therapy and supporting drugs, respectively. We conclude that low-dose ketamine and midazolam can be administered safely to most pediatric patients by the cardiologist, who can safely predict the need for an anesthesiologist.", 
    "75": "Many drugs are cosubstrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and MDR1; furthermore, their disposition is markedly affected by pretreatment with inducing agents, including St John's wort. Such drug interactions reflect induction of both proteins through a common mechanism involving the steroid X receptor/pregnane X receptor. However, the relative contributions of enhanced metabolism and efflux transport to the overall induction process are unknown.", 
    "76": "The effects of 12 days' pretreatment with St John's wort on the disposition of selected in vivo probe drugs were determined in 21 young healthy subjects. Midazolam after oral and intravenous administration was used to assess CYP3A activity in both the intestinal epithelium and the liver, whereas the disposition of fexofenadine after an oral dose was assumed to be a measure of MDR1 function, and the oral plasma concentration-time profile of cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) was considered to reflect both CYP3A and MDR1 activities.", 
    "77": "St John's wort markedly affected the plasma concentration-time profiles of all of the drugs, with associated increases in their clearance. With midazolam, the enhancement was considerably less after intravenous administration (approximately 1.5-fold) than after oral administration (approximately 2.7-fold), and estimated intestinal and hepatic extraction ratios were higher by approximately 1.2- to 1.4-fold. By contrast, the oral clearances of fexofenadine and cyclosporine were equally increased by approximately 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively; these changes were both statistically less than for midazolam's oral clearance and greater than its estimated intestinal extraction.", 
    "78": "Although the disposition of all 3 drugs was altered by St John's wort, the extent of induction measured by oral clearance was different with CYP3A activity (midazolam), apparently increasing more than MDR1 function (fexofenadine), whereas with cyclosporine the change in oral clearance appeared to be more closely associated with the increase in MDR1 rather than CYP3A, despite the fact that both proteins are importantly involved in its disposition. These discordances indicate that, although a common molecular mechanism may be involved, the quantitative aspects of induction are complex and depend on the particular drug and the relative contributions of CYP3A and MDR1 in its disposition.", 
    "79": "Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, was evaluated in anxious patients prior to oral surgery. This population represents a possible acute screening model for novel anxiolytic agents. Healthy subjects, preselected for a moderate to high degree of dental anxiety based upon Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale, were enrolled in a three-arm parallel design study and randomly assigned to receive double-blind placebo (N=15), alprazolam 0.25 mg (N=16) or alprazolam 1 mg (N=16). Subjective self-reported anxiety was rated using the State Anxiety Inventory and visual analog scales. Objective measures included galvanic skin conductance, heart rate variability, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration. At 90 minutes after dosing, there were statistically significant (p<0.05) reductions compared with placebo in subjective anxiety and skin conductance mean level for the alprazolam-treated subjects. Changes from pre-dose (mean +/- SEM) at 90 minutes in the placebo, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and alprazolam 1 mg groups were -4.73 +/- 2.79, -13.75 +/- 2.49, and -12.81 +/- 2.32 for the State Anxiety Inventory and 5.44 +/- 6.71, -31.88 +/- 5.88, and -32.34 +/- 5.32 mm for analog anxiety scores. Corresponding skin conductance mean level at 100 minutes in the three groups (respectively) changed 0.64 +/- 0.24, -0.53 +/- 0.21, -0.71 +/- 0.22 microSiemens. The 0.25 mg and 1 mg dosages of alprazolam were not differentiated. Changes in heart rate variability, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration did not reflect subjective anxiety. Overall, the oral surgery anticipation anxiety model was found to be a sensitive test for benzodiazepine anxiolytic activity and may represent a potential screening model for evaluation of investigational agents.",

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) were administered as outcome measures. Extrapyramidal side effects were assessed at each visit. Olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg/day and could be increased to a maximum total daily dose of 20 mg.", 
    "82": "Sixteen participants with a mean age of 13.8 (SD = 1.5) years were treated. Significant improvements were found in the PANSS, CGI severity, and CGAS scores. Reductions in both positive and negative symptoms were found. Increased appetite and sedation were the most frequently reported side effects. Two subjects required treatment for extrapyramidal side effects.", 
    "83": "Psychotic symptoms significantly improved during study. Overall, olanzapine was well tolerated. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, to assess long-term treatment outcomes, and to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine with that of other antipsychotics.", 
    "84": "Dynamic chromatographic methods constitute a versatile approach to the rapid and precise determination of enantiomerization barriers of stereolabile drugs. In the present study enantioselective dynamic high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was employed to determine the enantiomerization barrier of oxazepam. Dynamic elution profiles, exhibiting plateau formation and/or peak broadening between 20 and 60 degrees C at pH 2.6 and pH 8 were obtained in the presence of the chiral stationary phase (CSP) Nucleodex-beta-PM (permethylated beta-cyclodextrin chemically bonded to silica) using a 6:4 mixture of phosphate buffer and methanol as mobile phase. Evaluation of the experimental chromatograms was performed by the novel approximation function (AF) (without computer simulation), and by the stochastic model implemented in the ChromWin simulation software (with computer simulation) furnishing the respective apparent forward rate constants, k(1)(app)(T). From the rate constants, k(1)(app)(T), measured at variable temperatures, the kinetic Eyring activation parameters, deltaG(T)(#), deltaH(#) and deltaS(#), of the enantiomerization of oxazepam were obtained. By variation of the flow rate of the mobile phase, the expected independence of the enantiomerization barrier from the chromatographic time scale was demonstrated for the first time.", 
    "85": "The enantioselective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of three racemic 3-hydroxybenzodiazepines, oxazepam (Oxa), lorazepam (Lor), and temazepam (Tem), is a difficult operation because of the spontaneous chiral inversion in polar solvent. To solve this problem, we have developed an HPLC method based on a chiral Cyclobond I-2000 RSP column, maintained at 12 degrees C, and a reversed mobile phase (acetonitrile in 1% triethylamine acetate buffer, TEAA) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Peaks were detected by a photodiode-array detector at 230 nm for quantification and by an optical rotation detector for identification of (+) and (-) enantiomers. The results showed that peak resolutions of Oxa, Lor, and Tem enantiomers, analyzed under the same conditions, were 3.2, 2.0, and 1.8, respectively. For the determination of Oxa enantiomers in plasma of rabbits, extraction with diethyl ether at pH 1.5, a polar organic mobile phase, and a Cyclobond I-2000 SP column were used. Other analytical conditions were the same as previously described. Blood samples were immediately cooled at 4 degrees C and centrifuged at 0 degrees C for the collection of plasma. The results showed a difference in plasma S(+)- and R(-)-oxazepam concentrations in rabbits. No racemization of S(+)- or R(-)-Oxa enantiomers, added alone to blank plasma, was observed after extraction and enantioselective HPLC analysis.", 
    "86": "Stereoselective binding of benzodiazepine and coumarin drugs to serum albumin from human and six mammalian species were studied by chiral chromatographic techniques. The applied methods were affinity chromatography on the albumins immobilized on Sepharose 4B, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation on columns based on human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), and chiral HPLC analysis of ultrafiltrates of solutions containing the racemic drug and the native protein. Substantial differences in preferred configurations and conformations were detected among the species. The binding stereoselectivity of the 2,3-benzodiazepine drug, tofisopam, in human, is opposite to that in all other species. In the binding of 1,4-benzodiazepines, dog albumin is very similar to HSA. Highly preferred binding of (S)-phenprocoumon was found with dog albumin.", 
    "87": "The food competition interaction test performed with food-restricted pigeons with previously consolidated dominance is a useful tool for the study of offensive and defensive social aggression. In the present study, we examined the effect of GABA-A-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor manipulation on aggression, emotion, feeder control, and eating behavior in high- and low-aggression female pigeons maintained at 80% of their normal weight and exposed to food competition interactions. The pigeons were divided into pairs by previously ranked high-aggression females (total time spent in aggression over 60 s/5 min; n=6 pairs) and low-aggression females (time spent in aggression less than 10 s/5 min; n=6 pairs). In Experiment 1, a pigeon in each pair of high- and low-aggression subjects were treated daily with an oral dose of diazepam (DZP, 0.6 mg/kg/0.3 ml) for 8 days. The other animal received the vehicle. On Day 8, food competition trials (10 min) were performed 30 min after treatments. In Experiment 2, pigeons were injected subcutaneously with flumazenil (FZL, 0.1 mg/kg/1 ml) or saline and exposed to a food competition trial 30 min after injections. In Experiment 3, one animal in each pair received DZP for 8 days. The other animal received the vehicle. On Day 8, the DZP-treated subjects were injected subcutaneously with FZL (0.1 mg/ kg/1 ml) 30 min before the oral dose of DZP. Trials were performed 30 min after DZP or vehicle administration. In Experiment 1, it was found that the DZP group of high-aggression pigeons showed lower scores of aggression (P<.05) and emotional responses (P<.05) than controls. The other group-scored behaviors were not affected. The DZP low-aggressions, however, showed scores of aggression eightfold higher than their controls (P<.05) but the other scored behaviors were not changed. In Experiment 2, FZL injection did not induce intrinsic effects on aggression either in the high- or in the low-aggression group. Experiment 3 showed that the emotional and aggressive responses to DZP were neutralized by FZL. This shows that GABA-A-BZD receptor mechanisms are implicated in the DZP responses in high- and low-aggression pigeons.",

In particular, compounds were evaluated against audiogenic seizure in DBA/2 mice, maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test and various chemoconvulsant models; both groups showed a protective action against audiogenic seizure, MES- and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. All 2,3-benzodiazepines were also protective against clonic and tonic seizures and lethality induced by 4-aminopyridine, kainate, AMPA and 3-mercaptopropionic acid but were ineffective against NMDA-induced seizures. NBQX was unable to affect 4-aminopyridine-, mercaptopropionic acid- and NMDA-induced seizures. The duration of anticonvulsant action of 33 micromol/kg of some 2,3-benzodiazepine in DBA/2 mice, genetically susceptible to audiogenic seizures, was also investigated. The derivatives possessing a thiocarbonyl group at the C-4 position of heptatomic ring showed higher anticonvulsant activities and longer lasting protective effects. We conclude that all 2,3-benzodiazepines studied are effective against various models of experimental epilepsy and the presence of thiocarbonyl groups at the C-4 position of heptatomic ring is able to increase the anticonvulsant effect of these compounds.", 
    "89": "The present investigation assessed whether hypnotic activity of melatonin was mediated by the GABA(A) receptor in rats. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured in this experiment. Melatonin, at a dose of 10 mg/kg ip, showed a significant sleep-promoting effect in rats. Flumazenil (3.5 and 7 mg/kg), a specific antagonist of the benzodiazepine (BZP) recognition site on the GABA(A) receptor, and picrotoxin (2 and 4 mg/kg), the ligand of the picrotoxin site on the GABA(A) receptor, seemed to be devoid of intrinsic influence on each sleep parameter when used alone, but they significantly antagonized the melatonin-induced increase in total sleep time (TS), slow-wave sleep time (SWS) and paradoxical sleep time (PS), and the decrease in time to sleep onset (TSO) and wakefulness time (W). A significant interaction was shown between melatonin and flumazenil or picrotoxin. When bicuculline methiodide (2 and 4 mg/kg), a specific antagonist of the GABA binding site on the GABA(A) receptor, was used together with melatonin, the melatonin-induced increase in TS, SWS and PS, and the decrease in W were abolished. However, there was no interaction between melatonin and bicuculline methiodide on sleep parameters except PS. These results indicate that the hypnotic activity of melatonin may be linked to the GABA(A) receptor and mediated through the BZP recognition site, the picrotoxin site on the GABA(A) receptor and partially through the GABA binding site on the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "90": "This study investigated the impact of benzodiazepine receptor agonist, midazolam and antagonist, flumazenil, on the rat frontal cortex slices oxygen consumption (QO(2)), in presence and absence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). QO(2) was polarographically determined, using the biological oxygen monitor. As it was previously shown, GABA on its own decreases QO(2) moderately. Midazolam decreased QO(2) at 1.0mg/kg, whereas flumazenil had no effect. In combination with per se ineffective GABA (10(-6)mol/l), flumazenil showed respiratory depressant action, presumably revealing partial agonistic activity at some of GABA(A) receptor subtypes. However, it completely antagonized effects of midazolam on QO(2), on its own and in presence of GABA. Our results show that in vivo well-established effects of midazolam on cerebral metabolic activity could be reproduced in in vitro settings. Moreover, flumazenil antagonized this action, indicating the role of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex activation in QO(2) regulation.", 
    "91": "A rapid and highly sensitive method, based on high performance thin-layer chromatography, is described for the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, the main metabolite of flunitrazepam in human urine. 7-Aminoflunitrazepam in specimen was extracted by solid phase extraction using GDX-403 porous polymer bead as sorbent and ethyl ether as eluant. Fluorescamine was used as a reagent to produce fluorescent product on the plate. The limit of detection was 5 micrograms/L and the limit of quantitation was 15 micrograms/L for 7-aminoflunitrazepam in urine. The method can be successfully used for measuring 7-aminoflunitrazepam in urine samples of the subjects excreted over a 48 h period after receiving 1 mg flunitrazepam orally. The method is applicable to drug examination for the cases of drug-facilitated robbery and rape.", 
    "92": "Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic drug. Recently it has been applied to clinical research. For the determination of olanzapine in plasma a reversed-phase HPLC method has been established. An aqueous solution of 0.25% ascorbic acid was added into the plasma sample and kept at -20 degrees C. Olanzapine can be separated on a Zorbax ODS column with a mobile phase of 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate (pH 7.2)-methanol-acetonitrile(12:10:3, volume ratios) and detected at 270 nm. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The linear range was 15 micrograms/L-1,200 micrograms/L, r = 0.9988. The limited concentration of detection was 3 micrograms/L. The average recovery was (97.02 +/- 3.11)%. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were 3.86% (n = 15) and 4.12% (n = 15) respectively. The method has been used to determine olanzapine concentration in patient's plasma. The data obtained show that the sensitivity and selectivity of this method are adequate for drug monitoring in clinical research.", 
    "93": "In order to analyze clozapine, N-desmethyl clozapine and olanzapine, their detection characteristics with high performance liquid chromatograph-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) were investigated. The separation was performed on an ODS-3 column with the mobile phase of methanol and 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer(60:40, V/V). The retention times of clozapine, N-desmethyl clozapine and olanzapine were all prolonged with higher pH of the mobile phase. These three compounds could be separated on the baseline at pH 4.56 and 5.56. The relationships of peak heights and detection voltages shown typical \"S\" shaped curves, and these curves shifted to the left with higher pH. To get stable detection current, the detection voltages for clozapine, N-desmethyl clozapine and olanzapine must be higher than 0.60 V, 0.60 V and 0.35 V at pH 4.56, and 0.48 V, 0.48 V and 0.30 V at pH 5.56, respectively. The typical \"S\" shaped ampere-volt curves were very important for the selection of suitable voltage for quantitative detection, and could be used for the qualitative detection of these three compounds.",

One is the hyphenated techniques between many spectroscopic methods such as mass (MS), infrared (FT-IR) and atomic emission (ICP), and micro-LC. The other one is rather difficult, but basic and theoretical approach which deals with retention mechanism in LC.

    "95": "The authors explored the binge eating symptomatology in 74 patients receiving clozapine (N = 57) or olanzapine (N = 17), and compared body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) and weight gain in patients with and without binge eating symptomatology. Subjects who screened positively for binge eating were interviewed using a modified version of the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns (QEWP). Current BMIs were assessed cross-sectionally, BMIs at initiation of clozapine/olanzapine treatment retrospectively. Thirty-seven subjects (50%) screened positively. Taking clozapine and olanzapine together, 6/27 (22.2%) females and 3/47 (6.4%) males fulfilled criteria for binge eating disorder, 3/27 (11.1%) females and 2/47 (4.3%) males for bulimia nervosa. Patients who screened positively showed higher current BMIs (26.8 +/- 3.9 vs. 24.7 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)) and higher BMI increments during clozapine/olanzapine treatment (3.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 2.6 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2)) than patients who screened negatively. We conclude that clozapine/olanzapine may induce binge eating and full blown eating disorders which may have predictive value for weight gain. For future research in this field we suggest a novel DSM-IV research classification \"Medication-induced eating disorders\".", 
    "96": "Recent studies indicate that ammonia and hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling can induce protein tyrosine nitration (PTN) in astrocytes with potential pathogenetic relevance for hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Because HE episodes are known to be precipitated also by sedatives, the effects of benzodiazepines on PTN in cultured rat astrocytes and rat brain in vivo were studied. In cultured rat astrocytes, diazepam, PK11195, Ro5-4864, and the benzodiazepine binding inhibitor (DBI), which acts on peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, induced PTN. Clonazepam, a specific ligand of the central benzodiazepine receptor, failed to induce PTN. Nanomolar concentrations of DBI and PK11195 were sufficient to increase PTN, and diazepam effects were already observed at concentrations of 1 micromol/L. Diazepam-induced PTN was insensitive to NOS inhibition and uric acid but was blunted by MK-801, BAPTA-AM, W13, and catalase, suggesting an involvement of NMDA-receptor activation, elevation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration [Ca(2+)](i), and hydrogen peroxide. Diazepam induced a plateau-like increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), which are both blunted by MK-801 and BAPTA-AM. The expression of functional N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on cultured rat astrocytes was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, immunhistochemistry, and receptor autoradiography. Astroglial PTN is also found in brains from rats challenged with diazepam, indicating the in vivo relevance of the present findings. In conclusion, production of ROIs and increased PTN by benzodiazepines may alter astrocyte function and thereby contribute to the precipitation of HE episodes.",

    "107": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is known to participate in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Abnormal processing of APP through the action of the beta- and gamma-secretases leads to the production of the 39-43 amino acid Abeta fragment, which is neurotoxic and which is believed to play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. PKC activation enhances alpha-secretase activity, which results in a decrease of the amyloidogenic products of beta-secretase. In this article, we describe the synthesis of 10 new benzolactam V8 based PKC activators having side chains of varied saturation and lipophilicity linked to the aromatic ring through an amide group. The K(i) values measured for the inhibition of phorbol ester binding to PKCalpha are in the nanomolar range and show some correlation with their lipophilicity. Compounds 5g and 5h show the best binding affinity among the 10 benzolactams that were synthesized. By use of a cell line derived from an AD patient, significant enhancement of sAPPalpha secretion was achieved at 1 microM concentration for most of the compounds studied and at 0.1 microM for compounds 5e and 5f. At 1 microM the enhancement of sAPPalpha secretion for compounds 5c-h is higher than that observed for the control compound 8-(1-decynyl)benzolactam (BL). Of interest is the absence of activity found for the highly lipophilic ligand 5i, which has a K(i) of 11 nM. On the other hand, its saturated counterpart 5j, which possesses a comparable K(i) and ClogP, retains activity in the secretase assay. In the hyperplasia studies, 5f showed a modest response at 100 microg and 5e at 300 microg, suggesting that 5f was approximately 30-fold less potent than the PKC activator mezerein and 100-fold less potent than TPA. 5e was approximately 3-fold less active than 5f. On the basis of the effect of unsaturation for other potent PKC ligands, we would predict that 5e would retain biological activity in most assays but would show a marked loss of tumor-promoting activity. Compound 5e thus becomes a viable candidate compound in the search for Alzheimer's therapeutics capable of modulating amyloid processing.", 
    "108": "Emergency medical services (EMS) providers must often manage violent or combative patients. The data regarding violence against EMS personnel are poor, but according to studies conducted thus far, between 0.8% and 5.0% of incidents to which EMS personnel respond involve violence or the threat of violence. Physical or chemical restraint is usually the only option available to emergency care providers to control violent patients. Physical restraint, however, can lead to sudden death in otherwise healthy patients, possibly as a result of positional asphyxia, severe acidosis, or a patient's excited delirium. Chemical restraint has traditionally consisted of either neuroleptics or benzodiazepines, but those drugs also have drawbacks. Haloperidol and droperidol, the neuroleptics most frequently used for restraint, can cause serious side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms or QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) prolongation. The Food and Drug Administration recently issued a black box warning regarding the use of droperidol, because the QTc prolongation associated with the drug has led to fatal torsades de pointes in some patients. Benzodiazepines are also associated with adverse effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, especially when the drugs are mixed with alcohol. The atypical antipsychotics, a new option that may be available soon, are less likely to cause such effects and therefore may be preferred over the neuroleptics. Liquid and injectable formulations of various atypical antipsychotics are currently in clinical trials. Because few options are currently available to EMS personnel for managing violent patients outside of the hospital, more research regarding violence against emergency care providers is necessary.", 
    "109": "Malingering to obtain medications of abuse is well documented in the general medical setting. However, we have found no cases previously reported of such malingering in a veterinary setting. We report five cases submitted by veterinarians in which clients (pet owners) are strongly suspected or confirmed to have been engaging in malingering to obtain controlled medications for their personal use. Cases bear a striking resemblance to malingering in the general medical setting for drugs to abuse. We propose that veterinarians, like their medical counterparts, are potential targets of malingering by their clients for drugs of abuse. Because of their familiarity with this condition, psychiatrists may have a role in training veterinarians to recognize malingering on the part of their human clients. In addition, psychiatrists may benefit from familiarizing themselves with novel forms of malingering, such as are presented in this case series.",

    "114": "The stiff-person syndrome is a rare and disabling disorder, characterized by muscle rigidity with superimposed painful spasms involving axial and limb musculature. The clinical symptoms are continuous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles caused by involuntary motor-unit firing at rest and the spasms that are precipitated by tactile stimuli, passive strach, volitional movement of affected or unaffected muscles, startling noises and emotional stimuli. Both the rigidity and the spasms are relieved by sleep, general anaesthesia, myoneural blockade and peripheral nerve blockade. The cause of the stiff-person syndrome is unknown but an autoimmune pathogenesis is suspected because 1) the presence in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotrasmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 2) the association of the disease with other autoimmune disorders, 3) the presence of various autoantibodies and 4) a strong immunogenetic association. The stiff-person syndrome is clinically elusive but potentially treatable and should be considered in patients with unexplained stiffness and spasms. Drugs that enhance GABA neurotransmission, such as diazepam, vigabatrin and baclofen, provide modest relief of clinical symptoms. Immunomodulatory agents such as steroids, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin, seem to offer substantial improvement.", 
    "115": "The function of beta-endorphin immunoreactive material (IRM) released under perioperative conditions remains to be clarified. In 17 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, we determined beta-endorphin IRM in venous blood plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before surgery (t(A)); after termination of surgery and general anesthesia, but still under spinal anesthesia (t(B)); on occurrence of postoperative pain (t(C)); and 1 day after the operation (t(D)). Pain severity was rated by the patients by using a visual analog scale. Patients felt postoperative pain (t(C)), but they felt no pain at times t(A), t(B), and t(D). beta-Endorphin IRM plasma levels before surgery (t(A)) or with postoperative pain (t(C)) proved to be significantly higher than levels determined just after surgery, but still under spinal anesthesia (t(B)), or those determined 1 day after the operation (t(D)); beta-endorphin IRM plasma levels at times t(A) and t(C) correlated positively with postoperative pain severity (t(C)). beta-Endorphin IRM CSF levels after surgery, but still under spinal anesthesia (t(B)), were significantly higher than levels determined at times t(A), t(C), or t(D). No correlation was found between beta-endorphin IRM CSF levels and pain severity. In conclusion, postoperative pain severity appears to be related to beta-endorphin IRM levels in plasma before surgery as well as with postoperative pain; the analgesic significance of this material remains to be elucidated.", 
    "116": "We compared two available oral formulations of midazolam with respect to sedation score and plasma midazolam levels in pediatric surgical patients 2-10 yr old.

ASA status I-II patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg/kg of either the commercial syrup (Group 1) or the prepared mixture (Group 2) as anesthetic premedication. Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores were obtained by a blinded observer at 15 and 30 min after drug administration. Plasma midazolam levels were acquired exactly 45, 60, and 90 min after administration. Group 2 patients had a significantly lower median Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score (Group 1, 17; Group 2, 15) at 30 min (P < 0.03) and significantly higher mean plasma midazolam levels at all three acquisition times (mean +/- SD) (45 min: 63.1 +/- 23.9 ng/mL, Group 2; 43.4 +/- 19.6 ng/mL, Group 1; 60 min: 45.8 +/- 18.2 ng/mL, Group 2; 30.8 +/- 17.9 ng/mL, Group 1; 90 min: 28.9 +/- 12.6 ng/mL, Group 2; 21.0 +/- 8.9 ng/mL, Group 1) (P < 0.02).

Most respondents had used benzodiazepines during the preceding 6 months, and more than one-third (Melbourne 36%, 95% CI, 28-44; Hobart 37%, 95% CI, 27-47) had injected benzodiazepines during this period. Diazepam was the preferred benzodiazepine for those using orally, while intravenous benzodiazepine users preferred to inject temazepam. Benzodiazepine injection for Melbourne IDU was related to greater levels of injection-related health problems. Patterns of benzodiazepine use amongst Melbourne and Hobart IDU are different to that in other Australian jurisdictions, with available data suggesting that prevalence of injection may be increasing. Ongoing monitoring of benzodiazepine injection, together with in-depth studies of supply characteristics and health impacts in jurisdictions where significant trends are detected is needed.

We carried out a prospective, open study, in 19 patients (11 men) with RGCSE in the intensive care unit at Firat Medical Center in Elazig. When intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg diazepam (three times at 5-min intervals), 20 mg/kg phenytoin, and 20 mg/kg phenobarbital failed to bring the episode under control, patients were administered an intravenous bolus of midazolam (200 microg/kg) followed by a continuous infusion at 1 microg/kg min. The dose was increased by 1 microg/kg min every 15 min until the episode of seizure was brought under control. The time from beginning of treatment to control of seizures, infusion rate, and side-effects were monitored. The mean age of the patients was 40.4 years (range 16-87 years). The clinical etiology of RGCSE was idiopathic epilepsy (6 cases), anoxicischemic cerebral insult due to cardiac arrest (3), viral encephalitis (2), intrahemispheric hematoma due to hemorrhagic stroke (1), cerebral infarct due to ischemic stroke (1), pituitary adenoma (1), post-traumatic epilepsy (1), renal failure (1), tuberculous meningitis (1), and unknown (2). In eighteen (94.7%) patients, seizures were completely controlled in a mean time of 45 min (range, 5-120 min) at a mean infusion rate of 8 microg/kg min (range, 3-21 microg/kg min). In one patient seizures did not stop. Midazolam administration did not cause any significant change in blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, or respiratory status. The mean time to full consciousness for patients after stopping the infusion was 1.6 hours (range, 2.0-8.5 hours). The mean infusion duration of midazolam was 14.5 hours (range, 12-25 hours). Midazolam is an effective and safe drug to control RGCSE, and may represent a substantial improvement over current therapeutic approaches such as pentobarbital anesthesia.", 
    "124": "Standard tests of murine unconditioned anxiety such as the elevated plus-maze and light-dark test are based on a dichotomy of avoidance behaviour (walled vs. open arms and dark vs. light compartments). We combined the principles of both tests by modifying the elevated plus-maze as follows: one walled arm was made transparent and had a white floor (WTW), whereas the other walled arm was opaque-gray having a black floor (WOB). Furthermore, one open arm had a white floor (OW), while the other had a black one (OB). These modifications allow the distinction between more than two sub-compartments that elicit different degrees of avoidance behaviour, thus having a higher discriminative potency. Additionally, the paradigm was thought to permit the within-task detection of pharmacological side effects on the perception of the anxiogenic stimuli provided. The degree of avoidance of the sub-compartments exhibited by saline-treated mice for the distal parts of the four arms was distributed as follows: WOB<WTW=OB<OW. This pattern demonstrates that the sub-compartments elicited at least three differed degrees of fear in control mice, and that these were able to discriminate between bright/dark compartments WOB vs. WTW and OB vs. OW. Diazepam given at 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg doses increased the number of entries into the distal part of the most aversive open white arm and increased the total time spent on the undivided open white arm. Both the 2 and 3 mg/kg dose increased motor activity and impaired bright/dark discrimination for the open but not for the walled arms. Thus, the graded anxiety test might be useful to screen for substances that retain the normal perception of anxiogenic stimuli, but prevent the transact of fear into undue panic reactions.",

    "130": "Three trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data on level of sedation from the three trials could not be combined for meta-analysis because of differences in tools used to measure sedation levels. Two studies (Jacqz-Aigrain 1994, Arya 2001) showed a statistically significantly higher level of sedation in the midazolam group compared to the placebo group. The third study (Anand 1999) comparing midazolam to morphine and placebo found no statistically significant difference in sedation level among the three groups, but a statistically significantly higher level of sedation was found in the midazolam group compared with the placebo group during the treatment infusion. However, since the sedation scales used in all three studies have not been validated in preterm infants, the effectiveness of midazolam as a sedative in this population could not be ascertained. In the study by Jacqz-Aigrain et al (Jacqz-Aigrain 1994), blood pressure was statistically significantly lower in the midazolam group than in the placebo group on days one and two, although there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hypotension requiring albumin or vasoactive drugs between groups. The study by Anand et al (Anand 1999) showed a statistically significant higher incidence of adverse neurologic events (death, grade III-IV IVH, PVL) in the midazolam group compared with the other groups. In addition, meta-analysis of available data from two studies (Jacqz-Aigrain 1994, Anand 1999) showed a statistically significantly longer duration of NICU stay in the midazolam group compared to the placebo group (WMD 5.4 days, 95%CI 0.4, 10.5). Meta-analyses of other secondary outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the midazolam and placebo groups.",

    "137": "Twenty one trials are included. Attrition from olanzapine versus placebo studies was so great (olanzapine - 61%, placebo - 73% by six weeks, RR 0.85 CI 0.7-0.98, NNT 8 CI 5-40) that interpretation of results is problematic. Olanzapine appeared superior to placebo at six weeks for the outcome of 'no important clinical response' (RR 0.88 CI 0.8-0.98, NNT 8 CI 5-27) and global mental state scores. Although dizziness and dry mouth were reported more frequently in the olanzapine-treated group, this did not reach statistical significance. Tthe olanzapine group gained more weight. When compared to typical antipsychotic drugs, data from several small trials are incomplete; but, for the short term outcome of 'no important clinical response', olanzapine seem as effective as typical antipsychotics (n=2778, RR 0.9 CI 0.76-1.06). Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) data tended to be equivocal but Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) rating of total score and negative and positive symptom sub-scores favoured olanzapine. With high attrition in both groups (olanzapine - 36%, typical drug - 49% by 6 weeks, n=2738, RR 0.85 CI 0.66-1.1; olanzapine - 83%, typical drug - 90% by 1 year, n=2738, RR 0.9 CI 0.86-1.02), the assumptions included in all continuous data are considerable. Participants allocated olanzapine experienced fewer extrapyramidal side effects than people given haloperidol. Weight change data for the short term are not conclusive (n=2455, WMD 0.8kg CI -0.6-2.2) but the three to 12 month results suggest an average gain of four kilograms (n=233, WMD 4 CI 0.3-7.8). It is difficult to distinguish between olanzapine and other atypical drugs, although it may cause fewer extrapyramidal side effects than risperidone (n=339, RR 0.6 CI 0.4-0.9, NNH 8 CI 4-29). Olanzapine did cause more weight gain than its comparators but current data are not statistically significant (3-12 months, n=535, WMD 2.2kg CI -0.6-5). One study (n=180) found no clear differences between olanzapine and clozapine for people with treatment-resistant illness.", 
    "138": "The large proportions of participants leaving the studies early, in the large multi-centre trials makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on clinical effects.

    "140": "We studied the presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptor subtypes controlling ACh release and their relationship with voltage-dependent calcium channels in the neuromuscular synapses of the Levator auris longus muscle from adult (30-40 days) and newborn (3-6 and 15 days postnatal) rats. Using intracellular recording, we studied how several muscarinic antagonists affected the evoked endplate potentials. In some experiments we previously incubated the muscle with calcium channel blockers (nitrendipine, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-Agatoxin-IVA) before determining the muscarinic response. In the adult, the M1 receptor-selective antagonist pirenzepine (10 micro m) reduced evoked neurotransmission ( approximately 47%). The M2 receptor-selective antagonist methoctramine (1 micro m) increased the evoked release ( approximately 67%). Both M1- and M2-mediated mechanisms depend on calcium influx via P/Q-type synaptic channels. We found nothing to indicate the presence of M3 (4-DAMP-sensitive) or M4 (tropicamide-sensitive) receptors in the muscles of adult or newborn rats. In the 3-6-day newborn rats, pirenzepine reduced the evoked release ( approximately 30%) by a mechanism independent of L-, N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, and the M2 antagonist methoctramine (1 micro m) unexpectedly decreased the evoked release ( approximately 40%). This methoctramine effect was a P/Q-type calcium-channel-dependent mechanism. However, upon maturation in the first two postnatal weeks, the M2 pathway shifted to perform the calcium-dependent release-inhibitory activity found in the adult. We show that the way in which M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors modulate neurotransmission can differ between the developing and adult rat neuromuscular synapse.", 
    "141": "In the cochlea, glutamate plays a major role in synaptic transmission between the inner hair cell and the primary auditory neurons. Extracellular glutamate concentration must be regulated to prevent excitotoxicity. This regulation is mediated by excitatory amino acid transporters, membrane proteins that remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. In this study, we investigated the distribution and activity of three excitatory amino acid transporters subtypes in the guinea-pig cochlea: glutamate aspartate transporter, glutamate transporter and excitatory amino acid carrier. A partial messenger ribonucleic acid sequence was determined for each of these transporters, by polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers, using guinea-pig brain complementary deoxyribonucleic acid as the template. Primers specific for each transporter were then designed and used to screen a dissected organ of Corti complementary deoxyribonucleic acid library. The cellular distribution of each transporter was examined by immunocytochemistry. We investigated the functional consequences of inhibiting glutamate uptake by recording cochlear potentials during intracochlear perfusion with either l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid or dihydrokainate. At the end of the electrophysiological session, cochleas were processed for electron microscopy. Only the glutamate aspartate transporter messenger ribonucleic acid was detected in the organ of Corti. Consistently, glutamate aspartate transporter protein was detected in the inner hair cell-supporting cells and in the ganglion of Corti satellite cells. Glutamate transporter and excitatory amino acid carrier were found in the afferent auditory neurons. Only intracochlear perfusions with l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of the cochlear compound action potential, leaving cochlear microphonic potential unaffected. After l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid perfusion, cochleas displayed a swelling of the afferent endings typical of excitotoxicity. [(-)1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-4,5-dihydro-3-methylcarbamyl-2,3-benzodiazepine], a selective alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor antagonist protects the cochlea against l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid effect.", 
    "142": "Studies of novel centrally acting drugs in healthy volunteers are traditionally concerned with kinetics and tolerability, but useful information may also be obtained from biomarkers of clinical endpoints. A useful biomarker should meet the following requirements: a consistent response across studies and drugs; a clear response of the biomarker to a therapeutic dose; a dose-response relationship; a plausible relationship between biomarker, pharmacology and pathogenesis. In the current review, all individual tests found in studies of benzodiazepine agonists registered for anxiety in healthy volunteers since 1966 were progressively evaluated for compliance with these requirements. A MedLine search yielded 56 different studies, investigating the effects of 16 different benzodiazepines on 73 different (variants of ) neuropsychological tests, which could be clustered into seven neuropsychological domains. Subjective and objective measures of alertness were most sensitive to benzodiazepines. The most consistent effects were observed on saccadic peak velocity (SPV) and visual analogue scores ( VAS) of alertness, where 100% and 79% of all studies respectively showed statistically significant effects. A dose-response relationship could be constructed for temazepam and SPV, which was used to determine dose equivalencies relative to temazepam, for seven different benzodiazepines. These dose equivalencies correlated with the lowest recommended daily maintenance dose (r2 = 0.737, P < 0.05). This relationship between SPV reduction and clinical efficacy could reflect the clinical practice of aiming for maximum tolerated levels, or it could represent a common basis behind SPV reduction and anxiolytic activity for benzodiazepines (probably sedation). The number of tests used in human psychopharmacology appears to be excessive and their sensitivity and reproducibility low.",

    "150": "During 20th century serious mental disorders were divided into two groups according symptomatology and course of disorder. Individuals with dominating disturbance of perception, thinking and cognition were basically diagnosed having schizophrenic. Individuals with mood disturbance were basically diagnosed having affective disorders. However, there were patients who did not fit neatly into either category. In 1933 Jocob Kasanin introduced the term \"schizoaffective psychosis\". Scientific discussions involved the possibility that schizoaffective disorder was conceptualized most accurately as following: a type of schizophrenia, a type of affective disorder, a unique disorder that was separate from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an arbitrary categorization of clinical symptoms that marked a continuum between schizophrenia and affective illness, a heterogeneous collection of \"interforms\" between schizophrenia and affective disorders. However, diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is included both in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. Schizoaffective disorder is listed in the category \"schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders\". The differential diagnosis includes basically either schizophrenia or affective disorder. The epidemiological status of schizoaffective disorder is somewhat uncertain compared with schizophrenia because of dilemmas related to diagnosis and classification of the disorder. Treatment of schizoaffective disorder comprises psychotropic medication, supportive psychotherapy, social care, rehabilitation. The most important groups of psychotropic medications are: antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Atypical antipsychotics are the first-line medication for schizoaffective disorder due to their pharmacological properties. In the case of schizoaffective disorders combination of atypical antipsychotics with antidepressants seems to be useful. Novel antidepressants have priority for the combination mentioned above. Peculiarities of mechanism of action of antidepressant are important for combinations. Mood stabilizers seem to be useful for treatment of certain type of schizoaffective disorder as well.",

The classes of medications included: zopiclone, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antihistamines and no medication. The sample comprised a sub-set of respondents from 2620 questionnaires of the Canadian Multicentre Sleep Database. Respondents for this database were contacted through physicians, announcements in the media and local pharmacies. The results indicated that gender alone was not associated with differential prescribing for insomnia, nor was gender associated with patterns of medication use such as frequency of taking medication, length of use, taking more or less medication than prescribed or attempts to stop taking medication. Demographic factors were included in the analysis and age and marital status were associated with different prescribing patterns for men and women with insomnia. It is possible that physicians refer to stereotypic expectations when prescribing hypnotics.", 
    "157": "This study examined the potential for cognitive morbidity associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepine (BZ) sedative-hypnotics in a sample of healthy older adults. Tests of memory, attention and processing speed were conducted prior to and 1 month after drug discontinuation for 25 BZ-users and at similar intervals for 26 healthy control subjects. After controlling for differences in affective status between BZ-users and controls, there were no significant group differences in cognitive performance. However, BZ-users showed greater gains on tests of attention and speed of processing at repeat testing compared with controls this improvement was not attributable to a change in affective status. These findings suggest that there may be subtle and reversible effects of long-term BZ use on speed-dependent tasks in older adults. However, the magnitude of these effects is quite small and may be of little clinical significance in the healthy elderly.", 
    "158": "Some anticonvulsants show neuroprotective effects, and may be of use in reducing neuronal death resulting from stroke or traumatic brain injury. Here I report that a broad range of anticonvulsants protect cells in hippocampal slice cultures from death induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). Hippocampal slice cultures were submitted to 1 h OGD and the resulting cell death was quantified 24 h later using a novel automated fluorescent scanning method. The classical anticonvulsants phenobarbital, phenytoin, ethosuximide, chlordiazepoxide and midazolam all significantly and dose-dependently reduced cell death induced by OGD. The newer anticonvulsants carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, and oxcarbazepine also had significant neuroprotective effects, but gabapentin, valproic acid (10 mM), levetiracetam and retigabine were not neuroprotective at a concentration up to 300 microM. In conclusion, several classical and newer anticonvulsants have neuroprotective properties in an in vitro model that simulates cerebral ischemia.",

In this respect, insomnia associated with a major depression or an anxiety disorder, mainly generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), is the most prevalent diagnosis. According to available evidence, the sleep disturbance associated with mild-to-moderate GAD is a sleep-maintenance insomnia, and to a lesser extent a sleep-onset insomnia. Insomnia associated with mild-to-moderate GAD generally responds to psychological treatments and anxiolytic benzodiazepines. Moreover, concomitant administration of hypnotic medication can be contemplated in patients with severe GAD.", 
    "160": "World-wide use of herbal medicines is increasing, following regulatory and manufacturing developments. Herbs are attractive alternative medications to many patients with sleep disorders, who may be averse to using conventional drugs. We review here the most common herbal stimulants and sedatives. Caffeine, in herbal teas, black tea, coffee, soft drinks and pharmaceuticals, is used widely to control sleepiness, but more research is needed on its use in sleep disorders. Ephedra, and its constituent ephedrine, are used in both stimulant and weight loss preparations, sometimes with caffeine; safety concerns have arisen with this practice. Yohimbe is another herb used in stimulant and body-building preparations which has safety concerns. Asian and Siberian ginseng have been traditionally used for fatigue, and have some supportive experimental evidence for this use. Herbal sedatives also have some evidence for efficacy; the observations that certain plant flavonoid compounds bind to benzodiazepine receptors adds interest to their use. Valerian and kava have received the most research attention; both have decreased sleep onset time and promoted deeper sleep in small studies, and kava also shows anxiolytic effects. German chamomile, lavender, hops, lemon balm and passionflower are reputed to be mild sedatives but need much more experimental examination.", 
    "161": "Benzodiazepine hypnotics, the mainstay of pharmacological treatment for insomnia, have been associated with altered sleep architecture, psychomotor and memory impairment, rebound insomnia, withdrawal effects, tolerance, dependence, abuse potential and respiratory depression. Non-benzodiazepines, such as zolpidem, zopiclone and zaleplon, demonstrate hypnotic efficacy similar to that of benzodiazepines along with excellent safety profiles. Non-benzodiazepines generally cause less disruption of normal sleep architecture than benzodiazepines. Psychomotor and memory impairment may be less problematic with non-benzodiazepines, especially when compared to longer-acting benzodiazepines. Rebound insomnia and withdrawal symptoms occur infrequently upon discontinuation of non-benzodiazepines and may be less common and milder than those seen upon discontinuation of some benzodiazepines. For the long-term treatment of insomnia, which is generally not recommended, zolpidem and zopiclone are particularly good options because they do not develop tolerance rapidly and have a low abuse potential. Limited data indicate that zaleplon has low tolerance and abuse potential, although further experience is needed to determine its long-term efficacy and safety profile. Since non-benzodiazepines produce minimal respiratory depression, they may be safer than benzodiazepines in patients with respiratory disorders. The choice of which hypnotic to use should be based on the patient's primary sleep complaint, health history, adverse effects and cost.", 
    "162": "Chronic primary insomnia is a recurrent condition that negatively effects the daily functioning of patients, diminishing the quality of their lives. It is associated with, and in some situations, is a risk factor in both psychiatric (depression) and physical (cardiovascular) illness. Treatment effectiveness has been shown in the short term for both drug (benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine agonists) and behavioral treatment. Expert opinion has strongly advised against long-term drug treatment because of concerns about residual sedative effects, memory impairment, falls, respiratory depression, rebound insomnia, medication abuse, dose escalation, dependency and withdrawal difficulties, and an increased risk of death possibly associated with the current hypnotic medications. Many of these concerns could be made against using these agents at all. Worries about these potential problems are challenged by the widespread clinical practice of using hypnotic drugs long-term without any of these difficulties developing and with patients who feel their sleep and daily function function is improved with the nightly use of their sleeping pill. The ability to mount a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind trial of hypnotic medication in primary insomnia may not be possible. We may have to develop large systematic clinical databases, a number of case series in effect, to monitor both emergent symptoms and possible clinical effectiveness. There is the additional concern that there is a reluctance to examine the long-term drug treatment of insomnia. This reluctance may reflect a negative moral judgement about treating primary insomnia with drugs, a sort of <pharmacological Calvinism>, rather than just a data based judiciousness.", 
    "163": "Acute stimulation of cholesterol transport into mitochondria involves the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), and the steroidogenesis acute regulatory (StAR) proteins. We investigated the respective role of these proteins in hormone-induced steroidogenesis. Oligonucleotides antisense, but not sense, to PBR and StAR reduced their respective levels in steroidogenic cells and inhibited hormone-stimulated steroid formation in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells. In search of the proteins regulating PBR we identified a protein, PAP7, which interacts with PBR and the PKA regulatory subunit RIalpha, is present in adrenal and gonadal cells and is found in mitochondria. Overexpression of the full length PAP7 increased the hormone-induced steroid production. However, inhibition of PAP7 expression reduced the gonadotropin-induced steroid formation. In search of a PBR functional antagonist that would facilitate the studies on the biological function of PBR, we screened a phage display library. A 7-mer competitive PBR peptide antagonist was identified, which when transduced into Leydig cells inhibited the benzodiazepine and hormone-stimulated steroid production suggesting that the endogenous PBR agonist/receptor interaction is critical for the hormone-dependent steroidogenesis. These data indicate that hormone-induced cholesterol transport and the subsequent steroid formation is a dynamic multistep process involving protein-protein interactions.", 
    "164": "The MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line produces large amounts of steroids only in response to hormonal stimulation while the R2C rat Leydig tumor cell line is constitutively steroidogenic in nature. In an effort to uncover the potential reasons for constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C cells, we have recently shown that compared to MA-10 cells, R2C cells express much higher levels of the Scavenger Receptor Class B type 1 which results in a higher capacity for cholesteryl ester uptake through the selective uptake pathway. We also found an enhanced expression of Hormone Sensitive Lipase and the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein in these cells and reasoned that they may further facilitate the conversion of cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol and its mobilization to the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus rendering them constitutively steroidogenic. Given the proposed role of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in conferring a constitutively steroidogenic phenotype to the R2C cells, the current study was conducted to investigate the relationship between its expression in MA-10 and R2C cells and correlate it with the constitutive nature of R2C cell steroidogenesis. Our studies show that PBR expression as measured by PK 11195 ligand binding and Western analysis is much higher in MA-10 cells than R2C cells. We also determined that the affinity of ligand binding to the PBR is comparable in the two cell lines, suggesting that PBR is unlikely to be solely responsible for the constitutive nature of R2C cell steroidogenesis."
