(1) However, in more recent years, these drugs have been used as adjuncts for sedation and to reduce anesthetic requirements. This review will provide an historical perspective of this drug class, an understanding of pharmacological mechanisms, and an insight into current applications in clinical anesthesiology.", 
    "1": "Intravenous sedation is frequently provided by anesthesiologists for phobic patients undergoing elective dental treatment in outpatient settings. Propofol is one of the most commonly used anesthetic agents that can result in apnea and respiratory depression, thereby posing potential difficulties with perioperative airway management. Dexmedetomidine has been utilized successfully in intravenous sedation for a wide variety of procedures and holds potential as an alternative to propofol in outpatient dental settings. However, as a single agent, it may not provide adequate depth of sedation and analgesia for oral rehabilitation. In this case report we demonstrate an effective alternative intravenous deep-sedation technique for an adult phobic patient undergoing oral rehabilitation utilizing 3 agents in combination: dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and midazolam. This combination of agents may be especially useful for those patients with a history of substance abuse, where administration of opioids may be undesirable or contraindicated.", 
    "2": "Some patients with intellectual disabilities spend longer than others in emergence from ambulatory general anesthesia for dental treatment. Although antiepileptic drugs and anesthetics might be involved, an independent predictor for delay of the emergence remains unclear. Thus, a purpose of this study is to identify independent factors affecting the delay of emergence from general anesthesia. This was a retrospective cohort study in dental patients with intellectual disabilities. Patients in need of sedative premedication were removed from participants. The outcome was time until emergence from general anesthesia. Stepwise multivariate regression analysis was used to extract independent factors affecting the outcome. Antiepileptic drugs and anesthetic parameters were included as predictor variables. The study included 102 cases. Clobazam, clonazepam, and phenobarbital were shown to be independent determinants of emergence time. Parameters relating to anesthetics, patients' backgrounds, and dental treatment were not independent factors. Delay in emergence time in ambulatory general anesthesia is likely to be related to the antiepileptic drugs of benzodiazepine or barbiturates in patients with intellectual disability.", 
    "3": "Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is a procedure which has an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases and is widely used in clinical practice. It is an invasive procedure and can cause cough, shortness of breath, nose and throat irritation. Stress during bronchoscopy can cause release of catecholamines, which may lead to tachycardia, vasoconstriction and possible myocardial ischemia in patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function. Current guidelines for bronchoscopy recommend offering sedation to patients, with the aim of improving patient comfort and reducing complications. For this purpose, the most frequently used sedatives are benzodiazepines, opioids, propofol and fospropofol which are either administered alone or in combination. In this review, we aimed to evaluate various drugs used for sedation during bronchoscopy.", 
    "4": "Phenazepam is a benzodiazepine that is predominantly used clinically in the former Soviet states but is being abused throughout the wider world. This study reports the tissue distribution and concentration of both phenazepam and 3-hydroxyphenazepam in 29 cases quantitated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a variety of post-mortem fluids (subclavian blood, femoral blood, cardiac blood, urine, vitreous humour) and tissues (thalamus, liver and psoas muscle). In 27 cases, the cause of death was not directly related to phenazepam (preserved (fluoride/oxalate) femoral blood phenazepam concentrations 0.007\u2009mg/L to 0.360\u2009mg/L (median 0.097\u2009mg/L). In two cases, phenazepam was either a contributing factor to, or the certified cause of death (preserved (fluoride/oxalate) femoral blood 0.97\u2009mg/L and 1.64\u2009mg/L). The analysis of phenazepam and 3-hydroxyphenazepam in this study suggests that they are unlikely to be subject to large post-mortem redistribution and that there is no direct correlation between tissues/fluid and femoral blood concentrations. Preliminary investigations of phenazepam stability comparing femoral blood phenazepam concentrations in paired preserved (2.5% fluoride/oxalate) and unpreserved blood show that unpreserved samples show on average a 14% lower concentration of phenazepam and we recommend that phenazepam quantitation is carried out using preserved samples wherever possible.",

    "6": "The Norwegian population in 2010 supplied 8862 deaths ages 41-80 and 898,289 controls. Index dates were added to control records which corresponded to death dates. BZZ use was recorded for 2 years before death/index date.", 
    "7": "Persons exposed to BZZ were more likely (OR\u2009=\u20092.3) to die than those who were not. With proximity of death, increasingly larger proportions of the prospective deaths received prescriptions for BZZ, until in the last 2 months 40-45% received BZZ. The frequency of BZZ use in controls increased with age as opposed to the death cohort where all ages showed similar rates of BZZ use. In the last few months before death, the youngest age group had an OR\u2009=\u20095.8 for BZZ use while the oldest age group an OR\u2009=\u20091.8, adjusted for age and sex. Opioid use showed a similar pattern of increasing use near death.", 
    "8": "The increased use of BZZ with approaching death is consistent with increasing symptomatic treatment in terminal illness. Thus, the association of BZZ and mortality is more likely to be due to confounding than to causality. Further evidence from this and other research includes similar use patterns for other drugs such as opioids, the lack of specificity in cause of death and the size of the association regarding age and time to death.", 
    "9": "Treatment-resistant seizures affect about a third of patients suffering from epilepsy. To fulfill the need for new medications targeting treatment-resistant seizures, a number of rodent models offer the opportunity to assess a variety of potential treatment approaches. The use of such models, however, has proven to be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we performed pharmacological characterization of the allylglycine (AG) seizure model, a simple in vivo model for which we demonstrated a high level of treatment resistance. (d,l)-Allylglycine inhibits glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) - the key enzyme in \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthesis - leading to GABA depletion, seizures, and neuronal damage. We performed a side-by-side comparison of mouse and zebrafish acute AG treatments including biochemical, electrographic, and behavioral assessments. Interestingly, seizure progression rate and GABA depletion kinetics were comparable in both species. Five mechanistically diverse antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were used. Three out of the five AEDs (levetiracetam, phenytoin, and topiramate) showed only a limited protective effect (mainly mortality delay) at doses close to the TD50 (dose inducing motor impairment in 50% of animals) in mice. The two remaining AEDs (diazepam and sodium valproate) displayed protective activity against AG-induced seizures. Experiments performed in zebrafish larvae revealed behavioral AED activity profiles highly analogous to those obtained in mice. Having demonstrated cross-species similarities and limited efficacy of tested AEDs, we propose the use of AG in zebrafish as a convenient and high-throughput model of treatment-resistant seizures.",

Since its first documentation in 2001, numerous studies have been dedicated to investigate its specifics. The persistent genital arousal occurs in the absence of sexual interest and fantasies and it causes excessive psychological suffering. Masturbation, spontaneous orgasm or sexual intercourse can offer only a temporary relief. Researches provide a limited insight into the characteristics of persistent genital arousal disorder.

This paper reviews knowledge on GHB and derivatives, and explores the largest series of deaths associated with their non-medical use. Descriptive analyses of cases associated with GHB/GBL and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) use extracted from the UK's National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths database. From 1995 to September 2013, 159 GHB/GBL-associated fatalities were reported. Typical victims: White (92%); young (mean age 32 years); male (82%); with a drug misuse history (70%). Most deaths (79%) were accidental or related to drug use, the remainder (potential) suicides. GHB/GBL alone was implicated in 37%; alcohol 14%; other drugs 28%; other drugs and alcohol 15%. Its endogenous nature and rapid elimination limit toxicological detection. Post-mortem blood levels: mean 482 (range 0-6500; SD 758)mg/L. Results suggest significant caution is needed when ingesting GHB/GBL, particularly with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, stimulants, and ketamine. More awareness is needed about risks associated with consumption.", 
    "18": "There remains a need for more efficacious treatments for status epilepticus. Prolonged seizures result in the release of ATP from cells which activates the P2 class of ionotropic and metabotropic purinoceptors. The P2X receptors gate depolarizing sodium and calcium entry and are expressed by both neurons and glia throughout the brain, and a number of subtypes are upregulated after status epilepticus. Recent studies have explored the in vivo effects of targeting ATP-gated P2X receptors in preclinical models of status epilepticus, with particular focus on the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R). The P2X7R mediates microglial activation and the release of the proepileptogenic inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1\u03b2. The receptor may also directly modulate neurotransmission and gliotransmission and promote the recruitment of immune cells into brain parenchyma. Data from our group and collaborators show that status epilepticus produced by intraamygdala microinjection of kainic acid increases P2X7R expression in the hippocampus and neocortex of mice. Antagonism of the P2X7R in the model reduced seizure severity, microglial activation and interleukin 1\u03b2 release, and neuronal injury. Coadministration of a P2X7R antagonist with a benzodiazepine also provided seizure suppression in a model of drug-refractory status epilepticus when either treatment alone was minimally effective. More recently, we showed that status epilepticus in immature rats is also reduced by P2X7R antagonism. Together, these findings suggest that P2X receptors may be novel targets for seizure control and interruption of neuroinflammation after status epilepticus.

Here we report that the anxiolytic drugs lorazepam and diazepam increased the time larval fish spent in the dark compartment in the light/dark test. Lorazepam did not affect the visual induced optokinetic response of larval fish. Gene expression levels of c-fos and crh were significantly increased in the hypothalamus of fish larvae underwent light/dark choice behavior, whilst lorazepam treatment alleviated the increased c-fos and crh expressions. Furthermore, we found estrogen receptor \u03b2 gene expression level was increased in fish larvae underwent light/dark choice. We next examined effects of estrogen receptor modulators (estradiol, BPA, PHTPP, and WAY-200070) in the light/dark test. We identified WAY-200070, a highly selective ER\u03b2 agonist significantly altered the light/dark choice behavior of zebrafish larvae. Further investigation showed WAY-200070 treatment caused a reduction of crh expression level in the hypothalamus, suggesting activation of ER\u03b2 signaling attenuate the stress response. Interestingly, WAY-200070 treatment caused marked increase of c-fos expression in the habenula of fish larvae underwent behavior test. These results suggest WAY-200070 activation of ER\u03b2 mediated signaling may regulate anxiety related behavior in zebrafish through modulation of neuronal activity in habenula.",

Our results show elevated Drd2 expression levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of prenatally stressed rats compared to control subjects, while repeated diazepam administration in adulthood down-regulated Drd2 expression and prevented the effect of prenatal stress. These observations suggest that prenatal stress may induce permanent alterations in the corticolimbic pathway implicated in drug-seeking behavior.",

Here, we compared ethanol-mediated behaviors in mice lacking Il1rn or Il1r1. Deletion of Il1rn (the gene encoding IL-1ra) increases sensitivity to the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol and flurazepam and reduces severity of acute ethanol withdrawal. Conversely, deletion of Il1r1 (the gene encoding the IL-1 receptor type I, IL-1R1) reduces sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol and flurazepam and increases the severity of acute ethanol withdrawal. The sedative effects of ketamine and pentobarbital were not altered in the knockout (KO) strains. Ethanol intake and preference were not changed in mice lacking Il1r1 in three different tests of ethanol consumption. Recovery from ethanol-induced motor incoordination was only altered in female mice lacking Il1r1. Mice lacking Il1rn (but not Il1r1) showed increased ethanol clearance and decreased ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion. The increased ethanol- and flurazepam-induced sedation in Il1rn KO mice was decreased by administration of IL-1ra (Kineret), and pre-treatment with Kineret also restored the severity of acute ethanol withdrawal. Ethanol-induced sedation and withdrawal severity were changed in opposite directions in the null mutants, indicating that these responses are likely regulated by IL-1R1 signaling, whereas ethanol intake and preference do not appear to be solely regulated by this pathway.",

The emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, repeated chemotherapy cycles, and patient risk factors significantly influence CINV. The use of a combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist has significantly improved the control of acute and delayed emesis in single-day chemotherapy. The first generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been very effective in the control of chemotherapy induced emesis in the first 24 h postchemotherapy (acute emesis), but have not been as effective against delayed emesis (24-120 h postchemotherapy). Palonosetron, a second generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a different half-life, a different binding capacity, and a different mechanism of action than the first generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists appears to be the most effective agent in its class.

Major risk factors for UE are: APACHE II score \u226517, agitation, physical restraints, administration of midazolam, and higher levels of consciousness. The implementation of ABCDE bundle in ICUs did not involve additional risks of UE. The prevention includes a sedation with drugs different from benzodiazepines, an early detection of patients' readiness to weaning trial from mechanical ventilation, and the adequate stabilization of the endotracheal tube, with securing systems passing behind the patient's neck.

We describe here a patient with schizophrenia under treatment of olanzapine and an anamnesis of gastric surgery, who experienced late dumping syndrome, hyperinsulinemia and overactivation of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. Dumping syndrome, however, was improved after the patient was switched from olanzapine to quetiapine.",

Rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either 5\u2009mg/kg cisplatin or saline. Additionally, 2 or 10\u2009mg/kg olanzapine were administered i.p. to the rats 10\u2009min before the administration of cisplatin and subsequently administered every 24\u2009h for 3\u2009d. Kaolin and food intake was measured using an automatic monitoring apparatus. Plasma glucose levels were measured by an enzyme electrode method. The plasma levels of insulin and intact proinsulin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The proinsulin-to-insulin (P/I) ratio was calculated. Cisplatin significantly increased kaolin intake, but decreased food intake and body weight up to 72\u2009h. Olanzapine had no effect on these parameters. Neither olanzapine nor cisplatin alone had a significant effect on the plasma levels of glucose, insulin, or proinsulin. However, a combination of olanzapine and cisplatin significantly decreased plasma insulin levels, but increased plasma intact proinsulin levels and the P/I ratio. Our results suggest that an additive deterioration of insulin-secreting beta-cell function and disturbance of glucose homeostasis should be considered during treatment of patients with olanzapine for cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting.",

    "72": "Chronic exposure to some antipsychotic medications can induce supersensitivity to dopamine receptor stimulation. This is linked to a worsening of clinical outcome and to antipsychotic treatment failure. Here we investigated the role of striatal subregions [nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate-putamen (CPu)] in the expression of antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity. We treated rats with haloperidol (HAL) or olanzapine (OLZ), using regimens that achieve clinically relevant kinetics of striatal D2 receptor occupancy. Under these conditions, HAL produces dopamine supersensitivity whereas OLZ does not. We then assessed behaviors evoked by the dopamine agonist amphetamine (AMPH). We either injected AMPH into the striatum or inhibited striatal function with microinjections of GABA receptor agonists prior to injecting AMPH systemically. HAL-treated rats were dopamine supersensitive, as indicated by sensitization to systemic AMPH-induced potentiation of both locomotor activity and operant responding for a conditioned reward (CR). Intra-CPu injections of AMPH had no effect on these behaviors, in any group. Intra-NAc injections of AMPH enhanced operant responding for CR in OLZ-treated and control rats, but not in HAL-treated rats. In HAL-treated rats, inhibition of the NAc also failed to disrupt systemic AMPH-induced potentiation of operant responding for CR. Furthermore, while intra-NAc AMPH enhanced locomotion in both HAL-treated and control animals, inhibition of the NAc disrupted systemic AMPH-induced locomotion only in control rats. Thus, antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity persistently disrupts NAc function, such that some behaviors that normally depend upon NAc dopamine no longer do so. This has implications for understanding dysfunctions in dopamine-mediated behaviors in patients undergoing chronic antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "73": "Modulation of monoaminergic systems has been the main stream of treatment for patients with mood disorders. However, recent evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of these disorders. This study pharmacologically characterized a structurally novel metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor negative allosteric modulator, DSR-98776, and evaluated its effect on rodent models of depression and mania. First, DSR-98776 in vitro profile was assessed using intracellular calcium and radioligand binding assays. This compound showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity for mGlu5 receptors by binding to the same allosteric site as 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), a known mGlu5 inhibitor. The in vivo therapeutic benefits of DSR-98776 were evaluated in common rodent models of depression and mania. In the rat forced swimming test, DSR-98776 (1-3mg/kg) significantly reduced rats immobility time after treatment for 7 consecutive days, while paroxetine (3 and 10mg/kg) required administration for 2 consecutive weeks to reduce rats immobility time. In the mouse forced swimming test, acute administration of DSR-98776 (10-30 mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility time. This effect was not influenced by 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride-induced 5-HT depletion. Finally, DSR-98776 (30 mg/kg) significantly decreased methamphetamine/chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperactivity in mice, which reflects this compound antimanic-like effect. These results indicate that DSR-98776 acts as an orally potent antidepressant and antimanic in rodent models and can be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of a broad range of mood disorders with depressive and manic states.", 
    "74": "Recent evidence suggests that inflammation-induced decrements in cognitive function can be mitigated via manipulation of excitatory or inhibitory transmission. We tested the ability of the inverse benzodiazepine agonist, MRK-016 (MRK) to protect against LPS-induced deficits in memory acquisition and consolidation, using a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm. In Experiment One, mice received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or MRK injections prior to CFC training, and were then tested 24h after training. In Experiment Two, animals received similar treatment injections immediately after training, and were tested 24h later. Additionally, hippocampal samples were collected 4h after LPS injections and immediately after testing, to evaluate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression. Results indicate that MRK can protect against LPS-induced learning/memory decrements in both paradigms. We also found, in both paradigms, that animals treated with LPS/Saline expressed significantly less BDNF mRNA when compared to Saline/Saline-treated animals 4h after LPS administration, but that MRK did not restore BDNF expression levels. Further, treatment administrations had no effect on IGF-1 mRNA expression at any collection time-point. In summary, MRK-016 can protect against LPS-induced deficits in memory acquisition and consolidation, in this hippocampus-dependent paradigm, though this protection occurs independently of recovery of BDNF expression.", 
    "75": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder characterized by episodes of nausea and vomiting lasting 1 to 5\u00a0days, followed by asymptomatic periods. The etiology and pathophysiology of CVS are unknown, but CVS shares similar characteristics to those of migraine headaches. Tricyclic antidepressants have the most evidence and are generally effective for prophylaxis of further episodes in patients with CVS. Second-line pharmacotherapies typically target specific comorbid symptoms or conditions and may include antiepileptic or antimigraine drugs, benzodiazepines, antispasmodics, proton pump inhibitors, antiemetics, and analgesics. OnabotulinumtoxinA (ONABoNT-A) injections have not been studied in the population with CVS but are regarded as a pharmacotherapeutic option for migraine headaches. We describe a 45-year-old woman with a 5-year history of CVS who had failed previous typical prophylactic migraine and CVS pharmacotherapies and was referred to the neurology clinic for management of both of these conditions. On review, the neurologist noted a correlation of the patient's headaches with her CVS symptoms. ONABoNT-A injections were started at 155 units intramuscularly every 12\u00a0weeks for her migraine headaches, which also dramatically improved her CVS. The main adverse effect reported by the patient was numbness and weakness in her left shoulder after the injections, which are symptoms consistent with ONABoNT-A injection use; however, these symptoms typically resolved a few days later. Regarded as a pharmacotherapeutic option for migraine headache prophylaxis, ONABoNT-A injections have demonstrated modest efficacy in preventing migraine headaches. Clinicians should be aware that ONABoNT-A injections may also have a role in the prophylaxis of CVS.", 
    "76": "Treatment with second-generation antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine frequently results in metabolic adverse effects, e.g. hyperphagia, weight gain and dyslipidaemia in patients of both genders. The molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic adverse effects are still largely unknown, and studies in rodents represent an important approach in their exploration. However, the validity of the rodent model is hampered by the fact that antipsychotics induce weight gain in female, but not male, rats. When administered orally, the short half-life of olanzapine in rats prevents stable plasma concentrations of the drug. We recently showed that a single intramuscular injection of long-acting olanzapine formulation yields clinically relevant plasma concentrations accompanied by several dysmetabolic features in the female rat. In the current study, we show that depot injections of 100-250 mg/kg olanzapine yielded clinically relevant plasma olanzapine concentrations also in male rats. In spite of transient hyperphagia, however, olanzapine resulted in weight loss rather than weight gain. The resultant negative feed efficiency was accompanied by a slight elevation of thermogenesis markers in brown adipose tissue for the highest olanzapine dose, but the olanzapine-related reduction in weight gain remains to be explained. In spite of the absence of weight gain, an olanzapine dose of 200mg/kg or above induced significantly elevated plasma cholesterol levels and pronounced activation of lipogenic gene expression in the liver. These results confirm that olanzapine stimulates lipogenic effects, independent of weight gain, and raise the possibility that endocrine factors may influence gender specificity of metabolic effects of antipsychotics in the rat.",

    "92": "Drug-refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is a major medical emergency with a mortality of up to 40% and the risk of severe long-term consequences. The mechanisms involved in RSE are incompletely understood. Animal models are important in developing treatment strategies for more effective termination of SE and prevention of its long-term outcomes. The pilocarpine and lithium-pilocarpine rat models are widely used in this respect. In these models, resistance to diazepam and other antiseizure drugs (ASDs) develops during SE so that an SE that is longer than 30 min is difficult to suppress. Furthermore, because all ASDs used in SE treatment are much more rapidly eliminated by rodents than by humans, SE recurs several hours after ASD treatment. Long-term consequences include hippocampal damage, behavioral alterations, and epilepsy with spontaneous recurrent seizures. In this review, different rational polytherapies for SE, which are more effective than monotherapies, are discussed, including a novel polytherapy recently developed by our group. Based on data from diverse seizure models, we hypothesized that cholinergic mechanisms are involved in the mechanisms underlying ASD resistance of SE. We, therefore, developed an intravenous drug cocktail, consisting of diazepam, phenobarbital, and the anticholinergic scopolamine. This drug combination irreversibly terminated SE when administered 60, 90, or 120 min after SE onset. The efficacy of this cocktail in terminating SE was comparable with the previously reported efficacy of polytherapies with the glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine. Furthermore, when injected 60 min after SE onset, the scopolamine-containing cocktail prevented development of epilepsy and hippocampal neurodegeneration, which was not observed with high doses of diazepam or a combination of phenobarbital and diazepam. Our data add to the existing preclinical evidence that rational polytherapy can be more effective than monotherapy in the treatment of SE and that combinatorial therapy may offer a clinically useful option for the treatment of RSE.

    "93": "Status epilepticus refractory to first-line and second-line antiepileptic treatments challenges neurologists and intensivists as mortality increases with treatment refractoriness and seizure duration. International guidelines advocate anesthetic drugs, such as continuously administered high-dose midazolam, propofol, and barbiturates, for the induction of therapeutic coma in patients with treatment-refractory status epilepticus. The seizure-suppressing effect of anesthetic drugs is believed to be so strong that some experts recommend using them after benzodiazepines have failed. Although the rationale for the use of anesthetic drugs in patients with treatment-refractory status epilepticus seems clear, the recommendation of their use in treating status epilepticus is based on expert opinions rather than on strong evidence. Randomized trials in this context are lacking, and recent studies provide disturbing results, as the administration of anesthetics was associated with poor outcome independent of possible confounders. This calls for caution in the straightforward use of anesthetics in treating status epilepticus. However, there are still more questions than answers, and current evidence for the adverse effects of anesthetic drugs in patients with status epilepticus remains too limited to advocate a change of treatment algorithms. In this overview, the rationale and the conflicting clinical implications of anesthetic drugs in patients with treatment-refractory status epilepticus are discussed, and remaining questions are elaborated.

Therefore, patients prefer to be sedated when undergoing examination, although the best combination of drugs has not been determined. The combination of opioids and benzodiazepines is used to relieve the patient's pain and discomfort. More recently, propofol has assumed a prominent position. This randomized prospective study is unique in medical literature that specifically compared the use of propofol and fentanyl with or without midazolam for colonoscopy sedation performed by anesthesiologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the side effects of sedation, discharge conditions, quality of sedation, and propofol consumption during colonoscopy, with or without midazolam as preanesthetic. The study involved 140 patients who underwent colonoscopy at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I received intravenous midazolam as preanesthetic five minutes before sedation, followed by fentanyl and propofol; Group II received intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol. Patients in Group II had a higher incidence of reaction (motor or verbal) to the colonoscope introduction, bradycardia, hypotension, and increased propofol consumption. Patient satisfaction was higher in Group I. According to the methodology used, the combination of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol for colonoscopy sedation reduces propofol consumption and provides greater patient satisfaction.",

    "100": "We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials comparing non-IV MDZ with DZP (by any route) in patients (all ages) with early SE defined either as seizures lasting >5 min or as seizures at arrival in the emergency department. The following outcomes were assessed: clinical seizure cessation within 15 min of drug administration, serious adverse effects, time interval to drug administration, and time from arrival in the emergency department to seizure cessation. Outcomes were assessed using a random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis to calculate risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR) and mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).", 
    "101": "Nineteen studies with 1933 seizures in 1602 patients (some trials included patients with more than one seizure) were included. One thousand five hundred seventy-three patients were younger than 16 years. For seizure cessation, non-IV MDZ was as effective as DZP (any route) (1933 seizures; RR: 1.03; 95% CIs: 0.98 to 1.08). No difference in adverse effects was found between non-IM MDZ and DZP by any route (1933 seizures; RR: 0.87; 95% CIs: 0.50 to 1.50). Time interval between arrival and seizure cessation was significantly shorter with non-IV MDZ by any route than with DZP by any route (338 seizures; mean difference: -3.67 min; 95% CIs: -5.98 to -1.36); a similar result was found for time from arrival to drug administration (348 seizures; mean difference: -3.56 min; 95% CIs: -5.00 to -2.11). A minimal difference was found for time interval from drug administration to clinical seizure cessation, which was shorter for DZP by any route than for non-IV MDZ by any route (812 seizures; mean difference: 0.56 min; 95% CIs: 0.15 to 0.98 min). Not all studies reported information on time intervals. Comparison by each way of administration failed to find a significant difference in terms of clinical seizure cessation and occurrence of adverse effects. The only exception was the comparison between buccal MDZ and rectal DZP, where MDZ was more effective than rectal DZP in terminating SE but only when results were expressed as OR (769 seizures; OR: 1.78; 95% CIs: 1.11 to 2.85; RR: 1.15; 95% CIs: 0.85 to 1.54). Only one study was entirely conducted in an adult population (21 patients, aged 31 to 69 years), showing no difference in efficacy or time to seizure cessation after drug administration between intranasal MDZ and rectal DZP.", 
    "102": "Non-IV MDZ is as effective and safe as intravenous or rectal DZP in terminating early SE in children and probably also in adults. Times from arrival in the emergency department to drug administration and to seizure cessation are shorter with non-IV MDZ than with intravenous or rectal DZP, but this does not necessarily result in higher seizure control. An exception may be the buccal MDZ, which, besides being socially more acceptable and easier to administer, might also have a higher efficacy than rectal DZP in seizure control.

    "103": "GABAA receptors mediate neuronal inhibition in the brain. They are the primary targets for benzodiazepines, which are widely used to treat neurological disorders including anxiety, epilepsy and insomnia. The mechanism by which benzodiazepines enhance GABAA receptor activity has been extensively studied, but there is little mechanistic information on how non-benzodiazepine drugs that bind to the same site exert their effects. Eszopiclone and zolpidem are two non-benzodiazepine drugs for which no mechanism of action has yet been proposed, despite their clinical importance as sleeping aids. Here we investigate how both drugs enhance the activity of \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA receptors.", 
    "104": "We used rapid ligand application onto macropatches and single-channel kinetic analysis to assess rates of current deactivation. We also studied synaptic currents in primary neuronal cultures and in heterosynapses, whereby native GABAergic nerve terminals form synapses with HEK293 cells expressing \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA receptors. Drug binding and modulation was quantified with the aid of an activation mechanism.", 
    "105": "At the single-channel level, the drugs prolonged the duration of receptor activation, with similar KD values of \u223c80\u2009nM. Channel activation was prolonged primarily by increasing the equilibrium constant between two connected shut states that precede channel opening.", 
    "106": "As the derived mechanism successfully simulated the effects of eszopiclone and zolpidem on ensemble currents, we propose it as the definitive mechanism accounting for the effects of both drugs. Importantly, eszopiclone and zolpidem enhanced GABAA receptor currents via a mechanism that differs from that proposed for benzodiazepines.",

No significant differences (p=0.17; t-1.39) were found in the antipsychotic dose prescribed (equivalents of chlorpromazine). However, significant differences were observed in the improvement on hospital discharge (clinical global impression severity: CGI-S), with better response in the &#8220;cycloid&#8221; group&#8221; (p=0.002; u=162).

However, controlled studies need to be carried out to confirm this.", 
    "111": "Understanding and effectively treating anxiety disorders are a challenge for both scientists and clinicians. Despite a variety of available therapies, the efficacy of current treatments is still not optimal and adverse side effects can result in non-compliance. Animal models have been useful for studying the underlying biology of anxiety and assessing the anxiolytic properties of potential therapeutics. The open field (OF) is a commonly used assay of anxiety-like behavior. The OF was developed and validated in rats and then transferred to use in the mouse with only limited validation. The present study tests the efficacy of prototypical benzodiazepine anxiolytics, chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and diazepam (DZ), for increasing center time in the OF in C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Multiple doses of CDP and DZ did not change time spent in the center of the OF. Increasing illumination in the OF did not alter these results. The non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, buspirone (BUSP) also failed to increase center time in the OF while the anxiogenic meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) increased center time. Additional inbred mouse strains, BALB/cJ (BALB) and DBA/2J (D2) did not show any change in center time in response to CDP. Moreover, evaluation of CDP in B6 mice in the elevated plus maze (EPM), elevated zero maze (EZM) and light dark assay (LD) did not reveal changes in anxiety-like behavior while stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) was decreased by DZ. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies suggest that adequate CDP is present to induce anxiolysis. We conclude that the measure of center time in the OF does not show predictive validity for anxiolysis in these inbred mouse strains.",

Here, we report a case of AU that was resistant to beta-blockers and successfully treated with clotiazepam. The clinical picture of AU resembles that of cholinergic urticaria (CU), however, positive noradrenaline test and negative acetylcholine skin test were useful for the differential diagnosis of AU and CU. Although his symptoms were resistant to several therapeutic methods including olopatadine (H1 antagonist), lafutidine (H2 antagonist) and propranolol, the severity and frequency of his attacks and his subjective symptoms were reduced by oral clotiazepam, an anxiolytic benzodiazepine.

We describe here the synthesis of peptidomimetic compounds that are based on a benzodiazepine scaffold flanked with positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids. These compounds mimic the essential properties of cationic AMPs. The new design possesses the benzodiazepine scaffold that is comprised of two glycine amino acids and which confers flexibility and aromatic hydrophobic 'back', and two arms used for further synthesis on solid phase for incorporation of charged and hydrophobic amino acids. This approach allowed us a better understanding of the influence of these features on the antimicrobial activity and selectivity. A novel compound was discovered which has MICs of 12.5\u2009\u00b5g/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and 25\u2009\u00b5g/ml against Escherichia coli, similar to the well-known antimicrobial peptide MSI-78.

Here we investigated the other components that contribute to the effects of spikenard. Six oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, including aristolane- and guaiane-types, were isolated from an acetone extract of spikenard. We evaluated the sedative activities of these oxygenated compounds using an inhalation administration method in a caffeine-treated excitatory mouse model. We identified aristolen-1(10)-en-9-ol and patchouli alcohol as highly effective sedative components. These compounds inhibited locomotion in mice by approximately 60% at a dose of 300 \u00b5g/cage. In addition, aristolen-1(10)-en-9-ol prolonged pentobarbital-induced sleep to the same extent as 1 mg/kg diazepam. This effect completely disappeared with the administration of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (3 mg/kg), suggesting that the sedative effect of aristolen-1(10)-en-9-ol is expressed via the GABAergic system. Furthermore, differently from diazepam, inhalation of aristolen-1(10)-en-9-ol for 1 h did not affect the motor coordination in the rota-rod test.

The functional properties of the two 1,5-benzodiazepines were characterized at the human \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) subtypes \u03b11\u03b22\u03b3(2S), \u03b12\u03b22\u03b3(2S), \u03b13\u03b22\u03b3(2S), \u03b15\u03b22\u03b3(2S) and \u03b16\u03b22\u03b4 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by use of two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology and compared to those exhibited by the 1,4-benzodiazepine clonazepam. All three compounds potentiated GABA EC20-evoked responses through the \u03b1(1,2,3,5)\u03b22\u03b3(2S) GABA(A)Rs in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner, with each displaying similar EC50 values at the four subtypes. Furthermore, the degrees of potentiation of the GABA EC20 currents through the four receptors mediated by saturating modulator concentrations did not differ substantially for any of the three benzodiazepines. The three compounds were substantially less potent (200-3900 fold) as positive allosteric modulators at the \u03b16\u03b22\u03b4 GABA(A)R than at the \u03b1(1,2,3,5)\u03b22\u03b3(2S) receptors. Interestingly, however, clobazam and especially N-desmethylclobazam were highly efficacious potentiators of \u03b16\u03b22\u03b4 receptor signaling. Although this activity component is unlikely to contribute to the in vivo effects of clobazam/N-desmethylclobazam, the 1,5-benzodiazepine could constitute an interesting lead for novel modulators targeting this low-affinity binding site in GABAARs. In conclusion, the non-selective modulation exerted by clobazam, N-desmethylclobazam and clonazepam at the \u03b11\u03b22\u03b3(2S), \u03b12\u03b22\u03b3(2S), \u03b13\u03b22\u03b3(2S) and \u03b15\u03b22\u03b3(2S) GABA(A)Rs indicate that the observed clinical differences between clobazam and 1,4-benzodiazepines are likely to arise from factors other than their respective pharmacological properties at the GABA(A)Rs as investigated here.", 
    "160": "Tonic conductance mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors has been implicated in the modulation of network oscillatory activity. Using an in vitro brain slice to produce oscillatory activity and a kinetic model of GABAA receptor dynamics, we show that changes in tonic inhibitory input to fast spiking interneurons underlie benzodiazepine-site mediated modulation of neuronal network synchrony in rat primary motor cortex. We found that low concentrations (10 nM) of the benzodiazepine site agonist, zolpidem, reduced the power of pharmacologically-induced beta-frequency (15-30 Hz) oscillatory activity. By contrast, higher doses augmented beta power. Application of the antagonist, flumazenil, also increased beta power suggesting endogenous modulation of the benzodiazepine binding site. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that pharmacologically-induced rhythmic inhibitory postsynaptic currents were reduced by 10 nM zolpidem, suggesting an action on inhibitory interneurons. Further voltage-clamp studies of fast spiking cells showed that 10 nM zolpidem augmented a tonic inhibitory GABAA receptor mediated current in fast spiking cells whilst higher concentrations of zolpidem reduced the tonic current. A kinetic model of zolpidem-sensitive GABAA receptors suggested that incubation with 10 nM zolpidem resulted in a high proportion of GABAA receptors locked in a kinetically slow desensitized state whilst 30 nM zolpidem favoured rapid transition into and out of desensitized states. This was confirmed experimentally using a challenge with saturating concentrations of GABA. Selective modulation of an interneuron-specific tonic current may underlie the reversal of cognitive and motor deficits afforded by low-dose zolpidem in neuropathological states.", 
    "161": "The sigma-2 receptor is a steroid-binding membrane-associated receptor which has been implicated in cell survival. Sigma-2 has recently been shown to bind amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) oligomers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Furthermore, blocking this interaction was shown to prevent or reverse the effects of A\u03b2 to cause cognitive impairment in mouse models and synaptic loss in neuronal cultures. In the present work, the density of sigma-2 receptors was measured in a double transgenic mouse model of amyloid-\u03b2 deposition (APP/PS1). Comparisons were made between males and females and between transgenic and wt animals. Sigma-2 receptor density was assessed by quantitative autoradiography performed on coronal brain slices using [(3)H]N-[4-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl]-2-methoxy-5-methyl-benzamide ([(3)H]RHM-1), which has a 300-fold selectivity for the sigma-2 receptor over the sigma-1 receptor. The translocator protein of 18\u00a0kDa (TSPO) is expressed on activated microglia and is a marker for neuroinflammation. TSPO has been found to be upregulated in neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. Therefore, in parallel with the sigma-2 autoradiography experiments, we measured TSPO expression using the selective radioligand, [(3)H]PBR28. We also quantified A\u03b2 plaque burden in the same animals using a monoclonal antibody raised against aggregated A\u03b2. Sigma-2 receptor density was significantly decreased in piriform and motor cortices as well as striata of 16-month old female, but not male, APP/PS1 mice as compared to their wt counterparts. [(3)H]PBR28 binding and immunostaining for A\u03b2 plaques were significantly increased in piriform and motor cortices of both male and female transgenic mice. In striatum however, significant increases were observed only in females.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-term fasting (36 h) on P450-mediated drug metabolism. In a randomized crossover study design, nine healthy subjects ingested a cocktail consisting of five P450-specific probe drugs [caffeine (CYP1A2), S-warfarin (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), metoprolol (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4)] on two occasions (control study after an overnight fast and after 36 h of fasting). Blood samples were drawn for pharmacokinetic analysis using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. In addition, we studied in Wistar rats the effects of short-term fasting on hepatic mRNA expression of P450 isoforms corresponding with the five studied P450 enzymes in humans. In the healthy subjects, short-term fasting increased oral caffeine clearance by 20% (P = 0.03) and decreased oral S-warfarin clearance by 25% (P < 0.001). In rats, short-term fasting increased mRNA expression of the orthologs of human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (P < 0.05), and decreased the mRNA expression of the ortholog of CYP2C9 (P < 0.001) compared with the postabsorptive state. These results demonstrate that short-term fasting alters cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism in a nonuniform pattern. Therefore, short-term fasting is another factor affecting cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism in humans.", 
    "163": "Patients with depression often also present symptoms of anxiety. First-line pharmacotherapy of comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety is often a combination therapy of an antidepressant agent, which is combined with benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines pose the drawbacks of being associated with cognitive and motor impairments and hold a significant risk for dependence. For some patients, benzodiazepines are contraindicated or patients refuse to take them. Therefore, alternative therapy strategies for the acute treatment of anxiety symptoms in depressed patients are urgently needed. A selective Medline/Pubmed search with focus on acute pharmacological treatment strategies for anxiety and agitation in depressed patients was undertaken. In the light of the paucity of studies in this field, positive effects could be assumed for quetiapine, olanzapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, pregabaline and silexan.",

The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of NphOHe and NphODe can be described by the acidic pKa-shift of a single amino acid residue, which varies from 8.9 in the free HSA to 7.6 and 7.0 in the HSA:NphOHe and HSA:NphODe complex, respectively; the pK>a-shift appears to be correlated to the length of the fatty acid tail of the substrate.

    "210": "Neurosteroids can modulate the activity of the GABAA receptors, and thus affect anxiety-like behaviors. The non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic compound etifoxine has been shown to increase neurosteroid concentrations in brain tissue but the mode of action of etifoxine on neurosteroid formation has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we have thus investigated the effect and the mechanism of action of etifoxine on neurosteroid biosynthesis using the frog hypothalamus as an experimental model. Exposure of frog hypothalamic explants to graded concentrations of etifoxine produced a dose-dependent increase in the biosynthesis of 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone and tetrahydroprogesterone, associated with a decrease in the production of dihydroprogesterone. Time-course experiments revealed that a 15-min incubation of hypothalamic explants with etifoxine was sufficient to induce a robust increase in neurosteroid synthesis, suggesting that etifoxine activates steroidogenic enzymes at a post-translational level. Etifoxine-evoked neurosteroid biosynthesis was not affected by the central-type benzodiazepine (CBR) receptor antagonist flumazenil, the translocator protein (TSPO) antagonist PK11195 or the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. In addition, the stimulatory effects of etifoxine and the triakontatetraneuropeptide TTN, a TSPO agonist, were additive, indicating that these two compounds act through distinct mechanisms. Etifoxine also induced a rapid stimulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis from frog hypothalamus homogenates, a preparation in which membrane receptor signalling is disrupted. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that etifoxine stimulates neurosteroid production through a membrane receptor-independent mechanism.", 
    "211": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant with rapid onset and short duration of action. Midazolam is the current drug of choice for acute seizures and status epilepticus, including those caused by organophosphate nerve agents. The antiseizure activity of midazolam is thought to result from its allosteric potentiation of synaptic GABA(A) receptors in the brain. However, there are indications that benzodiazepines promote neurosteroid synthesis via the 18-kDa cholesterol transporter protein (TSPO). Therefore, we investigated the role of neurosteroids and their extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor targets in the antiseizure activity of midazolam. Here, we used \u03b4-subunit knockout (DKO) mice bearing a targeted deletion of the extrasynaptic receptors to investigate the contribution of the extrasynaptic receptors to the antiseizure activity of midazolam using the 6-Hz and hippocampus kindling seizure models. In both models, midazolam produced rapid and dose-dependent protection against seizures (ED50, 0.4 mg/kg). Moreover, the antiseizure potency of midazolam was undiminished in DKO mice compared with control mice. Pretreatment with PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide], a TSPO blocker, or finasteride, a 5\u03b1-reductase neurosteroid inhibitor, did not affect the antiseizure effect of midazolam. The antiseizure activity of midazolam was significantly reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. Plasma and brain levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone were not significantly greater in midazolam-treated animals. These studies therefore provide strong evidence that neurosteroids and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors are not involved in the antiseizure activity of midazolam, which mainly occurs through synaptic GABA(A) receptors via direct binding to benzodiazepine sites. This study reaffirms midazolam's use for controlling acute seizures and status epilepticus.", 
    "212": "The synthetic rodenticide, tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TMDT), is a persistent and highly lethal GABA-gated Cl(-) channel blocker. TMDT is clandestinely produced, remains popular in mainland China, and causes numerous unintentional and deliberate poisonings worldwide. TMDT is odorless, tasteless, and easy to manufacture, features that make it a potential weapon of terrorism. There is no effective treatment. We previously characterized the effects of TMDT in C57BL/6 mice and surveyed efficacies of GABAergic and glutamatergic anticonvulsant treatments. At 0.4 mg/kg i.p., TMDT produced neurotoxic symptomatology consisting of twitches, clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, often progressing to status epilepticus and death. If administered immediately after the occurrence of the first clonic seizure, the benzodiazepine diazepam (DZP) effectively prevented all subsequent seizure symptoms, whereas the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) primarily prevented tonic-clonic seizures. The latter agent, however, appeared to be more effective at preventing delayed death. The present study further explored these phenomena, and characterized the therapeutic actions of DZP and MK-801 as combinations. Joint treatment with both DZP and MK-801 displayed synergistic protection against tonic-clonic seizures and 24 h lethality as determined by isobolographic analysis. Clonic seizures, however, remained poorly controlled. A modification of the treatment regimen, where DZP was followed 10 min later by MK-801, yielded a reduction in both types of seizures and improved overall outcome. Simultaneous monitoring of subjects via EEG and videography confirmed effectiveness of this sequential regimen. We conclude that TMDT blockage at GABAA receptors involves early activation of NMDA receptors, which contribute to persistent ictogenic activity. Our data predict that a sequential combination treatment with DZP followed by MK-801 will be superior to either individual therapy with, or simultaneous administration of, these two agents in treating TMDT poisoning.",

    "217": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that blocks multiple neuronal receptors involved in the nausea and vomiting pathways. It has therefore been studied for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis and in patients in palliative care presenting nausea and vomiting refractory to standard antiemetics. Some studies have shown that olanzapine was not inferior to aprepitant in the prophylaxis of highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and that it increased the rate of complete response when added to a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist, aprepitant and dexamethasone. These studies present so many shortcomings, however, that they do not permit us to draw any firm conclusions. Oral olanzapine showed superior antiemetic efficacy to metoclopramide as rescue treatment to control breakthrough emesis induced by chemotherapy. However, an oral formulation is not appropriate because in patients with vomiting or severe nausea the mere ingestion of an oral drug could induce emesis. Finally, in palliative care olanzapine could control or reduce the intensity of nausea and vomiting refractory to standard antiemetics.",

    "222": "Benzodiazepine drugs belong to important and most widely used medicaments. They demonstrate such therapeutic properties as anxiolytic, sedative, somnifacient, anticonvulsant, diastolic and muscle relaxant effects. However, despite the fact that benzodiazepines possess high therapeutic index and are considered to be relatively safe, their use can be dangerous when: (1) co-administered with alcohol, (2) co-administered with other medicaments like sedatives, antidepressants, neuroleptics or morphine like substances, (3) driving under their influence, (4) using benzodiazepines non-therapeutically as drugs of abuse or in drug-facilitated crimes. For these reasons benzodiazepines are still studied and determined in a variety of biological materials. In this article, sample preparation techniques which have been applied in analysis of benzodiazepine drugs in biological samples have been reviewed and presented. The next part of the article is focused on a review of analytical methods which have been employed for pharmacological, toxicological or forensic study of this group of drugs in the biological matrices. The review was preceded by a description of the physicochemical properties of the selected benzodiazepines and two, very often coexisting in the same analyzed samples, sedative-hypnotic drugs.", 
    "223": "Anxiety is characterized by unpleasant bodily sensations, such as pounding heart and intense fear. The therapy involves the administration of benzodiazepine drugs. Purinergic signaling participates in the induction of several behavioral patterns and their actions are inactivated by ectonucleotidases and adenosine deaminase (ADA). Since there is evidence about the involvement of purinergic system in the actions mediated by benzodiazepines, we evaluated the effects in vitro and in vivo of administration of diazepam and midazolam on nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases, ecto-5'-nucleotidase, and ADA activities in zebrafish brain, followed by the analysis of gene expression pattern of these enzymes and adenosine receptors (A1, A2a1, A2a2, A2b). The in vitro studies demonstrated that diazepam decreased ATP (66 % for 500 \u00b5M) and ADP hydrolysis (40-54 % for 10-500 \u00b5M, respectively). Midazolam decreased ATP (16-71 % for 10-500 \u00b5M, respectively) and ADP (48-73.5 % for 250-500 \u00b5M, respectively) hydrolysis as well as the ecto-ADA activity (26-27.5 % for 10-500 \u00b5M, respectively). AMP hydrolysis was decreased in animals treated with of 0.5 and 1 mg/L midazolam (32 and 36 %, respectively). Diazepam and midazolam decreased the ecto-ADA activity at 1.25 mg/L and 1 mg/L (31 and 33 %, respectively), but only 0.1 mg/L midazolam induced an increase (40 %) in cytosolic ADA. The gene expression analysis demonstrated changes on ecto-5'-nucleotidase, A1, A2a1, A2a2, and A2b mRNA transcript levels after acute treatment with benzodiazepines. These findings demonstrated that benzodiazepine exposure induces a modulation of extracellular nucleotide and nucleoside metabolism, suggesting the purinergic signaling may be, at least in part, related to benzodiazepine effects."
