    "0": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor represents an elementary switching mechanism integral to the functioning of the central nervous system and a locus for the action of many mood- and emotion-altering agents such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, and alcohol. Anxiety, sleep disorders, and convulsive disorders have been effectively treated with therapeutic agents that enhance the action of GABA at the GABAA receptor or increase the concentration of GABA in nervous tissue. The GABAA receptor is a multimeric membrane-spanning ligand-gated ion channel that admits chloride upon binding of the neurotransmitter GABA and is modulated by many endogenous and therapeutically important agents. Since GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, modulation of its response has profound implications for brain functioning. The GABAA receptor is virtually the only site of action for the centrally acting benzodiazepines, the most widely prescribed of the anti-anxiety medications. Increasing evidence points to an important role for GABA in epilepsy and various neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent advances in molecular biology and complementary information derived from pharmacology, biochemistry, electrophysiology, anatomy and cell biology, and behavior have led to a phenomenal growth in our understanding of the structure, function, regulation, and evolution of the GABAA receptor. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, polyvalent cations, and ethanol act as positive or negative modulators of receptor function. The description of a receptor gene superfamily comprising the subunits of the GABAA, nicotinic acetylcholine, and glycine receptors has led to a new way of thinking about gene expression and receptor assembly in the nervous system. Seventeen genetically distinct subunit subtypes (alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 4, gamma 1-gamma 4, delta, p1-p2) and alternatively spliced variants contribute to the molecular architecture of the GABAA receptor. Mysteriously, certain preferred combinations of subunits, most notably the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 arrangement, are widely codistributed, while the expression of other subunits, such as beta 1 or alpha 6, is severely restricted to specific neurons in the hippocampal formation or cerebellar cortex. Nervous tissue has the capacity to exert control over receptor number, allosteric uncoupling, subunit mRNA levels, and posttranslational modifications through cellular signal transduction mechanisms under active investigation. The genomic organization of the GABAA receptor genes suggests that the present abundance of subtypes arose during evolution through the duplication and translocations of a primordial alpha-beta-gamma gene cluster. This review describes these varied aspects of GABAA receptor research with special emphasis on contemporary cellular and molecular discoveries.", 
    "1": "The taste reactivity (TR) test was devised as a method to obtain behavioural data in response to gustatory stimuli in neurologically impaired rats, incapable of voluntary feeding. Sapid solutions were infused through surgically implanted intraoral cannulae. Facial and motor responses corresponded well to known hedonic and aversive properties of tastes (e.g., sweet, bitter). TR testing has since proved effective as an adjunct to intake-based methods, in the psychopharmacology of ingestion in the normal rat. We developed a nonsurgical modification of the TR test, in which intact rats sampled stimuli voluntarily. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (3.0 mg/kg, IP) was administered to rats first trained to consume a sweet 3% sucrose solution, and later tested with access to a bitter 0.01% quinine solution. Response were videotaped, and TR measures were scored during periods of noningestion using a frame-by-frame playback. Treatment increased ingestion and facilitated ingestive responses in accordance with published data for cannulated rats. Results support a two-component view of response palatability, in which treatment alters feeding motivation, increasing positive palatability and facilitating ingestion of both palatable and unpalatable stimuli.", 
    "2": "Three cases of multiple false-positive drug tests are described. Postmortem urine specimens were screened using the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique. All patients had proteinuria and lactic aciduria. These false-positive reactions were due to the presence of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lactic acid, and protein. This finding was confirmed by creating a multiple false-positive sample with a solution of LDH and lactate in 5% bovine serum albumin at pH 6.", 
    "3": "A gas chromatographic method using nitrogen-phosphorus detection was developed to quantitate clozapine in plasma or serum. Methyl clonazepam was used as an internal standard. Sample preparation included a single-step extraction with ethyl acetate, which was injected directly onto a wide-bore capillary column. Within-run and total precision, measured as percent coefficient of variation, were determined at low, therapeutic, and high clozapine plasma concentrations. The within-run precision for the low, therapeutic, and high clozapine plasma samples was 5.2, 2.7, and 2.4%, respectively. The total precision for the low, therapeutic, and high clozapine plasma samples was 10.0, 2.6, and 2.0%, respectively. Analytical accuracy was evaluated by comparing quantitative results with those obtained from a reference laboratory. Those samples containing therapeutic or high concentrations agreed within 3%; the sample containing a subtherapeutic concentration differed by 11.9%. The limit of quantitation was determined to be 35 ng/mL, and the upper limit of linearity was 3000 ng/mL. No significant interferences were detected after testing more than two dozen drugs and metabolites.", 
    "4": "This study involves a review of 178 patients on a strictly monitored methadone maintenance programme. All patients had a minimum of 9 years of intravenous drug misuse. 35.7% were HIV positive, 55.7% males and 29% females had previous prison sentences. On average patients had undergone 3.26 out-patient and 0.9 in-patient detoxification. 46.1% had attempted rehabilitation in the past. Out of 25,470 urine samples obtained while on the programme, 10.8% were positive for opiates, 19.2% for benzodiazepines, 32.5% for cannabis, 4.92% for alcohol and 2.27% for amphetamines. Long history of misuse, multiple custodial sentences, previous unsuccessful rehabilitation and positive HIV status were associated with acceptance for maintenance. Frequency of urinalysis, and results triggering dose change can effectively reduce illicit drug use.", 
    "5": "The present survey of controlled studies on the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) reveals that treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine and clomipramine), benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine) and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine has been proven effective. Among psychological therapies, cognitive therapy and exposure therapy in agoraphobia have been shown to be effective. There is an insufficient number of comparisons between pharmacological and psychological treatments. From the existing studies it can be assumed that none of these treatment modalities is superior to the other. The few existing follow-up studies do not suffice to prove a longer lasting effect for the psychological therapies, compared with drug therapies. Because of the low number of investigations, it cannot be clearly stated whether it is useful or harmful do treat patients with psychopharmacological drugs during psychological therapy. It is more likely that this combination is advantageous.", 
    "6": "To report a patient with a probable acute tubular necrosis (ATN) induced by chronic exposure to polyethylene glycol (PEG)-400 via long-term, massive dosage of intravenous lorazepam.", 
    "7": "A 57-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute respiratory failure. Lorazepam therapy was initiated in anticipation of alcohol withdrawal. Dosages up to 18 mg/h were required to provide adequate sedation and optimize ventilation. On day 43, the patient developed oliguric ATN of unknown etiology. The cumulative intravenous lorazepam dose was 4089 mg, equivalent to approximately 220 mL of PEG-400. Blood urea nitrogen concentrations followed a pattern that paralleled lorazepam dosage increases and decreases. Protein and granular casts were evident in urinalyses performed on days 12 and 29. The patient eventually experienced complete recovery.", 
    "8": "ATN associated with intravenous PEG was last reported in 1959 in 6 of 32 patients receiving a cumulative PEG-300 dose of 120-200 mL over 3-5 days via an intravenous nitrofurantoin preparation. Two of the 6 patients died. Chronic administration of intravenous PEG to rabbits over a 5-week period has caused cloudy swelling of the renal tubular epithelium, increased blood urea concentrations, and death in some animals.", 
    "9": "ATN probably resulted from chronic PEG exposure via massive doses of lorazepam injection, possibly enhanced by concurrent administration of vancomycin.", 
    "10": "Benzodiazepines, the most widely prescribed psychotropic drugs, are often used in patients with depressive disorders, either alone or in combination with standard antidepressants. This review evaluates the efficacy of benzodiazepines (alprazolam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) as established in acute-phase, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in major depressive disorder. Metaanalyses using intent-to-treat, as well as adequate treatment exposure samples, revealed an overall efficacy of 47-63% and a drug-placebo difference of 0-27% for all benzodiazepines. Alprazolam, the best studied of the benzodiazepines, had a 27.1% (sd = 6.1%) greater response than placebo, which is comparable to standard antidepressants. Alprazolam, in particular, may be a useful treatment option for patients in whom standard antidepressant medications are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or possibly ineffective. Alprazolam may have a more rapid onset of action for some patients. Benzodiazepines do not primarily affect biogenic amine uptake or metabolism, although they do augment gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) activity. The antidepressant efficacy of benzodiazepines, which are GABAA receptor agonists, is consistent with the GABA theory of depression.", 
    "11": "Clinical records of all patients treated from 1983 to 1991 in a university clinic for lang-term-use of benzodiazepines were examined. Daily intake of benzodiazepines began in 80% immediately after the first prescription. At the time of admission, 34% reported intake of more than 3 DDD, i.e. more than 30 mg of diazepam. In patients 70%, additional abuse of alcohol and/or other psychotropic substances was established. Benzodiazepines were the first substances abused in 49%. The diagnosis of abuse or dependency was made in 65% before admission. Symptoms of organic brain syndrome were described in 30% of all records. Symptom leading to first benzodiazepine intake were somatic complaints (40%), depressed mood (39%), insomnia (37% and anxiety (24%). Between first intake and admission, there was a significant increase in patients with somatic complaints, depressed mood and anxiety. After detocification, symptoms leading to admission improved in 80% of all patients.", 
    "12": "There is no standard therapy in the management of postoperative pain control following corrective cardiac surgery of congenital heart disease. Assessment in the preverbal age is difficult. In a randomized study we compared a combined treatment of fentanyl and midazolam, given as continuous infusion versus single dose application. A pain assessment score was used to measure the effectiveness of analgosedation in addition to recording nurseries observations. Fentanyl and midazolam are an appropriate combination for postoperative pain treatment. Continuous application is considered to be more effective concerning basic anxiety, cumulative dosage and to avoid volume overload in infants and young children, following cardiac surgery; overdosage was not observed.", 
    "13": "The purpose of this study was to implement an empirical assessment of the clinical response to standard alcohol detoxification during withdrawal from both alcohol and cocaine. One hundred forty-nine males consecutively admitted in acute alcohol withdrawal to a hospital-based detoxification unit were studied. All subjects completed a 4-day chlordiazepoxide detoxification. Patients who used drugs other than cocaine were excluded. Fifty-five subjects withdrawing only from alcohol and 94 subjects withdrawing from both alcohol and cocaine, as evidenced by positive urinalysis and history, were studied. Both groups reported similar amounts of daily alcohol intake and had a similar age of onset of alcohol dependence. Parental alcoholism was equally frequent in both groups. Statistically, several variables were directly related to severity of alcohol withdrawal, including associated cocaine abuse, age, abnormal laboratory values, and duration of homelessness. As measured by the Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (AWS), alcohol withdrawal was less severe among cocaine users, not only at intake but throughout the 4-day detoxification. Singly addicted alcoholics were older and had longer drinking histories, more prior detoxifications, and more abnormal laboratory values than cocaine users. A multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between cocaine and severity of alcohol withdrawal. Cocaine users more frequently requested reductions in chlordiazepoxide dosages than singly addicted alcoholics, complaining of dysphoria, sedation, and weakness. The severity of alcohol withdrawal was associated with recent cocaine use, age, laboratory abnormalities, and duration of homelessness. Concurrent cocaine withdrawal in the sample was associated with reduced severity of alcohol withdrawal. Possible neurobiological mechanisms, as well as study limitations affecting interpretation of the findings, are discussed. Tailored detoxification as opposed to standard detoxification regimens may be more appropriate for the clinical management of combined alcohol-cocaine withdrawal.", 
    "14": "The AMPA receptor has been shown to participate in the synaptic mechanisms involved in certain forms of learning and memory. We have previously demonstrated that the posttraining infusion of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor blocker, into the dorsal hippocampus of rats, causes retrograde amnesia of an inhibitory avoidance training. Here, we report on the effect of this learning task on 3[H]AMPA binding to frozen rat brain sections. By using a quantitative autoradiographic analysis, we were able to demonstrate that the binding of 3[H]-AMPA was increased by 40-80% in the CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampal formation of rats trained in a step-down inhibitory avoidance paradigm, compared to naive, shocked, and free exploration controls. This effect was evident between 30 and 180 min after training, and it was mainly due to an increase in the density, but not in the affinity of binding sites. No alterations in 3[H]AMPA binding were observed either in those animals that received only the footshock (shocked group) or in animals that were submitted to 1 min of free exploration of the training box (free exploration group). In the rest of the brain regions, including the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, striatum, amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus, the 3[H]AMPA binding remained unchanged. In addition, the binding of 3[H]muscimol and 3[H]-flunitrazepam to the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex was unaltered in all the experimental groups. In conclusion, rats submitted to a one-trial inhibitory avoidance training showed a rapid, selective, and specific increase in 3[H]AMPA binding in the hippocampal formation. The present findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal AMPA receptors are involved in the neural mechanisms underlying certain forms of learning and memory.", 
    "15": "The behavioral effects of two amnestic treatments (intraseptal chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and intraventricular AF64A) were examined in a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample radial-arm maze (DNMTS) paradigm. The types of errors induced by these treatments in this working memory task were assessed to determine how acute and chronic disruptions of the medial septum affect different phases of working memory (encoding, maintenance, retrieval). Rats were initially trained to perform the DNMTS task with a 1-h delay imposed between the training and the testing sessions. The first experiment demonstrated that intraseptal injection of 30 nmoles of CDP did not produce state-dependent learning. Rats were injected immediately following training with CDP or artificial cerobrospinal fluid (CSF; drug vehicle) and then prior to testing with CDP or CSF. Injection of CDP immediately following training (CDP-CSF) impaired performance of the task regardless of whether CDP was also administered before the postdelay test (CDP-CDP). Rats infused with CDP only before the postdelay test (CSF-CDP) exhibited a proactive deficit characterized by intact retention of the predelay information (i.e., arms entered prior to the delay) but impaired performance on the postdelay component (arms entered only after the delay). These data indicate: (i) that state dependency does not explain the working memory deficits induced by intraseptal CDP; (ii) that pretest CDP disrupts the storage and utilization of working memory for current arm selections. The second experiment examined the behavioral effects induced by a permanent disruption of the cholinergic septohippocampal pathway produced by icv injection of the cholinotoxin AF64A. Rats were initially trained on the DNMTS task and then bilaterally injected icv with either AF64A (2.5 nmoles/side) or CSF. AF64A-treated rats exhibited a significant impairment of performance compared to CSF-treated controls. In contrast to the impairment exhibited by CDP-treated rats in Experiment 1, the performance of AF64A-treated rats displayed a deficit in the maintenance/retrieval of information acquired during RAM training and an impairment in ability to store current spatial information in working memory to guide postdelay testing performance. These studies demonstrate that acute and chronic disruptions of the septohippocampal pathway produce distinct profiles of cognitive impairment that should help to reveal the behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of spatial memory.", 
    "16": "We report a 18 years old female with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome under treatment with sodium valproate, carbamazepine and clonazepam. When seizures increased we stopped carbamazepine and introduced lamotrigine slowly. One month later the girl developed haemorrhagic erosions in mucoses and limbs with deterioration of her general state. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of erythema multiforme, the Stevens-Johnson's form. The immediate withdrawal of lamotrigine and treatment with antihystaminics and steroids was followed of a slowly favourable course with disappearance of symptomatology one month later. It's another case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome related to the introduction of lamotrigine in polytherapy.", 
    "17": "Clinical, neurological, endoscopic, psychological findings, questionnaire data on vegetative sphere, diaphragm x-ray, articulation test and Viene test system evidence obtained on 25 patients with phonic spasm confirm organic neurological nature of spastic dysphonia as focal muscular dystonia. This condition can be accompanied with tremor, rotatory, winking and writers' spasms, oromandibular dystonia. As indicated by positive treatment outcomes, combined treatment of phonic spasm with GABA-ergic drugs of clonazepam (antelepsin) and baclofen, orthophonic voice correction, physiotherapy is pathogenetically justified.", 
    "18": "The present experiments examined the sensitivity of the elevated plus-maze to the effects of stressor controllability. Previous work had established that inescapable but not an equal amount of escapable electric tail shock reduced social interaction. The present experiments demonstrate that prior exposure to shock alters elevated plus-maze behavior, but that this effect is not sensitive to the escapability of the shock. These experiments include a replication of the usual pharmacologic effects of benzodiazepine ligands (2 mg/kg diazepam; 0.4 mg/kg methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) to demonstrate the sensitivity of the elevated plus-maze procedures used. The results provide additional support for the idea that the social interaction and elevated plus-maze measures of \"anxiety\" are sensitive to different processes.", 
    "19": "Recent clinical evidence suggests that the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine is effective against not only panic disorder but also generalized anxiety disorder. Although most animal models of anxiety appear to be insensitive to this agent, such work has almost invariably employed an acute treatment regimen. In the present study, ethological methods have been used to assess in detail the effects of acute and chronic imipramine treatment on the behaviour of male DBA/2 mice in the elevated plus-maze test. In contrast to acutely administered diazepam (1 mg/kg), which produced a significant anxiolytic profile on standard and ethological measures, neither acute nor chronic (daily, 15 days) treatment with imipramine (0-20 mg/kg) was associated with anxiety reduction. Data are discussed in relation to test sensitivity factors and the nonspecific mechanism of action of imipramine.", 
    "20": "Recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the C57BL/6J and A/J mouse strains were used for behavioral studies designed to estimate the number and location of chromosomal loci responsible for anxiety-related behaviors and differential sensitivity to agonists and inverse agonists of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA)/benzodiazepine receptor complex. The phenotypes of the parental inbred strains and of 28 RI strains were characterized for the number of transitions in the light<-->dark exploratory model, anxiolytic response to diazepam, vertical and ambulatory activities in an open field, and sensitivity to the convulsant properties of methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM). The strain distribution patterns and estimates of the minimal number of loci obtained for each trait suggest that multiple chromosomal loci contribute to differences in anxiety-related behavioral phenotypes and the behavioral responses to diazepam and beta-CCM between C57BL/6J and A/J mice. The best probabilities of linkage were found between the variables characterizing response to diazepam and loci on chromosomes 1 (Xmv-41) and 10 (D10Mit2) and between the sensitivity to the convulsant actions of beta-CCM and locus D15Mit5 on chromosome 15.", 
    "21": "Sixty children aged 3 to 9, undergoing minor surgical procedures, were studied to compare 0.5 mg/kg intranasal with 0.5 mg/kg rectal midazolam as a premedication. The children were evaluated for their ability to tolerate the medication, preanesthetic sedation, and alertness after anesthesia. Both premedication routes were equally effective in sedating the children. In both groups, a significant loss of effectiveness was noted if induction of the anesthesia began more than 30 minutes after administration of the medication (p < 0.0003). Rectal midazolam was much better tolerated by the children than the intranasal route (30 versus 3, p < 0.0001). We advocate the rectal over the intranasal route for premedication with midazolam in children, and anesthetic induction should occur no more than 30 minutes after administration of premedication.", 
    "22": "We demonstrated previously in ad libitum fed and fasted rats that chymotrypsinogen and amylase secretions were weakly or not at all correlated (1). However, the mechanisms controlling these correlations remain undetermined. We investigated the influences of cholinergic and cholecystokinin-related systems on the relationship between amylase and chymotrypsinogen in rats. Animals provided with pancreatic, biliary, duodenal, and jugular vein cannulas were kept in restraint cages under controlled temperature and humidity, with a regular 12-h light cycle, and divided into five groups. The first group of fed rats was constantly infused with 200 micrograms kg-1 h-1 atropine, the second with 0.5 mg kg-1 h-1 MK329, and the third with both. In the group in which both drugs were simultaneously infused, 500 micrograms kg-1 h-1 atropine was intraperitoneally administered, whereas MK329 was infused by intravenous cannula. Two groups consisted of fasted rats, of which one was also atropinized (100 micrograms kg-1 h-1). Three-day experiments were performed separately with fed rats, and 2-day experiments with fasted rats; atropine and/or MK329 infusion was constant over 48 h, in both fed and fasted rats. Atropine alone did not alter the correlation between enzymes even though the total protein and amylase outputs decreased, whereas the chymotrypsinogen output increased; MK329, slowly but significantly, increased the correlation between enzymes, whereas it decreased the outputs for all secretory parameters. When both antagonists were simultaneously infused in fed rats, correlation coefficients between amylase and chymotrypsinogen rapidly and markedly increased. In fasted rats, atropine infusion induced a tremendous decrease in total protein and amylase mean outputs but a significant increase in chymotrypsinogen output, without any significant change in the correlation between both enzymes. These results indicate that the nonparallel secretion of amylase and chymotrypsinogen is strongly modulated by a cholecystokinin-dependent mechanism and that this modulatory process is potentiated by the parasympathetic system.", 
    "23": "A 40-year-old Taiwanese farmer developed progressive stiffness and pain in the lower back with intermittent cramps over a 3-year period. The cramps were extremely painful and the patient was sensitive to any sudden movement or external stimulation. His lower back was so stiff that the patient had great difficulty performing daily activities and walked with a rigid and straight back. The stiffness of the muscles subsided during normal sleep. Except for a left S1 radiculopathy, no other neurologic abnormalities were noted. Electromyography showed spontaneous continuous muscle fiber activity which was markedly suppressed after a trial with 20 mg intravenous diazepam. The muscular stiffness disappeared during treatment with oral diazepam 80 mg daily, which was tapered to 15 mg daily without any recurrence of spasm for 20 months. This is the first report of stiff-man syndrome in a Taiwanese patient and emphasizes the importance of recognizing this treatable disease.", 
    "24": "A peak of first episodes of schizophrenia can occur in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, tardive dyskinesia is more common in postmenopausal women than in men of comparable age. This study investigated the effect of ovariectomy (2 weeks or 3 months) in rats as a model of decreased gonadal function associated with menopause. After ovariectomy, frontal cortex D1 receptors progressively decreased in density with no change of affinity over time. Striatal D1 and D2 receptors also had decreased density after ovariectomy with no change of affinity. In the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a progressive increase in [3H]flunitrazepam-specific binding associated with GABAA receptors was observed as a function of time following ovariectomy. It is hypothesized that low prefrontal cortex dopamine activity has implications in negative symptoms of schizophrenia and, furthermore, that GABAergic overactivity in the internal globus pallidus-substantia nigra pars reticulata complex plays a role in tardive dyskinesia. The present results suggest that, by reducing brain dopamine receptors and increasing GABAA receptors, gonadal hormone withdrawal may predispose to schizophrenia and dyskinesia.", 
    "25": "Previous studies examining the functional status of cortical muscarinic cholinergic M1 receptors have demonstrated an impairment in receptor-G protein coupling in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the inability of the receptor to form a high affinity agonist binding site. In order to investigate whether this alteration was a global phenomenon or a regional specific defect in signal transduction, we examined agonist binding at M1 receptors in three brain areas (superior frontal cortex, Brodmann areas 8 and 9; primary visual cortex, Brodmann area 17; and the dorsal striatum) within the same brain in controls and moderate to severe AD cases. Competition binding studies using the M1 antagonist 3H-pirenzepine (4 nM) in the presence of varying concentrations of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (50 nM to 1 mM) were performed in the presence and absence of GppNHp (100 microM), a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. In control membrane preparations, computer-assisted analysis of antagonist-agonist competition curves revealed that M1 receptor agonist binding fit a two site model with high and low affinity states in all three brain areas in the absence of GppNHp but only a single site in the presence of GppNHp. This is consistent with the ternary complex model of G protein-linked receptors. In contrast, curves obtained from both cortical regions from AD brains fit a single site model with low affinity in the presence or absence of GppNHp. On the other hand, agonist binding data obtained from the dorsal striatum of AD cases exhibited a two site fit, similar to that seen in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "GABAA receptors were characterized in cellular fractions isolated from adult bovine brain. The fraction enriched in cortical astrocytes is very rich in high-affinity binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam and other \"central-type\" benzodiazepine ligands. The amount of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding was more than five times higher in the glial fraction than in synaptosomal and perikaryal fractions. [3H]Flunitrazepam was displaced by low concentrations of clonazepam and other specific ligands for central GABAA receptors. Specific binding sites for GABA, flunitrazepam, barbiturates, and picrotoxin-like convulsants were characterized. Allosteric interactions between the different sites were typical of central-type GABAA receptors. The presence of alpha-subunit(s), as revealed by [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeling, was demonstrated in all brain fractions at molecular mas 51-53 kDa. Photoaffinity labeling was highest in the glial fraction. However, in primary cultured astrocytes from neonate rat cortex, no photoaffinity labeling was detected. Information obtained from astrocytes in culture should thus be taken with caution when extrapolated to differentiated astroglial cells. Our results actually show that, in mature brain, most of the fully pharmacologically active GABAA receptors are extrasynaptic and expressed in astroglia.", 
    "27": "To critically assess and summarize the beneficial effects of benzodiazepine therapy for insomnia in community-dwelling elders, a systematic search was undertaken to review all published clinical trials and sleep laboratory studies. The risk of injury for benzodiazepine users was also reviewed. Ten studies met inclusion criteria for assessing benefit. There are no studies regarding the long-term effectiveness of benzodiazepines for the treatment of sleep disorders in the elderly. In the sleep laboratory setting, triazolam 0.125 mg, flurazepam 15 mg, and estazolam 1 mg improved sleep latency by 27 to 30 minutes and increased total sleep time by 47 to 81 minutes for the first 2 to 3 nights of treatment, compared with baseline measurements taken while the patients were receiving placebo. In contrast to these modest short-term benefits, there is an association between the use of benzodiazepines with a long half-life, eg, flurazepam, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide, and an increased risk of hip fracture in the elderly. Triazolam can cause rebound insomnia as well as anterograde amnesia. Clinicians should discontinue their prescribing of long-acting benzodiazepines for elderly patients with insomnia. More research is needed on the effects of nondrug interventions as well as on short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam and temazepam, to treat insomnia in community-dwelling elderly.", 
    "28": "Treatment of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in changes in the abundance of a number of prenylated proteins. The most significant change involved a protein of 65 kd (p65) that became one of the most abundant prenylated proteins following treatment. The 65-kd protein was induced by agents that stimulate macrophage activation (IFNs or LPS) but not by cytokines that promote macrophage proliferation, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), M-CSF, or interleukin-3. The majority of p65 was localized to subcellular fractions containing internal and plasma membranes but was not detected in nuclear membranes. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor BZA-5B caused a dramatic decrease in p65 prenylation, suggesting that this protein may be modified by the C15 isoprenoid farnesyl. These observations provide the first direct evidence that interferons and LPS cause changes in the abundance of specific isoprenoid-modified proteins in macrophages.",

The primary adverse effect of Ro 24-7429 was rash, which necessitated treatment discontinuation in 6 of 71 patients. Nucleoside analogue treatment produced an average increase in CD4 cell count of 28 cells/mm3 at week 8 versus a decrease of 27 cells/mm3 in recipients of Ro 24-7429 (P < .001). Serum HIV p24 antigen levels decreased by an average of 111 pg/mL in nucleoside recipients at week 8 compared with an increase of 41 pg/mL in recipients of Ro 24-7429 (P = .007). Nucleoside-treated patients had a mean 0.66 log10 reduction in infectious peripheral blood mononuclear cells, while Ro 24-7429 recipients had a mean 0.02 log10 reduction (P = .02). No dose-response relationships were observed in the Ro 24-7429 groups. In this study, Ro 24-7429 treatment showed no evidence of antiviral activity.",

    "33": "We conclude that midazolam, fentanyl, and alfentanil are found in FF after a single IV dose, but further investigation needs to be undertaken to investigate any potential influence on fertilization and implantation rates.", 
    "34": "The effect of propofol was studied in 11 patients who had common bile duct sphincter of Oddi manometry for suspected dysfunction. Patients were initially sedated with midazolam and then further or resedated with propofol for the second set of pressure measurements. Recordings were made about 10 min after giving each drug. No patient had elevated basal pressure initially. Average basal pressure was unchanged (16.7 +/- 16.4 mm Hg), phasic contraction frequency was unchanged (3.4 +/- 3.8/min), and phasic contraction amplitude fell but did not achieve statistical significance (91.8 +/- 77.3 mm Hg, P = 0.1). There was no difference in lowest blood pressure, pulse, or oxygen saturation recorded during midazolam or propofol sedation. Subjectively, the patients were more sedated during propofol administration. It is concluded that propofol is a safe and effective agent for conscious sedation. It does not alter the sphincter of Oddi pressure profile in patients with normal basal sphincter pressures and thus could be used as an alternative and perhaps better form of sedation for ERCP with sphincter of Oddi manometry.", 
    "35": "The purpose of this study was to model pharmacodynamically the reversal of midazolam sedation with flumazenil. Ten human volunteers underwent four different sessions. In session 1, individual midazolam pharmacokinetics and electroencephalographic pharmacodynamics were determined. In sessions 2 and 3, a computer-controlled infusion of midazolam with individual volunteer pharmacokinetic data was administered, targeting a plasma concentration corresponding to a light or deep level of sedation (20% or 80% of the maximal midazolam electroencephalographic effect) for a period of 210 minutes. After obtaining a stable electroencephalographic effect and constant midazolam plasma concentrations, a zero-order infusion of flumazenil was started until complete reversal of midazolam electroencephalographic effect was obtained. The flumazenil infusion was then stopped and the volunteer was allowed to resedate because of the constant midazolam drug effect. The electroencephalographic response was measured during a 180-minute period and analyzed by aperiodic analysis and fast-Fourier transforms. In session 4, a midazolam plasma concentration corresponding to a deep level of sedation was targeted for 210 minutes to examine for the possible development of acute tolerance. No flumazenil was given in session 4. For a light sedation level, with a mean midazolam plasma concentration of 160 +/- 64 ng/ml, the mean half-life of the equilibration rate constant of flumazenil reversal is 5.0 +/- 2.5 minutes, and the mean effect site concentration causing 50% of Emax is 13.7 +/- 5.8 ng/ml. For a deep level of sedation, with a mean midazolam plasma concentration of 551 +/- 196 ng/ml, the mean half-life of the equilibration rate constant is 3.9 +/- 1.5 minutes, and the mean effect site concentration causing 50% of Emax is 20.6 +/- 6.8 ng/ml. This study provides an estimate of the magnitude of the blood/central nervous system equilibration delay for flumazenil antagonism of midazolam sedation and further defines the usefulness of the electroencephalogram as a measure of midazolam pharmacodynamic effect.", 
    "36": "Benzodiazepines have compiled an impressive record of safety and efficacy. Despite this record, however, physicians and laypersons frequently worry about the drugs' addictive potential. Overemphasizing these concerns may discourage prescription of benzodiazepines, thereby impeding treatment of anxiety disorders. This review first defines the term addiction. It then examines how frequently conditions meeting that definition occur in patients without histories of substance abuse, who are prescribed benzodiazepines under medical supervision. In such patients, benzodiazepines almost never induce behavior that satisfies any reasonable definition of addiction.", 
    "37": "We have studied in eight rabbits the cardiovascular effects of midazolam, propofol and alfentanil with graded hypoxia. Central blood volume was reduced progressively by gradual inflation of a thoracic vena cava cuff so that cardiac index (CI) decreased at a constant rate. Under control conditions the haemodynamic response was biphasic. During phase I, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained by a progressive decrease in systemic vascular conductance (SVCI). When CI had declined to a critical level, phase II occurred with an abrupt increase in SVCI and decrease in MAP. Phase I was prolonged by hypoxia, alfentanil and midazolam, but the effects were not additive. Phase I was shortened by propofol and this effect increased with hypoxia. The gradient of the SVCI response in phase I was also reduced by propofol > midazolam, but not by alfentanil. The occurrence of phase II was less frequent during alfentanil infusion than midazolam and propofol with all of the inspired gas mixtures. Thus the opioid was protective against circulatory collapse with hypoxia and simulated hypovalaemia.",

    "40": "Superfusion with thioperamide (H3 antagonist) increased somatostatin and decreased gastrin and histamine secretion in all three species; superfusion with (r)-alpha-methylhistamine (H3 agonist) had the opposite effect. The pattern implied that endogenous histamine, acting via H3 receptors, exerts an inhibitory paracrine influence on somatostatin secretion, which in turn regulates gastrin secretion. Superfusion with somatostatin antibody increased histamine secretion; the increase was not affected by the gastrin antagonist L-365,260, implying that it was not mediated by the concurrent increase in gastrin but by suppression of an inhibitory pathway linking somatostatin and histamine. Superfusion with methacholine alone and in the presence of either the H3 agonist or antagonist confirmed the existence of reciprocal inhibitory pathways linking somatostatin and histamine.",

    "42": "Female rats were treated orally for 13 wk with YM022 (300 mumol.kg-1.day-1) and with omeprazole (400 mumol.kg-1.day-1) or famotidine (900 mumol.kg-1.day-1) with or without YM022. At 2 h after the last dose, YM022 and omeprazole markedly inhibited basal and pentagastrin-induced acid secretion. Famotidine was less potent than YM022 and omeprazole against both secretions. The degree of increase in plasma gastrin level in the three groups was parallel to the antisecretory potencies of the drugs. At 14 days after the cessation of omeprazole treatment, the secretory response to pentagastrin increased above that of the control. This hyperresponse lasted for > or = 56 days. In the famotidine-treated group, a small increase in secretory response to pentagastrin was observed but was not statistically significant. The increase in secretory response to pentagastrin was paralleled by an increase in mucosal cell mass. In contrast, YM022 not only exhibited a long-lasting inhibition of pentagastrin-induced acid secretion but also prevented the hyperresponse to pentagastrin caused by omeprazole. These results indicate that the hypergastrinemia caused by long-term administration of antisecretory drugs increases mucosal secretory response to pentagastrin through a gastrin/cholecystokinin B receptor-mediated pathway in rats.",

Cardiovascular effects > 20% were more frequent with atracurium (37%) than with vecuronium (13%, P < 0.05). The incidence of noncardiovascular adverse events (increase in peak airway pressure > 5 cmH2O, tidal volume decrease > 10%, rashes, and wheezing) did not differ between atracurium (17%) and vecuronium (7%). The largest increase in peak airway pressure was 5.1 cmH2O in a patient whose tidal volume decreased 16% with vecuronium; in the remaining patients, tidal volume decreased < 10%. No patients experienced inspiratory wheezing, marked decreases in arterial oxygen saturation, or marked increases in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension.",

To determine the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, the effects of midazolam on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and tension in airway smooth muscles were investigated.", 
    "48": "Using front-surface fluorometry and fura-2-loaded porcine tracheal smooth muscle strips, both [Ca2+]i and isometric tension developments were simultaneously recorded.", 
    "49": "When the tracheal strips were exposed to a high external K(+)-solution (40 mM) or 10(-7) M carbachol containing 1.25 mM Ca2+, both [Ca2+]i and tension increased rapidly until they reached a plateau (the steady state). During steady-state contraction induced by K(+)-depolarization or carbachol, the cumulative application of midazolam (10(-7) approximately 10(-4) M) caused decreases in both [Ca2+]i and tension, in a concentration-dependent manner. During 40 mM K(+)-induced depolarization, the stepwise increases in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration induced the stepwise increases in [Ca2+]i and tension. Midazolam (3 x 10(-5) M) inhibited these increases in [Ca2+]i and tension, but had no effect on the [Ca2+]i-tension relationship. In the presence of 3 x 10(-3) M NiCl2 (a nonselective cation channel blocker), midazolam (3 x 10(-5) M) did not cause any additional reduction of [Ca2+]i or tension during the contraction induced by carbachol (10(-7) M). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, midazolam (3 x 10(-5) M) had no effect on the transient increases in either [Ca2+]i or the tension induced by carbachol (10(-7) M) or caffeine (20 mM). Pretreatment with both 10(-5) M flumazenil (a specific central antagonist of benzodiazepines) and 10(-5) M PK11195 (a specific peripheral antagonist of benzodiazepines) did not influence the effect of 10(-5) M midazolam on [Ca2+]i or tension during the contractions induced by carbachol.", 
    "50": "Midazolam directly relaxes airway smooth muscles by decreasing [Ca2+]i; this can be attributed to the inhibition of the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Midazolam has no effect on the release of stored Ca2+. In addition, midazolam has no effect on Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. Finally, benzodiazepine antagonists, flumazenil and PK11195, have no effect on this mechanism of direct action of midazolam on airway smooth muscles.", 
    "51": "We examined the actions of cyclothiazide, aniracetam, and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI-52466) on recombinant alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and kainate receptors. Receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes or human embryonic kidney 293 cells were characterized using voltage and patch-clamp electrophysiology. Aniracetam and cyclothiazide potentiated AMPA receptor currents by slowing or blocking desensitization. Cyclothiazide was more potent at receptors consisting of flip subunits compared with receptors consisting of flop subunits, whereas aniracetam appeared to be more efficacious at flop receptors. The potency of GYKI-52466 did not differ in heteromeric flip or flop containing AMPA receptors, but GYKI-52466 was less potent at homomeric GluRAi and GluRDi receptors. At heteromeric AMPA receptors, 50 microM cyclothiazide increased the IC50 value for GYKI-52466 significantly. The increase was largest in GluRBi/Di receptors where the IC50 value shifted from 21.9 microM (95% confidence interval, 12.0-39.8 microM) to 126 microM (95% confidence interval, 72.4-214 microM) in the presence of cyclothiazide. In contrast, 100 microM GYKI-52466 did not alter the EC50 of cyclothiazide at GluRBi/Di receptors nor did it markedly change the maximal potentiation induced by cyclothiazide. At GluRBi/Di receptors transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, 30 microM GYKI-52466 inhibited the steady state and the peak current evoked by 300 microns L-glutamate to the same extent (34.5 +/- 12% and 27.3 +/- 13.0%, respectively; five experiments), and GYKI-52466 did not alter the apparent rate of desensitization (tau = 15.7 +/- 4.7 and 17.5 +/- 8.3 msec in the absence and presence of GYKI-52466, respectively; five experiments). GYKI-52466 inhibited L-glutamate currents in the presence and absence of 10 microM cyclothiazide, but GYKI-52466 never restored the desensitization that was blocked by cyclothiazide. Furthermore, GYKI-52466 inhibited L-glutamate currents mediated by homomeric Glu6 receptors, which are not potentiated by cyclothiazide. Our data suggest that the effect of cyclothiazide on the affinity of GYKI-52466 for its binding site is allosteric and that the positive modulatory effect of cyclothiazide and the negative modulatory effect of GYKI-52466 result from binding to separate sites on recombinant subunits.", 
    "52": "The effect of chronic 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha-ol-20-one (5 alpha 3 alpha; neurosteroid) treatment was investigated on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5 alpha 3 alpha, and ligands that bind to the benzodiazepine (BZ) site on GABA-induced [36Cl-]influx in intact cultured mammalian cortical neurons. Chronic 5 alpha 3 alpha treatment (1 microM; 5 days) decreased the efficacy of GABA, because its Emax (maximal response) value was decreased, whereas the EC50 (potency) value was not altered. Chronic 5 alpha 3 alpha treatment also decreased the Emax value of BZ agonists like diazepam to potentiate GABA-induced [36Cl-] influx, and decreased the -Emax (maximal inhibitory response) value of inverse agonists like methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3'-carboxylate to inhibit GABA-induced [36Cl-] influx, whereas not altering their EC50/IC50 values. Furthermore, chronic 5 alpha 3 alpha treatment decreased the Emax value of 5 alpha 3 alpha to potentiate GABA-induced [36Cl-] influx, without altering its EC50 value. The decreased efficacy of GABA and 5 alpha 3 alpha were reversed by concomitant exposure of the neurons to R 5135 (3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5 beta-17-androstan-11-one; a competitive GABA antagonist). Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic 5 alpha 3 alpha treatment produces decreased efficacy of GABA, ligands that bind to the BZ site, and neurosteroids at the GABAA-BZ receptor complex. The decreased efficacy is heterologous in nature and involves mediation via the GABAA receptor site.", 
    "53": "U-90042 is a structurally novel compound that has comparable affinities for binding to three recombinant subtypes of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor: alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2. The relatively high affinity for the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype is similar to the benzodiazepine (BZ) partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 and different from BZ sedative/hypnotics such as diazepam and zolpidem. In the present study, U-90042 (3 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed locomotor activity and impaired rotarod performance in mice. These effects were not antagonized by flumazenil. The sedative effect was further confirmed in rats (10 mg/kg i.p.) and monkeys (1 mg/kg p.o.) by an increase of behavioral sleep and a corresponding electroencephalographic frequency spectral shift. Unlike the BZ hypnotics, U-90042 (10 mg/kg i.p.) produced no amnesia in the one-trial passive avoidance response in mice but antagonized diazepam-induced amnesia. In rats trained to discriminate an injection of diazepam from saline, U-90042 produced predominantly vehicle-appropriate responses, even at depressant doses. The in vivo diazepam-antagonist effect of U-90042 is consistent with its low intrinsic activity and diazepam-antagonism at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor subtypes. The receptor mechanism for the sedative/hypnotic effect is not clear at this time.", 
    "54": "The use of benzodiazepines (BDZs) in the long-term treatment of epilepsy is greatly restricted by their capacity to induce tolerance and dependence. Thus, the development of new BDZ-related therapeutic agents should be directed by strategies that minimize tolerance- and dependence-inducing properties. Experimental procedures used to determine the success of such strategies often rely on a single assay procedure (e.g., one seizure model), which might lead to false predictions. Furthermore, the different types of tolerance, i.e., \"pharmacological\" (metabolic or functional) and \"behavioral\" (\"learned\" or \"contingent\"), are often not dealt with in such studies. This prompted us to compare the chronic anticonvulsant efficacy and withdrawal characteristics of diazepam and two novel BDZ receptor ligands, i.e., the partial agonist bretazenil and the subtype-selective agonist abecarnil, in different seizure models in mice. Myoclonic, clonic and tonic seizures were induced by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol and by transcorneal or transauricular application of electrical stimuli. Prolonged administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg twice daily for 6 days) resulted in marked anticonvulsant effects on myoclonic, clonic and tonic seizure thresholds at the onset of treatment, but pronounced tolerance developed rapidly during subsequent treatment. The time course and extent of tolerance was similar with most seizure models. Tolerance characteristics were not affected by study design, i.e., use of separate or the same animals for each seizure induction, indicating that learned or contingent tolerance was not significantly involved under these experimental conditions. After termination of treatment with diazepam, significant seizure threshold decreases were determined, indicating withdrawal hyperexcitability in response to physical dependence. During prolonged administration of abecarnil (10 mg/kg twice daily for 6 days), some anticonvulsant tolerance was seen with electroshock seizures, but not with pentylenetetrazol seizures; no withdrawal hyperexcitability was determined upon termination of treatment. Bretazenil (10 mg/kg twice daily for 6 days) produced no tolerance in any of the seizure models, but a significant decrease in electroshock seizure threshold was seen in the withdrawal period. The data indicate that tolerance and withdrawal characteristics of BDZ receptor partial and subtype-selective agonists in mice depend on the experimental model used, whereas the influence of the experimental protocol is less critical in the case of a full BDZ receptor agonist such as diazepam.", 
    "55": "GABAA receptors are ligand-gated CI- ion channels with multiple clinically relevant drug-recognition sites. We have previously shown that stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-specific glutamate receptors quantitatively alters selected GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs and proteins in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons. We used whole-cell recordings of GABA-elicited CI- currents and flunitrazepam binding experiments in granule cell cultures maintained in low K+ (12.5 mM), cells maintained in low K+ and treated with a single dose of NMDA (10 microM), and cell cultures maintained in depolarizing concentrations of K+ (25 mM). The EC50 obtained from the dose-response curves for GABA in eliciting a maximal response was comparable in neurons maintained in high K+ or in low K+ and treated with a single dose of NMDA, but that it increased significantly in cells maintained in low K+. The potentiation of GABA-gated CI- currents by flunitrazepam increased significantly, while the negative allosteric modulator methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) was significantly more effective in cultures either maintained in high K+ or treated with NMDA. This was coincident with a twofold increase in the Bmax associated with flunitrazepam binding. To further characterize the receptor assemblies present in the depolarization and NMDA induced paradigms, the Zn(2+)-induced inhibition of GABA-gated CI- currents was reduced as was the inhibition mediated by furosemide. Our data indicate that GABAA receptor assemblies alter their composition in response to excitatory afferent receptor stimulation.", 
    "56": "The National Institute of Forensic Toxicology in Oslo receives blood and urine samples from all Norwegian drivers apprehended on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In this study, sex differences in use of alcohol and drugs among Norwegian drunken and drugged drivers were presented. In 1992 and 1993, the institute received samples from 11,970 and 5642 suspected drunken and drugged drivers respectively. Women were underrepresented among both suspected drunken (7.6%) and drugged (10.9%) drivers. There were not observed dramatic gender differences in frequency and finding of drugs. The most frequent drugs in addition to alcohol were tetrahydrocannabinol, benzodiazepines and amphetamine. The data suggest that benzodiazepines are found relatively more often in blood from female than from male drugged drivers. Lower proportion of women with blood ethanol concentration over the legal limit was observed.", 
    "57": "We have previously shown that agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization in intestinal longitudinal muscle is mediated by ryanodine-sensitive, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive sacroplasmic Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ release via these channels is triggered by agonist-stimulated Ca2+ influx and results in Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. The present study examined whether cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is synthesized in response to stimulation of longitudinal muscle by agonists and modulates the activity of Ca2+ release channels. Cyclic ADPR bound with high affinity to dispersed longitudinal muscle cells (IC50 1.9nM) and induced Ca2+ release (EC50 3.8 nM), increase in [Ca2+]i (EC50 2.0 nM), and contraction (EC50 1.1 nM); cADPR had no effect on circular muscle cells. The effects of cADPR were blocked by ruthenium red, dantrolene, and the specific antagonist, 8-amino-cADPR, and were augmented by caffeine but not affected by heparin. The binding of cADPR and its ability to stimulate Ca2+ release were dependent on the concentration of Ca2+. Cyclic ADPR was capable of stimulating Ca2+ release at subthreshold Ca2+ concentrations (25-100 nM) and of enhancing Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. Longitudinal muscle extracts incubated with beta-NAD+ produced a time-dependent increase in Ca(2+)-mobilizing activity identified as authentic cADPR by blockade of Ca2+ release with 8-amino-cADPR and ruthenium red. Ca2+ mobilizing activity was increased by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) in a concentration-dependent fashion. The increase induced by CCK-8 was suppressed by the CCK-A antagonist, L364,718, nifedipine, and guanyl-5'-yl thiophosphate. The study shows that ADP-ribosyl cyclase can be stimulated by agonists and that cADPR can act as an endogenous modulator of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release.", 
    "58": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-residue polypeptide produced abundantly in both nervous and peripheral tissues, appears to play a significant role in the regulation of diverse biological processes, including feeding behavior and cardiovascular and psychotropic functions. The actions of NPY are mediated through effective binding to specific receptors of which two, designated Y1 and Y2, have been well characterized. A shortened cyclic analogue of NPY, des-AA10-17-cyclo-7/21[Cys7,21]NPY, was shown to retain high affinity for both human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC and SK-N-BE2 cell types (expressing Y1 and Y2 receptors, respectively). Increasing the size of the ring (des-AA10-17-cyclo-2/27[Cys2,27]NPY) in the present study produced a high-affinity analogue (Ki = 3.0 vs 0.3 nM for NPY) that bound exclusively to Y2 receptors. Using the feedback from structure-activity relationships, we also describe the optimization of specific substitutions and bridging arrangements leading to the production of other truncated, high-affinity Y1 selective analogues which bind, as does NPY itself, in the low-nanomolar range. Of greatest significance, des-AA10-17-cyclo-7/21[Cys7,21,Pro34]NPY (11) was found to possess agonistic properties with an affinity comparable to that of the native NPY molecule when tested for its ability to inhibit norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP release in SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells. Compound 11 also caused an increase in blood pressure in anesthetized rats. However, in two central nervous system models of Y1 receptor function, stimulation of feeding and anxiolytic activity, this analogue was inactive, which suggests the presence of a new subclass of receptors. In summary, the present results demonstrate that residues 10-17 of NPY are not directly involved in either Y1 or Y2 receptor recognition or activation. This suggests that the selectivity of NPY receptors is highly dependent on subtle conformational changes such as the substitution of residue 34 to a proline or the introduction of intramolecular constraints. Additionally, we have produced an analogue of NPY that selectively activates peripheral NPY Y1 receptors.", 
    "59": "We found that a variety of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor ligands bind to bovine serum albumin (BSA). This binding was rapid, fully reversible, temperature independent, of low affinity, and specific for BSA; it depended on the concentration of BSA, the chemical structure of the ligand, and the chemical composition of the incubation medium. BSA also decreased the binding of 125I-labeled CCK octapeptide (125I-CCK-8) to CCK receptors on pancreatic acini and membranes but increased the potency with which CCK-8 inhibited binding of 125I-CCK-8. These counterintuitive findings appeared to result from BSA altering the affinities of CCK-8 for different affinity states of the pancreatic CCK receptor. An alternate hypothesis is that BSA increased the efficacy of CCK-8 such that it bound to receptors and also caused biochemical changes in other receptors that reduced their ability to bind 125I-CCK-8. BSA enhanced the ability of CCK-8 to stimulate amylase secretion from pancreatic acini and to cause contraction of dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells. Thus, CCK can bind to BSA, and the BSA-CCK complex has substantially different activities from the free, uncomplexed hormone.", 
    "60": "The developmental time-course of type I and type II benzodiazepine receptors in the chick optic lobe was determined using a triazolopyridazine, CL 218872. At embryonic day 13 most of the binding sites corresponded to type II (98.23%), while type I represented only a minor proportion (1.77%). During development there was an increase in type I binding sites which reached 62.88% in adulthood, while type II binding sites decreased to 37.12%. These results demonstrate a differential ontogeny of two benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. Changes in the benzodiazepine binding population may account for the variability in the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor interaction during chick optic lobe development.", 
    "61": "To study the effect of reduced cortical cholinergic activity on GABAergic and glutamatergic mechanisms in cholinoceptive cortical target regions a novel cholinergic immunotoxin (conjugate of the monoclonal antibody 192IgG against the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor with the cytotoxic protein saporin) was applied, which specifically and selectively destroys cholinergic cells in rat basal forebrain nuclei. To correlate the responses to cholinergic immunolesion in cholinoceptive cortical target regions with cholinergic hypoactivity, quantitative receptor autoradiography to measure NMDA, AMPA and kainate glutamate receptor subtypes, GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors as well as choline uptake sites, and histochemistry to estimate acetylcholinesterase activity were performed in adjacent brain sections. One week after a single intraventricular injection of 4 micrograms of 192IgG-saporin, NMDA receptor binding was markedly reduced in cortical regions displaying a reduced activity of acetylcholinesterase and high-affinity choline uptake sites as a consequence of cholinergic lesion, whereas AMPA and kainate binding sites were significantly increased in these regions. Muscimol binding to GABAA receptors was increased in the caudal portions of frontal and parietal cortices as well as occipital and temporal cortex as compared to the corresponding brain regions from vehicle-injected control rats. Binding levels of benzodiazepine receptors were not affected by the lesion in any of the cortical regions studied. The differential changes in glutamate and GABA receptor subtypes following cholinergic immunolesion might be regarded as the consequence of a cortical reorganization compensating for the reduced cholinergic presynaptic input. The data further suggest that presynaptic cortical cholinergic deficits might affect both glutamatergic and GABAergic functions with different intensity and different directions.", 
    "62": "Some anticonvulsant drugs may suppress seizures by enhancing activity of GABAergic systems. Progesterone (P)'s anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effects may be due to the steroid's actions on GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GBRs) rather than intracellular progestin receptors (PRs), as many P metabolites have a greater effect in vitro on benzodiazepine binding and Cl-flux than P, but poor affinity for PRs. If P's actions are due to metabolism to a progestin more potent at GBRs, then systemic administration of one of those P metabolites should also prevent CNS damage. To test this hypothesis male rats were implanted with a bipolar electrode, aimed above the perforant pathway. Experimental animals received the 5 alpha-reduced P metabolite most effective at GBRs, 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP) 2.5 mg/kg s.c., 3 h prior to perforant pathway stimulation, while control animals received sesame oil vehicle. The duration of chewing and drooling and the incidence of wet dog shakes, partial and full seizures were reduced during perforant pathway stimulation in animals pre-treated with 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP compared to vehicle. Two weeks later, animals pre-treated with 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP had shorter latencies and distances to find a hidden platform in a Morris Water maze task. 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP pre-treatment also reduced damage to CA1 and CA3 layers of the hippocampus and preserved the number of neurons in the hilar region. These data indicate that the neurosteroid metabolite of P, 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP, can have anticonvulsant and may have neuroprotective effects in an animal model of epilepsy. Further, these data suggest that the mechanism of P's protective and anticonvulsant effects may be via GBRs rather than PRs.",

For treating trigeminal neuralgia, carbamazepine had a combined number needed to treat of 2.6 for effectiveness, 3.4 for adverse effects, and 24 for severe effects (withdrawal from study). For treating diabetic neuropathy, anticonvulsants had a combined number needed to treat of 2.5 for effectiveness, 3.1 for adverse effects, and 20 for severe effects. For migraine prophylaxis, anticonvulsants had a combined number needed to treat of 1.6 for effectiveness, 2.4 for adverse effects, and 39 for severe effects.

Brains were removed and endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B inhibitory activity (tribulin) levels measured on day 14 and 24 h after drug withdrawal in different groups of animals. Morphine, ethanol, lorazepam and nicotine withdrawal was associated with significant anxiety and corresponding increase in brain tribulin activity, particularly its MAO A inhibitory component. Cannabis and ondansetron withdrawal were neither associated with anxiety or change in tribulin levels. The investigation supports the postulated role of tribulin as an endogenous correlate of anxiety, its MAO A inhibitory component accounting for a major part of this effect.", 
    "70": "An interaction of harmaline (HA), a beta-carboline, with benzodiazepine (Bzd) receptors, has been reported. HA perfusion induced a similar, although less potent, depressing effect as clonazepam (CLO) on the amplitude of the population spikes (PS) evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices. The suppressant effect of both CLO and HA on PS amplitude was reversed by simultaneous perfusion of the GABA antagonist picrotoxin. These results suggest that HA acts as a weak or partial agonist at Bzd receptors.", 
    "71": "The allosteric modulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), pentobarbital, (+)-etomidate, etazolate, alphaxalone, propofol and chlormethiazole was investigated in cerebellar membranes and membranes from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 193 cells transfected with alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 or alpha 1 gamma 2 subunits. Results obtained indicate that [3H]flunitrazepam binding to recombinant GABAA receptors consisting of alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 subunits could be modulated by these compounds in a way and with a potency similar to that observed in cerebellar membranes. In addition, it was demonstrated that not only receptors consisting of alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 3, but also those consisting of alpha 1 gamma 2 subunits exhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding which could be stimulated by GABA. In contrast to alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors, however, [3H]flunitrazepam binding to recombinant alpha 1 gamma 2 receptors was inhibited by pentobarbital, (+)-etomidate, etazolate, alphaxalone, propofol and chlormethiazole. This seems to indicate that binding sites for these compounds are present on alpha 1 gamma 2 receptors, but that their allosteric interaction with [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites is different from that of alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors.", 
    "72": "The abilities of different compounds acting at alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors to modulate the overflow of [3H]arachidonic acid from rat striatal neurons were examined. The combination of AMPA (0.1 mM) and carbachol (1mM) stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid production, this effect could be dose-dependently enhanced by the newly discovered allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors: cyclothiazide. Competitive (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione [CNQX] and 6-(1-imidazolyl)-7-nitroquinazoline-2,3-dione [YM 900]) and non-competitive antagonists, like 1-(amino)-phenyl)-4-methyl -7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466), antagonized the responses induced by either AMPA + carbachol or AMPA + carbachol + cyclothiazide. In order to appreciate the respective part of AMPA-versus kainate-preferring receptors experiments were performed with kainic acid (0.1 mM) and the more specific kainate agonist domoic acid (0.1 mM). Kainic acid behaves like AMPA, but the response induced by the combination domoic acid + carbachol could not be potentiated by cyclothiazide. On the contrary, concanavalin A potentiated the responses evoked by kainic acid or domoic acid (in combination with carbachol) but did not enhance the AMPA-evoked response. It could be concluded that both AMPA- and kainate-preferring receptors are present in cultured rat striatal neurons and that these two types of receptors were involved together with muscarinic receptors in the overflow of [3H]arachidonic acid.", 
    "73": "The results of the meta-analysis of studies comparing the efficacy of moclobemide, imipramine and so-called sedative antidepressants (amitriptyline, mianserin and maprotiline) in 2416 patients are described. The results demonstrated that in agitated-anxious depressive patients (defined by HAMD factor score or HAMD item 9) a nonsedative, reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide has about equal efficacy as imipramine or sedative antidepressants. All antidepressants were clearly superior to placebo, irrespective of the outcome measures applied (> 50% HAMD decrease, CGI improvement). The efficacy of antidepressants in agitated patients was unrelated to the severity of agitation and did not appear to be inferior to the efficacy in nonagitated patients. Comedication with benzodiazepines had no impact on overall efficacy of either moclobemide or other antidepressants in this patient population. Previous treatment with antidepressants, however, always negatively influenced the outcome with trial drugs, e.g., reduced their efficacy. Placebo response in agitated depressives appeared generally to be low (20-30%) and was clearly reduced with increased severity of agitation, irrespectively of how the agitation was defined.", 
    "74": "Screening and analysis of the numerous benzodiazepines presents a challenge for the forensic toxicologist. The newer benzodiazepines, which are prescribed in daily dose regimens of 0.5-3 mg, are particularly difficult to screen and analyze. Frequently, history or careful investigation by the medical examiner is the only clue that the laboratory has to follow. We describe four cases involving alprazolam and the modification of an existing serum high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure, which allowed us to analyze whole blood. This HPLC procedure for alprazolam uses a protein precipitation step followed by solid-phase extraction. The method is sensitive to 18 ng/mL and linear from 18 to 200 ng/mL. Reproducibility was determined by extracting and analyzing duplicate samples on five separate occasions. The recovery averaged 84% using postmortem blood spiked with 18 and 150 ng/mL alprazolam.",

Drug-free bovine blood was fortified with the different compounds at concentrations relevant to blood analysis: 7, 30, and 70 ng/mL. One-milliliter samples were extracted with n-butyl chloride, dried, and reconstituted with 0.3 ml. of buffer. Results from the two urine-specific kits (EIA-u and FPIA-u) produced either equivalent or reduced cross-reactivity compared with their serum kit counterparts; these results are presented but not discussed further. Among the 38 compounds, the following were detected by all four assays at concentrations of 70 ng/mL or less: alprazolam, alpha-hydroxy-alprazolam, norclobazam, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, norflunitrazepam, miclazolam, 4-hydroxy-midazolam, nitrazepam, noradinazolam, oxazepam, prazepam, 3-hydroxy-prazepam, temazepam, and triazolam. 7-Amino-clonazepam, 7-acetamido-clonazepam, 3-hydroxy-7-acetamidoclonazepam, haloxazepam, loprazolam, 7-amino-nitrazepam, 7-acetamido-nitrazepam, and oxazolam were not detected by any of the assays at concentrations up to 70 ng/mL. A number of benzodiazepines or their metabolites were detectable by some but not all of the six assays: bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, demoxepam, and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam (both RIAs and EIA); adinazolam (RIA-a, EIA, and FPIA); norchlordiazepoxide (both RIAs); clonazepam (RIA-a and EIA); bentazepam, clotiaze-pam, and mexazolam (EIA and FPIA); 7-amino-flunitrazepam and quazepam (EIA); and alpha-hydroxy-triazolam and medazepam (RIA-a).",

    "77": "A retrospective analysis of eclampsia occurring over a 4-year period from January 1990 to December 1993.", 
    "78": "There were 27 cases of eclampsia among 59,599 deliveries during the study period, giving an overall incidence of 45.3 per 100,000 deliveries. Sixteen patients were nulliparous and the mean age was 29 years. Two-thirds of the cohort were booked patients and more than half of the cohort (55.6%) had their first seizure despite being in hospital. The majority (86.2%) of all seizures recorded occurred in the antepartum and intrapartum period. Eleven of the patients (40.7%) were asymptomatic prior to the first fit while headache was the commonest symptom of impending eclampsia in the remainder. Fifteen patients (55.6%) had significant proteinuria and this was associated with significant neonatal morbidity. The mean gestational age was 35.9 weeks and the mean birth weight was 2,328g. Major areas of substandard management included failure to administer anticonvulsant prophylaxis and antihypertensive agents when indicated, failure to assess for proteinuria, and failure to closely monitor the hypertensive and proteinuric patient. Seven patients developed convulsions despite anticonvulsant prophylaxis. Twenty-four patients were delivered by Caesarean section. There were 26 live born infants (singletons) and one abortus. There was no perinatal mortality. Neonatal morbidity was frequent and attributable to prematurity (51.9%) and birth asphyxia (29.6%). The majority of infants were well neurologically on long term follow-up. There was no maternal mortality but significant morbidity was present in 8 patients (29.6%). High uric acid levels were associated with intrauterine death, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation. Seven patients remained hypertensive on follow-up. Residual neurological deficits persisted in 3 patients.", 
    "79": "The incidence of eclampsia at Kandang Kerbau Hospital shows an unsteady decline over the past 4 years. It carries significant foetal mortality (3.7%) as well as neonatal (74.1%) and maternal (29.6%) morbidity. The observation that neither the occurrence of antenatal office visits nor hospitalisation prevents eclampsia, and that substandard management was identified in most of the cases (77.8%) shows that there is no room for complacency and that more needs to be done. Improvement in patient assessment, institution of appropriate preventive therapy, a high index of suspicion even in apparently low-risk patients coupled with a disease notification system and regular audit may be the key strategies to reduce the incidence of this dreaded obstetric complication.", 
    "80": "Intrathecal morphine provides effective postoperative pain relief in major orthopaedic surgery. In use, however, is associated with unpleasant side effects like nausea and vomiting. The effect of different premedications on postoperative emetic sequelae induced by intrathecal morphine was studied in a prospective, double blind study. Sixty patients scheduled for arthroplasty surgery of the lower extremity were anaesthetized with spinal anaesthesia with a combination of isobaric bupivacaine 20 mg and morphine 0.3 mg. For premedication the patients were randomised to three groups of equal size. They received either oral diazepam (5-15 mg), oral promethazine (10 mg) or a combination of promethazine and transdermal scopolamine (1.5 mg). Sixty percent of the patients with both promethazine and transdermal scopolamine were totally free from postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) symptoms compared to those premedicated with diazepam (40%) or promethazine alone (30%). Promethazine together with transdermal scopolamine reduced significantly the number of patients with vomiting (to 25%) and also vomiting episodes. This combination was also more efficient in reducing the incidence of nausea (to 25%) and nausea episodes than promethazine along (P < 0.05). Combination also reduced the requests for additional pain relief (P < 0.05). PONV occurred in a majority of patients during the first 12 hours of the 24 hour study period and the need for additional analgesics thereafter. The incidence of itching (50-65%) and urinary catheterisation (55-70%) was similar in all groups. In conclusion, the combination of oral promethazine and transdermal scopolamine was most effective in reducing PONV symptoms and also reduced the need for postoperative pain treatment.", 
    "81": "Third-molar extraction patients (N = 231) underwent one of five preparatory interventions offering different levels of relaxation, control, and self-efficacy to evaluate the relative importance of each of these elements of coping in the context of an acute stressor. Prior to surgery subjects completed measures of monitoring and blunting. Results indicated that relaxation, perceived control, and self-efficacy were each significant, and roughly equivalent, contributors to coping, and operated in an additive way. Intervention type, and the interaction of intervention type with blunting score, significantly predicted distress prior to and during surgery. It was concluded that no single element is crucial to effective coping and that interventions that provide more coping elements are generally superior. Additionally, the interaction of coping style with intervention is as strong a contributor to coping outcome as the other factors. Those who prefer to distract themselves may benefit most from interventions that require the least possible personal investment of effort and attention.",

    "83": "This study was conducted to determine the potential for an interaction between nefazodone, a new antidepressant, and triazolam after a single dose of triazolam and multiple doses of nefazodone in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy male volunteers. The metabolism of triazolam is dependent on cytochrome P450 3A4, and because nefazodone has been shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of this isoenzyme, this study was conducted to assess the potential for an interaction between the two drugs. Twelve subjects were assigned to one of two groups and received an oral dose of either placebo or 0.25 mg of triazolam on days 1 and 2. Nefazodone (200 mg) was administered twice daily from the evening of day 2 to the morning of day 9. Subjects received either 0.25 mg of triazolam or placebo with the nefazodone dose on the mornings of days 8 and 9. Serial blood samples were collected on the mornings of days 1, 2, 8, and 9 for the analysis of triazolam by a validated gas chromatography/electron capture detection method and on days 8 and 9 for the analysis of nefazodone and its metabolites, hydroxynefazodone (HO-nefazodone) and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet method. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there was no effect of triazolam on the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, or mCPP after the coadministration of triazolam and nefazodone. There was a significant effect of 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam. Mean triazolam peak concentration values increased (p = 0.003) from 2.33 to 3.88 ng/ml when triazolam was administered alone and in combination with nefazodone, respectively. Corresponding mean triazolam area under the curve values increased (p < 0.001) from 8.14 to 31.74 ng.h/ml. The plasma protein binding of triazolam was approximately 85% when triazolam was given alone and when given concurrently with nefazodone. The increase in triazolam concentrations in plasma appears to be attributable to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolism by nefazodone. If triazolam is coadministered with nefazodone, a reduction in the triazolam dosage is recommended; no dosage adjustment is required for nefazodone.", 
    "84": "One hundred two healthy men were evaluated in one of three studies conducted to evaluate the coadministration of nefazodone, 200 mg twice daily, and three benzodiazepines: triazolam, 0.25 mg; alprazolam, 1 mg twice daily; or lorazepam, 2 mg twice daily. In the first study, psychomotor performance, memory, and sedation were assessed at 0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 9 hours after single doses of triazolam alone and again after 7 days of nefazodone. Data from 6 of 12 subjects in this study were evaluable because of a dosing error in the other 6 subjects. In the subsequent two parallel design studies, groups of 12 volunteers received 7 days of either placebo; nefazodone, 200 mg; alprazolam, 1 mg twice daily; or alprazolam plus nefazodone or, in the second study, either placebo; nefazodone; lorazepam, 2 mg twice daily; or lorazepam plus nefazodone; the studies were identical, double-dummy, double-blind designs. Psychomotor performance, memory, and sedation were assessed at 0, 1, 3, and 8 hours after the 8 a.m. dose on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the studies. In all studies, blood samples were also obtained at testing times so that effect/concentration comparisons could be made and so full pharmacokinetic analyses could be done for separate studies. Nefazodone had no effect on psychomotor performance, memory, or sedation relative to placebo in any study. The mean maximum observed effect (MaxOE) on psychomotor performance and sedation were increased when triazolam was given after 7 days of nefazodone (p < 0.05); also, triazolam concentration was 60% higher at this time. Alprazolam and lorazepam impaired performance on day 1 (mean MaxOE, 34 and 30%, respectively) relative to placebo and nefazodone. By day 7 of alprazolam or lorazepam, psychomotor impairment decreased, indicating the development of tolerance. Alprazolam plus nefazodone increased psychomotor impairment (MaxOE, approximately 50%) and sedation relative to alprazolam alone on days 3, 5, and 7 (p < 0.05). Higher alprazolam concentrations explained the increased impairment in the alprazolam plus nefazodone treatment group; however, it is also possible that there was a delay in the development of tolerance. There were no differences in psychomotor impairment, memory, sedation, or lorazepam concentration detected between the lorazepam alone and lorazepam plus nefazodone treatments. This is consistent with the absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between nefazodone and lorazepam. These results indicate that if the coadministration of a benzodiazepine is required in patients receiving nefazodone therapy, clinically significant interactions would be less likely with those eliminated by conjugative metabolism such as lorazepam. In cases where a benzodiazepine eliminated by oxidative metabolism is required, a reduction in initial dosage and careful clinical evaluation for signs of psychomotor impairment may be appropriate.",

Ten patients received propofol infusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and ten controls received diazepam. Blood levels of cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline were sampled.

    "90": "Sustained agonist stimulation induces an asymmetric down-regulation of brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR): 43 +/- 2% in the right and 26 +/- 2% in the left cerebral hemisphere, respectively (Ref. 1). In order to determine the possible involvement of endogenous diacylglycerols produced under muscarinic stimulation in the down-regulation phenomenon, here we have studied the effects of synthetic diacylglycerols and a phorbol ester on cells dissociated from rat cerebral cortex. Oleylacetylglycerol decreased the amount of cell-surface mAChR by 37 +/- 2% and 25 +/- 2% in right and left cerebral cortex, respectively. Long-term treatment with phorbol dibutyrate also produced internalization of the mAChR (25 +/- 1.5% and 33 +/- 2% in right and left cortical cells, respectively). These changes occurred without modification of the Kdapp for the selective antagonist pirenzepine. The action of calcium ions was also studied using incubation of cells with the ionophore A23187. No changes were observed in the amount of mAChR detected at the plasma membrane with the ionophore alone, but when used in combination with phorbol dibutyrate and the agonist carbamylcholine a sinergistic decrease in mAChR was apparent. It is concluded that long-term exposure to exogenously added diacyglycerols and phorbol ester significantly reduces the amount of mAChR detected at the plasma membrane and abolishes the asymmetry of the down-regulation phenomenon observed under specific muscarinic stimulation, suggesting that diacylglycerols may be one of the factors responsible for such asymmetry.", 
    "91": "The purpose of this study was to assess the pharmacological characteristics of the benzodiazepine binding site in the brain of septic animals. We induced endotoxin shock in rats using a caecum ligation and puncture model. Following examination of the physiological state of the rats 24 hr after the caecum ligation and puncture, brain tissue samples were prepared for biochemical assay of amino acids and for the [3H]-diazepam radioligand binding assay. Amino acids assays indicated that the concentration of aromatic amino acids was higher in the CLP group (P< 0.05), the branched chain amino acid concentration was lower in the CLP group (P< 0.05) and the sulfur-containing amino acid concentration was elevated in the CLP group (P< 0.05) than in both the control and the sham-operated groups. [3H]-diazepam radioligand binding assays demonstrated that the number of receptors in the septic rats was increased in the forebrain (CLP rats; 2.37 +/- 0.04 pmol x mg(-1) protein, control rats; 1.45 +/- 0.02 pmol x mg(-1) protein, sham-operated rats; 1.49 +/- 0.03 pmol x mg(-1) protein), cerebellum (CLP rats; 1.55 +/- 0.05 pmol x mg(-1) protein, control rats; 1.05 +/- 0.02 pmol x mg(-1) protein, sham-operated rats: 1.09 +/- 0.02 pmol x mg(-1) protein) and brain stem (CLP rats; 1.21 +/- 0.04 pmol x mg(-1) protein, control rats; 0.61 +/- 0.02 pmol x mg(-1) protein, sham-operated rats; 0.63 +/- 0.02 pmol x mg(-1) protein) compared with the control and sham-operated rats (P< 0.05). In conclusion, it was considered that the increased number of benzodiazepine receptors may be one cause of the neuronal alteration observed in septic shock animals.", 
    "92": "Sublingual triazolam 0.2 mg (T) was compared with peroral diazepam 10 mg (D) as a premedicant in a randomised, double-blind study. Eighty-one ASA I-III patients aged 18-70 yr, scheduled for elective surgery and general anaesthesia were studied. The patients were premedicated about one hour preoperatively. The T-group subjects (n = 41) received triazolam sl after a placebo po and the D-group subjects (n = 40) diazepam po before a sl placebo. Anxiety and sedation were evaluated before premedication, every 15 min after that until the patient was removed to the operating room, just before the induction of anaesthesia and both 30 and 60 min after operation. Anxiety and sedation were evaluated by the patient using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and by the anaesthetist with a scale of 0-3 for anxiety and 0-4 for sedation. The patients' experience with regards to their premedication and visit to the operating unit were investigated after the operation. In both groups sedation and anxiolysis became different at 30-45 min after premedication, but at the time just before the induction of anaesthesia there was sedation and anxiolysis only in the T-group. There was no difference between the groups at any time. The T-group patients were more satisfied with their premedication and visit to the operating unit. The study drugs did not cause any cardiorespiratory or other side effects. We conclude that triazolam 0.2 mg sl is at least as effective a premedication as diazepam 10 mg po, that is suitable for patients that cannot swallow, and that the patients were more satisfied with it than with diazepam.", 
    "93": "Semichronic experiments on rats with gastric fistula have revealed that the resection of the proximal third of the small intestine results in impairments of the gastric secretion inhibition induced by gastrozepin or histodil blockade of M-choline- and H2-receptors. At the same time the operation has no noticeable impact on the gastric secretion inhibition caused by pituitrin (vasopressin) on V1-receptors. The difference found is accounted for by a relative specialization of the enterogastric influences that regulate the sensitivity of gastric secretory mechanisms to inhibitory signals.", 
    "94": "After benzodiazepine (BDZ) administration, a decrease in cardiac vagal tone has been described during wakefulness, but data on cardiac autonomic function during sleep are lacking. Melatonin (MLT), reported to have hypnotic properties, caused an increase in vagal tone in animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate heart rate (HR) variability during sleep after a single bedtime dose of triazolam (TRI, 0.125 mg) and MLT (100 mg) in six healthy young subjects. We evaluated tonic (vagal activity) HR modifications in relation to sleep as well as phasic (sympathetic activity) HR modifications in relation to spontaneous body movements during rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. No significant change in sympathetic activity was observed after TRI and MLT in comparison with placebo, whereas TRI caused a significant decrease in vagal tone during sleep. Our nocturnal study seems to confirm previous diurnal findings about a decrease in vagal tone by BDZs.", 
    "95": "Many drugs eliminated by the liver exhibit age-related differences in systemic clearance, necessitating different dosage requirements in children and adults. However, the physiological basis for these age-related changes is not well defined, including the importance of liver size in determining systemic clearance. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine liver volume in pediatric and adolescent patients, in whom systemic clearance of three model substrates [lorazepam (0.03 mg/kg), antipyrine (10 mg/kg), and indocyanine green (ICG; 0.5 mg/kg)] was also determined. In 16 children (ages 3.3-18.8 years; 8 boys), liver volume ranged from 469 to 1640 ml (median 937), and was significantly related to age, body weight, and body surface area (BSA). Younger children had larger liver normalized to body weight (ml/kg), but there was no difference when liver volume was normalized to BSA (ml/m2). Unnormalized lorazepam and ICG clearances (ml/min) were significantly related to absolute liver volume (r2 = 50.2% and 31.4%, respectively), whereas unnormalized antipyrine clearance was not. Lorazepam, ICG, and antipyrine clearance normalized to BSA did not exhibit age-related changes, nor did lorazepam or ICG clearance normalized to body weight decreased significantly with increasing age (r2 = 36.9%, p=0.012), as did antipyrine clearance relative to liver volume. Thus, age-related changes in drug clearance and the importance of liver volume may differ based on the principal hepatic mechanisms involved in drug elimination.", 
    "96": "1. The acute behavioural effects of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine, idazoxan and delequamine (RS-15385-197) were compared in two tests of exploratory behaviour in the rat, operated in tandem. These were the elevated X-maze test (5 min) and a modified holeboard test (12 min), which comprised a holeboard arena with a small roof in one corner as a 'refuge'. Rats were first placed into this corner, thus enabling measurements of initial emergence latency and the number of forays. The experiments were always done with a concomitant vehicle control group, with 10-12 rats per group, and with the treatment blinded. 2. In order to validate the tests, the effects of representatives of four classes of psychoactive agents were examined, viz. picrotoxin (anxiogenic), chlordiazepoxide (anxiolytic), (+)-amphetamine (stimulant) and diphenhydramine (sedative). The modified holeboard tended to be more sensitive than the measurement of total arm entries in the elevated X-maze at detecting drug effects on exploratory behaviour, but unlike the X-maze it could not clearly identify each class of agent. Thus, picrotoxin (5 mg kg(-1), i.p.) reduced total arm entries and open arm exploration in the X-maze (P<0.02) and suppressed most measures of activity in the holeboard (P<0.05); chlordiazepoxide (7.5 mg kg(-1), i.p.) increased total arm entries and open arm exploration (P<0.02) in the X-maze, without clear-cut effects in the holeboard; (+)-amphetamine (1 mg kg(-1), i.p.) had no significant effects in the X-maze, but increased most holeboard activities (P<0.05), and diphenhydramine (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) reduced total arm entries in the X-maze (P<0.002) and hole exploration in the holeboard (P<0.05).", 
    "97": "The purpose of the present experiment was to study the \"kindling\" hypothesis of alcohol withdrawal stating that exposure to repeated episodes of alcohol withdrawal results in an increased severity of subsequent withdrawal reactions. Two groups of male Wistar rats were subjected to 13 episodes of 2 days severe alcohol intoxication and 5 days alcohol withdrawal. Animals in the control group (n = 80) developed clinical withdrawal signs following each intoxication episode. In the diazepam group (n = 80) the withdrawal reactions during episodes 1-9 were blocked by intraperitoneal diazepam administration (0-30 mg/kg) 8, 11 and 15 h into withdrawal. During episode 10-13 diazepam treatment was terminated and convulsive withdrawal behaviour was observed 9-15 h after last alcohol dose. The probability of seizure activity during these four withdrawal episodes was calculated as 0.239 and 0.066 in the control and the diazepam groups, respectively. Based on Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this difference was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). No differences in the non-convulsive alcohol withdrawal symptoms tremor, hyperactivity and rigidity were detected between controls and diazepam animals after diazepam treatment. It was concluded that the increased convulsive behaviour in the control group was caused by cumulated kindling-like cerebral alterations during the previous repeated alcohol withdrawal phases.", 
    "98": "The effects of single oral doses of DN-2327 (DN, 2 mg or 3 mg), a newly developed partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist, and alprazolam (APZ, 0.8 mg), a full receptor agonist, on psychomotor function and short-term memory were assessed using three psychometric tests: letter cancellation, visual vigilance and Sternberg's memory scanning task. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in this study. Randomized, double-blind, cross-over test sessions were conducted at 2-week intervals. Both 3 mg DN and 0.8 mg APZ increased the time to completion of the letter cancellation task at 3 h after administration, but neither had any effect on accuracy of response. In the visual vigilance task, which required relatively intense concentration and continuous attention, both the number of errors and reaction times to correct responses significantly increased from 1.5 to 3.5 h after administration of 3 mg DN and at 3.5 h after administration with 0.8 mg APZ. DN at 2 mg also significantly increased the number of errors from 1.5 to 3.5 h after administration, but it did not affect reaction times. In the memory scanning task, 3 mg DN, but not 2 mg DN or APZ, significantly increased overall reaction times at 2 h after administration. These performance deficits paralleled the time-course changes in serum concentrations of both drugs and appeared to be associated with the hypnotic-sedative effects of the drugs tested. These findings did not support those of previous preclinical studies of DN, indicating superiority of DN over conventional full benzodiazepine agonists/anxiolytics in terms of adverse behavioral consequences.", 
    "99": "The fragment placement method has been successfully extended to the problem of envelope-directed design. The atom assignment paradigm was based on molecular similarity between two molecular structures. A composite supersurface is defined to form the surface onto which the molecular fields are projected. The assignment process is then determined by using molecular similarity in the objective function to be optimized. In principle, this procedure is closely similar to that outlined in the previous paper for site-directed design. The rationale has been extensively tested on two benzodiazepine antagonists believed to bind to the same site.", 
    "100": "We have developed a program, HookSpace, which provides a simplistic approach to assessing the diversity of molecular databases. The spatial relationship between pairs of intramolecular functional groups can be analysed in a variety of ways to provide both qualitative and quantitative measures of diversity. Results are described and contrasted for two commercially available databases and a combinatorial library of benzodiazepam derivatives. HookSpace highlights the main differences in molecular content of these data sets.", 
    "101": "The National Animal Poison Control Center received 28 calls of isoniazid (INH) exposures in dogs and cats between 1987 and 1993. The ingestion of a single 300 mg INH tablet was the most common complaint. Isoniazid has a low therapeutic margin and produces life threatening signs in dogs ingesting single 300 mg human tablets. The LD50 of INH in dogs is estimated at 50 mg/kg bw, which is probably similar to that for humans. However, rodents are among the species most resistant to INH and thus are not good animal models for toxic dose extrapolation. The more consistent clinical signs reported were recurrent clonic-tonic seizures followed by a stuporous state with poor response to stimulus. Ideal treatment combines vitamin B6 given as a single i.v. bolus at an equivalent dose to the amount of INH ingested and anticonvulsants such as 1 mg diazepam/kg bw. This combination acts synergistically to improve GABAergic transmission in the CNS and has proved effective in protecting animals from further convulsions and death, even after several seizure episodes, as often encountered in clinical situations.", 
    "102": "Data on 194 fatal poisoning cases admitted to various hospitals in Tehran over a 1-y period showed an overall male:female ratio of 1.9:1, with females predominating only in the 13-19 y age group. Fifty-five percent of the deaths were attributed to suicide, affecting more females than males. Most cases were referred to hospitals between 1 pm and 1 am. There was a slight seasonal variation, with the highest number of cases in July and March and the lowest in April. Drugs were the most frequently used poison (27%) followed closely by pesticides (24%). Benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants accounted for 38% of drug-related poisonings, with diazepam (61%), imipramine (44%) and amitriptyline (33%) the most commonly used agents in each group. Insecticides were responsible for 58% of pesticide-related deaths. Following pesticides, 13% of the deaths were due to chemicals, with depilator and solvent abuse accounting for 88% of the cases in this group.", 
    "103": "The reaction between two series of 7-dimethylaminovinyl pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines 4(a-r) 7a, 7d, 7f, 7(h-j) and hydrazine in acetic acid is investigated. The structure of 4,7-dihydro-6-(1'H-pyrazol-3'-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7- ones 5(a-r) and 7-methyl-6-(1'H-pyrazol-3'-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines 8a, 8d, 8f, 8(h-j) are attributed to the isolated products and the pathway of this reaction is suggested. The in vitro benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) affinity of the title compounds are determined by testing their ability to displace 3H-flunitrazepam from its specific binding in bovine brain membranes. The IC50 and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) ratio values give valuable indications about affinity and behavioural profile of these new BzR ligands. Included in this investigation are indicated several structure-affinity relationships of the title compounds.", 
    "104": "Abecarnil (ABC) is a beta-carboline that acts as an agonist at benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors. It possesses anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, but produces little sedation and is without muscle relaxant effects. To explain this unusual profile of activity, two hypotheses have been advanced: either 1) ABC acts as a partial agonist or 2) ABC acts as a full agonist, but only at a sub-population of BZD receptors. The present experiment used cross-tolerance profiles between BZDs and ABC to differentiate these hypotheses based upon predictions of receptor theory: tolerance produced to a full agonist should confer even greater cross-tolerance to a partial agonsit. Rats were trained in a three-choice drug discrimination procedure to detect the benzodiazepine, midazolam (MDZ, 1.0 mg/kg) from pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 20 mg/kg) from saline. Tested acutely, MDZ and ABC substituted for MDZ with similar potencies. Following chronic treatment with the BZD-agonist diazepam (DZP; 20 mg/kg per 8 h for 7 days), both the MDZ and ABC dose-effect curves were significantly shifted to the right, and both drugs showed a comparable three-fold decrease in potency. The chronic administration of ABC (4.0 mg/kg per 8 h for 7 days) produced a different spectrum of results. No significant shift occurred in the MDZ dose-effect curve, but there was a significant seven-fold shift to the right of the ABC dose-effect curve. Throughout all test, PTZ-lever responding rarely occurred and did not account for more than 20% of lever selections for any individual test. These data support the hypothesis that ABC acts as a full agonist at a sub-population of BZD receptors, which mediate its substitution for MDZ.", 
    "105": "Benzodiazepines have a wide variety of indications. However, CNS and psychiatric adverse reactions, tolerance, and withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines are becoming increasingly recognized and must be better understood for proper drug use. Certain benzodiazepines are associated with memory impairment and other cognitive defects and hyperexcitability phenomena during treatment (early-morning insomnia, daytime anxiety) and following withdrawal (rebound insomnia and anxiety, seizures). Elimination half-life, receptor-binding affinity, effects on the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes, and the interaction of these factors appear to be major determinants of frequency and severity of these untoward effects. Rapid drug elimination and high receptor-binding affinity were initially suggested as primary underlying factors which determine frequency, severity, and type of the side effects of benzodiazepines during administration and withdrawal. Newer data and information on triazolobenzodiazepines indicate that these psychiatric adverse reactions also relate to whether the benzodiazepine has strong direct effects on the LC-NE and HPA systems. Initial suppression of the LC-NE and HPA systems is followed, on an interdose basis, by a significant rebound and activation. This repetitive pattern of suppression followed by rebound results in a neurophysiologic and behavioral sensitization (kindling) of the limbic system and consequently contributes to central nervous system and psychiatric adverse reactions. The tendency of certain of these side effects to worsen over time supports empirically this neurophysiologic and biochemical model.", 
    "106": "We examined the effects on sleep and memory of a nighttime dose of triazolam, 0.125 mg, in seven subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who were reported by caregivers to be frequently up at night. Subjects were admitted to an intermediate care hospital ward for the 8-day ABA design protocol (placebo baseline-drug-placebo washout). Drug or placebo was given each evening at 2100 h. Sleep was assessed with a wrist-worn activity monitor. Memory was evaluated using a computerized delayed-matching-to-sample (DMTS) task administered at 0800 and 2130 h. Triazolam had no significant effects on total sleep time at night, latency to sleep onset, number of arousals, or time asleep during the day. DMTS performance was significantly worse at night compared to morning during baseline, but there were no significant drug effects. Our results suggest the standard geriatric dose of triazolam, 0.125 mg, may not be an effective hypnotic in AD patients with disrupted sleep, but neither does it substantially worsen the recent memory deficits of AD.", 
    "107": "The anxiolytic-like effects tolerance and withdrawal from chronic treatment with sodium valproate [200, 300, and 400 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)] were compared with those of a known anxiolytic drug, lorazepam (0.025, 0.05, and 0.10 mg/kg, i.p.), in the light-dark aversion test in mice. Furthermore, we investigated whether acute treatment with clonidine, 0.03 mg/kg i.p., an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, could reduce the increased anxiety on withdrawal from chronic treatment. Mice were given 14 daily i.p. injections of valproate, lorazepam, or vehicle and were tested in the light-dark aversion test 30 min or 24 or 48 h after the last drug or vehicle administration. Results showed that both acute and chronic valproate treatment reduced the aversion of mice for the light area, as well as increased the number of transitions, thus indicating an anxiolytic-like potential. Furthermore, in contrast to lorazepam, tolerance to the anxiolytic-like effects of valproate did not occur, and withdrawal from chronic treatment (300 mg/kg, i.p.) in our behavioral paradigm was not associated with any behavioral disturbances referring to an increased anxiety state. Finally, low doses of clonidine (0.03 mg/kg, i.p.) were shown to have anxiolytic properties and to reverse the anxiogenic effects of lorazepam on withdrawal.", 
    "108": "Seizures may result from an impaired balance between excitation and inhibition. We tested whether clonazepam [a benzodiazepine that enhances GABAA inhibitory transmission (0.2 or 1.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.])] suppresses an age-dependent pattern of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced phenomena in 7-, 12-, 18-, 25-, and 60-day-old rats (10, 40, 100, 100, and 200 mg/kg of NMDA, i.p., respectively). There were no effects of clonazepam against the NMDA-induced automatisms and emprosthotonus. In 7-day-old rats, clonazepam was proconvulsant in clonic-tonic seizures (it decreased the latency to onset of seizures, whereas it was anticonvulsant in 25-day-old rats. There was no difference between anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam and its solvent in 12- and 60-day-old rats. Both cortical and hippocampal EEG seizures was extremely poor in this model. There was no improvement of EEG recording after clonazepam. The results demonstrate that impaired excitation cannot be simply balanced by an enhanced inhibition and that the drug effects in young animals cannot be predicted from the effects in adults.", 
    "109": "The ability of the benzodiazepine receptor full agonist diazepam, the selective agonist abecarnil, and the partial agonist imidazenil to antagonize convulsions induced by isoniazid (200 mg/kg, S.C.) was studied in mice chronically treated with diazepam (3 mg/kg, i.p., three times daily) or abecarnil (0.1 or 1 mg/kg, i.p., three times daily or 6 mg/kg, S.C., daily). Diazepam induced tolerance to its own anticonvulsant effect. In contrast, chronic treatment with abecarnil failed to induce tolerance to its own anticonvulsant activity. Animals treated with abecarnil at 0.1 mg/kg developed cross-tolerance to imidazenil, whereas those treated with 1 mg/kg became less sensitive to diazepam. Mice chronically treated with abecarnil at 6 mg/kg showed almost complete tolerance to diazepam. Abecarnil was able to antagonize the convulsions elicited by isoniazid in diazepam-tolerant mice. These data indicate that chronic administration of abecarnil, unlike that of classical benzodiazepines, does not induce tolerance to its anticonvulsant effect, and that abecarnil overcomes tolerance induced by long-term treatment with the full agonist diazepam.", 
    "110": "This study demonstrates cholecystokinin receptor plasticity in response to salt-loading in the rat and mouse hypothalamus. It identifies, for the first time, the cholecystokinin receptor subtypes involved, firstly by receptor autoradiography and secondly by in situ hybridization. Both species showed increases in hypothalamic [125I]Bolton Hunter-cholecystokinin-8 binding. Co-incubation with the specific cholecystokininA and cholecystokininB antagonists, devazepide and CI-988, indicated that in the rat cholecystokininB receptor binding markedly increased, with a small increase in cholecystokininA receptor binding. In the mouse the response was comprised solely of cholecystokininA receptors. In situ hybridization studies were carried out on a range of peptide messenger ribonucleic acids after salt-loading. In the rat large increases in hypothalamic gene expression were detected for oxytocin, vasopressin, corticotrophin-releasing factor and preprocholecystokinin. In the mouse only vasopressin messenger ribonucleic acid increased, whilst hypothalamic oxytocin, preprocholecystokinin and corticotropin-releasing factor remained unchanged. However, corticotrophin-releasing factor messenger ribonucleic acid increased in the mouse amygdala. In situ hybridization was performed using oligonucleotide probes specific for either the cholecystokininA or cholecystokininB receptor messenger ribonucleic acid, and this showed good agreement with the receptor autoradiography. CholecystokininB receptor expression was upregulated in the rat hypothalamus along with a small but significant increase in cholecystokininA receptors. In the mouse only cholecystokininA receptor expression was increased. In addition to these molecular changes rats lost about 25% of their body weight during six days of salt-challenge, whilst mice continued to grow in line with controls. This work demonstrates differential changes in cholecystokinin receptor subtype binding between the rat and the mouse. It represents the first report of differential changes in cholecystokininA and cholecystokininB receptor messenger ribonucleic acids within the brain, and shows that cholecystokinin receptors within the rodent hypothalamus are capable of plastic responses to chronic osmotic stress."
