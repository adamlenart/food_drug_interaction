G1 was administered with methotrimeprazine as a pre-anesthetic medication, intravenously midazolam-ketamine as bolus for induction and midazolam-ketamine by continuous intravenous infusion for a 60 minute-period of maintenance. G2: the same as for G1. plus an increase in the midazolam dose during maintenance. G3: the same treatment as for G2, plus the addition of xylazine during maintenance. Immediately after induction the anesthetic maintenance started, and measures were taken 15 minutes after pre-medication, at 10 minutes intervals, during maintenance (M0 to M7).", 
    "2": "Bradycardia, atrioventricular blockage, bradypnea and hypoxemia were shown in G3. G1 and G2 showed a slight hypotension only.", 
    "3": "There were some advantages by using the continuous intravenous via: no parameters oscillation and reduction in the anesthetic recovery period. The increase in midazolam dose brought about little parametric variations which were greater when xylazine was used, with a consequent hypoxemia, bradyarrhytmia, and decrease in respiratory frequency and minute volume.", 
    "4": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as olanzapine, have been reported to activate the locus coeruleus (LC) and lead to acute expression of the Fos-like immediate early gene (IEG) protein in the LC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Stimuli that activate the LC have been reported to increase expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. However, the effects of chronic treatment with olanzapine on IEG expression and the dose-dependence of the effects of olanzapine on IEG and TH expression are not known. Thus, we examined Fos-like, c-Jun, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), early growth response 1 (Egr-1), early growth response 2 (Egr-2), and TH immunoreactivity expression in the LC and mPFC in rats receiving 2, 4, 8, or 15 mg/kg/day olanzapine by s.c. osmotic minipump for 4 h, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 4 weeks. ATF-2 expression was up-regulated at all treatment durations, while Egr-1 and Egr-2 were down-regulated in both the LC and mPFC. Fos-like expression was up-regulated through 2 weeks, but not 4 weeks, in both the LC and mPFC. C-Jun expression was up-regulated for 4 weeks in the LC and for 2 weeks, but not 4 weeks, in the mPFC. At all doses, there were rapid and sustained increases in TH immunoreactivity in the LC, but only delayed increases in the mPFC. These data indicate that olanzapine has rapid effects on IEG in the LC and mPFC, many of which are sustained through four weeks of treatment. Further, these data indicate that the delayed increase in TH expression in the mPFC parallels, and may play an important role in, the increased efficacy of olanzapine that emerges over time in humans.", 
    "5": "Neutropenia and agranulocytosis are risks known to occur with phenothiazines and clozapine. The mechanisms responsible for these conditions currently remain unclear. To our knowledge, no case of fatal agranulocytosis as a result of olanzapine treatment was reported in the literature. Thus any case of severe neutropenia occurring in a patient receiving olanzapine is alarming to clinicians. First, a review of the literature produced 41 anecdotic cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis during treatment with olanzapine (Zyprexa) reported in a total of 24 publications. Second, we report a case of neutropenia, which proved to be fatal in a schizophrenia patient receiving olanzapine and thiazide. The cause of the death was Myelodysplastic syndrome. There is not enough evidence to prove the involvement of either olanzapine or hydrochlorothiazide or the interaction between them in this patient's myelodysplasia. Bone marrow cytogenetic study confirmed the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11, as reported in myeloid leukemia. If this patient would have died suddenly without the laboratory investigations that lead to the diagnosis of myeloblastic leukemia, the cause would have been probably and wrongfully allotted to treatment with olanzapine.",

Physicians were blinded to the gas used and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) data.

Twenty supplemental oxygen patients and 19 compressed air patients met at least 1 criterion for respiratory depression. Six supplemental oxygen patients and 5 compressed air patients experienced hypoxia (P=.97; effect size 0%; 95% confidence interval -15% to +15%). Fourteen patients in each group met ETCO2 criteria for respiratory depression but were not hypoxic. Physicians identified respiratory depression in 8 of 11 patients who became hypoxic and 0 of 28 patients who met ETCO2 criteria for respiratory depression but who did not become hypoxic. There were no adverse events.", 
    "9": "Supplemental oxygen did not reduce (or trend toward reducing) the incidence of hypoxia in patients moderately sedated with midazolam and fentanyl.

    "10": "The antidepressive effect of sleep deprivation (SD) in depressed patients disappears after sleep of the recovery night and after early morning naps. Both can provoke a rapid relapse into depression in SD-responders. In addition, the occurrence of short episodes of sleep (termed microsleep, MS) during partial SD (PSD) is associated with SD-nonresponse, suggesting that MS during the time awake may be related to relapse or PSD-nonresponse. The GABA-benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil augments vigilance and reduces NonREM-sleep pressure in early morning recovery sleep in volunteers after SD. Therefore, in this study 27 patients with major depression were subjected to a PSD. In a double blind randomized design either flumazenil or placebo was orally applied during PSD in order to examine whether the application of flumazenil reduces sleep propensity and thus, increases antidepressant efficacy of PSD. EEG was registered continuously for 60h by a portable device for the assessment of microsleep episodes at baseline and during PSD. Flumazenil application significantly suppressed frequency and total amount of MS. While the antidepressant efficacy of PSD was not different between flumazenil and placebo during PSD, the subjective mood improved after the recovery night in patients treated with flumazenil. It is concluded that GABAergic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of MS during PSD, which may be related to a mood stabilizing effect after the recovery night. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between the occurrence of MS during PSD and mood variation have to be further clarified.",

After 8 and 9 weeks of fixed-dose treatment, patients were hospitalized for 24 hours. On 1 admission, ordered at random, treatment was maintained; on the other, placebo was substituted double blind. The Anxious Thoughts and Tendencies questionnaire was administered before treatment. Alprazolam plasma levels were measured 7 times on the day after each admission. Before each blood sampling, the Profile of Mood States and performance tasks were administered, and vital signs were recorded. On the day after abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam, Profile of Mood States anxiety, depression, fatigue, and confusion increased; vigor and elation decreased; speed on the digit symbol substitution task improved; and systolic blood pressure increased substantially over time. High Anxious Thoughts and Tendencies scores were related specifically to more anxiety. Our findings (1) confirm that dysphoric mood, fatigue, low energy, confusion, and elevated systolic blood pressure are part of the early syndrome of withdrawal from alprazolam in patients with panic disorder, notably as the drop in plasma levels approaches 50%; (2) indicate a psychomotor deficit persisting beyond dose stabilization; (3) suggest that an anxiety-prone cognitive style measurable before undertaking treatment may be a risk factor for more severe anxiety upon discontinuation; and (4) provide a rationale for applying cognitive behavior therapy during benzodiazepine taper.",

The goal of this prospective study is to evaluate the early effect of olanzapine and risperidone treatment on pancreatic beta-cell function in atypical-naive schizophrenic patients. Twenty-six subjects were assigned randomly to therapy with olanzapine or risperidone for 14 days. The metabolic parameters were quantitatively assessed by using the intravenous glucose tolerance test. The levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, lipid profiles, and leptin were also assessed. There were no significant within-group changes in weight or body mass index for both groups after 2 weeks of treatment. The levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, cholesterol, or leptin did not change in both groups. The triglyceride level significantly increased in olanzapine group. Glucose disappearance rate and insulin sensitivity did not change in both groups. Insulin secretion significantly decreased in olanzapine group. After 2 weeks of olanzapine treatment, schizophrenic patients decreased insulin secretory response to a hyperglycemic challenge. The results of this study support the hypothesis that olanzapine might directly impair pancreatic beta-cell function.",

In this 6-month, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial, patients were randomized to treatment with OLZ (n = 171, 10-20 mg/d) or QUE (n = 175, 300-700 mg/d). Patients were treated at community mental health centers and assigned case managers who developed individualized psychosocial treatment plans. The primary efficacy measure was the reduction in negative symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Secondary measures assessed changes in functioning, psychopathology, and treatment tolerability. Treatment with OLZ or QUE led to a significant reduction in negative symptoms, with no between-group difference (P = 0.09). Both treatment groups also showed significant improvement on most efficacy measures. Olanzapine-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement on positive symptoms and on several measures of functioning including Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, Quality of Life Instrumental Role domain, and level of effort in psychosocial or occupational rehabilitation programs. Significantly more OLZ-treated patients completed the study (52.6% OLZ, 37.7% QUE, P = 0.007). Treatment differences in safety were relatively small and not thought to be clinically relevant. Patients with schizophrenia who manifest prominent negative symptoms and marked functional deficits demonstrated significant improvement in negative symptoms after treatment with OLZ or QUE. Greater improvement in positive symptoms and a greater study completion rate may hold relevance to enhanced functional outcomes observed after OLZ therapy.", 
    "22": "Cholesterol is the starting point for biosynthesis of steroids, oxysterols and bile acids, and is also an essential component of cellular membranes. The mechanisms directing the intracellular trafficking of this insoluble molecule have received attention through the discovery of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and related proteins containing StAR-related lipid transfer domains. Much of our understanding of the physiology of StAR derives from studies of congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, which is caused by StAR mutations. Multiple lines of evidence show that StAR moves cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane, but acts exclusively on the outer membrane. The precise mechanism by which StAR's action on the outer mitochondrial membrane stimulates the flow of cholesterol to the inner membrane remains unclear. When StAR interacts with protonated phospholipid head groups on the outer mitochondrial membrane, it undergoes a conformational change (molten globule transition) that opens and closes StAR's cholesterol-binding pocket; this conformational change is required for cholesterol binding, which is required for StAR activity. The action of StAR probably requires interaction with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor.",

However, the first synthesis had some drawbacks regarding reagents, processes, and overall yield, which furthermore decreased when the synthesis was scaled up. Therefore, we now report a new synthetic route for this compound which requires fewer steps and is suited for large-scale production. This compound significantly relieved the symptoms of neuromuscular deficit in mnd mice, a model of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis with motor neuron dysfunction. After oral administration, the concentrations of the compound in the brain and spinal cord were about threefold higher than those in the plasma. In summary, this novel AMPA antagonist is accessible through an optimized synthetic route, has good neurobehavioral activity, oral bioavailability, and favorable brain penetration. This opens new possibilities for the treatment of devastating neurological diseases that are mediated by the AMPA receptor.", 
    "32": "The role of benzodiazepine derivatives (BZD) as a privileged scaffold that mimics beta-turn structures (Ripka et al. (1993) Tetrahedron 49:3593-3608) in peptide/protein recognition was reexamined in detail. Stable BZD ring conformers were determined with MM3, and experimental reverse-turn structures were extracted from the basis set of protein crystal structures previously defined by Ripka et al. Ideal beta-turns were also modeled and similarly compared with BZD conformers. Huge numbers of conformers were generated by systematically scanning the torsional degrees of freedom for BZDs, as well as those of ideal beta-turns for comparison. Using these structures, conformers of BZDs were fit to experimental structures as suggested by Ripka et al., or modeled classical beta-turn conformers, and the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values were calculated for each pairwise comparison. Pairs of conformers with the smallest RMSD values for overlap of the four alpha-beta side-chain orientations were selected. All overlaps of BZD conformers with experimental beta-turns yielded one or more comparisons where the least RMSD was significantly small, 0.48-0.86 angstroms, as previously suggested. Utilizing a different methodology, the overall conclusion that benzodiazepines could serve as reverse-turn mimetics of Ripka et al. is justified. The least RMSD values for the overlap of BZDs and modeled classical beta-turns were also less than 1 angstrom. When comparing BZDs with experimental or classical beta-turns, the set of experimental beta-turns selected by Ripka et al. fit the BZD scaffolds better than modeled classical beta-turns; however, all the experimental beta-turns did not fit a particular BZD scaffold better. A single BZD ring conformation, and/or chiral orientation, can mimic some, but not all, of the experimental beta-turn structures. BZD has two central ring conformations and one chiral center that explains why the four variations of the BZD scaffold can mimic all types of beta-turn structure examined. It was found, moreover, that the BZD scaffold also mimics each of the nine clusters of experimental orientations of side chains of reverse turns in the Protein Data Bank, when the new classification scheme for the four side-chain directions (the relative orientations of alpha-beta vectors of residues i through i+3) was considered (Tran et al. (2005) J Comput-Aided Mol Des 19:551-566).",

    "38": "Studies using mice with point mutations of GABA(A) receptor alpha subunits suggest that the sedative and anxiolytic properties of 1,4-benzodiazepines are mediated, respectively, by GABA(A) receptors bearing the alpha(1) and alpha(2) subunits. This hypothesis predicts that a compound with high efficacy at GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha(1) subunit would produce sedation, whereas an agonist acting at alpha(2) subunit-containing receptors (with low or null efficacy at alpha(1)-containing receptors) would be anxioselective. Electrophysiological studies using recombinant GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes indicate that maximal potentiation of GABA-stimulated currents by the pyrazolo-[1,5-a]-pyrimidine, DOV 51892, at alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) constructs of the GABA(A) receptor was significantly higher (148%) than diazepam. In contrast, DOV 51892 was considerably less efficacious and/or potent than diazepam in enhancing GABA-stimulated currents mediated by constructs containing alpha(2), alpha(3), or alpha(5) subunits. In vivo, DOV 51892 increased punished responding in the Vogel conflict test, an effect blocked by flumazenil, and increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. However, DOV 51892 had no consistent effects on motor function or muscle relaxation at doses more than 1 order of magnitude greater than the minimal effective anxiolytic dose. Although the mutant mouse data predict that the high-efficacy potentiation of GABA(A1a) receptor-mediated currents by DOV 51892 would be sedating, behavioral studies demonstrate that DOV 51892 is anxioselective, indicating that GABA potentiation mediated by alpha(1) subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors may be neither the sole mechanism nor highly predictive of the sedative properties of benzodiazepine recognition site modulators.",

The CSP mice presented (1) decreased levels and increased turnover of hypothalamic NA; (2) decreased neutrophil oxidative burst after PMA or Staphylococcus aureus induction; (3) decreased percentage and intensity of neutrophil phagocytosis. In CSP mice, diazepam induced no changes in neutrophil oxidative burst or intensity of phagocytosis, but abolished almost completely the percentage of neutrophils performing phagocytosis.

    "54": "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a disorder characterized by progressive muscle rigidity with superimposed painful muscle spasms and gait impairment due to continuous motor activity. Evidence has accumulated in favor of SPS representing an autoimmune, predominantly encephalomyelopathic disorder resulting from B-cell-mediated clonal production of autoantibodies against presynaptic inhibitory epitopes on the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and the synaptic membrane protein amphiphysin. Recognition of the clinical spectrum of SPS is important, particularly the upper-limb, cervical, and cranial nerve involvement that occurs in paraneoplastic variants. The correlation between antibody levels and severity of disease offers evidence for a pathogenic role for the anti-GAD and anti-amphiphysin autoantibodies. The scarcity of neuropathological correlates stand in sharp contrast with the severity of the disability in affected individuals and suggests that functional impairment of inhibitory circuits without structural damage is sufficient to develop the full clinical spectrum of SPS. The rarity of this condition limits the feasibility of controlled clinical trials in the treatment of SPS, but the available evidence suggest that drugs that increase cortical and spinal inhibition such as benzodiazepines and drugs that provide immune modulation such as intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and prednisone are effective treatments.",

Two blind, independent observers scored each test (presence/absence of drug) in accordance with kit instructions; chi 2 was used to compare the proportion of times raters scored tests correctly and incorrectly. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated overall, for each drink, and sensitivity was calculated for each drug. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated using the kappa statistic.", 
    "59": "While both raters were able to score significantly more tests correctly than incorrectly using Drink Detective, and one rater scored similarly using Drink Guard, the overall sensitivity of Drink Detective and Drink Guard was 69.0% (95% CI 64.2-73.5%) and 37.5% (95% CI 30.1-45.5%), respectively. Sensitivity was drink-dependent. Drink Detective was unable to detect our dose of GHB in water, with all tests scored negatively by both raters for this drink/drug combination (n = 20 negative scores). Overall, specificity was 76.6% (95% CI 71.5-81.0%) and 87.9% (95% CI 83.0-91.6%) for Drink Guard and Drink Detective, respectively, but was affected by the beverage. Inter-rater agreement was poor for Drink Guard (kappa = 0.278 +/- 0.069) but excellent for Drink Detective (kappa = 0.894 +/- 0.245). Inter-observer agreement was drug-dependent.",

    "61": "This article reviews three of the involuntary hyperkinetic motor disorders that affect the orofacial region, namely orofacial dystonia, oromandibular dyskinesia, as well as medication-induced extrapyramidal syndrome-dystonic reactions. Specifically, it discusses and contrasts the clinical features and management strategies for spontaneous primary and drug-induced motor disorders in the orofacial region. The article provides a list of medications reported to cause drug-related extrapyramidal motor activity above and beyond the more commonly known antipsychotics medications. It provides a needed update because the number and use of medications causing involuntary jaw muscle activity are increasing. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), stimulant medications and illegal drugs have all been reported to induce an orofacial motor activation as adverse reactions. This article also discusses briefly the genetic and traumatic events associated with spontaneous dystonia. Finally, this article presents an approach for management of the orofacial motor disorders that involves the following three steps: (1) collect a full clinical history and examination, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain; (2) after ruling out CNS disease, adverse medications reactions and local pathology, try one or more of the motor-suppressive medications that may be helpful in these cases (e.g., cholinergic receptor antagonizers or blockers, and GABA-ergic including benzodiazepines); and (3) if the disorder is severe enough and focal enough to consider, and motor-suppressive medications are not adequate, then consider botulinum toxin injections. The contraindications, side effects, and usual approach for these medications and injections are discussed.", 
    "62": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by complex behavioral manifestations in response to dream content that may cause sleep disruption or injuries to the patient or the bed partner. In this case, the patients need treatment to control their symptoms. Pharmacologic agents have been reported to have positive and negative impacts on REM sleep muscle atonia and the motor behaviors associated with RBD. Clonazepam is efficacious and well tolerated by the majority of patients afflicted by RBD and should be considered as initial treatment. In patients at risk of falls who have cognitive impairment or who have obstructive sleep apneas, melatonin may be a good alternative to clonazepam. Anticholinesterase inhibitors and dopaminergic agents are not of clear benefit. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic synaptic reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic antagonists can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms and should be avoided in patients with RBD. When these agents are prescribed to patients with neurodegenerative disorders or narcolepsy who are at risk of developing RBD, systematic follow-up may be warranted to detect the emergence of RBD symptoms.",

All of the children received oral oxycodone 0.2 mg/kg (max: 15 mg) at triage > or = 45 minutes before reduction. Videotapes were obtained before (baseline), during (procedure), and after (recovery) reduction and scored using the Procedure Behavioral Checklist by an observer blinded to study purpose. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in Procedure Behavioral Checklist score from baseline to procedure, with greater change indicating greater procedure distress. Other outcome measures of efficacy included recovery times and visual analog scale scores to assess patient distress, parent report of child distress, and orthopedic surgeon satisfaction with sedation. Adverse effects were assessed during the emergency visit and by telephone 1 day after reduction. Data were analyzed using repeated measures, that is, analysis of variance, chi2, and t tests.",

There was no difference in age, race, gender, and baseline Procedure Behavioral Checklist scores between ketamine/midazolam (55 subjects) and nitrous oxide/hematoma block (47 subjects). Mean changes in Procedure Behavioral Checklist scores were very small for both groups. The mean change in Procedure Behavioral Checklist was less for nitrous oxide/hematoma block, and patients and parents reported less pain during fracture reduction with nitrous oxide/hematoma block. Recovery times were markedly shorter for nitrous oxide/hematoma block compared with ketamine/midazolam. Orthopedic surgeons were similarly satisfied with the 2 regimens. Of the ketamine/midazolam subjects, 11% had O2 saturations < 94%. Other adverse effects occurred in both groups, but more often in ketamine/midazolam both during the emergency visit and at 1-day follow-up.",

    "67": "The pathology associated with late-stage dementia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been studied extensively. Neuropathological examination has demonstrated abundant activation and infection of macrophages/microglia termed HIV encephalitis. For obvious reasons, less is known regarding the neuropathology of minor cognitive impairment seen in earlier stages of HIV infection. The authors examined the utility of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand PK11195 in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess microglial/macrophage activation in the brains of HIV-infected subjects with minor neurocognitive impairment in a cross-sectional study of 12 HIV infected individuals and 5 age-matched noninfected controls. Subjects were given a battery of neuropsychological tests in addition to assessing CD4 T-cell count and peripheral viremia followed by contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET with [15O]H2O followed by [11C](R)-PK11195. Two of the six neurocognitively impaired HIV-infected subjects demonstrated plasma viral breakthrough, whereas only one of six nonimpaired individuals demonstrated plasma viral load near the limits of detection. MRI demonstrated no abnormal enhancement and although atrophy was more prominent in impaired subjects, it was also present though to a lesser extent in nonimpaired subjects. None of the 12 HIV-infected subjects demonstrated increased retention of [11C](R)-PK11195 in the brain parenchyma compared to the 5 controls. These results suggest that either [11C](R)-PK11195 PET assessment is insensitive to the degree of macrophage activation in HIV-associated minor neurocognitive impairment or macrophage activation is not the pathological substrate of this neurological condition.", 
    "68": "Compared with their contemporaries, individuals abusing illicit drugs suffer a higher risk of premature death. In Sweden, a simple protocol for registration of fatalities among abusers of alcohol, pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, or other substances, has been used by the forensic pathologists since 2001. This routine was introduced to allow for an evaluation of the cause and manner of death, and patterns of abuse among different groups of abusers. We explored the data on drug abusers (i.e. abusers of illicit drugs) subjected to a forensic autopsy 2002-2003. The Swedish forensic pathologists examined 10,273 dead victims during the study period and 7% (743/10,273) of the cases were classified as drug abusers. Toxicological analyses were carried out in 99% (736/743) and illicit drugs were detected in 70% (514/736) of these. On average, 3.8 substances (legal or illegal) were found per case. The most common substances were ethanol and morphine, detected in 43 and 35% of the cases, respectively. When exploring the importance of the different substances for the cause of death, we found that the detection of some substances, such as fentanyl and morphine, strongly indicated a poisoning, whereas certain other substances, such as benzodiazepines more often were incidental findings. In total, 50% (372/743) died of poisoning, whereas only 22% (161/743) died of natural causes. Death was considered to be directly or indirectly due to drug abuse in 47% (346/743), whereas evidence of drug abuse was an incidental finding in 21% (153/743) or based on case history alone in 33% (244/743). We believe that this strategy to prospectively categorize deaths among drug addicts constitutes a simple means of standardizing the surveillance of the death toll among drug addicts that could allow for comparisons over time and between countries.",

Among mixed-episode patients with residual suicidality (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-item 3 [HAM-D-3] score of 1 or above) at randomization to cotherapy, we identified items in the Young Mania Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale that correlated with HAM-D-3 scores. We used factor analysis of correlated items to identify symptom domains associated with suicidality ratings and assessed changes in symptom factors and HAM-D-3 scores during 6 weeks of combination therapy with olanzapine versus placebo.",

Factors associated with the HAM-D-3 appeared to represent somatic discomfort, agitated depression, and psychotic features. Combination therapy with olanzapine (N = 36) versus placebo (N = 22) differentially reduced HAM-D-3 scores by 58% versus 29% (p < .05) within 1 week, and all 3 associated symptom factors within 2 weeks by averages of 31% versus 12% (p < .05).",

    "75": "After maximizing the safety of all individuals in the presence of an acutely agitated patient, initial therapy generally involves verbal deescalation. Pharmacologic management of acute agitation relies on typical antipsychotics, particularly haloperidol; benzodiazepines; and atypical antipsychotics. The selection of a specific agent (or combination of agents) should be guided by etiologic considerations, efficacy of the drug(s), side effects, potential drug interactions, and drug formulation. Seclusion or restraints are treatments of last resort due to safety issues.", 
    "76": "Compared with conventional antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol), preliminary evidence indicates that atypical antipsychotics effectively reduce agitation, are better tolerated, and have fewer side effects. After an acute episode, atypical agents also help ease the transition from intramuscular to oral medication to promote ongoing treatment.", 
    "77": "The effect of a benzodiazepine partial agonist bretazenil on cortical epileptic afterdischarges was studied in 12-, 18- or 25-day-old rat pups with implanted electrodes. Afterdischarges were induced by low-frequency stimulation of sensorimotor area four times in each animal and bretazenil (0.1; 1; 5; 10; or 25 mg/kg) and/or solvent were administered intraperitoneally between the first and second stimulation. Bretazenil was able to decrease the duration of afterdischarges as well as intensity of clonic seizures accompanying these afterdischarges in all age groups in a dose-dependent manner. The efficacy of bretazenil was age-dependent: the most marked effect on duration of afterdischarges was observed in 25-day-old rats. It is in sharp contrast with our earlier data for full agonists clonazepam and midazolam demonstrating the strongest action in the youngest group.", 
    "78": "Clozapine demonstrates superior efficacy in patients with schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms contributing to this clinical advantage are not clear. Clozapine and olanzapine increase the GABAergic neuroactive steroid (NS) allopregnanolone, and it has been hypothesized that NS induction may contribute to the therapeutic actions of these agents. Pregnenolone administration improves learning and memory in rodent models, and decreases in this NS have been associated with depressive symptoms in humans. These pregnenolone characteristics may be relevant to the actions of antipsychotics. We therefore investigated potential pregnenolone alterations in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex following clozapine, olanzapine, and other second generation agents as a candidate NS mechanism contributing to antipsychotic efficacy. In the first set of experiments, intact, adrenalectomized, and sham-operated male rats received vehicle or clozapine (20 mg/kg) IP. In the second set, male rats received vehicle, olanzapine (5 mg/kg), quetiapine (20 mg/kg), ziprasidone (10 mg/kg) or aripiprazole (5 mg/kg) IP. Pregnenolone levels were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Clozapine markedly elevates pregnenolone in rat hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and serum; hippocampal levels were strongly correlated with serum levels (r=0.987). Olanzapine also elevates pregnenolone levels, but to a lesser degree than clozapine. Pregnenolone induction may contribute to the clinical actions of clozapine and olanzapine.", 
    "79": "RY-080 (ethyl 8-ethynyl-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) is an imidazobenzodiazepine with 40-50-fold higher affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site of alpha5- rather than alpha1-, alpha2- or alpha3-containing GABAA receptors. Previous data describing RY-080 as being convulsant suggests that inverse agonists selective for the alpha5 subtype may not be suitable for clinical development. In the present study, we show that RY-080 possesses inverse agonism for the alpha1 and alpha5 subtypes of human recombinant GABAA receptors and whilst not convulsant it was proconvulsant. Hence, with pentylenetetrazole alone, the dose predicted to give tonic convulsions in 50% of the mice (ED50) was 108 mg/kg whereas in the presence of 1 and 10 mg/kg RY-080, the ED50s were 93 and 57 mg/kg, respectively. In vivo [3H]L-655,708 and [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding assays showed that the subtype selectivity of RY-080 in vivo was 7-10-fold for alpha5-relative to alpha1- and alpha2/alpha3-containing receptors (respective ID50 values of 0.93, 9.7 and 6.2 mg/kg) and is therefore much lower than seen in vitro. Consequently, it is not possible to define a dose of RY-080 which gives high occupancy of the alpha5 subtype without binding to other subtypes and accordingly the proconvulsant effects of RY-080 cannot be attributed solely to the alpha5 subtype.", 
    "80": "Lipofuscin is an autofluorescent and undegradable material, which accumulates in tissues during ageing and under different types of stress. Among these, oxidative stress represents a major trigger for lipofuscin formation. However, prolonged noise exposure is also an effective stressful stimuli. Diazepam may inhibit lipofuscinogenesis in liver and prevent the noise-induced reduction of the steroidogenesis in the adrenal gland. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether chronic noise exposure causes lipofuscin accumulation in mouse testis, and to evaluate the effects of diazepam administration. Eight-week old mice were either exposed for 6 weeks (6 h day(-1)) to white-noise (group A), or received diazepam (3 mg kg(-1), i.p.) before noise exposures (group B), while a further group was used as control (group C). Light fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy revealed lipofuscin in large amounts in the Leydig cells in mice of group A, which concomitantly had low serum testosterone levels; pre-treatment with diazepam occluded both effects. The present study indicates that: (i) chronic noise exposure causes lipofuscin accumulation at the level of the Leydig cells and a decrease in testosterone; (ii) all these effects are suppressed by pre-treatment with diazepam. As the Leydig cells represent the only cellular type of the interstitial testicular tissue having peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, these results could be explained by the capacity of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors to prevent reactive oxygen species damage and to increase the resistance of these cells to oxidative stress.", 
    "81": "Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) and fluorous mixture synthesis (FMS) are two aspects of combinatorial chemistry. DOS generates library scaffolds with skeletal, substitution, and stereochemistry variations, whereas FMS is a highly efficient tool for library production. The combination of these two aspects in solution-phase synthesis of two novel heterocyclic compound libraries is presented in this paper. Mixtures of different fluorous amino acids undergo [3 + 2] cycloadditions followed by postcondensation reactions. The mixtures are then demixed by fluorous HPLC. Fluorous tags are removed by cyclization to afford hydantoin- and benzodiazepinedione-fused heterocyclic compounds as individual, pure, and structurally defined molecules. The application of MS-directed HPLC purification and parallel four-channel LC/MS analysis further increases the efficiency of FMS.",

Approximately 1 in 25 patients (4.12%) of all the patients prescribed hypnotics received duplicate treatment, 1 in 8 an inappropriately (12.27%) high dosage (daily dose > 1.5 DDD, Defined Daily Dose), 1 in 3 (32.25%) more than 28 DDD per prescription and 1 in 6 (17.52%) a drug with an effect which was too prolonged. Physicians tended to consider patient gender but not age when prescribing. Clear trends were found between the specialty of the physician and the type of inappropriate prescribing. The type of medical institution was significantly related only to the excessive quantity of medication prescribed.", 
    "85": "Elderly people in Taiwan with insomnia receive potentially inappropriate prescriptions for sleep medications. Similar data could possibly be extracted from similar databases in other countries throughout the world. Some of these potentially inappropriate prescriptions are avoidable in terms of restricting the length of outpatient sedative-hypnotic treatment, introducing hypnotics in small dosage forms and continuously educating clinicians on the safety of geriatric medication.",

    "91": "To investigate the effects of bromazepam on motor performance and electroencephalographic activity (qEEG) in healthy subjects, during the process of learning a typewriting task, with a focused attention demand. A randomized double-blind model was used to allocate subjects in one of the following conditions: placebo (n=13), bromazepam 3 mg (n=13) or bromazepam 6 mg (n=13). Forty minutes after treatment administration, subjects were submitted to the motor task. EEG activity was recorded simultaneously. The analyzed variables were: number of errors and execution time, which were extracted from each block of the typewriting task, and mean relative power values in the beta band (13-35 Hz), extracted from the qEEG. A significantly lower number of typing errors was observed in both bromazepam conditions (Br 3 mg and Br 6 mg) when compared to the placebo. There was no difference between the two bromazepam conditions. For the execution time variable, a better performance was observed in the Br 3 mg condition, but with no statistical significance. The highest degree of cortical activation during the task was observed in Br 3 mg and Br 6 mg when compared to placebo. The medication's anxiolytic effect intensifies the attentional focus over predictable events occurring in reduced perceptual fields. The qEEG's accentuated response in pre-motor and primary motor areas suggests a greater effort directed to the most relevant aspects of the task. In short, the doses employed (3 and 6 mg) seem to enhance the learning of motor tasks that involve focused attention, such as typewriting.",

In this study, the presence of benzodiazepines detected by liquid chromatography-(tandem) mass spectrometry [LC-MS(-MS)] in oral fluid and urine samples obtained from drivers stopped during a roadside survey was compared. In addition, the sensitivity and selectivity of enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT II Plus) relative to LC-MS(-MS) was determined for both matrices. A total number of 1,011 urine samples were collected and screened for benzodiazepines using immunoassay (IA) (EMIT II Plus; cutoff 300 ng/mL). In the IA-positive (n = 25) and a group of randomly selected negative urine samples (n = 79), the presence or absence of benzodiazepines was confirmed by LC-MS-MS after deglucuronidation. The corresponding oral fluid samples (n = 101, 3 samples omitted), were analyzed by LC-MS(-MS) and IA (EMIT II Plus; cutoff 10 ng/mL). The presence of benzodiazepines was demonstrated by LC-MS-(MS) in all IA-positive urine samples, but in only four corresponding oral fluid samples. Concentrations in oral fluid were, one substance excepted, lower than in urine. The sensitivity and specificity of EMIT II Plus were better by using urine as matrix for screening of benzodiazepines than by using oral fluid. The results show that benzodiazepines are detectable in oral fluid. More research has to be done to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the different benzodiazepines in oral fluid and to study the relationship between dose, concentration (in oral fluid and blood), and impairment.",

Upon contact with law enforcement, she was still confused and could hardly explain the facts. She told authorities that she had been kidnapped 4 h previously when two individuals with covered faces put a cloth soaked in a solvent over her mouth. She spent a few hours in a room, during which she lost consciousness. The girl awakened semi-nude in the street with memory loss. No alcohol was present in the subject's body; no odor of alcohol was detected on the subject's breath. No lesions were observed during a gynecological exam. A blood sample was taken with the intent to investigate the use of chloroform or similar anesthetics. Toxicological analysis of the victim's blood revealed the presence of 7.6 mg/L of benzene, 24.8 mg/L of toluene, and 0.6 mg/L of xylene (mixture of isomers). As for other analytical findings, diazepam (0.02 mg/L) was also found. The aromatic solvents involved in this case were detected using gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) and confirmed using GC-mass spectrometry (MS) in full scan mode after liquid-liquid extraction of the whole blood sample. Quantitation of the aromatic solvents was carried out using GC-FID. Diazepam was detected using GC with nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD) and confirmed using GC-MS with full scan mode after solid-phase extraction of the whole blood sample using Bond-Elut Certify columns. Quantitation of diazepam was carried out using GC-NPD. No other drugs, including ethanol, were detected. Recoveries for benzene, toluene, and xylene (mixture of isomers) in whole blood at 5 mg/L were 89.2%, 90.8%, and 93.4%, respectively. Intraday precisions were 5.3%, 5.0%, and 4.9%, respectively, and interday precisions were 12.1%, 11.6%, and 11.5%, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) were 30 and 100 microg/L, respectively. The linearity of the blood calibration curves was excellent with r(2) values of > 0.999 (range 0.1-10 mg/L). Recovery for diazepam in whole blood at 0.5 mg/L was 88.2% with intraday and interday precisions of 2.0% and 10.8%, respectively. The LOD and LOQ were 6 and 20 microg/L, respectively. The linearity of the blood calibration curve was excellent with r(2) values of > 0.999 (range 0.1-2 mg/L).

To examine clinical effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on tapering BDZ use in non-depressive patients, 97 outpatients with a history of BDZ use for at least 3 months were recruited at an internal medicine clinic of a university hospital. After the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) clinical interviews for screening major depression, 66 outpatients (68%) without the DSM-IV major depression were randomly assigned to one of three groups: SSRI-assisted BDZ-reduction group (10-20 mg of paroxetine, n = 22), simple BDZ-reduction group (no paroxetine, n = 23), and reference group (no BDZ-reduction, n = 21). A standardized 8-week program involving gradual BDZ discontinuation was performed in the two BDZ-reduction groups. The Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) and the BDZ Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire were assessed during the intervention period. Those with major depression were excluded from the BDZ-reduction intervention and treated with a different protocol of medication. In total, 10 (45.5%) in the SSRI-assisted BDZ-reduction group (n = 22) succeeded in becoming BDZ-free after completing the program, whereas only four (17.4%) in the simple BDZ-reduction group (n = 23) succeeded. The assistance of the SSRI significantly predicted the success of becoming BDZ-free (P = 0.023), controlling for the effects of age, gender, period of BDZ use, and baseline HAM-D and HAM-A scores. The score changes on the three questionnaires were comparable (all P > 0.05) among the three groups during the intervention period. The use of SSRI may have beneficial effects on BDZ withdrawal without the worsening of mood states in cases without major depression.",

    "100": "Buprenorphine is an opioid agonist-antagonist with a 'ceiling effect' for respiratory depression. Compared with methadone, its unique pharmacology offers practical advantages and enhanced safety when prescribed as recommended and supervised by a physician. Buprenorphine has been approved in several countries as an efficient and safe maintenance therapy for heroin addiction. Its use resulted in a salutary effect with a reduction in heroin overdose-related deaths in countries that implemented office-based buprenorphine maintenance. In France, however, where high-dose buprenorphine has been marketed since 1996, several cases of asphyxic deaths were reported among addicts treated with buprenorphine. Death resulted from buprenorphine intravenous misuse or concomitant sedative drug ingestion, such as benzodiazepines. In these situations of abuse, misuse, or in association with elevated doses of psychotropic drugs, buprenorphine may cause severe respiratory depression. Unlike other opiates, the respiratory effects from buprenorphine are not responsive to naloxone. However, the exact mechanism of buprenorphine-induced effects on ventilation is still unknown. The role of norbuprenorphine, the main N-dealkylated buprenorphine metabolite with potent respiratory depressor activity, also remains unclear. Experimental studies investigating the respiratory effects of combinations of high doses of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines suggested that this drug-drug interaction may result from a pharmacodynamic interaction. A pharmacokinetic interaction between buprenorphine and flunitrazepam is also considered. As there are many questions regarding the possible dangers of death or respiratory depression associated with buprenorphine use, we aimed to present a comprehensive critical review of the published clinical and experimental studies on buprenorphine respiratory effects.",

For PBR binding affinity, molar refractivity (MR) shows a parabolic relation with binding affinity suggesting that binding affinity increases with increase in volume of the compounds, until it reaches the critical value, after which the affinity decreases. The negative coefficients of S_aaN and S_ssNH indicate that binding affinity increases with decrease in E-state value of (N/) (aromatic nitrogen) and HN< (secondary amino group) fragments. The coefficient of 3XVC and JX term indicates the importance of shape and branching for binding affinity. For CBR binding affinity, lipophilicity of molecules is detrimental to the binding affinity, while presence of hydrogen at Y position is conducive to the activity. Selectivity pattern of these ligands for peripheral (cortex) over central receptors requires the presence and absence of methyl group at R2 and R3 positions respectively, and shows the importance of MR and shape parameter. Similarly, selectivity of these ligands for peripheral (ovary) over central receptors requires the presence and absence of methyl group at R2 and R3 positions respectively, presence of phenyl group at R1 and R2 positions and selectivity relation shows importance of MR, shape and branching.",

In control cells expressing alphabetagamma receptors alone, GABA activated single channels whose main conductance was 30 picosiemens (pS) with a subconductance state of 20 pS, and increasing the GABA concentration did not alter their conductance. In contrast, when GABA(A) receptors were co-expressed with GABARAP, the GABA-activated single channels displayed multiple, high conductances (> or =40 pS), and GABA (> or =10 microM) was able to increase their conductance, up to a maximum of 60 pS. The mean open time of GABA-activated channels in control cells expressing alphabetagamma receptors alone was 2.3 +/- 0.1 ms for the main 30-pS channel and shorter for the subconductance state (20 pS, 0.8 +/- 0.1 ms). Similar values were measured for the 30- and 20-pS channels active in patches from cells co-expressing GABARAP. However higher conductance channels (> or =40 pS) remained open longer, irrespective of whether GABA or GABA plus diazepam activated them. Plotting mean open times against mean conductances revealed a linear relationship between these two parameters. Since high GABA concentrations increase both the maximum single channel conductance and mean open time of GABA(A) channels co-expressed with GABARAP, trafficking processes must influence ion channel properties. This suggests that the organization of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may provide a range of distinct inhibitory currents in the brain and, further, provide differential drug responses.",

Variation in GABA(A) receptor subunit genes may contribute to the vulnerability to alcoholism, particularly in the context of environmental risk factors. Alcohol dependence is associated with time-dependent changes in brain GABA(A) receptor density and subunit gene expression levels that contribute to a withdrawal-related deficit in GABA(A) receptor function. However, cortical GABA levels are not reduced during acute withdrawal. Benzodiazepine-assisted detoxification enhances a phasic component of GABA function. However, novel treatments target the tonic component of GABA neurotransmission mediated by benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA(A) receptors. Smoking attenuates withdrawal-related disturbances in brain GABA function, perhaps contributing to comorbid nicotine and alcohol dependence. The GABA systems show recovery with long-term sobriety.",

This study was conducted to investigate the influence of pharmacologically induced-anxiety on nociception and antinociception. Experimental anxiety levels were measured using the rat burying behavior test. Diazepam (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or yohimbine (0, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) were used as anxiolytic or anxiogenic drugs, respectively. To evaluate the influence of different experimental anxiety levels on nociception, the pain-induced functional impairment in the rat (PIFIR model) was used. Nociception was induced by an intra-articular injection of 15% uric acid into the knee joint of the right hind limb. Diazepam or yohimbine were administered 15 min before uric acid and the ability of the rat to use the injured hind limb was recorded. To analyze the influence of different levels of anxiety on the antinociceptive effects produced by acetylsalicylic acid (0, 31, 100 and 310 mg/kg, p.o.); this analgesic was administered 3.5 h after uric acid. Fifteen min before diazepam (2.0 mg/kg) or yohimbine (1.0 mg/kg) were administered. We found that, in the burying behavior test, diazepam and yohimbine produced a dose-dependent decrease or augment in the cumulative time of burying, effects denoting reduced or increased experimental anxiety, respectively. Diazepam or yohimbine, administered alone, was unable to produce nociception. The results showed an influence of anxiety on nociception since a decreased (by diazepam) or increased (by yohimbine) experimental anxiety prevented nociception. Control experiments showed that acetylsalicylic acid did not modify experimental anxiety in the burying behavior test, but effectively reversed the nociception induced by uric acid (15%) in the PIFIR model. Such antinociceptive effect was unmodified by the anxiolytic or anxiogenic actions of diazepam or yohimbine.

Five to six weeks after the beta40 injection, the rats showed learning deficits in the Morris water maze task and neuronal damage in the hippocampus, although the injection of beta40 or ibotenate alone did not result in cognitive deficits and hippocampal damage. Memantine (10, 20 mg/kg/day s.c. infusion for 6 weeks starting 24 h before the beta40 injection) significantly prevented learning deficits as measured for 4 days from 5 weeks after the beta40 injection, while a lower dose of memantine (5 mg/kg/day) and MK-801 (0.312, 0.624 mg/kg/day) did not have inhibitory effects on the learning deficits. The neuronal damage in the hippocampus, assessed as an elevation of the levels of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine-binding site (a gliosis marker for neuronal damage) produced by sequential intra-hippocampal injections of beta40 and ibotenate, at 6 weeks (39 days) after the beta40 injection, was significantly attenuated by memantine (10, 20 mg/kg/day) and MK-801 (0.624 mg/kg/day). These protective effects were also confirmed by histochemical examination (Cresyl violet staining of brain slices). In naive rats, MK-801 produced a significant learning impairment in the water maze task at a dose of 0.624 mg/kg/day, while memantine (20 mg/kg/day s.c. infusion) did not, although the beta40 plus ibotenate-induced hippocampal damage was lessened by both treatments. These results suggest that memantine and MK-801 exert protective effects on progressive neuronal damage, but that only memantine prevents memory impairment in hippocampal-lesioned rats, and that memantine may be a beneficial agent for the treatment of progressive cognitive dysfunction including Alzheimer's disease-type dementia.",

Drugs with diverse pharmacological properties alter head dipping suggesting that many neurotransmitter systems are involved in the expression of exploratory behavior. The aim of the current experiments was to determine the effects of several drugs from different classes on head dipping, and to compare the effects of some of these agents in lines of mice that have been selectively bred for divergent expression of head dipping on a hole-board. In the current experiments, the effects on head dipping of three doses each of fluoxetine, desipramine, GBR-12909, methamphetamine, pentylenetetrazol, and diazepam were evaluated in genetically heterogeneous mice. Most drugs altered the number of head dips in a predictable manner, but the effects on locomotion were generally as large as those seen for head dipping. Locomotion could completely account for the effects of fluoxetine and pentylenetetrazol, and to a lesser extent, diazepam. We have also developed replicate lines of mice selectively bred for high (High Exploratory Behavior: HEB) or low (Low Exploratory Behavior: LEB) head dipping on a hole-board and evaluated the effects of diazepam and methamphetamine on hole-board behaviors in these mice. Diazepam increased head dipping and locomotion equivalently in both lines of mice, but methamphetamine stimulated locomotion in HEB mice more than in LEB mice. These results broadly suggest that the effects of most drugs we tested are not specific for head dipping, since almost all drugs tested affected head dipping and locomotion equivalently. However, the results with the genetically heterogeneous mice and HEB and LEB mice suggest that some aspects of the dopaminergic system are involved in head dipping.",

Although it is considered safe for use in children, ketamine can increase intracranial pressure. Hence, this study was carried out to determine whether adding ketamine to midazolam prior to performing lumbar puncture would be associated with a higher cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure in children with suspected aseptic meningitis. Thirty-nine children aged 6 months to 14 years were included: 26 in group A (intravenous midazolam plus ketamine) and 13 in group B (intravenous midazolam only). Mean cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure in group A was 24.4 cm H2O (median 23 cm H2O) compared with 20 cm H2O (median 19.8 cm H2O) in group B (P = .011). Intravenous ketamine prior to performing lumbar puncture is associated with a significantly higher lumbar cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure in children with aseptic meningitis.

    "180": "Because urethane is a widely used anesthetic in animal experimentation, in the present study, we evaluated its effects on neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in brain stem slices from young rats (25-30 days old). Using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) were recorded. Urethane (20 mM) decreased by approximately 60% the frequency of GABAergic sPSCs (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 Hz) but did not change the frequency, amplitude, or half-width of glutamatergic events or TTX-resistant inhibitory sPSCs [miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs)]. Miniature IPSCs were measured in the presence of urethane plus 1 mM diazepam (1 mM), and no changes were seen in their amplitude. This suggests that the GABA concentration in the NTS synapses is set at saturating level. We also evaluated the effect of urethane on eEPSCs, and no significant change was observed in the amplitude of N-methyl-d-aspartate [NMDA; 44.2 +/- 11.5 vs. 37.6 +/- 10.6 pA (holding potential = 40 mV)] and non-NMDA currents [204.4 +/- 35.5 vs. 196.6 +/- 31.2 pA (holding potential = -70 mV)].

Nevertheless, various factors can expose this population to relevant levels of anxiety: development of somatic disorders, bereavements, isolation, changes of life, use of anxiogenic drugs, etc. Prevalence rates weaker than in the general population are usually found, but with high rates, however, for generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. The clinical aspect of these anxious states is often dominated by somatic symptoms and complaints, and some topics seem of special concern: fear of death and disease, displacement phobias related to the fear of falling or being attacked. Some consequences should be particularly watched over (diverse somatic affections, depression, dementia, and even suicidal tendencies), which justify an accurate clinical evaluation. Treatment must often be multidisciplinary involving medical but also psychological, and institutional aspects. The therapeutic strategies are largely identical to what they are in the other groups of age. Anxiolytic drugs and antidepressants, cognitive-behavioral therapies can be proposed, even if some adaptation of drug posology or methods of non pharmacological interventions should be needed. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of benzodiazepine dependence, drugs which are widely used by elderly subjects. As a conclusion, anxiety disorders in the elderly present clinical and therapeutic particularities, which require a special approach and the development of specific epidemiological, physiopathologic and therapeutic researches.",

Neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects of topiramate (TPM) associated with diazepam (DZP) were investigated in this model. SE was induced by LiCl and pilocarpine. TPM (10, 30 or 60 mg/kg) was injected at the onset of SE and 10h later and DZP (2.5 and 1.25mg/kg) at 2 and 10h after SE. TPM treatment was continued twice daily for 6 days. Other rats received two injections of DZP on the day of SE. Cell counting was performed on thionine-stained sections 14 days after SE and after 2 months of epilepsy. Occurrence and frequency of SRS were video-recorded. The MRI T2-weighted signal was quantified in hippocampus and ventral cortices. DZP-TPM treatment induced partial neuroprotection in CA1 and hilus, and tended to increase the percentage of rats with protected neurons in layer III/IV of the ventral entorhinal cortex. The latency to and frequency of SRS were not modified by DZP-TPM. T2-weighted signal was decreased in hippocampus 3 days after SE at all TPM doses and in ventral hippocampus after epilepsy onset. In conclusion, although DZP-TPM treatment was able to partially protect two areas critical for epileptogenesis, the hippocampus and ventral entorhinal cortex, it was not sufficient to prevent epileptogenesis.", 
    "185": "Nerve agents (NA) are simple and cheap to produce but can produce casualties on a massive scale. They have already been employed by terrorist organizations and rogue states on civilians and armed forces alike. By inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholine esterase, NAs prevent the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This results in over-stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the autonomic and central nervous systems and at the neuromuscular junction. Increased parasympathetic stimulation produces miosis, sialorrhea, bronchospasm and bronchorrhea. Effects at the neuromuscular junction cause weakness, fasciculations, and eventually paralysis. Central effects include altered behavior and mental status, loss of consciousness, seizures, or apnea. Most deaths are due to respiratory failure. Treatment with atropine competitively blocks the parasympathetic effects. Oximes like pralidoxime salvage acetylcholine esterase by \"prying off\" NA, provided the attachment has not \"aged\" to an irreversible bond. This reverses weakness. Benzodiazepines like diazepam are effective against NA induced seizures. Mortality has been surprisingly low. If victims can survive the first 15 to 20 min of a vapor attack, they will likely live. The low mortality rate to date underscores that attacks are survivable and research reveals even simple barriers such as clothing offer substantial protection. This article reviews the properties of NAs and how to recognize the clinical features of NA intoxication, employ the needed drugs properly, and screen out anxious patients who mistakenly believe they have been exposed.",

However, there is evidence suggesting that these effects could involve the activation of benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors but not the activation of a1-adrenergic receptors. The goal of this study was to analyse the effect of indorenate on a1-adrenergic and BZD receptor binding in specific rat brain areas by using in-vitro autoradiography. Coronal brain sections from male Wistar rats were used for labelling 5-HT1A (3H-8-OH-DPAT, 2 nM), a1-adrenergic (3H-prazosin, 2 nM) and BZD (3H-flunitrazepam, 2 nM) receptor binding in the presence or absence of indorenate (1 microM). Indorenate totally displaced 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding in all the brain areas evaluated. It decreased 3H-prazosin binding just in the frontal (30%) and sensorimotor (32%) cortices and in the thalamus (21%). Additionally, indorenate diminished 3H-flunitrazepam binding only in the cingulate (16%) and piriform (18%) cortices as well as in the dorsal raphe nucleus (18%).

When comparing moderate-dose clozapine with high-dose olanzapine, significantly lower muscarinic receptor availability was found for clozapine in all four cortical regions of interest.

Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 that reduce Iks cause long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a disorder of ventricular repolarization that results in cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. A well-recognized potential treatment for LQTS caused by reduction of Iks is to enhance functional activation of cardiac KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels. In the present study, we generated a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels confirmed by electrophysiology.

Patients were followed for just over 1 year. New-onset diabetes was identified through diagnostic codes and prescriptions for diabetes medication. In Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for potential confounders, with patients initiating haloperidol use designated the reference group, diabetes risk was increased equally with new use of olanzapine (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 2.19), risperidone (HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.14), or quetiapine (HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.76). Diabetes risks were higher in patients under age 50 years. When data were reanalyzed with prevalent-user cohorts and matched case-control designs, results were similar, with slightly less elevated risk estimates. Assuming that the observed associations are causal, approximately one third of new cases of diabetes may be attributed to use of olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine in patients taking these medications.

The synergistic effect of attaching a PBD unit to a polypyrrole fragment is illustrated by the large increase in DNA binding affinity (up to 50-fold) compared to the individual PBD and pyrrole components. 50a-f were found to bind mainly to identical DNA sequences but with apparent binding site widths increasing with molecular length and the majority of sites conforming to the consensus motif 5'-XGXWz (z = 3 +/- 1; W = A or T; X = any base but preferably a purine). They also provided robust sequence-selective blockade of transcription at sites corresponding approximately to their DNA footprints. 50a-f were shown to have good cellular/nuclear penetration properties, and a degree of correlation between cytotoxicity and DNA-binding affinity was observed.", 
    "209": "Case-control studies are often used to examine putative teratogenic drug effects during organogenesis but these studies are subject to confounding by indication, recall, and participation bias. The case-time-control approach is less susceptible to these sources of bias. We studied congenital abnormalities following exposure to phenytoin, phenobarbital, and diazepam in early pregnancy, i.e., second and third month, compared to mid-pregnancy, i.e., fifth and sixth month of pregnancy.", 
    "210": "We analyzed data from the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities (1980-1996) in a case-time-control study.", 
    "211": "The study included 22 843 children with congenital abnormalities (cases) and 38 151 children with no abnormalities (controls). Overall, odds ratio (OR) for congenital abnormalities after exposure to one of the three drugs in early pregnancy was 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-1.4). Among children exposed to phenytoin OR for congenital abnormalities was 3.7 (95%CI: 0.3-49.6), for children exposed to phenobarbital the OR was 1.1 (95%CI 0.7-1.7), and for diazepam, OR for congenital abnormalities was 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0-1.4).", 
    "212": "The associations we found between the drugs examined and congenital abnormalities were either only borderline significant or not statistically significant. The case-time-control study provides an interesting way of using existing case-control data to study rare side effect of drugs taken during pregnancy."
