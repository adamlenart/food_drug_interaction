Much of patient knowledge regarding medicines comes from communications with healthcare professionals. This study, part of the DRUID (Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, alcohol and medicines) project, was carried out in four European countries and attempts to define predictors for knowledge of patients who use driving-impairing medicines. The influence of socio-demographic variables on patient knowledge was investigated as well as the influence of socio-demographic factors, knowledge and attitudes on patients' reported behaviour regarding driving under the influence of medicines.", 
    "1": "Pharmacists handed out questionnaires to patients who met the inclusion criteria: 1) prevalent user of benzodiazepines, antidepressants or first generation antihistamines for systemic use; 2) age between 18 and 75 years old and 3) actual driver of a motorised vehicle. Factors affecting knowledge and reported behaviour towards driving-impairing medicines were analysed by means of multiple linear regression analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis, respectively.", 
    "2": "A total of 633 questionnaires (out of 3.607 that were distributed to patients) were analysed. Patient knowledge regarding driving under the influence of medicines is better in younger and higher educated patients. Information provided to or accessed by patients does not influence knowledge. Patients who experienced side effects and who have a negative attitude towards driving under the influence of impairing medicines are more prone to change their driving frequency behaviour than those who use their motorised vehicles on a daily basis or those who use anti-allergic medicines.", 
    "3": "Changes in driving behaviour can be predicted by negative attitudes towards driving under the influence of medicines but not by patients' knowledge regarding driving under the influence of medicines. Future research should not only focus on information campaigns for patients but also for healthcare providers as this might contribute to improve communications with patients regarding the risks of driving under the influence of medicines.", 
    "4": "Consciousness can be manipulated in many ways. Here, we seek to understand whether two such ways, visual masking and pharmacological intervention, share a common pathway in manipulating visual consciousness. We recorded EEG from human participants who performed a backward-masking task in which they had to detect a masked figure form its background (masking strength was varied across trials). In a within-subject design, participants received dextromethorphan (a N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist), lorazepam (LZP; a GABA(A) receptor agonist), scopolamine (a muscarine receptor antagonist), or placebo. The behavioral results show that detection rate decreased with increasing masking strength and that of all the drugs, only LZP induced a further decrease in detection rate. Figure-related ERP signals showed three neural events of interest: (1) an early posterior occipital and temporal generator (94-121 msec) that was not influenced by any pharmacological manipulation nor by masking, (2) a later bilateral perioccipital generator (156-211 msec) that was reduced by masking as well as LZP (but not by any other drugs), and (3) a late bilateral occipital temporal generator (293-387 msec) that was mainly affected by masking. Crucially, only the intermediate neural event correlated with detection performance. In combination with previous findings, these results suggest that LZP and masking both reduce visual awareness by means of modulating late activity in the visual cortex but leave early activation intact. These findings provide the first evidence for a common mechanism for these two distinct ways of manipulating consciousness.",

Furthermore, while the antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine are considered to frequently cause 'sleepiness' or 'sedation', this has not been objectified yet. Therefore, 30 patients with schizophrenia were included in this randomized, double-blind study. Sleep propensity was assessed before and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine using a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT); in the MSLT, sleep latencies of 5 nap opportunities of 20 min during daytime are averaged. In addition, the number of sleep onsets was recorded. Mean sleep latency in untreated schizophrenic patients was 16.2 \u00b1 0.8 min at baseline. Both antipsychotics induced an increase of sleep propensity as indicated by a shortened sleep latency and more sleep onsets during the treatment period as compared to baseline. These effects were strongest in the morning. Four patients receiving clozapine and 3 patients receiving olanzapine reported subjective sleepiness, in all but one commencing in the first treatment week and persisting until study end. While the mean sleep latency during treatment was significantly shorter in these patients (12.3 \u00b1 0.8 min) than in those without subjective sleepiness (14.9 \u00b1 0.7 min), a short sleep latency was not necessarily associated with subjective sleepiness. In conclusion, mean sleep latency was >36% longer (i.e. sleep propensity was lower) in untreated patients with schizophrenia than in healthy subjects previously consistently reported.

The recirculation model of remimazolam explained the observed high venous, compared with arterial, concentrations at later time points. The 2 models were used to simulate the arterial concentrations required for the pharmacodynamic models of sedation (Bispectral Index and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [MOAA/S]) and gave population mean pharmacodynamic parameters as follows: Bispectral Index-IC(50): 0.26, 0.07 \u03bcg/mL; \u03b3: 1.6, 8.6; k(e0): 0.14, 0.053 min(-1); I(MAX): 39, 19, and MOAA/S-IC(50): 0.4, 0.08 \u03bcg/mL; \u03b3: 1.4, 3.4; k(e0): 0.25, 0.050 min(-1) for remimazolam and midazolam, respectively.

Simulations based on these models show that remimazolam delivers extremely rapid sedation, with maximal effect being reached within 3 minutes of the start of treatment. This property will enable maintenance doses to be given more accurately than with slower-acting drugs. No covariate effects considered to be clinically relevant were observed, suggesting that dosing by body weight may offer no advantage over fixed doses in terms of consistency of exposure to remimazolam within the weight range studied (65-90 kg).",

Plasma (0.25 mL) and 96-well-based solid-phase extraction were used for sample preparation. Extraction recoveries ranged between 75 and 92% for both analytes. Extracts were chromatographed within 2 min on a Waters BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm UPLC\u00ae column with a fast gradient consisting of formic acid, ammonia, and acetonitrile. Midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were quantified using deuterium- and (13)C-labeled internal standards and positive electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring mode, which yielded lower limits of quantification of 50 fg/mL (154 fmol/L) and 250 fg/mL (733 fmol/L) and a corresponding precision of <20%. The calibrated concentration ranges were linear for midazolam (0.05-250 pg/mL) and 1'-hydroxymidazolam (0.25-125 pg/mL), with correlation coefficients of >0.99. Within-batch and batch-to-batch precision in the calibrated ranges for both analytes were <14% and <12%. No ion suppression was detectable, and plasma matrix effects were minimized to <15% (<25%) for midazolam (1'-hydroxymidazolam). The assay was successfully applied to assess the kinetics of midazolam in two human volunteers after the administration of single oral microgram doses (1-100 \u03bcg).

Approximately 60% to 90% of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy, characterized by sudden loss of muscle tone. Only 15% of patients manifest all of these symptoms together. Narcolepsy can be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder or even epilepsy. An appropriate clinical history, polysomnogram, Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and, at times, cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels are necessary for diagnosis. The treatment of narcolepsy is aimed toward the different symptoms that the patient manifests. Excessive daytime sleepiness is treated with amphetamine-like or non-amphetamine-like stimulants. Cataplexy is treated with sodium oxybate, tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

We examined CDP effects on licking for normally accepted and avoided taste solutions across a range of concentrations. The effect of CDP (10 mg/kg) versus saline on the licking patterns of water-restricted rats for water and 3 concentrations of sucrose, saccharin, NaCl, monosodium glutamate (MSG), citric acid, and quinine (Q-HCl) solutions was evaluated during 1 h tests. CDP increased meal size for all tastants except citric acid. Analysis of licking microstructure revealed 3 dissociable effects of CDP. CDP affected oromotor coordination as indicated by a uniform increase in the modal interlick interval for all stimuli. CDP increased meal size as indicated by shorter pauses during consumption of water, MSG, and weaker saccharin concentrations, and by fewer long interlick intervals (250-2000 ms) for normally avoided tastants. CDP also increased meal size by increasing burst size, burst duration, and the initial rate of licking for most solutions, suggesting increased hedonic taste evaluation. CDP did not affect variables associated with postingestive feedback such as meal duration or number of bursts, and the results also suggest that CDP did not enhance the perceived taste intensity. We hypothesize that the reduction of pause duration is consistent with an increased motivation to sample the stimulus that synergizes with changes in taste-mediated responsiveness to some but not all stimuli to yield increases in the consumption of both normally accepted and avoided taste stimuli.",

The standard emergency treatment comprising of anticholinergic, AChE reactivator and anticonvulsant does not completely protect against soman toxicity. We have evaluated imidazenil, a new anticonvulsant imidazo benzodiazepine with high affinity and intrinsic efficacy at \u03b15-, \u03b12-, and \u03b13- but low intrinsic efficacy at \u03b11-containing GABA(A) receptors and is devoid of cardiorespiratory depression, sedative/hypnoitc and amnestic actions and does not elicit tolerance and dependence liabilities unlike diazepam, for protection against soman toxicity. Guinea pigs implanted with bipotential radiotelemetry probes for recording EEG and ECG were administered with 26 \u03bcg/kg pyridostigmine bromide 30 min prior to 2\u00d7 LD(50) soman exposure and 1 min later treated with a combination of 2mg/kg atropine sulfate and 25mg/kg 2-pralidoxime and various doses of imidazenil. Intramuscular administration of imidazenil, dose-dependently protected against 2\u00d7 LD(50) of soman toxicity up to 1mg/kg. Further increase in the dose of imidazenil to 2.5mg/kg was less effective than 1mg/kg probably due to non-specific actions at sites other than GABA(A) receptors. Compared to vehicle group, 1mg/kg imidazenil treatment showed optimal increase in survival rate, reduction in behavioral manifestations and high power of EEG spectrum as well as neuronal necrosis. These data suggest that imidazenil is an effective anticonvulsant for medical countermeasure against soman-induced toxicity.", 
    "87": "For many patients, chronic pain is often accompanied, and sometimes amplified, by co-morbidities such as anxiety and depression. Although it represents important challenges, the establishment of appropriate preclinical behavioral models contributes to drug development for treating chronic inflammatory pain and associated psychopathologies. In this study, we investigated whether rats experiencing persistent inflammatory pain induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) developed anxiety-like behaviors, and whether clinically used analgesic and anxiolytic drugs were able to reverse CFA-induced anxiety-related phenotypes. These behaviors were evaluated over 28 days in both CFA- and saline-treated groups with a variety of behavioral tests. CFA-induced mechanical allodynia resulted in increased anxiety-like behaviors as evidenced by: (1) a significant decrease in percentage of time spent and number of entries in open arms of the elevated-plus maze (EPM), (2) a decrease in number of central squares visited in the open field (OF), and (3) a reduction in active social interactions in the social interaction test (SI). The number of entries in closed arms in the EPM and the distance traveled in the OF used as indicators of locomotor performance did not differ between treatments. Our results also reveal that in CFA-treated rats, acute administration of morphine (3mg/kg, s.c.) abolished tactile allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors, whereas acute administration of diazepam (1mg/kg, s.c) solely reversed anxiety-like behaviors. Therefore, pharmacological treatment of anxiety-like behaviors induced by chronic inflammatory pain can be objectively evaluated using multiple behavioral tests. Such a model could help identify/validate alternative potential targets that influence pain and cognitive dimensions of anxiety.",

    "106": "Input function noise contributes to model-predicted values and should be accounted for during parameter estimation. This problem has been examined in the context of PET data analysis using a noisy image-derived arterial input function. Huesman and Mazoyer (1987 Phys. Med. Biol 32 1569-79) incorporated the effect of error in the measured input function into the objective function and observed a subsequent improvement in the accuracy of parameters estimated from a kinetic model of cardiac blood flow. Such a treatment has not been applied to the reference region models commonly used to analyze dynamic positron emission tomography data with receptor-ligand tracers. Here, we propose a strategy for selection of weighting factors that accounts for noise in the reference region input function and test the method on two common formulations of the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). We present a simulation study which demonstrates that the proposed weighting approach improves the accuracy of estimated binding potential at high noise levels and when the reference tissue and target regions of interest are of comparable size. In the second simulation experiment, we show that using a small, homogeneous reference tissue with our weighting technique may have advantages over input functions derived from a larger (and thus less noisy), heterogeneous region with conventional weighting. A comparative analysis of clinical [(11)C]flumazenil data found a small but significant increase in estimated binding potential when using the proposed weighting method, consistent with the finding of reduced negative bias in our simulation study. The weighting strategy described here accounts for noise in the reference region input function and may improve the performance of the SRTM in applications where data are noisy and the reference region is relatively small. This technique may offer similar benefits to other models using reference region inputs, particularly those derived from the SRTM.",

For patients with severe burns, providers may advocate to withdraw life support early during hospitalization when the extent of injury makes survival highly unlikely or when the patient's condition deteriorates during resuscitation. Our regional burn center has implemented a stepwise withdrawal protocol since 2001 in an effort to standardize symptoms palliation at the end of life. In this study, the authors evaluated the frequency of early withdrawal and the protocol impact on end-of-life processes of care in burn patients who died within 72 hours of hospitalization. A 13-year review of all burn patients aged \u226518 years admitted to our burn center to identify all patients who died within 72 hours of hospitalization was performed. Patients were dichotomized to the periods before (1995 to mid-2001) and after implementation of standardized withdrawal protocol (mid-2001 to 2007). Descriptive analyses were performed to compare end-of-life care processes between the two periods. A total of 4374 adult patients with acute burns were admitted during the 13-year study period, of which 252 (6%) died during hospitalization. Of the patients who died within 72 hours, 106 (84%) had withdrawal of life support compared with 20 (16%) who died with ongoing life support. Higher mean TBSA distinguished patients who died by withdrawal (61 vs 48%, P = .06). Since mid-2001, all 61 patients who had life support withdrawn were by protocol. Implementation of the protocol has led to more frequent use of opioid infusion (98 vs 87%, P = .07) and benzodiazepine infusion (95 vs 49%, P < .01), without hastening time to death (median 5.0 vs 5.5 hours, P = .70). The large majority of early burn deaths at our regional center occur via withdrawal of life support. Implementation of a protocolized withdrawal has resulted in more consistent provision of analgesia and sedation without hastening death.

    "133": "Management of refractory status epilepticus (SE) involves administration of intravenous \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor agonists, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or propofol. Animal models suggest that reductions in synaptic GABA(A) receptors may cause these drugs to become less effective as the duration of SE increases. This may explain the large doses that are commonly required to control seizures, which in turn contributes to a high incidence of complications, including hypotension and the need for vasopressors. In contrast, expression of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors increases with prolonged SE and their stimulation by glutamate may propagate seizure activity. Ketamine is a NMDA-receptor antagonist that is considered promising as treatment for refractory SE. Compared with other anaesthetic drugs, ketamine produces less hypotension.",

The dose was rapidly titrated upwards using quantitative continuous EEG monitoring, until seizures were completely abolished. SE did not recur with weaning of sedatives and he went on to have an excellent recovery. A small number of previous reports have found ketamine to abort late SE. In most cases, ketamine was administered several days into the course, and outcomes were poor even though seizures were controlled.",

The current medication is rather unspecific and, despite considerable efforts, its efficacy is still unsatisfactory. However, there are no appropriate and specific animal models available to study the underlying etiology of the disorder. Therefore, we aimed to establish a model of specific social fear in mice and use this social fear conditioning (SFC) model to assess the therapeutic efficacy of the benzodiazepine diazepam and of the antidepressant paroxetine; treatments currently used for SAD patients. We show that by administering electric foot shocks (2-5, 1\u2009s, 0.7\u2009mA) during the investigation of a con-specific, the investigation of unfamiliar con-specifics was reduced for both the short- and long-term, indicating lasting social fear. The induced fear was specific to social stimuli and did not lead to other behavioral alterations, such as fear of novelty, general anxiety, depression, and impaired locomotion. We show that social fear was dose-dependently reversed by acute diazepam, at doses that were not anxiolytic in a non-social context, such as the elevated plus maze. Finally, we show that chronic paroxetine treatment reversed social fear. All in all, we demonstrated robust social fear after exposure to SFC in mice, which was reversed with both acute benzodiazepine and chronic antidepressant treatment. We propose the SFC model as an appropriate animal model to identify the underlying etiology of SAD and possible novel treatment approaches.",

The subjects were randomized to a total daily dose of 500 mg metyrapone/20 mg oxazepam (low dose), a total daily dose of 1500 mg metyrapone/20 mg oxazepam (high dose), or placebo for 6 weeks of treatment. The outcome measures were a reduction in cocaine craving and associated cocaine use as determined by quantitative measurements of the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE) in urine at all visits. Of the randomized subjects, 49% completed the study. The combination of metyrapone and oxazepam was well tolerated and tended to reduce cocaine craving and cocaine use, with significant reductions at several time points when controlling for baseline scores.

Two hundred and five agitation-exhibiting schizophrenic inpatients at six hospitals were originally included in the study. The 47-day trial consisted of 5 days (session I) of receiving either oral treatment (RIS-OS plus clonazepam) or intramuscular treatment (intramuscular haloperidol) and a 42-day (session II) period of either withdrawing from clonazepam or shifting from intramuscular haloperidol to a RIS-OS period. The primary efficacy outcome was measured as the change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) in session I and the change in the PANSS in session II. Safety was assessed by the frequency of the adverse events. Mean PANSS-EC improvement was significant after 5 days of treatment in both groups (P>0.05) and was similar between the two treatment groups (P<0.01). Most patients' PANSS-EC scores improved or remained stable during the drawback/shift treatment period. Efficacy was not significantly different between the two treatment groups after the 6-week treatment (P>0.05). However, combination treatment exhibited greater efficacy, and adverse events, especially extrapyramidal symptoms, were lower with the oral treatment than with the intramuscular treatment in session I. These results show that RIS-OS in combination with clonazepam is an effective treatment, comparable with intramuscular haloperidol, and is well-tolerated for acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia.",

Seventeen CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitors were incubated with hepatocytes in human plasma or hepatocyte maintenance medium (HMM) for 20 min over a range of concentrations after which midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation or (R)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation were used to quantify the corresponding cytochrome P450 (P450) catalytic activities. Two methods were used to predict the human exposure ratio of the victim drug in the presence and absence of inhibitor. The HMM K(i, app) values were combined with the free average systemic plasma concentration (\"free [I] with HMM K(i, app)\") and the plasma K(i, app) values were combined with the total average systemic plasma concentration (\"total [I] with plasma K(i, app)\"). Of 63 clinical DDI studies, the total [I] with plasma K(i, app) method predicted 89% of cases within 2-fold of the reported interaction whereas the free [I] with HMM K(i, app) method predicted only 59%. There was a general underprediction by the free [I] with HMM K(i, app) method, which is consistent with an underestimation of in vitro inhibition potency in this system.

Here we show the feasibility of a novel drug delivery system (DDS), utilizing L-PGDS, for poorly water-soluble compounds such as diazepam (DZP), a major benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, and 6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX), an \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist and anticonvulsant. Calorimetric experiments revealed for both compounds that each L-PGDS held three molecules with high binding affinities. By mass spectrometry, the 1:3 complex of L-PGDS and NBQX was observed. L-PGDS of 500\u03bcM increased the solubility of DZP and NBQX 7- and 2-fold, respectively, compared to PBS alone. To validate the potential of L-PGDS as a drug delivery vehicle in vivo, we have proved the prospective effects of these compounds via two separate delivery strategies. First, the oral administration of a DZP/L-PGDS complex in mice revealed an increased duration of pentobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex. Second, the intravenous treatment of ischemic gerbils with NBQX/L-PGDS complex showed a protective effect on delayed neuronal cell death at the hippocampal CA1 region. We propose that our novel DDS could facilitate pharmaceutical development and clinical usage of various water-insoluble compounds.",

The development of AUDs involves repeated alcohol use leading to tolerance, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and physical and psychological dependence, with loss of ability to control excessive drinking. Currently there is no effective therapeutic agent for AUDs without major side effects. Dihydromyricetin (DHM; 1 mg/kg, i.p. injection), a flavonoid component of herbal medicines, counteracted acute alcohol (EtOH) intoxication, and also withdrawal signs in rats including tolerance, increased anxiety, and seizure susceptibility; DHM greatly reduced EtOH consumption in an intermittent voluntary EtOH intake paradigm in rats. GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are major targets of acute and chronic EtOH actions on the brain. At the cellular levels, DHM (1 \u03bcM) antagonized both acute EtOH-induced potentiation of GABA(A)Rs and EtOH exposure/withdrawal-induced GABA(A)R plasticity, including alterations in responsiveness of extrasynaptic and postsynaptic GABA(A)Rs to acute EtOH and, most importantly, increases in GABA(A)R \u03b14 subunit expression in hippocampus and cultured neurons. DHM anti-alcohol effects on both behavior and CNS neurons were antagonized by flumazenil (10 mg/kg in vivo; 10 \u03bcM in vitro), the benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist. DHM competitively inhibited BZ-site [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding (IC(50), 4.36 \u03bcM), suggesting DHM interaction with EtOH involves the BZ sites on GABA(A)Rs. In summary, we determined DHM anti-alcoholic effects on animal models and determined a major molecular target and cellular mechanism of DHM for counteracting alcohol intoxication and dependence. We demonstrated pharmacological properties of DHM consistent with those expected to underlie successful medical treatment of AUDs; therefore DHM is a therapeutic candidate.",

For pLGICs, it is postulated that neurotransmitter-induced movements in the extracellular inner \u03b2-sheet trigger channel activation. Homology modeling reveals that the \u03b24-\u03b25 linker physically connects the neurotransmitter binding site to the inner \u03b2-sheet. Inserting 1, 2, 4, and 8 glycines in this region of the GABA(A) receptor \u03b2-subunit progressively decreases GABA activation and converts the competitive antagonist SR-95531 into a partial agonist, demonstrating that this linker is a key element whose length and flexibility are optimized for efficient signal propagation. Insertions in the \u03b1- and \u03b3-subunits have little effect on GABA or SR-95531 actions, suggesting that asymmetric motions in the extracellular domain power pLGIC gating. The effects of insertions on allosteric modulator actions, pentobarbital, and benzodiazepines, have different subunit dependences, indicating that modulator-induced signaling is distinct from agonist gating.",

The impact of zolpidem, a GABAR\u03b11-selective agonist, on [(11)C]Ro15-4513, which shows selectivity for GABAR\u03b15, and the nonselective benzodiazepine ligand [(11)C]flumazenil binding was assessed in humans. Compartmental modelling of the kinetics of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 time-activity curves was used to describe distribution volume (V(T)) differences in regions populated by different GABA receptor subtypes. Those with low \u03b15 were best fitted by one-tissue compartment models; and those with high \u03b15 required a more complex model. The heterogeneity between brain regions suggested spectral analysis as a more appropriate method to quantify binding as it does not a priori specify compartments. Spectral analysis revealed that zolpidem caused a significant V(T) decrease (~10%) in [(11)C]flumazenil, but no decrease in [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding. Further analysis of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 kinetics revealed additional frequency components present in regions containing both \u03b11 and \u03b15 subtypes compared with those containing only \u03b11. Zolpidem reduced one component (mean\u00b1s.d.: 71%\u00b141%), presumed to reflect \u03b11-subtype binding, but not another (13%\u00b122%), presumed to reflect \u03b15.

Benzodiazepines are effective and reduce anxiety in the hours after use, but the induced sleep tends to be less than ideal in quality, with increased Stages I-II and reduces Stages III-IV sleep. In the present study, we investigated sleep disturbance under a neuropathic pain-like state in mice using electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG). In a model of neuropathic pain, sciatic nerve ligation caused a marked decrease in the latency of paw withdrawal in response to a thermal stimulus only on the ipsilateral side. Under this condition, sciatic nerve-ligated animals showed a statistically significant increase in wakefulness and a decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the light phase. Mirtazapine (MTZ) is an antidepressant, which is considered to enhance noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission via antagonistic action at central \u03b12-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors. In the present binding study, MTZ showed higher affinity for histamine H\u2081 and serotonin 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors than other receptors, including \u03b12-adrenergic receptor, in the mouse brain tissue. The thermal hyperalgesia and sleep disturbance following nerve ligation were almost completely alleviated by MTZ. These findings suggest that MTZ may improve the quality of sleep as well as control pain in patients with neuropathic pain mainly through histamine H\u2081- and serotonin 5-HT\u2082-receptor antagonistic actions.",

The second-generation antipsychotics, with their proven efficacy against manic symptoms, are emerging as candidates for use against the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Several studies have shown that some second-generation antipsychotics may improve depressive symptoms in mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. More recently, specific studies have been performed in patients with bipolar depressive episodes. Quetiapine or olanzapine, as monotherapy or associated with other compounds, demonstrate an interesting efficacy. The international guidelines for the treatment of bipolar depression have identified quetiapine as a first line treatment in monotherapy.

Our current knowledge of this disease encompasses frequent secondary cytogenetic aberrations and the recurrent mutation of a handful of genes, such as TP53, ATM, and CCND1. However, these findings insufficiently explain the biologic underpinnings of MCL. Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 18 primary tissue MCL samples and 2 cell lines.

In total, 12% of clinical samples and 20% of cell lines harbored somatic NOTCH1 coding sequence mutations that clustered in the PEST domain and predominantly consisted of truncating mutations or small frame-shifting indels. NOTCH1 mutations were associated with poor overall survival (P = .003). Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of the NOTCH pathway reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in 2 MCL cell lines.

Different brain areas and neuronal populations most likely mediate these different behavioral effects. We used c-Fos immunohistochemistry as an indirect way to study neuronal activation or inhibition induced by DZ at anxiolytic and sedative doses (0.5 and 5mg/kg, respectively) in various brain areas involved in anxiety, arousal, sedation and addiction in C57BL/6J mice. We also focused on the two neuronal populations, orexinergic and dopaminergic neuronal populations, with the help of double-immunohistochemistry using c-Fos and orexin-A antibodies and c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies. We found that different brain areas of unhabituated mice reacted differently to the mild stress induced by vehicle injection. Also the response to anxiolytic or sedative doses of DZ differed between the areas, suggesting that distinct brain areas mediate the behavioral effects of low and high DZ doses. Our findings propose a role for inhibition of orexin neurons in the anxiolytic and sleep-promoting effects of DZ. In addition, the activation of central amygdala neurons by DZ treatment was associated with anxiolytic and sedative effects. On the other hand, the ventral hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, ventral tegmental area and prefrontal cortex were sensitive even to the mild injection stress, but not to the anxiolytic dose of DZ.", 
    "240": "The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), mediates the transportation of cholesterol and anions from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane in different cells types. Although recent evidences indicate a potential role for TSPO in the development of inflammatory processes, the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. The present study investigated the ability of the specific TSPO ligands, the isoquinoline carboxamide PK11195 and benzodiazepine Ro5-4864, on neutrophil recruitment promoted by the N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine peptide (fMLP), an agonist of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Pre-treatment with Ro5-4864 abrograted fMLP-induced leukocyte-endothelial interactions in mesenteric postcapillary venules in vivo. Moreover, in vitro Ro5-4864 treatment prevented fMLP-induced: (i) L-selectin shedding and overexpression of PECAM-1 on the neutrophil cell surface; (ii) neutrophil chemotaxis and (iii) enhancement of intracellular calcium cations (iCa(+2)). Intriguingly, the two latter effects were augmented by cell treatment with PK11195. An allosteric agonist/antagonist relation may be suggested, as the effects of Ro5-4864 on fMLP-stimulated neutrophils were reverted by simultaneous treatment with PK11195. Taken together, these data highlight TSPO as a modulator of pathways of neutrophil adhesion and locomotion induced by GPCR, connecting TSPO actions and the onset of an innate inflammatory response.", 
    "241": "A series of benzo[c,d]indol-2(1H)one-PBD conjugates (11a-l) have been designed and synthesized as potential anticancer agents. These compounds were prepared by linking the C8-position of DC-81 with a benzo[c,d]indol-2(1H)one moiety through different alkane spacers in good yields and confirmed by (1)H NMR, mass and HRMS data. The DNA binding ability of these conjugates was evaluated by thermal denaturation studies and interestingly, compound 11l showed enhanced DNA binding ability. These compounds were also evaluated for their anticancer activity in selected human cancer cell lines of lung, skin, colon and prostate by using MTT assay method. These new conjugates showed promising anticancer activity with IC(50) values ranging from 1.05 to 36.49 \u03bcM. Moreover, cell cycle arrest in SubG1 phase was observed upon treatment of A549 cells with 1 and 2 \u03bcM (IC(50)) concentrations of compound 11l and it induced apoptosis. This is confirmed by Annexin V-FITC, Hoechst staining, caspase-3 activity as well as DNA fragmentation analysis.", 
    "242": "A new polymorph \u03b1 of indiplon was discovered, initially prepared by two methods, and further characterized by various means including single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) spectroscopy and solubility determination. The crystal structure of Form \u03b1 as analyzed by SCXRD differ from the three previously reported polymorphs, Form I, II, and III. In addition, PXRD and solubility measurements could clearly distinguish between Form \u03b1 and Form I. Slight differences between the two forms were also detected by FT-Raman. No differences between Form \u03b1 and I were observed by DSC, which was explained by VT-PXRD results showing a solid-solid phase change from Form \u03b1 to Form I during the heating process. Solubility measurements at various temperatures showed that the two polymorphs were mutually monotropic and that Form I was the relatively thermodynamically stable crystal form.", 
    "243": "Inappropriate prescriptions are common in older people admitted to nursing homes. Commonly used instruments to detect potential inappropriate prescriptions have limitations that have precluded wide use, and new instruments are needed.", 
    "244": "The goal of this study was to determine the value of the Screening Tool of Older Person's potentially inappropriate Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert doctors to the Right, ie appropriate, indicated Treatment (STOPP-START) criteria and the Australian criteria to detect potentially inappropriate drug prescriptions in older people on admission to nursing home care.", 
    "245": "Cross-sectional study of 100 consecutive patients (mean age 84.7 \u00b1 7.5 years, 80% women) admitted to 6 assisted living nursing homes, with systematic review of prescriptions used at the time of nursing home admission using the STOPP-START and the Australian criteria looking for potentially inappropriate drug treatments.", 
    "246": "Using the STOPP criteria, 79% of the subjects showed at least one potentially inappropriate prescription. Omissions of potentially appropriate drugs were found by the START criteria in 74% of them. The Australian criteria detected at least one potential problem in 95% of the sample. The number of subjects with 2 or more problems detected was highest using the Australian criteria (72%). The most frequent potentially inappropriately used drugs detected were proton-pump inhibitors, benzodiazepines, antipsychotic drugs, and anticholinergic drugs; many cases of duplicate medications and drug interactions were also detected. Underuse of statins and aspirin in patients with high cardiovascular risk, and of calcium and vitamin D in osteoporosis was also frequent.", 
    "247": "A high number of potentially inappropriate drug prescriptions can be detected at the time of admission to nursing home care by the use of systematic instruments. Both STOPP-START criteria and the Australian criteria performed well in this setting. The impact of this detection on health outcomes and costs should be assessed before they can be widely recommended.", 
    "248": "Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (LDW), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used for the treatment of various diseases in China. This study was designed to investigate the potential herb-drug interactions of LDW in healthy volunteers and attempted to ascertain whether the interaction might be affected by genotypes. We assessed the effect of LDW on the activities of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in 12 Chinese healthy subjects in a single-center, controlled, non-blinded, two-way crossover clinical trial. The subject pool consisted of six extensive metabolizers with CYP2C19*1/*1 and six poor metabolizers with CYP2C19*2/*2. Placebo or 4.8\u2009g LDW (12 pills, 0.2\u2009g/pill, twice daily) was given to each participant for 14 continuous days with a wash-out period of 2 weeks after an oral administration of 30\u2009mg omeprazole, 30\u2009mg dextromethorphan hydrobromide and 7.5\u2009mg midazolam. The activities of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were ascertained by their respective plasma or urinary metabolic ratios on day 14 post-treatment. There is no difference in the activities of the three tested enzymes before or after a 14-day administration of LDW. LDW had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the substrates and their metabolites. A 14-day administration of LDW did not affect the activities of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. LDW is unlikely to cause pharmacokinetic interaction when it is combined with other medications predominantly metabolized by these enzymes.", 
    "249": "Total and differential leucocyte count (TLC and DLC) in blood circulation influence humoral immune response and stress alters TLC and DLC by leucocyte misdistribution. Chlordiazepoxide, a widely used benzodiazepine anti-stress agent, is reported to reverse suppression of antibody response induced by acute stress but not by chronic stress. The effect of chlordiazepoxide on the changes in leucocyte count by acute and chronic stress has not been clearly defined. We examined the effect of restraint stress (1\u2009h/day) for 6, 10, 14 and 21 days on TLC and DLC and their modulation by chlordiazepoxide pretreatment (10\u2009mg/kg/day) 1\u2009h before exposure to stress in albino rats. Acute stress, i.e. restraint stress (1\u2009h/day) for 6 and 10 days with or with out chlordiazepoxide pretreatment did not alter TLC and DLC. Chronic stress, i.e. restraint stress (1\u2009h/day) for 14 and 21 days significantly decreased TLC and the percentage of lymphocytes in comparison to control. Pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide reversed these changes. We conclude that chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine, reverses changes in TLC and DLC probably by improving chronic stress-induced leucocytes misdistribution.", 
    "250": "Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is a clinical syndrome that is typified by a disturbance of consciousness, attention, cognition and perception. It is estimated that the incidence of delirium varies between 28.3% to 80% in intensive care patients. Delirium is most likely to affect older patients above the age of 65 years.", 
    "251": "The primary focus of this systematic review was to synthesise the best available evidence to identify the factors which are associated with acute delirium in critically ill adult patients.", 
    "252": "A three-step search strategy was utilised in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken. A search strategy was then developed using identified keywords and MeSH headings. Lastly, the reference lists of all identified studies were examined. All searches were limited to English language studies published between 1990 and 2010.", 
    "253": "The participants of this review were adult patients in a critical care setting who present with acute delirium in the intensive care unit.The review considered studies which examine the factors causing delirium in critically ill adult patients, such as fever, hypoxia and sepsis.This review considered studies that included the incidence of acute delirium as related to the individual factors as an outcome measure.This review considered any high quality quantitative papers that addressed factors causing acute delirium in intensive care unit patients. This review included data from cohort and case control studies.", 
    "254": "The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cohort / Case Control Studies was used to assess methodological quality.", 
    "255": "Data were extracted using a standardised Data Extraction Tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the study methods, the findings of this systematic review are presented in a narrative summary.", 
    "256": "Twenty-four papers were included in this review. Some factors were common; however certain factors were exclusive to the type of setting. With regards to pharmacological factors, benzodiazepines were the most likely medications to be associated with delirium as compared to other drugs used in the intensive care unit. With regards to biomarkers, a variety were implicated in causing delirium, such as apolipoprotein 4 genotype, plasma tryptophan, interleukin-6, cortisol and C-reactive protein. Older age was also found to be a common risk factor.", 
    "257": "With regards to the medical and surgical intensive care units, relatively similar risk factors of older age and co-morbidity are significant. In the cardiac intensive care unit, a variety of risk factors were significant. Benzodiazepines have been singled out as the most likely drug to cause delirium. The biomarkers cortisol and hypoalbuminemia were also shown to be significant risk factors of delirium.", 
    "258": "Future research should use increased sample sizes, recruited from more than one hospital, assessing diverse factors. Future studies could examine the effects of specific biomarkers on delirium.", 
    "259": "By creating a regression model for delirium prediction, clinicians may be able to create a checklist to identify patients at risk of developing delirium. This checklist could assist in monitoring patients at higher risk for developing delirium, allowing measures to be implemented for preventing the incidence or reducing the severity of delirium. The use of benzodiazepines should also be avoided if possible, as they are seen to have a significant association with the incidence of delirium.", 
    "260": "Benzodiazepines are the most widely prescribed class of psychoactive drugs in current therapeutic use, despite the important unwanted side effects that they produce, such as sedation, myorelaxation, ataxia, amnesia, and ethanol and barbiturate potentiation and tolerance. They exert their therapeutic effects via binding to the benzodiazepine binding site of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors, and allosterically modulating the chloride flux through the ion channel complex. First isolated from plants used as tranquilizers in folkloric medicine, some natural flavonoids have been shown to possess selective affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site with a broad spectrum of central nervous system effects. Since the initial search for alternative benzodiazepine ligands amongst the flavonoids, a list of successful synthetic derivatives has been generated with enhanced activities. This review provides an update on research developments that have established the activity of natural and synthetic flavonoids on GABA type A receptors. Flavonoids are prominent drugs in the treatment of mental disorders, and can also be used as tools to study modulatory sites at GABA type A receptors and to develop GABA type A selective agents further.", 
    "261": "Benzodiazepines have a various behavioral effects in addition to their anxiolytic action. There is every reason to believe that the BZ/GABA receptor complex is involved in these effects, since GABAmimetic manipulations modify the effect of BZ in tests of convulsive activity, motor function, and appetitive behavior. 1,5-Benzodiazepines are biologically important molecules and are extensively used clinically as analgesic, hypnotic, sedative, and antidepressive agents. Hence, 1,5-Benzodiazepines were synthesized by condensation of o-phenylenediamine and ketones, for example, cyclohexanone and acetone in presence of sulfated zirconia (catalyst). Mannich bases were synthesized with acetophenone, p-nitroacetophenone, p-chloroacetophenone, and formaldehyde. Schiff bases were synthesized using Mannich base of 1,5-benzodiazepines with p-chloroaniline and p-chlorophenylsemicarbazide in the presence of glacial acetic acid. All the synthesized compounds were characterized by (1)H NMR and IR spectral analyses. All the synthesized derivatives were evaluated at the dose of 30\u2009mg/kg b.w for anticonvulsant activity by isoniazid induced convulsion model, and the compounds NBZD-3 and NBZD-8 were found to be the most active among all compounds. Among all the synthesized derivatives, compounds NBZD-13 and NBZD-17 were found to be the most active among all compounds using thiosemicarbazide induced model. Although NBZD-8, NBZD-10, and NBZD-18 are the compounds which had shown good anticonvulsant activity and have an advantage over that, they were not sedative."
