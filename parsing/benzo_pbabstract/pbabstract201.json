    "0": "Recent emerging biochemical data indicate that several important neuroregulatory genes and proteins may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Additionally, the same genes appear to be targets of several psychotropic medications that are used to treat these disorders. Recent DNA microarray studies show that genes involved in synaptic neurotransmission, signal transduction, and glutamate/GABA regulation may be differentially regulated in brains of subjects with schizophrenia. We hypothesized that chronic administration of olanzapine to rats would alter expression of various genes that may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and mood disorders. Rats were administered olanzapine (N=20, 2 mg/kg/day) or sterile saline intraperitoneally (N=20) daily for 21 days. Control and olanzapine-treated frontal cortices were analyzed using cDNA microarray technology. The results showed significant downregulation of 31 genes and upregulation of 38 genes by greater than two-fold in the drug-treated brains vs controls. Our results provide evidence for altered regulation of genes involved with signal transduction and cell communication, metabolism and energy pathways, transport, immune response, nucleic acid metabolism, and neuronal growth factors. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis verified the direction and magnitude of change in six genes of interest: calbindin 3, homer 1, regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 2, pyruvate kinase, Reelin and insulin 2. Western blotting showed significant upregulation in protein products for Reelin 410 and Reelin 180 kDa and downregulation for NMDA3B and RGS2. Our results show for the first time that olanzapine causes changes in levels of several important genes that may be involved in the etiology and treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.", 
    "1": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of established risk factors for treatment-emergent diabetes (TED) among patients over 65 years of age with dementia who received treatment with olanzapine.", 
    "2": "This was a post hoc analysis of data pooled from seven olanzapine clinical trials, which included patients over 65 years of age with dementia. The association of established risk factors for TED was evaluated using categorical and time-to-event analysis. TED was defined as two casual (fasting or nonfasting) glucose values > or =200 mg/dL at any time after baseline or one casual glucose value > or =200 mg/dL at the final visit, initiation of antidiabetic medication, or new clinical diagnosis of diabetes.", 
    "3": "Elderly patients subsequently identified with TED (N = 29, 2.1%) had similar baseline body mass indices (24 kg/m(2)) and were similar in age (82 versus 80 years) to those who did not have TED. Cox proportional hazards model identified only elevated casual glucose (> or =140 mg/dL) measure at baseline to be significantly associated with the development of TED (hazard ratio [HR] = 11.2, p <0.0001) in this elderly cohort. Other clinical risk factors, like body mass index > or =25 (HR = 0.86), 7% weight gain (HR = 2.26), and antipsychotic treatment (HR = 1.36) were not significant.", 
    "4": "In elderly patients with dementia enrolled in olanzapine clinical trials, an elevated casual glucose (> or =140 mg/dL) at baseline was the only risk factor significantly associated with subsequent development of TED. Risk of diabetes in these studies was not significantly associated with antipsychotic treatment group assignment.", 
    "5": "In the adult rat hippocampus, granule cell mossy fibers (MFs) form excitatory glutamatergic synapses with CA3 principal cells and local inhibitory interneurons. However, evidence has been provided that, in young animals and after seizures, the same fibers can release in addition to glutamate GABA. Here we show that, during the first postnatal week, stimulation of granule cells in the dentate gyrus gave rise to monosynaptic GABAA-mediated responses in principal cells and in interneurons. These synapses were indeed made by MFs because they exhibited strong paired-pulse facilitation, high sensitivity to the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist l-AP-4, and short-term frequency-dependent facilitation. MF responses were potentiated by blocking the plasma membrane GABA transporter GAT-1 with NO-711 or by allosterically modulating GABAA receptors with flurazepam. Chemical stimulation of granule cell dendrites with glutamate induced barrages of GABAA-mediated postsynaptic currents into target neurons. Furthermore, immunocytochemical experiments demonstrated colocalization of vesicular GABA transporter with vesicular glutamate transporter-1 and zinc transporter 3, suggesting that GABA can be taken up and stored in synaptic vesicles of MF terminals. Additional fibers releasing both glutamate and GABA into principal cells and interneurons were recruited by increasing the strength of stimulation. Both the GABAergic and the glutamatergic component of synaptic currents occurred with the same latency and were reversibly abolished by l-AP-4, indicating that they originated from the MFs. GABAergic signaling may play a crucial role in tuning hippocampal network during postnatal development. Low-threshold GABA-releasing fibers may undergo elimination, and this may occur when GABA shifts from the depolarizing to the hyperpolarizing direction.",

    "7": "The study aim is to evaluate benzodiazepine use and risk for breast cancer in Ontario, Canada, by using a population-based case-control study design.", 
    "8": "Cases were a random sample of women aged 25 to 74 years identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry and diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 1998 (n = 3133). Controls were an age-matched random sample of women (n = 3062). Cases and controls completed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions about their past use of benzodiazepines (defined as daily use for at least 2 months) and potential confounders. Individual classes of benzodiazepines also were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.", 
    "9": "Compared with nonusers, ever use of benzodiazepines was not significantly associated with risk for breast cancer (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.88-1.27). No apparent trends were observed for duration of use, time since first use, or time since last use. Estimates according to individual classes of benzodiazepines, including diazepam, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide, also were not statistically significant.", 
    "10": "Our data show no association between benzodiazepine use and breast cancer risk. Results confirm findings from previous studies that diazepam use does not increase the risk for breast cancer and also suggest no association with the use of other benzodiazepine compounds.", 
    "11": "The current study was aimed to characterize for the first time the alterations in the characteristic neuro-inflammatory markers triggered by sarin exposure in the rat's brain, and to investigate its dependency on seizure duration. Centrally mediated seizures are a common consequence of exposure to organophosphates (OP) despite conventional treatment with atropine and an oxime. In the present study midazolam, was used to control duration and intensity of seizures. The levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine peptides IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were monitored at various times after sarin exposure in the hippocampus and cortex of rats treated with midazolam following 5 or 30 min of seizure activity. Biochemical evaluation of brain tissues revealed a significant increase in the level of the pro-inflammatory peptides starting at 2 h and peaking at 2-24 h following sarin. Hippocampal values of IL1-beta increased from 1.2+/-0.1 pg/mg tissue (control), to 2.4+/-0.3 at 2 h (5 min seizure) and to 9.3+/-2.5 at 8h (30 min seizure). PGE2 level in the hippocampus increased up to 24 h following exposure (from 56+/-3 to 175+/-26 and 277+/-28 pg/mg tissue) following 5 and 30 min of seizure activity respectively. Thus, unlike limitation of seizures to 5 min by midazolam, delayed treatment (30 min) resulted in prolonged seizures and pronounced increase in cytokines and PGE2. In addition, a second increase in inflammatory markers was observed 30 days following sarin exposure only in rats treated following 30 min of seizure activity. Histological evaluation of the rat brain, conducted in this study, revealed lack of damage in the hippocampus and piriform cortex with minor lateral ventricles enlargement in few animals following 5 min of sarin-induced seizure activity. In contrast, marked histological damage to the brain was demonstrated following 30 min of seizure activity, consisting severe damage to the hippocampus, piriform cortex and some thalamic nuclei. In summary, a novel characterization of the prolonged central neuro-inflammatory process that accompanies sarin exposure is presented. The timing of the anticonvulsive treatment was shown to be crucial in modulation of the neuro-inflammatory response, and may implicate the consequent long-term brain damage.", 
    "12": "The present study examines the effect of chronic treatment with two atypical neuroleptics, commonly used to treat schizophrenia. Adult rats were given either risperidone or olanzapine in their drinking water for 21 days. Memory was assessed on the first and last day of treatment using an object discrimination test, and the rate of cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ), dentate gyrus (DG) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was quantified by immuno staining for Ki-67. The results show that both risperidone and olanzapine significantly improved performance in object discrimination after 21 days, and additionally, olanzapine significantly increased cell proliferation in the SVZ and PFC but not the DG.", 
    "13": "The mechanism underlying somatodendritic release of dopamine (DA) appears to differ from that of axon-terminal release. Specifically, somatodendritic DA release in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) persists in low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations that are insufficient to support axonal release in striatum, suggesting that limited Ca2+ entry is necessary to trigger somatodendritic release. Here, we compared the role of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in mediating DA release in striatum versus SNc using specific blockers of N-, P/Q-, T-, R- and L-type Ca2+ channels individually and in combination. Release of DA evoked by a single stimulus pulse in the dorsal striatum and SNc of guinea-pig brain slices was monitored in real time using carbon-fiber microelectrodes with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Single-pulse evoked DA release was shown to be independent of regulation by concurrently released glutamate or GABA acting at ionotropic receptors in both regions. Under these conditions, striatal DA release was completely prevented by an N-type channel blocker, omega-conotoxin GVIA (100 nm), and was decreased by 75% by the P/Q-type channel blocker omega-agatoxin IVA (200 nm). Blockade of T-type channels with Ni2+ (100 microm) or R-type channels with SNX-482 (100 nm) decreased axonal release in striatum by 25%, whereas inhibition of L-type channels with nifedipine (20 microm) had no effect. By contrast, none of these Ca2+-channel blockers altered the amplitude of somatodendritic DA release in the SNc. Even a cocktail of all blockers tested did not alter release-signal amplitude in the SNc, although the duration of the release response was curtailed. The limited involvement of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in somatodendritic DA release provides further evidence that minimal Ca2+ entry is required to trigger the release process, compared with that required for axon-terminal release.", 
    "14": "The effects of jointly administered olanzapine and verapamil on the level of neurotransmitters and their metabolites in Wistar rat brain structures have been studied. Verapamil (i) produces a statistically significant decrease in dopamine and serotonin turnover increased by olanzapine injections and (ii) increases the norepinephrine content in all the brain structures studied.", 
    "15": "The prevalence of overdose deaths from opioids is still generally increasing throughout the world. Heroin is still the predominant illicit opioid of interest to toxicology laboratories because of its continuing widespread availability and its ability to elicit respiratory depression and coma. In many countries methadone continues to play a major role in cases of drug toxicity because of its large-scale use to treat opioid dependency and its high potency and long duration of action. Increasingly, buprenorphine is being used as an alternative pharmacotherapy, and although apparently safer than methadone, it still has an inherent risk of toxicity when used with CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines or when injected. Morphine continues to be the dominant analgesic; however, oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl are increasingly being used and will require increasing efforts by toxicology laboratories to ensure that these substances are adequately covered by testing programs.", 
    "16": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common, chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by a persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment can occur. This disorder typically appears during the mid-adolescent years and is unremitting throughout life if not properly treated. SAD presents as two subtypes: the more common and debilitating generalized form, and the nongeneralized form, which consists predominantly of performance anxiety. The majority of patients with SAD have comorbid mental disorders, including mood, anxiety, and substance abuse. No single development theory has been proposed to account for the origins of SAD, although current understanding of the etiology of SAD posits an interaction between psychological and biological factors. Risk factors include environmental and parenting influences and dysfunctional cognitive and conditioning events in early childhood. The neurobiology of SAD appears to involve neurochemical dysfunction, as evidenced by studies of neuroreceptor imaging, neuroendocrine function, and profiles of response to specific medications. Clinical trials have demonstrated that benzodiazepines and antidepressants are effective in the treatment of SAD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are emerging as the first-line treatment for SAD, based on their proven safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Goals for ongoing future research include development of approaches to achieve remission, to convert nonresponders and partial responders to full responders, and to prevent relapse and maintain long-term efficacy. This monograph explores the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and differential diagnosis of SAD, with a focus on neural circuitry of social relationships and neurochemical dysfunction. The prevalence, rates of recognition and treatment, patterns of comorbidity, quality-of-life issues, and natural history of SAD are discussed as well as pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment strategies for SAD.", 
    "17": "Investigation of chemically synthesized inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] analogs has led to the isolation of a novel binding protein with a molecular size of 130 kDa, characterized as a molecule with similar domain organization to phospholipase C-d1 (PLC-d1) but lacking the enzymatic activity. An isoform of the molecule was subsequently identified, and these molecules have been named PRIP (PLC-related, but catalytically inactive protein), with the two isoforms named PRIP-1 and -2. Regarding its ability to bind Ins(1,4,5)P3 via the pleckstrin homology domain, the involvement of PRIP-1 in Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ signaling was examined using COS-1 cells overexpressing PRIP-1 and cultured neurons prepared from PRIP-1 knock-out mice. Yeast two hybrid screening of a brain cDNA library using a unique N-terminus as bait identified GABARAP (GABAA receptor associated protein) and PP1 (protein phosphatase 1), which led us to examine the possible involvement of PRIP in GABAA receptor signaling. For this purpose PRIP knock-out mice were analyzed for GABAA receptor function in relation to the action of benzodiazepines from the electrophysiological and behavioral aspects. During the course of these experiments we found that PRIP also binds to the b-subunit of GABAA receptors and PP2A (protein phosphtase 2A). Here, we summarize how PRIP is involved in Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ signaling and GABAA receptor signaling based on the characteristics of binding molecules.", 
    "18": "Agitation, restlessness, and aggression are frequent neurobehavioural sequelae in the early stages of recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI). These behavioural symptoms disrupt patient care and impede rehabilitation efforts. We review the current literature (1985 onwards) examining the pharmacological management of post-TBI agitation in both acute and post-acute conditions. This article will assess the evidence for the use of selected alkylphenols, benzodiazepines, estrogens, antiandrogens, neuroleptics/antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-Parkinsonian agents, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, buspirone, beta-blockers, and psychostimulants in agitated TBI survivors. Review of the literature suggests that there is limited evidence to accurately guide clinicians in the management of this patient population.", 
    "19": "The influence of sedation on the effect of an H-1 receptor antagonist on various cognitive functions, including memory, were evaluated. Diphenhydramine (50, 75 and 100 mg) and lorazepam (0.5 and 1.5 mg) were given on single occasions to 12 healthy volunteers (six males, six females) aged 20-33 (mean 23.4) years. Subjective assessments of sedation, sleep latencies, digit symbol substitution, choice reaction time, sustained attention and memory recall were studied 1.0 h before and 0.5, 2.0 and 3.5 h after drug ingestion. The study was double blind, placebo controlled and with a crossover design. With all doses of diphenhydramine there was subjective sedation, reduced sleep latencies and impairments in performance on the digit symbol substitution, choice reaction time and sustained attention tasks. No effects were observed with 0.5 mg lorazepam. With 1.5 mg lorazepam there was subjective sedation, fewer digit symbol substitutions, slowed choice reaction time, impaired attention and memory, but no effect on sleep latencies. Contrast analysis of data measured at all time points showed that although there was no difference in the effect of diphenhydramine (100 mg) and lorazepam (1.5 mg) on those tasks without a memory component, response times were slower with lorazepam on those tasks with a memory component. However, both 100 mg diphenhydramine and 1.5 mg lorazepam impaired prompted recall measured at 2 h post-ingestion only. It is considered that impaired memory is not necessarily associated with sedation, and that impairment of memory with drugs that lead to sedation may be effected through neuronal systems independent of those that affect arousal.", 
    "20": "The aim of this study was to examine substance initiation sequences in Taiwanese adolescent methamphetamine (MAMP) users. Three hundred adolescent MAMP users were questioned about their use of cigarettes, alcohol, areca quid, benzodiazepine, glue, marijuana, MAMP and heroin. The sequences of substance use before MAMP use were determined in every subject according to their age at substance initiation. The sequences of substance initiation were compared between genders and between early-onset and late-onset MAMP users. The results revealed that the adolescents had used cigarettes, alcohol and areca quid before MAMP, and very few (4%) adolescents had started using MAMP before using other substances. Female MAMP users were more likely to use MAMP as their first substance and were less likely to use areca quid than males. Male early-onset MAMP users were more likely to drink alcohol and chew areca quid before MAMP use than were late-onset users. This study found that the sequences of substance initiation were different between genders and between the early-onset and late-onset MAMP users. There are several findings that are different from those in Western studies on the sequence of substance initiation in the adolescent population.", 
    "21": "It has been suggested that the extract of gingko biloba (EGb) may enhance the efficiency of the classic antipsychotic haloperidol in patients with chronic schizophrenia, especially on positive symptoms, and reduce serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the therapeutic effect of EGb and to examine the effect of it on the levels of antioxidant enzymes in schizophrenic patients on olanzapine treatment. We hypothesized that EGb would have the beneficial effects on schizophrenic symptoms and might cause reductions in antioxidant enzymes. The subjects were randomly assigned to the two groups: olanzapine plus EGb (group I) (n=15) and olanzapine alone (group II) (n=14). The patients were evaluated at baseline and at week 8 with respect to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), serum SOD, catalase (CAT), and glutathion peroxidase (GPX) levels. At baseline, no statistically significant difference regarding the mean total PANSS scores between treatment groups was found. At the evaluation of week 8, a significant difference in mean Scale for the Assessment of Postive Symptoms (SAPS) scores but not in Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores between groups was found. Total patients had statistically significant higher serum SOD, CAT and GPX levels compared to control groups at baseline. At 8 weeks, there were significant differences in the mean decrease in SOD and CAT levels but not in GPX levels between treatment groups. The changes in SOD and CAT levels were correlated with the change in SAPS in group I, but not in the group II. The present study supported the findings of the previous study demonstrating that EGb might enhance the efficiency of antipsychotic in patients with schizophrenia, particularly on positive symptoms of the disorder.", 
    "22": "Risperidone and olanzapine are the 2 most widely prescribed second-generation anti-psychotics. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of risperidone and olanzapine using duration of hospitalization as the primary outcome measure. This outcome was selected as it is an indirect measure of how well patients are responding to the medication and represents a \"real world\" endpoint relevant to practicing hospital psychiatrists.", 
    "23": "The study was done at a large state psychiatric hospital in North Carolina from 2001 to 2003. Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they required treatment with an antipsychotic (e.g., positive symptoms) and were able to provide informed consent. Eighty-five patients entered the study and were randomly assigned to risperidone (N = 40) or olanzapine (N = 45) as their initial antipsychotic. Treatment was naturalistic, and dosing was based on the discretion of the treating physician.", 
    "24": "There was no significant difference in the mean durations of hospitalization for the risperidone group (7.9 days) as compared to the olanzapine group (8.1 days). There were no significant differences in the demographics of either treatment group, but, during the study, risperidone-treated patients used more antihistamines (chi(2) = 4.0, p = .05). Eighty percent of each group (N = 36, olanzapine; N = 32, risperidone) remained on the study medication at discharge.", 
    "25": "Risperidone and olanzapine were equally efficacious, suggesting that measures other than \"efficacy\" (e.g., side effects, cost) should be considered when determining overall \"effectiveness\" of treatment.", 
    "26": "The aim of this study was to understand the practice of prescription, dispensation and prolonged use of benzodiazepines, from the point of view of health care professionals and of chronic users of these substances. The sample group was formed using the snowball technique, totaling 19 key-informants. The semi-structured interviews were recorded and transcribed for analysis. Most of the interviewees reported frequent benzodiazepine prescriptions through requests made to doctors, without the need for a formal appointment. The users reported a history of prolonged use (between 2 and 8 years) for purposes other than the simple therapeutic purpose. They also emphasized the ease in acquiring the medication and the lack of medical counseling about the necessary precautions during treatment. The study suggests that the occurrence of misuse involves not only the dispensation control system, but also a series of other factors, including the attitudes of health care professionals.", 
    "27": "Although complete seizure control is achievable in 54% to 82% of patients with primary (idiopathic) generalized epilepsy syndromes, there remains a substantial group with inadequate control. Valproate has been considered the drug of choice but is not always effective and might produce unacceptable adverse effects. Several newer drugs have emerged as potential alternatives to valproate, including lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, and zonisamide. Sedation and tolerance limit the utility of benzodiazepines. For severely refractory patients, drug combinations, vagal nerve stimulation, or felbamate might be considered. Only a few controlled clinical trials have been conducted for these syndromes; more are needed.", 
    "28": "Uncontrolled epilepsy is a serious, common, neurological disorder leading to social and psychological problems, as well as increased morbidity and mortality. Neuroimaging studies have the potential to provide information on pathophysiologic mechanisms and underlying etiologies, as well as supporting clinical localization for potential surgical therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning has shown that patients with a history of complex or prolonged febrile seizures are at increased risk for the development of hippocampal injury and mesial temporal sclerosis. Animal models support this finding. In patients with familial partial seizures, mesial temporal sclerosis may be found whether family members have seizures or not, suggesting multifactorial inheritance. Positron emission tomography (PET) with specific neuroreceptor ligands has shown decreased serotonin and benzodiazepine receptor binding, even when structural MRI is normal. These studies have limited clinical value but suggest potential epileptogenic mechanisms. Imaging evaluation in epilepsy should be performed in an orderly sequence, guided by clinical and electroencephalographic data.", 
    "29": "Anxiety, stress, and trauma-related disorders are a major public health concern in the United States. Drugs that target the gamma-aminobutyric acid or serotonergic system, such as benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, respectively, are the most widely prescribed treatments for these disorders. However, the role of glutamate in anxiety disorders is becoming more recognized with the belief that drugs that modulate glutamatergic function through either ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors have the potential to improve the current treatment of these severe and disabling illnesses. Animal models of fear and anxiety have provided a method to study the role of glutamate in anxiety. This research has demonstrated that drugs that alter glutamate transmission have potential anxiolytic action for many different paradigms including fear-potentiated startle, punished responding, and the elevated plus maze. Human clinical drug trials have demonstrated the efficacy of glutamatergic drugs for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Recent data from magnetic resonance imaging studies provide an additional link between the glutamate system and anxiety. Collectively, the data suggest that future studies on the mechanism of and clinical efficacy of glutamatergic agents in anxiety disorders are appropriately warranted.", 
    "30": "Indiplon (NBI 34060) is a novel pyrazolopyrimidine currently in development for the treatment of insomnia. We have previously shown that indiplon exhibits high-affinity binding to native GABA(A) receptors from rat brain and acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptor currents in cultured rat neurons (Sullivan et al., 2004). In this study, we examined the GABA(A) receptor alpha subunit selectivity of indiplon using electrophysiological techniques to record GABA-activated chloride currents from recombinant rodent GABA(A) receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Indiplon potentiated the GABA-activated chloride current in recombinant GABA(A) receptors in a dose-dependent and reversible manner and was approximately 10-fold selective for alpha1 subunit-containing receptors over GABA(A) receptors containing alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 subunits. The EC(50) values were 2.6, 24, 60, and 77 nM for alpha1beta2gamma2, alpha2beta2gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, and alpha5beta2gamma2 receptors, respectively. Indiplon was approximately 10 times more potent than zolpidem and zopiclone and >100 times more potent than zaleplon. Moreover, indiplon, up to 1 microM, did not potentiate GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha4beta2gamma2 and alpha6beta2gamma2 subunits. This mechanism of action is proposed to underlie the sedative-hypnotic effects of indiplon in animals and humans.", 
    "31": "Pleconaril is a viral capsid inhibitor under evaluation for treatment of infections caused by rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. This study evaluated the effect of pleconaril on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity as assessed by intravenous (IV) midazolam. Healthy adults received oral pleconaril 400 mg 3 times daily for 16 doses. Single-dose, IV midazolam 0.025 mg/kg was administered before and during pleconaril administration. Midazolam and pleconaril plasma concentrations were assayed by LC/MS/MS. Bioequivalence was assessed by least squares geometric mean ratios (LS-GMR) with 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) for the measured midazolam pharmacokinetic parameters. Sixteen subjects were enrolled, and 14 subjects completed the study. Pleconaril decreased midazolam AUC(0-infinity) 28% and increased systemic clearance 39%. LS-GMR (90% CI) were 0.718 (0.674-0.765) and 1.392 (1.307-1.483), respectively. Plasma pleconaril concentrations steadily increased over time. Observed changes in midazolam AUC(0-infinity) and systemic clearance suggest that oral pleconaril increased hepatic CYP3A activity in healthy adults.", 
    "32": "This crossover study tested the hypothesis that both diazepam and microdose medetomidine would comparably reduce the amount of propofol required to induce sedation. Four different medications, namely high-dose diazepam (0.4 mg/kg intravenously [IV]), low-dose diazepam (0.2 mg/kg IV), medetomidine (1 mug/kg IV), and placebo (0.5 mL physiological saline IV) were followed by propofol (8 mg/kg IV) titrated to a point where intubation could be performed. The effects of medetomidine were comparable to the effects of high-dose diazepam and significantly better than the effects of low-dose diazepam or placebo. Dogs in all treatment groups had transient hypoxemia, and induction and recovery qualities were similar.", 
    "33": "It has been shown that ethanol produces a complex interoceptive cue in rodents with distinct GABAergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) components. The present study aimed to examine the contribution of the 5-HT system originating in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol in male Wistar rats. Therefore, selective lesions of 5-HT neurons in the DRN were induced by microinfusions of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. The DRN- and sham-lesioned rats were trained to discriminate ethanol (1.0 g/kg) from saline in a standard two-lever drug discrimination procedure. Acquisition of ethanol discrimination and discrimination performance after consumption of lower doses of ethanol did not differ between the groups. In substitution tests, diazepam (0.5-2.5 mg/kg), a nonselective benzodiazepine receptor agonist, partially generalized from the ethanol cue in both groups. In contrast, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (0.1-0.9 mg/kg), a mixed 5-HT(1B/2C) receptor agonist, did not mimic the ethanol cue. The drug decreased response rates in both groups, but this effect was more evident in the sham-lesioned group. A 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyloamino)-tetraline (0.05-0.4 mg/kg), did not produce significant increase in ethanol-appropriate responding in either group. These results may indicate that 5-HT neurons of the DRN are not critically involved in ethanol discrimination in the rat.", 
    "34": "In order to estimate the degree of glucose tolerance impairment, oral glucose tolerance test was conducted in the group of 15 schizophrenic patients taking olanzapine, the group of 15 schizophrenic patients taking risperidone and in the group of 14 healthy volunteers. In the olanzapine group the tolerance was impaired in 33% of the patients, contrary to the risperidone group in which impairment amounted to 20% of the patients. The authors discuss possible mechanisms responsible for impaired glucose tolerance in patients taking newer antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "35": "Methamphetamine use is a continuing problem in several regions of the United States and yet few studies have focused on prenatal methamphetamine exposure. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use-including methamphetamine-during pregnancy.", 
    "36": "The sample consisted of the first 1632 eligible mothers who consented to participate in a large-scale multisite study focused on prenatal methamphetamine exposure. This unselected screening sample included both users and nonusers of alcohol, tobacco, methamphetamine, and other drugs. Substance use was determined by maternal self-report and/or GC/MS confirmation of a positive meconium screen.", 
    "37": "Overall, 5.2% of women used methamphetamine at some point during their pregnancy. One quarter of the sample smoked tobacco, 22.8% drank alcohol, 6.0% used marijuana, and 1.3% used barbiturates prenatally. Less than 1% of the sample used heroin, benzodiazepines, and hallucinogens. Multivariate modeling results showed that tobacco smokers and illicit drug users were more likely to be single and less educated, have attended less than 11 prenatal visits, and utilize public financial assistance.", 
    "38": "This is the first large-scale investigation to report the prevalence of methamphetamine use during pregnancy in areas of the United States where methamphetamine is a notable concern. Follow-up research is ongoing to investigate the outcomes associated with prenatal methamphetamine exposure. Given that this research extends and confirms previous findings showing that high-risk groups of pregnant women can be identified on the basis of basic demographic characteristics, targeted interventions are greatly needed to reduce serious adverse outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol and tobacco use.", 
    "39": "We investigated the influence of a representative classical benzodiazepine on the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity both under basal conditions and stress. Adult male Wistar rats were intravenously administered with temazepam (0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg body weight) and plasma concentrations of corticotropin (ACTH) and vasopressin (AVP) were measured in blood samples collected via chronically implanted jugular venous catheters. Simultaneously, the release of AVP within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was monitored via microdialysis. Plasma AVP levels remained unaffected by the different treatment conditions. Temazepam blunted the stressor exposure-induced secretion of ACTH in a dose-dependent manner. Concurrently, and also in a dose-dependent manner temazepam enhanced the intra-PVN release of AVP, known to originate from magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic neurohypophyseal system. Furthermore, temazepam did not affect the in vitro secretion of ACTH from the adenohypophyseal cells. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that temazepam modulates the central nervous regulation of the HPA axis by altering intra-PVN AVP release. An increasingly released AVP of magnocellular origin seems to provide a negative tonus on ACTH secretion most probably via inhibiting the release of ACTH secretagogues from the median eminence into hypophyseal portal blood.",

However, some patients may not actually die of their injuries but may undergo withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). The goal of this study was to determine which factors were associated with WLST among older patients who died. We hypothesized that patients with comorbid illnesses, higher injury severity scores (ISS), complications, and existing advanced directives (AD) would be more likely to have WLST and that patients having WLST would receive more medication for symptom relief in the 24 hours before death.",

ADs were available for 15 patients (23.4%), and 11 (17.2%) patients had expressed to their families desires to not undergo aggressive curative care. Family discussions were documented for 50 (78%) cases. Comorbid illnesses were present in 46 (71.9%) patients and 35 (54.7%) developed at least one complication. Among people with ADs, 73% had WLST versus 49% of people without ADs (p = 0.09). WLST was independent of comorbid illnesses (p = 0.3), complications (p = 0.8), age (p = 0.5), and ISS (p = 0.2). Patients for whom there was documentation of a family discussion were more likely to have WLST than those without (91.4% versus 62.1%, p = 0.005).

We reported that Dai-kenchu-to increases plasma neuropeptide [motilin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P]-like immunoreactive substances (IS) levels and that its pharmacologic effects on the gastrointestine are due to changes in gastrointestinal mucosa-regulatory peptide levels. We examined the effects of the selective M(1) muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on the elevation of Dai-kenchu-to-induced plasma neuropeptide (gastrin, motilin, somatostatin, VIP, CGRP, substance P)-IS levels in human volunteers and the area under the plasma neuropeptide concentration-time curve from 0 to 240 min (AUC(0-->240 min)), which were calculated from the plasma neuropeptide concentration-time curves from each volunteers. Oral pretreatment with pirenzepine reduced the Dai-kenchu-to-induced elevation of plasma motilin and VIP-IS levels and AUC(0-->240 min). Combined treatment with Dai-kenchu-to and pirenzepine increased plasma somatostatin-IS levels and decreased plasma gastrin-IS levels and had no effects on plasma CGRP- and substance P-IS levels and AUC(0-->240 min) compared with administration of Dai-kenchu-to alone. Dai-kenchu-to appeared to induce the release of motilin and VIP into plasma mainly through the activation of M(1) muscarinic receptors, and pirenzepine may affect the pharmacologic action of Dai-kenchu-to by elevation of plasma motilin and VIP levels.", 
    "49": "It is well established that human diseases associated with abnormal immune function, including some common infectious diseases and asthma, are considerably more prevalent at younger ages. Although not established absolutely, it is generally believed that development constitutes a period of increased immune system susceptibility to xenobiotics, since adverse effects may occur at lower doses and/or immunomodulation may be more persistent, thus increasing the relative risk of xenobiotic exposure to the immunologically immature organism. To address this issue, a brief overview of immune maturation in humans is provided to demonstrate that functional immaturity alone predisposes the young to infection. Age-dependent differences in the immunotoxic effects of five diverse compounds, diethylstilbestrol (DES), diazepam (DZP), lead (Pb), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and tributyltin oxide (TBTO), which have undergone adult and developmental immunotoxicity testing in rodents, are then reviewed, as are human data when available. For all five chemicals, the developing immune system was found to be at greater risk than that of the adult, either because lower doses produced immunotoxicity, adverse effects were more persistent, or both.", 
    "50": "Data are reported from drug diversion cases involving health care workers who were investigated by the Cincinnati Police Division Pharmaceutical Diversion Squad over an 11-year period. This type of information is rarely available because few U.S. police jurisdictions dedicate resources to prescription drug diversion surveillance. Data from 1992 through 2002 show that opioids were the drugs most commonly diverted by health care workers, followed by benzodiazepines. Nurses, nursing assistants, and medical assistants were involved in almost three quarters of all cases. Hospitals were the most common sources of complaint to police, followed by pharmacies. Health care professional associations are advised to promote greater awareness of drug misuse and dependence concerns among their memberships, and health care facilities that stock pharmaceuticals liable for misuse and diversion are advised to increase the security of their supplies.", 
    "51": "The present study investigates the effects of a chronic administration of diazepam, a benzodiazepine widely used as an anxiolytic, on locomotor activity and body core temperature rhythms in male Wistar rats housed under 12 : 12 light : dark (LD) cycle conditions. Diazepam was administered subcutaneously for 3 wks in a dosage of 3 mg/kg body weight/day, 1 h before the onset of darkness. Diazepam increased the level of locomotor activity from the first day until the end of treatment, and also increased the amplitude of the activity circadian rhythm, but only on the third wk of treatment. Diazepam exerted no effects on the length of the period and did not affect the phase of the locomotor activity rhythm. The body temperature rhythm of rats was affected neither by short-term (a single injection) nor by long-term (every day for 3 wks) diazepam treatment. Diazepam lacked effect on body core temperature even on the first day of administration, thereby ruling out the possibility of drug tolerance development. The fact that diazepam affects locomotor activity, but not core body temperature, suggests that different mechanisms mediate the actions of diazepam on locomotor activity and on core body temperature.",

Hemodynamic parameters and levels of sedation were assessed and recorded by a single observer at 3-min intervals. The Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale (ranging 1-5) is a subjective sedation assessment scale used to assess sedation levels.

This increase in violence risk was similar among individuals combining alcohol with benzodiazepines [Relative risk (RR) = 13.2, 95% CI: 4.9-35.3]. Use of benzodiazepines alone in regular doses (RR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.5) or antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclics] (RR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) was associated with a lowered risk for violence.",

    "62": "Effects of hyperthermia-induced seizures (HS) on GABAA and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in immature rat brain were evaluated using in vitro autoradiography. HS were induced in 10-day-old rats by a regulated stream of moderately heated air directed 50 cm above the animals. Rats were killed 30 min, 24 h, or 20 days after HS and their brains were used for in vitro autoradiography experiments to determine GABAA and BDZ receptor binding. GABAA binding was significantly enhanced in all brain areas evaluated 30 min after HS, an effect that endures 24 h and 20 days after seizures. Concerning BDZ receptor binding, a significant increase was detected in entorhinal and perirhinal cortices and decreased in basolateral amygdala 30 min following HS. One day after HS, animals demonstrated enhanced BDZ binding in the cingulate, frontal, posterior parietal, entorhinal, temporal, and perirhinal cortices; striatum, accumbens, substantia nigra pars compacta, and amygdala nuclei. Twenty days after HS enhanced BDZ binding was restricted in the cingulated, frontal, anterior and posterior parietal cortices, as well as in substantia nigra pars reticulata, whereas decreased values were found in accumbens nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta. Our data indicate differential effects of HS in GABAA and BDZ binding in immature brain. HS-induced GABAA and BDZ changes are different from those previously described in experimental models of temporal lobe epilepsy in adult animals.", 
    "63": "Pineal hormone melatonin is proposed as a potential treatment for severe sleep disturbances, and various gastrointestinal disorders. It was shown that melatonin increases intestinal motility and influences the activity of myoelectric complexes of the gut. The aim of the study was to evaluate the mechanisms of the effect of exogenous melatonin on gastric emptying rate. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fitted with gastric cannulas under anesthesia. The rate of gastric emptying of saline was determined after instillation into the gastric fistula, from the volume and phenol red concentrations recovered after 5 min. Melatonin injected intraperitoneally (ip; 0.001-100 mg/kg) delayed gastric emptying rate of saline at 3 and 10 mg/kg doses. When administered ip 15 min before melatonin (10 mg/kg) injections, CCK2 (L-365,260, 1 mg/kg) or 5-HT3 receptor (ramosetrone, 50 microg/kg) blockers abolished melatonin-induced delay in gastric emptying rate, while the blockade of sympathetic ganglia (bretylium tosylate, 15 mg/kg) significantly reduced the delay in gastric emptying rate. CCK1 receptor blocker (L-364,718, 1 mg/kg) had no significant effect on the delaying action of melatonin. Our results indicate that pharmacological doses of melatonin delay gastric emptying via mechanisms that involve CCK2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Moreover, it appears that exogenous melatonin inhibits gastric motility in part by activating sympathetic neurons.", 
    "64": "Antipsychotics are the drugs of choice for the treatment of schizophrenia. Besides blocking monoamine receptors, these molecules affect intracellular signaling mechanisms, resulting in long-term synaptic alterations. Western blot analysis was used to investigate the effect of long-term administration (14 days) with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the atypical olanzapine on the expression and phosphorylation state of extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), proteins involved in the regulation of multiple intracellular signaling cascades. A single injection of both drugs produced an overall decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in different subcellular compartments. Conversely, long-term treatment with olanzapine, but not haloperidol, increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex in a compartment-specific and time-dependent fashion. In fact, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was elevated in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions 2 h after the last drug administration, whereas it was enhanced only in the membrane fraction when the animals were killed 24 h after the last injection. This effect might be the result of an activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, because the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 was also increased by long-term olanzapine administration. Our data demonstrate that long-term exposure to olanzapine dynamically regulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in different subcellular compartments, revealing a novel mechanism of action for this atypical agent and pointing to temporally separated locations of signaling events mediated by these kinases after long-term olanzapine administration.",

It has been reported that the regional density of PBR in the brain is increased in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Thus, a reliable tracer method for evaluating PBR would be of use clinically and for research.

But the interindividual differences in the distribution volume of the free and nonspecific binding compartment (K(1)/k(2)) were relatively large. In a simulation study, variation of the DV estimated by Logan plot was relatively small, but it was underestimated as the noise increased. By MA, the bias of DV was smaller, but the variation of DV was larger than by Logan plot. Within a 3% noise level, there was almost no difference between Logan plot and MA in both bias and variation. DVs estimated by both Logan plot and MA were underestimated by 10%-20%. Although the variation of DV was larger by NLS than by Logan plot, it was small enough in the noise level of VOI analysis, and the bias of DV was 0%-2%.",

    "73": "In France, psychotropic drugs may be classified in four categories according to their official data. The first category corresponds to psychotropic drugs with an approved indication available in paediatry. Theyare old agents (e.g. haloperidol, amitriptyline, benzodiazepines...) with the exception of methylphenidate (hyperactivity). The second one corresponds to pharmacological agents approved for some indications obtained with adults but not for a1l (i.e. restricted indication: e.g. sertraline approved in paediatry only for OCD but not for depression, risperidone approved only for the treatment of disruptive behaviors in children with subaverage IQs). For the third category, the psychotropic agent is either contraindicated or unadvised under the age of 15 or 18 years, by lack of data (e.g. most of SSRI or atypical antipsychotic drugs). For the last category, official data available in brief summaries offer no information on paediatric use and consequently their administration does not appear possible. Up to now, no approved use has been delivered to injection route (IM or IV) in France, except for an IM formulation of zuclopenthixol. Prescribing psychotropic drug has to respect good practices including close psychological and somatic monitoring that associates the young patient and his relative (psycho-education program). Particular key-points should be taken into consideration (i.e. pharmacokinetic and physiological specificities, risk of false passage under the age of 6 years with capsules or tablets, presence of alcohol in some oral solution or bitter aroma...). Beside these official data, many studies have been published but must be carefully interpreted according to their level of pertinence. Meta-analysis gather all randomised controlled trials published or not, analyse their specific pertinence and thus provide clinically relevant elements. Randomised controlled trials present clinical interest but key-points in study design must be checked (e.g. number of patients, inclusion and exclusion criteria, length of the study and clinical relevance of clinical scales...). Other studies like open trials or clinical cases do not offersufficient guarantees. Some randomised controlled trials of clinical relevance have been carried out in this population with new pharmacological classes (eg SSRI, atypical antipsychotic drugs) and may lead to extended indications in children and adolescents. According to bibliographic and official data, the main criteria in the prescribing choice may take into consideration the following sis stressing a poor benefit/risk ratio. SSRI may offer better prospects but their use has not been approved in this indication, until now. In OCD, sertraline shows great interest to enhance clinical response and represents the molecule of reference. No drug has been approved for mood disorders in children or adolescent, in France, contrary to USA where lithium can be administered over the age of 12 years. In addition, antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine or divalproate have conducted to clinical improvement in some studies. Benzodiazepines, hydroxyzine and meprobamate use should be strictly restricted in case of anxiety symptoms but are the only agents approved in this indication despise promising results obtained with SSRI. Transitory insomnia may take advantage of alimemazine prescription (approved use over the age of 36 months). Some typical neuroleptics are indicated in tics or in behaviour disorders associated to autism or related syndromes but present clinical limitations and poor tolerability. Promising clinical trials (randomised or not) have been conducted with new atypical antipsychotic drugs like risperidone. In conclusion, present data available for paediatric use of psychotropic agents emphasizes that safety and effectiveness are not always well established in particular for the treatment of chronic disorders (long term tolerability assessment). Moreover, studies should be carried out to specify factors promoting adherence and quality of life for this young population in order to optimise clinical benefit of drug prescription.",

    "84": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) might be involved in certain pathophysiological events, such as anxiety, by stimulating the production of neuroactive steroids in the brain. A recent electrophysiological study has revealed an interaction between PK11195, a PBR ligand and the anxiolytic compound etifoxine at micromolar concentrations. The present work was aimed at further characterizing the etifoxine-PBR interaction. In membrane preparations from intact male rat forebrain, etifoxine uncompetitively inhibited the binding of [(3)H]PK11195 with an IC(50) = 18.3 +/- 1.2 microM, a value consistent with etifoxine plasma and brain concentrations measured after an anxiolytic-like dose (50 mg/kg). In vivo, that etifoxine dose was associated with increased concentrations of pregnenolone, progesterone, 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone in plasma and brain of sham-operated animals. In adrenalectomized and castrated rats, etifoxine enhanced the brain levels of these steroids, suggesting a stimulation of their local synthesis and/or a decrease of their disappearance rate, independently of peripheral sources. Finasteride, an inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase that converts progesterone into its 5alpha-reduced metabolites like allopregnanolone, attenuated the anti-conflict effect of etifoxine even though brain allopregnanolone contents were drastically reduced. These results indicate that following activation of the PBR in the brain, an increased cerebral production of allopregnanolone, a potent positive modulator of the GABA(A) receptor function, may partially contribute to the anxiolytic-like effects of etifoxine.",

By 10 minutes, 41 of 74 (55.4%) from the midazolam group were sedated compared to 42 of 79 (53.2%) from droperidol, a difference of 2.2% (95% CI -14.9% to 19.3%; P=.91). Eleven adverse events occurred in the midazolam group and 10 in the droperidol group. Three patients required active airway management (3 patients with assisted ventilation and 1 patient intubated); all received midazolam.",

    "92": "Imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2-b][1,2,4]triazines are ligands for the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors that are functionally selective for the alpha2/alpha3 subtypes over the alpha1 subtype. SAR studies to optimise this functional selectivity, pharmacokinetic and behavioural data are described.", 
    "93": "The aim of the present work is to demonstrate the putative sedative and anxiolytic-like effects of a hydro-ethanolic extract obtained from the aerial parts of Aloysia polystachya (Verbenaceae) in male mice using several behavioural assays. Groups of male mice orally treated with doses of 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 mg/kg of the extract did not show any significant alteration of their locomotor activity, body temperature or motor coordination. The same treatment increased the duration of the sleeping time induced by 30.0 mg/kg i.p. of sodium pentobarbital. However, the sleeping time induced by ethyl ether was not modified by the oral administration of the extract, not confirming the putative sedative effect of the plant. The ethanolic extract also significantly increased the percentage of both entries (1.0 and 100.0 mg/kg) and the time spent (10.0 and 100.0 mg/kg) into the open arms of the elevated plus maze (EPM). Nevertheless, the binding of (3)H-flunitrazepam ((3)H-FNZ) to the benzodiazepine binding site (BDZ-bs), in washed crude synaptosomal membranes from rat cerebral cortex, was not affected by the semi-purified components from Aloysia polystachya. These results indicate an anxiolytic-like profile of action for the extract of Aloysia polystachya without sedative side effect, being this activity probably mediated by other mechanism than BDZ-bs modulation at the GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "94": "Pharmacoepidemiological studies exploring utilisation of psychotropic medications in real-life conditions are required to identify extension of indications, since the risk of gap between the theoretical target population and the population actually treated is especially marked for this class of drugs. A large proportion of subjects from the general population are exposed to psychotropic medications, so even a small increase in the risk of adverse effect may have major deleterious consequences for the health of the general population. Hence, pharmacoepidemiological studies are also required to explore the risk/benefit ratio of these drugs in real-life conditions. These studies may provide answers to currently unsolved public health questions, such as the long-term cognitive impact of exposure to benzodiazepines, the impact of antidepressant on suicidal behaviour, or the risks associated with enlarged use of antipsychotics. Only findings obtained by such studies may allow risk management and elaboration of guidelines based upon factual data.", 
    "95": "In contrast to research studies that limit the use of concomitant psychotropic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia, polypharmacy is common in real-world, clinical practice. The use of psychotropic medications as an adjunct to antipsychotic agents is often necessitated by the poor response to monotherapy with one antipsychotic agent. This paper discusses the prevalence of polypharmacy in clinical settings, reviews the evidence for the adjunctive use of antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, lithium, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and other psychotropics in the treatment of schizophrenia, and offers suggestions toward use of polypharmacy in difficult and practical clinical settings.", 
    "96": "Objective. To evaluate dosing and time to efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in an acute inpatient unit. Methods. Admissions during 2001 were reviewed. Patients primarily treated with an atypical antipsychotic (including those simultaneously commenced on a mood stabiliser and/or antidepressant or receiving benzodiazepines) were evaluated. Non-acute patients, those without medical records or transferred to other hospitals were excluded. Medication details were noted. Results. A total of 137 patients were evaluated; 56 (41%) had received risperidone, 38 (28%) olanzapine, and 37 (27%) quetiapine. Mean doses (mg/day) at discharge were risperidone 4.1\u00b12.3, olanzapine 22.5\u00b110.2, quetiapine 576\u00b1472. Dose ranges (mg/day) were risperidone 0.5-12, olanzapine 5-40, quetiapine 50-1800. No differences between atypicals in time to efficacy/concomitant anticholinergics/mood stabilisers were observed. Benzodiazepine use was more frequent with risperidone and olanzapine than quetiapine. No serious side effects with any drug were noted. Quetiapine was rapidly titrated in 20 patients (up to 400 mg on Day 1). In 18 of these, acute disturbance was controlled. Two patients were switched for lack of efficacy, one due to persistent tachycardia, and five for concern about early postural hypotension. Conclusion. These data provide further evidence concerning dose and dose range of atypicals required for optimal clinical outcome. More rapid initiation with quetiapine may be of benefit to some patients in the acute inpatient setting.", 
    "97": "Evidence-based medicine combines the best currently available evidence from systematic medical research, together with clinical expertise, in order to provide the best available care for patients. In conjunction with systematic reviews (meta-analyses), a critical review of evidence-based literature forms the basis for the development of clinical treatment guidelines. Current treatment guidelines for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) advocate the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as the first line of pharmacotherapy. The safety and tolerability profiles of other medications, such as the benzodiazepines, limit their use, especially for long-term treatment. Since data comparing the efficacy in GAD of different SSRIs are limited, selection of one SSRI over another is generally based on consideration of tolerability profiles. Treatment guidelines for patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) often recommend SSRIs as the first line of medication treatment, as this class has the largest evidence-base in support of efficacy. Less consistent evidence of efficacy exists for other agents, such as reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase inhibitor A (RIMAs), and issues of safety are a concern when considering the use of benzodiazepines. Again, there are few head-to-head studies of the SSRIs, and treatment selection is usually made on the basis of tolerability issues. The efficacy and tolerability of the SSRI, escitalopram, has been evaluated in patients with GAD and with SAD. In long-term studies of SAD, escitalopram demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and paroxetine. It also exhibited a better tolerability profile, as assessed by discontinuation emergent signs and symptoms (DESS), in both patient groups. Furthermore, in relapse prevention trials of SAD, escitalopram conferred a significant benefit relative to placebo.", 
    "98": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common, chronic and disabling anxiety disorder with considerable comorbidity with depression as well as with other anxiety disorders. Although tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines have been found to be efficacious in patients with GAD, tolerability problems and other risks limit their use in clinical practice. In placebo-controlled, acute (<8\u2009weeks) trials, several medications, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ([SSRIs] escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline) and others (venlafaxine, buspirone, pregabalin), have demonstrated efficacy in patients with GAD. Indeed, current guidelines for the treatment of GAD recommend SSRIs as first-line pharmacological therapy because of their efficacy and tolerability profiles. Although GAD is a chronic condition that is usually present for years, with symptoms typically fluctuating in intensity over time, there have been few randomized, controlled trials of pharmacotherapy beyond the acute phase of treatment. However, data from recent relapse-prevention studies and longer-term maintenance studies with paroxetine, venlafaxine and escitalopram strongly support the value of continued treatment for at least a further 6 months. This article focuses on pharmacological treatment, and reviews recently available data from acute, long-term and relapse-prevention trials in patients with GAD. In addition, issues relating to the natural course of GAD are highlighted as important considerations to guide selection of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "99": "Anxiety disorders have a high prevalence, particularly specific phobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The lifetime prevalence for any anxiety disorder is almost 30%. Also, many anxiety disorders have a high rate of comorbid depression, which is generally secondary to the anxiety. Despite high prevalence, anxiety disorders are under-diagnosed, misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. There is a hierarchy in the lifetime probability of treatment contact, with panic and GAD being diagnosed and treated earlier - possibly as a result of these disorders being the most \"visible\", unlike SAD, which is characteristically discreet. Under-diagnosis is linked with under-treatment: less than one in five patients with an anxiety disorder receive appropriate medication, which improves to almost one in three for subjects with comorbid depression. For the majority of people with undiagnosed or untreated anxiety disorder, there are many negative consequences, for both the individual and society. These include disability, reduced ability to work leading to loss of productivity, and a high risk of suicide. All of these factors contribute to a reduced quality of life. The economic costs associated with anxiety disorders are large - \u20ac48 billion over 28 European countries - and similar to those for dementia. Almost half of the costs are indirect, due to loss of productivity and earnings; the remainder being direct medical and non-medical costs. Current first-line therapies are the antidepressive selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with cognitive behavioural therapy a first- or second-line treatment. However, benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed more often than antidepressants. Recent studies have shown that a new type of SSRI, escitalopram (the S-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram), with a unique mode of action, is effective and offers potential as a new treatment for anxiety disorders.", 
    "100": "A variety of agents are currently used to treat the different anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are still preferred by some for the treatment of acute anxiety, with the advantage of a rapid onset of action, but they are less suitable for long-term treatment due to their potential for memory disturbances, sleepiness, lethargy, physical dependence and withdrawal. Compounds acting on monoamine neurotransmission are more suitable in the treatment of long-term or chronic anxiety disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors have been shown to be effective anxiolytics, but their side effects and safety concerns have limited their use. The probable role of disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission in anxiety is widely accepted and is the theoretical basis for the use of serotonergic agents such as the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, buspirone, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), such as sertraline and paroxetine, which have largely replaced the earlier antidepressants. There is clear evidence for decreased serotonergic function in anxiety as well as in depression. Studies of patients with anxiety disorders show reduced levels of serotonin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as reduced serotonin transporter binding. The role of noradrenaline in the control of anxiety is less well understood, although there is considerable evidence to suggest that a disturbance of noradrenergic neurotransmission may also contribute to the symptoms of anxiety. Noradrenaline modulates the activity of brain regions such as the amygdala which are associated with anxiety. In addition, anxiety states are associated with increases in the metabolite of noradrenaline, 3-methoxy-4-hydrophenylglycol (MHPG), and hypersecretion of noradrenaline in plasma and CSF. It appears likely that modulation of both serotonin and noradrenaline systems by dual-reuptake inhibitors may prove to be an advantage in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), venlafaxine, milnacipran and duloxetine are efficacious in relieving anxiety symptoms within depression, and some have proven efficacy in certain anxiety disorders. Initial studies suggest that dual acting agents may have an advantage over selective reuptake inhibitors in certain anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression.", 
    "101": "The objective of this analysis was to determine the diagnostic utility of oral fluid testing collected with the Intercept oral fluid collection device.", 
    "102": "TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Opioids (opiates or narcotics) are a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy plant that typically relieve pain and produce a euphoric feeling. Methadone is a long-acting synthetic opioid used to treat opioid dependence and chronic pain. It prevents symptoms of opioid withdrawal, reduces opioid cravings and blocks the euphoric effects of short-acting opioids such as heroin and morphine. Opioid dependence is associated with harms including an increased risk of exposure to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Hepatitis C as well as other health, social and psychological crises. The goal of methadone treatment is harm reduction. Treatment with methadone for opioid dependence is often a long-term therapy. The Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons estimates that there are currently 250 physicians qualified to prescribe methadone, and 15,500 people in methadone maintenance programs across Ontario. Drug testing is a clinical tool whose purpose is to provide objective meaningful information, which will reinforce positive behavioral changes in patients and guide further treatment needs. Such information includes knowledge of whether the patient is taking their methadone as prescribed and reducing or abstaining from using opioid and other drugs of abuse use. The results of drug testing can be used with behavior modification techniques (contingency management techniques) where positive reinforcements such as increased methadone take-home privileges, sustained employment or parole are granted for drug screens negative for opioid use, and negative reinforcement including loss of these privileges for drug screens positive for opioid used. Body fluids including blood, oral fluid, often referred to as saliva, and urine may contain metabolites and the parent drug of both methadone and drugs of abuse and provide a means for drug testing. Compared with blood which has a widow of detection of several hours, urine has a wider window of detection, approximately 1 to 3 days, and is therefore considered more useful than blood for drug testing. Because of this, and the fact that obtaining a urine specimen is relatively easy, urine drug screening is considered the criterion measure (gold standard) for methadone maintenance monitoring. However, 2 main concerns exist with urine specimens: the possibility of sample tampering by the patient and the necessity for observed urine collection. Urine specimens may be tampered with in 3 ways: dilution, adulteration (contamination) with chemicals, and substitution (patient submits another persons urine specimen). To circumvent sample tampering the supervised collection of urine specimens is a common and recommended practice. However, it has been suggested that this practice may have negative effects including humiliation experienced by patient and staff, and may discourage patients from staying in treatment. Supervised urine specimen collection may also present an operational problem as staff must be available to provide same-sex supervision. Oral fluid testing has been proposed as a replacement for urine because it can be collected easily under direct supervision without infringement of privacy and reduces the likelihood of sample tampering. Generally, the results of oral fluid drug testing are similar to urine drug testing but there are some differences, such as lower concentrations of substances in oral fluid than urine, and some drugs remain detectable for longer periods of time in urine than oral fluid.", 
    "103": "The Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device (Ora-Sure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA) consists of an absorbent pad mounted on a plastic stick. The pad is coated with common salts. The absorbent pad is inserted into the mouth and placed between the cheek and gums for 3 minutes on average. The pad absorbs the oral fluid. After 3 minutes (range 2min-5 min) the collection device is removed from the mouth and the absorbent pad is placed in a small vial which contains 0.8mL of pH-balanced preservative, for transportation to a laboratory for analysis. It is recommended that the person undergoing oral fluid drug testing have nothing to eat or drink for a 10- minute period before the oral fluid specimen is collected. This will remove opportunity for adulteration. Likewise, it is recommended that the person be observed for the duration of the collection period to prevent adulteration of the specimen. An average of 0.4 mL of saliva can be collected. The specimen may be stored at 4C to 37C and tested within 21 days of collection (or within 6 weeks if frozen). The oral fluid specimen must be analyzed in a laboratory setting. There is no point-of-care (POC) oral fluid test kit for drugs of abuse (other than for alcohol). In the laboratory the oral fluid is extracted from the vial after centrifugation and a screening test is completed to eliminate negative specimens. Similar to urinalysis, oral fluid specimens are analyzed first by enzyme immunoassay with positive specimens sent for confirmatory testing. Comparable cut-off values to urinalysis by enzyme immunoassay have been developed for oral fluids",

Two other relevant studies were found after corresponding with the author of the 2 studies retrieved from the literature search. Therefore a total of 4 published studies are included in this analysis. All 4 studies carried out by the same investigator meet the definition of Medical Advisory Secretariat level III (not a-randomized controlled trial with contemporaneous controls) study design. In each of the studies, paired urine and oral fluid specimens where obtained from drug users. Urine collection was not observed in the studies however, laboratory tests for pH and creatinine were used to determine the reliability of the specimen. Urine specimens thought to be diluted and unreliable were removed from the evaluation. Urinalysis was used as the criterion measurement for which to determine the sensitivity and specificity of oral fluid testing by the Intercept oral fluid device for opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and marijuana. Alcohol was not tested in any of the 4 studies. From these 4 studies, the following conclusions were drawn: The evidence indicates that oral fluid testing with the Intercept oral fluid device has better specificity than sensitivity for opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and marijuana.THE SENSITIVITY OF ORAL FLUIDS TESTING WITH THE INTERCEPT ORAL FLUID DEVICE SEEMS TO BE FROM BEST TO WORST: cocaine > benzodiazepines >opiates> marijuana.The sensitivity and specificity for opiates of the Intercept oral fluid device ranges from 75 to 90% and 97- 100% respectively.The consequences of opiate false-negatives by oral fluid testing with the Intercept oral fluid device need to be weighed against the disadvantages of urine testing, including invasion of privacy issues and adulteration and substitution of the urine specimen.The window of detection is narrower for oral fluid drug testing than urinalysis and because of this oral fluid testing may best be applied in situations where there is suspected frequent drug use. When drug use is thought to be less frequent or remote, urinalysis may offer a wider (24-48 hours more than oral fluids) window of detection.The narrow window of detection for oral fluid testing may mean more frequent testing is needed compared to urinalysis. This may increase the expense for drug testing in general.POC oral fluid testing is not yet available and may limit the practical utility of this drug testing methodology. POC urinalysis by immunoassay is available.The possible applications of oral fluid testing may include:Because of its narrow window of detection compared to urinalysis oral fluid testing may best be used during periods of suspected frequent or recent drug use (within 24 hours of drug testing). This is not to say that oral fluid testing is superior to urinalysis during these time periods.In situations where an observed urine specimen is difficult to obtain. This may include persons with \"shy bladder syndrome\" or with other urinary conditions limiting their ability to provide an observed urine specimen.When the health of the patient would make urine testing unreliable (e,g., renal disease)As an alternative drug testing method when urine specimen tampering practices are suspected to be affecting the reliability of the urinalysis test.Possible limiting Factors to Diffusion of Oral Fluid Technology No oral fluid POC test equivalent to onsite urine dips or POC analyzer reducing immediacy of results for patient care.Currently, physicians get reimbursed directly for POC urinalysis.

    "111": "The HTA report had to investigate the following questions: Which evidence do diagnostic methods in recognition of tinnitus have? Which types of therapy show medical effectiveness at the acute or chronic tinnitus without an organic cause? Which consequences (need for further research, future procedures) can be drawn?",

    "114": "The diagnostic confirmation of the non-specific tinnitus without organic cause meets with the problem of the assurance of the diagnosis tinnitus. According to the current opinion the stepwise diagnostics is carried out also in the case of the so called subjective tinnitus. Nothing can be said about the evidence of these procedures since no publication was found about that. A study concerning the evidence of the diagnostic questionnaires from Goebel and Hiller [1] comes to the end that the tinnitus questionnaire frequently used (TF) [2] is the best evaluated procedure. The number of therapies which treat tinnitus is exceptionally high and makes clear, that the search for \"the\" tinnitus therapy is still going on. According to the current knowledge tinnitus genesis is multifactorial and therefore there can't be any standard therapy for tinnitus. The following seven categories can be distinguished: AD 1: MACHINE-AIDED ACOUSTIC THERAPIES From many studies regarding machine-aided acoustic therapy of tinnitus only two showed an evidence degree that allows scientifically correct statements about the effectiveness of these procedures. Selectively significant improvements could be shown in the comparison with a placebo (apparatus switched off) a superiority of tinnitus-maskers. AD 2: ELECTROSTIMULATION In an application study of electro-stimulation the results were not evaluated statistically, but it was described descriptively that a successful medical treatment can be expected in about 50% of the cases. AD 3: PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY PROCEDURES Hypnosis did not show positive effectiveness. With regard to biofeedback it can be concluded that this method can be effective in individual cases, however regarded as unreliable from missing reproducibility. Neurobiofeedback could prove that it had a positive therapeutic effect. From eight controlled studies to relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy four studies showed a therapeutic effectiveness and four failed. Combined therapies proved generally to be more effective than individual types. The behaviour medical psychotherapy could show a positive therapy effect. In a study with cognitive therapy and relaxation (three groups, a passive relaxation, an active relaxation and a cognitive therapy) short-term successes could be stated (for one month), however, the parameters of success returned on the initial value after four months. Also only coincidental and short-term successes could be achieved with cognitive behaviour therapy training, autogenic training and structured group psychotherapy. AD 4: TINNITUS RETRAINING THERAPY (TRT) Unfortunately, the published results of the TRT are methodically frequently bad and scientific of a poor value. Many of the studies presented until now regarding tinnitus retraining therapy are not informative in their scientific context. In a study with 95 patients with a chronic tinnitus TRT could show a significant, more than six months lasting stable success by comparison to a combination of TET with group behaviour therapy (improvement be achieved around at least ten points in the tinnitus questionnaire (TF)). AD 5: PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES Rheological drugs (medicines for hemodilution) could not show any statistically significant effect in the treatment of tinnitus. Studies to the medical treatment with tocainides (lidocaine) showed repeatable positive effects on tinnitus in higher dosages (as of 1.2 mg/day). Lamotrigine as a medicine had an effect positively only at with a small fraction of patients. Two studies with GABA receptor agonists could not prove therapeutic effects for tinnitus. Undesired side-effects were observed. Injections with Carvoverine (a glutamate antagonist) achieved significantly successes with a special form of tinnitus, the \"Cochlear-synaptic tinnitus (CST)\". A tricyclic antidepressant (Amitriptilin) could prove superiority against placebo. This effect could be confirmed in another study. However Clonazepame (a benzodiazepine), could not achieve any improvement. Short-term improvements were achieved with other benzodiazepines (Clonazepame, Diazepam, Flurazepame, Oxacepame and Alprazolame). A German retrospective study suggests a graded pharmacological therapy by means of rheological infusion therapy, applications of neurotransmitters, and injections of lidocaine. This method achieved a disappearance or a recovery of the complaints at 95.3% of the acute and 26.7% of the chronic cases. AD 6: SURGICAL PROCEDURES The effects of the operative excision of the stapes (stapedectomy) showed significant effects concerning tinnitus. This method is a routine operation to recover hearing, effects on tinnitus were observed only coincidently. There are generally high frequencies of improvements of tinnitus after cochlea implantations; however the risk of deterioration is present with this method. AD 7: OTHER AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPY PROCEDURES The hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be considered successful after acute events with tinnitus. The therapy should be started in the first month after appearance of the tinnitus. The methods transcranial-, electromagnetic and transcutaneous nerve stimulations did not show any significant effects on tinnitus. Also low laser medical treatment showed disappointing effects. The \"pneumatic external contra-pulsation\" is described as an unproblematic usable procedure by the authors of the examination, but 10% of the patients had to stop the medical treatment because of complications associated with the medical treatment. Acupuncture showed significant improvements in comparison to medical treatment. The effectiveness of this therapy could not be reproduced in another study. Five other studies between 1993 and 1999 also did not show any therapeutic effect of this method. Gingko-Biloba preparations did not show any positive effects in large-scale studies on tinnitus.",

Unsolved problems concerning insurance, economic as well as legal problems have resulted for the patients and for caring stuff from this unsatisfactory situation.

No convergence of the therapy procedures can be seen within the last decades of tinnitus research, contrariwise there is always more and more \"creativity\" of new approaches. Priority has to be given to find the cause of tinnitus since therapies are a consequence of a better understanding of these symptoms that evidence oriented investigations on an usual scientific level can be started.",

Examinations which are carried out also with small numbers show often methodical insufficiencies. It is necessary that minimal requirements on a scientifically clinical experiment, such as design, case number calculation, analytic statistics, control group, are fulfilled. It is recommendable, that further research has to be promoted regarding tinnitus causes that a coordinated evidence-orientated treatment will be developed.",

Total saliva was collected 2 hours postintraperitoneal administration of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg), L-Arginine (250 mg/kg), and L-NAME (10 mg/kg) intraorally by polyethylene cannula from anaesthetized rats for 30 min using pilocarpine (6 mg/kg) as secretagogue. Chlordiazepoxide reduced flow rate to 43%, total protein concentration to 30%, calcium concentration to 33%, and amylase activity to 33% of control. Potassium and sodium levels were not affected by chlordiazepoxide. L-Arginine increased flow rate to 10%, total protein to 65%, and calcium to 17%, while L-NAME decreased flow rate to 9%, total protein to 55%, and calcium to 25%. Concurrent treatment of rats by chlordiazepoxide plus L-Arginine or L-NAME influenced chlordiazepoxide-induced alterations in saliva composition. The inhibitory effects of chlordiazepoxide on salivary flow rate, amylase activity, and concentrations of total protein and calcium were blocked by L-Arginine while potentiated by L-NAME coadministrations. It is concluded that benzodiazepines induce toxicity in salivary gland function by disturbing the homeostasis of inositol triphosphate and Ca homeostasis in the cells. Administration of L-Arginine prevents benzodiazepine-induced toxicity most probably through its vasoregulatory action and balancing intracellular Ca homeostasis.",

    "124": "The results strongly suggest that type 3 patients with reduced CBF and CVR may be divided into 2 pathophysiologically different subgroups: misery perfusion attributable to hemodynamic compromise and matched hypometabolism attributable to incomplete infarction. Type 3 but normal OEF may represent a transition stage from misery perfusion to matched hypometabolism.", 
    "125": "Imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-ones, imidazo[1,2-d][1,2,4]triazin-8-ones and imidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-8-ones are high affinity GABA(A) agonists. Compound 16d has good oral bioavailability in rat, functional selectivity for the GABA(A)alpha2 and alpha3-subtypes and is anxiolytic in a conditioned animal model of anxiety with minimal sedation observed at full BZ binding site occupancy.", 
    "126": "SE in the pediatric age group presents challenges in diagnosis and management. There is need for renewed consensus on the temporal definition of SE, both clinical and electrographic. SE in children exhibits an age-dependent vulnerability, with genetic predisposition and etiology as determinants of susceptibility. Nonepileptic phenomena may mimic SE. Clinical and electrographic SE in neonates are relatively rare, while serial (clinical and electrographic) and repetitive seizures are more common. Neurometabolic disease, chromosomal disorders, and abnormalities of cortical development are important etiological considerations. Abrupt discontinuation of or an aberrant response to AEDs can also precipitate SE. Metabolic perturbations and toxins can further aggravate the situation. Clinical and experimental data suggest that the longer a seizure lasts, the more difficult it becomes to control, and that seizures can have immediate and long-term adverse consequences on the immature and developing brain. Hence, treatment (usually with a benzodiazepine) should be started early in the clinical course. A trial of pyridoxine, biotin, or folinic acid should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting (e.g., neonates or young infants, in particular). Phenytoin/fosphenytoin and phenobarbital remain important treatment options. Pentobarbital and midazolam are preferred choices in the management of RSE. Once metabolic causes are excluded, children with RSE should be evaluated for surgical treatment early in the clinical course. Clinical guidelines based on best available evidence have to be periodically reviewed. The clinical consequences and management of electrographic SE, especially in the neonate, have to be addressed. Guidelines for continuous (video) EEG monitoring are needed to facilitate this task. AEDs that do not have an adverse effect on the developing brain have to be developed. Our review suggests a continuing need for prospective studies into all aspects of SE in the pediatric age group.", 
    "127": "Lorazepam (LZM) is a broadly used tranquillizer for the treatment of anxiety. Tavor is one of the most diffused registered drug products containing LZM. Lots of generic drug products containing LZM have been registered in Italy by several pharmaceutical groups and are present in the Italian market. Due to the wide medical prescription of products containing LZM, it seemed interesting, from a technological and biopharmaceutical point of view, to perform a comparative bioequivalence evaluation of a trade marked and generic tablet formulations containing LZM available in the Italian market.", 
    "128": "The trial vas carried out on four preparations, including Tavor (1 mg) as reference product and three generics named A, B and C. In vitro technological parameters (dissolution, uniformity of content, uniformity of weight) and in vivo (pharmacokinetic on rabbit) studies were performed.", 
    "129": "All the examined brands passed technological tests according the European Pharmacopeia 5th ed. and USP25. Tavor ensures a faster dissolution behaviour than the tree generics in vitro. All the pharmacokinetic parameters were within the prescriptions of EMEA, even if the reference product showed the highest values of AUC0-infinity and of Cmax.", 
    "130": "Obtained results show that Tavor ensures a faster dissolution behaviour than the tree generics in vitro. Moreover, considering the pharmacokinetic data, it is possible to suppose that the generics B and C are not able to provide the same therapeutic effect as the reference product.", 
    "131": "To determine the clinical sedative effect and dosage of intranasal midazolam in refraction and fundus examination of children with strabismus.", 
    "132": "Refraction and fundus examination with (n = 28) and without (n = 24) sedation were performed in 52 children with strabismus whose ages ranged from 7 to 26 months. We delivered a 5-mg/mL solution of midazolam via a syringe for 60 seconds to provide a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. We repeated the dose to a maximum of 0.3 mg/kg if there was no clinical sedative response after 10 to 15 minutes. The ease of examination and sedation for each patient was scored by a blinded observer. The groups were evaluated for ease of examination and the time needed to complete it.", 
    "133": "We obtained clinically adequate sedation at a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 15 minutes (+/- 2.69 minutes). Sedation was achieved with a mean dose of 2.64 mg/kg (+/- 0.66 mg/kg). Children receiving midazolam had significantly calmer examination scores. The time needed to complete the examination was statistically significantly shorter for these children than for children not receiving sedation (P < .05).", 
    "134": "Intranasal midazolam is a beneficial drug and method of delivery for the sedation of anxious children with strabismus undergoing refraction and fundus examination. Sedation prior to examination is effective in reducing the anxiety and time associated with ophthalmologic examination of children with strabismus.", 
    "135": "Benzodiazepine receptor ligands are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Accumulation of these ligands in brain was suggested to explain in part the notion of\"increased GABAergic tone,\" the rational for which arose initially from reports of a beneficial effect of the selective benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in HE patients. It was suggested on the basis of the effect of flumazenil in human HE that liver failure may result in alterations of the density and/or affinity of the benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptor site. Subsequent controlled-clinical trials showed that fumazenil had a transient beneficial effect in only a subpopulation of HE patients. In contrast to the antagonists, partial inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor have unequivocal beneficial effects on behavioral and electro-physiological performance in all experimental models of HE studied so far. Benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptors have consistently been demonstrated to be unaltered in both human and experimental HE. Contrary to initial reports, the so-called \"endogenous benzodiazepines\" do not appear to be significantly related to the pathogenesis of HE. On the other hand, nonbenzodiazepine GABA-A receptor complex modulators, such as neuro-steroids, recently identified in brain in human and experimental HE, may provide a new mechanistic basis for this disorder and lead to novel treatments for human HE.", 
    "136": "Hepatic encephalopathy is seen as a clinical manifestation of a chronic low grade cerebral edema, which is thought to trigger disturbances of astrocyte function, glioneuronal communication, and finally HE symptoms. In cultured astrocytes, hypoosmotic swelling triggers a rapid oxidative stress response, which involves the action of NADPH oxidase isoenzymes, followed by tyrosine nitration of distinct astrocytic proteins. Oxidative stress and protein tyrosine nitration (PTN) are also observed in response to ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha or interferons, and benzodiazepines with affinity to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). NMDA receptor activation was identified as upstream event in protein tyrosine nitration (PTN). Cerebral PTN is also found in vivo after administration of ammonia, benzodiazepines or lipopolysaccharide and in portocaval shunted rats. PTN predominantly affects astrocytes surrounding cerebral vessels with potential impact on blood-brain-barrier permeability. Among the tyrosine-nitrated proteins, glutamine synthetase, GAPDH, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the PBR were identified. PTN of glutamine synthetase is associated with inactivation of the enzyme. Thus, factors known to trigger hepatic encephalopathy induce oxidative/nitrosative stress on astrocytes with protein modifications through PTN. The pathobiochemical relevance of astrocytic PTN for the development of HE symptoms remains to be established.", 
    "137": "The amnestic effects of benzodiazepines are well documented on a variety of memory tasks. However, prospective memory (PM), or remembering to execute an action at a future time, has not been studied previously. This study examined the effect of diazepam on word list recall, PM, sustained attention, and subjective ratings of arousal. Forty-eight healthy participants, aged 19-35, received an average of 0.19 mg/kg oral diazepam or placebo in a double-blind manner. Retrospective memory and PM were assessed by free recall of unrelated word lists and by instructing participants to request a hidden belonging at the end of the session, respectively. Sustained attention was measured by multiple trials of a digit cancellation task, and subjective arousal was assessed by self-ratings of drowsiness. Diazepam impaired performance on all measures, including PM. Reduced PM performance was associated with decreased subjective arousal in the diazepam group but was unrelated to sustained attention. This is the first report of the effects of benzodiazepines on prospective remembering, and further supports the view that the arousal/attentional system is composed of partially independent subsystems that have differential relationships to memory.", 
    "138": "The experiments reported here demonstrated that corasol increased the extent of analgesia induced by stress and decreased the duration of immobility in mice in a forced swimming test in cold water. Administration of diazepam led to the opposite changes and counteracted the actions of the anxiogen. The effects of the anxiolytic were more apparent in NMRI than mongrel mice, while in mongrel mice the effects of the anxiogen were more marked. Changes in measures following administration of agents were reciprocal in nature. These results lead to the conclusion that that these changes are determined by the level of anxiety, and that the strain differences between mongrel and NMRI mice are also linked with this factor.", 
    "139": "Hypertonia, which results from motor pathway defects in the central nervous system (CNS), is observed in numerous neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, stiff-person syndrome, spastic paraplegia, dystonia and Parkinson disease. Mice with mutation in the hypertonic (hyrt) gene exhibit severe hypertonia as their primary symptom. Here we show that hyrt mutant mice have much lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors in their CNS, particularly the lower motor neurons, than do wild-type mice, indicating that the hypertonicity of the mutants is likely to be caused by deficits in GABA-mediated motor neuron inhibition. We cloned the responsible gene, trafficking protein, kinesin binding 1 (Trak1), and showed that its protein product interacts with GABA(A) receptors. Our data implicate Trak1 as a crucial regulator of GABA(A) receptor homeostasis and underscore the importance of hyrt mice as a model for studying the molecular etiology of hypertonia associated with human neurological diseases.", 
    "140": "Altered regional cerebral blood flow (r-CBF) is mentioned as one of possible etiological factors or as a consequence of schizophrenia. Perfusion scintigraphic brain studies with SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) can detect areas of the brain with altered perfusion during the disease. Conflicting data exist on follow-up after treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate r-CBF in acute first-episode schizophrenia and early effect of antipsychotic drugs on r-CBF.", 
    "141": "Clinical criteria for schizophrenia were met according to International Classification of Diseases-10th Edition (ICD-10). Psychic status and severity of the disease in each patient were evaluated with psychiatric interview, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) on the same day as the scintigraphic study. Brain perfusion SPECT was performed 20 minutes after 99mTc-ECD application. R-CBF was measured in 9 first-episode schizophrenic male patients 2-7 (median 6) days after the beginning of antipsychotic treatment and 8-15 (median 9) weeks later. Semiquantitative analysis of r-CBF was performed with cerebellum as the reference region. R-CBF was evaluated for 12 regions in each study.", 
    "142": "Decrease in perfusion in comparison to cerebellum was detected in left (90%) and right (93%) frontal lobes. Increase in perfusion between the first (t1) and the second (t2) investigation was significant (p<0.05) for both frontal regions (left 94%, right 97%). Significant decrease in PANSS (p<0.05) and CGI (p<0.001) scores was noted and correlated well with the increase of r-CBF.", 
    "143": "Our findings implicate that patients with first-episode schizophrenia have significant left hypoperfusion relative to the right in dorsolateral frontal lobes. Increased blood flow was observed bilaterally in dorsolateral frontal lobes after 10 weeks of antipsychotic medication. Significant amelioration of r-CBF correlated with clinical improvement.", 
    "144": "Most clinicians tend to believe that the occurrence of the anxiety disorder in comorbidity with a personality disorder often leads to longer treatment, worsens the prognosis, and thus increasing treatment costs. The study is designed to compare the short-term effectiveness of combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy in patient suffering with panic disorder with and without personality disorder.", 
    "145": "We compare the efficacy of 6th week therapeutic program and 6th week follow up in patients suffering with panic disorder and/or agoraphobia and comorbid personality disorder (29 patients) and panic disorder and/or agoraphobia without comorbid personality disorder (31 patients). Diagnosis was done according to the ICD-10 research diagnostic criteria confirmed with MINI and support with psychological methods: IPDE, MCMI-III and TCI. Patients were treated with CBT and psychopharmacs. They were regularly assessed in week 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 by an independent reviewer on the CGI (Clinical Global Improvement) for severity and change, PDSS (Panic Disorder Severity Scale), HAMA (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), SDS (Sheehan Disability Scale), HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), and in self-assessments BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and BDI (Beck Depression Inventory).",

The 12th week treatment efficacy in the patients with panic disorder without personality disorder had been showed significantly better compared with the group with panic disorder comorbid with personality disorder in CGI and specific inventory for panic disorder--PDSS. Also the scores in depression inventories HDRS and BDI showed significantly higher decrease during the treatment comparing with group without personality disorder. But the treatment effect between groups did not differ in objective anxiety scale HAMA, and subjective anxiety scale BAI.", 
    "147": "A 16-year-old girl, who carried a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, presented with symptoms consistent with excited catatonia/delirious mania. We believe this is the first report of excited catatonia in a child under the age of 18. Her catatonic symptoms responded to low-dose oral lorazepam (higher doses led to worsening of her clinical status). This case highlights the importance of considering catatonia in the differential diagnosis of agitated delirium, even in pediatric populations, and it underscores the need for more data about the pathogenesis and treatment of catatonia.", 
    "148": "Although the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine is increasingly being used in child and adolescent psychiatry, reports of olanzapine overdose in this young population are scarce. We report on two cases of adolescents who attempted suicide with an overdose of olanzapine: (1) A 14-year-old female ingested 275 mg olanzapine, which produced the highest reported nonlethal serum level (1503 ng/mL) and caused somnolence, agitation (acutely), and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS; after 54 hours) but no major clinical complications. The serum olanzapine level dropped to 129 ng/mL within 48 hours; and (2) a 17-year-old male ingested 400 mg olanzapine, the highest reported nonlethal dose of olanzapine in adolescents, which produced respiratory suppression requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation; he recovered after 3 days. Based on clinical monitoring and postmortem data, the 2 patients survived the ingestion of high doses of olanzapine. We also provide a review of the literature, encompassing all reported cases of olanzapine overdose in children and adolescents and discuss symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options, based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations.", 
    "149": "The use of atypical antipsychotics is increasing in adolescent populations, but little is known about adherence with these treatments. This study examined postdischarge adherence of adolescents treated as inpatients with either olanzapine or risperidone.", 
    "150": "Eighty-six (86) adolescent inpatients (43 per treatment) were contacted an average of 10 months (range, 90 days to 18 months) after discharge from the hospital. A structured interview examined compliance, side effects, and subjective impressions regarding the efficacy of treatment. Clinical symptoms rated by clinicians, self-reports from patients, hospital chart diagnosis, treatment group (risperidone/olanzapine), and demographic factors were used to predict compliance, as were the occurrence of side effects and subjective impressions of the efficacy of treatment.", 
    "151": "Forty-five percent (45%) of the patients were adherent with their medications, while only 12% discontinued treatment on their own, and 43% stopped medication at the request of their parent or a physician. Medication status and symptom severity did not predict nonadherence, and the only diagnosis related to adherence was substance abuse. The only side effect that predicted nonadherence was rapid weight gain during the hospitalization; this was slightly more common in olanzapine-treated patients. Nonadherent patients' subjective impressions of efficacy were no different from the patients who continued their medications, but the patients who stopped medication on their own were more likely to also have failed to attend recommended psychotherapy as well.", 
    "152": "Failure to continue recommended treatment with atypical antipsychotics was most common in cases who did not comply with other aspects of the discharge plan. Efficacy of the medication did not predict nonadherence, as half of the noncompliant subjects stated that the medication had been helpful. Rapid weight gain also predicted nonadherence, but subjective impression of long-term weight gain was not different across adherence or treatment status. These data tentatively suggest that in adolescent patients, tendencies toward general uncooperativeness and substance abuse may be at least as important as the occurrence of common side effects in the determination of medication adherence.", 
    "153": "Decreased bone mineral density defines osteoporosis according to the World Health Organization and is an important predictor of future fractures. The use of several types of central nervous system-active drugs, including benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and opioids, have all been associated with increased risk of fracture. However, it is unclear whether such an increase in risk is related to an effect of bone mineral density or to other factors, such as increased risk of falls. We sought to examine the relationship between bone mineral density and the use of benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and opioids in a representative US population-based sample.", 
    "154": "We analyzed data on adults aged 17 years and older from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994). Total femoral bone mineral density of 7114 male and 7532 female participants was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Multivariable linear regression models were used to quantify the relation between central nervous system medication exposure and total femoral bone mineral density. Models controlled for relevant covariates, including age, sex, and body mass index.", 
    "155": "In linear regression models, significantly reduced bone mineral density was found in subjects taking anticonvulsants (0.92 g/cm2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89 to 0.94) and opioids (0.92 g/cm2; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.95) compared with nonusers (0.95 g/cm2; 95% CI: 0.95 to 0.95) after adjusting for several potential confounders. The other central nervous system-active drugs--benzodiazepines or antidepressants--were not associated with significantly reduced bone mineral density.", 
    "156": "In cross-sectional analysis of NHANES III, anticonvulsants and opioids (but not benzodiazepines or antidepressants) were associated with significantly reduced bone mineral density. These findings have implications for fracture-prevention strategies.", 
    "157": "Triazolam was analyzed from human plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with an MSpak GF polymer column (50 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., particle size 6 microm), which enabled direct injection of crude biological samples. Separation of triazolam, and lorazepam as the internal standard (IS) was carried out using 10mM ammonium acetate (pH 3.56)-0.1% formic acid and an acetonitrile gradient elution. Both compounds formed base peaks due to [M + H]+ ions by HPLC/ESI-MS, and product ions were produced from each [M + H]+ ion as seen by HPLC-MS/MS. Quantification of triazolam and the IS in plasma samples was made by selective reaction monitoring using each base peak of product ions of HPLC-MS/MS. The recovery range of triazolam spiked into plasma was 86.4-92.7%. The regression equation for triazolam showed excellent linearity in the range of 0.25-20 ng/mL, and the detection limit was 0.1 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precisions for triazolam in plasma samples were not greater than 12.4%. Accuracy for the drug was in the range of 88.0-101.4%. Data obtained after oral administration of triazolam in male and female subjects are also presented.", 
    "158": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tool for qualitative evaluation of nucleic acid expression. PCR has been widely applied to measure DNA and RNA messages expression. Neurosteroids synthesized in the nervous system are potent modulators of synaptic activity and have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. To examine the possibility of an altered expression of the neurosteroidogenic metabolic enzymes in neurological diseases (like Parkinson's disease, PD) we developed a comparative non-radioactive RT-PCR assay to detect the mRNA levels of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, the 5alpha-reductase type 1 and 3alpha-hydroxysteroid-oxidoreductase type 1 and 2 in lymphocytes obtained from PD patients. The results were compared with that obtained from simultaneous quantification of progesterone, 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone and 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone in the plasma and cerebro-spinal fluid of the same individuals using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique. We found a significant decrease of the rate-limiting enzyme 5alpha-R1 along with a significant decrease in plasma and CSF of the 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone and of the 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone. Comparative RT-PCR assay, along with complimentary techniques (i.e. GC/MS), has the sensitivity, selectivity and dynamic range to allow specific and reliable quantization of the enzymes involved in the neurosteroids pathway and represent a valuable tool to assess their expression in human neuropsychiatric conditions.", 
    "159": "Conflict procedures are used to study mechanisms underlying the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines (BZs). We established a conflict procedure with rhesus monkeys in order to examine the role of GABAA receptors in the anxiolytic-like effects of BZs.", 
    "160": "Four rhesus monkeys responded under a two-component multiple schedule in which responding was maintained under a fixed-ratio schedule of food delivery in the absence (non-suppressed responding) and presence (suppressed responding) of response-contingent electric shock.", 
    "161": "Conventional BZs (alprazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam, bromazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide) engendered increases in the average rates of suppressed responding at low to intermediate doses and decreased the average rates of non-suppressed responding at higher doses. Positive correlations were observed when the therapeutic potencies of BZs in humans were compared with potencies to increase the rates of suppressed responding (R2=0.83) or decrease the rates of non-suppressed responding (R2=0.60). The 5-HT1A agonist buspirone increased the rates of suppressed responding, although the effects were modest, whereas the opioid morphine lacked anti-conflict effects. The BZ antagonist flumazenil also modestly increased the rates of suppressed responding. A relatively low dose of flumazenil enhanced, while a high dose blocked, alprazolam's anti-conflict effects. Compounds selective for alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors (zolpidem, zaleplon, CL218,872) engendered relatively weak increases in the rates of suppressed responding.", 
    "162": "A rhesus monkey conflict procedure was established with predictive validity for therapeutic doses in people and provided evidence that anxiolytic-like effects of BZs can occur with relatively low intrinsic efficacy at GABAA receptors and are reduced by alpha1GABAA receptor selectivity.", 
    "163": "Characterization of anxiolytic drugs often employs conflict paradigms in which the drug effects on punished and unpunished responding can be compared. In this study, a fixed interval schedule generating a range of baseline response rates allowed comparison of the effects of anxiolytic drugs with those of psychotomimetic drugs on equivalent and differing rates of punished and unpunished responding. The first response made by the rat after a 40-s fixed interval elapsed resulted in food pellet delivery. In punished intervals, signalled by the illumination of stimulus lamps above each lever, a 0.6-mA shock was delivered after every 20th response, resulting in a lower rate of responding than that in the unpunished intervals. Three psychotomimetic agents, D-amphetamine, MK801 and DOI were compared with the anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide, NS2710 and pregabalin. The three psychotomimetics preferentially increased rates of unpunished responding compared with those of punished responding. Chlordiazepoxide, NS2710 and, to a lesser extent, pregabalin increased rates of both unpunished and punished responding. In comparison studies, yohimbine also increased rates of both unpunished and punished responding whereas the antidepressant citalopram had no effect. In conclusion, stable baseline performance over many months allowed the direct comparison of several different drugs in the same subjects with no need to adjust shock levels or equate baseline response rates. The drugs had systematic and replicable effects in this procedure, which, in the case of amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide, were similar to those in other species, and psychotomimetic drugs could clearly be distinguished from anxiolytic drugs. The procedure, however, has limited value for characterizing novel anxiolytic agents as the examples used here increased punished and unpunished responding to the same extent, and were indistinguishable in that regard from the clinically anxiogenic agent, yohimbine.", 
    "164": "The elevated plus-maze is a widely employed behavioural assay for anxiolytic and anxiogenic agents in rodents. Among laboratories, however, the apparatus often differs between the use of transparent and opaque walls. This inconsistency may represent an unnecessary confound in the literature when comparing results. Here, we directly contrasted the two designs with respect to (1) mouse strain differences (C57BL/6, 129/Sv, and C3H/He) and (2) sensitivity to diazepam (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Both mazes yielded similar results indicating that 129/Sv mice were more anxious than C57BL/6 or C3H mice, with the transparent elevated plus-maze tending to encourage open-arm exploration in all three strains. Next, we examined the effect of diazepam in the 129/Sv strain across the two mazes. Systemic diazepam at 1.5 mg/kg led to increased percentage time spent in the open arms in both elevated plus-mazes; the drug was ineffective in both elevated plus-mazes at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Although our results revealed little practical difference between the two mazes in terms of their ability to detect differences in anxiety-related behaviour, the baseline difference in open-arm exploration between the two elevated plus-mazes suggests that the transparent design may be more congenial for the detection of anxiogenic manipulations, and the opaque maze for anxiolytic manipulations.", 
    "165": "The activity of the novel antidepressant agomelatine was evaluated in three models of anxiety and compared with that of melatonin and two anxiolytics, diazepam and buspirone. All drugs were tested 2 h before and 2 h after the dark phase of the diurnal cycle. Morning and evening agomelatine (10-75 mg/kg) administration increased animals' responses in the elevated plus maze and Vogel tests. Melatonin (10-75 mg/kg) enhanced open arms exploration in the evening experiment and was inactive in the Vogel test. In the conditioned ultrasonic vocalization test, agomelatine, but not melatonin, was active in the morning and evening experiment. Melatonin antagonist, S22153 (20 mg/kg), enhanced the action of morning and evening agomelatine administration in the Vogel and conditioned ultrasonic vocalization tests, while in the elevated plus maze test, S22153 inhibited effects of evening but not morning melatonin and agomelatine administration. These results indicate the involvement of both the melatonin and the 5-HT2C receptors in the mechanism of anxiolytic-like action of agomelatine.", 
    "166": "Inflammatory reaction is very important for formation of the neomembrane of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH). The present study evaluated medical treatment with the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, etizolam, for the resolution of CSDH, and the factors indicating surgery or conservative therapy. Alternate patients were assigned to the etizolam group or control group without medical treatment. Patients in the etizolam group received 3.0 mg etizolam per day for 14 days. A total of 53 patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Univariate analysis of differences in demographic characteristics, clinical findings, and initial computed tomography (CT) findings, and multiple logistic regression analysis of the relationship between etizolam treatment and requirement for surgery using age, sex, low density of hematoma on CT, and paresis as confounders were performed. Etizolam treatment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.156, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.024-0.999, p = 0.049) was negatively correlated with requirement for surgery. Low density of hematoma (adjusted OR 0.125, 95% CI 0.019-0.846, p = 0.033) was found to be an independent negative predictor, and paresis as an initial symptom (adjusted OR 6.35, 95% CI 1.04-38.7, p = 0.045) was an independent positive predictor of requirement for surgery. Etizolam administration can promote the resolution of CSDH, especially at the stage of hygroma appearing as low density on CT. Surgery is recommended if the patient presents with paresis.", 
    "167": "The connection between smoking and depression, the antidepressant actions of nicotine and the targeting of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by monoamine re-uptake inhibitors all point to a potential role of nAChRs in the etiology and/or symptomatology of depression. In the current study, we evaluated nAChR subtypes in brain regions of rats subjected to olfactory bulbectomy (OBX), a standard animal model that recapitulates many of the behavioral and neurochemical alterations thought to underlie human depression. Comparisons were made both to sham-operated controls and unoperated animals. OBX led to upregulation of cerebrocortical alpha4beta2 nAChRs and downregulation of striatal alpha7 nAChRs as compared to either the sham-operated or unoperated groups. Striatal alpha4beta2 nAChRs were also downregulated but the sham surgery by itself produced a partial effect, masking the contribution of the OBX lesion. In agreement with earlier studies, we also found downregulation of muscarinic AChRs (both m1 and m2 subtypes) in the striatum when comparing the OBX group to sham-operated controls, but because sham surgery evoked mAChR upregulation, the effect was not apparent when the OBX animals were contrasted to the unoperated group. Accordingly, caution needs to be exercised in interpreting studies of cholinergic function in the OBX model that do not include unoperated animals as an additional comparison group. Our results reinforce a relationship between depression and nAChR expression and point to the need for parallel studies in human depression that might lead to the design of novel therapies targeting specific nAChR subtypes.", 
    "168": "The neuroprotective effect of talampanel, a negative allosteric modulator of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-4-isoxazolyl-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors has been described previously. However, in these studies the histological changes and not the functional consequences of the brain damage were evaluated. The aim of present investigation was to analyze the sensorimotor function after stroke and to test the influence of talampanel (GYKI-53773, LY-300164) by 30-day monitoring in rats. After 1h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) general 'well-being', neurological status, spontaneous motor activity, rotation, motor coordination, balancing, muscle strength and reaction time were followed for 1 month. Talampanel (6 x 10 mg/kg i.p. given on the day of stroke) improved the motor coordination in rotarod (p < 0.01) and beam walking (p < 0.01) tests, reduced the number of stroke-induced rotations (p < 0.05), shortened the reflex time on the forelimb contralateral to brain ischemia and improved the survival rate comparing with vehicle treated control. After stroke, serious sensorimotor deficits appeared in rats but they showed partial spontaneous recovery after 30 days. Talampanel treatment enhanced the rate of functional improvement without changing the morphology at the end of the experiment. Our results indicate that modulation of AMPA receptors by talampanel can be a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of stroke.", 
    "169": "Intravenous benzodiazepines in combination with opiates are used to achieve moderate sedation for colonoscopy. Although effective, these agents have potential adverse effects, such as respiratory depression and hypotension. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride possesses central nervous system depressant effects that theoretically could provide a synergistic effect for sedating patients.", 
    "170": "The objective was to assess the efficacy of adding diphenhydramine hydrochloride as an adjunct to improve sedation and to reduce the amount of standard sedatives used during colonoscopy.", 
    "171": "We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.", 
    "172": "The study was conducted in a university hospital with an active GI fellowship training program.", 
    "173": "The study group comprised 270 patients undergoing screening/diagnostic/therapeutic colonoscopy were enrolled.", 
    "174": "Patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg of diphenhydramine or placebo, given intravenously 3 minutes before starting conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam and meperidine.", 
    "175": "The main outcome measure was anesthetic effect as assessed by the endoscopy team and by the patient; quantity of adjunctive sedatives to achieve adequate sedation.", 
    "176": "Of 270 patients, data were analyzed for 258 patients, with 130 patients in the diphenhydramine group and 128 patients in the placebo group. There was a 10.1% reduction in meperidine usage and 13.7% reduction in midazolam usage in favor of the diphenhydramine group. The mean evaluation scores as judged by the faculty, the fellows, and the nurses were statistically significant in favor of the diphenhydramine group. In addition, patient scores for overall sedation and pain level favored the group that received diphenhydramine.", 
    "177": "Intravenous diphenhydramine given before initiation of standard sedation offers a significant benefit to conscious sedation for patients undergoing colonoscopy.", 
    "178": "Glutamate- and GABA-releasing neurons form the basis for neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The co-ordination of these excitatory and inhibitory systems, together with intrinsic voltage-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptor modulation, provides the diverse neuronal firing patterns, network activity and synaptic plasticity that are required for the complexity of CNS function. Virtually all of the known molecular components of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter systems have been considered as potential therapeutic targets. Positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors, such as the benzodiazepines, have found wide clinical use, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists ketamine and memantine have therapeutic utility. In these fundamental neurotransmitter systems, drugs that provide allosteric modulation of ligand-gated ion channels or G-protein-coupled receptors, or seek to selectively target receptor subtypes, appear to hold the greatest promise for the desired balance of efficacy and tolerability. This might also be achieved through targeting transporter subtypes. A large number of compounds based on these strategies are currently in clinical trials for diseases that span a wide range of CNS disorders.", 
    "179": "Benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and barbiturates are commonly used for sedation to achieve symptom control in end-of-life care. Propofol has several advantages over traditional sedating agents that would indicate its use in treatment-refractory situations. We report on the use of propofol in 35 patients. In 22 patients, propofol was used for palliative sedation when treatment with benzodiazepines had failed. The mean dose range during treatment was between 0.90 and 2.13 mg/kg/h. The effect was assessed as good or very good in 91% of the patients. Thirteen patients were treated with propofol due to intractable nausea and vomiting. The mean dose range during the infusion period was 0.67-1.01 mg/kg/h. The effect was judged as good or very good in 69% of the patients. Based on our experience, we propose clinical guidelines on the safe use of propofol in specialized palliative inpatient units.", 
    "180": "The anxiolytic potential of melatonin and agomelatine, a potent MT(1/2) receptor agonist, and their combined effects with diazepam, were investigated in rats using the punished drinking test, the safety signal withdrawal operant paradigm, the elevated-plus-maze and hypophagia-induced novelty. In the punished drinking test, evening injections of melatonin (80 mg/kg, IP, but not 20 and 40 mg/kg) and agomelatine (40 mg/kg, IP) increased the number of foot shocks received. However, neither melatonin (40-80 mg/kg) nor agomelatine (20-40 mg/kg) released response suppression during the period associated with the safety signal withdrawal and affected rats' behaviour in the elevated-plus-maze. Furthermore, agomelatine (40 mg/kg) did not enhance food consumption in unfamiliar environment. However, the co-administration of melatonin (80 mg/kg) or agomelatine (20-40 mg/kg) with diazepam, at a dose (0.25 mg/kg) inactive on its own, induced an anxiolytic-like effect in the punished drinking test and the elevated plus-maze. These results indicate that, although mostly devoid of anxiolytic-like action per se, melatonin and agomelatine can potentiate the anxiolytic effects of diazepam.", 
    "181": "Fetal exposure to diazepam (DZ), a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptors and an agonist at mitochondrial benzodiazine receptors, induces long-term neural and behavioral effects. This study evaluated whether the early manipulation influenced the normal development of brain levels of neurosteroids or altered steroid action at GABA(A) receptors. Pregnant dams were injected over gestation days 14 through 20 with DZ (2.5 mg/kg) or the vehicle. Male and female offspring were analyzed at five postnatal ages. The levels of progesterone (P), dihydroprogesterone (DHP), 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone, and 5alpha-androstan-3alpha,17beta diol were measured in the cerebral cortex and diencephalon. The results indicated that development of brain steroid levels and the impact of fetal DZ exposure were region- and sex-specific. Age-related changes in brain steroids did not mirror associated changes in circulating P and T. Age regulated the levels of all 3 progestins in the cerebral cortex, and fetal DZ exposure interacted with the development of P and DHP. The development of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the cortex was markedly influenced by sex, with levels in males decreasing over postnatal development whereas they increased over postpubertal development in females. An adolescent surge in T levels was observed in male cortex and fetal DZ exposure prevented that surge. Steroid levels in the diencephalon were altered by age mainly in females, and DZ exposure had little effect in this region. The data support region-specific regulation of brain steroid synthesis. Only in the cerebral cortex are relevant mechanisms readily modifiable by fetal DZ exposure. However, neither sex nor fetal DZ exposure altered the response of GABA(A) receptors in adult cortex to neurosteroid.", 
    "182": "A previous study by us indicated that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) density may be increased in the ovaries and uterus of pregnant rats (Weizman R, Dagan E, Snyder SH, Gavish M. Impact of pregnancy and lactation on GABAA receptor and central-type and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. Brain Res 1997;752:7-14). In the present study, the effects of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) on PBR density in the ovary and uterus of pseudopregnant rats were assayed. Pseudopregnancy was induced on day 29 post-partum (PP) by s.c. injection of 50IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 3 days later by s.c. injection of 20IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). PBR ligand binding density was assayed with the specific PBR ligand [3H]PK 11195. A two-fold increase in ovarian PBR density was observed 2 days after hCG administration compared with vehicle control rats and this effect was maintained for 3 weeks. In the uterus, a three-fold increase in PBR density was observed and this increase was maintained for 1 week after hCG administration. Pseudopregnancy did not appear to affect renal PBR density or affinity. Treatment with PGF2alpha, which causes luteolysis, resulted in an approximately 50% reduction of PBR density in the ovaries of pseudopregnant rats at day 53 PP compared to pseudopregnant control rats. Treatment with indomethacin, which prevents the formation of PGF2alpha, caused the PBR density in the uterus of pseudopregnant rats at day 53 PP to be twice as high as in pseudopregnant control rats. All the above treatments did not affect the affinity of [3H]PK 11195 to ovarian and uterine PBR. These data suggest that PBR density in corpora lutea and uterus during pseudopregnancy is regulated by PGF2alpha."
