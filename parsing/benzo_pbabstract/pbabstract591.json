    "0": "According to pharmacological data as well as to clinical experience a potential of benzodiazepines for producing dependence is not a matter of doubt. However, when compared to the dependence liability of barbiturates the corresponding effect of benzodiazepines is low. In evaluating the dependence potential of benzediazepines account must be taken of the rareness of psychotropic effects of these substances and of the absence of usual mechanisms of tolerance, as well as the epidemiology of psychosomatic syndromes and their treatment outcome. The paper summarizes different types of clinical approaches to evaluating the abuse and dependence liability. In relation to the high incidence of prescriptions for benzodiazepines, the incidence of dependence syndromes is low, but with a wide range of degrees and patterns of such syndromes. Mostly autonomic and psychic symptoms, occasionally grand mal seizures and sensory disturbances and very rarely psychotic symptoms have been described. While the time course differs there is, in comparison to barbiturates, a shift in onset and duration of symptoms.", 
    "1": "A study of the disposition and metabolism of premazepam, 3,7-dihydro-5-phenyl-6,7-dimethyl-pyrrole[3,4-e][1,4]diazepin-2-(1 H) -one, a new anti-anxiety agent, was carried out in rats and dogs given the 14C-labeled compound iv and po. In both species, after oral administration, both total radioactivity and the unchanged drug are rapidly absorbed and peak plasma levels are reached within 0.5-1 hr in rats and 2 hr in dogs. Unchanged premazepam is cleared faster in rats than in dogs, with half-lives about 1.7 and 2.7 hr, respectively. Following oral dosage, two-thirds of the dose is eliminated in urine. From the urine of the two species, eight metabolites and unchanged premazepam were identified. N-7-Desmethyl premazepam (l) is the major metabolite in rat urine (18% of the dose) but is not present in dog urine, while 6-hydroxymethyl premazepam is the most abundant metabolite in dog urine (25% of the dose) but is absent in rat urine. Metabolites III and IV from rat and dog urine are stable derivatives of the intermediate formed by the cleavage of the imine bond of the diazepine ring. A successive hydrolysis of the amidic bond of the same intermediate originates metabolites V-VIII, which are quantitatively minor ones.", 
    "2": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 200 patients with moderate to moderately severe anxiety we compared the anxiolytic efficacy and safety of alprazolam and lorazepam. Dosing was flexible and ranged from 1 to 4.5 mg/day of alprazolam and from 2 to 9 mg/day of lorazepam. The mean daily dose at the end of the 16 week study was alprazolam 3.3 mg and lorazepam 5.1 mg. Both active drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in relieving the symptoms of anxiety on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, with a trend toward more improvement in the alprazolam group in the later weeks of the study. Target Symptoms, Physician's and Patient's Global Impressions and the Self Rating Symptom Scale indicate that alprazolam and lorazepam were superior to placebo. The major side effects were sedation and drowsiness; the frequency was similar for alprazolam and lorazepam and twice as high for active drug as placebo. An overall rating of side effect severity was not significantly different among the three groups.", 
    "3": "The possible kinetic interaction of the hypnotic temazepam and the H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine was evaluated. Nine healthy male and female volunteers received a 30-mg oral dose of temazepam on two occasions in random sequence, separated by at least 1 week. On one occasion, temazepam was given in the otherwise drug-free state; on the other, temazepam was given with concurrent administration of cimetidine, 300 mg every 6 h. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for temazepam in control versus cimetidine trials were: peak plasma concentration, 560 versus 498 ng/mL; time of peak concentration, 2.0 versus 2.1 h after the dose; volume of distribution, 1.30 versus 1.39 L/kg; elimination half-life, 9.9 versus 11.4 h; total clearance, 1.59 versus 1.60 mL/min/kg; free fraction of temazepam in plasma, 4.1 versus 3.8% unbound. Cimetidine has been shown to reduce the metabolic clearance of the benzodiazepines that are biotransformed by oxidative mechanisms. Temazepam, transformed by conjugation, appears unaffected by the coadministration of cimetidine.", 
    "4": "12 obese patients, pair-matched with 12 normal subjects, received a single 1 mg oral dose of alprazolam. Nine similar subject pairs received a single 0.5 mg oral dose of triazolam. Oral volume of distribution (Vd) was much greater in obese than control subjects for alprazolam (mean 114 vs 73L, p less than 0.001), but there was no difference between the 2 groups for triazolam (117 vs 116L). Apparent oral clearance (not corrected for body weight) of alprazolam was lower, although not significantly so, in obesity (66 vs 88 ml/min), but for triazolam it was much lower in the obese (340 vs 531 ml/min, p less than 0.005). Elimination half-life, which is dependent on both Vd and clearance, was prolonged in obesity for alprazolam (22 vs 11h, p less than 0.001) due to the increase in Vd, and also for triazolam (4.1 vs 2.6 h, p less than 0.025) because of the decreased clearance. Plasma protein binding was unchanged in obese compared with control subjects for both alprazolam and triazolam. During long term administration alprazolam should therefore take longer to reach steady-state concentrations in obese patients but the final levels achieved should be no different than for patients of normal bodyweight, provided dosage is adjusted for ideal rather than total bodyweight. In contrast, triazolam has impaired clearance in obesity. However, if given once-daily it still would not accumulate with long term dosing due to its short half-life relative to the interval between doses.", 
    "5": "There is an increasing need for sensitive and specific methods for toxicological screening. Development of a dual-column gas chromatography system for the screening of drugs and metabolites in the plasma of poisoned patients is described. The system has been evaluated using plasma from a well-documented series of patients presenting with overdose, and results obtained have been compared with results of specific assays for the groups of drugs encountered. The method has been found to be of value in the treatment of poisoned patients despite its apparent insensitivity to certain more polar drug metabolites such as nortriptyline and desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "6": "Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines (PZP) have been reported to be specific anxiolytic agents which do not potentiate ethanol or barbiturates. To further investigate these compounds, three of the most promising analogs were synthesized and a tritium-labeled analog of one of them prepared by a new synthetic procedure. These analogs did not compete with [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]beta-carboline ethyl ester binding nor did they potentiate the [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Receptor binding studies with the [3H]PZP revealed a low affinity receptor site, distinct from that of the benzodiazepines, but with only a small fraction (20%) of specific binding. Behavioral tests using three different animal models for anxiety: muricide, approach/avoidance conflict and two-chamber exploration tests gave conflicting results, positive in the first and negative in the latter two. Furthermore, these compounds were found not to be antagonists of diazepam's anticonvulsant activity. Taken together, these results, while provocative, do not support evidence that these analogs are promising specific anxiolytic agents.", 
    "7": "The effect of patient recognition of tranquilizing agents on patient requests for tranquilizers during detoxification treatment was evaluated. A total of 120 subjects, all patients at a detoxification unit, were randomly assigned to four groups: diazepam 10 mg in its commercially available form, diazepam 10 mg masked in opaque capsules, hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg in its commercially available form, and hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg masked in opaque capsules. Tranquilizers were administered only on patient request, and the time and date of each request were recorded. Subjects were interviewed about previous tranquilizer use and recognition of tranquilizing agents. They also completed a state-trait anxiety inventory. Patient records were reviewed to obtain basic demographic data. Although requests and recognition were higher in those subjects in the diazepam groups, the differences between the two groups were not significant. However, there was a positive relationship between requests for diazepam among those who recognized their medications, and administering the medications in opaque capsules significantly reduced the number of requests for both drugs. Anxiety scores and previous drug therapy were found to be significantly related to recognition and the average number of requests. There was a positive relationship between recognition of and requests for a tranquilizer. Clinicians should consider giving patients with a tendency to abuse drugs nonidentifiable dosage forms.", 
    "8": "A double-blind crossover study compared the hypnotic effect, daytime carryover, and safety of triazolam 0.5 mg, lorazepam 2 mg, and placebo. The two active drugs were similar in hypnotic effect and superior to placebo. Patients reported more drowsiness upon awakening and more sleepiness in mid-morning and mid-afternoon after nights on lorazepam than nights on triazolam or placebo. The most common side effects--drowsiness, lightheadedness, restlessness, impaired coordination, dizziness, and nausea--were reported three times as often with lorazepam than with triazolam or placebo.", 
    "9": "A survey at a teaching hospital found that 46% of medical patients had prescriptions written specifically for sleep and 31% received a hypnotic agent at least once during hospitalization. Physicians for 96% of surgical patients ordered hypnotic agents and 88% received such a drug. The rationale for prescribing hypnotic agents was not well documented. Administration did not correlate with requests by patients, with previous use of hypnotic agents, or with recorded indications of sleep disturbance; however, the chance of receiving a hypnotic agent was greater if the patient was on a private instead of a ward service and if nurses were more inclined to fill as-needed prescriptions. Patients who received a hypnotic agent did not rate the quality of their sleep as being any better than those who did not, and they complained of as many awakenings during the night. Further studies are necessary to ascertain the indications and efficacy of hypnotic agents for hospitalized patients.", 
    "10": "In hospitalized patients, the commonest causes of acute insomnia are the effects of illness, environmental sleep disruption, medication, anxiety, and depression. Treatment should correct underlying medical disorders; reduce environmental sleep disruptions; and lower anxiety with psychological interventions, sedative or hypnotic medication, and relaxation training. Special clinical problems include chronic pain, delirium, and insomnia in the elderly.", 
    "11": "Several opioid antagonists have previously been shown to decrease drinking. The data have suggested that this was due to an antagonist action at kappa opioid receptors rather than mu or delta opioid receptors. Kappa agonists have a marked diuretic effect through suppression of vasopressin release. Antagonism of this kappa receptor-mediated effect can be used as an in vivo test for determining kappa-receptor antagonist activity. The potencies of opioid antagonists for antagonizing the diuretic effects of the kappa agonist bremazocine do not correlate directly with the potencies for decreasing deprivation-induced drinking. Further work should investigate the receptor specificity for effects on drinking and kappa-mediated diuresis.", 
    "12": "The stable derivatives of adenosine, 2-chloroadenosine and N6-cyclohexyladenosine, with high affinity for the A1 (Ri) adenosine receptor, suppress the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal contracture of the opiate-dependent guinea-pig ileum in vitro. These adenosine derivatives also inhibit naloxone-precipitated jumping, diarrhea and weight-loss in morphine-dependent mice. This effect was not due to sedation, since (i) 2-chloroadenosine was effective at a non-sedative dose and (ii) sedative doses of chlordiazepoxide were ineffective.", 
    "13": "The specific binding of both the non-classical antagonist [3H] pirenzepine ( [3H]PZ) and the classical antagonist [3H](-)quinuclidinyl benzilate ( [3H](-)QNB) was determined in parallel assays of the mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid cell line (NG 108-15). Saturation isotherms yielded a Kd = 4.0 nM and Bmax = 27.8 fmoles/mg protein for [3H]PZ and a Kd = 17.2 pM and Bmax = 53.2 fmoles/mg protein for [3H](-)QNB. The inhibition data of pirenzepine vs [3H](-)QNB was best fit to a 2-site binding model revealing both a high affinity pirenzepine site (72%, KH = 10.3 nM) and a low affinity site (28%, KL = 97.5 nM). [3H]PZ competition studies demonstrated stereospecificity, steep inhibition curves for muscarinic antagonists (Hill coefficients close to 1), and a shallow inhibition curve for a muscarinic agonist. These results indicate that muscarinic receptors on NG 108-15 cells may be subclassified (M1/M2) on the basis of the discriminative capability of [3H]PZ.", 
    "14": "The high affinity binding of the muscarinic ligand 3H-N-methylscopolamine (3H-NMS) to intact cells of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was studied. A single class of saturable binding sites was observed with a density of about 5000 sites per cell, and a pharmacological profile consistent with muscarinic receptors. The inhibition of 3H-NMS binding by the antagonist pirenzepine was of low affinity suggesting PC12 muscarinic receptors may be similar to those found on rat sympathetic nerve terminals.", 
    "15": "Brain [3H]diazepam and L-[3H]phenylisopropyladenosine binding sites in caffeine-treated (75 mg/kg/day, i.p. 12 days) and caffeine-withdrawn (30 days) rats were examined. Treatment with caffeine (75 mg/kg/day) for 12 days increases the Bmax (maximum binding capacity) for [3H]diazepam binding by 30.9% whereas the same treatment increased the Bmax for L-[3H]PIA binding by 120%. The Bmax for [3H]diazepam binding sites returns to slightly below control levels but L-[3H]PIA binding sites still remain elevated after 30 days of caffeine withdrawal. The up-regulation of [3H]diazepam binding sites seen in caffeine-treated rats may indicate an interaction between caffeine and benzodiazepines at the receptor level and it may account for the supersensitivity to benzodiazepines seen in behavioral testing.", 
    "16": "The effect of chronic caffeine treatment on three different binding sites in five brain areas of mice is characterized. The sites studied were the adenosine receptor, using [3H] diethylphenylxanthine, the benzodiazepine receptor, using [3H] diazepam and the adenosine uptake site, using [3H] nitrobenzylthioinosine. Significant increases were only observed in adenosine receptors with the greatest degree of change seen in the cerebellum and brain stem at both 16 and 23 days of caffeine treatment. The lack of significant effects of chronic caffeine on benzodiazepine receptors and adenosine uptake sites indicates that the caffeine effect is specific. The effect of chronic caffeine treatment on the ontogeny of adenosine receptors was also studied with the result showing a significantly accelerated development of the receptor in the caffeine treated animals. The adult adenosine receptor levels were 20-30% higher than those observed in control animals. The observed alterations in adenosine receptor number which occur as a consequence of caffeine consumption may underlie some of the behavioral effects of this cortical stimulant as well as provide insights concerning the mechanisms of tolerance to and dependence on caffeine.", 
    "17": "35S-t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binds in a concentration-saturable manner to specific sites on membranes from rat cerebral cortex. Using a filtration assay at 25 degrees C, in 250 mM NaCl, specific binding of 35S-TBPS constitutes about 84 to 94 percent of total binding, depending on radioligand concentrations. 35S-TBPS binding is optimal in the presence of NaCl or NaBr and substantially less in the presence of NaI or NaF. It is sensitive to the treatment with 0.05 percent Triton X-100 but not to repeated freezing and thawing, procedures which increase 3H-GABA binding. Pharmacological studies show that 35S-TBPS binding is strongly inhibited by GABA-A receptor agonists (e.g., GABA and muscimol) and by the noncompetitive antagonist, picrotoxin, but not the competitive antagonist, bicuculline. Compounds which enhance binding of radioactive GABA and benzodiazepines, such as the pyrazolopyridines, cartazolate and tracazolate, and a diaryltriazine, LY81067, are also potent inhibitors of 35S-TBPS binding, with LY81067 being the most effective. The effects of GABA, picrotoxin and LY81067 on the saturable binding of 35S-TBPS in cortical membranes are compared. The present findings are consistent with the interpretation that 35S-TBPS binds at or near the picrotoxin-sensitive anion recognition sites of the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxin receptor complex.", 
    "18": "Psychotropic agents can promote tumors and inhibit neoplastic cell growth. Diazepam which is cancerogenic in some animal models has no such potency in large epidemiologic studies. Neuroleptics increase serumprolactine but psychiatric patients treated with these agents are not of higher risk for breast cancer.", 
    "19": "[3H]Pirenzepine [( 3H]PZ) and [3H] (-)Quinuclidinylbenzilate [( 3H] (-)QNB) specific binding to soluble rat brain muscarinic cholinergic receptors was assessed as a function of time subsequent to receptor solubilization. The soluble brain muscarinic receptor is stable at 4 degrees C when assayed by [3H] (-)QNB binding (t 1/2 = 80 hrs). In contrast the pirenzepine state of the receptor decays rapidly (t 1/2 = 3.0 hrs). Prior occupation of the receptor with [3H] (-)QNB or [3H]PZ increases the receptor stability by two to five fold (t 1/2 QNB greater than 1,000 hrs; t 1/2 PZ = 6.5 hrs). These data indicate that pirenzepine binds to an allosteric state of the muscarinic receptor and that caution should be employed in the assignment of receptor subtypes based solely upon the binding of ligands which recognize unique conformational states.", 
    "20": "The concentration and turnover of catecholamines (CAs) were measured in the cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of rats exposed in utero to diazepam (DZ, 1.0, 2.5, or 10.0 mg/kg/day) over gestational days 13-20. Prenatal DZ induced a regionally specific, dose-related decrease in the level of norepinephrine (NE) (maximum decrease, 65%) and turnover rate of NE (maximum decrease, 85%) in the hypothalamus of 90-day-old adult rats. Dopamine levels were not altered in this region and neither of the CAs were altered in the other regions. Dividing the prenatal exposure period into two shorter periods revealed that late gestation (days 17-20) was the period when factors influencing NE function in the hypothalamus were most sensitive to DZ. Analysis of the development of the CA in the hypothalamus demonstrated that the effect of the prenatal exposure on NE levels did not become apparent until after 28 days of age. However, at 28 days, there was a dose-related increase in turnover rate of NE (maximum increase, 52%). Concurrent administration of the specific benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist RO15-1788 with DZ (2.5 mg/kg) to pregnant rats effectively reversed the effects of DZ in the hypothalamus of the adult offspring, suggesting that the effects were mediated via the BZ receptor. These data have provided insight into the intricate processes of neuronal development; in particular the importance of target cell-nerve terminal interactions and the role of early developing receptors.", 
    "21": "RO5-4864, a 1,4-benzodiazepine, has recently been shown to possess anticonvulsant, convulsant and anxiogenic properties and to inhibit Ca++-calmodulin-stimulated membrane phosphorylation. RO5-4864 inhibited the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPT) to cerebral cortex, cerebellar and hippocampus membranes, with an IC50 value of approximately 20 microM. TBPT binds apparently to the picrotoxinin site of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-ionophore complex and appears to be a site of action for several classes of convulsant, depressant and anxiolytic drugs that modulate GABAergic transmission. RO5-4864 inhibited [35S] TBPT binding in cerebral cortex, apparently competitively. Antagonists of GABA and central benzodiazepine sites did not interfere with the ability of RO5-4864 to inhibit [35S] TBPT binding. The properties of RO5-4864 to inhibit TBPT binding are similar to other convulsants and GABA antagonists (except bicuculline) which inhibit TBPT binding. These results suggest that RO5-4864 interacts with the TBPT binding sites of the oligomeric GABA receptor complex.", 
    "22": "Experiments were performed to examine the acute effects of cholecystokinin octapeptides and fragments on the active and passive avoidance behaviour of rats following peripheral and central administration. Both the sulphated (CCK-8-SE) and non-sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-NS) and also the COOH-terminal tetra-, penta-, hexa- and heptapeptides of cholecystokinin octapeptide facilitated the extinction of active avoidance behaviour and retention of passive avoidance behaviour. This latter effect of cholecystokinin octapeptides was reversed by anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide pretreatment, showing that in these test situations cholecystokinin octapeptides are able to modify fear-motivation or arousal of the animals; their effect is at least partly similar to that of the neuroleptic substance haloperidol. Subcutaneous treatment with CCK-8-SE or CCK-8-NS appeared to be 3-10 times more effective than intraperitoneal treatment. Following intracerebroventricular administration, 100-300 times lower doses were needed to cause a behavioural effect similar to that after subcutaneous injection. Microinjection of CCK-8-SE or CCK-8-NS in the fmol dose range into the nucleus accumbens facilitated the extinction of active avoidance behaviour and attenuated the retention of passive avoidance behaviour, while microinjection of these peptides into the central amygdaloid nucleus caused opposite effects on these behavioural tests. It seems that the neuroleptic-like effects of cholecystokinin octapeptides are mediated through the nucleus accumbens, and the opposite action (non neuroleptic-like) through the central amygdaloid nucleus.", 
    "23": "The effect of several pyrolysate mutagens on the benzodiazepine and GABA receptors was investigated. Of amino-gamma-carbolines, Trp-P-1 antagonized the suppressive effect of diazepam on the pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions and death, whereas Trp-P-2 by itself precipitated seizures and death in male mice. Both Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 inhibited the specific binding of [3H]diazepam and [3H]muscimol in rat brain membranes mainly by increasing Kd, indicating that these gamma-carbolines bind on benzodiazepine and GABA receptors. IC50S of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 on specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding were not changed by addition of GABA. The Hill coefficient of Trp-P-1 for displacing [3H]diazepam binding was about unity whereas that of Trp-P-2 was less than unity. These results suggest that Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 act as active antagonists or inverse agonists at benzodiazepine receptors. The convulsant effect of the gamma-carbolines may be mediated by an action on the central benzodiazepine receptors; however, the role of the effect on GABA receptors is not clear.", 
    "24": "The effects of chronic administration of haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide for 14 days on self-stimulation behavior were investigated in rats with electrodes chronically implanted in the lateral hypothalamus. Haloperidol produced a prominent decrease in self-stimulation behavior during chronic treatment, followed by a significant increase in the lever-pressing rate during a 2 week withdrawal period, with a return to the control level about 5 weeks after drug withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide produced a significant increase in self-stimulation behavior during chronic treatment. However, the lever-pressing rate was not significantly different from the control level during a 3 week observation period following drug withdrawal. These results indicate an increase in the sensitivity of central dopaminergic receptors following chronic haloperidol treatment, but not following chronic chlordiazepoxide treatment.", 
    "25": "The concentration kinetics of 14C labeled diazepam, chlorpromazine and iodoantipyrine were studied in several regions of rat brain shortly after intravenous (i.v.) administration by a quantitative autoradiographic method. A highly significant linear relationship was found between regional diazepam resp. chlorpromazine concentration, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) 1 min after injection. Moreover, a linear relationship was found between rCBF and, on the other hand, firstly diazepam concentration decrease between 1 and 2 min, secondly increase in chlorpromazine concentration between 1 and 5 min, and finally decrease of chlorpromazine concentration between 5 and 30 min. The regional kinetics of diazepam were compared with those of iodoantipyrine, a tracer assumed to be freely diffusible through the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "26": "Midazolam, the new investigational 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative with highly water-soluble salts, was studied as an anaesthesiological adjuvant in 11 patients undergoing elective caeserean section under epidural analgesia. I.v. administered midazolam, 0.075 mg/kg after delivery, caused a rapid and marked sedative effect, lasting for about 2-3 h. Short-lasting anterograde amnesia of about 30 to 60 min was reported as well. The serum levels of the parent drug and its active metabolites were determined in six cases by a radioreceptor assay and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated on the basis of these levels by a two-compartment open model. Up to 3 h after midazolam administration, good correlation between the sedative effect and serum drug levels was found. The rapid but short-lasting action can be explained by the pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam: a short distribution phase half-life (4.19 min), and a short elimination phase half-life (67.85 min) due to a high clearance value (13.18 ml/min/kg) and a moderate distribution volume (1.20 l/kg).", 
    "27": "In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted in rats to examine the possibility of either extrahepatic metabolism or saturable first-pass effect as an explanation for the unusual presystemic clearance of metoclopramide (I) previously reported. In vivo studies involved two-thirds hepatectomized rats and animals pretreated with carbon tetrachloride to induce hepatic necrosis, whereas in vitro studies involved incubation of equal amounts of I (5.0 mumol/mL) with various tissue homogenates (viz., liver, kidney, and lung) or their 9000 X g supernatant fractions. Results suggest that the metabolism of I principally occurs in the rat liver, and there was no evidence suggesting the involvement of kidney or lung tissue in the metabolism of I. Forty-eight-hour cumulative urinary excretion studies following oral and intravenous administration of less than or equal to 5.0 mg/kg of metoclopramide hydrochloride were conducted. The bioavailability (F) values of I at dosage levels 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/kg were 0.49, 0.75, 0.77, and 0.83, respectively. It is concluded that the liver is the primary organ for the metabolism of I in the rat and that the drug exhibits dose-dependent hepatic first-pass metabolism.", 
    "28": "Several by-products in the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of clonazepam, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam are isolated by a combination of TLC and HPLC. With mass and NMR spectroscopic methods the structures of the by-products are established. Some indications are given for possible modes of formation of the by-products.", 
    "29": "In seven healthy male subjects plasma cortisol was measured at 20 min intervals from 07.00 to 13.00 h, during a drug free control test and after oral administration of 30 and 60 mg oxazepam. A significant suppression of the plasma cortisol levels for about 2 h after 30 mg oxazepam, and for about 3 h after 60 mg oxazepam was observed. The suppression wore off before the oxazepam plasma concentration started to decline significantly.", 
    "30": "Thirty-six patients (29 males and 7 females) undergoing open-heart surgery received one of three different dose regimens of lorazepam. All received a weight-related oral dose (2 mg, 3 mg or 4 mg) pre-operatively for night sedation. Twenty-four patients had an additional weight-related dose (2 mg, 3 mg or 4 mg intravenously) either as part of the induction (12 patients) or just prior to connection of the heat-lung machine (12 patients). Plasma concentrations of lorazepam were measured 20 minutes after induction, immediately before bypass, 30 and 60 on bypass and 30 minutes after bypass. Only when additional intravenous lorazepam was given prior to connection to the heart-lung machine were plasma lorazepam concentrations obtained compatible with complete amnesia.", 
    "31": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function was investigated in alcoholic patients using the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Seventy-two patients were studied when they had been abstinent from alcohol for 3 to 6 weeks. Eight patients undergoing detoxification and 79 control subjects were investigated for comparison. Alcoholic patients after a 3- to 6-week abstinence period showed significantly higher prevalence of abnormal DST results (28%) than control subjects (11%). Patients undergoing detoxification showed even a higher prevalence of abnormal DST results (62%). Abnormal DST status was not associated with the presence of depression in these patients but was associated with abnormal liver function. It is supposed that abnormal DST responses in alcoholic patients are not diagnostic of depression but appear to be related to effects of alcohol either on liver metabolism or on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function or both.", 
    "32": "For two consecutive nights, 20 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without significant carbon dioxide retention were monitored by polysomnography in a sleep laboratory study of the effects of flurazepam ingestion. In a double-blind, controlled, randomized fashion, they ingested 30 mg of flurazepam or placebo on one night and the alternate compound on the other night. Flurazepam increased the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing events (p less than 0.01), the frequency of episodes of desaturation (p less than 0.01), the duration of desaturation (p less than 0.01), and the severity of desaturation (p less than 0.05). Although the findings were significant, the magnitude of the changes was small. In 17 of the 20 patients, the ingestion of a single 30-mg flurazepam tablet did not cause clinically significant oxygen desaturation or breathing disturbance. The active drug did increase total sleep time (p less than 0.001) and thus was an effective hypnotic in patients with COPD.", 
    "33": "This study was designed to investigate the relationship between subjective and objective effects of a benzodiazepine on the one hand, and the rate of increase of plasma concentration on the other. The pharmacokinetic variables of 10 normal volunteers were calculated following a single intravenous bolus injection of 1 mg of lorazepam, a benzodiazepine devoid of active metabolites. In six of the subjects rates of infusion could be calculated in order to achieve the same plasma concentration after 1 hour and 2 hours. In the main study, lorazepam was infused at two different rates on two separate occasions, with a third placebo infusion occasion. A balanced crossover design was used with single-blind procedures. Plasma concentrations, subjective ratings, quantified EEG recordings, and psychological performance tests were estimated before and at 1, 2, and 3 hours after the start of the infusions. The peak plasma concentrations achieved were the same at the end of the two drug infusions. EEG and some performance tests paralleled the plasma concentrations fairly closely, but subjective effects did not reach their maximum until the 3-hour point and were significantly greater after the 2-hour than after the 1-hour infusion. Drug doses, rate of penetration into the brain, and duration of exposure to the increasing concentrations of lorazepam seem more relevant factors for the time course and the intensity of the various initial effects of the drug than the rate of increase of plasma levels.", 
    "34": "Ten healthy subjects were fed three diets for 10 days each: a control diet, a cabbage and brussels sprouts--containing diet, and the control diet a second time. Oxazepam was taken on day 7 and acetaminophen on day 10 of each dietary regimen. The test diet stimulated the metabolism of acetaminophen, at least in part by enhanced glucuronidation, as evidenced by a 16% decrease in mean plasma AUC, a 17% increase in mean metabolic clearance rate, an increased ratio of acetaminophen glucuronide to acetaminophen in plasma from 1 to 11 hr after drug and an 8% increase in mean 24-hr urinary recovery of acetaminophen glucuronide, which returned toward control when the subjects were fed the control diet a second time. There were no comparable changes in the metabolism of acetaminophen to acetaminophen sulfate. When the subjects ate the test diet, 24-hr urinary recovery of the cysteine conjugate and of 3-methoxyacetaminophen sulfate, end-products of minor oxidative pathways, the former involving a toxic intermediate, decreased 13% and 22%. Cabbage and brussels sprouts induced a 17% decrease in mean plasma AUC and a 19% increase in mean metabolic clearance rate for oxazepam, but there was no change in mean plasma t1/2 for this drug, nor was there a change in ratio in plasma of oxazepam glucuronide to oxazepam.", 
    "35": "In a randomized study of 100 women (ASA 1-2) undergoing termination of pregnancy as outpatients, the combination of midazolam-fentanyl-nitrous oxide was compared with thiopentone-fentanyl-nitrous oxide. The induction time (the time recorded until disappearance of the palpebral reflex) was significantly longer in the midazolam group (40 s) than in the thiopentone group (31 s). There were no significant differences in heart rate or arterial pressure between the two groups. Thirty minutes after the termination of surgery the degree of awareness, estimated by means of Glasgow Coma Scale, was lower in the midazolam group. After 60 and 180 min the scores were equal. During recovery more patients experienced side-effects in the thiopentone group than in the midazolam group, the difference being statistically significant 72 h after discharge when 66% and 34% of the patients complained of side-effects, respectively. Midazolam is as suitable as thiopentone for the induction of anaesthesia in day-case surgery.",

    "37": "Hearts were excised from 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats and perfused in a modified Langendorff system to examine the interactions of fentanyl and diazepam on myocardial contractility as measured by left ventricular dP/dtmax. Various concentrations of fentanyl and diazepam were added to the nonrecirculating 37 degrees C perfusate to determine ED25 and ED50 for depression of dP/dtmax. Combinations of fentanyl and diazepam at a fixed negative inotropic potency ratio of 1:1 were used to determine the ED25 and ED50 of this combination. Isobolographic analyses performed at ED25 and ED50 revealed that the negative inotropic interaction of fentanyl and diazepam is purely additive. It is unlikely that a supraadditive negative inotropic effect can explain the supraadditive hemodynamic depression reported in humans when diazepam and fentanyl are combined; perhaps systemic vascular effects of this drug combination account for the clinical drug interactions.", 
    "38": "Intravenous diazepam rapidly relieved catatonic immobility in two schizophrenic patients, and oral diazepam maintained this therapeutic effect. Diazepam may be an immediately available and effective treatment for some patients with life-threatening catatonic disorders.", 
    "39": "Trials of hypnotic medications typically determine efficacy by examining changes in polysomnographically recorded sleep and in daytime performance. The authors employed daytime sleepiness as a new, potentially crucial criterion in such trials. Oxazepam and flurazepam were effective in improving some polysomnographically defined measures of nocturnal sleep in 14 patients with chronic insomnia; flurazepam produced substantial daytime sleepiness and oxazepam did not. Oxazepam produced some rebound insomnia, consisting of about an hour's reduction of polysomnographically defined sleep, but without gross mood disturbance or the patients' awareness of sleep loss.", 
    "40": "Antisecretory effect of single oral therapeutic doses of pirenzepine (25 mg and 50 mg) and cimetidine (200 mg and 400 mg) was studied in 12 patients with duodenal ulcer. Gastric secretion was studied in basal condition and after stimulation with pentagastrin. Basal, maximum and peak acid output, basal and maximum acidity, and basal and maximum volume were calculated after computerised correction for pyloric loss and duodenal reflux. Both drugs showed dose-related inhibition of all facets of gastric secretion. Cimetidine (200 mg) had a greater inhibitory effect on gastric basal secretion, but a similar effect on pentagastrin stimulated secretion as with pirenzepine (50 mg). Cimetidine (400 mg) showed about twice the inhibitory activity of pirenzepine (50 mg) both on basal and stimulated secretion.", 
    "41": "Oxazepam (2.5-80 mg/kg) induced significant mouse killing among large samples (N = 100/dose) of Holtzman strain albino rats. Meprobamate (2.5-80 mg/kg) and Chlorpromazine (0.5-4 mg/kg) did not induce killing. Despite its lesser tendency to induce aggression in humans, Oxazepam is as potent as Chlordiazepoxide for inducing killing by rats. Induction of mouse killing by rats appears to the predict clinical potency rather than the aggressive side-effects of anxiolytic benzodiazepines.", 
    "42": "The effect of anticonvulsant drugs was examined on brain GABA levels and GAD and GABA-T activities. The level of GABA was increased by the treatment with diphenylhydantoin. The drug had no effect on GABA-T activity, whereas GAD activity was inhibited. Carbamazepine increased the GABA level but did not effect GAD and GABA-T activities. Diazepam had no effect on GABA level and GAD activity, whereas it caused a slight inhibition of GABA-T activity. Phenobarbital administration decreased GABA level only at the higher concentration. Clonazepam effected only GAD activity. Some anticonvulsant drugs generally increase brain GABA level; however the lack of correlation with an effect on the GAD and GABA-T activities indicate that other factors than metabolism, such as membrane transport processes, are involved in the mechanism of action of anticonvulsant drugs.", 
    "43": "Startle-like responses were elicited electrically from the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) in darkness or in the presence of a light that had previously been paired with shocks. These startle-like responses were potentiated by the light and potentiation was selectively decreased by diazepam in a dose-related fashion (0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg). The benzodiazepine antagonist RO15-1788 attenuated the effect of diazepam. The data indicate that potentiation of electrically elicited startle behaves like acoustically elicited startle, providing further evidence that electrical elicitation of startle is a viable experimental technique.", 
    "44": "Twenty four patients with drug resistant epilepsy were given lorazepam and placebo added to their pre-existing drug regime. With lorazepam there was a significant reduction in seizures, especially in those with focal and partial complex attacks. The drug proved effective whether or not the patients regarded stress as a trigger to their seizures, but on the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire there were differences between those with high and low scores.", 
    "45": "In three prospective randomized studies six substances for intramuscular premedication were investigated and compared to placebo (NaCl 0.9%): diazepam (10-20 mg), flunitrazepam (1-2 mg), droperidol (2.5-5 mg), triflupromazin (10-20 mg), pethidin (50-100 mg) and buprenorphin (0.15-0.3 mg). The effects on preoperative stress were evaluated with psychometrical methods (ESB), heart rate, blood pressure and plasma-cortisol levels. Degree of sedation and side effects were recorded. Good effects on anxiety were found after flunitrazepam, diazepam and triflupromazin. The worst effects were found after droperidol and pethidin. Good effects on depression were found after pethidin, buprenorphin, diazepam and triflupromazin. The worst effects were found after droperidol. Asthenic patients were improved with diazepam and flunitrazepam, but deteriorated after placebo, pethidin, triflupromazin and droperidol. The physiological stress parameters were positively influenced by diazepam and flunitrazepam, but not after placebo and droperidol. Nausea and vomitus were found after buprenorphin, pethidin and droperidol; psychological and neurological problems occurred after droperidol. The highest degree of sedation was found after flunitrazepam, diazepam and droperidol. The day after surgery the patients found placebo, flunitrazepam, diazepam and triflupromazin to be the best premedications, pethidin and buprenorphin were inferior and droperidol was the poorest premedication.", 
    "46": "Many drugs are used in alcoholism treatment with the aim of reducing alcohol consumption and correcting alcohol-related psychosocial problems that lead to excessive drinking or result from it. Alcohol-sensitising drugs are used to reduce alcohol consumption with the expectation that improvement in other problem areas will follow. Drugs that share sedative-hypnotic actions with and cross-dependence to alcohol are often used during acute alcohol withdrawal reactions for symptomatic relief, to prevent major withdrawal symptoms, and to prevent and treat seizures. Alcohol abuse may be a form of self-medication, and treatment of an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as depression (with antidepressants), anxiety (with anxiolytics) or psychosis (with antipsychotics), is expected to reduce alcohol consumption. Pretreatment medical and psychiatric assessment of the patient is necessary to ensure that the drug therapy is appropriate to the patient's therapeutic goals and medical/psychological status. Use of the drug must be systematic and carefully monitored; the duration of treatment is determined individually for each patient on the basis of the response to the treatment as well by the development of adverse clinical effects. Ideally, the drug therapy allows the patient to establish resources necessary for continued abstinence after the drug treatment is stopped.", 
    "47": "The purpose of this single blind controlled multicentre trial was to compare the relative effectiveness of pirenzepine and cimetidine in healing endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers. One hundred and twenty six patients with duodenal ulcer were treated with a daily dose of 100 mg pirenzepine (50 mg each before breakfast and before the evening meal), and 128 patients were treated with 1000 mg cimetidine (200 mg with breakfast, lunch, and evening meal and 400 mg at bedtime). Endoscopy was repeated after four weeks by an endoscopist who had not been informed about the treatment. Pirenzepine showed a healing rate of 64.3%, cimetidine one of 73.4%. This difference is not statistically significant (one-sided test: chi 1(2) = 2.48). After four weeks a higher proportion of first ulcers than of recurrent lesions was healed. Pain relief was rapidly achieved with both drugs. A significant trend in favour of cimetidine may, however, not be clinically relevant considering the small difference in the absolute numbers of pain free days and nights. Adverse effects were rare and reversible. We conclude that the efficacy of pirenzepine is similar to that of cimetidine in healing duodenal ulcers.", 
    "48": "Anticholinergics have been used for many years to reduce gastric acid secretion (e.g., in peptic ulcer patients). Because of their side effects and the advent of histamine-2 receptor antagonists, however, anticholinergics are now used much less frequently as antisecretory agents. Recently, a selective antimuscarinic type of anticholinergic, pirenzepine, has been developed. This agent reduces acid secretion and heals ulcers without producing serious side effects, probably by preferentially blocking a certain subtype of muscarinic receptor for acetylcholine (M1 receptor). This article will review the current types and subtypes of cholinergic receptors and the mechanisms by which antimuscarinic agents, including pirenzepine, reduce gastric acid secretion.", 
    "49": "In rats receiving the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-transaminase inhibitor ethanolamine O-sulphate (EOS) in their drinking water for up to 28 days, the number of GABAA and GABAB binding sites was increased compared to controls. There was no change in binding affinity at GABAA or GABAB sites. One week after EOS withdrawal, the number of GABAA and GABAAB sites in previously treated EOS rats did not differ from controls. There was no difference in the number or affinity of benzodiazepine binding sites between EOS-treated and control rats during EOS administration or withdrawal. There was no difference in the stimulation of benzodiazepine binding by GABA (alone or in the presence of NaCl) during EOS administration. Cortical and cerebellar GABA concentration was increased 3.2- to 4.6-fold and cortical glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity reduced 30-42%. The current required to induce electroshock convulsions did not differ between EOS-treated rats and control rats during EOS administration. We speculate that the stimulus for the increased number of GABAA and GABAB binding sites is a reduction in GABA release subsequent to a reduction in GAD activity.", 
    "50": "[3H]Ro5-4864 binds to mouse thymoma cells in a specific, saturable, and reversible manner. Scatchard analysis shows a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 4.4 nM and a Bmax of 477 fmol per 10(6) cells. This benzodiazepine binding site is of the peripheral type, based on the relative potencies of Ro5-4864 and clonazepam in competing for [3H]diazepam binding. Fifteen benzodiazepines that bind to this site with affinities ranging from 6 nM to 1 microM also reversibly inhibit the proliferation of thymoma cells in culture at the micromolar dose range. There is a strong positive correlation (r = 0.85) between the binding constants of these compounds for the peripheral-type sites and their ED50 in inhibiting the uptake of [3H]thymidine into the cells. These sites may be involved in the regulation of thymoma cell proliferation.", 
    "51": "Binding levels of [3H]Ro5-4864, a ligand selective for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, are substantially higher in homogenates of the olfactory bulb than in the rest of the brain. Among peripheral tissues evaluated, high levels of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding are found in the nasal epithelium. Drug displacement studies show that these binding sites are pharmacologically of the peripheral type. Their presence in the nasal epithelium and in the olfactory bulb can be demonstrated in several different mammalian species. Autoradiographic studies of murine nose reveal a bipolar staining pattern around the cell bodies of the olfactory receptor cells, suggesting the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors on both processes of these bipolar neurons. In the brain a high density of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding sites occurs in the nerve fiber and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb. Throughout the rest of the brain [3H]Ro5-4864-associated silver grains are diffusely distributed with intense staining over the choroid plexus and along the ependymal linings of the ventricles. Both the distribution and the ontogenic development of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors differ from the central-type receptors. Intranasal irrigation with 5% ZnSO4 results in a 50% reduction of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in the olfactory bulb without affecting the density of central-type benzodiazepine receptors. Thus, [3H]Ro5-4864 binding sites in the olfactory bulb appear in large part to be localized to olfactory nerves which originate in the nasal epithelium.", 
    "52": "Studies of [3H]diazepam binding to intact rat pineal cells were carried out in tissue culture preparations. The binding was saturable, reversible and proportional to the number of cells used. Scatchard analysis resulted in a linear plot [Kd = 23 nM, maximum binding sites (Bmax) = 1.56 pmol/mg of protein for cells in monolayer culture; Kd = 7 nM, Bmax = 1.3 pmol/mg of protein for cells in suspension culture]. Inhibition constants (Ki) for clonazepam (500 nM), flunitrazepam (38 nM) and Ro-5-4864 (5 nM) indicated that the binding sites were probably of the \"peripheral\" type. In addition, the effects of diazepam on norepinephrine-stimulated N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity were studied in organ culture and dissociated cell culture. Diazepam (10-50 microM) both prolonged and increased the magnitude of the norepinephrine-induced increase in NAT activity but did not affect the initial rate of rise of enzyme activity. The effect was dose-dependent and was also seen with clonazepam, flunitrazepam and Ro-5-4864, but not with Ro-15-1788. Diazepam, by itself, at these concentrations, had no effect on NAT, but enzyme activity was increased by higher concentrations (0.1-1 mM). Although a relationship between the [3H]diazepam binding sites described here and the effect of benzodiazepines on NAT cannot be established from these studies, the data suggest that the benzodiazepines may alter melatonin levels through their action on NAT.", 
    "53": "The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the benzodiazepines (i.e., flurazepam) and norepinephrine (NE) share a common mechanism to facilitate cerebellar Purkinje neuron responsiveness to iontophoretically applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Extracellular activity was recorded from Purkinje neurons in halothane-anesthetized rats from each of the following groups: 1) naive, 2) acute or chronic flurazepam treated, 3) chronic desmethylimipramine treated and 4) injected with 6-hydroxydopamine. Single unit responses to pulsatile (10 sec duration at 45-sec intervals) iontophoretic administration of GABA were examined before, during and after NE or flurazepam microiontophoresis in all treatment groups. Drug response histograms were generated and used to quantitate NE and flurazepam effects on spontaneous activity and GABA-induced inhibitory responses. Doses of GABA sufficient to produce depression of Purkinje cell activity in naive rats (4-40 nA) suppressed firing rate in all Purkinje cells tested in drug-treated animals. In contrast to its consistent GABA facilitating action in naive controls, iontophoretically applied flurazepam was ineffective in augmenting GABA-induced suppression of Purkinje cell discharge in acute and chronic flurazepam-treated animals. Although GABA facilitation by NE was unaffected by acute systemic administration of a benzodiazepine, chronic treatment with flurazepam produced a subsensitivity to the noradrenergic GABA facilitating effects. Within 48 hr of withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepine treatment, both NE and flurazepam again enhanced GABA-induced suppression of Purkinje cell discharge routinely. Chronic desmethylimipramine treatment as well as iontophoresis of the blocking agents sotalol and fluphenazine which have been shown previously to block or reduce NE-mediated enhancement of GABA actions were ineffective in altering the facilitating effect of flurazepam on GABA. Likewise, 6-hydroxydopamine pretreatment had no effect on GABA augmentation by flurazepam. Thus, although flurazepam appears to act independently from the noradrenergic receptor system in augmenting GABA-induced depression of Purkinje cell discharge, a reversible subsensitivity to the GABA facilitating effects of both flurazepam and NE can be produced by chronic treatment with this benzodiazepine. On the basis of this \"cross-subsensitivity\" to NE and flurazepam actions, it seems reasonable to suggest that these two agents might enhance GABA inhibitory actions by a common biophysical mechanism subsequent to noradrenergic receptor activation.", 
    "54": "Benzodiazepine receptor binding was measured in cerebellar cortex of 15 patients with dominantly inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA). The majority of these patients had a moderate to marked Purkinje cell loss, as judged by the lowered levels of dentate nucleus gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a marker of Purkinje cells. Despite the reduction in Purkinje cell number cerebellar cortical benzodiazepine receptor density was either normal or slightly elevated in the OPCA patients. These results are in contrast to the findings in a mutant strain of mice deficient in Purkinje cells in which the concentration of benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellum is greatly reduced. Our data indicate that in the human, cerebellar cortical benzodiazepine receptors are either not significantly associated with Purkinje cells or that in OPCA Purkinje cell loss triggers a de novo synthesis of extra benzodiazepine binding sites. It is concluded that, in contrast with the rodent, in the human benzodiazepine receptor binding may not serve as a marker for cerebellar Purkinje cells.", 
    "55": "Potential interactions of ranitidine with antipyrine, diazepam, and lorazepam were evaluated. Ten healthy male subjects were injected intravenously with antipyrine (1.2 gm), diazepam (10 mg), or lorazepam (2 mg) on two randomly assigned occasions, once in the otherwise drug-free state and once while concurrently taking a therapeutic ranitidine dose of 150 mg every 12 hr. Kinetic analysis for antipyrine showed no change in elimination t1/2 between trials (mean, 11.6 and 11.5 hr) with no change in volume of distribution (Vd) or total clearance (0.77 and 0.75 ml/min/kg). Diazepam analysis also showed unchanged t1/2 (32.3 and 28.9 hr) with no change in Vd or total clearance (0.42 and 0.39 ml/min/kg). Lorazepam as well had unchanged t1/2 (11.7 and 11.3 hr), Vd, and total clearance (1.52 and 1.65 ml/min/kg). Therefore ranitidine, unlike cimetidine, has no effect on either human hepatic drug oxidation, as measured by antipyrine and diazepam clearance, or human drug conjugation, as measured by lorazepam clearance.", 
    "56": "A double-blind study involving healthy young adult males examined acute effects of two benzodiazepines (alprazolam 1 mg and lorazepam 2 mg) on long-term memory acquisition and retrieval, using Buschke's \"selective reminding\" task and a free recall task. Subjects learned lists consisting of high and low imagery nouns. The assessments, done at baseline and hourly for 4 hours after drug ingestion, also included two psychomotor tests and subjective ratings by subjects. Both benzodiazepines produced marked memory impairment. Contrary to the prevailing view that benzodiazepines primarily impair long-term memory acquisition rather than retrieval, results from Buschke's task indicated impairment of retrieval as well. This finding may be related to the procedures and assumptions of Buschke's task. The benzodiazepine-induced impairments increased over the course of successive trials on the same list. Both drugs decreased the normal superiority in recall of high imagery words relative to low imagery words, impaired psychomotor performance, and increased subjective sedation. Alprazolam and lorazepam produced equally intense impairments. Alprazolam tended to produce earlier impairment and earlier recovery.", 
    "57": "The aim of this work has been to investigate the mechanism by which diazepam counteracts the plasma corticosterone rise induced by stress in rats. This effect is reversed by pretreatment with RO151788 and CGS8216. This observation suggests that the effect is mediated by benzodiazepine-specific receptors in brain.", 
    "58": "The effects of diazepam and GABA on intestinal motility were investigated in fasted dogs fitted with strain-gauge transducers. Injected intravenously at 9.00 and 16.00 h, diazepam (0.5 mg kg-1) affected intestinal motility only during darkness i.e. from 19.00 to 7.00 h. These jejunal motor effects which were mimicked by GABA, (0.3 mg kg-1 i.v.) corresponded to a disruption of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) with an increased contractile activity. These results demonstrate that benzodiazepines affect the intestinal motility in dog and suggest that the effects are related to sleep-stages.", 
    "59": "The short- and intermediate-term actions, as well as the carryover and withdrawal effects, of quazepam , a new benzodiazepine hypnotic with a half-life of 60 to 100 hours, were compared with those of triazolam, a triazolodiazepine hypnotic with a half-line of 2 to 3 hours. Both the subjective effects of these drugs as well as their objective actions on the sleep EEG were sought. The study was conducted on two groups of six subjects with chronic insomnia who ranged in age from 32 to 56 years. Each subject was studied for 25 consecutive nights. Placebo was administered at bedtime on the first four nights, followed by 30 mg quazepam or 0.5 mg triazolam on the next 14 nights and by placebo again on the ensuing seven withdrawal nights. Both drugs increased the total sleep time during their administration and improved the subjective quality of sleep. Major differences, however, were observed on withdrawal. A significant and marked decrease in the total sleep time occurred with triazolam on the first withdrawal night. With quazepam , rebound insomnia was not observed at any time during the seven-day withdrawal period.", 
    "60": "Alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, was administered to 17 patients with alcoholic liver disease. The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma alprazolam concentrations were compared with data obtained from 17 normal subjects who were matched for age and sex. The rate of absorption of alprazolam was slower in patients with alcoholic liver disease. The time of maximum serum concentration was 3.3 hours, compared with 1.5 hour in normals (P less than 0.02). The maximum concentrations, however, did not differ (18.4 vs. 17.2 micrograms/ml). The elimination half-life of drug was longer in the patients (19.7 hours) than in the normal subjects (11.4 hours), while the clearance of the drug was slower in the patients with alcoholic liver disease (0.6 vs 1.2 ml/min/kg). The volumes of distribution (area) did not differ between the two groups (1.1 vs. 1.2 liter/kg). The changes in elimination half-life and clearance indicate that the metabolism of the drug is slowed in patients with alcoholic liver disease.", 
    "61": "Alfentanil (R 39 209, Rapifen), a new short-acting narcotic analgesic, has been used in five modifications of routine anaesthesia. The results of these observations are discussed, as well as the haemodynamic and pharmacokinetic data reported in literature. Rapid onset and short duration of action due to a short elimination half-life time and a low distribution volume offer new possibilities in anaesthesiology. In premedicated patients the drug provides analgesia for very short lasting procedures and can supplement hypnotics like etomidate, short-acting barbiturates and benzodiazepines, e.g. midazolam. Thus it becomes possible to obtain a very pleasant anaesthesia under controlled or assisted ventilation with nitrous oxide/oxygen for procedures of a short or mean duration without further need for volatile anaesthetics.", 
    "62": "A detailed analysis of the results of a multi-centre clinical trial shows that, while the relapse rate following recovery from an operationally defined depressive illness was smaller among patients subsequently treated with either amitryptiline or lithium than with a placebo, there was no clinically significant difference between the prophylactic efficacy of the 2 antidepressants. An account is given of the relative adverse effects of the treatments, and the implications of the findings are discussed.", 
    "63": "Twenty patients who had taken long-term benzodiazepines were submitted to brain CT scan examinations. Some scans appeared abnormal. The mean ventricular/brain area measured by planimetry was increased over mean values in an age- and sex-matched group of control subjects but was less than that in a group of alcoholics. There was no significant relationship between CT scan appearances and the duration of benzodiazepine therapy. The clinical significance of the findings is unclear.", 
    "64": "Alprazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine which is related to diazepam and other 1,4-benzodiazepines, and has a similar pharmacological profile. Relative to the newer benzodiazepines, alprazolam has an intermediate half-life of 10 to 12 hours in healthy young subjects. In placebo-controlled and double-blind comparative trials in patients with anxiety, alprazolam was of comparable efficacy to diazepam and generally caused a lower incidence of drowsiness. Alprazolam has antidepressant activity and has been shown to be similar in efficacy to imipramine in the treatment of unipolar depression. Thus, alprazolam may be particularly useful in patients with mixed anxiety/depression. However, its general acceptance as an antidepressant awaits further studies.", 
    "65": "Experiments on mice and rats were made to study the nootropic and anxiolytic properties of endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine receptors of nicotinamide and inosin and of their new structural analogs--NMF and AZN. They were shown to have overt antihypoxic and anxiolytic effects. NMF and AZN given in 10-fold lower doses than endogenous benzodiazepine ligands appeared more active than these compounds and almost similar to diazepam as regards the activity. The data obtained point to the possibility of a purposeful search for new efficacious psychotropic and nootropic substances in the series of compounds structurally related to endogenous ligand of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "66": "Common sense should guide the nonpsychiatrist physician in diagnosing and treating the symptom of anxiety. Possible causes of anxiety include various medical disorders in which anxiety is inherent, chronic illness, CNS stimulant intoxication, CNS depressant withdrawal, and primary psychiatric disorders, including the primary anxiety disorders. If none of these conditions is found, situational anxiety may be the diagnosis by exclusion. Generally, treatment should involve education and supportive psychotherapy, behavioral therapies designed to promote relaxation and adjustment to stress, and short-term pharmacotherapy. Although some clinical data from uncontrolled studies point to the possible importance of others drugs (eg, beta-blocking agents) in treating anxiety, the major pharmacotherapy rests with antianxiety drugs, particularly the benzodiazepine. Because each benzodiazepine appears to be relatively effective, a specific agent is selected for a particular clinical situation on the basis of its kinetic (especially its half-life) and side-effect profiles. A nonbenzodiazepine soon to be released in the United States, buspirone (Buspar), appears to be effective and nonaddictive and is not potentiated by alcohol. However, the final verdict as to its usefulness and safety in treating anxiety awaits results of further testing.", 
    "67": "We studied sleep and daytime function in insomniac patients who took either flurazepam, 30 mg, triazolam, 0.5 mg, or placebo 30 minutes before bedtime. Subjects were 21 patients with either a primary or a secondary diagnosis of chronic psychophysiological insomnia or insomnia associated with personality disorder. Seven subjects were randomly assigned to each condition. The study used a three group by 9 week, double-blind design with three nocturnal sleep recordings each week. During week 1, subjects took no capsules; week 2, subjects took placebo; weeks 3 to 7, flurazepam, triazolam, or placebo; weeks 8 and 9, placebo. Daytime tests for alertness and performance were administered during weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Flurazepam showed hypnotic efficacy for weeks 3 to 5. Triazolam showed hypnotic activity for weeks 3 to 7. Although not significant overall, discontinuation of flurazepam produced rebound insomnia in six of seven subjects sometime during the two withdrawal weeks. The relationship between plasma concentration of desalkylflurazepam, the principal active metabolite of flurazepam, and sleep disturbance suggested that the onset of the rebound insomnia depended on the rate of drug washout. Discontinuation of triazolam produced a significant rebound insomnia on the first and second nights of drug withdrawal. Placebo subjects showed improved sleep throughout weeks 2 to 9 of the study. Daytime testing revealed significantly decreased daytime alertness and decreased performance for flurazepam subjects during weeks 3 to 7, although these effects reverted toward baseline despite continued drug administration.", 
    "68": "It has been demonstrated previously that orally administered lorazepam can cause anterograde amnesia in young adults. In this study, the effects of 7.5 and 15 mg clorazepate and 1 and 2 mg lorazepam on recall were compared in 74 healthy adults. Word list presentation tests were administered to subjects at selected intervals to measure immediate and delayed recall. Statistically significant memory impairment was found with 2 mg lorazepam during both immediate and delayed recall testing. Clorazepate produced no statistically significant amnestic effects. The data suggest that benzodiazepines differ in their potential for causing memory impairment.", 
    "69": "Two oral doses of triazolam, 0.5 mg and 0.25 mg, have been compared with placebo in respect of their effects on ventilation, ventilatory response to carbon dioxide, heart rate, arterial pressure, sedation and performance in a variety of psychological tests in 12 healthy volunteers. The study was double-blind. Although triazolam caused dose-dependent sedation it did not decrease significantly the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. Respiratory rate was increased by triazolam. After triazolam 0.5 mg, increases in sedation score and deficits in cognitive function were still apparent 6 h after administration. Triazolam 0.25 mg produced no significant impairment of performance in any test after 3 h. The sensitivity of a number of psychological tests to triazolam has been discussed.", 
    "70": "In unanesthetized paralyzed rats, i.v. ethanol administration (0.5-2.0 g/kg) increased (by 30-120%) the firing rate of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra, pars compacta. Doses of 4.0 g/kg or higher produced an initial stimulation followed by a long-lasting inhibition of firing. On the contrary, in rats anesthetized with halothane (2.5% v/v in air) or with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg), doses of ethanol up to 2 g/kg failed to activate DA neurons, while a dose of 4 g/kg inhibited neuronal firing without the initial stimulant response. In unanesthetized-curarized rats, the i.v. administration of either chloral hydrate (100-400 mg/kg) or pentobarbital (10-40 mg/kg) or the inhalation of halothane (0.5-2.5% v/v in air) produced a dose-dependent increase in the firing rate of DA neurons. However, the maximum increase produced by these anesthetics was less pronounced and shorter lasting than that produced by ethanol."
