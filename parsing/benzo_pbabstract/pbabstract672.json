    "0": "A total of 773 admissions to Massachusetts General Hospital between 1962 and 1975 were due to acute overdosage with one or more psychotropic drugs. Benzodiazepine overdosage, particularly with diazepam, increased relative to other psychotropic drugs over the years. Only 12 admissions were due to benzodiazepine overdosage alone, and none of these patients were seriously ill or had significant complications. Multiple drugs were ingested in the other 87 cases, and the frequency and severity of complications among these individuals depended upon the type and quantity of other nonbenzodiazepines taken. For example, 21 of 31 patients who ingested benzodiazepines together with barbiturates experienced severe central nervous system (CNS) depression, and 14 of 31 required assisted ventilation. However, the frequency of such complications was nearly identical in a group of patients who ingested barbiturates alone. This report and a review of the literature suggest that serious intoxication following overdosage with a benzodiazepine derivative alone is unusual. Ingestion of benzodiazepines together with other drugs appears to be considerably more common than benzodiazepine overdosage alone as a cause of intoxication. The severity of intoxication in such cases of multiple drug ingestion probably depends largely on the type and quantity of nonbenzodiazepines.",

    "2": "Experiments were carried out in rats to (1) elaborate upon the sepcificity of drug action in the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), and (2) to evaluate the posible congruence of PAG sites of morphine-induced and stimulation-produced analgesis (SPA) applied at virtually identical PAG loci. It was demonstrated that the effect of morphine intracerebrally (i,c.) administered into the PAG was not duplicated by other centrally acting agents (chlorpromazine, chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital or naloxone) administered i.c. at the same PAG site. This selective action of morphine in the PAG was further demonstrated not to be test-bound since morphine significantly altered responding in all four of the analgesiometric tests employed. Thus, multiple i.c. injections of drugs at the same PAG locus were useful in demonstrating site specificity of drug action where behavioral and electroencephalographic methods alone had previously provided ambiguous information. Morphine-induced analgesia and SPA, evaluated at virtually coincident PAG sites, revealed only a general congruence of efficacious loci. The most effective PAG loci for morphine-induced analgesia were not the same as those for SPA; analgesia effected by one analgesia-producing manipulation did not reliably predict that analgesia would also be produced by the other analgesia-producing manipulation at the PAG sites examined. In general, the more efficacious analgesia-producing PAG loci were localized in the ventral-ventrolateral PAG.", 
    "3": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide and atropine on the acquisition of passive avoidance learning in rats were compared in two superficially similar but theoretically distinct forms of the step down task in an attempt to dissociate behaviourally the disinhibiting effects of these two classes of drug. In a discrete trial procedure both chlordiazepoxide and atropine significantly retarded acquisition; on retention testing under saline treatment alone, the initial chlordiazepoxide group showed no change in behaviour while the initial atropine group showed a facilitation. In a continuous trial procedure, however, atropine but not chlordiazepoxide produced an increase in the total number of step downs; despite this, these groups showed acquisition at similar rates, though learning was not shown on retention testing under saline alone. These results enabled the two classes of drug to be distinguished. The nature of the heterogeneity between the two test paradigms is discussed, and results interpreted in terms of possible differential drug effects on punishment and escape components of the tasks.", 
    "4": "Seventy volunteers were injected with diazepam (0.3 mg/kg), scopolamine (8 mug/kg), or placebo, followed 70 min later by another injection of physostigmine, physostigmine and methscopolamine (in case of diazepam treatment), or placebo. Physostigmine was given in two doses, 16 and 32 mug/kg; methscopolamine, 8 and 16 mug/kg. Subjects (Ss) were tested in groups of 5 in a double blind procedure with treatments distributed according to a Latin square design. Prior to treatment, Ss heard a series of lists of words, followed by an immediate recall test. Following the first injection, delayed free recall and recognition tests were given. The second drug was then injected, followed by a presentation of another two sets of lists which were tested similarly. Subjective feelings were also evaluated with a rating questionnaire. Diazepam and scopolamine did not affect recall of information which had been learned prior to drug injection. However, both drugs impaired the learning or acquisition of new information. Physostigmine, especially in its high dose, antagonized most of the memory deficits produced by scopolamine while those of diazepam remained. This is a strong indication that scopolamine acts centrally through an anticholinergic mechanism while diazepam may act through a different system.", 
    "5": "The purposes of this study were: (1) to test the usefulness of intensive design in detecting the effects of an established antianxiety agent in a single patient studied for a period as brief as 8 weeks and (2) to explore the usefulness of combining intensive and extensive designs by jointly analyzing the results from several similarly treated patients. Fifteen primarily anxious, psychoneurotic patients aged 21-50 and scoring 17 or more on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale were admitted to the study; and 11 completed the full treatment program. Medications were diazepam 5 mg t.i.d. and a matching placebo, administered under double-blind conditions. Patients were treated for 8 weeks, divided into 42-week blocks. In each block, the patient received diazepam 1 week and placebo the other, with the order in each block determined at random. The patient came weekly for evaluation, including, self-ratings on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL), global status, global change; reports of occupational and social function; resting pulse; reaction time; psychiatrist's ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, global status and global change. The patient also reported daily his mood on the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Mean deviations from the general trend for post-diazepam and postplacebo scores on each criterion were compared within patients. Diazepam-placebo differences on each criterion were analyzed between patients. Criteria that clearly recorded the anti-anxiety effect of diazepam as compared to placebo included the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the psychiatrist's global status and global change ratings, the SCL Anxiety and Somatization Scales, and the POMS Anxiety Scale. Other criteria that showed a reliable diazepam effect included SCL Depression (decrease), POMS Vigor (increase), POMS Fatigue (decrease), SCL Anger (increase), and reaction time (increase). The most sensitive criteria distinguished diazepam from placebo even when results were considered only from the first 6 patients during their first 4 weeks of treatment- a total of 24 patient weeks of treatment. The factors contributing to the sensitivity of this design were investigated and discussed.", 
    "6": "This experiment was conducted to examine effects of oxazolam, cloxazolam, CS-386, and reference drugs on socially induced suppression and aggression in pairs of monkeys. Oxazolam, cloxazolam, and CS-386, as well as other benzodiazepines, at both ataxic and non-ataxic doses, attenuated the socially induced suppression, but failed to show inhibitory effect on the on the socially induced aggression. Chlorpromazine, at both slight-sedative and non-sedative doses, reduced neither socially induced suppression nor aggression. Imipramine did not produce any significant effect in this study.", 
    "7": "A double-blind crossover trial of Medazepam was carried out in 14 anxious hospital patients. The mean self-adjusted dosage was 16.5 mg daily. The active drug was no more effective than placebo in relieving anxiety, which was rated both clinically and by the Middlesex Health Questionnaire (M.H.Q.) (Crown and Crisp, 1970). This may have been because the dose was relatively low for chronically anxious hospital patients. Even this dosage caused significantly higher scores on the M.H.Q. scale for depression. Braking and driving simulator tests were not adversely affected by Medazepam. In real driving conditions those taking the drug made significantly more technical, but not dangerous, errors. Pulse and blood pressure also were not affected.", 
    "8": "A rapid method for the determination of flunitrazepam and desmethylfflunitrazepam in human serum in the range 10-300 ng/ml is described. Both drugs are isolated from biological material by means of a single extraction, part of the organic phase is evaporated to dryness and the residue is dissolved in a small volume of benzene. Without further purification, the substance is determined gas chromatographically with an electron-capture detector configuration of 63Ni-type. The method permits the quantitative determination of at least 25-300 ng/ml with an overall recovery of flunitrazepam of 99.7 +/- 4.9% and of desmethylflunitrazepam of 98.6 +/- 7.8% from serum. All calculations were carried out by a data system that was programmed for this purpose. The limit of detection for flunitrazepam is of the order of 1 ng/ml in serum. The method is sufficiently sensitive and specific for therapy control purposes. The time needed for an analysis is less than 1 h.", 
    "9": "The exploratory behavior of pigs was studied in two successive daily 20-mn sessions in a two-compartment box by counting the number of crossings from one compartment to the other and observing the activity patterns. Injection of 1 mg/kg diazepam before the first session increased the number of crossings without affecting the temporal decline of activity within the session; treated pigs did not attempt to escape the experimental situation and tended to be more perseverative in their activity patterns than control pigs. Injected before the second session, diazepam did not modify the exploratory behavior. There was no evidence of a state-dissociation effect in experimental groups for which the treatment condition differed from one session to the other. These results are discussed with respect to current theories about the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "10": "1. The anticonvulsive potencies of diazepam, phenobarbital and baclofen against convulsions induced by oxygen under high pressure (OHP), by isoniazid and by strychnine were investigated in mice and rats. 2. The anticonvulsive potency of diazepam was much higher than that of phenobarbital and baclofen against all three types of convulsions. 3. The selective activity of diazepam against isoniazid induced convulsions in rats (dose ratio ED50 phenobarbital/ED50 diazepam: 400) could not be confirmed in mice (dose ratio ED50 phenobarbital/ED50 diazepam: 20-40), where diazepam was equipotent against all three types of convulsions. 4. Baclofen which does not inhibit strychnine induced convulsions was equipotent in inhibiting convulsions evoked by isoniazid and OHP in mice. 5. The results are in agreement with the postulated GABA-inhibitory mechanism of OHP induced convulsions, whereas they make a glycine inhibitory mechanism very unlikely. Although the results do not allow further conclusions about the mode of action of diazepam, a clinical trial of diazepam in OHP-induced convulsions should be considered.", 
    "11": "Imipramine, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and meprobamate inhibit incorporation of 3H-thymidine in human lymphocytes in culture. For the first three drugs, 50% inhibition occurs at a concentration of 5 X 10(-5) M, and for meprobamate at a concentration of 10(-3 M. Ethanol has no action up to 10(-1) M.", 
    "12": "Estimates of infarct size based on serial plasma creatine kinase (CK) changes have been made utilising the disappearance rate of CK from blood (kd) as one parameter. This study was performed to evaluate the effects on CK disappearance of myocardial infarction per se and selected drugs often used in the management of patients with myocardial infarction. Fifty-six conscious dogs were studied. Canine myocardial CK was isolated and radioactively labelled. Experiments were performed with intravenous injections of unlabelled CK or with radioactively labelled material. After injection, plasma CK activity declined monoexponentially (r = -0.95, n = 30) exceeding the rate of CK disappearance in vitro in whole blood or plasma. Three successive daily determinations of kd differed by less than or equal to 10% in the same dog (n = 5). Removal of radioactively labelled protein from plasma paralleled disappearance of plasma CK enzyme activity for several hours after i.v. injection of 14C-CK (n = 5). Myocardial infarction after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery altered kd by less than 10% (n = 5) estimated after i.v. injection of 14C-CK. Administration of large doses of Nembutal (30 mg-kg-1), morphine (2 mg-kg-1), or Valium (1 mg-kg-1) decreased kd markedly (n = 17), but low doses of morphine (0-2 mg-kg-1) or Valium (0-1 mg-kg-1) did not substantially diminish kd. Thus, enzymatic estimates of infarct size are not likely to be influenced by changes in kd occurring during myocardial infarction. However, modification of estimates may be required when pharmacological interventions are employed, capable of altering CK disappearance.",

Effect of premedication with cystamine on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of nitrazepam. Acta Physiol. Pol. 1977, 28 (2): 161--168. In the experiments carried out on rats the radiation disease was evoked by exposure to 600 R. The strongest radioprotective action of cystamine was found on the 3-rd day of radiation disease. The tendency to normalization of both the pharmacodynamics (exploring mobility and anticonvulsant action) and pharmacokinetics of nitrazepam in the animals premedicated with cystamine was described.", 
    "14": "The action of intravenously administered diazepam (Valium) on postsynaptic inhibition was studied in cat motor cortex. The efficacy of postsynaptic inhibition of pyramidal tract cells was measured as the ability to suppress action potential generation. Diazepam increased the suppression of action potentials by inhibition. This effect may explain the anticonvulsant action of diazepam.", 
    "15": "It has been shown that bicuculline--GABA-ergic receptors specific blocking agent in doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg (subcutaneously), and thiosemicarbazide (inhibiting the brain GABA synthesis) in dose of 5.0 and 8.0 mg/kg (subcutaneously) were capable of antagonizing diazepam effects and of reducing its tranquilizing activity in an experimental test of conflict behavior in rats. Bicuculline exhibited a more pronounced antagonism to diazepam than thiosemicarbazide. The data obtained testified to a possible involvement of the GABA-ergic mechanisms in the realization of the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines.", 
    "16": "1 The effects have been investigated of various reserpine-like, neuroleptic, antidepressant and other compounds on the adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP)-dependent uptake of noradrenaline (NA) (reserpine-sensitive) and tryptamine (reserpine-resistant) by membranes of isolated chromaffin granules of bovine adrenal medulla. 2 Reserpine and Ro 4-1284 (2-hydroxy-2-ethyl-3-isobutyl-9,10-dimethoxy-hexahydro-11bH-benzo(a)quinolizine) as well as neuroleptics (e.g. chlorpromazine and haloperidol) inhibited the NA uptake, but the reserpine-like drugs were more potent. In contrast, Ro 4-1284 showed a considerably weaker effect thatn the neuroleptics in interfering with tryptamine uptake. Chlorpromazine had about the same potency in inhibiting NA and tryptamine uptake, whereas the action of haloperidol was more pronounced on the uptake of NA than of tryptamine. 3 The relative potencies of neuroleptic drugs in inhibiting NA uptake by granule membranes in vitro corresponded only partly to their relative potencies in enhancing dopamine turnover in vivo. 4 The inhibition of NA uptake by chloropromazine and Ro 4-1284 appeared to be of the noncompetitive type. 5 Chlorpromazine did not influence the decrease in ATP induced by granule membranes in the incubation medium. 6 Other basic, but not acidic compounds also inhibited NA uptake by granule membranes; their potency was of the order of that of chlorpromazine (antidepressants) or weaker (e.g. benzodiazepines). 7 In conclusion, the mechanism of action of neuroleptics probably differs from that of reserpine-like drugs in the inhibition of monoamine uptake by membranes of catecholamine storage organelles. While interference with the granular storage of dopamine at the granule membrane level may contribute to the in vivo action of neuroleptics (e.g. in enhancing dopamine turnover), additional effects of these drugs must be involved in vivo, e.g. blockade of pre- and postsynaptic dopamine receptors.", 
    "17": "Effects on the central nervous system of ID-690, a new benzodiazepine derivative were investigated and compared mainly with those of diazepam in mice and rats. Locomotor activity of the rat was increased with ID-690, at doses of 2 approximately 5 mg/kg p.o., as with diazepam. ID-690 was approximately 5 times more potent than diazepam in inhibiting fighting behavior of long-term isolated mice. Hyperemotionality induced by either septal lesions or olfactory bulbectomy was also inhibited by ID-690. This effect was almost the same in potency as that of diazepam. ID-690 was only 1/30 as potent as diazepam in preventing maximal electroshock convulsion, while it was approximately 18 times more potent that diazepam in suppressing pentetrazol convulsion in mice. ID-690 was approximately 5 times as potent as diazepam in impairing rotarod performance in mice. The muscle relaxant effect of ID-690 was approximately 10 times as potent as diazepam, as measured with an inclined screen test in mice. Thus the effect of ID-690, as compared with diazepam, was characterized by its relatively potent muscle relaxant and extremely potent anti-pentetrazol convulsant action.", 
    "18": "The effects of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide on tail pinch (TP)-induced behavior were investigated. Five mg/kg enhanced TP-induced eating in terms of both latency and duration. Twenty mg/kg had decremental effects. All doses of the drug reduced the incidence of clip-directed behavior, but increased locomotor activity during the TP trials in a dose-dependent manner. On control trials, the drug increased locomotor activity at the low dose and eating at the high dose. The results are examined in terms of the various behavioral actions of the minor tranquilizers. The implications for the behavioral and neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying TP-induced and other forms of stimulus-bound behavior are discussed.", 
    "19": "The purpose of this series of experiments was to understand how Clonazepam changes the mechanisms of synchronization in seizures. Penicillin was applied to the rabbits cortex. Interictal spikes and seizures were recorded with multiple electrodes from both the cortical surface and intracortically. The spatio-temporal relationships during these electrical events were studied by topographical methods. Moreover, power spectrum and coherence estimates were performed. A most characteristic feature seen with low doses of Clonazepam is a regularization of the spatio-temporal behaviour of both spikes and seizures. The number of tonic phases considerably increases at the cost of clonic phases. The seizures take more time to become generalized. The generator-zones become larger. This is explained by a decrease of the number of neurones--by Clonazepam--which are still left to produce \"paroxysmal depolarization shifts\". The findings confirm the increase of postsynaptic cortical inhibition under Clonazepam, as demonstrated by various authors.", 
    "20": "Electrical stimulation of the visual cortex evoked the cortical focal seizure restricted in the neighbor cortex of the stimulated area in gallamine-immobilized cats. The present experiment was performed to clarify the participation of anticonvulsants in the cortex itself. Phenytoin and carbamazepine depressed the focal seizure, as indicated by the shortening of seizure duration and the suppression of spreading. In addition, the high-frequency components in seizure disappeared with the use of these drugs. Phenobarbital and diazepam also shortened the seizure duration. However, the high-frequency components did not disappear although seizure amplitude was depressed. Trimethadione, acetazolamide, and dipropylacetate facilitated the focal seizure. From these results, the participation of the drugs affecting grand mal and partial epilepsies in the cortex is suggested. In addition, this experimental model is though to be useful in elucidating possible modes or mechanisms of anticonvulsant action on cortical neurons by analyzing, after drug administration, the changes in seizure patterns which seem to reflect underlying neuronal changes.", 
    "21": "In the treatment of epilepsy often several substances with anticonvulsive effect are combined. Possible drug interactions in these cases can change the desired effect of treatment. Simultaneous administration of clonazepam or dipropylacetate (the latter in a short term combination) with diphenylhydantoin can cause a significant increase of diphenylhydantoin serum concentrations and intoxications. The combination of carbamazepin with diphenylhydantoin can cause a decrease of diphenylhydantoin serum concentrations. The simultaneous administration of diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital can produce a significant increase of phenobarbital levels in the statistical average and in the case of a combination of primidon and diphenylhydantoin an intoxication by the primidon metabolite phenobarbital. These possible interactions which are not obvious at the beginning of therapy are supplemented by other factors as intercurrent diseases or erratic drug intake. With routine measurements of serum concentrations of anticonvulsive drugs some of these interfering factors can be eliminated by realizing them in time. Treatment becomes more effective and side effects are reduced. The development of a new check list for the treatment of epileptic patients should also improve the control and give better informations about the course of the disease.", 
    "22": "Tetracycline (2 and 20 micronM) inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated rat islets of Langerhans, although it failed to alter tolbutamide-stimulated insulin release. Diazepam (10 micronM) potentiated tolbutamide-stimulated insulin release and at a concentration of 1 mM increased glucose-stimulated insulin release. Tetracycline (20 and 200 micronM) or diazepam (10, 100 and 1,000 micronM) inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity of islets homogenate. These results suggest that the effect of tetracycline on insulin secretion might be in part due to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase of the islets. However, the effect of diazepam on insulin secretion is not mediated through the adenylyl cyclase system.", 
    "23": "Intravenous diazepam was administered to 4 groups of 35 patients as a surgical premedicant, double blind and according to a randomized sequence. Four dosages were used: 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg. Amnesia, relief of anxiety, sedation, and patient acceptance were primarily evaluated. While a significant linear dose effect was found for sedation, anxiety releief, and patient acceptance, this was not true for anmesia, which was clinically present only with doses of 10 and 20 mg. No significant adverse effects were noted at any dosage, and vital signs remained stable in all patients studied.", 
    "24": "Doxepin is closely related in structure and general pharmacological properties to other tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline and imipramine. It combines antidepressant activity with a sedative effect and in this respect resembles amitriptyline, with which it shares a similar profile of clinical action. The mood elevating effect of doxepin appears to be similar to that of amitriptyline but is probably less marked than that of imipramine and in some studies has been slower to take effect than imipramine. At dosages which have achieved a similar overall response rate, doxepin tends to cause fewer or less troublesome side-effects than imipramine, amitriptyline or amitriptyline-prephenazine. The more marked sedative properties of doxepin make it more useful than imipramine in depressed patients with sleep distrubances and in depression associated with anxiety. The benzodiazepines remain the drugs of choice in anxiety states. but when anxiety is accompained by significant depression, doxepin is more effective than chlordiazepoxide or diazepam. Doxepin is usually well tolerated, and in particular by the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease. Side-effects are similar in nature to those of other tricyclic antidepressants, with dry mouth, drowsiness and constipation being the most common. Postural hypotension is uncommon. Although doxepin appears to cause fewer cardiovascular side-effects in usual therapeutic doses, it has an intrinsic cardiotoxicity on overdosage similar to other tricyclics.", 
    "25": "A patient with post-hypoxic myoclonus, sensitive to therapy with 5-hydroxytryptophan and clonazepam, was subjected to detailed electrophysiological investigation. Brief generalised jerks followed the critical stimulus of muscle stretch. The electroencephalogram showed generalised spikes that were associated with, but not time locked to, the myoclonus. The cranial nerve nuclei were activated upward. Analysis of the findings suggests that the mechanism of the myoclonus is hyperactivity of a reflex mediated in the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata.",

The patient answers all questions, moves his body into any wanted position and when ordered he performs Valsalva's manoeuver without any remembrane. If not spoken to and having no pain he falls asleep right away. Postoperative vomiting is reduced. The patient feels relaxed after waking up. No complications have been noticed during more than 500 operations. The later questioning of all patients showed only 4 patients (with unsufficient preoperative sedation) who could remember part of the terminal phase of the operation.", 
    "27": "Two ad hoc surveys on drugs prescribed in Reykjavik during November 1972 and November 1974 were made. After the first survey a publicity campaign was launched and doctors were encouraged to change their prescribing habits; only minor changes in docotors' prescribing habits were noticed, although it is realised that this type of programme will require a longer period to prove its effectiveness. The surveys showed that benzodiazepines are more widely prescribed than chlorodiazepoxide. Doctors have been warned of the probable addictive effect of benzodiazepines (Grimsson et al., 1974). Drug addicts who used to go from one surgery to another have now been identified and they can only receive drugs on prescription from their own family doctor or his deputy.", 
    "28": "Forty derivatives (1-40) of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine were synthesized and evaluated for antianxiety properties via gross behavioral observations in rats. Five of these compounds, including 5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine (6) and the 3-fluoro (7), 3-chloro (8), 3-bromo (9), and 3-iodo (10) derivatives, were selected for advanced evaluation. Although 6 and 7 had marginal activity, 8-10 had an anxiolytic effect in animals comparable to the clinically useful benzodiazepines, diazepam, and chlorodiazepoxide. Comparison with chlorpromazine indicated that 6-10 are probably not antipsychotic agents. These compounds also lacked activity in anticonvulsant and analgesic tests. Acute toxicity data (mouse, ip and po) indicated that 8-10 had excellent therapeutic ratios, although 10 was more poorly absorbed than 8 and 9. Further demonstration of anxiolytic efficacy was obtained by comparing the effects of 8 and 9 with the benzodiazepines in modifying provoked aggression in monkeys, rats (muricide), and fighting mice. The most remarkable observation, however, was that 8 and 9 had no effect, at the anxiolytic threshold, in potentiating the CNS depressant effects of ethanol or sodium barbital (po) in treated mice. In contrast, diazepam and chlorodiazepoxide potentiated this drug interaction effect at minimal anxiolytic doses.", 
    "29": "Seventy-two private practice patients with moderate or severe anxiety-depressive neurosis received mean daily oral doses of 23.8 mg bromazepam, 94 mg amitriptyline, or 4.6 capsules of placebo in a double-blind four-week study. The patient's condition was assessed initially and at weekly intervals by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression. From the first through the fourth week evaluations, a larger proportion of patients improved on bromazepam than on amitriptyline. Bromazepam was also superior to amitriptyline and placebo in the degree of improvement made Statistical significance (p less than 0.05) of the changes noted after one week was even greater after four weeks, particularly in BPRS items of somatic concern, depressive mood, anxiety and tension and in nearly all representative psychic and somatic symptoms on the depression scale, confirmed by global evaluation. Compared to bromazepam patients, amitriptyline patients had significantly severer adverse reactions which were the major cause of the group's higher dropout rate (66% vs 33%). The prompt clinical response to bromazepam contributed to its superior safety and patient progress in that it was possible to carefully titrate dosage and thus help to control adverse reactions and allow patients to maintain alertness and productivity under therapy.", 
    "30": "To assess the potential hazards of flurazepam (Dalmane) therapy of insomnia in the elderly, the relation of dosage and patient age to the frequency of flurazepam-attributed adverse reactions was studied in 2,542 hospitalized medical patients. Adverse reactions, predominantly unwanted residual drowsiness, were reported in 78 flurazepam recipients (3.1%). None of the adverse reactions were serious. The frequency of reported toxicity increased with average daily dose, ranging from 1.3% among those receiving less than 15 mg/day to 12.3% at doses of 30 mg/day or more (p less than 0.001). Toxicity increased with age, progressively from 1.9% among those under 60 to 7.1% among those 80 or over (p less than 0.001). Unwanted effects of high-dose flurazepam were observed much more commonly in the elderly. Only 2.0% of those 70 years of age or older experienced adverse reactions at doses under 15 mg/day, as opposed to 39.0% at 30 mg or more per day. Low doses of flurazepam appear to be safe for elderly individuals, but they are susceptible to unwanted central nervous system depression at high doses.", 
    "31": "Our electromyographical findings show no evidence for a spinal or neurogenic origin of muscle stiffness in stiff-man syndrome. It is assumed that the tonic muscle rigidity is induced by abnormal impulses from the brainstem. The measured latencies of electrically induced muscle spasm in the legs are in accordance with this hypothetic site of origin. Muscle stiffness and spasm are decreased by the GABA derivative Baclofen as well as by Clonacepam, which is preferable to Diazepam because of less intense sedation. Spasms are increased by Chlorimipramine which may by used as a provocative test in uncertain cases. These pharmacological influences suggest an imbalance between a gabaminergic inhibitory and a noradrenergic and/or serotoninergic excitatory neuronal system.", 
    "32": "A controlled double-blind clinical trial using randomised blocks was carried out on 3 groups of 10 patients with internal diseases and a pain syndrome accompanied by anxiety. One group received the product under examination (FC 35aA) and the other two its components (dipotassic chlorazepate, paracetamol and codeine). FC 35aA gave the best results, pointing to synergism between its components. Increase of the pain threshold and of the actual involvement of the patient was achieved to an extent that the single components could not match when administered individually at the same doses.",

The dosis is sufficiently low for the patient to remain responsive and co-operative but practically painfree. The actual thermocoagulation is performed in intravenous methohexital sodium anaesthesia. The dosis is kept so low that the patient wakes up within 2--3 minutes and is able to inform the surgeon of the success or failure of the operation. If no relief from pain has been obtained a further 20 mg of methohexital are injected and the operation is repeated.", 
    "36": "Diazepam injected to pigs previously trained to perform an operant response for food according to a continuous reinforcement schedule significantly increased resistance to extinction compared to control pigs. In pigs submitted to a time-out procedure diazepam increased the number of nonreinforced responses at the beginning of the acquisition but was unable to disinhibit suppressed behaviour in the later stages of acquisition when the extinguished behaviour was well acquired. The results are discussed with respect to antiaversive or disinhibitory effects of benzodiazepines and an alternative interpretation, the strengthening of the prevailing behavioural tendency in the animal's repertoire at the time of test, is put forward.", 
    "37": "Condensation of o-phenylendiamine and N,N-dialkyl-ethoxycarbonylacetamides in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride afforded 2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-4-dialkylamino-1H-1,5-benzodiazepines. These same compounds with a substituent in the 3 position were obtained when N,N-dialkylamino-alpha-ethoxycarbonyl-alpha-alkylacetamides were employed in the reaction. In a similar manner from N-phenyl-o-phenylendiamine the synthesis of 1-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-4-dialkylamino-1H-1,5-benzodiazepines was achieved. The formation of benzimidazole-2-acetic acid derivatives was observed in these reactions.", 
    "38": "It was suggested by Gibson & Curran (1974) that the rather complex relationships found to obtain between hypnotic susceptibility and the personality parameters of extraversion and neuroticism might be understood by considering neuroticism as a moderator variable (as had been suggested by Furneaux & Gibson, 1961). They made the hypothesis that if a tranquillizing drug were administered the operative level of neuroticism would be decreased, and as a consequence the level of susceptibility of neurotic extraverts would be raised, and that of neurotic introverts lowered. This study reports the test-retest data on a sample of 71 subjects on the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scales, half of whom were retested with diazepam and half with nicotinic acid. The hypothesis was confirmed and additional data are given on the drug/placebo effects on each item of the scale. The significance of drugs on different aspects of hypnotic susceptibility in relation to personality is discussed.", 
    "39": "The experiments described were carried out in an attempt to determine the participation of adrenal catecholamines in the higher incidence of cardiac arrhythmias produced by acute stress or ouabain injections in diazepam-treated animals. The pretreatments of rats with diazepam (150 mg kg-1 d-1) increase significantly the adrenal catecholamine content. Consequently, the application of electrical and immobilization stress releases more catecholamines from the adrenal glands of the diazepam-treated rats and also produces higher incidence of ventricular extrasystoles. Furthermore, various pretreatments of rats with diazepam (5-150 mg kg-1 d-1) also lead to an increase in the catecholamine content of the adrenal gland. In diazepam-treated rats, the intravenous administration of ouabain produces a greater release of adrenal catecholamines as well as a greater incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain the elevation of adrenal catecholamines and also the higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "40": "The combination of fentanyl citrate (Sublimaze) and diazepam (Valium) was evaluated for efficacy of analgesia, sedation, and safety in 1,008 predominately outpatient urologic procedures. These procedures included prostate biopsies, basket extractions of ureteral calculi, internal urethrotomies, and cystourethroscopies. Ninety-two per cent were judged to be successful with regard to adequate tranquilization and relief of pain. No detrimental effects were seen with the recommmended method and dosage. This drug combination provides the clinician with an effective and safe alternative to local, general, or spinal anesthesia for many routine urologic procedures and allows them to becom true office procedures.", 
    "41": "A prospective survey was carried out by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in 12 University hospitals in Paris and included 12,764 women; 189 gave birth to babies with unequivocal, non-chromosomally based, malformations. There was a significant excess of malformed infants when women had taken phenothiazines during the first three months after the last menstrual period. This association did not seem due to chance or to bias and could not be explained by the influence of the outcome of previous pregnancies. These data are to be added to results of recent surveys showing a significant increase of malformations in children exposed in utero to anticonvulsants, carbamates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and amphetamines.", 
    "42": "4-Amidino derivatives and quaternary salts of tetrahydro-1,4-benzodiazepines were synthesized and evaluated for antihypertensive activity in conscious rats by the oral route. Included in this study were derivatives of 1,2,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3,2,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepine and 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11-octahydro[1,4]diazepino[6,5,4-jk]carbazole in which the 1 and 9 positions of tetrahydro-1,4-benzodiazepine are linked by an ethylene and a cyclohexenyl chain, respectively. Four compounds exhibited marked blood pressure lowering activity (greater than 50 mmHg) at doses of 75 mg/kg. Further study indicated that these compounds are effective by impairing transmission in the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "43": "Conditions for the routine separation of some benzodiazepines and their hydrolysis products, benzophenones, by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography have been developed. They were applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of benzodiazepines and benzophenones in biological material, e.g., blood and urine.", 
    "44": "The effect of the following drugs in therapeutic doses on somatosensory cortical evoked potentials was studied: methamphetamine, chlorpromazine, imipramine, diazepam, phenobarbital, pethidine, and novaminesulfone. Physiological saline was used as control. Each of these compounds was studied in 5 healthy subjects. Three evoked potentials were recorded before, and another three after administration of the drug. Each potential was averaged from 1024 single stimuli. None of the drugs, led to marked changes of the evoked potential, i.e., all data (latencies, amplitudes) were within the double standard deviation of the data obtained in normal subjects in a previous study. Although no significant changes were seen, some trends could be observed: methamphetamine and imipramine produced a decrease in the latency of the first positive peak, chlorpromazine increased the latency of the third positive peak. The amplitude of the third peak was reduced under phenobarbital. It is concluded that the drugs investigated in the presents study do not produce significant changes in the somatosensory cortical evoked potential and therefore drug application may be continued when evoked potentials are used for diagnostic purposes.", 
    "45": "Marcumar [3-(1-phenylpropyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin] was determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography from serum extracts after the oral application of its sodium salt solution. 4-Hydroxycoumarin was used as the internal standard and rats were used as the test animals. Furthermore mixtures containing anticoagulants and anti-epileptics were also analysed with the help of high-performance liquid chromatography.", 
    "46": "Compound 5,11-dihydro-11-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)acetyl]-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one dihydrochloride (pirenzepine, L-S 519) represents a new type of drug in ulcer therapy. It has been selected for broad clinical investigations because of its outstanding pharmacological profile. Pirenzepine is devoid of any central activity despite certain structural similarities in relation to psychotropic tricyclic compounds. The extraordinary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour of this compound can be easily derived from its inherent physicochemical properties: The inability to pass the blood-brain barrier as well as its inability to activate the unspecific and specific psychotropic receptors is due to thermodynamic factors.", 
    "47": "The article describes analytical methods concerning screening tests for clonazepam and nitrazepam and the 7-amino derivatives. Further a detailed method is reported for the separation and identificatin of the benzodiazepine pair de. The method described permits a sharp separation and the nitro compounds with TiCl3 on the plate and forming the 7-acetamido derivatives by subsequent separation in the second dimension with ethyl acetate/acetic anhydride. The method described permits a sharp separation and highly sensitive detection by diazotization and coupling with Bratton-Marshall reagent. Amounts as low as 0.02 microng per spot can be detected. Besides preparation methods are reported for 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-acetaminoclonazepam, 2-amino-2'-chloro-5-nitrobenzophenone and 2,5-diamino-2'-chlorobenzophenone. Also spectral data (UV, IR, MS) and a literature review are given.", 
    "48": "Acute experiments on nonanesthetized curare-treated rats with the recording of the neuronal activity of the cortex were conducted; a determination was made of the threshold doses in which diazepam influenced the spontaneous and induced activity of the neurons of the sensory-motor and optic cortex. Diazepam proved to depress the spontaneous and induced activity of the neurons of the sensory-motor and optic cortex. Diazepam proved to depress the spontaneous and induced activity of the neurons of the sensory-motor cortex in considerably lesser doses than the neuronal activity of the optic cortex. It is supposed that the neurons of the anterior portions of the cortex were more sensitive to diazepam than the neurons of the limbic structures and the reticular formation.", 
    "49": "A simple and specific radioimmunoassay was developed for the determination of the anticonvulsant agent clonazepam directly in plasma without extraction. Antibodies to clonazepam were produced in rabbits after immunization with an immunogen prepared by covalently linking the 3-hemisuccinyloxy derivative of clonazepam to bovine serum albumin. When employing 3H-clonazepam as the tracer, the radioimmunoassay has a limit of sensitivity of 5 ng/ml using a 0.1-ml sample of plasma. The antibodies exhibited a high degree of specificity for clonazepam; no cross-reactivity was observed with its 7-amino and 7-acetylamino metabolites nor with a number of other widely prescribed anticonvulsant agents that might be administered in conjuction with clonazepam. Satisfactory agreement was obtained for the plasma levels of clonazepam in humans when samples were assayed by the radioimmunoassay and an established electron-capture GC technique. By virtue ot its simplicity, the radioimmunoassay offers a distinct advantage to the clinician for monitoring plasma clonazepam levels and the compliance of patients undergoing anticonvulsant therapy with the drug."
