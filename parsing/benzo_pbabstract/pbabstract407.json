Just prior to induction of anesthesia flumazenil was administrated intravenously to reverse the effects of diazepam in both mother and fetus. Cesarean section was successful under general anesthesia (N2O-pentazocine). The neonate's Apgar score was 6 points at 1 minute and 7 points at 5 minutes after delivery. We conclude that intravenous administration of flumazenil just prior to Cesarean section is effective in a patient with convulsion treated with diazepam.", 
    "1": "The effects of small dose midazolam to reduce the uncomfortable feeling during epidural block procedure were studied. All 160 patients (ASA I approximately II) were premedicated with intramuscular (I.M.) atropine sulfate 0.5 mg and hydroxyzine 50 mg. To relieve pain and anxiety during epidural block procedure, small dose midazolam (1 mg; 80 patients) was given intravenously in the operating room before epidural procedure. After epidural block, patients were anesthetized with nitrous oxide-oxygen-isoflurane or nitrous oxide-oxygen-sevoflurane. The following day, patient's self-assessments of pain during epidural block procedure were categorized as good and fair. Midazolam 1 mg was effective in the males (from 45% to 10%) and tended to allay patients' pain feeling in the females (from 40% to 23%). To investigate the uncomfortable feeling 1 further asked the patients whether epidural block procedure was more noxious than I.M. premedication or not. Noxious feeling was expressed in more I.M. premedicated patients (78%) than in epidural block procedure patients (48%). These results suggest that small dose midazolam is effective to relieve patients' uncomfortable feeling due to its sedative and antianxiety effects.", 
    "2": "Effect of pirenzepine on gastric secretion during anesthesia and surgery was evaluated in 46 surgical patients ranged in age from 18 to 68 years. The patients underwent orthopedic, ophthalmic, ENT, plastic or non-abdominal general surgery under neuroleptanesthesia except two patients who had enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia. They received either pirenzepine 10 mg, 20 mg or the combination of pirenzepine 10 mg and famotidine 20 mg intravenously just before the induction of anesthesia. Volume and acidity of gastric juice were measured for 3 hours after the administration of these agents. Decrease in volume and acidity of gastric juice after pirenzepine 10 mg as well as after pirenzepine 20 mg continued for more than 3 hrs after the administration of the agents. Efficacy of the combination of pirenzepine and famotidine on gastric secretion was more prominent than that of pirenzepine alone in a double dose.", 
    "3": "Previous studies showed that chronic benzodiazepine administration in rats affected the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A/benzodiazepine receptor. The present experiment investigated the effects of chronic flurazepam treatment on the mRNA levels for alpha 1, alpha 5, gamma 2, and gamma 2L (an alternatively spliced product of the gamma 2 gene) subunits of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor in rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. Rats were treated with flurazepam for 2 or 4 weeks, and the mRNA levels were measured while rats were still receiving drug or 48 hr after 4-week flurazepam treatment had been stopped. The level of alpha 5 mRNA was also measured in other rats 4 hr after a single injection of flurazepam or diazepam. The levels of mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blotting using digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes. Compared with the pair-handled controls, the levels of gamma 2 subunit mRNA in cortex and hippocampus were not changed after flurazepam treatment for 2 weeks. However, with rats treated with flurazepam for 4 weeks the levels of gamma 2 subunit mRNA were significantly reduced in cortex (31%) and hippocampus (39%) but not in cerebellum. The values returned to control levels by 48 hr after termination of the treatment. The regional distribution and time course of reduced gamma 2 levels matched the decrease in benzodiazepine binding produced by the same chronic flurazepam treatment. The amounts of alpha 5 mRNA were reduced in cortex (23%) and hippocampus (18%) 4 hr after a single dose of flurazepam but not diazepam. The levels of alpha 5 mRNA remained reduced in cerebral cortex and hippocampus (about 50%) after 2 weeks but returned to control after 4 weeks of chronic treatment with flurazepam. No change in alpha 1 or gamma 2L subunit mRNAs was observed in any of the three brain regions examined after 4 weeks of flurazepam treatment. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptor down-regulation after chronic benzodiazepine treatment may be related to the reduced expression of gamma 2 subunit mRNA, and they also suggest differential temporal and regional regulation of alpha 5 and gamma 2 subunit mRNAs in rat brain.", 
    "4": "We have investigated the effect of chronic flurazepam HCl treatment on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex in cultured mammalian cortical neurons. Chronic flurazepam (1-5 microM, for 1-10 days) treatment did not produce any changes in the morphological appearance or the cell protein content of cortical neurons. The basal binding of [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H] Ro15-1788, and [3H]Ro15-4513 was also not altered after the chronic treatment. However, chronic flurazepam treatment produced uncoupling between GABA and pentobarbital sites and the [3H]flunitrazepam binding site. The EC50 values of GABA and pentobarbital were not significantly altered after chronic flurazepam treatment; however, their Emax values were decreased by approximately 50%. The effect of chronic flurazepam treatment on the observed uncoupling was both time and concentration dependent. Furthermore, the binding of [3H]GABA and t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate was also not altered by chronic flurazepam treatment. The effect of GABA on 36Cl influx was not altered after chronic flurazepam treatment; however, treatment significantly attenuated the ability of diazepam to enhance GABA-induced 36Cl influx. Chronic flurazepam-induced uncoupling and decreased diazepam efficacy were reversed by the concomitant presence of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788, suggesting that these events are mediated via the benzodiazepine receptor site. Taken together, these results suggest that chronic benzodiazepine treatment produces uncoupling of GABA and pentobarbital sites from the benzodiazepine site and decreased coupling between the benzodiazepine site and GABA receptor-gated Cl- channels. The uncoupling and decreased efficacy may be due to an alteration in the levels of various alpha subunits and may be responsible for the tolerance associated with chronic benzodiazepine agonist treatment.", 
    "5": "The inhibitory effect of high dose fentanyl (0.1 mg.kg-1) and diazepam (0.5 mg.kg-1) anaesthesia on the pituitary-adrenal response to coronary artery surgery during cardiopulmonary bypass was assessed by comparison of the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol responses to intravenous boluses of either 0.1 mg (n = 14) or 0.2 mg (n = 14) human corticotropin releasing hormone administered 5 min after starting cardiopulmonary bypass, with the responses obtained in a control group (n = 14). Blood samples were taken before inducing anaesthesia, just before cardiopulmonary bypass and at 5, 20, 35, 50, 65 and 80 min thereafter. The administration of human corticotropin releasing hormone at both doses resulted in significantly greater plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone at 50, 65 and 80 min compared to the control group; at the other sampling times there were no differences between the three groups. Plasma cortisol concentrations did not vary between the three groups at any sampling time. During cardiopulmonary bypass the early adrenocorticotropic responses to human corticotropin releasing hormone are blunted but later there is a good response, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of high dose fentanyl and diazepam anaesthesia takes place in the hypothalamus.", 
    "6": "The quantitative receptor autoradiographic method has been developed to determine the precise location and kinetic properties of receptors for biologically active transmitters, based on the original technique for benzodiazepine receptors in the rat brain with a 3H-labeled ligand. The autoradiography with hyperfilm-3H of cryostat sections (10- to 20-microns thick) incubated with appropriate 3H- or 125I-labeled ligands and analysis of the autoradiogram by computerized microdensitometry makes feasible quantitative determinations and complete characterization of receptors in tissues from a single animal and in human tissues obtained at autopsy. Furthermore, the autoradiographic technique has advantages over receptor binding assays with partially purified membrane preparations because it enables precise anatomical localization and has high sensitivity. In some cases, the autoradiogram can be quantitated with a computerized radioluminographic imaging-plate system. Special care has to be taken when a 3H-labeled ligand is used, since tissue quenching of the radioisotope energy of 3H is linked to the failure to attain precise quantitation of receptors in myelin-rich areas such as brain white matter. In combination with quantitative radioimmunohistochemical and in situ hybridization techniques, the quantitative receptor autoradiographic method should enable investigators to elucidate the roles of receptors for biologically active transmitters.", 
    "7": "The imidazobenzodiazepine 6-(2-bromophenyl)-8-fluoro-4H-imidazo-[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxamide (imidazenil) is a new anxiolytic and anticonvulsant ligand of the benzodiazepine recognition site that possesses the characteristics of a partial allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor. The effects of imidazenil on GABAA receptor function were examined both in vitro and in vivo. Imidazenil inhibited [3H] flumazenil binding to mouse cerebral cortical membranes in vitro with an IC50 of 0.9 nM, showing that this compound binds with high affinity to benzodiazepine receptors. However, imidazenil failed to modify t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to washed or unwashed mouse cortical membrane preparations. Furthermore, imidazenil injected i.p. into mice failed to affect [35S]TBPS binding subsequently measured in unwashed cortical membranes. In contrast, imidazenil reduced in a dose-dependent manner the increase in [35S]TBPS binding elicited by isoniazid (200 mg/kg s.c.), an effect mimicked by lorazepam and abecarnil++ but not by bretazenil. As expected, i.p. administration of lorazepam or abecarnil induced within 30 min a marked reduction in [35S]TBPS binding subsequently measured in unwashed cortical membranes of control mice. Moreover, imidazenil at a dose as low as 0.05 mg/kg (i.p.) delayed the onset of convulsions and death elicited by isoniazid and reduced significantly the number of mice exhibiting seizures. Accordingly, imidazenil also showed great potency in antagonizing the convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole in rats. Imidazenil also completely abolished the increase in [35S]TBPS binding induced by foot-shock or exposure to carbon dioxide. Finally, imidazenil antagonized both in vitro and in vivo the effects of bretazenil or lorazepam on GABAA receptor function.", 
    "8": "The gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-chloride channel complex is known to be the target site of dieldrin, a cyclodiene insecticide, and lindane. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of dieldrin interaction with the GABA system, whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed with rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in primary culture. When co-applied with GABA, dieldrin exerted a dual effect on the GABA-induced chloride current. The chloride current induced by 10 microM GABA was greatly enhanced by the first 20-sec co-application with 1 microM dieldrin, but the enhancement subsided during repeated co-applications, and the current was eventually suppressed below the control level. No recovery occurred after a prolonged washing with dieldrin-free solution. Desensitization of the chloride current was accelerated by dieldrin. However, when the period of co-application was limited to 2 sec, which was short enought to avoid desensitization, no suppression of current was observed during repeated co-applications and recovery occurred after washing. The desensitization and suppression occurred with an EC50 of 92 nM, whereas the enhancement required a higher EC50 at 754 nM. The GABA-induced chloride current comprised two components, one with a high sensitivity to dieldrin suppression with an EC50 of 5 nM and the other with a lower sensitivity with an EC50 of 92 nM. Dieldrin exerted its inhibitory effect on the GABA-induced current regardless of the presence or absence of pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide. However, its effect was attenuated by the presence of picrotoxin. Furthermore, dieldrin suppressed the GABA-induced chloride current in a noncompetitive manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Idiopathic recurring stupor (IRS) is a disease of unknown pathogenesis presenting with recurrent stuporous states. We describe three IRS patients in whom there were no metabolic, toxic, or structural brain dysfunctions. Ictal EEGs were characterized by fast (14- to 16-Hz), unreactive background activity. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, promptly resolved the clinical and EEG picture. In all patients, ictal plasma determination showed a marked increase in benzodiazepine-like activity identified as endozepine-4. IRS may be due to an unexplained excess of endozepine-4.", 
    "10": "We measured concentrations of meperidine and benzodiazepines in the umbilical serum of all live neonates born in Finland during a single week. Of the neonates, 31.1% were exposed to meperidine or benzodiazepines or both. One hundred twenty-one mothers of the 261 neonates exposed to meperidine were not recorded in the Finnish Medical Birth Registry as having received analgesic drugs. Infants born to primiparous mothers were more likely to be exposed. The exposures were associated with the type of delivery: vacuum extraction with a high proportion of neonates exposed to meperidine and elective caesarean section with a high proportion of neonates exposed to benzodiazepines. The exposures were influenced by the method of obstetric analgesia: epidural blockade was associated with more frequent exposure to meperidine. No significant circadian variation in exposures was detected. Validation of birth registry data is imperative before they are used for pharmacoepidemiologic studies.",

They were experienced but nondependent users of central nervous system depressants who had the ability to reliably distinguish 150 mg secobarbital from placebo and to report positive subjective effects. Subjects randomly received placebo and the two middle doses of diazepam, bretazenil, and alprazolam for the first 7 days of the study and, depending on their clinical response, received either the highest or the lowest dose of each drug for the remaining 3 days. Pharmacologic effects were assessed by use of objective tests (e.g., psychomotor performance), subject-rated questionnaires (e.g., Profile of Mood States), and observer-rated scales.", 
    "13": "All three drugs were clearly distinguishable from placebo on most measures. Diazepam and alprazolam produced dose-related psychomotor and memory impairment, whereas bretazenil produced a flatter slope. Both alprazolam and diazepam produced dose-dependent increases in subject and observer-rated sedation and liking, whereas bretazenil showed increases compared with placebo, but these effects were not dose dependent.", 
    "14": "Results from the study supported the view that bretazenil may have a partial agonist pharmacologic profile. Scores on subjective effects scales considered important for abuse liability assessment suggest a lower abuse liability of bretazenil than diazepam and alprazolam.", 
    "15": "Cloning of cDNAs that code for GABAA receptor subunits has revealed multiple receptor populations constructed from different subunit combinations. On native rat and cloned human GABAA receptors, the anticonvulsant compound loreclezole strongly potentiated GABA-mediated chloride currents. Using different combinations of human GABAA receptor subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes and transfected 293 cells, loreclezole was highly selective for receptors containing the beta 2 or beta 3 subunit over those containing the beta 1 subunit. Loreclezole was demonstrated to act at a site distinct from the benzodiazepine, barbiturate, and steroid sites with a unique subunit dependence. These results describe a previously unidentified modulatory site on the GABAA receptor beta subunit that allows pharmacological discrimination of different GABAA receptor subpopulations in the brain and provides a new target for putative anticonvulsant/anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "16": "We have examined the hypnotic effects of zopiclone 7.5 mg and temazepam 20 mg compared with placebo in a double-blind, randomized, clinical study of 60 patients on the night before operation. Evaluation was both subjective (visual analogue scales and a sleep questionnaire), to measure the quality of sleep, and objective (critical flicker fusion, object recall and paired associates tasks), to measure residual impairment. We found that zopiclone was an effective single-dose hypnotic with similar residual effects to the benzodiazepine and it may therefore provide a suitable alternative to benzodiazepines.", 
    "17": "We have compared, in 51 ASA II and III patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, an inhaled anaesthetic technique based on desflurane, supplemented with low-dose (10 micrograms kg-1) fentanyl, with an i.v. technique using high-dose (50 micrograms kg-1) fentanyl with midazolam for induction. Satisfactory records were available for analysis in 50 patients. There were no differences between groups in operating time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time or duration of stay in the intensive care unit after surgery. Desflurane maintained mean systemic arterial pressure at the awake level during incision and sternotomy (end-tidal concentrations 3.7% and 4.6%, respectively) but decreased it significantly at all other times. With fentanyl, mean systemic arterial pressure was unchanged from awake values during induction and laryngoscopy but increased significantly at incision and sternotomy by 8% and 12.8%, respectively, to exceed the desflurane group at sternotomy by 20 mm Hg (P < 0.001). With desflurane, heart rate remained at 60-67 beat min-1 at all times before cardiopulmonary bypass. This was always lower than the fentanyl group by 5-15 beat min-1 and the difference was significant at induction, during skin preparation and before aortic cannulation. In comparison with the desflurane group, cardiac index was significantly greater in the fentanyl group at induction, laryngoscopy and during skin preparation, but was significantly less before aortic cannulation. The need for vasodilator intervention was significantly more common in the fentanyl group before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass and for beta adrenoceptor block before cardiopulmonary bypass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "In order to investigate bacterial contamination of i.v. anaesthetic agents, given by infusion to critically ill patients, we have cultured residual infusion fluid from infusion syringes, 50 containing midazolam and 50 propofol. The infusions had been prepared with routine aseptic precautions and had been running for between 0.75 and 21.25 h. Only scanty growths of Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from seven syringes (four midazolam and three propofol). Small volume samples were more likely to produce bacterial growth than large volume specimens. Midazolam infusions made up in 5% glucose were more likely to be contaminated than those made up in 0.9% saline. Antibacterial activity was detected in 18 midazolam and one propofol filtrate. Midazolam infusions inhibited the growth of all seven of the S. epidermidis isolates, whereas propofol supported similar rates of multiplication to that obtained with control broth medium. The results of this study imply that contamination of the infusions probably occurred after they were disconnected from the patient. Despite the ability of propofol to support microbial multiplication, we have no evidence to suggest that this is clinically significant when infusions are prepared with conventional aseptic precautions.",

    "24": "Aortic rings were obtained from rat thoracic aorta and studied in vitro with and without functionally intact endothelium to determine whether \"the mechanism\" requires endothelium [or endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)]. In aortic rings precontracted with either phenylephrine (PE, 3 x 10(-8)-3 x 10(-7) mol/L) or KCl (40 mmol/L), midazolam produced concentration-dependent relaxation, with and without endothelium. Rings without endothelium demonstrated significantly less relaxation than those with endothelium regardless of whether they were precontracted with PE or KCl. With intact endothelium, midazolam produced greater relaxation in PE-contracted aortic rings than in KCl-contracted aortic rings; the midazolam concentration producing 50% relaxation from the contracted state (RC50) was 8.8 +/- 3.6 x 10(-7) mol/L for PE-contracted rings and 3.3 +/- 1.1 x 10(-6) mol/L for KCl-contracted rings (P < 0.05). In aortic rings with intact endothelium pretreated with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 10(-4) mol/L), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, midazolam produced relaxation of similar magnitude to that seen in the denuded aortic rings except at the highest concentration (1 x 10(-5) mol/L). Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (2.5 x 10(-5) mol/L), did not change the midazolam-induced relaxation in rings with intact endothelium as compared to untreated control aortic rings.

Sixty patients were randomly assigned to one of six sequences where anesthesia was maintained with etomidate, fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, or thiopental and nitrous oxide, or with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. The possible interaction of rocuronium with the anesthetics was quantified by determining the asymptotic steady-state rate of infusion (Iss) of rocuronium necessary to produce a constant 90% neuromuscular block. This was accomplished by applying nonlinear curve fitting to data on the cumulative dose requirement during the initial 90-min period after bolus administration of rocuronium. Patient characteristics and controller performance, i.e., the ability of the controller to maintain the neuromuscular block constant at the set-point, did not differ significantly between the groups. Iss values calculated per lean body mass were 0.64 +/- 0.22, 0.60 +/- 0.15, 0.61 +/- 0.21, 0.67 +/- 0.31, 0.63 +/- 0.15, and 0.39 +/- 0.17 mg.kg-1.h-1 in the etomidate, fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, thiopental, and isoflurane groups, respectively.

A DNA segment 650 bp long has been isolated that includes 151 bp of untranslated 5' end of the cDNA sequence and 500 bp of potential promoter-enhancer region. The transcriptional activity of this DNA segment linked to the firefly luciferase gene showed a strong orientation specificity. The promoter activity was localized to a 60-bp segment by deletion mapping. Mobility shift binding assay results suggest that this segment may interact with one or more factors in HeLa cell nuclear extracts to form a transcriptional complex.

Unsaturated FFAs with a carbon chain length between 16 and 22 carbon atoms enhanced [3H]diazepam binding in rat brain membrane preparations, whereas the saturated analogues had no effect. The enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding by oleic acid was independent of the incubation temperature (0-30 degrees C) of the binding assay and not additive to the enhancement by high concentrations of Cl-. In rat brain preparations, the stimulation of [3H]diazepam binding by oleic acid (10(-4) M) was independent of the ontogenetic development. Phylogenetically, large differences were found in the effect of unsaturated FFAs on [3H]diazepam and [3H]muscimol binding: In mammals and amphibians, unsaturated FFAs enhanced both [3H]-muscimol and [3H]diazepam binding to 150-250% of control binding. In 17 fish species studied, oleic acid (10(-4) M) stimulation of [3H]diazepam binding was weak (11 species), absent (four species), or reversed to inhibition (two species), whereas stimulation of [3H]muscimol binding was of the same magnitude as in mammals and amphibians. In 10 bird species studied, only weak enhancement of [3H]muscimol binding (110-130% of control) by oleic acid (10(-4) M) was found, whereas [3H]diazepam binding enhancement was similar to values in mammal species.

Ro5-4864 and PK11195 inhibited nerve-evoked contractions in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 42 microM. and 56 microM., respectively). Carbachol- and KCl-induced contractions were also inhibited by Ro5-4864 and PK11195. KCl-induced contractions were inhibited to a greater extent than carbachol-induced or field-stimulated contractions with all the drugs tested. Both Ro5-4864 and PK11195 significantly increased the ED50 for calcium-induced contractions following a cholinergic stimulus compared with control. These data demonstrate the presence of a PBR in urinary bladder capable of altering contractility in vitro through modulation of calcium activity.", 
    "34": "Lorazepam (Ativan, Wyeth) at dosages of 20-36 mg/kg was used to test for developmental toxicity in the mouse embryo/foetus model. Two separate regions were considered: (1) the central nervous system and (2) the roof of the mouth and the eyelids. In the first case a single administration of lorazepam was applied at the very beginning of the 9th gestation day. In the second, it was administered in preliminary tests on two consecutive gestation days between the 11th and 14th days and in later experiments once only on the 13th or 14th gestation day. In the first part of investigations regarding the development of the central nervous system, lorazepam unlike many other neurotropic drugs, was found not to induce any aberrations in the process of the neural tube closure. In the second part, in which palate closure and the temporary closure of eyelids were monitored, it was found that lorazepam does interfere with these processes. In order to test whether lorazepam's neurocristopathic activity can be prevented, suggesting the presence of benzodiazepine receptors in the neural crest cells, we used the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (Anexate, Roche). The results of these experiments indicated the flumazenil was able to prevent cleft palate and open eyelids cases almost completely if it was administered 3 hr after administration of lorazepam. If the treatments were administered in the reverse order, the frequency of neurocristopathy cases was unaffected, i.e. flumazenil did not influence the teratogenic activity of lorazepam.", 
    "35": "A number of experimental studies clearly suggest that benzodiazepines attenuate the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion possibly through inhibitory GABAergic neurons. There is some evidence that benzodiazepines act to inhibit stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. A comparison of the effects of a benzodiazepine on the stress- and CRH-induced activation in man has not been undertaken so far. We thus investigated the effects of the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam on both the stress- and CRH-induced changes in ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin secretion in ten healthy volunteers. In addition, hemodynamic parameters were studied. The subjects received either alprazolam (0.5 mg orally) or placebo 90 min prior to administration of CRH (100 ug i.v.) and to the performance of a mental stress technique. Blood samples, blood pressure and heart rate were taken every 15 min. The administration of alprazolam led to a highly significant attenuation of the ACTH increase following the stress interview. While ACTH increased from 12.4 to 26.7 pg/ml 15 min after the stress procedure in the placebo condition, there was almost no increase following alprazolam intake. An identical effect was found for cortisol secretion. Basal levels of prolactin were slightly enhanced in the alprazolam situation, while the stress-induced increase was not attenuated. Basal and stimulated systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and heart rate were also significantly attenuated by alprazolam intake. Following administration of CRH, the ACTH augmentation was only slightly affected following alprazolam, while there were no changes in cortisol and prolactin secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Muscarinic M1-receptor antagonists can prevent the induction of a long-lasting excitatory postsynaptic potential in autonomic ganglia. As the prolonged occupation of M1-receptors is a possible protective mechanism against vagal overstimulation, M1-antagonists might prove to be effective in preventing nocturnal wheeze. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether telenzepine, an M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, administered orally at different doses (1.5 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg) for one week, reduced airway obstruction in patients with nocturnal asthma in comparison with placebo. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) difference between each study medication (arithmetic means from values on days 4, 5 and 6) and baseline at 6 a.m. and at midnight on day 5 did not differ significantly. Treatment with placebo nocte (at night, 9 p.m.), or telenzepine 1.5 mg nocte, telenzepine 3 mg nocte and telenzepine 5 mg nocte did not affect significantly the 24-h time course of PEFR. The results of this study indicate that the use of telenzepine via the oral route at a dose of up to 5 mg is not effective in preventing nocturnal asthma.", 
    "37": "The effect of pretreatment with a 4-day course of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single oral dose of temazepam (10 mg) was investigated in 12 healthy young and nine elderly patient volunteers in a crossover design study. Temazepam clearance was lower in the elderly than in the young, but this difference was not statistically significant. Ciprofloxacin had no significant effect on temazepam pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in either age group.", 
    "38": "The hypnotic activity of N3-phenacyluridine in 2.0 mumol/mouse by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection was 20 times stronger than that of known N3-benzyluridine. In 0.5 mumol/mouse, i.c.v., this compound strongly potentiated both pentobarbital- and diazepam-induced sleep as compared to N3-substituted uridines, including N3-benzyluridine. Furthermore, the compound caused motor incoordination as well as decreasing spontaneous activity in the same dose. These results indicate that among the N3-substituted uridines and related compounds previously reported, N3-phenacyluridine possesses potent depressant effects.", 
    "39": "Behavioral effects of p.o. administration of SUN 8399, a selective 5-HT1A agonist, on the operant behavior under a MULT VI 1.5 min/FR 5-punishment schedule of food reinforcement and on the ambulatory activity were evaluated in mice, and the characteristics were compared with those of other 5-HT1A agonists, buspirone and tandospirone, and the benzodiazepine diazepam. Diazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly increased the punished response without eliciting any significant change in the non-punished response; i.e., showing anticonflict action. SUN 8399 (3-30 mg/kg) and buspirone (1-10 mg/kg) did not significantly change either the punished or non-punished responses. Tandospirone significantly increased the non-punished response at 10 mg/kg, but significantly decreased both the punished and non-punished responses at 30 mg/kg. The single administration of SUN 8399 (10 mg/kg), buspirone (3 and 30 mg/kg) and tandospirone (10 and 30 mg/kg) significantly increased the ambulatory activity, while diazepam tended to decrease it. The ambulation-increasing effect of methamphetamine (2 mg/kg, s.c.) was reduced by buspirone (10 and 30 mg/kg) and tandospirone (10 and 30 mg/kg), but enhanced by diazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg). Buspirone (30 mg/kg), tandospirone (10 and 30 mg/kg) and diazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the ambulation-increasing effect of scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). SUN 8399 (3-100 mg/kg) did not modify the effects of either methamphetamine or scopolamine. The present results suggest that 5-HT1A agonists scarcely show anticonflict action on the Geller-type conflict behavior in mice. However, SUN 8399 possesses different behavioral characteristics from those of the other two 5-HT1A agonists in terms of interactions with methamphetamine and scopolamine.", 
    "40": "The present study describes a detoxification method which takes only 4 h to complete. Eleven polydrug users addicted to opiates were detoxified 12 h after their last dose of heroin, in an intensive care unit. The detoxification was carried out using naltrexone, after sedation with midazolan. After detoxification (12 h) patients were discharged without withdrawal symptoms. This procedure offers a rapid detoxification procedure which seems to be widely accepted by the addicts themselves.", 
    "41": "Rats were trained to discriminate a dose of 1.75 mg/kg phencyclidine (PCP) from saline. During substitution tests, both PCP (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) and the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, MK-801 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) substituted for the PCP stimulus in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC, 0.1-5.6 mg/kg) and delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 8-THC, 0.3-5.6 mg/kg) failed to substitute for the PCP stimulus, up to doses that substantially decreased rate of responding. However, both delta 9-THC and delta 8-THC partially attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of the PCP training dose. Furthermore, a dose of 3.0 mg/kg delta 9-THC shifted the PCP dose-effect curve for discriminative stimulus effects to the right and shifted the PCP dose-effect curve for rate of responding to the left. The attenuation of the PCP stimulus by delta 9-THC lacked a strong dose-dependent relationship and was observed both at doses which did not alter rate of responding, as well as at doses which substantially decreased rate. In contrast to the effects observed with delta 9-THC and delta 8-THC, morphine, d-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide failed to attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects of PCP, even at doses that markedly decreased rate of responding. The present findings suggest that delta 9-THC and delta 8-THC alter the discriminative stimulus effects of PCP in a pharmacologically specific manner.", 
    "42": "Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to analyse changes in free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the cloned rat TRH receptor in response to TRH. In oocytes expressing TRH receptors, TRH invariably evoked a dose-dependent, biphasic calcium response. This response consisted of an initial transient planar wave of calcium propagating just below the surface of the membrane followed by a slower, secondary calcium phase. The TRH antagonist, chlordiazepoxide, markedly inhibited this calcium wave. The origins of calcium involved in this biphasic response were investigated using a variety of intra- and extra-cellular calcium antagonists. The intracellular calcium antagonists thapsigargin and TMB-8 reduced the initial and to a lesser extent the secondary phase of the planar calcium wave. In contrast, EGTA and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine produced a profound inhibition of the secondary phase while the initial phase was only slightly reduced. These results indicate that the release of intracellular calcium is predominantly responsible for the initial phase of the calcium wave while the influx of extracellular calcium is mainly involved in the secondary phase. Qualitative changes in the patterns of calcium release induced by TRH were observed following pretreatment with intracellular calcium antagonists. Following pretreatment with these compounds, TRH induced spiral or regenerative calcium waves. Addition of EGTA to the extracellular medium did not alter these responses confirming the importance of intracellular calcium in the generation of these spiral calcium waves. This study demonstrates the nature and multiplicity of regulating mechanisms of [Ca2+]i following activation of TRH receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.", 
    "43": "Atropine is routinely used as part of the premedication regimen for fibreoptic bronchoscopy. This study was performed, firstly, to evaluate the effect of anticholinergic agents on the ease of bronchoscopy, haemodynamic parameters and patient comfort during the procedure; and secondly, to compare atropine with glycopyrrolate, a newer acetylcholine antagonist which is claimed to cause less tachycardia and sedation, whilst suppressing salivation more effectively. One hundred and ninety consecutive patients were randomly allocated to three treatment groups: diazepam 5 mg; diazepam 5 mg + atropine 600 micrograms; and diazepam 5 mg + glycopyrrolate 300 micrograms. Diazepam was given orally one hour before bronchoscopy, and glycopyrrolate/atropine intramuscularly 30 min before bronchoscopy. All patients received thalamonal intravenously, lignocaine gel into one nostril, and lignocaine by transtracheal injection just prior to the procedure. The incidence of bronchoscopy related haemodynamic problems was similar in all three groups. Troublesome coughing, as observed by the operator, was less frequent with glycopyrrolate (control 51%, atropine 42%, glycopyrrolate 30%), as was patient movement (40%, 32%, 19%, respectively). Uncomfortable dryness of the mouth was most common with glycopyrrolate (37%, 32%, 66%, respectively), but overall assessment of discomfort, and the number of patients who would agree to a repeat bronchoscopy (73%, 76%, 70%, respectively) were very similar in all three groups. In conclusion, the differences between the three groups were slight. Glycopyrrolate made the bronchoscopy slightly easier for the operator because of significantly improved cough and movement suppression, though atropine was marginally preferable in terms of patient comfort.",

The compounds, preliminarily tested on explorative, muscle relaxing, antinociceptive, spontaneous motor activities and influence on the narcotic effect of Evipan, revealed interesting CNS depressant and analgesic activities. The pyrido[2,3-e]pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine structure of 7 appeared the most promising for analgesic and neuroleptic activities. The above compounds were assayed also for their capacity to inhibit DNA synthesis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells; 20a appeared to be able of inducing a significant inhibition.",

    "46": "The selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) and alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) rats have been shown to possess a number of behavioral and electrophysiological differences in response to alcohol. We sought to evaluate whether or not P and NP rats would respond differently to other sedative-hypnotic drugs related to ethanol. EEG recordings were conducted following systemic administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK 801 (0.1 mg/kg, ip) and the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex agonist diazepam (1.5 mg/kg, ip). Nine P and nine NP rats was implanted with bipolar stainless steel electrodes in the frontal cortex, the dorsal hippocampus, the ventral thalamus, and the anterior amygdala. In the vehicle condition, P rats showed significantly greater power of the EEG in the slow frequencies as compared with NP rats in the frontal cortex. Furthermore, P rats were found to have lower peak theta frequency (6-8 Hz) than NP rats in the frontal cortex, the dorsal hippocampus, and the ventral thalamus. MK 801 produced a significantly greater increase in the mean power of the EEG in NP rats in the 8-16 Hz than in P rats, whereas diazepam was found to decrease theta peak frequency (6-8 Hz), but more so in NP rats that in P rats. These data suggest that, in addition to differential responsiveness to alcohol, P and NP rats also differ in response to drugs that modify GABA and glutamate neurotransmission.", 
    "47": "Both animal and human studies suggest that the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex may be involved in the acute effects of ethanol, as well as the development of tolerance and dependence with chronic ethanol use. The current study was performed to assess sensitivity to benzodiazepines, and thus the functional sensitivity of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor system, in subjects at high risk for alcoholism. Sons of alcoholic fathers (SOAs; n = 27) were compared with male controls without a family history of alcoholism (n = 23) in response to diazepam versus placebo. SOAs and controls received four logarithmically increasing doses of intravenous diazepam or placebo in randomized order on 2 days at least 1 week apart. Effects of diazepam were assessed using two eye movement tasks, peak saccadic eye movement velocity, and average smooth pursuit eye movement gain, which provide reliable, quantitative measures of benzodiazepine effects. In addition, memory, self-rated sedation, and pleasurable drug effects were measured. In comparison with control subjects, SOAs displayed significantly less diazepam effects on peak saccade velocity, average smooth pursuit gain, memory, and self-rated sedation, but significantly greater pleasurable drug effects. Differences in response to diazepam between SOAs and male controls may reflect altered functional sensitivity of the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor system or a more general difference between groups in the effects of CNS active or sedating drugs.",

    "49": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is the major neurotransmitter released from the efferent fibers in the cochlea onto the outer hair cells (OHCs). The type of ACh receptor on OHCs and the events subsequent to receptor activation are unclear. Therefore we studied the effect of agonists and antagonists of the ACh receptor on isolated OHCs from the guinea pig. OHCs were recorded from in whole cell voltage and current clamp configuration. ACh induced an increase in outward K+ current (IACh) which hyperpolarized the OHCs. No desensitization to ACh application was observed. Cs+ replaced K+ in carrying the IACh. The IACh is Ca(2+)-dependent, time and voltage sensitive, and different from the IKCa induced by depolarization of the membrane potential. When tested at 100 microM, several agonists also induced outward current responses (acetylcholine > suberyldicholine > or = carbachol > DMPP) whereas nicotine, cytisine and muscarine did not. The IACh response to 10 microM ACh was blocked by low concentrations of traditional and non-traditional-nicotinic antagonists (strychnine > curare > bicuculline > alpha-bungarotoxin > thimethaphan) and by higher concentrations of muscarinic antagonists (atropine > 4-DAMP > AF-DX 116 > pirenzepine). Pharmacologically, the ACh receptor on OHCs is nicotinic.",

    "52": "To investigate the effect of peripheral and central benzodiazepine receptor ligands on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity in mouse macrophages, three types of ligands, 4'-chlorodiazepam (pure peripheral), midazolam (mixed), and clonazepam (pure central), were compared. Midazolam and 4'-chlorodiazepam significantly suppressed LPS (1-microgram/ml)-induced TNF activity in thioglycolate-elicited mouse macrophages. In every concentration examined (0.001 to 100 microM), 4'-chlorodiazepam was the most effective agent, clonazepam was the least effective agent, and midazolam had an effect intermediate between those of the other two ligands. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands had a dose-dependent suppressive effect, and the 50% inhibitory concentrations were 0.01 microM for 4'-chlorodiazepam and 5 microM for midazolam. Concomitant use of PK 11195 (10 microM), an antagonist of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, reversed this suppressive effect with 4'-chlorodiazepam (10 microM) or midazolam (10 microM). PK 11195 showed this antagonistic effect in a dose-dependent manner. Intravenous 4'-chlorodiazepam (5 mg/kg of body weight) significantly suppressed LPS (100-micrograms)-induced TNF activity of sera (2 h postchallenge with LPS) from thioglycolate-treated mice. The present findings suggest that the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor plays an important role in modulating LPS-induced TNF activity in mouse macrophages.", 
    "53": "Isolated from their mother, rat pups respond with changes in ultrasound vocalization (USV), a paradigm that can be used as a test for a large range of anxiolytics. Because the relation between corticosterone (CORT) and putative stress responses like USV is not clear, we examined the effects of the benzodiazepine drugs chlordiazepoxide and diazepam vs. the nonbenzodiazepine drugs buspirone and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on USV and plasma CORT concentrations. All drugs caused a dose-related decrease in USV, but only buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT induced a dose-related increase in CORT. We suggest that the seemingly paradoxical effects of buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT, that is, the decrease in USV and the concomitant increase in plasma CORT, are due to the fact that these two drugs act as full agonists at both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Our results indicate that, when measured as an increase in the activity of the pituitary adrenocortical axis, the stress response can be interpreted in markedly different ways, depending on whether the increased activity is elicited by an environmental stressor or by pharmacological manipulation.", 
    "54": "The use and abuse of benzodiazepines is widespread and we have begun to address whether maternal exposure to these drugs influences the development of opioid systems. We have studied the effect of maternal diazepam treatment on stress-induced antinociception in the neonatal offspring. Diazepam (1 or 10 mg/kg) was administered twice daily to mothers from conception. Pre- and postweanling rat pups were assessed for opioid-mediated stress-induced antinociception by 3-min swimming and measuring nociception using the tail immersion test. In preweanling rats there was stress-induced antinociception in both vehicle- and diazepam-treated animals but in diazepam-treated groups (1 and 10 mg/kg) this was insensitive to reversal by the opioid antagonist naloxone, suggesting that nonopioid systems are operating this response. In postweanling rats a similar insensitivity to naloxone was observed in 1 mg/kg diazepam-treated groups; with 10 mg/kg diazepam there was no significant antinociception. The results suggest that maternal diazepam treatment interferes with the development of stress-mediated responses and that part of this toxicity is due to actions on opioid systems in the CNS.", 
    "55": "Recently, ring A reduced metabolites of naturally occurring steroids have been shown to act as allosteric modulators of GABA-gated chloride ion conductance. Specifically, 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one (allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone; 5 alpha-THDOC) was shown to be a positive allosteric effector. For example, 5 alpha-THDOC enhances the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, among other pharmacological actions. Swim stress has been shown to reduce the ability of flurazepam, a prototypic benzodiazepine agonist, to antagonize the electrical precipitation of tonic hindlimb extension in mice. This stress-induced reduction in flurazepam's antiseizure efficacy persists for up to 72 h and is associated with alterations in the specific binding of ligands to the GABAA receptor complex. In the current study, the potentiation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 5 alpha-THDOC was greater in cerebral cortical membranes prepared from stressed mice compared with unstressed controls. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of 5 alpha-THDOC that were ineffective in potentiating the specific binding of [35S]TBPS in cerebral cortical membranes prepared from unstressed control mice were capable of potentiating this binding in membranes prepared from stressed animals. Specifically, 50 nM 5 alpha-THDOC caused a 23% increase in the specific binding of [35S]TBPS in membranes from stressed mice, whereas it was without any significant effect in unstressed controls. This apparent ability of 5 alpha-THDOC to distinguish between the binding of [35S]TBPS to crude membranes prepared from stressed and unstressed control mice was eliminated in the presence of a 5 microM concentration of GABA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "To ascertain whether behavioral effects of benzodiazepines are altered by exposure to microwave radiation, we compared the performance of male, Swiss CD1 mice in the staircase test 30 min after pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide (8, 16, and 32 mg/kg, IP) and immediately following a 5-min exposure to microwave radiation (4, 12, and 36 W/kg, continuous wave, 1.8 or 4.7 GHz). In this paradigm, chlordiazepoxide reduction in the number of rears (NR) and number of steps ascended (NSA) is postulated to reflect anxiolytic and sedative drug effects, respectively. In sham-exposed mice, increasing doses of chlordiazepoxide increased NSA without affecting NR, increased NSA and decreased NR, then decreased both NSA and NR. Microwave exposure generally did not alter NSA or NR in mice pretreated with lower doses of chlordiazepoxide. However, in mice pretreated with 32 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide, exposure to 36 W/kg microwave radiation significantly reversed the reductions in NSA and NR at 4.7 GHz but not at 1.8 GHz. These findings indicate that exposure to microwave radiation can selectively alter effects of chlordiazepoxide in this psychopharmacological paradigm.", 
    "57": "Acute treatment with diazepam (2 mg/kg) decreased locomotor activity, rearing, and the number of head dips made in a holeboard. After 3 days of diazepam treatment, tolerance developed to the decreases in locomotor activity and the number of head dips, and there was an emergence of an increased time spent head dipping, compared with controls. Two days of concomitant treatment with the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg) blocked the development of tolerance and the increased time spent head dipping. In some respects, the effects of dizocilpine resembled those of holeboard experience. Thus, the rats tested daily in the holeboard after diazepam treatment showed significantly less tolerance to the decrease in locomotor activity and did not show enhanced time spent head dipping after 3 days of treatment. Possible similarities between changes induced by experience and those occurring during the development of tolerance are discussed.", 
    "58": "Droperidol and diazepam were evaluated for sedative properties in 12 male Sprague Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus). Over a period of several weeks, each rat was treated subcutaneously with 0.5 mg droperidol/kg, 2.0 mg droperidol/kg, 5.0 mg diazepam/kg, 15.0 mg diazepam/kg, and physiologic saline according to a randomized schedule. After each treatment, the animals were evaluated for their response to a series of four common clinical manipulations (tail-vein bleeding, orbital bleeding, teeth clipping, and toenail bleeding) at five time points over the 90 min following the injection. Rats were scored on the basis of their responses to each manipulation. Response to cardiac puncture was assessed once in each animal immediately prior to euthanasia. Histologic lesions associated with subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of these drugs were evaluated in a separate group of animals. Results indicate that both droperidol and diazepam (at either dose) allow easier manipulation for toenail bleeding and teeth clipping when compared with saline control. There was no advantage in using these sedatives for tail-vein bleeding. Orbital bleeding could not be performed humanely with either drug. Diazepam at a dose of 15.0 mg/kg allowed humane cardiac puncture. Subcutaneous injection of diazepam or 2.0 mg droperidol/kg resulted in various degrees of inflammation revealed by histologic examination, although no clinical signs were associated with these lesions. Subcutaneous administration of droperidol at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg is recommended for nonpainful, noninvasive manipulations as it provides adequate sedation for most procedures without inducing the subcutaneous inflammation observed with diazepam or 2.0 mg droperidol/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The ameliorative effects of nefiracetam on apomorphine-induced, but not chlordiazepoxide-induced impairment of latent learning were antagonized by scopolamine. These results provide further evidence that nefiracetam has anti-amnesic effects.

Nifedipine (0.001-0.1 microM), verapamil (0.01-1 microM), diltiazem (0.01-1 microM), cinnarizine (1-100 microM), and trifluoperazine (1-100 microM) each produced a concentration-related inhibition of the log concentration-effect curve for CaCl2. The rank order of potencies of these antagonists, measured as the IC50 against Ca2+ (25 mM)-induced contraction of depolarized bladder, was nifedipine (0.01 microM) > diltiazem (0.36 microM) approximately verapamil (0.41 microM) > or = cinnarizine (2.57 microM) > trifluoperazine (17.4 microM). These antagonists depressed KCl-induced contractions with an effectiveness and potency similar to that displayed against CaCl2-induced contractions. Nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem but not cinnarizine and trifluoperazine had a preferential inhibitory effect on the contractions elicited by KCl when compared to those elicited by acetylcholine. Ro 5-4864, diazepam, midazolam and the non-benzodiazepine PK 11195, each at 1-100 microM, depressed CaCl2- and KCl-induced contractions (IC50 values in the micromolar range). Benzodiazepines and PK 11195, all at 100 microM, markedly depressed acetylcholine-induced contractions. Flumazenil was scarcely effective. Cinnarizine (100 microM) and trifluoperazine (100 microM), but not the other Ca2+ channel antagonists and benzodiazepine receptor ligands tested, depressed Ca2+ (20 microM)-evoked contractions of skinned bladder. It is concluded that the action of nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem is restricted to the plasmalemma whereas cinnarizine and trifluoperazine also act on the intracellular contractile apparatus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "During a 5-month period, 18 (8%) of 212 patients admitted to a psychiatric unit affiliated to a teaching hospital were found to have a catatonic syndrome associated with various nonorganic mental disorders. Signs and symptoms of motor retardation predominated the clinical presentations. In the course of a prospective, open study, all 18 patients were challenged by a small dose of oral lorazepam or intramuscular diazepam. Catatonic signs and symptoms in 2 patients showed an immediate, complete, and sustained response to the medication. The remaining 16 patients were maintained on 1 of the 2 benzodiazepines for the next 48 h when their motor status was re-evaluated. Significant clinical improvement was detected in all but 2 patients. However, 9 patients needed electroconvulsive treatment to achieve further improvement. Short-term benzodiazepine administration proved to be a safe and effective treatment of the catatonic syndrome.", 
    "63": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of toxic agents in attempted and completed suicides. The purpose was also to explore the sources of the drugs taken by suicide attempters. Verbal information on drug intake was collected from 280 suicide attempters during 1987-1990 in the Lund-Orup catchment area. Information on the sources of the drugs was collected from 143 of these attempters. The study also includes toxicological screening from 73 fatal poisonings in southern Sweden during 1989. According to verbal information, the most common drugs used by suicide attempters were benzodiazepines (51%), analgesics (29%) and antidepressants (20%). In suicide attempters, diazepam and levomepromazine were reported more than expected from prescription data. Toxicological screenings of fatal poisonings showed that benzodiazepines were most common (55%), followed by analgesics (38%), mainly propoxyphene (29%) and antidepressants (30%), mainly amitriptyline (22%). Amitriptyline and diazepam were more commonly detected in completed suicides than expected from prescription data. The most common sources of drugs to attempted suicides were physicians, and especially psychiatrists. We therefore conclude that continuous information to physicians on drug overdose is important, and it is also important to introduce alternative strategies to prevent suicidal behaviour.", 
    "64": "We have studied the sedation achieved with a mixture of midazolam (0.56 mg/kg-1) and ketamine (5 mg/kg-1) administered nasally in 30 children weighing less than 16 kg undergoing computerised tomography. Assessment was two fold using a visual analogue scale; the radiologist/radiographer rated the exam from \"failed examination\" to \"perfect working conditions\" while the anesthetist's assessment ranged from \"poor sedation\" to \"perfect sedation with clinical well being\". This new method proved to be effective alone in 83% of the cases and there were no complications. The rapid onset obtained after intranasal midazolam and ketamine offers advantages over orally or rectally administered drugs. The absence of respiratory depression and oxygen desaturation suggests that this technique is safe and efficient in the CT room with its particular working conditions.", 
    "65": "General anaesthetics depress swallowing and this is a reason to delay oral intake after general anaesthesia. The swallowing reflex was studied 2 h after general anaesthesia for patients undergoing colonoscopy. Forty-one patients were anaesthetized with midazolam 75 micrograms.kg-1 followed by a continuous infusion of propofol and 39 patients with propofol 1.5 mg.kg-1 bolus followed by an infusion. Swallowing reflex was measured by electromyography 2 h after induction of anaesthesia, before and 5 min after the administration of flumazenil (0.2 mg) or placebo. Two h after anaesthesia, the state of consciousness was almost normal in all patients and did not change after flumazenil. At two hours, the latency times for the swallowing reflex in patients treated with propofol alone were of 1.4 +/- 0.4 s and were significantly shorter (P < 0.05) than the value of 1.9 +/- 0.8 s observed in patients who received midazolam with propofol. In the latter group the latency time of the swallowing reflex was significantly reduced following the administration of flumazenil but not placebo. In patients who received propofol without midazolam, the administration of flumazenil or placebo was not associated with significant changes in the latency times. There were also no significant differences in the latency times in the subgroup that received midazolam followed by flumazenil and the propofol alone groups that did or did not receive flumazenil. These results suggest that midazolam still exerts a depressive effect on the swallowing reflex 2 h after its administration despite the recovery of normal consciousness.",

The revision combined several aspects of client behavior into one graph that could aid clinicians in assessing a client under psychiatric care. Revised applications of the graph should also enable clinicians to measure and display not just incidents of maladaptive behaviors but weighted maladaptive behaviors, adaptive behaviors, potency of medication, and side effects, all of which provide a better overall picture of the client's behavior.",

Ketamine-midazolam combination was administered to dogs on 3 occasions to determine effects of prior administration of IV administered saline solution (1 ml), butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg), or oxymorphone (0.1 mg/kg). The infusion rate of ketamine and midazolam was decreased by 25% for anesthetic maintenance after opioid administration. There were no significant differences in cardiorespiratory variables after saline solution or butorphanol administration; however, oxymorphone caused significant (P < 0.05) increases in mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and breathing rate. Bolus administration of ketamine-midazolam combination after saline solution caused significant (P < 0.05) increases in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac index, mean pulmonary blood pressure, venous admixture, and significant decreases in stroke index, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, arterial and mixed venous oxygen tension, arterial oxygen content, and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. Opioid administration was associated with significantly (P < 0.05) lower values than was saline administration for heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and arterial and mixed venous pH and with higher values for stroke index, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and arterial and mixed venous carbon dioxide tension. Prior oxymorphone administration resulted in the highest (P < 0.05) values for mean pulmonary blood pressure, venous admixture, and arterial and mixed venous carbon dioxide tension, and the lowest values for arterial oxygen tension, and arterial and mixed venous pH. Each treatment provided otherwise uncomplicated anesthetic induction, maintenance, and recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The choice of treatment in alcohol withdrawal syndromes (clomethiazole, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics or clonidine) is still a subject of dispute. After administration of ethanol, the CNS shows significant short and long-term changes in a number of transmitter-systems (e.g. noradrenaline, GABA, glutamate, dopamine), which--at least partially--explain the variety of symptoms in alcohol withdrawal and may indicate a correlation between the symptoms and the transmitter systems affected. An optimal drug would have to meet a wide range of criteria, combining good antiadrenergic, anticonvulsive and antipsychotic properties with a high margin of therapeutic safety and good controllability. With respect to monotherapy, clomethiazole and to a lesser degree also benzodiazepines are most likely to fulfil these criteria, both theoretically and in the light of comparative studies. Combined therapy has some advantages in theory, but is not yet backed by sufficient empirical evidence. We recommend a graduation of therapy according to the severity of withdrawal symptoms, starting with adjuvant measures and orally administered clomethiazole, while i.v. application of clomethiazole on an ICU is necessary in fully developed delirium tremens. Additional therapy with potent neuroleptics is reasonable, if psychotic symptoms persist. Other combinations may be applied in individual cases according to the prevailing symptoms.", 
    "69": "This study examines clinical predictors of outcome for patients with panic disorder and depression in a 16 week, placebo-controlled trial of alprazolam and imipramine (n = 126). Baseline global severity of illness and phobic avoidance were differentially predictive of acute response to treatment. Patients in the mild to moderate range of global distress experienced smaller degrees of improvement on alprazolam than on imipramine at week 4. At endpoint, the relative effectiveness of the active medication versus placebo was diminished in patients with higher levels of phobic avoidance. This relationship was not evident for completers, suggesting that the adverse effects of avoidance on outcome after sustained treatment was reduced.",

    "77": "A modified thin-layer chromatographic method with fluorescence detection is described for the screening of flunitrazepam and its major metabolites in urine. The method is based on the hydrolysis and subsequent formation of acridine derivatives by cyclization in dimethyl-formamide. This reliable screening procedure, which has proven its usefulness in many laboratories, provides valid results in the absence of diclofenac, carbamazepine, and tricyclic antidepressants. On the other hand these latter substances are frequently detectable in urine samples taken from addicts especially during therapy. So it was necessary to modify the procedure.", 
    "78": "The use of high-performance liquid chromatography for therapeutic drug monitoring of clonazepam has previously been limited by low sensitivity and labor-intensive liquid-liquid extractions. The present method was developed employing a rapid solid-phase extraction, thus minimising sample workup and providing analytical sensitivity down to 2 micrograms/L using 1 ml of plasma. Plasma samples were loaded onto C18 solid-phase extraction columns, and clonazepam and its internal standard (methyl-clonazepam) were eluted with methanol, dried, and reconstituted in 130 microliters of mobile phase. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a 3-microns RP18 column at 40 degrees C and a mobile phase of 32% acetonitrile and 0.5% glacial acetic acid in distilled water at 0.5 ml/min. Detection was carried out using ultraviolet absorbance at 306 nm. Retention times for clonazepam and methyl-clonazepam were approximately 7 and 12 min respectively. Standard curves were linear over a range of 5-200 micrograms/L with intraassay coefficients of variation of 1.2 and 4.8% at 200 and 5 micrograms/L, respectively. Plasma concentrations measured in patient samples were not statistically different from those obtained using an established gas chromatographic method, and quality control specimens from the Heathcontrol EQA Scheme were consistently within +/- 1.2 SD of the group means. There was no chromatographic interference from other benzodiazepines or other drugs used for the treatment of epilepsy.", 
    "79": "This report describes the first evaluation in humans of CL 284,846, a non-benzodiazepine compound with a preclinical profile indicative of sedative/hypnotic properties. Healthy, normal male volunteers were assigned randomly to receive single oral doses of 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 mg of CL 284,846 or placebo on a double-blind basis. Observations were made over the subsequent 25 hours to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and psychometric effects of the test compound. CL 284,846 was well tolerated in the normal volunteers, causing no significant changes in vital signs, EEG, ECG, hematologic, or clinical chemistry laboratory parameters. Although few adverse events were noted at doses less than 60 mg, at the highest dose (60 mg), all volunteers reported transient neurologically related adverse events (e.g., impaired concentration, difficulty focusing, and impaired coordination), reflecting the central nervous system action of the compound. Although determination of hypnotic efficacy was not an objective in this Phase I study, daytime treatment with 60 mg of CL 284,846 was associated with greater reports of drowsiness and impaired performance on psychomotor tests. However, memory, as assessed by a word recall test, was not affected at any dose of the compound. Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed CL 284,846 to be absorbed and eliminated rapidly (Tmax = 0.9-1.5 hr, T 1/2 = 0.9-1.1 hr), with a dose-proportional AUC (area under cure). Plasma levels of CL 284,859, the primary desethylated metabolite of CL 284,846, were much lower in humans than in other species, indicating that the metabolism of CL 284,846 in humans may differ from that of rodents and dogs. Overall, CL 284,846 was well tolerated, and the authors recommend repeating dose safety and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers.",

Polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing excluded cataplexy, which can be confused with startle attacks. A new imaging finding was a nuclear tomography abnormality in the left frontal lobe. We postulate that this finding may represent a functional cortical lesion of a descending pathway that normally inhibits the startle reflex. Serious complications of pharmacotherapy with clonazepam, the drug of choice for hyperekplexia, can be avoided by first evaluating for OSA.",

Urine drug level data are reported for drugs of abuse (opioid, amphetamines, cocaine) as well as therapeutic drugs (benzodiazepines and methadone). Clinical uses of quantitation illustrated include screening of all admissions prior to induction on methadone, identification of unusually heavy users, monitoring drug washout, and assessing compliance with prescribed benzodiazepine and methadone regimens.

The intramuscular administration of medetomidine-midazolam caused a pressor response, characterized by a rapid increase in arterial and pulmonary arterial pressure mediated mainly through systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction. These pressures decreased after reaching a peak 5 to 10 min after the administration of sedatives, but maintained higher values than the base-line. However, all these changes caused by medetomidine-midazolam were within the physiological fluctuation. In addition, this combination did not induce bradycardia, subsequent hypotension or a significant decrease in cardiac output, which were generally observed with alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, and caused fewer changes in the respiratory system. The administration of atipamezole resulted in a marked transient decrease in vascular resistance, and caused a decrease in blood pressure and increases in cardiac output and heart rate. However, these changes were relatively small and sustained for a short time. Thus the combination of medetomidine-midazolam and atipamezole have minimal cardiopulmonary effects and might be used safely in laboratory pigs.", 
    "85": "In clinical or forensic practice there are few studies assessing which risk factors are associated with heroin overdoses. A series of 76 consecutive non-fatal heroin overdoses were compared to 22 consecutive subjects who self-injected heroin within 1 h before admission to the emergency room. Whereas blood levels of alcohol and IgE and urinary cocaine metabolite levels were similar in both groups, higher benzodiazepine plasma levels were detected in the heroin overdose group. The assessment of methadone, dextropropoxyphene, amphetamines and cannabis in urine analysis did not show differences between both groups. The interview revealed that only 48% of subjects in the heroin overdose group self-administered the last dose of heroin before admission in the usual setting as compared to 100% of subjects in the non-overdose group. The application of a log-linear regression model identified self-injection of heroin in an unusual place and plasma concentrations of total morphine and benzodiazepines as risk factors for heroin overdose.", 
    "86": "Distribution dialysis was used to study binding competition between homogenates of adipose tissue and of lean tissues. The concentration ratios adipose/X (X = blood, muscle, lung, liver) of eight lipophilic drugs were determined in the absence and in the presence of a competing binding system X. With drugs which do not undergo storage in adipose tissue in-vivo, yet have a high volume of distribution, such as imipramine or desipramine, there was strong binding competition, and the balance of distribution was shifted from adipose to lean tissues. In the case of indomethacin with a low volume of distribution this shift was from adipose tissue to blood. With diazepam there was a marked binding competition which was not, however, sufficient to shift the balance of distribution away from adipose tissue. Binding competition was negligible with thiopentone. In contrast, with the equally lipophilic hexethal a moderate binding competition was observed. This is consistent with a decreased adipose tissue storage of the latter barbiturate. It is concluded that binding competition exists not only between blood and tissues but also among individual tissues. It is suggested that occurrence and extent of adipose tissue storage of drugs are determined by binding competition between lean and adipose tissues and, more generally, that distribution of lipophilic drugs is largely a function of binding competition.", 
    "87": "High affinity receptors for peripheral benzodiazepines (PBD) are present within the pituitary gland. Whether these receptors influence cell growth, mitochondrial morphology and secretion of growth hormone was examined in pituitary tumour GH3 cells. Cells were incubated in medium with either 10% calf serum, or serum free medium, or serum free medium plus 10 nM of selective PBD ligands (PK11195 or Ro5-4864) or a central benzodiazepine ligand (clonazepam). Peripheral or central ligands had no effect on cell growth. Quantitative electron micrography, however, revealed that cells treated with PBDs had a 2.5-fold increase in the total mitochondrial area within cells, a 1.6-fold increase in the number of mitochondria, and a 2.0 to 2.7-fold increase on the number of dividing mitochondria compared to serum free controls. The activity of DNA polymerase gamma, which replicates mitochondrial DNA, was increased approximately 3 times the initial value after 6 h exposure to PBDs. The number of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), which relate to the ultimate synthesis of cellular protein, showed a 1.4-fold increase in PBDs treated cells. Secretion of growth hormone was stimulated (240% of serum free control) by exposure to PBDs for 12 h. The central benzodiazepine ligand, clonazepam, had little effect on mitochondrial morphology or secretion of growth hormone. These findings suggest that PBD receptors may be involved in mitochondrial proliferation and may affect the secretion of pituitary hormones.", 
    "88": "1. The pharmacological properties of a benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) partial agonist, Y-23684 were investigated in comparison with those of diazepam, a conventional BZR full agonist. 2. Y-23684 and diazepam showed high and selective affinity for the BZR with Ki values of 41 and 5.8 nM, respectively. 3. In contrast to diazepam, variability was noted in the anticonvulsive potency of Y-23684 depending on convulsants (bicuculline, pentylenetetrazol and maximal electrical shock). Y-23684 produced the most potent protective effect against bicuculline in rats and mice with ED50S of 1.3 and 1.2 mg kg-1, respectively. 4. In rat conflict models (Geller-Seifter and water-lick tests), Y-23684 produced an antipunishment action at doses 2-4 times lower than diazepam. In contrast to diazepam, Y-23684 did not affect unpunished responding up to 50 mg kg-1 in the Geller-Seifter test. 5. In other rat models of anxiety (social interaction and elevated plus-maze tests), Y-23684 was as efficacious as and ten fold more potent than diazepam. In a mouse model of anxiety (exploration (light/dark box) test), Y-23684 was as efficacious and two fold less potent as diazepam. In these paradigms, Y-23684 showed a selective anxiolytic profile over a wide dose-range without loss of efficacy and sedative action. 6. The impairment of motor coordination (rotarod) and potentiation of CNS depressants (ethanol and hexobarbitone) by Y-23684 was much weaker than that of diazepam. 7. These results suggest that Y-23684 would be a potent and selective anxiolytic agent in man with less side-effects than conventional BZ-anxiolytics.", 
    "89": "Treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is the first step towards the rehabilitation of alcohol-dependent patients. The objectives of treatment are relief of symptoms, prevention of complications and a smooth transition into a long-term rehabilitation programme. Recently, progress has been made in the clinical management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome through standardization of the assessment using the CIWA-A scale and frequent monitoring of clinical findings, recognition of the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions (i.e. standardized supportive care) and simplification of pharmacotherapy by optimizing the use of long-acting benzodiadepines via a loading dose technique. Benzodiazepines, because of their cross-tolerance with ethanol, wide margin of safety and low potential for physical dependence and tolerance, are very effective and are the drugs of choice for the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "90": "Sedation, anxiolysis, intubation responses and fentanyl anaesthetic requirements were investigated in a double-blind, randomized study in twenty ASA I-II elective hysterectomy patients. Ten patients received dexmedetomidine 2.5 micrograms kg-1 i.m. 60 min before induction and saline placebo i.v. 2 min prior to induction (= DP group). Ten patients received midazolam 0.08 mg kg-1 i.m. 60 min and fentanyl 1.5 micrograms kg-1 i.v. (= MF group) 2 min before induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone 4 mg kg-1. Anaesthesia was maintained with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and with fentanyl 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v. increments according to predetermined criteria. Both premedications induced sedation (P < 0.01 in both groups) and anxiolysis (P < 0.01 in DP vs P < 0.05 in MF group) without any differences between the groups. Haemodynamic changes following tracheal intubation did not significantly differ between the groups. Intraoperatively systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 15% and 13% lower in DP group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 for drug effect), the mean heart rate was approximately 9 beats min-1 lower in DP group (n.s.). Fentanyl was required more often in MF group: median 3.5 (QD 1.5) vs. 2.5 (QD 0.5) times in DP group (P < 0.05), the total amount being 57% smaller in DP group: 0.03 (QD 0.01) vs. 0.07 (QD 0.02) micrograms kg-1 min-1 (P < 0.05). Postoperative course and analgesic requirements were similar in both groups. Dexmedetomidine premedication may offer an alternative to current anaesthesia practice in elective hysterectomy.",

Compared to the diazepam patients, a larger number of the dixyrazine medicated patients appeared anxious, and there was a statistically significant difference between the groups, when summing up changes in anxiety throughout the study period. The dixyrazine patients needed more frequent supplementation with intravenous sedative drugs, compared with their diazepam counterparts. Peroral dixyrazine is an applicable choice for calm patients, when only slight sedation, or avoidance of somnolence are required.",

The patients treated with melperon needed significantly fewer supplementations with intravenous drugs, to withstand the surgery, compared to those medicated with diazepam. Melperon is a compatible alternative, but its possible propensity to cause occasional arterial hypotension must be noticed.",

    "96": "Regulation of benzodiazepine prescriptions appeared to significantly disrupt the treatment of some patients and to encourage them to seek treatment in a psychiatric setting. The high frequency of mood disorders among these patients suggests that some patients may have been misdiagnosed earlier as having anxiety disorder and raises questions about the appropriateness of their previous use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "97": "The neuropharmacologic basis of infantile spasms and the mechanism by which adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) exerts its therapeutic effects are unknown. This is a critical review of cerebrospinal fluid neurotransmitters or their metabolites in infantile spasms before and during treatment with ACTH, and of clinical drug trials with drugs acting on neurotransmission. Cerebrospinal fluid studies have shown lower gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), ACTH, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in patients with infantile spasms compared to controls, elevated lysine and glutamate, variable or no differences in homovanillic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, norepinephrine, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and beta-endorphin. Chronic treatment with ACTH in infantile spasms reduces cerebrospinal fluid GABA, beta-endorphin, and somatostatin, increases norepinephrine and tyrosine, and has variable or no effect on homovanillic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, histamine, and tryptophan. Small therapeutic trials with drugs that act through different neurotransmitters such as methysergide, alpha-methylparatyrosine, various benzodiazepine agonists, and vigabatrin lend some support to a role for GABA and monoamines in infantile spasms. These data, though promising, provide only a hint of potential neurotransmitter disturbances, and more basic and clinical data are needed.", 
    "98": "Whole-cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings were used to investigate the nature of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition in the adult rat dentate gyrus in standard 400-microns-thick horizontal slices. In the presence of the glutamate receptor antagonists D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments with chloride-filled electrodes ([Cl-]in = [Cl-]out) revealed a high degree of spontaneous activity (10-60 Hz) in all hilar neurons (HNs) recorded with access resistances lower than 20 M omega. The events were inward at negative holding potentials, reversed at around the Cl- equilibrium potential, and were completely abolished by the specific antagonists of the GABAA receptor channel picrotoxin and SR-95531 in a reversible manner, indicating that they were spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) mediated by GABAA receptors. The majority of the sIPSCs were TTX-insensitive miniature currents resulting from the action potential-independent release of GABA. The 10-90% rise times and the monoexponential decay time constants of the sIPSCs were significantly longer in HNs than those found in neighboring granule cells (GCs). Furthermore, the decay time constant of the hilar sIPSCs was not voltage dependent, contrary to the voltage dependency of the decay time constant of the sIPSCs recorded from GCs. As HNs have longer electrotonic length than GCs do, dendritic filtering may contribute to the kinetic differences. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis showed that whereas the number of channels open at the peak of individual sIPSCs was similar, the single-channel conductances significantly differed between the two cell groups. The 21% smaller single-channel conductance and the existence of electrotonically close GABAergic synapses on HNs indicate that dendritic filtering alone cannot explain the differences between HNs and GCs. The distinct subunit composition of the GABAA receptor channels in HNs and GCs may also be responsible for the altered kinetics of IPSCs in HNs. However, the subunit specific benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem (3 microns) prolonged the monoexponential decay time constants in both HNs and GCs. Thus, differences between the GABAA receptors of the two cell types are not due to a simple all-or-none presence/absence of the alpha 5 subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "99": "The effect of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466) on ischaemia-induced changes in the microdialysate and tissue concentrations of glutamate, aspartate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was studied in rats. Twenty minutes of four-vessel occlusion resulted in a transient increase in microdialysate levels of glutamate, aspartate, and GABA in striatum, cortex, and hippocampus. Administration of GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg bolus + 10 mg/kg/60 min intravenously starting 20 min before onset of ischaemia) inhibited ischaemia-induced increases in microdialysate glutamate and GABA in striatum without affecting the increases in hippocampus or cortex. Twenty minutes of four-vessel occlusion resulted in immediate small decreases and larger delayed (72 h) decreases in tissue levels of glutamate and aspartate. Transient increases in tissue levels of GABA were shown in all three structures at the end of the ischaemic period. At 72 h, after the ischaemic period, significantly reduced GABA levels were observed in striatum and hippocampus. GYKI 52466, given under identical conditions as above, augmented the ischaemia-induced decrease in striatal tissue levels of glutamate and aspartate, without significantly affecting the decreases in hippocampus and cortex. Twenty minutes of ischaemia resulted in a large increase in microdialysate dopamine in striatum. GYKI 52466 failed to inhibit this increase. Kainic acid (500 microM infused through the probe for 20 min) caused increases in microdialysate glutamate and aspartate in the striatum. GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg bolus + 10 mg/kg/60 min) completely inhibited the kainic acid-induced glutamate release. In conclusion, the action of the non-NMDA antagonist, GYKI 52466, in the striatum is different from that in the cortex and hippocampus. The inhibition by GYKI 52466 of ischaemia-induced and kainate-induced increases in microdialysate glutamate concentration in the striatum may be related to the neuroprotection provided by GYKI 52466 in this region.", 
    "100": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used to quantify the effects of 1. sedation and 2. general anaesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in place on the minimum antero-posterior (A-P) diameters of the naso-, oro- and hypopharynx and on the angle of the epiglottis relative to the adjacent posterior pharyngeal wall. Median sagittal T1-weighted images of the pharynx were obtained in 46 patients (16 awake, 14 sedated, 16 under general anaesthesia). In sedated patients, the A-P diameters of the pharynx were less than in awake patients, in particular at the levels of the epiglottis and soft palate. General anaesthesia and placement of a LMA was also associated with a reduced A-P diameter at the level of the soft palate, but with increased diameters at the levels of the tongue and epiglottis. Placement of a LMA caused abnormal downfolding of the epiglottis in most cases but this did not cause clinically significant airway obstruction.", 
    "101": "In a multicentre study, 145 adult Nigerian patients presenting with diverse conditions (falling into ASA1 or ASA2 classification) for short surgical procedures (< 1 hour) were given either midazolam (0.15-0.20 mg/kg) or thiopentone (4-6 mg/kg) intravenously for induction of anaesthesia. Study population consisted of 58 male and 89 female patients with a mean age of 33.5 +/- 10.42 years. The primary efficacy criteria for induction of anaesthesia was induction time measured by the time of spontaneous closing of eyes and disappearance of palpebral reflexes following injection of trial drug. For maintenance of anaesthesia efficacy was assessed by the requirement of an additional dose of the anaesthetic agent either alone or in combination with other agents in addition to N20/O2 mixture. The secondary efficacy criteria was the degree of anterograde amnesia produced by trial drug, this was assessed by memory test. Safety was assessed by the frequency of the incidence of apnoea and cardio-stability measured by changes in the haemodynamic parameters (BP and pulse). Tolerability was evaluated by incidence of phlebitis or pain at the injection site. The standard efficacy population was all the 145 patients while only 100 patients were considered evaluable for maintenance efficacy. The mean induction time was 67.28 +/- 63.36 secs and 31.28 +/- 13.01 secs for the midazolam and thiopentone groups respectively. Anaesthesia was maintained with N20/O2 alone in 47% of patients in the midazolam group compared with 28.6% of patients in the thiopentone group. The degree of anterograde amnesia was significantly more pronounced in the midazolam group than in the thiopentone group (p = 0.000).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "102": "The effectiveness and safety of midazolam in induction of anaesthesia was studied in 15 ASA class II or III patients who required emergency surgery. In each case a slower and smoother transition at induction of anaesthesia was desired, as well as cardiovascular stability. All patients received 0.5 mg atropine and midazolam premedication (10-12.5 mg i.m) 20 to 30 minutes before induction. Anaesthesia was induced with 0.2 mg/kg of midazolam administered intravenously over 30 seconds. The induction time, degree of anterograde amnesia and incidence of local tolerance were evaluated. The pulse rate, blood pressure and ECG were monitored and recorded throughout the duration of surgery. The recovery time was also assessed. The mean induction time was 82.73 seconds and transition was smooth in all cases. Tolerability was good as well as the amnestic effect. Outcome was rated as very good in terms of cardiovascular stability and all the patients recovered rapidly.", 
    "103": "In a pilot survey, 11 female patients of ASA grade I, undergoing short elective surgery, received midazolam 0.5 to 0.2 mg/kg for induction of anaesthesia. Indication for surgery was therapeutic or diagnostic evacuations. No narcotic premedication was given, however atropine 0.5 mg i.v. was given at induction just before pre-oxygenation. Anaesthesia was maintained with N20/O2 and halothane 1-3% and ventilation was spontaneous. The study showed that although midazolam did not produce narcosis as rapidly as thiopentone it was devoid of any marked respiratory or cardiovascular depressant effect. Narcosis was however induced within 81 seconds of injection. Midazolam also exhibited an additional anxiolytic effect. No local or system adverse reaction were observed on the day of surgery. There was no incidence of apnoea and no case of post operative vomiting. There was marked anterograde amnesia, only 20% of the patients had some recall of events preceeding induction (just about 30% of events could be remembered). It was therefore concluded that in view of the foregoing, combined with the fact that midazolam injection was painless, recovery rapid and amnesic properties good, midazolam is a drug of choice for day stay surgery.", 
    "104": "Seven healthy normal male and female volunteers (21-31 years) were trained to discriminate between the benzodiazepine triazolam (0.32 mg/70 kg, PO; e.g., drug A) and placebo (e.g., drug B) under a three-choice, instructed novel response drug discrimination procedure. Once the criterion for discrimination was met (i.e., > 85% correct responding on four consecutive sessions), dose-effect curves were determined for triazolam (0.1-0.56 mg/70 kg), the benzodiazepine diazepam (10-32 mg/70 kg) and the opioid agonist hydromorphone (1-6 mg/70 kg). Subjects met the criterion for discrimination within four to six sessions. Triazolam and diazepam produced dose-related increases in triazolam-appropriate responding and no novel-appropriate responding at any dose tested. In contrast, hydromorphone generally increased novel-appropriate responding in a dose-related manner with placebo-appropriate responding and some triazolam-appropriate responding at intermediate doses occurring also. Triazolam and diazepam produced qualitatively similar increases on several measures of sedative drug effects; hydromorphone increased ratings of \"like novel\" and sedative-like effects in subjects who discriminated hydromorphone as novel relative to those who did not. These results indicate that the novel response drug discrimination procedure enhances the specificity of the triazolam-placebo discrimination.", 
    "105": "Human serum albumin is known to have two major and selective drug binding sites, termed sites I and II. The fluorescent probes, dansylamide and dansylsarcosine selectively interact with sites I and II, respectively. However, the binding site of the fluorescent probe dansylglycine on human serum albumin is not clear from the literature. This study investigated whether dansylglycine interacts tightly with site I or II. Spectrofluorimetric titrations (quenching and complex) and circular dichroism measurements were performed to determine the binding characteristics of dansylglycine to human serum albumin. Modification in probe fluorescence was described by fluorescence titrations to be a result of competitive displacement by ligands. The pattern of displacement of this probe by several ligands whose primary binding sites are exactly known, enabled the identification of its specific binding site. The fluorescence of dansylglycine is only extensively changed when ligands of site II are added, suggesting that it strongly interacts with the benzodiazepine/indole binding site on human serum albumin.", 
    "106": "To study the functional properties of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) from intact viral particles without the requirement for tissue culture expansion, a method that couples HIV-1 reverse transcription utilizing its endogenous RT (ERT) with polymerase chain reaction amplification (PCR) was developed. Detection of endogenous reverse transcripts from HIV particles by ERT-PCR was compared to HIV RNA PCR detection using avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT from plasma samples from 45 HIV-1 infected patients. The HIV ERT-PCR method was capable of detecting plasma viremia with the same efficiency (29/29 patients) as the AMV RT HIV RNA PCR in patients with CD4 cell counts of less than 500/mm3. The determination of HIV-RT drug sensitivities using four well-characterized HIV-1 lab strains was assessed. The ERT-PCR method detected reduced sensitivity to TIBO R82150 (10 microM) in a TIBO resistant strain but not in the TIBO sensitive HTLV-IIIB viral mixture or an HTLV-IIIB clone. In summary, the HIV ERT-PCR method provides a useful approach for the detection of HIV and the characterization of RT sensitivities among HIV-1 strains.", 
    "107": "The effect of specific stressful stimuli on neuropeptide levels was studied in rat brain regions known to be involved in the mediation of stress responses and anxiety. Rats were sequentially removed, one by one with 20-min intervals from group cages and immediately decapitated. A selective increase of the somatostatin level was observed in the amygdala in the rats taken for sacrifice second last and last, compared to the rats taken earlier from the respective group cage (increases by 40 to 69%, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Isolation of rats in single cages for 24 h or 1 week before sacrifice, increased the substance P level in the dorsal periaqueductal grey by 26 and 27% (p < 0.05 in both cases), respectively, compared to group housed rats. In group housed rats treated with diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.) 140 min before sacrifice, the level of substance P in the rostral hippocampus and dorsal periaqueductal grey was reduced by 40% (p < 0.001) and 28% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared to saline treated controls. In conclusion, handling, as well as a single dose of the anxiolytic drug diazepam, appears to induce rapid, selective and region-specific changes of regional brain peptide levels in the rat. The effects of handling are likely to be related to the acute stress response and are probably not secondary to increased plasma glucocorticoid levels.", 
    "108": "Psychotropic drugs are frequently employed to treat the wide range of neuropsychiatric syndromes that patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may develop. In order to administer these agents properly, physicians should take certain factors into account: the central nervous systems of these patients are often impaired, the patients tend to suffer from medical illnesses, and they may be taking various other drugs. The possible interactions between substances taken by these patients may sometimes make it necessary to adjust the dosage of psychotropic agents administered. In addition, some of the antimicrobial, antifungal and antiviral agents used in the management of HIV infection may have adverse effects that include neuropsychiatric symptoms. The use of antipsychotic agents in these patients frequently results in the development of extrapyramidal symptoms. Tricyclic antidepressants are not well tolerated by patients with AIDS, due to the anticholinergic effects of these agents. The new antidepressants, which have fewer and milder adverse effects, are safer and have shown their efficacy in the treatment of the depressive episodes often seen in HIV-infected patients. Benzodiazepines must be prescribed with caution in patients with HIV infection and organic brain syndrome, since they can produce amnesia, confusion, lack of inhibition and paradoxical reactions. The indications for the use of psychostimulants in certain clinical situations, such as HIV-associated dementia and depression, is open to debate. Opiates are indicated in pain treatment, and in methadone maintenance programmes. Lithium and carbamazepine are advisable only in very restricted situations."
