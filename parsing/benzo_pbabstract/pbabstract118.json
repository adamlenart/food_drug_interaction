    "0": "Weight gain is increasingly recognized as an unwanted side effect of atypical antipsychotic drugs. To explore the mechanisms underlying this side effect, we examined the effects of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, on cellular proliferation and differentiation in the adult mouse hypothalamus. A 6-week treatment with olanzapine resulted in a significant increase in body weight. The sizes and numbers of olanzapine-treated mouse adipocytes were significantly larger than those of control mice. No significant differences were observed in the levels of blood insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride, leptin, and ghrelin among olanzapine-, haloperidol-treated and control mice with an exception that adiponectin was significantly higher in olanzapine group than control group. Body temperature and the level of uncoupling protein 2 were also comparable between the olanzapine-treated and control groups. We found that the treatment increased BrdU-incorporating cell numbers in the hypothalamus, while the same regimen with haloperidol or control had little effect on cellular proliferation. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry revealed that the majority of the BrdU-positive cells were also Olig2- or APC-positive, indicating that oligodendrocyte-lineage cells were generated in response to olanzapine treatment. Enhancement of hypothalamic cellular proliferation after intracerebroventricular infusion of cytosine arabinoside coincided with elevated food intake and weight gain. These findings suggest a possible link between gliogenesis in the hypothalamus and weight gain following olanzapine treatment.",

The anti-inflammatory effect of both nutritional compositions was mediated through cholecystokinin receptors (p < .01), activation of mesenteric vagal afferents (p < .05), and peripheral nicotinic receptors (p < .05). Lipid-rich nutrition attenuated the inflammatory response at lower dosages than low-lipid nutrition, indicating that enrichment of enteral nutrition with lipid augments the anti-inflammatory potential. Administration of lipid-rich nutrition prevented endotoxin-induced small intestinal epithelium damage and reduced inflammation in the liver and spleen compared with fasted (all p < .01) and low-lipid nutrition controls (all p < .05).",

    "12": "Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid is reported to modulate several neurotransmitter systems like N-methyl-D-aspartate, nitric oxide and serotonin, which modulate convulsions. In addition, it is suggested that Berberis vulgaris may be useful in treatment of convulsion and epilepsy. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of berberine in pentylenetetrazole, maximal electroshock (MES) and kainic acid (KA)-induced convulsions. The latency for development of convulsions and mortality rate was recorded in these models using mice. The results revealed that in MES-induced seizures model, berberine (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased duration of tonic hind limb extension and percent mortality. Moreover, these doses of berberine also protected mice against KA-induced clonic convulsions and decreased mortality. Berberine also protected mice against NMDA-induced turning behavior. Further, the anticonvulsant doses of berberine did not show any signs of motor in-coordination when tested in rotarod test. In conclusion, berberine exhibits anticonvulsant activity by modulating neurotransmitter systems and may find clinical application.", 
    "13": "The effects of benzodiazepines on GABA(A) receptors are dependent largely on the particular \u03b1 subunit isoform that is present in the receptor pentamer. The inclusion of either the \u03b14 or \u03b16 subunit is generally thought to render the receptor insensitive to classical benzodiazepines. We expressed the rat \u03b14\u03b23\u03b32L subtype in Xenopus oocytes and observed that both diazepam and flunitrazepam significantly potentiated GABA-gated currents. This potentiation occurred at nanomolar concentrations similar to those seen at the most abundant \"diazepam-sensitive\" receptor i.e., the \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 subtype. In the \u03b14\u03b23\u03b32L receptor, the effects of diazepam and flunitrazepam were inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the benzodiazepine site antagonists, Ro15-1788 and ZK93426. The presence of the \u03b23 subunit appears to be important for this modulation since diazepam did not affect GABA responses mediated by recombinant \u03b14\u03b21\u03b32L or \u03b14\u03b22\u03b32L receptors. Interestingly, when the \u03b14\u03b23\u03b32L receptor was expressed in HEK293 cells, diazepam and flunitrazepam displaced the relatively non-selective benzodiazepine site ligand, [(3)H]Ro15-4513, only at high concentrations (>10 \u03bcM) demonstrating a lack of high affinity binding for these classical benzodiazepines. Functional studies of the cell-expressed receptors using whole cell recording techniques showed that neither diazepam nor flunitrazepam potentiated GABA-evoked currents although currents were enhanced by nanomolar concentrations of Ro15-4513. These results suggest that the observed benzodiazepine modulation of the \u03b14\u03b23\u03b32L subtype depends on the expression system used and may be specific for expression in Xenopus oocytes.", 
    "14": "Diabetes exacerbates neuronal injury mediated through neurotransmitters deregulation in cerebral cortex. Our study analyzed the neuroprotective effect of curcumin to prevent cortical dysfunction associated with diabetes. Our study revealed decreased gene expression of muscarinic M1, insulin receptor, SOD, choline acetyl transferase and increased gene expression of muscarinic M3, \u03b17-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, acetylcholine esterase and GLUT3 in cerebral cortex of diabetic rats. Curcumin and insulin treatment reversed this altered parameters to near control. Immunohistochemistry studies of muscarinic M1 and M3 confirmed the gene expression at protein level. Decreased novel arm entry of diabetic rats in Y-maze test, improved in treatment group. These results suggest that cholinergic dysfunction, impaired glucose transport and oxidative stress contributes to learning and memory deficits in diabetes and further suggest that antioxidant curcumin has potential therapeutic role in preventing and/or delaying the diabetic complications associated with brain.",

The effects of acute and 3-day Danshen treatment on the pharmacokinetics of a low dose midazolam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were determined in vivo in the rat. Danshen (200 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment decreased midazolam clearance by 16%, with increases in the AUC by 22% and the half-life by 14%. 3-Day Danshen treatment (200 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 3 days decreased the clearance, with increases in the T(1/2) and AUC. The effects of acute and 3-day Danshen on midazolam-induced hypnosis, serum 1'-hydroxy-midazolam to midazolam ratio and hepatic CYP3A protein expression were determined in the rat. Danshen treatments (100-200 mg/kg, i.p. and 200-500 mg/kg, p.o.) increased the sleeping time (p<0.001) produced by a hypnotic dose of midazolam (50 mg/kg, i.p.) without affecting the sleep latency. Serum 1'-hydroxy-midazolam to midazolam ratio after the hypnotic dose of midazolam was decreased after intraperitoneal Danshen treatment (200 mg/kg) but not after oral treatment at up to 500 mg/kg. All the treatment groups with Danshen, after intraperitoneal and oral administration, decreased hepatic CYP3A protein expression (p<0.05) by about 25%. The results confirmed that Danshen had no enzyme inducing effects on rat CYP3A.",

Only the higher dose (20mg/kg, i.p.) of curcumin produced significant antianxiety-like effect in stressed mice. Pre-treatment with aminoguanidine (50mg/kg; i.p.), an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor significantly enhanced the anxiolytic-like effect of curcumin in stressed mice as compared to curcumin and aminoguanidine per se in stressed mice. Pretreatment with 7-nitroindazole (20mg/kg), a neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor did not significantly affect the antianxiety-like response of curcumin in stressed mice as compared to curcumin per se. Restraint stress significantly increased plasma nitrite levels in mice. Curcumin (20mg/kg, i.p.) and aminoguanidine significantly decreased plasma nitrite levels in stressed mice. The combination of aminoguanidine and curcumin significantly decreased the plasma nitrite levels as compared to curcumin and aminoguanidine per se in stressed mice. Curcumin and aminoguanidine did not produce any significant change in brain GABA contents of the animals. Diazepam (2mg/kg) produced significant anxiolytic-like effect only in unstressed mice, but could not exert significant anxiolysis in stressed mice.

Olanzapine was quantified by densitometric analysis at 285 nm. The method was found to give compact bands for the drug (Rf = 0.35 +/- 0.02). The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed a good linear relationship with r2 = 0.9997 in the concentration range of 100-600 ng/band. The method was validated for precision, recovery, repeatability, and robustness as per the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The LOD was found to be 23.90 ng/band, and the LOQ was 91.04 ng/band. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the method is precise, accurate, reproducible, and selective for the analysis of olanzapine. The method was successfully used for the determination of equilibrium solubility and quantification of olanzapine as a bulk drug, in a commercially available preparation, and in in-house developed mucoadhesive microemulsion formulations and solution.",

A case of a 27-year-old man with painful erections after fracturing his sacral, pubic, and ischial bones in a motorbike accident is presented. His painful erections occurred in coitus, masturbation, and morning tumescence. No penile or neural pathology was found to account for the pain. He was treated with diazepam 2\u00a0mg before masturbation for 2\u00a0weeks, when the symptoms disappeared. The possible causes of the problem and its resolution are discussed.", 
    "64": "In China, benzodiazepines are the most frequently observed compounds in cases of drug-facilitated crime. Sensitive, specific, and reproducible methods for the quantitative determination of 18 benzodiazepines in hair have been developed using LC-MS/MS. Fourteen volunteers had ingested a single 1-6mg estazolam tablet. Hair was collected 1 month after administration. All the proximal segments were positive for estazolam. With increased dosage, estazolam can be detected in the 2-4cm segments in some subject's hair. Even some of 4-6cm segments were positive. Hair analysis was applied to two authentic criminal cases. Full-length hair samples collected 5 weeks after the offense were cut into segments of 2cm from the root, analyzed and quantified. The clonazepam concentrations measured in the first two segments for V#1 and V#2 were 15.47 and 11.93pg/mg, respectively. However, both the 4-6cm and the 6-8cm segment of V1# remained positive, while those of V#2 were negative. It needs more substantial guidelines to use segmental hair analysis in drug-facilitated crime.",

One of the compounds of the series 17d showed significant anticancer activity with promising DNA-binding ability and apoptosis caused G0/G1 phase arrest at sub-micromolar concentrations. To ascertain the binding mode and understand the structural requirement of DNA binding interaction, molecular docking studies using GOLD program and more rigorous 2 ns molecular dynamic simulations using Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzman Surface Area (MM-PBSA) approach including the explicit solvent were carried out.

    "66": "Dopamine D(3) receptors (DRsD3) seem to have a pivotal role in mood disorders. Using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the novelty-induced grooming test (NGT), we assessed the responses of DRD3-deficient (D(3)(-/-)) mice to the acute treatment (different testing time) with the anxiolytic drug, diazepam. D(3)(-/-) mice treated with diazepam (0.1 or 0.5mg/kg) exhibited a better behavioral response in the EPM than their wild type (WT). Furthermore, in D(3)(-/-) mice, but not in WT, 1mg/kg diazepam induced anxiolytic effects at all testing times. The contribution of DRsD3 in the anxiolytic effects of diazepam was confirmed by similar results obtained in EPM by using the selective DRD3 antagonist U99194A (10mg/kg) in combination with diazepam, in WT animals. D(3)(-/-) mice treated with diazepam (all doses), also showed a decrease in grooming behavior. However, the [(3)H]flunitrazepam autoradiographic analysis revealed no significant changes in D(3)(-/-) mice compared to WT, suggesting that if \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor GABA(A) changes are involved, they do not occur at the level of binding to benzodiazepine site. These data suggest that D(3)(-/-) mice exhibit low baseline anxiety levels and provide the evidence that the DRD3 is involved in the modulation of benzodiazepine anxiolytic effects.", 
    "67": "Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed progressive morphological brain changes during the course of schizophrenia, and the neurotrophic and neurogenetic effects of atypical antipsychotics are believed to prevent or retard these brain volume reductions. In addition to drug-induced neural stem cell (NSC) activation, transplantation of exogenous NSCs has been proposed as a possible approach to repair the damaged brain in psychiatric disease. NSC transplantation embraces not only neuron replacement but also enhanced neuroprotection of existing neurons with the goal of restoring the impaired brain. However, little is known about the cell-cell interactions of exogenous NSCs with existing neurons, or about their neuroprotective actions especially in psychiatric diseases. In the present study, we used cortical neuron cultures to examine the neurotrophism and neuroprotection of exogenous NSCs against the neuronal damage induced by exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. We also investigated their role in serum/nutrient deprivation stress. The exogenous NSCs exerted neuroprotective effects against both types of apoptotic injuries considered as in vitro schizophrenic disease models. Exogenous NSCs also altered cellular survival signaling in injured neurons by indirect cell-cell contact in an injury-dependent manner. In MK-801 exposure, NSCs increased phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and ERK (p-ERK), both of which were reduced by this stress. While, in serum/nutrient deprivation, NSCs increased p-Akt, but decreased p-ERK which was increased by this damage. Our results demonstrate that exogenous NSCs have anti-apoptotic activities and can rescue cortical neurons by directing cellular survival signaling of neurons into the proper direction, without cell contact.",

After adjustment for musculoskeletal pain, alcohol, smoking habits, and socioeconomic variables, the odds ratio was lowered to 3.1 (2.1-4.6). The analysis of the effect of benzodiazepines and chronic pain individually and in combination suggest that use of benzodiazepines is an even stronger predictor of later opioid use than self-reported chronic pain.",

    "88": "Anxiety disorders and alcohol dependence have a higher co-occurence than expected by chance only. This association has a double origin, as the presence of alcohol dependence increases by 6 the risk of any anxious disorder, and the presence of an anxious disorder multiply by 3 the risk of alcohol-dependence. Interestingly, a large population-based epidemiological study performed 10 years apart clearly showed that anxiety disorders moderatly increase the risk of regular consumption in non-consumers or irregular drinkers (by 70%), does not increase ther risk of abuse in regular drinkers, but has a strong impact on the risk of alcohol dependence while already an abuser (OR = 2.7). Assessing the kinetic of symptoms of anxiety and focusing on some symptoms that are more specific than others (for example nausea, vomiting and/or shaking hands in the morning, all being relieved by the first drink) is helpful. Treating anxiety symptoms in alcohol dependence means, whatever the type of relationship they have, to begin with a detoxification program. Indeed, antidepresants have a larger liver-toxicity in alcohol dependence, and benzodiazepine loose most of their benefits with high level of alcohol consumption. Furthermore, when benzodiazepines are taken with large doses of alcohol, the risk of severe withdrawal symptoms is increased (such as seizures). The same trend could be proposed for psychotherapy, as cognitive behavioural therapy sollicitates a lot executive functions. The neurotoxicity of alcohol explains the damages on executive functions, CBT therefore should have larger efficacy after the detoxification program, helping to reduce the risk of relapse.", 
    "89": "Patients with depression showed a decrease in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid allopregnanolone (ALLO). But antidepressants increased the contents of ALLO in the rat brain. We examined the antidepressant-like effects of infusion of ALLO into the cerebral ventricle, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, or prefrontal cortex of learned helplessness (LH) rats (an animal model of depression). Of these regions, infusions of ALLO into the cerebral ventricle, the CA3 region of hippocampus, or the central region of amygdala exerted antidepressant-like effects. Infusion of ALLO into the hippocampal CA3 region or the central amygdala did not produce memory deficits or locomotor activation in the passive avoidance and open field tests. It is well documented that ALLO exerts its effects through GABA receptors. Therefore, we examined the antagonistic effects of flumazenil (a GABA receptor antagonist) on the antidepressant-like effects of ALLO. Coinfusion of flumazenil with ALLO into the hippocampal CA3 region, but not into the central amygdala, blocked the antidepressant-like effects of ALLO. However, coinfusion of (+)MK801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist), but not cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor), blocked the antidepressant-like effects of ALLO in the central amygdala. These results suggest that ALLO exerts antidepressant-like effects in the CA3 region of hippocampus through the GABA system and in the central region of amygdala, dependently on the activation of the glutamatergic mechanisms.",

There were significant anxiogenic effects of both FG-7142 (3-6 mg/kg) and mCPP (0.5-2mg/kg) on these parameters for SD but not TGR. Diazepam (1mg/kg) increased the number of entries into the open zone in both strains. mCPP reduced this parameter in SD (2mg/kg) and TGR (0.5-2mg/kg). FG-7142 had a similar effect in SD (3-6 mg/kg) and TGR (6 mg/kg). This study showed a significant transgenic effect on SAP. The increased number of SAP seen in TGR could be reduced with diazepam.

Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors have been reported to be involved in the protection of cells against oxygen radical damage. The present study was designed to determine whether Ro5-4864 (a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand) can inhibit isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Male Wistar rats (body weight 150-200g) were administered, isoprenaline (5mg/kg, body weight, subcutaneously) alone or along with Ro5-4864 (0.1 and 0.5mg/kg, body weight, intraperitoneally) once daily for 14days. Control rats received normal saline subcutaneously (1.0ml/kg). Isoprenaline-induced changes in heart weight to body weight ratio, left ventricular wall thickness (M-mode echocardiography and gross morphometry) and myocyte size were significantly prevented by both the doses of Ro5-4864. Ro5-4864 also attenuated isoprenaline-induced increase in interstitial fibrosis, lipid peroxidation and changes in endogenous antioxidants (glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase). Isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy was associated with increased expression of beta myosin heavy chain, which was also prevented by Ro5-4864. This is the first study to demonstrate a salutary effect of Ro5-4864 in experimental cardiac hypertrophy.",

Despite much controversy in the literature on this subject, PBR synthetic ligands (and specifically agonists such as Ro5-4864 and SSR180575) are described as presenting potent anti-apoptotic effect against oxidative stress, TNFalpha- and tamoxifen-induced apoptosis when the PBR ligand is administrated at a low dose, close to the affinity range of the ligand to its receptor. Such anti-apoptotic activity has already been correlated with a protective effect of PBR ligands against ischemia-reperfusion induced tissue dysfunction. Previously, we had shown that SSR180575 is a specific and high affinity PBR ligand of potential interest in pathological cardiovascular, renal and neurodegenerative indications. Beyond its expression in steroid-producing tissues, heart, liver and kidney, the PBR is also known to be highly expressed in blood cells. In this work, we demonstrate by flow cytometry experiments, that SSR180575, at low concentrations, is able to protect polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) against TNFalpha-induced apoptosis in whole blood. Thus, in a new context, SSR180575 again shows potent anti-apoptotic properties. Moreover, TNFalpha- induced PMN apoptosis appears to be a good surrogate marker for determining SSR180575 blood availability and activity in treated patients.",

    "107": "Cardiac glycosides, which inhibit the plasma membrane Na(+) pump, are one of the four categories of drug recommended for routine use to treat heart failure, yet their therapeutic window is limited by toxic effects. Elevated cytoplasmic Na(+) ([Na(+)](i)) compromises mitochondrial energetics and redox balance by blunting mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](m)) accumulation, and this impairment can be prevented by enhancing [Ca(2+)](m). Here, we investigate whether this effect underlies the toxicity and arrhythmogenic effects of cardiac glycosides and if these effects can be prevented by suppressing mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux, via inhibition of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (mNCE). In isolated cardiomyocytes, ouabain elevated [Na(+)](i) in a dose-dependent way, blunted [Ca(2+)](m) accumulation, decreased the NADH/NAD+redox potential, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Concomitant treatment with the mNCE inhibitor CGP-37157 ameliorated these effects. CGP-37157 also attenuated ouabain-induced cellular Ca(2+) overload and prevented delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). In isolated perfused hearts, ouabain's positive effects on contractility and respiration were markedly potentiated by CGP-37157, as were those mediated by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, CGP-37157 inhibited the arrhythmogenic effects of ouabain in both isolated perfused hearts and in vivo. The findings reveal the mechanism behind cardiac glycoside toxicity and show that improving mitochondrial Ca(2+) retention by mNCE inhibition can mitigate these effects, particularly with respect to the suppression of Ca(2+)-triggered arrhythmias, while enhancing positive inotropic actions. These results suggest a novel strategy for the treatment of heart failure.",

We suggest that this syndrome may be more common than previously recognized, and that it may be related to the use of dopaminergic medications and environmental triggers on a background of a susceptible individual. This syndrome suggests interesting parallels with the pathophysiology of amphetamine-induced psychosis and schizophrenia.",

One thousand nine hundred and forty of 1945 patients completed the 24-hour observation period after initial IM treatment. Patients from 12 European countries were included (mean age 39 years; 58% male, 66% schizophrenia). IM treatment was at the physician's discretion. The primary objective was to describe the acute tolerability of IM psychotropic therapies in clinical practice, with particular emphasis on EPS. At baseline, 68% of the patients received IM monotherapy, with IM olanzapine most commonly prescribed (36%). During the first 24 hours, 190 (9.8%) patients experienced EPS. The occurrence of EPS was statistically significantly lower in patients treated with IM olanzapine compared to those treated with other IM psychotropic medications (mainly typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines): acute dystonia: 1.1%, 95% CI 0.5-2.3 and 2.9%, CI 2.0-4.0; akathisia: 2.3%, CI 1.3-3.7 and 5.5%, CI 4.3-6.9; Parkinsonism: 2.9%, CI 1.8-4.4 and 7.8%, CI 6.4-9.4, respectively. Anticholinergic treatment was given to 12% IM olanzapine versus 31% non-olanzapine treated patients.

Analysis revealed significant reductions in drug use at 1 year within all settings, but the pattern varied. Proportions using heroin reduced in all settings, unprescribed benzodiazepines reduced in community, and general practitioner settings and cocaine use reduced in community and Government health board settings. A logistic model controlling for intake methadone dose, setting, previous treatments, and intake heroin use revealed that setting was a significant factor in predicting heroin use at 1 year but was not significant in predicting changes in health. Findings illustrate that drug outcomes improved across all settings, and health did not improve in any setting. For optimum outcomes to be achieved, opiate users must be directed to settings that best match their needs and that the \"one-stop-shop for methadone\" is not the most effective solution.", 
    "111": "A planar differential mobility spectrometer (DMS) was coupled to a Mini 10 handheld rectilinear ion trap (RIT) mass spectrometer (MS) (total weight 10 kg), and the performance of the instrument was evaluated using illicit drug analysis. Coupling of DMS (which requires a continuous flow of drift gas) with a miniature MS (which operates best using sample introduction via a discontinuous atmospheric pressure interface, DAPI), was achieved with auxiliary pumping using a 5 L/min miniature diaphragm sample pump placed between the two devices. On-line ion mobility filtering showed to be advantageous in reducing the background chemical noise in the analysis of the psychotropic drug diazepam in urine using nanoelectrospray ionization. The combination of a miniature mass spectrometer with simple and rapid gas-phase ion separation by DMS allowed the characteristic fragmentation pattern of diazepam to be distinguished in a simple urine extract at lower limits of detection (50 ng/mL) than that achieved without DMS (200 ng/mL). The additional separation power of DMS facilitated the identification of two drugs of similar molecular weight, morphine (average MW = 285.34) and diazepam (average MW = 284.70), using a miniature mass spectrometer capable of unit resolution. The similarity in the proton affinities of these two compounds resulted in some cross-interference in the MS data due to facile ionization of the neutral form of the compound even when the ionic form had been separated by DMS.", 
    "112": "A key aim of supply-side drug law enforcement is to reduce drug use by increasing the retail price of drugs. Since most illicit drug users are polydrug users the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the extent to which drug users reduce their overall consumption of drugs. The literature shows that drug users do reduce their consumption of a drug when its price increases. However the extent of that decrease and the implications for the use of other drugs vary across studies.", 
    "113": "A sample of 101 Australian methamphetamine users was surveyed using a behavioural economics approach. Participants were given a hypothetical fixed drug budget, presented with a range of drug price lists and asked how many units of each drug they would purchase. Methamphetamine and heroin prices were varied independently across trials.", 
    "114": "While demand for both methamphetamine and heroin was found to be price elastic, elasticity estimates were influenced by the nature of participants' drug dependence. The group least responsive to changes in methamphetamine price were those dependent only on methamphetamine, while the group most responsive were dependent only on heroin. Similar findings emerged in relation to changes in heroin price. Cross-price elasticity analysis showed limited substitution into other drugs as the price of methamphetamine increased. In contrast, for heroin, there was significant substitution into pharmaceutical opioids and to a lesser extent, benzodiazepines and methamphetamine. However, for the most part, the decreases in methamphetamine or heroin consumption outweighed any substitution into other drugs.", 
    "115": "The reduction in overall drug consumption and expenditure in response to price increases in heroin and methamphetamine observed in this sample lend support to supply-side enforcement strategies that aim to increase retail drug price. Notably, this analysis highlights the importance of accounting for the nature of users' drug dependence in estimating price responsiveness.", 
    "116": "In vitro biotransformation of drug using commercial culture medium with serum may not be the ideal culture medium for clinical application in extracorporeal bioartificial liver support (BAL) systems. In these systems, patient's blood or plasma is plumbed to primary hepatocytes within a seeded bioreactor, creating interaction between plasma and seeded hepatocytes. To address this situation, we investigated the biotransformation potential of diazepam in primary porcine hepatocytes with a flat membrane bioreactor (FMB); we used human plasma exposure and serum-free media in organotypical double gel culture model for long-term culture. We investigated diazepam clearance and all major metabolites of diazepam, such as oxazepam, temazepam, and desmethyldiazepam, in conventional single gel and organotypical sandwich models and compared them to the FMB model. Diazepam elimination was higher in double gel cultures with exposure to both SF 3 medium conditions and plasma, when compared to the single gel model in a Petri dish. It was observed that in the FMB, diazepam elimination was stable at about 3 pg/h/cell in plasma and SF 3 exposure. Oxazepam synthesis in the bioreactor was approximately one quarter less than in the Petri dish, but there were no differences between N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam synthesis in double gel culture. In the flat membrane bioreactor, there was no decrease in the biotransformation of diazepam in plasma exposure compared with the control group. Our results suggest that this plasma exposure bioreactor may offer a useful approach in clinical use of extracorporeal BAL, as well as for drug metabolite investigation into toxicological research.",

No previous studies have characterized the effects of BDZ and NBDZ hypnotics on ACh release in the PRF. This study tested 2 hypotheses: (1) that microdialysis delivery of zolpidem, eszopiclone, and diazepam to rat PRF alters ACh release in PRF and electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power and (2) that intravenous (i.v.) administration of eszopiclone to non-anesthetized rat alters ACh release in the PRF, sleep, and EEG delta power.",

Thus, the effects of midazolam on extrasynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors in substantia gelatinosa neurons and interaction with noradrenaline, a transmitter of the descending inhibitory systems, were investigated.",

    "142": "Bath application of midazolam induced tonic outward currents in the presence of gabazine. Although the decay time of synaptic current was prolonged, neither frequency nor amplitude was affected by midazolam. In contrast, the application of noradrenaline markedly increased both frequency and amplitude of synaptic currents with a slight enhancement of tonic currents. Coapplication of noradrenaline and midazolam markedly increased tonic currents, and the increase was much greater than the sum of currents induced by noradrenaline and midazolam.", 
    "143": "Midazolam had much larger effects on extrasynaptic GABA type A receptors than the synaptic receptors, suggesting a role of the enhancement of GABAergic extrasynaptic currents in the midazolam-induced analgesia. Because noradrenaline is shown to increase extrasynaptic GABA concentration, simultaneous administration of noradrenaline and midazolam may enhance the increased GABA action by midazolam, thereby resulting in an increase in tonic extrasynaptic currents.",

The protective effects of diazepam against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions was significantly increased and the mortality rate was reduced by concurrent treatment with etoricoxib (10 mg/kg p.o.) when compared with diazepam groups. No neurotoxic effect was observed with etoricoxib (10 mg/kg p.o.) and it had no impact on motor coordination in the chimney test in mice.

We report a 41-year-old female patient with primary progressive MS receiving olanzapine and oxcarbazepine for psychotic disorder. Five years prior she began to develop severe spastic quadriparesis, rendering her a candidate for ITB treatment. After ITB test bolus application, however, she experienced a first epileptic seizure. Our observation indicates that ITB may trigger seizures in patients with MS. The observed seizure occurred during ITB bolus testing despite antiepileptic co-medication, which concurs with previous reports suggesting that rapid changes in the dose of ITB may carry a higher risk of seizure induction.",

The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of topiramate to assist dosage adjustments in individual patients. Steady-state topiramate plasma concentrations in patients with epilepsy were determined by HPLC using fluorescent labelling. Demographic, biochemical data and dosing history including concomitant drug therapy were collected from patients' charts. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was used to fit a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The influence of patient weight and gender, body surface area, age, creatinine clearance, serum transaminases, topiramate daily dose and co-treatment with carbamazepine, valproic acid, benzodiazepines, and risperidone on topiramate pharmacokinetics was evaluated. Additionally, the relationship between topiramate plasma concentration and clinical response was investigated. Volume of distribution of topiramate was 0.518 l/kg. For a typical patient oral clearance was estimated at 1.47 l/h, with interindividual variability of 39.2%. Clearance was 70% higher in patients co-treated with carbamazepine and was found to increase with patient age. Somnolence was the most frequently observed adverse event. Incidence of headache was associated with topiramate plasma concentration. Somnolence, ataxia, tremor, speech disorders and fatigue were associated with adjunctive therapy with carbamazepine, valproic acid, benzodiazepines, risperidone, and clozapine. No association of topiramate plasma concentration with frequency of seizures or patient quality of life was observed.

    "176": "Alcoholism and anxiety disorders have a huge impact on society and afflict 17.6 million and 40 million people in the United States, respectively. A strong comorbidity exists between alcoholism and anxiety disorders. Indeed, alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety is a primary contributing factor for relapse, and anxiolytics are a common adjuvant therapy prescribed for treatment-seeking alcoholics. It is thought that the use of alcohol to self-medicate and relieve anxiety contributes to the development of addiction. Treatment for anxiety disorders and alcoholism exist but are not universally effective. The delta opioid receptor (DOR) plays a role in both alcohol consumption and anxiety, making it a very interesting clinical target. Two pharmacologically distinct DORs have been described: DOR1 and DOR2. We find here that the relative specificity of DOR agonists for DOR1 or DOR2 can greatly affect the effects they exert on ethanol consumption and anxiety. The DOR1 agonist 2-methyl-4a\u03b1-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,3,4,4a,5,12,12a\u03b1-octahydro-quinolino[2,3,30g]isoquinoline (TAN-67), although not effective in decreasing anxiety-like behavior in naive mice, has anxiolytic-like properties in ethanol-withdrawn mice. In contrast, a less subtype-selective agonist, (+)-4-[(\u03b1R)-\u03b1-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC80), while also reducing anxiety-like behavior, increases ethanol consumption. In addition, we found that the conical anxiolytic diazepam [DZ; 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one] is a less effective anxiolytic in ethanol-withdrawn mice than in naive mice. Together, our findings suggest that selective DOR agonists can decrease anxiety-like behavior and are more effective than diazepam at reducing ethanol consumption. We believe the dual efficacy of DOR1 agonists makes these receptors an interesting therapeutic target for treatment-seeking alcoholics.",

It showed a significant inhibition of the seizures induced by electroshock and pentylenetetrazole in a dose dependent manner and the activity was comparable to phenytoin and diazepam. Significant decrease in locomotion revealing its CNS depressant activity was observed. The findings suggest that embelin possess anticonvulsant activity against both grand mal and petit mal epilepsy.",

Here employing flow cytometry to monitor mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca(2+), we assessed trans-mitochondrial Ca(2+)-transport and store-operated Ca(2+)-influx (store-operated channels (SOC)) in malignant vs. non-malignant B16BL6 melanoma clones. Remarkably, mitochondrial Ca(2+)-fluxes measured in whole cells or in isolated mitochondria were accelerated in the malignant clones compared to their non-malignant counterpart clones. This coincided with enhanced SOC-mediated Ca(2+)-influx and high levels of constitutively active protein kinase B/Akt (PKB). Interruption of trans-mitochondrial Ca(2+)-transport in the malignant cells with an antagonist of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, CGP-37157, abolsihed SOC-mediated Ca(2+)-influx, inactivated PKB, retarded cell growth and increased vulnerability to apoptosis. Similarly, direct SOC blockade by silencing Stim1 inhibited PKB, indicating that the crosstalk between SOC and mitochondria is essential to preserve PKB in constitutively active state. Finally, the retraction of mitochondria from sub-plasmalemmal micro-domains triggered by Fis1 over-expression inhibited SOC-coupled trans-mitochondrial Ca(2+)-flux, Ca(2+)-entry via SOC and PKB activity. Taken together, our data show that in the malignant melanoma cells, the functional and spatial relationship of up-regulated mitochondrial Ca(2+)-transport to the SOC sustains the robust Ca(2+)-responses and down-stream signaling critical for apoptosis-resistance and proliferation.",

However, also controversial results exist. The aim was to describe associations between the use of a psychotropic drug, or the concomitant use of two or more of these drugs and the risk of fractures in a population aged 65 years or over.",

The objective was to describe gender-specific associations between the use of one psychotropic drug [benzodiazepine (BZD), antipsychotic (AP) or antidepressant (AD)] or the concomitant use of two or more psychotropic drugs and the risk of fractures in a population 65 years or over. Subjects were participants in the first wave of the Lieto study in 1990-1991, and they were followed up until the end of 1996. Information about fractures confirmed with radiology reports in 1,177 subjects (482 men and 695 women) during the follow-up was collected from medical records. Two follow-up periods (three and six years) were used, and previously found risk factors of fractures were adjusted as confounding factors separately for men and women. The Poisson regression model was used in the analyses.",

Blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, locomotor activity and behaviour (by video) were monitored continuously for 24h post-dose. Animals underwent a standardised neurobehavioural test battery which allowed the direct examination of 31 signs, including behavioural responses and neurological examinations, conducted the day before dose, at maximal plasma concentration time (T(max)), and 24 h post-dose. The study was carried out in a first phase with telemetric cardiovascular recording only, and a second phase with telemetric cardiovascular recording and neurobehavioural observations. Results from the second phase of the study were used to evaluate the influence of the direct neurobehavioural examination on the telemetrically acquired cardiovascular parameters.",

    "187": "Aim of present research was to assess, by means of descriptive and multivariate approaches, in Wistar rats tested in hole-board apparatus, whether a microstructure of hole-exploratory behavior may be identified in the behavioral response to anxiety. Two groups of 15 subjects were tested: one received 1 ml of saline IP and one was IP injected with diazepam at 0.5 mg/kg dissolved in 1 ml of saline. Following saline, six not yet reported hole-exploratory components were identified: active-dip, static-dip, rapid-dip, circular-sniff, point-sniff and central-sniff. Diazepam provoked significant changes of their per cent distribution. Results of multivariate analyses revealed a complex microstructure of hole-exploratory elements characterized by behavioral flows between sniffing and dipping patterns. Diazepam significantly modified several patternings, mainly those involving point-sniff and static-dip. Hence, the hypothesis of an important role of such behavioral elements and of their patternings, in anxiety-related hole-exploratory behavior, can be proposed. It is suggested that modifications of point-sniff and static-dip patternings could evidence even subtle changes of animal anxiety condition.", 
    "188": "Systemic (IP) and/or intraseptal (IS) administration of scopolamine (SCP) and diazepam (DZP) induce amnesia, whereas IP injection of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and choline chloride (ChCl) produce memory facilitation. The septohippocampal cholinergic system has been pointed out as a possible site of SCP and DZP-induced amnesia as well as for the mnemonic effects induced by SP and ChCl. We performed a series of experiments in order to investigate the interactions between cholinergic and GABA/benzodiazepine (GABA/BZD) systems with the SPergic system on inhibitory avoidance retention. Male Wistar rats were trained and tested in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task (1.0 mA footshock). Animals received, pre-training, IP (1.0 mg/kg) or IS (1.0 nM/0.5 microl) injection of DZP, SCP (SCP; 1.0 mg/kg - IP or 0.5 microM/0.5 microl--IS) or vehicle (VEH). Immediately after training they received an IP or IS injections of SP 1-11 (50 microg/kg--IP or 1.0 nM/0.5 microl--IS), SP 1-7 (167 microg/kg--IP or 1.0 nM/0.5 microl--IS), ChCl (20 mg/kg--IP or 0.3 microM/0.5 microl--IS) or VEH. Rats pretreated with SCP and DZP showed amnesia. Post-trial treatments with SP 1-11, SP 1-7 or ChCl blocked the amnesic effects of SCP and DZP. These findings suggest an interaction between SPergic and cholinergic mechanisms with GABAergic systems in the modulation of inhibitory avoidance retention and that the effects of these treatments are mediated, at least in part, by interactions in the septohippocampal pathway.", 
    "189": "Nerve agent-induced seizures cause neuronal damage in brain limbic and cortical circuits leading to persistent behavioral and cognitive deficits. Without aggressive anticholinergic and benzodiazepine therapy, seizures can be prolonged and neuronal damage progresses for extended periods of time. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the nerve agent soman on expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the initial enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the proinflammatory prostaglandins and a factor that has been implicated in seizure initiation and propagation. Rats were exposed to a toxic dose of soman and scored behaviorally for seizure intensity. Expression of COX-2 was determined throughout brain from 4h to 7 days after exposure by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Microglial activation and astrogliosis were assessed microscopically over the same time-course. Soman increased COX-2 expression in brain regions known to be damaged by nerve agents (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala, piriform cortex and thalamus). COX-2 expression was induced in neurons, and not in microglia or astrocytes, and remained elevated through 7 days. The magnitude of COX-2 induction was correlated with seizure intensity. COX-1 expression was not changed by soman. Increased expression of neuronal COX-2 by soman is a late-developing response relative to other signs of acute physiological distress caused by nerve agents. COX-2-mediated production of prostaglandins is a consequence of the seizure-induced neuronal damage, even after survival of the initial cholinergic crisis is assured. COX-2 inhibitors should be considered as adjunct therapy in nerve agent poisoning to minimize nerve agent-induced seizure activity.", 
    "190": "Innate and learned flavor preferences influence food and fluid choices in animals. Two primary forms of learned preferences involve flavor-flavor and flavor-nutrient associations in which a particular flavor element (e.g., odor) is paired with an innately preferred flavor element (e.g., sweet taste) or with a positive post-oral nutrient consequence. This review summarizes recent findings related to the neurochemical basis of learned flavor preferences. Systemic and central injections of dopamine receptor antagonists implicate brain dopamine signaling in both flavor-flavor and flavor-nutrient conditioning by the taste and post-oral effects of sugars. Dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala and lateral hypothalamus is involved in one or both forms of conditioning and selective effects are produced by D1-like and D2-like receptor antagonism. Opioid receptor antagonism, despite its suppressive action on sugar intake and reward, has little effect on the acquisition or expression of flavor preferences conditioned by the sweet taste or post-oral actions of sugars. Other studies indicate that flavor preference conditioning by sugars is differentially influenced by glutamate receptor antagonism, cannabinoid receptor antagonism and benzodiazepine receptor activation.", 
    "191": "The nerve agent VX is most likely to enter the body via liquid contamination of the skin. After percutaneous exposure, the slow uptake into the blood, and its slow elimination result in toxic levels in plasma for a period of several hours. Consequently, this has implications for the development of toxic signs and for treatment onset. In the present study, clinical signs, toxicokinetics and effects on respiration, electroencephalogram and heart rate were investigated in hairless guinea pigs after percutaneous exposure to 500 microg/kg VX. We found that full inhibition of AChE and partial inhibition of BuChE in blood were accompanied by the onset of clinical signs, reflected by a decline in respiratory minute volume, bronchoconstriction and a decrease in heart rate. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a single dose of atropine, obidoxime and diazepam, administered at appearance of first clinical signs, versus that of repetitive dosing of these drugs on the reappearance of signs. A single shot treatment extended the period to detrimental physiological decline and death for several hours, whereas repetitive administration remained effective as long as treatment was continued. In conclusion, percutaneous VX poisoning showed to be effectively treatable when diagnosed on time and when continued over the entire period of time during which VX, in case of ineffective decontamination, penetrates the skin.", 
    "192": "The antinociceptive actions of diazepam and other benzodiazepines are partly due to their anxiolytic-like properties.", 
    "193": "This study was conducted to analyze the relationship between the anxiolytic-like and antinociceptive effects of diazepam when injected into the anterior basolateral amygdala (ABLA) and the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG). These areas were selected because of their important participation in the regulation of anxiety and defensive responses.", 
    "194": "The anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam was evaluated with the rat burying behaviour test. The pain-induced functional impairment in the rat (PIFIR) model was used to study the effects of diazepam on nociception. Nociception was induced by intra-articular injection of 15% uric acid into the knee joint of the right hind limb.", 
    "195": "Sole exposure to the burying behaviour test produced a slight non-significant hyperalgesic effect. Diazepam injection (2.0 microg/0.4 microl) into the ABLA or dPAG produced a reduction in cumulative burying behaviour--an anxiolytic-like effect--together with an increase in burying behaviour latency. Such reduced experimental anxiety was paralleled by an antinociceptive response (i.e., increased use of the uric-acid-injected limb). Reduced experimental anxiety was correlated with antinociception after diazepam infusion into both brain structures.", 
    "196": "Diazepam-reduced experimental anxiety was paralleled by antinociceptive effects.", 
    "197": "Organophosphorus (OP) pesticides are a broad class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are responsible for tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide, contributing to an estimated 300,000 deaths annually. Current pharmacotherapy for acute OP poisoning includes the use of atropine, an oxime, and benzodiazepines. However, even with such therapy, the mortality from these agents are as high as 40%. Enzymatic hydrolysis of OPs is an attractive new potential therapy for acute OP poisoning. A number of bacterial OP hydrolases have been isolated. A promising OP hydrolase is an enzyme isolated from Agrobacterium radiobacter, named OpdA. OpdA has been shown to decrease lethality in rodent models of parathion and dichlorvos poisoning. However, pharmacokinetic data have not been obtained. In this study, we examined the pharmacokinetics of OpdA in an African Green Monkey model. At a dose of 1.2mg/kg the half-life of OpdA was approximately 40 min, with a mean residence time of 57 min. As expected, the half-life did not change with the dose of OpdA given: at doses of 0.15 and 0.45 mg/kg, the half-life of OpdA was 43.1 and 38.9 min, respectively. In animals subjected to 5 daily doses of OpdA, the residual activity that was measured 24h after each OpdA dose increased 5-fold for the 0.45 mg/kg dose and 11-fold for the 1.2mg/kg dose. OpdA exhibits pharmacokinetics favorable for the further development as a therapy for acute OP poisoning, particularly for hydrophilic OP pesticides. Future work to increase the half-life of OpdA may be beneficial.",

    "205": "Developmental pharmacodynamics is the study of age-related maturation of the structure and function of biologic systems and how this affects response to pharmacotherapy. This may manifest as a change in the potency, efficacy, or therapeutic range of a drug. The paucity of studies exploring developmental pharmacodynamics reflects the lack of suitable juvenile animal models and the ethical and practical constraints of conducting studies in children. However, where data from animal models are available, valuable insight has been gained into how response to therapy can change through the course of development. For example, animal neurodevelopmental models have revealed that temporal differences in the maturation of norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems may explain the lack of efficacy of some antidepressants in children. GABA(A) receptors that switch from an excitatory to inhibitory mode during early development help to explain paradoxical seizures experienced by infants after exposure to benzodiazepines. The increased sensitivity of neonates to morphine may be due to increased postnatal expression of the mu opioid receptor. An age dependency to the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship has also been found in some clinical studies. For example, immunosuppressive effects of ciclosporin (cyclosporine) revealed markedly enhanced sensitivity in infants compared with older children and adults. A study of sotalol in the treatment of children with supraventricular tachycardia showed that neonates exhibited a higher sensitivity towards QTc interval prolongation compared with older children. However, the data are limited and efforts to increase and establish data on developmental pharmacodynamics are necessary to achieve optimal drug therapy in children and to ensure long-term success of pediatric drug development. This requires a dual 'bottom up' (ontogeny knowledge driven) and 'top down' (pediatric pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies) approach.",
