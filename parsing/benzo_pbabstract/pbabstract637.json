    "0": "The efficacy of ketazolam (Solatran) in alleviating the symptoms of short-term reactive or neurotic anxiety in thirty-three patients was examined using a single 30 mg night-time dose in an open study. Patients were to receive treatment for up to 1 month and thereafter as necessary for several months. At the follow-up visits, at the end of the first, second and fourth weeks and then at the end of therapy if continued, the clinical condition was assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and physician's and patients' subjective global assessments. A highly significant improvement was observed after a week's treatment in both somatic and psychic aspects of anxiety. A favourable response as measured by the two subjective assessments was observed in more than 80% of the patients by the third visit. There were two reports of morning tiredness, both dose-related, but no other adverse effects. Only four patients derived no benefit from the treatment.", 
    "1": "Sixty patients scheduled for day case surgery were allocated into two groups in a double-blind study. One group received temazepam 20 mg or 30 mg orally 1 hour before surgery whilst the second group received a placebo of identical appearance. The use of temazepam was followed by a greater frequency of sedation and anxiolysis and with fewer problems at induction. The time to awaken, the level of postoperative sedation and the ability to walk unaided were similar in both groups. Postoperative sequelae were less frequent in the temazepam group. Temazepam is advocated as a suitable drug for premedication in day case surgery.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepine binding sites, solubilized with 1% digitonin, were used to study specific [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNP) binding. Specific binding increased nonlinearly with increasing amounts of digitonin extract in the assay. Specific binding was increased, and the relationship to amount of extract became linear, in the presence of 2% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG). Heat treatment destroyed binding activity of the extract, but not ability to inhibit [3H]FNP binding. Kinetic analysis showed inhibition to be noncompetitive. The inhibitory activity was sensitive to trypsin. Extracts of repeatedly frozen, thawed, and washed membrane preparations still possessed inhibitory activity. It is suggested that digitonin solubilizes a membrane protein that inhibits benzodiazepine binding. PEG apparently removes this substance from the binding sites.", 
    "3": "At least 10% of the American population medically use prescribed psychopharmacological medications; and such psychotropic medications account for approximately 20% of all prescriptions in this country. Furthermore, there is widespread illicit use of psychoactive drugs, including narcotics, psychostimulants, and central nervous system depressants. All of these agents have potent effects on the cardiovascular system and, in addition, may undergo numerous drug-drug interactions with cardiovascular medications. Given the high incidence of both cardiovascular disease and psychoactive drug use in the United States, it is likely that clinicians manage many patients with cardiovascular disease, possible receiving cardiovascular medications, and also needing psychopharmacological interventions. Consequently, the authors have reviewed the pharmacology of the major classes of psychoactive agents: (I & II) Antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors); (III) Lithium Carbonate; (IV) Major Tranquilizers (phenothiazines, thioxanthines, butyrophenones, reserpine); and (V) Minor tranquilizers, Sedatives, and Hypnotics (benzodiazepines and barbiturates) with respect to their cardiotoxicity, cardiovascular side effects, and drug-drug interactions. Management of the cardiovascular complications of psychotropic overdose is discussed, as well as potential therapeutic uses of psychopharmacological medications in patients with cardiovascular pathology.", 
    "4": "Triazolam (T) is a new, potent hypnotic with a short duration of action in man. After an 0.88-mg oral dose of T-14C in six male subjects, mean recovery of 14C radioactivity was 85% in urine and 8% in feces. The major urinary metabolites were alpha-hydroxytriazolam (alpha-HT) and 4-hydroxytriazolam (4-HT), accounting for 69% and 11% of the urinary 14C, and these were mostly in conjugated form. alpha, 4-Dihydroxytriazolam and three dichlorotriazolylbenzophenone analogs were minor metabolites. At least 85% of the dose was rapidly absorbed; mean absorption half-life (t1/2A) was 2.8 min. After reaching a mean peak plasma level (Cmax) of 8.8 ng/ml at mean time (tmax) of 1.3 hr, plasma T decreased rapidly with a mean elimination half-life (t1/2E) of 2.3 hr. The remainder of the plasma 14C consisted predominantly of glucuronides of alpha-HT and 4-HT. Mean plasma parameters for these metabolites were as follows: alpha-HT-glucuronide, t1/2E = 3.9 hr, tmax = 1.3 hr, Cmax = 6.1 ng/ml; 4-HT-glucuronide, t1/2E = 3.8 hr, tmax = 2.5 hr, Cmax = 6.1 ng/ml. Nonconjugated alpha-HT and 4-HT were present in plasma but in insufficient amounts for kinetic analysis. The results are consistent with the short duration of action.", 
    "5": "The data reviewed above are the basis for the models of drug action proposed by neuropharmacologists. Mechanisms of benzodiazepine action are currently attributed to increased inhibitory neurotransmission. Costa and Guidotti26 proposed that anticonvulsant and sedative properties are a consequence of enhanced inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by GABA. Muscle relaxation may result from glycinemimetic actions of benzodiazepines in the spinal cord. Antianxiety mechanisms may be effects of both glycine- and GABA-mediated inhibition of specific neuronal pathways in the brainstem and brain (see fig. 2). Antipsychotic and extrapyramidal effects of neuroleptic drugs may be a consequence of their action at dopaminergic receptors.", 
    "6": "Selective genetic and chemical lesions which affect specific neuronal populations in the cerebellum were studied for changes in benzodiazepine receptors. Destruction of cerebellar climbing fibers with 3-acetylpyridine, did not affect cerebellar benzodiazepine receptors. Destruction of Purkinje, basket and stellate cells with intracerebellar kainic acid, caused moderate decreases in benzodiazepine receptor density. Destruction of Purkinje cells with chronic high doses of phenytoin also caused a significant decrease in benzodiazepine receptor density. In \"weaver\" mice, which have a severe loss of granule cells, benzodiazepine receptor density was unchanged, while the absolute number of benzodiazepine receptors decreased by 57%. In \"staggerer\" mice which have diminished Purkinje cells dendritic thickenings at their synapses with parallel fibers and subsequent granule cell loss, there was a 45% decrease in benzodiazepine receptor density and a 90% decrease in the absolute number of benzodiazepine receptors. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors exist on cerebellar Purkinje cells, that they probably also occur on cerebellar granule cells, and that they do not appear to be present on cerebellar glial cells or on climbing fibers.", 
    "7": "Antihistamines directed at either the H1 or H2 histamine receptor have the well-known side effect of sedation. The mechanism for the CNS depressant action of antihistamines is unknown. We examine here the possibility that the mechanism may involve modulation of the cerebral benzodiazepine receptor. We demonstrate that cimetidine and pyrilamine are competitive antagonists of 3H-benzodiazepine binding to human cerebral receptor in vitro. The inhibition of radioligand binding was not specific for benzodiazepine receptor, however, since antihistamines also antagonized binding to GABA, opiate, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The interaction of antihistamine with CNS receptors other than histamine receptor may explain, at least in part, the side effect of sedation.", 
    "8": "The efficiency of flunitrazepam was evaluated on the three phases of sleep in 20 patients 65 years old and more hospitalized suffering from severe insomnia. The experiment lasted 6 days. The initial dosage of half a tablet was sufficient and was maintained in 13 patients. In 5 subjects, dosage had to be increased to one tablet. In one subject, it was reduced to a quarter of a tablet. In the three quarters of the patients, the onset of sleep was of better quality; their actual sleep was longer and also of higher quality. The waking up was much easier in 18 patients who felt relaxed and alert during the morning. The alertness tests confirmed the patients state. The efficiency was satisfactory and the tolerance was very good. Taking into account the individual sensitivity of the aged, initial dosages must be small and adjusted according to the therapeutic responses.", 
    "9": "The effect of hydrogen, chloride and calcium ions on the binding of diazepam to human serum albumin has been studied by circular dichroism and equilibrium dialysis. In all cases the molar ellipticity of the diazepam-albumin complex increases with pH over the pH range 5 to 9. Under these conditions the free concentration of diazepam at a constant low drug to protein ratio decreases with pH. This free concentration is higher in the presence of chloride and calcium ions. With a two state conformational model for albumin it was shown, that the pH dependences of molar ellipticity of the diazepam-albumin complex and of the free concentration of diazepam are linked. It was demonstrated that the N-B transition of albumin is involved in the pH dependent binding of diazepam. The consequences of these findings for equilibrium dialysis procedures in determining free plasma levels of diazepam are discussed.", 
    "10": "Analogous to the progression of events in the opiate receptor-enkaphalin area, the first reports that benzodiazepines have selective and specific high-affinity binding sites in brain have stimulated a search for the endogenous 'ligand' or substance that might normally act at these sites. Braestrup and co-workers have extracted from human urine a gamma-fraction (ref. 10) which they have recently identified as beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta CEE). They reported that this substance is extremely potent in displacing 3H-diazepam from brain binding sites and proposed that a beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid derivative might, in part, be the endogenous ligand for the brain benzodiazepine receptor. We have examined several synthetically derived beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid analogues and now present data obtained from testing only the beta CEE described by Braestrup et al. In addition to confirming these workers' observation that this compound is a potent displacer of 3H-diazepam from brain tissue, our pharmacological data indicate that beta CEE has activity that is opposite to, rather than similar to, that of diazepam.", 
    "11": "The position of benzodiazepine dependence among addiction diseases was studied retrospectively by analysing the case reports of in-patients at the Psychiatric Clinic, G\u00f6ttingen. Addicts constitute the largest group of patients in this clinic, a situation probably true in general of psychiatric hospitals in the Federal Republic of Germany. Isolated alcoholism is the most frequent addiction, followed by combined alcohol-drug dependence and pure drug dependence. At present, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used addictive drugs. Although most of benzodiazepine dependents have changed to it from another drug, primary benzodiazepine dependence is increasing. Among the benzodiazepines, lorazepam seems to have a particularly high addiction potential. On withdrawal of benzodiazepines, symptoms were less marked than after stopping a combination of benzodiazepines and alcohol, and (or) barbiturates; they generally developed with some time delay.", 
    "12": "The stimulus-induced release of [3H]glutamic acid from striatal tissue was actively modulated by a presynaptic GABA receptor. The agonist responses of this GABA receptor were modified stereoselectively by benzodiazepines at low concentrations. The results correlate well with effects seen in [3H]GABA binding experiments and as they demonstrate benzodiazepine-induced changes in GABA receptor properties in a tissue prism preparation, these results suggest that the mechanisms described for extensively disrupted preparations may also apply to whole tissue.", 
    "13": "An approach to outpatient anesthesia using drugs that have reversible or very short-acting effects is described, along with a method of monitoring patients using pulse rate to assess tranquility. Preoperatively, the patient is given 1 mg of lorazepam the evening before surgery and sublingual lorazepam 1 mg combined with hydroxyzine 50 mg intramuscularly one hour before surgery. Before infiltration of local anesthesia, intravenous diazepam in 2.5 mg increments is given if needed, followed by a mixture of meperidine and pentazocine intravenously in exactly a 10:1 ratio. If hypnosis is needed, methohexital can be administered using a 0.2% drip by infusion pump. If respiratory depression is seen, intravenous naloxone, 0.2 to 0.4 mg, can be given to reverse any residual effects of meperidine and pentazocine, or, if large doses of intravenous diazepam have been used in a very agitated patient, one can administer physostigmine 1 to 2 mg.", 
    "14": "The purpose of this study was to examine the respiratory depression produced by diazepam and by midazolam. Ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure responses to CO2 were measured in eight healthy volunteers before and after the intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg of diazepam and 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam. The mean ventilatory response to CO2 (mean +/- SEM) decreased after administration of diazepam or midazolam from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 1.min-1/torr or from 2.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.1 1.min-1/torr, respectively. In the same volunteers, the mouth occlusion pressure responses decreased from 0.54 +/- 0.05 to 0.30 +/- 0.04 cm H2O/torr after midazolam and from 0.67 +/- 0.12 to 0.28 +/- 0.07 cm H2O/torr after diazepam. When compared with the control slopes of the ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure responses, the drug slopes were significantly different. Respiration was similarly depressed after diazepam and after midazolam. That both the ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure responses to CO2 are equally depressed by intravenous injections of midazolam and of diazepam at equipotent doses suggests a direct depression of the central respiratory drive by these drugs.", 
    "15": "The implications for institutional pharmacists of the recent Food and Drug Administration omnibus regulation that mandates patient package inserts (PPIs) are discussed. FDA issued a final rule on September 12, 1980, establishing a three-year trial period during which PPIs must be dispensed with each new prescription for 10 specific drugs or drug classes. Involved are the drugs cimetidine, clofibrate, propoxyphene, phenytoin, warfarin, digoxin, and methoxsalen, and the drug classes ampicillins, benzodiazepines, and thiazides. FDA will evaluate costs and benefits of this program during the three-year period and will issue a regulatory analysis before additional drugs are added to the rule. Institutions may adopt an alternate system to make PPIs available to inpatients. Specific recommendations for implementation of the PPI program in institutions are made.", 
    "16": "Clinical evidence of withdrawal phenomena and efficacy was studied in 23 long-term users of diazepam (15 to 50 mg daily). No withdrawal reactions were observed in the ten patients who received placebo in a double-blind fashion for a two-week period. Changes in anxiety scores of both patients who received placebo and those who received diazepam suggest that the diazepam continued to be effective when used for one year or longer.", 
    "17": "In a residential hospital research ward setting the effects of and preference for placebo and various oral doses of pentobarbital and diazepam were studied in volunteer human subjects with documented histories of sedative abuse. Drug-free days alternated with drug administration days throughout the study. After experimenter-scheduled exposures to the test drugs, subjects were given repeated opportunities to choose between two available drug alternatives. In experiment 1, pentobarbital (200-900 mg) produced dose-related increases in subject- and observer-rated drug effects, and subjects generally chose higher pentobarbital doses over lower doses. In experiment 2, diazepam (50-400 mg) produced only modest elevations in drug effect ratings and subjects did not consistently choose higher doses over lower doses. In experiment 3, 400 mg of pentobarbital and 200 mg of diazepam produced subject and observer drug effect ratings of similar magnitude while placebo produced negligible effects. All subjects chose pentobarbital over placebo and diazepam over placebo on all occasions; all subjects chose pentobarbital over diazepam on the majority of choice trials. Clinical impression confirmed by a post hoc analysis of nursing notes indicated that diazepam produced relatively subtle yet reliable changes in the global mood and behavior of the subjects in the direction of increased complaining, dysphoria and disruptivenes. The finding that pentobarbital is preferred to diazepam is compatible with previous human and animal drug self-administration studies as well as clinical information about the abuse of these drugs.", 
    "18": "1. After intravenous administration to 19 subjects, aged 18-95 years, plasma diazepam concentrations were measured over 160 h. Plasma protein binding of diazepam was also measured in each subject. 2. The terminal plasma half-life of diazepam ranged from 15.0 to 125 h and was positively correlated with age (r = 0.797). Total plasma diazepam clearance was not correlated with age (r = -0.017). 3. The free fraction of diazepam ranged from 0.0137 to 0.0386 and was significantly correlated with age (r = +0.863). Free diazepam clearance, which ranged from 432 to 1870 ml/min, was also correlated with age (r = -0.717). 4. It is concluded that the increased sensitivity of the elderly to diazepam is, at least in part, due to pharmacokinetic factors.", 
    "19": "A method is described for determination of 8-methoxypsoralen to 0.2 mL of suction-blister fluid or 1 mL of serum from psoriatic patients being treated with this drug. The drug is extracted from the biological matrix at pH 9.0 with a mixture of dichloromethane and light petroleum ether. 5-Methoxypsoralen is used as internal standard. Separation and quantitation are performed on a \"high-performance\" liquid chromatograph with use of an RP 18 reversed-phase column and detection at 245 nm. Accuracy and precision are good. Some benzodiazepines and their metabolites interfere. The lowest detectable concentration is 10 microgram/L, which means that the method is sufficiently sensitive to measure the drug concentrations in serum and suction-blister fluid for pharmacokinetic studies in patients being treated with a therapeutic dosage.", 
    "20": "Diazepam (Valium, Roche; 0.37 mg/kg was given by slow injection into the left femoral vein and flushed in with 0.9 % saline. Within 3 min following the i.v. injection of diazepam spontaneous respiration ceased in rats anaesthetized with chloralose; mean arterial pressure fell from a control level of 99.4 (+/- 28.3) mmHg to 32.5 (+/- 13.44) mmHg. If artificial ventilation was initiated immediately upon cessation of respiration, the animal recovered. Cats anesthetized with ketamine (Ketaset, Roger; 44 mg/kg i.m.) showed no respiratory depression following i.v. diazepam injection.", 
    "21": "Interference on the part of premedication with diazepam and trazodone with althesin anaesthesia was investigated and compared by means of variance analysis according to Fisher, and the X2c test according to Yates, in 150 patients aged 35-45 yr in three groups of 50 during examination of the uterine cavity. No marked difference between the effects of the two drugs were noted, with two exceptions: 1) trazodone was better able to potentiate the hypnotic action of althesin, so that less was needed for the induction of anaesthesia; 2) patients pretreated wih diazepam displayed a marked increase in postoperative somnolence, this being an expression of the drug's hypnotic effect.", 
    "22": "To determine the effectiveness of diazepam pretreatment in preventing succinylcholine-induced fasciculations, 61 surgical patients were randomly allocated into three groups receiving either diazepam (0.05 mg/kg), d-tubocurarine (0.05 mg/kg) or saline in a double-blind fashion. Following the induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and thiopental, a bolus dose of succinylcholine (1 mg/kg was injected 5 minutes after the pretreatment drugs. Resulting fasciculations were then graded visually. Responses to electrical simulation of the ulnar nerve, somatic motor responses to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, and changes in serum levels of potassium were also evaluated. Diazepam had no effect on frequency or intensity of succinylcholine fasciculations. Fasciculations were observed in 90% of the patients given placebo injections and in 95% of those given diazepam, but in only 16% of those given tubocurarine. Tubocurarine prolonged the onset and shortened the duration of the succinylcholine block and thus made intubation more difficult. Diazepam accelerated onset, but had no effect on duration of succinylcholine block. The twitch response following ulnar nerve stimulation disappeared after 84 seconds (p < 0.01 vs placebo) in patients given diazepam after 115 seconds in patients given tubocurarine, and after 106 seconds in those given placebo injections. The increase in serum potassium after succinylcholine was prevented by pretreatment with d-tubocurarine but not by diazepam.", 
    "23": "The use of electrical energy for the immediate treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is practical and easily applied. The method, though simple, is the most effective method for terminating cardiac arrhythmias and is associated with only a low risk if properly employed. In symptomatic patients, the utilization of cardioversion reduces patient discomfort and complications which may occur while awaiting pharmacologic reversion of arrhythmia. At present, transthoracic defibrillation is the only practical method for terminating VF. Despite the safety of electrical reversion, proper precautions are necessary to prevent complications. In particular, the discharge of excessive energies, especially in the presence of digitalis toxicity, promises grave and life-threatening consequences. The use of antiarrhythmic medications is not supplanted by cardioversion and defibrillation. Rather, ongoing drug therapy is frequently necessary to prevent recurrence of arrhythmia.", 
    "24": "The use of human tetanus antitoxin by lumbar intrathecal injection for the treatment of tetanus in five consecutive cases is reported. The intrathecal administration of human tetanus antitoxin as part of treatment appears to be the most effective treatment of tetanus and should be given as soon as the diagnosis of tetanus is established. The dose of antitoxin does not relate with the rapid improvement of muscle spasm.", 
    "25": "Valproic acid has recently been shown to be associated with liver disease in man. Rat hepatocyte cultures were used to test the hepatotoxicity of valproic acid and several other anticonvulsants. Dose-related hepatotoxicity was demonstrated for valproic acid at concentrations ranging from 10 to 320 micrograms/ml, therapeutic concentrations being 50-100 micrograms/ml. Hepatotoxicity could not be demonstrated for phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and clonazepam. It is concluded that valproic acid is a dose-related hepatotoxin.", 
    "26": "We evaluated a commercially available enzyme immunoassay method for determining the concentration of total diazepam plus its active metabolite, nordiazepam, in small amounts of serum and urine. The coefficients of variation were 5% within assay and 8% between assay. Concentrations so measured for patients' sera correlated well with those obtained both by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection and by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. For urine samples, the correlation between values obtained by the enzyme immunoassay method and those for total diazepam/nordiazepam/oxazepam obtained by liquid chromatography was adequate for routine clinical toxicological use. The ability of the immunoassay to determine other benzodiazepines was also evaluated.", 
    "27": "A trial was undertaken to assess the suitability of oxygen/nitrous oxide sedation (relative analgesia) for dental treatment in unmanageable handicapped young patients. Fifty patients with chronological ages 5-22 years and mental ages 1 1/2-14 years participated in the double blind trial to see if premedication with diazepam 0.2 mg/kg would be a useful adjunct. After the trial, previous dental histories and behaviour at regular recall visits over the next 12-18 months were studied. Seventeen of 19 patients previously treated with general anaesthesia and 27 of 31 formerly untreated patients accepted treatment in the trial; of the 50 patients, 33 are continuing treatment with oxygen/nitrous oxide sedation, seven need general anaesthesia and 10 have moved from the district. It appears that the use of diazepam premedication improves patient demeanour and operating conditions although this improved effect is not carried over to recall visits. The results obtained indicate that routine dental procedures can be safely carried out by an experienced operator-sedationist in young handicapped patients using oxygen/nitrous oxide sedation. The frequency with which potentially hazardous techniques need to be used can be reduced, as can hospital admissions.", 
    "28": "To elucidate the physiological role of benzodiazepine receptors in convulsion, these receptors were studied in the brain of the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), an animal model used for the study of epilepsy. Benzodiazepine binding sites in the gerbil brain were demonstrated using [3H]diazepam. The binding was saturable and stereospecific. Benzodiazepines inhibited [3H]diazepam binding to the membranes and their ability to inhibit the binding closely correlated with their potency as anticonvulsants. These results showed that the characteristics of the benzodiazepine receptors in the Mongolian gerbil were similar to those obtained from rat and human brain. Seizures increase the specific binding of [3H]diazepam to the membranes of all regions of the gerbil brain, the most remarkable increase seen in the striatum. Time course studies showed that the increase reached a maximum 10 min after the seizure and the binding returned to the control level within 20 min. The increase in specific [3H]diazepam binding was due almost entirely to shifts in the affinity of [3H]diazepam for its receptors. Thus, the seizures may not be due to changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, and seizures produce an increase in receptor binding, which may be related to a physiological modification of excessive excitation.", 
    "29": "Barbiturates enhance the binding of [3H]diazepam to benzodiazepine receptor sites in rat brain. This effect occurs at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of barbiturates, and the relative activity of a series of compounds correlates highly with anesthetic activity of the barbiturates and with their ability to enhance postsynaptic inhibitory responses to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Barbiturate enhancement of benzodiazepine binding is stereospecific, with the more active anesthetic isomers of N1-methylbarbiturates being also more active than their stereoisomers in enhancing benzodiazepine binding. The active barbiturates produce a reversible enhancement in the affinity of specific benzodiazepine binding with no effect on the number of binding sites. The barbiturate enhancement, but not the baseline benzodiazepine binding, is competitively inhibited by the convulsant picrotoxinin (at 1-10 microM), a drug that has been shown to label barbiturate-sensitive brain membrane sites related to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-ionophore complex. The barbiturate effect is also dependent upon the presence of certain anions, and only those anions, that penetrate the chloride channels regulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. These results suggest that picrotoxin-sensitive barbiturate binding sites are coupled to benzodiazepine receptors in the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-ionophore complex, and that these binding sites have the properties of pharmacologically relevant receptors that mediate at least part of the action of various nervous system depressant and excitatory drugs.", 
    "30": "The effect of acute and chronic administration of phenytoin on [3H]flunitrazepam binding was examined in the rat cerebellum. There was no significant effect of phenytoin on [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the rat cerebellum 1 and 6 h after a single i.p. injection of 200 mg/kg of phenytoin. However, after 14 days and 28 days of chronic phenytoin administration, significant decreases in [3H]flunitrazepam receptor density were observed, with no changes in apparent affinity constants in the rat cerebellum. This effect of phenytoin was dose-dependent, as lower doses of phenytoin (100 mg/kg/day) for 14 or 28 days produced no alterations in [3H]flunitrazepam binding the the rat cerebellum. Light-microscopic examination of the rat cerebellum treated with 200 mg/kg/day of phenytoin for 14 days showed degeneration of the Purkinje cells, with edematous Bergmann astrocytes. These data provide evidence for the neuronal localization of benzodiazepine receptors on cerebellar Purkinje cells.", 
    "31": "The electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) continues to be of use in the management of patients suffering from affective psychosis and some clinical forms of schizophrenia. The use of premedicated anaesthetic and miorelaxant drugs lessens the possibility of complications, but risks the induction of serious cardiorespiratory accidents. The flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with hypnotic, ansiolytic and miorelaxant properties, which has been used as an anaesthetic in major and minor surgery. 241 ECT were essayed on 28 psychotic patients and flunitrazepam induced deep sleep in 94.6% of the applications within 0.5 and 15 minutes after the intravenous injection, the required dose oscillating between 2 and 4 mg. In all the applications a generalized convulsive crisis was induced. No significant pulse variations, arterial pressure, nor respiratory frequency took place. Post ECT agitation appeared in 0.82%. The associated pharmacological therapy (neuroleptics, lithium salts) did not modify the effect of flunitrazepam. Nor did tolerancy to the drug appear.", 
    "32": "During the years 1972--76 drug prescriptions and sales of drugs were surveyed in Iceland. Compared with the other Nordic countries, except Denmark, sales of the psychotropic drugs which may lead to addiction were highest in Iceland, as previously reported. Here we explain the efforts of the Icelandic health authorities to reduce the legitimate consumption of psychotropic drugs. These efforts are mainly directed towards doctors' prescriptions to outpatients. A survey of prescriptions and sales of drugs in Iceland in 1976--78 revealed that (1) the number of individuals receiving drugs subject to reporting in Iceland decreased by 40% between 1976 and 1978; (2) the prescribed amount of hypnotics and sedatives subject to reporting decreased by 45% in the same period; (3) the prescribed amount of narcotic analgesics decreased by 20%; (4) the prescribed amount of amphetamines and related drugs decreased by 40%; and (5) the amount sold of diazepam and related drugs decreased by 20%. The available data suggest that EDB-registration of prescriptions subject to recording and feedback to doctors about their prescribing habits contributes to a reduction in the use of the drugs recorded.", 
    "33": "The affinity of beta-carbolines, which may be formed in the body, to benzodiazepine and opiate receptors was studied by measuring their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam and [3H]-dihydromorphine on rat brain synaptosomal membranes. All \"aromatized\" beta-carbolines studied (norharmane, harmane and 6-methoxyharmane) inhibited the specific binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam in micromolar concentrations, dihydro-beta-carbolines (6-methoxyharmalan, harmalol) were less potent, while all tetrahydro-beta-carbolines showed very low affinity. 6-Hydroxytetrahydroharmane, which is formed by condensation 5HT with acetaldehyde, inhibited [3H]-dihydromorphine binding in micromolar concentration, while norharmane and tetrahydro-beta-carbolines without OH-group showed little affinity. beta-Carbolines are the most potent known natural benzodiazepine receptor ligands. Because they are formed after alcohol drinking, their effects on benzodiazepine and opiate receptors may be connected with alcohol dependence although some beta-carbolines may inhibit 5HT uptake in still lower concentrations.", 
    "34": "In a double blind study, the influence of the tranquilizer Camazepam on different ophthalmological parameters was examined. The 12 test persons were between 20 and 30 years of age and had entirely normal ocular findings. Visual acuity was uninfluenced by a single dose of 40 mg of Camazepam, reflecting the very slightly hypnotic effect of the drug. Roughly half of the patients showed a considerable widening of the visual field, thought to be related to the stimulation of attention caused by Camazepam. Finally the lack of muscle relaxing properties of Camazepam was confirmed as regards the extraocular muscles, since their balance remained uninfluenced as well.", 
    "35": "Animal studies indicate that diazepam suppresses resting activity in the vestibular system. Despite lack of clinical studies, diazepam and lorazepam have been used empirically for relief of vertigo. However, drug use with benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) is controversial which led to this study to evaluate the value of diazepam and lorazepam for relief of BPV. Twenty-five BPV patients were given diazepam, lorazepam, or a placebo over four weeks using a double-blind technique. Each patient rated his dizziness after each week, and the patient's nystagmus was rated before and after treatment. The result showed a gradual decline in symptoms in all treatment groups with no additional relief with the drugs. The latter was attributed to the fact that BPV represents a dynamic state whereas diazepam provides symptom relief due to action on the system in its static state.", 
    "36": "Sixty-nine (9.2%) of 750 consecutive persons entering a chemical-dependence treatment hospital had urinary evidence of benzodiazepines, a somewhat higher proportion than in the general adult American population. The 54 subjects in whose urine benzodiazepines, but not the other commonly abused psychoactive drugs, were detected, had varied clinical findings. One had used benzodiazepines only, 38 others were alcoholic benzodiazepine users, and 15 were multiple-drug (including benzodiazepines) users. Of these 54 only 6 (11%) developed major withdrawal symptoms. All 6 had used high doses of benzodiazepines (larger than or equal to 30 mg of diazepam or equivalent) daily. The risk of major withdrawal symptoms was about 50% for the high benzodiazepines--heavy alcohol group and zero for all other benzodiazepine-consuming patients. While clinical vigilance regarding withdrawal is urged for all benzodiazepine consumers, it is especially important amongst alcoholics, consuming high doses of benzodiazepines.", 
    "37": "The synthesis of 7-(aminoacyl) and 7-(aminoalkyl) derivatives of 1,2,6,7-tetrahydroindolo[1,7-ab][1,5]benzodiazepines is described. These compounds were evaluated for antidepressant activity by their ability to inhibit tetrabenazine-induced ptosis in mice. Many compounds were found to be active in this animal model, and structure-activity relationships are discussed. Two analogues in particular, one from the 7-(aminoacyl) series (13) and one from the 7-(aminoalkyl) series (26), were of comparable potency to the antidepressant drugs desipramine and amitriptyline.", 
    "38": "The effect of i.v. lorazepam alone, in doses of 2 mg and 4 mg, and combined with morphine 5 mg, were studied. Sedation, relief of anxiety, lack of recall, patient acceptance, physician acceptance and side-effects were evaluated. The addition of morphine to lorazepam significantly improved sedation and relief of anxiety. Physician acceptance and patient acceptance showed no significant difference between any of the combinations. Lack of recall was enhanced by increasing the dose of lorazepam from 2 mg to 4 mg, independent of the addition of morphine. The only significant side-effect was restlessness which occurred in 15% of patients receiving lorazepam 4 mg and 3% of patients receiving lorazepam 2 mg, again independent of the addition of morphine.", 
    "39": "The effects of the oral administration of diazepam 5, 10 and 20 mg, flunitrazepam 0.5 and 1 mg and lorazepam 1, 2 and 4 mg on memory were studied in groups of healthy patients before surgery. The degree of sedation was noted also. A dose-related amnesic effect was produced by all the drugs, but this was not significant with diazepam 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg. Larger doses of diazepam (10 and 20 mg) produced brief amnesia comparable to equivalent doses of flunitrazepam (0.5 and 1 mg). There was the same delay in the onset of amnesia after oral lorazepam 4 mg as when it was given i.v. and its effect lasted for at least 90 min after administration. In contrast to the effect of the same drugs given i.v., drowsiness and failure of recognition follow a similar time course.", 
    "40": "Serum samples from 201 drivers who presented at emergency departments within six hours after being injured in a road accident and 325 control drivers selected randomly at petrol stations were screened for drugs by combined thin-layer and gas chromatography. Blood alcohol concentrations were also measured, and a questionnaire on the subjects' state of health and use of drugs administered. At interview 30 patients (15%) and 44 controls (13%) said that they had taken drugs in the previous 24 hours. Four patients (2%) and six controls (2%) said that they had taken psychotropic drugs, but serum analysis detected psychotropic drugs in 10 patients (5%) and eight controls (2.5%). Diazepam was found in 16 of the 18 subjects in whom psychotropic drugs were detected. Alcohol was detected in 30 patients (15%) and three controls (1%). Drug use appeared to be somewhat lower in Finland than in other Western countries, and illness to be a more important traffic hazard than drugs in general. Interview was not a reliable method of establishing whether drivers had taken psychotropic drugs. Taking diazepam may increase the risk of being involved in a traffic accident, but alcohol was the most powerful risk factor.", 
    "41": "A previous therapeutic trial of factorial design showed that a combination of a psychotropic drug, a smooth-muscle relaxant, and a bulk former (lorazepam, hyoscine hydrobromide, and ispaghula husk) relieved symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome more effectively than the same agents given singly. Another trial of similar design was undertaken to compare each of these three agents with another having the equivalent clinical actions--namely, Motival (fluphenazine/nortriptylene mixture), mebeverine, and bran. Ninety-six patients took part; all received three agents, one from each of the three pairs being compared, and no placebos were used. Fifty-six patients reported a sustained symptomatic improvement, which was a significantly higher incidence than in the previous trial, when placebos were used. Ispaghula was significantly more effective than bran. The combination of ispaghula, Motival, and mebeverine improved 11 out of 12 patients--significantly more than bran, Motival, and hyoscine (five improved), or bran, lorazepam, and mebeverine (four improved). Mebeverine was significantly more effective when combined with Motival (18 out of 24 improved) than with lorazepam (10 improved). These results confirm the value of a combined therapeutic approach to the relief of the irritable bowel syndrome and suggest the possibility of synergism between agents.", 
    "42": "The hypnotic effects of triazolam (Halcion) 0.25 mg and flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) 2 mg were compared in a randomized double-blind crossover study of 55 surgical patients in the preoperative stage. At these doses there was no significant difference between the two benzodiazepines regarding duration of sleep, depth of sleep and interruption of sleep. Sleep induction time was significantly shorter with Rohypnol, whereas waking was far pleasanter for patients after Halcion. The absence of hangover after Halcion is significant.", 
    "43": "There is little evidence to warrant the long term prescribing of benzodiazepine as anxiolytics and there is an urgent need for research into the long term effects of these drugs. Benzodiazepine abuse with dependence and serious withdrawal symptoms is increasingly recognised as a major problem. Various studies show that the benzodiazepines can release aggressive impulses and that serious disinhibition can result from their use. Their suicidogenic potential in depressed patients is part of this disinhibiting effect. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepines especially in combination with alcohol render individuals accident prone. Cognitive defects are being increasingly recognised in benzodiazepine users. While these are reversible in short term users the question as to whether long term users suffer an increasing dementia urgently requires further research.", 
    "44": "The effects of GABA and diazepam on the spontaneous and potassium-evoked release of 3H-5-HT from rat hippocampal synaptosomes, preloaded by incubation with 3H-5-HT, have been investigated. Both GABA and diazepam independently increased the spontaneous release of 5-HT whereas they blocked the calcium-dependent, potassium-evoked release. However diazepam antagonised the GABA-mediated increase in spontaneous release but enhanced the inhibitory effects of GABA on potassium-stimulated release. The results suggest that 5-HT release in the hippocampus is under the presynaptic control of GABA and that diazepam may selectively enhance the inhibitory effect of GABA on the evoked release of 5-HT.", 
    "45": "Thoracic endoscopic sympathectomy (TES) is a short surgical procedure used for the treatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. It involves pneumothorax, the lateral and head up position, and necessitates minimal chest excursions during breathing, so that a special type of anaesthesia is required. In 13 patients two different methods were compared and blood gas analysis as well as circulatory parameters were studied. We therefore propose an anaesthetic method using controlled mechanical ventilation; relaxation; intravenous anaesthesia; at least 1 1 fluid replacement; and careful monitoring.", 
    "46": "Hydrolytic reactions of nimetazepam and nitrazepam in acidic solutions at body temperature were studied spectrophotometrically. The open-ring compounds produced by hydrolysis were in equilibrium with the corresponding closed-ring compounds (protonated nimetazepam and nitrazepam). Forward-reaction rate constants of both drugs were greater than the rate constant of diazepam. In nimetazepam, the forward-reaction rate constant was smaller than the reverse-reaction rate constant; in nitrazepam, the reverse-reaction rate constant was much smaller than the forward-reaction rate constant, and possible amide bond cleavage was indicated. The activation energies of the forward and reverse reactions of nimetazepam and the forward reaction of nitrazepam were calculated from Arrhenius-type plots, whereas no clear temperature dependency was observed in the reverse-reaction rate constant of nitrazepam. The effect of pH on these reactions also was examined. In addition, the pKa values of nimetazepam and nitrazepam were calculated to be 2.53 and 2.77, respectively.", 
    "47": "Generalized myoclonia of spinal origin was induced by creating the generator of pathologically enhanced excitation (GPEE) in the propriospinal neuronal system of the anterior horns of the rat spinal cord. The syndrome is characterized by paroxysms in the regimen of clonic and tonic activity, bearing resemblance to the epileptiform neuronal discharges in epilepsy. This finding allows the syndrome to be considered as experimental epilepsy at the spinal cord level. Antiepileptic drugs (diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine, diazepam) had a suppressive action on the clonic convulsive discharges, decreasing their frequency or eliminating them completely. The induced tonic electric activity was found to be resistant to these drugs. Only diazepam in large doses eliminated all types of the convulsive activity because of its sedative effect. The results obtained may be explained by both the specificity of the effect of antiepileptic drugs and features of the morphofunctional organization of hyperactive determinant structures of the generator itself and the whole pathological system.", 
    "48": "Three children received 1000 times the prescribed dose of atropine sulphate and recovered from the main effects of excitatory behaviour and hallucinations in 48 hours. Diazepam was effective in the control of this behaviour. It is suggested that physostigmine should be available where atropine and hyoscine are used or where overdoses are managed.", 
    "49": "Effects of d-amphetamine (AM), chlorpromazine (CPZ) and diazepam (DZ) on schedule controlled responding (lever-pressing) and adjunctive drinking under a fixed interval (FI) 1.5 min schedule of food reinforcement in rats were investigated. The drinking was measured with a drinkometer and a lickometer. AM 0.13--1.0 mg/kg SC increased the total responses, and decreased the total amount of drinking and licking counts dose-dependently. A marked response increase in the early portion (0.30 sec component of the FI) and mid portion (30--60 sec component), and decrease of the drinking in the mid portion and terminal portion (60--90 sec component) occurred. CPZ 0.25--2.0 mg/kg SC decreased responses, drinking and licking in proportion with the doses. After CPZ, a response decrease in the mid and terminal portions was observed, but not in the early portion. Higher doses of CPZ decreased the drinking and licking in the whole range of the interval. A small dose of DZ (0.25 mg/kg SC) produced a significant response increase. Higher doses of DZ also increased responding, but the change was not significant. The drinking and licking were suppressed by DZ. A dose-related response increase in the mid portion was observed after DZ, but not in the early and terminal portions except after 0.25 mg/kg. Higher doses of DZ (more than 0.5 mg/kg) decreased drinking and licking throughout the whole range of the FI. The present results suggest that the interpellet distribution of responding, drinking and licking, as well as their total values, yield important information when assessing drug effects on FI responding and adjunctive drinking in rats.", 
    "50": "The mechanism of the interaction between ethanol and diazepam is not known. Six healthy male subjects (aged 21 to 32 yr) were randomly assigned in a balanced crossover study to each of two treatments, 28 days apart: (1) diazepam 10 mg intravenously over 20 min, preceded by 60 min with ethanol 0.7 gm/kg (diluted to 20% v/v) orally over 15 min and followed for 8 hr by ethanol 0.15 gm/kg/hr to maintain the blood alcohol concentrations between 800 to 1,000 mg/l; (2) diazepam 10 mg intravenously over 20 min. The area under the curve (AUC) for total diazepam increased in all subjects (30.1 +/- 10.7%, mean = SD, p < 0.02) after ethanol. Since AUCfree diazepam also rose in all (mean - 26.5 +/- 17.3%) and AUC of the metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam fell (mean = 50.5 +/- 11.7%, p < 0.01) there had been inhibition of hepatic intrinsic clearance of free drug. The susceptibility of individuals to inhibition of N-desmethylation by ethanol is qualitatively determined by total drug concentrations. Estimation of free diazepam concentration coupled with measurement of metabolite affords a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the mechanism of this interaction.", 
    "51": "We have studied the influence of intravenously administered diazepam on the horizontal (HVOR) and vertical (VVOR) vestibulo-ocular reflexes of the rabbit. The HVOR and VVOR were evoked by sinusoidal oscillation of rabbits on a rate table (0.01 to 0.8 Hz, +/- 10 degrees), and eye movements were measured with an infrared light-projection technique. The gains of the HVOR and VVOR (evoked eye velocity/head velocity) were reduced by diazepam injections of 5 microgram/kg. The dose required to produce a 50% reduction in HVOR gain was 500 microgram/kg. The time required to reduce the HVOR gain to 50% of its maximal reduction at dose of 400 microgram/kg (0.4 Hz +/- 10 degrees) was 60 s. These data suggest that diazepam might be effective as an anti-motion-sickness agent.", 
    "52": "Patients who undergo cardiac catheterization are frequently taking propranolol and are often premedicated with diazepam. Because the intensity of a drug's action is determined by free, or non-protein-bound, levels in plasma, changes in the degree of protein binding may profoundly alter the pharmacologic effect. We examined the effects of heparin on the free levels of propranolol and diazepam in six patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. After heparinization, the free fraction of diazepam increased more than fourfold, from 1.8 +/- 0.1% to 7.9 +/- 1.2% (p < 0.002) and the free levels increased from 2.0 +/- 0.5 to 8.4 +/- 2.2 ng/ml (p < 0.025); the free fraction of propranolol increased from 7.4 +/- 0.9% to 12.5 +/- 1.4% (p < 0.001). The increase in free drug concentration was associated with elevated free fatty acid levels, which rose from 181 +/- 7 micrograms/ml to 596 +/- 119 micrograms/ml (p < 0.02). Increases in the free levels of propranolol and diazepam produced by heparinization during cardiac catheterization may result in increased pharmacolaogic effect, such as excessive sedation or respiratory depression.", 
    "53": "Genetic, clinical, polyphysiographic and therapeutical aspects were investigated in a 37 year old patient suffering from: sporadic and localized segmentary myoclonia (present during rest and increasing slightly during movement), cerebellar syndrome, marked hypoacusia, hyper-reflexia of the lower limbs, spike and polyspike EEG discharges and massive myoclonia during photostimulation. A dominant autosomic inheritance of this syndrome was suggested by the occurrence of a more serious and rapid, yet similar, illness in the mother and by EEG alterations in an 8 year old son. The Authors suggest that, from the clinical point of view, they are dealing with an atypical Ramsay-Hunt syndrome (MCD) with signs of Pierre-Marie Heredoataxia. This supports the possibility, however rare, of intermediate forms between MCD and Heredoataxia. The patient underwent polyphysiographic investigations under the following conditions: i) without therapy; ii) with diphenylhydantoin; iii) with phenobarbital; iv) with sodium dipropyl-acetate; v) with clonazepam. The above investigations confirmed the previously described alterations, during wakefulness or sleep, observed in cases of Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (PME) and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome (MCD). Clonazepam was found to be the most effective drug in attenuating myoclonia, in reducing the EEG spike activity and in reorganizing the phases and cycles of sleep.", 
    "54": "Effects of a dodecapeptide containing the gamma-MSH sequence on two types of conditioned behaviors were investigated. This peptide enhanced the avoidance response in poorly-performing mice, while it suppressed the self-stimulation lever pressing in rats. At higher doses, the peptide induced slight convulsions of a myoclonic type. The significance of these behavioral changes has not been assessed, but the results suggest that gamma-MSH may have some physiological function in the central nervous system.", 
    "55": "Distal colon motility studies performed in 41 psychotic subjects demonstrated that 32 of them had hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system at this peripheral level, while the remaining nine cases showed hyperactivity of the dopaminergic system. The noradrenergic-hyperactive patients fulfilled the Research Diagnostic Criteria of schizophrenia, whereas the dopaminergic-hyperactive patients were diagnosed as having schizoaffective disorders. Noradrenergic-hyperactive subjects were successfully treated with clonidine, a drug which inhibits release of noradrenaline, while dopaminergic-hyperactive subjects were successfully treated with clonazepam, a drug which inhibits release of dopamine. The addition of sulpiride (a postsynaptic dopaminergic blocking agent) and of phentolamine (a postsynaptic noradrenergic blocking agent) to clonidine and clonazepam, respectively, induced further significant improvements in both types of psychotic patients.", 
    "56": "1 Mice in small groups develop a despotic type of social hierarchy, a feature of which is to resist alteration through the medium of psychotropic drugs. This makes a rapid pharmacologically induced change in the social hierarchy impossible. 2 Patrolling the territory and a certain level of social interaction are both critical factors in maintaining the phenomenon of inertia in the social hierarchy. Psychotropic drugs (diazepam, droperidol and mescaline) altered both these factors to a varying degree and also displayed a differing ability to maintain the inertia of the social hierarchy. 3 A drug-induced alteration in the level of aggression in a subordinate mouse in a group of three does not cause an alteration in its social position. 4 Chronic administration of diazepam, droperidol or mescaline, all of which alter the level of aggression in different ways, can result in an inversion of the social hierarchy where a competitive rival is present in the group of mice. The rate of inversion of the social hierarchy depends on the type of pre-existing social hierarchy. 5 It is suggested that the ability of psychotropic drugs to maintain the inertia of the hierarchy be used as an index of their effect upon certain types of species-specific behaviour; in particular aggression.", 
    "57": "A retrospective survey of the sedation requirements of the last 50 patients needing ventilation in a provincial Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) showed a wide variation in regimes used. The results were more random than expected: some patients were given six drugs for control of ventilation. There was greater reliance on pancuronium than anticipated. Patients' requirements varied greatly, as did each individual's daily requirements. The need to ensure adequate sedation is emphasised.", 
    "58": "Recent clinical investigations and reports of theoretical models have provided considerable insight into mechanisms of hepatic drug elimination and into derangements that may occur in drug absorption and disposition in patients with hepatic disease. Carefully conducted and well controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that hepatic disease may alter substantially one or more pharmacokinetic parameters of drug absorption and disposition. Physiological models of hepatic drug elimination have emphasised the importance of physiological variables such as hepatic blood flow, protein binding and intrinsic clearance of the liver on hepatic drug elimination. Both clinical investigations and theoretical considerations have indicated that the influence of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of a drug may be complex and may result in either unchanged, retarded or even accelerated drug elimination. Changes in response to drugs in patients with hepatic impairment add to this complexity. Although general guidelines may be formulated now to assist clinicians in constructing dosage regimens of several important drug classes (notably the benzodiazepines and barbiturates) in hepatic disease, it is not now possible to predict in an individual the influence of a specific hepatic disease on the disposition of a drug, with the exception that the oral availability of drugs with high hepatic extraction ratios is increased in patients with cirrhosis and protacaval shunting of blood. Attempts to correlate concentrations of endogenous substances (such as bilirubin), or the pharmacokinetics of model drugs (such as antipyrine), with the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are useful in patients with hepatic impairment have not resulted in clinically useful tests of hepatic drug elimination. Following the administration of a drug to a patient with hepatic impairment, careful monitoring of the patient and also monitoring of plasma or blood drug concentrations remain important considerations.", 
    "59": "It has been suggested that reversal of stress-induced tachycardia by beta-adrenergic blockade might be of benefit in the treatment of phobias. This was tested in a double-blind cross-over trial by exposing 22 female volunteers with spider or snake phobias to their phobic object 1 1/2 hours after administration of either tolamolol 200 mg, diazepam 10 mg or placebo. Although tolamolol abolished the stress-induced tachycardia, it had no beneficial behavioural or subjective effects. In contrast, diazepam, which had no significant effect on heart rate, improved behavioural performance. Subjective measures were more influenced by order effect than by medication.", 
    "60": "The pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of desmethyldiazepam 20 mg or oxazepam 50 mg were studied in 5 healthy volunteers under controlled conditions, before and following a 24 h pretreatment with cimetidine 200 mg x 5. Cimetidine significantly impaired (p = 0.03) the elimination of desmethyldiazepam, as shown prolongation of its elimination half-life from 51.7 +/- 21.9 h to 72.6 +/- 39.4 h (mean +/- SD), and a decrease in total plasma clearance from 12.0 +/- 2.7 ml/min to 8.6 +/- 3.3 ml/min. The disposition of oxazepam was not affected. From these results, and recently published data on diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, it is concluded that cimetidine impairs the hepatic elimination of those benzodiazepines which are metabolized by phase I reactions.", 
    "61": "Cystometric recordings were performed in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats and the effects of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) mechanisms on urinary bladder function were evaluated as their influence on a bladder hyperactivity induced by 1-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) after peripheral decarboxylase inhibition. The bladder response was inhibited by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v., 4th ventricle) injections of GABA (250 microgram), muscimol (0.2 microgram) and glycine (1,000 microgram) as well as by systemically administered muscimol (4 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg). Intravenous (i.v.) bicuculline, but not i.v. strychnine, antagonized the inhibitory actions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) and i.c.v. muscimol and i.v. diazepam while the opposite was true for the inhibitory action of i.c.v. glycine. In rats not pretreated with L-DOPA, i.p. administration of bicuculline (4 mg/kg) after 15 min caused prominent detrusor contractions that were prevented by an infracollicular brain transection. It is suggested that GABA synapses in the pontinemesencephalic brain region may be involved in the modulation of urinary bladder function.", 
    "62": "[3H]Diazepam binds to preparations of membranes from chicken retina. Two binding sites were detected; a high affinity site (KD, 1.8 nM and Bmax, 0.17 pmol/mg retina protein) and a low affinity site (KD, 132 nM and Bmax, 1.46 pmol/mg retinal protein). GABA stimulated [3H]diazepam binding to these retinal membranes. One week after injection of kainic acid into the eye, which destroys the horizontal and amacrine cells of the retina, the low affinity site disappeared, while the level of the high affinity site was hardly affected. These results establish that chicken retina contains benzodiazepine receptors, which are closely associated with GABA receptors. The benzodiazepine receptors are probably associated with horizontal and/or amacrine cell synapses which use GABA as a transmitter.", 
    "63": "The infantile spasms syndrome appeared on the same day in a pair of monozygotic twins at age 6 months. Clinical, electroencephalographic, and neuroradiological findings during the development of the disease are reported. One of the twins was treated with ACTH and in his case clinical and electroencephalographic improvement was more rapid than in the other who was treated with clonazepam. While the computer tomography scan initially showed in each twin an area of low density in the right fronto-parietal region, this had disappeared in the tomograms obtained about 8 months later.", 
    "64": "This four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessed the new benzodiazepine derivative alprazolam (Xanax) treatment of moderate to severe anxiety characteristic of anxiety neurosis. Sixty-two outpatients participated; 8 per cent of those taking drug and 52 per cent of those taking placebo discontinued participation due to side effects or lack of efficacy. The mean total daily alprazolam dose was 1.35 mg taken in divided doses. Alprazolam significantly improved scores on five anxiety rating scales--Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Physician's Global Impressions, Target Symptoms Record, Self-Rating Symptom Scale, and Patient's Global Impressions. Alprazolam patients experienced no clinically significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values; they reported drowsiness as the most frequent side effect. We conclude that alprazolam is an effective and safe anxiolytic agent."
