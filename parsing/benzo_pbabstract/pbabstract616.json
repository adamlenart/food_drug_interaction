    "0": "It has been shown that the tranquilizers, diazepam (a 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative) and mebicar (a derivative of bicyclic bisureas) produce one-line inhibition of the production of the conditioned reflex of active avoidance in rats and of their \"open-field\" motor activity. Both the drugs change the balance of neuroactive amino acids in the animals' brain. However they produce different changes: diazepam increases the content of asparaginic and glutamic acids, while mebicar raises that of gamma-butyric acid. No interrelationship was found between psychotropic and vegetotropic effects of the tranquilizers.", 
    "1": "The interaction of [3H]flunitrazepam with benzodiazepine receptors in rat brain homogenates was studied in the presence of 2 micro M endogenous GABA at 0 degrees at pH 7.2. Equilibrium binding experiments showed a dominant component of high affinity with an equilibrium dissociation constant K = 0.86 +/- 0.07 nM which accounted for 75% of total binding and another component of lower affinity (K = 30 nM). The dissociation kinetics of the [3H]flunitrazepam complex at the high affinity site were strictly monophasic with a rate constant Koff = (7.7 +/- 0.3 X 10(-4)/sec. The association kinetics with the high affinity sites were studied with ligand concentrations [L]0 in large excess over binding sites. The kinetics were in accordance with a single exponential with a reaction rate r-1. In the higher concentration range [L]0 greater than or equal to 10 nM, r-1 as a function of [L]0 deviated from linearity and started to level off. The data are compatible with a two-step mechanism where R and L rapidly combine to form a pre-complex RL which then slowly isomerizes to the final complex C: (see formula in text) where K1 = ([R][L]/([RL] and [RL]/[C] = k-2/k2 = k2. Nonlinear parameter estimation yielded K1 = 24.2 +/- 7.1 nM, k2 = (2.8 +/- 0.5) X 10(-2)/sec and K-2 = (9 +/- 2) X 10(-4)/sec. The isomerization step might reflect ligand-induced conformation change of the high affinity site which is involved in the potentiation of GABA-ergic transmission produced by the benzodiazepines.", 
    "2": "In eight bipolar depressives, 11 unipolar depressives, and 15 healthy controls urinary excretion of MHPG was measured at 3-h intervals over one 24-h period. Bipolars excreted smaller amounts of MHPG than unipolars and controls, especially at night. MHPG excretion was significantly dependent on time of day in the control group only. In the patients maximum excretion showed a tendency to occur earlier in the day than in controls. Minima were unaffected. There were indications that tricyclic antidepressants advance MHPG phases.", 
    "3": "We have prepared a series of tetrahydro-beta-carbolines (TH beta C), beta-carbolines (beta-C), and other nitrogen heterocycles and evaluated them in vitro with respect to their ability to bind to benzodiazepine receptors. The fully aromatic beta-C's were more potent than their corresponding TH beta C derivatives. When substituents possessing a carbonyl (CO2Me, COCH3, CHO) were introduced at the beta-C 3-position the in vitro potency was augmented. Alcohol substituents (CH2OH, CHOHCH3) demonstrated decreased in vitro potency. The importance of the carbonyl moiety was further demonstrated when beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid was shown to bind tighter to benzodiazepine receptors at lower pH. A lower pH increases the concentration of the acid and decreases the concentration of the anion. 3-(Hydroxymethyl)-beta-carboline (24), 3-formyl-beta-carboline (25) and 3-acetyl-beta-carboline (27) were benzodiazepine antagonists in vivo. Methyl isoquinoline-3-carboxylate (31a) also had in vitro activity. The same structure-activity relationships seen in beta-C's were also observed for isoquinolines.", 
    "4": "The syntheses of 2-amino-N-(2-benzoyl)-4-chlorophenyl)acetamides are reported. The pharmacological properties of these compounds were compared with data obtained from the corresponding cyclized products [5-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones]. Evidence is presented which suggests that the central nervous system activity observed for 1,4-benzodiazepines is inherent only in the closed seven-membered ring and is not due to the ring-opened form.", 
    "5": "Temazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative indicated for the treatment of insomnia. Pharmacokinetic studies of the hard capsule formulation indicate that the mean time to peak is 2.99 hours and the mean elimination half-life is 14.7 hours. Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated improvements in all sleep parameters except sleep onset latency. Clinically, patients report improvements in all sleep parameters including sleep onset latency. The efficacy of temazepam compares favorably with barbiturates, glutethimide, nitrazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, and flurazepam. It has not been compared with diazepam in the clinical setting. Side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and lethargy. The incidence of hangover effects from 15- and 30-mg doses is relatively low. Temazepam has no proven advantages over other benzodiazepine hypnotics. The major issues that need further clarification include temazepam's sleep induction properties and the relative incidence of hangover and rebound insomnia when compared with longer-acting benzodiazepines.", 
    "6": "In a double-blind randomized study midazolam 15 mg and flunitrazepam 2 mg caused a significantly better night's sleep than placebo. Midazolam had a moderate sedative effect the following morning but, in other respects studied, no residual effects were found. In contrast, flunitrazepam decreased both the degree of apprehension and excitement the following morning. Flunitrazepam also inhibited salivary secretion and caused less cardiovascular changes than placebo or midazolam. The dose of thiopentone needed for induction of anaesthesia was significantly lower in those given flunitrazepam. The results show that midazolam is a potent sedative agent with a short duration of action.", 
    "7": "The efficacy and safety of clobazam and diazepam were compared in 40 patients with generalized anxiety disorder in a 28 day non-placebo-controlled trial followed by a 3-day single-blind placebo washout. The two drugs were equally anxiolytic, and the anxiety symptoms of most patients were brought under control within 1 week. Both drugs were found to be nontoxic. Diazepam had slightly greater sedative properties than clobazam, which was the patients' preferred drug after 28 days of treatment. During placebo washout, anxiety returned to pretreatment levels. Abrupt withdrawal did not result in rebound phenomena.", 
    "8": "The antihistaminic activity of many antidepressant drugs is well documented in vitro but has not been investigated as thoroughly in vivo. In the course of an investigation of the roles of H1 and H2 receptors in histamine-induced adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release in rats, it was observed that several antidepressants were potent inhibitors of this response. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with test drugs and then with histamine or histamine agonists. Serum ACTH concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. ACTH secretion was induced by both H1 and H2 receptor stimulation. Histamine-induced ACTH release was markedly attenuated by several H1 antihistamines, whereas the H2 antagonists were not as effective. The antidepressants imipramine, doxepin, mianserin, desipramine and amitriptyline suppressed histamine-induced ACTH release. However, iprindole and the antianxiety agent diazepam were without effect. ACTH release induced by histamine agonists was also diminished by pretreatment with some of these blocking agents.", 
    "9": "In mice and rats, the high affinity ligand for brain benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors beta-CCE, and the more stable congener FG 7142, failed to exert anticonflict activity in conflict situations but instead reversed the anticonflict effect of lorazepam. In contrast to Ro 15-1788, beta-CCE and FG 7142 also antagonized the anticonflict effect of phenobarbital in rats. This effect suggests that beta-CCE and FG 7142 may produce anxiety by either inducing a conformational change in the BZ receptors which is directly opposite to that induced by the benzodiazepines, or binding to a particular subclass of BZ receptors.", 
    "10": "Intracellular recordings from mouse spinal neurons grown dissociated in tissue culture were used to study the effects of the water soluble benzodiazepine, flurazepam, upon neuronal excitability. Low concentrations of this drug (1 pM to 10 nM) depressed excitability in three distinctly different ways: (1) by directly increasing Cl- conductance, (2) by potentiating responses to GABA, and (3) by elevating spike threshold and/or depressing repetitive spike firing. Bathing neurons with picrotoxin induced 'convulsive-like' activity which was attenuated by flurazepam. The direct effects of flurazepam on the passive and active properties of membrane excitability were insensitive to picrotoxin. However, when the dose of flurazepam was increased to 10 nM or greater this drug lost its effectiveness. These results show that flurazepam is a potent drug with multiple sites of action all of which are likely to contribute to its pharmacological actions in vivo.", 
    "11": "Diazepam (100-133 mg/kg/day), administered chronically through a gastric fistula, and pentobarbital (ca 692 mg/kg/day), administered chronically in food, were studied for their dependence producing properties in Sprague-Dawley female rats. The diazepam abstinence syndrome was apparent 10 to 20 hours after withdrawal, persisted for over 60 hours and consisted of poker tail, explosive awakenings, digging in sawdust, jerks, tremors, wet dog shakes, hostility, decreased food and water consumption and weight loss. The pentobarbital abstinence syndrome came on rapidly peaking within 10 hours and was largely over by 16 hours. The pentobarbital abstinence syndrome differed from diazepam's by the presence of grand mal, clonic and atypical convulsions. Diazepam completely and in a dose related way suppressed the diazepam abstinence syndrome. Similarly pentobarbital suppressed the pentobarbital abstinence syndrome. The signs which could be suppressed in a dose related manner were different for the diazepam and pentobarbital abstinence syndromes. Diazepam only partially suppressed the pentobarbital abstinence syndrome and pentobarbital only partially suppressed the diazepam abstinence syndrome. These data indicate that diazepam and pentobarbital produce different types of dependencies in the rat and are not equivalent in suppressing signs of abstinence.", 
    "12": "A benzodiazepine antagonist, RO15-1788, was administered intragastrically to diazepam-dependent gastric fistula rats and a precipitated abstinence syndrome was observed. The intensity of the RO15-1788 precipitated abstinence syndrome, calculated by the Precipitated Abstinence Scale, increased in intensity in a log-dose manner over a dose range of 1.0 to 15.0 mg/kg of RO15-1788 and plateaued at the 15.0 mg/kg dose. The RO15-1788 precipitated diazepam abstinence syndrome differed both qualitatively and quantitatively from the diazepam withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "13": "Withdrawal of anxiolytic agents such as ethanol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines may result in a syndrome characterised in its most severe form by delirium and seizures. There is increasing evidence that anxiolytic drugs produce their pharmacological effects by enhancing brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission. During long-term exposure to anxiolytics, brain GABA synapses show evidence of adaptive changes which would tend to reduce the effect of the anxiolytic and restore normal GABA function. Abrupt cessation of anxiolytic treatment might therefore lead to an acute reduction in GABA function; this change could underlie the severe symptoms associated with tranquilliser withdrawal.", 
    "14": "In the last five years some 8 in 100 000 people in Switzerland died by poisoning. The majority (74-82%) were suicides, but 14-20% were classified as accidental death. About 40% of all cases involved poisoning by drugs. The most frequent fatal poisons were hypnotics. Among the serious cases reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Center or admitted to hospital (VESKA statistics), poisonings by combinations of drugs were the most frequent, followed by overdoses of sleeping tablets, analgesics and psychoactive drugs. In children the most frequent causes were analgesics and sleeping tablets. The bromocarbamide poisonings of the early seventies were largely replaced by overdoses of benzodiazepine sleeping preparations and prescription-free barbiturate- and diphenhydramine-containing preparations. In Swiss hospitals the mortality from poisoning by drugs was 1.5%.", 
    "15": "Eighty three patients who were comatose or confused due to intoxication with various drugs were treated repeatedly with 2 mg doses of physostigmine until maximal neurological improvement or side effects appeared. During therapy special attention was paid to the level of consciousness (Glasgow coma score) and to the general cardiorespiratory state. According to the main drug ingested the patients were divided into the following groups: anticholinergic (35 patients), benzodiazepine (12 patients), non-anticholinergic (22 patients) and unclassified (14 patients). The best antidotal effect of physostigmine was in the anticholinergic group (91%) and in the benzodiazepine group (67%), whereas in the non-anticholinergic and in the unclassified group only 32% and 50% of the patients, respectively, showed any improvement in mental condition during the physostigmine application. After the antidotal therapy, relapses occurred in 21/32 patients in the anticholinergic group, whereas the figures for the benzodiazepine and the non-anticholinergic groups were only 2/8 and 0/7. Major side effects of physostigmine were noted in two patients, one had ventricular extrasystoles and the other an acute grand mal attack. In this series the diagnostic value of physostigmine was considerable, but the therapeutic benefit was limited.", 
    "16": "A simple method of estimating the extent of biliary recycling using blood level and cumulative biliary excretion data from control and bile duct-cannulated animals is described. The method was tested in rats following an intravenous dose of [14C] temazepam. It was shown that 62% of the drug excreted in the bile of control rats was reabsorbed during each enterohepatic cycle, contributing to the secondary peak blood concentrations and a prolonged elimination half-life.", 
    "17": "Distribution of nuclear ploidy in female mouse hepatocytes was measured cytofluorimetrically using ethidium-bromide-stained hepatocyte nuclei liberated by in situ collagenase perfusion of the liver via the portal vein. After i.v. administration of lead acetate or an i.p. general anaesthetic (Valium and Hypnorm), rapid shifts of 8N and 4N nuclei to lower ploidy levels were recorded. It was possible to block the ploidy changes with i.p. colchicine, although no blocked metaphases were observed histologically. These observations were consistent with an earlier report on changes in nuclear ploidy induced by carbon tetrachloride (Steele et al., 1981b). It is speculated that these changes in ploidy may represent an early response of the hepatocytes to stimulation--an aspect of liver behaviour of which we were not previously aware.", 
    "18": "Electrical stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex in rats daily for nine days caused a marked improvement in the rate of acquisition of a self-stimulation response. Diazepam (1 mg/kg, IP) or phenobarbital (15 mg/kg), but not phenytoin (25 mg/kg), administered during the nine day period of electrical stimulation, attenuated this facilitatory effect. However, diazepam or phenobarbital in the same dosages administered to self-stimulating rats (i.e., after acquisition) failed to alter responding. It was suggested that a kindling-like mechanism may underlie the development of self-stimulation of the prefrontal cortex.", 
    "19": "A novel antibiotic, prothracarcin was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces umbrosus subsp. raffinophilus DO-62. The antibiotic has the molecular formula of C14H14N2O and belongs to the pyrrolo [1,4]benzodiazepine antibiotics. Its structure has been elucidated by mass and NMR spectra. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and experimental murine tumor sarcoma 180 and leukemia P388.", 
    "20": "The pharmacokinetics of neothramycin (NTM) was performed in mice, rabbits and man. Biological half-life of NTM in man after a 20 mg bolus injection produced an alpha phase half-life of 3.63 minutes, a beta phase half-life of 84.5 minutes and a volume of distribution at a steady state of 50.3 liters/body. Its human half-life was longer than those of adriamycin, mitomycin C and neocarzinostatin, and a little shorter than that of bleomycin. In mice and rabbits, NTM was well distributed in the kidney, urinary bladder, squamous tissues, lung, spleen and gastrointestinal tract and it was rapidly excreted in urine and bile. It was partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Concentrations of NTM in ascites and pleural fluids in man were also reported.", 
    "21": "The ability of picrotoxin to reverse the effect of diazepam was studied using the conditioned defensive burying paradigm. Although picrotoxin alone had no detectable effect on the conditioned defensive burying response of rats, picrotoxin was able to reverse the usual inhibitory effect of diazepam on defensive burying. These results suggest that the anxiolytic effect of diazepam may depend upon the integrity of GABAergic neural systems.", 
    "22": "Diazepam has been used empirically for the relief of vertigo and, in addition, there are animal studies to suggest that this drug suppresses the vestibular system. One might anticipate therefore that diazepam would be an effective antimotion sickness drug. To study this, motion sickness was generated in four groups of normal subjects by having the subject make controlled head movements while rotating at constant velocity. Every subject was subjected (using a double-blind technique) to four different drug states, namely no drug, placebo, dimenhydrinate, and diazepam. Each group of subjects received the drug state at a different time interval (i.e. 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) prior to the motion sickness exposure. Motion sickness endpoints were measured subjectively using a nausea scale and objectively using a sweat sensor. The results showed significant antimotion sickness properties for both dimenhydrinate and diazepam as compared to the placebo. For the time intervals studied, the maximum effect was obtained at 120 min for both drugs.", 
    "23": "The determination of cardiac output by the Fick principle requires the quantitation of the arteriovenous oxygen (O2) content difference across the pulmonary bed and the O2 consumption. Since a correct measurement of O2 consumption may be difficult, an assumed value is sometimes substituted into this equation. Despite this practice, there is no appropriate reference standard for O2 consumption applicable to the adult catheterization laboratory. Therefore, we determined O2 consumption in 108 patients (69 men and 39 women, mean age, 49 years) at the time of catheterization by multiplying the arteriovenous content difference by the indicator dilution cardiac output, thereby eliminating errors related to the collection and analysis of the timed collection of expired air. O2 consumption index (O2 consumption/m2 of body surface area) averaged 126 +/- 26 ml/min/m2 (mean +/- SD), but there was wide variability(65-250 ml/Min/m2). O2 consumption was not affected by patient age or sex but was lower in those who were mildly sedated before catheterization (sedated, 121 +/- 22 ml/Min/m2; nonsedated, 132 +/- 28 ml/min/m2; p = 0.023). Thus, O2 consumption varies greatly among adults at the time of cardiac catheterization, so that any attempt at estimating this variable is fraught with major potential error.", 
    "24": "Influence of diazepam on the amplitude of the population spikes (PS) evoked in CA1 area by Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices was analyzed. Diazepam was diluted in Hanks solution used for slice incubation. Introduction of diazepam (3.96 X 10-6 M) into the medium led to a significant decrease in the PS amplitude. higher concentrations (3.96 X 10-5 M) resulted in augmentation of the population EPSP and in disappearance of the PS. The effects were reversible. It is concluded that diazepam inhibits the discharges of the population of CAl neurones.", 
    "25": "The effects of anaesthetics on mouse bone marrow colony growth in vitro were examined. The culture dishes were kept in boxes of stainless steel, so that the composition of the gas phase could easily be controlled. After 1 week of culturing, cell colonies were counted. The cells (macrophages and in one type of culture also granulocytes) were then washed out of the dishes and counted. Enflurane, as well as halothane, present in the gas phase at concentrations used clinically, decreased the number of colonies and cells in a dose-dependent fashion. However, intravenously administered drugs such as diazepam, fentanyl, alfentanyl, sufentanyl, thiopental and pentobarbital were not inhibitory at concentrations used in anaesthetic practice, but at least some of them depressed cell formation when high concentrations were used.", 
    "26": "The effects of diazepam (1 mg/kg), picrotoxin (1.5 mg/kg) and both treatments on hyponeophagia in male and female rats were studied. Diazepam reduced eating latency and enhanced the total amount eaten in the test. Picrotoxin increased approach and eating latencies and reduced amount eaten, females being more sensitive to these actions. Behavioural sensitivity to diazepam was reduced by picrotoxin for approach latency but enhanced for eating latency. These findings are discussed in connection with the GABA hypothesis of the actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "27": "Factors that contribute to the lethality of amitriptyline overdosage were studied in cats. Amitriptyline (50 mg/kg) given i.p. to unanesthetized cats produced convulsions in all of the animals and death in five of six animals; pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg) protected against the convulsions and death. Respiratory depression contributed to the mortality when amitriptyline was given i.v. in cats anesthetized with pentobarbital as indicated by the finding that artificial respiration delayed the time of death induced by a continuous i.v. infusion of the drug. The i.v. infusion of amitriptyline in pentobarbitalized cats under artificial respiration produced death due to cardiovascular collapse. The latter was characterized by hypotension, bradycardia, depression of myocardial contractile force, atrioventricular block, intraventricular conduction delay and cardiac arrhythmias. These effects appear to be due to a direct membrane (quindine-like) cardiotoxic action of amitriptyline. Dopamine and dobutamine were effective in protecting the animals against the acute cardiovascular collapse induced by amitriptyline. The protection was associated with a diminution of the hypotension, the negative inotropic and chronotropic actions and the incidence of atrioventricular block produced by the tricyclic antidepressant drug. The results suggest that the positive chronotropic, inotropic and dromotropic actions of the amines may all be contributory factors in their protection action. Isoproterenol and norepinephrine were less effective than the other two amines.", 
    "28": "The electroshock test-taking hind limb tonic extension as the end point-was carried out on the fifth day after the intracerebroventricular injections of kainic acid (KA; 0.2 microgram per mouse). The following antiepileptics were tested for the anticonvulsant effects both in naive and KA-lesioned mice: phenobarbital (20 mg/kg), diazepam (8 mg/kg), carbamazepine (15 mg/kg) and diphenylhydantoin (10 mg/kg), all drugs being injected intraperitoneally 60 min before electroconvulsions. It was found that the protective effects of phenobarbital and diazepam were distinctly reduced in KA-lesioned animals when compared to naive mice. However, both carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin protected KA-injected and control animals to a similar degree. Further, intracerebroventricular injections of KA resulted in the substantial loss of pyramidal cells in the whole CA3 field of the hippocampus. It is suggested that the intact hippocampus is necessary for the development of the full anticonvulsant effects of phenobarbital and diazepam, whilst the site of action of carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin is independent of the hippocampus.", 
    "29": "We assessed the effect of 30 mg of oral flurazepam on sleep-disordered breathing and nocturnal oxygen desaturation by performing a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Asymptomatic subjects, 17 men and three women (mean age 49 years, mean weight 79 kg), were monitored for two consecutive nights. Flurazepam was given to 10 subjects on night 1 and to 10 subjects on night 2. Placebo was ingested on the other nights. Polysomnographic determinations included chest wall movement by impedance pneumography, nasal and oral airflow by thermistor probes, and continuous oxygen saturation by ear oximetry. Flurazepam was associated with significant increases in the number of sleep events (p = 0.01), episodes of apnea (p less than 0.01), and total duration of apnea (p less than 0.01). The number of episodes of hypopnea of desaturation did not significantly increase, although the degree of desaturation increased after flurazepam ingestion (p = 0.04). Total sleep time significantly increased (p = 0.04), but could not account for the increased number of events. Sleep stage distribution was minimally altered by ingestion of flurazepam.", 
    "30": "We investigated the cardiovascular effects of intravenous thiopentone (3.0 mg/kg), etomidate (0.3 mg/kg), althesin (0.07 ml/kg), ketamine (1.5 mg/kg), diazepam (0.15 mg/kg) and flunitrazepam (0.015 mg/kg) alone and after the addition of fentanyl (0.01 mg/kg) during induction of anaesthesia in 46 premedicated patients subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery. Thiopentone, etomidate or diazepam caused only small changes in the haemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen supply and demand (arterial pressure, heart rate, left and right ventricular filling pressure) in patients with coronary artery disease in whom global resting left ventricular function was normal. Althesin and flunitrazepam produced a significant fall in arterial pressure, cardiac index and stroke index; heart rate increased after the administration of althesin. Ketamine markedly elevated systemic and pulmonary pressure, heart rate, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, right and left ventricular filling pressure. The subsequent administration of fentanyl was associated with a further decrease in arterial pressure in the althesin and flunitrazepam group. The circulatory stimulating effects of ketamine were largely abolished by fentanyl. None of the induction procedures was associated with cardiovascular stimulation during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.", 
    "31": "The cardiovascular effects of thiopentone 3 mg kg-1 and midazolam 0.3 mg kg-1 were observed during induction of anaesthesia in 16 premedicated patients about to undergo myocardial revascularization. There were no significant changes in either group in cardiac output or central venous pressure. The heart rate in both groups showed an increase at 3 min and thereafter returned to control values. After 3 min, there was a significant decrease in both arterial pressure and peripheral resistance by 12% and 15% (mean values) respectively from control values in the group receiving midazolam, whereas after thiopentone the peripheral resistance increased by approximately 13% and was not affected by a further dose of thiopentone 1 mg kg-1.", 
    "32": "1. From 1976 to 1980 858 patients with late gestoses were treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Wilhelm-Pieck-University of Rostock (6,9% from 12.519 deliveries). 2. The principles of therapy with appropriate dosage of drugs are discussed in comparison to other countries. 3. The sedative-anticonvulsive therapy of severe preeclampsia is based mainly on magnesium sulfate used both in the USA and in our clinic, but seldom in Sweden. In England the basic principles of the sedative therapy are benzodiazepines. 4. In treatment of preeclampsia antihypertensive drugs are usually applied only above blood pressure values of 160/110 mmHg. 5. Hydralazine is preferred in our clinic like in the USA, in England methyldopa and beta-blocking agents. Diazoxide is said to be the drug of choice in acute hypertensive crisis. 6. Since many years in severe cases with hemoconcentration we prefer a short-term plasma volume expansion by hypertonic osmotically and oncotically active solutions. This osmoonco-therapy may be applied before or simultaneously with the administration of antihypertensive drugs. But there are controversies in this mode of treatment. 7. In our clinic the maternal mortality of 79 eclampsias was 2,25% from 1959 to 1980.", 
    "33": "Desmethyldiazepam pharmacokinetics were determined after oral administration of its precursor, clorazepate, to 12 obese subjects (mean weight: 105.4 kg; mean percent ideal body weight: 170%) who were matched for age, sex, and smoking habits with 12 normal controls (66.5 kg; percent ideal body weight: 103.3%). After an overnight fast, a single 15-mg clorazepate capsule, equivalent to 10.3 mg of desmethyldiazepam, was administered. Multiple plasma samples drawn 10-42 days postdose were analyzed for desmethyldiazepam by electron-capture GLC. Obese subjects compared to controls had a prolonged desmethyldiazepam elimination half-life (t1/2) (154.1 hr versus 57.1 hr; p less than 0.005). Assuming quantitative conversion of clorazepate to desmethyldiazepam and 100% systemic availability, volume of distribution (Vd) was greatly increased in the obese (158.8 liters versus 63.3 liters; p less than 0.001). The value of Vd remained greater even after correction for body weight (1.52 liter/kg versus 0.94 liter/kg; p less than 0.005). However, clearance of desmethyldiazepam was not different between groups (13.2 ml/min in obese versus 13.4 ml/min in controls). The percent ideal body weight was highly correlated with Vd (r = 0.82), as was total body weight (r = 0.86). The value of t1/2 was correlated highly with Vd (r = 0.89) but only weakly with clearance (r = -0.38). Therefore, the large increase in the desmethyldiazepam t1/2 value seen in obese subjects is predominantly due to the disproportionate distribution of this lipid-soluble drug into body fat as opposed to lean tissue. The contribution of clearance to desmethyldiazepam t1/2 was of much less importance than was Vd in this obese study population.", 
    "34": "The pharmacokinetics of high-dose i.v. diazepam were studied in two patients in an intensive care unit. The first patient received up to 240 mg of diazepam daily for 21 days while the second received 60 mg daily for 30 days. Plasma concentrations of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, were very large but, despite severe underlying disease and simultaneous administration of several other drugs, the half-lives of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam washout were consistent with those found in healthy persons. Washout half-lives in the first patient were, if anything, shorter than expected, possibly caused by simultaneous administration of phenobarbitone. Thus the kinetics of diazepam are apparently not altered by administration of large doses.", 
    "35": "The 1.5-benzodiazepine (clobazam), the 1,4-benzodiazepine (diazepam), and two nonbenzodiazepine antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital and valproate) were evaluated in mice and rats with a battery of well-standardized anticonvulsant test procedures. The results obtained indicate that clobazam and valproate exhibit a wider range of experimental anticonvulsant activity than either diazepam or phenobarbital. Except for clobazam by the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test in rats, clobazam and valproate are effective in nontoxic doses against MES and all four chemically induced seizures (Metrazol, bicuculline, picrotoxin, and strychnine). Clobazam is effective by the MES test in rats only in doses that exceed the median minimal toxic dose. Phenobarbital is effective against all of the above tests, but minimal toxic doses must be employed to prevent strychnine seizures. Diazepam, on the other hand, is effective in nontoxic doses against seizures induced by Metrazol, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, but protects animals from maximal electroshock and strychnine seizures only when given in toxic doses. When compared on the basis of protective indices (PI = TD50/ED50) calculated from intraperitoneal data, the PIs for clobazam were 1.6 to 13 times higher than those for diazepam. Overall, except for the MES test in rats, the PIs for clobazam were from 1.5 to 44 times higher than those for any of the other three substances. With respect to the MES test in rats, the PI for clobazam was 10.8 times higher than that for diazepam; however, the PIs for phenobarbital and valproate were 3.5 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, than that for clobazam. These data suggest that the spectrum of anticonvulsant activity for the 1,5-benzodiazepine (clobazam) is superior to that for the 1,4-benzodiazepine (diazepam). Also, the broad experimental profile of anticonvulsant activity of clobazam agrees well with its reported broad clinical efficacy.", 
    "36": "Aldehyde reductase from ox kidney cytosol has been fractionated into four forms, two of which have been purified to apparent homogeneity. One of the minor forms is shown to be heterogenous on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The substrate specificities of the four forms using a variety of aldehydes and ketones are presented. The sensitivity of the various forms to inhibition by sodium valproate, sodium barbitone and various benzodiazepines has been determined. The relationship of these forms to the previously described hexonate dehydrogenase, aldose reductase and prostaglandin dehydrogenase is discussed.", 
    "37": "Significant retention deficits were observed on passive avoidance tasks (step-down and step-through) in 15-, 20-, and 25-month-old male C57BL/6 mice compared with 4- and 8-month-old mice. In contrast, cholinergic muscarinic receptor binding ( [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate) in cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum in these same animals revealed no difference in this 4- to 25-month age range. In a separate comparison of 4- and 29-month-old female mice, [3H]QNB binding was significantly decreased in the older group in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Environmental enrichment, compared with an impoverished environment, significantly improved retention in mice on 24-hr step-down performance but affected QNB binding only minimally (6-7% decrease of QNB binding in cerebral cortex and hippocampus). Benzodiazepine ( [3H]flunitrazepam) receptor binding was significantly (12-15%) decreased in 29-month-old mice compared with 4-month-old mice in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem.", 
    "38": "Benzodiazepines (diazepam, midazolam, flurazepam and chlordiazepoxide) produced a hyperdipsia in rats which were well-adapted to a daily 22 hr water-deprivation schedule. The hyperdipsia occurred as a result of extensions in the time-course of drinking without impairment in the efficiency of drinking (rate of water intake). At doses larger than those associated with hyperdipsia, the rate of water consumption was markedly impaired, so that any extension in the duration of drinking was offset by the impaired efficiency. As a result, a non-monotonic relationship between dose of benzodiazepine and volume of water intake could be generated. The convulsant benzodiazepine, Ro5-3663, produced a reduction in drinking, at sub-convulsant doses and without general motor interference. This hypodipsia was completely reversed by concurrent treatment with either diazepam or midazolam. The results are discussed in terms of possible behavioural and biochemical mechanisms which may underlie benzodiazepine-induced hyperdipsia.", 
    "39": "The pharmacokinetic parameters disposition half-life, metabolic clearance, volume of distribution, intrinsic clearance of unbound drug, and (distributive tissue volume/unbound fraction in tissue) were compared for 12 benzodiazepines in dog and man. With the exception of volume of distribution, statistically significant correlations were obtained when parameters were plotted on a double logarithmic grid. In general, benzodiazepines were metabolized more rapidly and exhibited greater tissue distribution in dog than in man. The variability in parameters was such, however, as to make extrapolations from one species to another subject to considerable error.", 
    "40": "In 29 experiments performed on relaxed cats with artificial respiration, the effects of 0.015; 0.03; 0.06 mg flunitrazepam per kg body weight i.v. with N2O basal anaesthesia and of 0.06 mg flunitrazepam per kg without basal anaesthesia were examined in respect to mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and the efferent action potentials of the N. sympathicus and the N. phrenicus. In all experiments, a mild and short-term reduction in blood pressure, a slight tachycardia and a very brief inhibition of the sympathetic nerve were observed. Definite actions exercised by flunitrazepam consisted of an inhibition of the respiratory centre which was due to a reduction of the extent and intensity of the inspiratory discharges of the phrenic nerve, although the breathing rate was increased. A comparison of the tests with flunitrazepam alone and in combination with N2O yielded definite differences only in the case of the asphyxia tests. The combination produced a significant inhibition of the vagus centre which was absent when flunitrazepam was used alone.", 
    "41": "A 1,4-benzodiazepine, SC-32855, was administered orally once daily at doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg for two weeks to adult Beagle dogs (1/sex/dose). The 300 mg/kg animals were sacrificed in extremis on day three after showing extreme signs of CNS depression. At necropsy, the testes of the 100 mg/kg male weighed considerably less than those of the control. The testicular weights of the 30 and 300 mg/kg animals were comparable to the weight of the control testes. Histopathologic evaluation of the testes of the 100 mg/kg male revealed degenerative and necrotic changes in the seminiferous tubules and cytoplasmic vacuolation in Leydig cells. In the 30 and 300 mg/kg animals, degenerative and necrotic changes were restricted to the seminiferous tubules.", 
    "42": "Tofizopam, a 3,4-benzodiazepine, lacks the sedative action common to 1,4-benzodiazepines, but has anxiolytic activity. In this study we administered tofizopam (50 mg/kg) to rats perorally twice a day for six days, and analyzed the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptors of these drug-treated rats. The effect of tofizopam treatment was compared to that brought about by treatment with diazepam (12 mg/kg twice a day for six days) and to binding in controls treated with vehicle. Compared to the controls, the diazepam group had a marked decrease in binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptors both in the forebrain and in the hindbrain. As a result of the increased affinity of the receptors tofizopam slightly, but statistically significantly, enhanced binding. With both drugs the number of receptors was unaltered. The effect of tofizopam in the hindbrain was similar to that in the forebrain. The results of this study support our earlier finding from single-dose studies that tofizopam acts indirectly on benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "43": "In addressing the role that the substrate of brain stimulation reward might play in drug abuse, Wise [47] reviewed evidence relating brain stimulation and psychomotor stimulant reward to dopaminergic but not noradrenergic elements identified with brain reward circuitry. He then speculated that one possible mechanism of opiate, ethanol, barbiturate or benzodiazepine reward might involve a specified disinhibition of the dopaminergic element. He suggested that these drugs might have inhibitory actions on locus coeruleus, which in turn might send an inhibitory projection to the dopaminergic link in reward circuitry. This speculation is challenged with respect to ethanol in the companion article [1] and with respect to opiates in the present article. Recent evidence indicates that the rewarding action of opiates is mediated in the region of the dopaminergic cells of the ventral tegmentum and not in the region of the noradrenergic cells of locus coeruleus. Rewarding opiate injections appear to activate the same or a similar dopaminergic link in brain reward circuitry as that thought to be activated through its afferent inputs in the case of brain stimulation reward and activated at its synaptic terminals in the case of psychomotor stimulant reward. Whether other drugs of abuse activate links in brain reward circuitry which function in parallel or in series with the dopaminergic link identified with opiates and stimulants remains an open question.", 
    "44": "Long-term administration of cimetidine, a histamine2 receptor antagonist, has been reported to normalize elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations in patients with secondary [1] and primary hyperparathyroidism [2] and even to improve the clinical symptoms. We have compared the effect of cimetidine and pirenzepine on PTH and calcitonin (CT) plasma levels in a short-term trial on patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. After cimetidine a significant effect on PTH was seen within 30 min lasting 30 min and after pirenzepine, within 60 min and lasting 60 min. The effect on CT was only significant after cimetidine.", 
    "45": "The pharmacological activity of four new groups of isoquino [2,1-d] ((1,4]benzodiazepines, i.e. the 6-oxo-12,13-dimethoxy-5H-7H--9,10-dihydroisoquino [2,1-d] [1,4]benzodiazepinium bromides (I); 5,9,10,14b--tetrahydroisoquino [2,1-d] [1,4]benzodiazepin-7H-6-ones (II); 6-phenyl-12,13--dimethoxy-7,9,10,14b-tetrahydroisoquino [2,1-d] [1,4]benzodiazepines (III) and 6-phenyl-12,13-dimethoxy-7H-9,10-dihydroisoquino [2,1-d] [1,4]benzodiazepinium bromides (IV) was studied. All the compounds studied are biologically active. They show a depressive effect on the central nervous system, which is most pronounced in (II). It was established that the presence of alkyl substituents in the position-7 of the structure (II) as well as the chlorine atom in position-2 resulted in an increase of activity. Most of these compounds possess a mild or strong antinociceptive effect. Some of them exhibited an antireserpine activity as well. The spasmolytic effect of (IV) was strong while the rest of the compounds exerted a very weak spasmolytic effect. All the compounds tested on the autonomous nervous system possess the characteristics of weak sympathomimetics.", 
    "46": "The therapeutic effect of 6 benzodiazepine tranquilizers (diazepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide, phenazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam) was compared to the activity displayed in the most widely used experimental models. The methods of conflict situation, antagonism with thiosemicarbazide and corasole were found to be highly significant for predicting the clinical efficacy of benzodiazepines. The conditioned reflex techniques were shown untenable for estimating the therapeutic action of the tranquilizers. The correlation was discovered between integral clinical tranquilizing effects of benzodiazepines, their experimental activity and affinity to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "47": "Ethanol and benzodiazepines interact both pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically. However, the importance of these effects has been exaggerated. Kinetically, acute doses of ethanol impair the disposition of benzodiazepines that are metabolized by demethylation or hydroxylation, but not those that undergo glucuronide conjugation. On the other hand, chronic ethanol administration increases the clearance of benzodiazepines that are demethylated or hydroxylated. The pharmacodynamics of the ethanol-benzodiazepine combination is less clear. The sedative and psychomotor effects of the combination appear to be enhanced, compared to the effects of the drugs given alone. However, it is difficult to assess the proportion of the observed effects that is due to benzodiazepines, as ethanol appears to be the dominant partner in this combination. Studies attempting to control for this imbalance have been so hampered by methodological problems that no firm conclusions can be drawn. Moreover, a number of benzodiazepines have not been studied in combination with ethanol. We suggest, however, that the ethanol-benzodiazepine interaction is probably less important than those involving ethanol and other psychotropic drugs, such as cannabinoids, neuroleptics, stimulants, and antidepressants.", 
    "48": "The pharmacokinetics of lorazepam after 0.03 mg/kg intravenous administration was investigated in 14 surgical patients (nasal surgery under local anaesthesia) ranging in age from 25 to 86 years (8 males and 6 females). No statistically significant changes in the kinetics of lorazepam associated with the aging process were found. In these premedicated patients a slow onset of the drug action of lorazepam was assessed both subjectively and objectively with no apparent relationship to the age. These findings are of potential clinical importance, because it is highly desirable to use drugs for which age-related alterations are of minimum degree. In 5 male patients undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, lorazepam disappeared from the plasma after a single 4 mg intravenous injection with an apparent comparable half-life (10.0 +/- 3.2 min.) to that of the above mentioned surgical patients. The concentrations of both unconjugated and conjugated lorazepam dropped abruptly at the start of extracorporeal circulation followed by an increase in the postperfusion period. After this peak effect the mean apparent half-life of lorazepam was 15.5 +/- 5.8 hours of indicating no great change in its elimination in comparison with patients operated under local anaesthesia (half-life 12.1 +/- 3.7 hours). Pharmacokinetically, lorazepam appears to be a useful agent in connection with cardiopulmonary bypass operation.", 
    "49": "1 The effect of intravenous cimetidine 200 mg or 400 mg on the absorption of lorazepam 2.5 mg tablet and diazepam 10 mg tablet and capsule was studied. 2 Considerable individual variation in plasma concentrations was found with all preparations. 3 Cimetidine increased the absorption of diazepam and lorazepam. 4 Capsule preparations of diazepam generally produced higher drug plasma concentrations than the tablets.", 
    "50": "Psychomotor and psychologic effects of single doses of buspirone (10 and 20 mg) and lorazepam (2.5 mg) alone or combined with alcohol (1 gm/kg) were investigated in 12 healthy young men (crossover study). Lorazepam alone impaired psychomotor skills (tracking, body balance, extraocular muscle balance, and flicker recognition), the effects being maximal at 180 min. This impairment was not subjectively perceived by the subjects. Neither dose of buspirone alone impaired objective measurements, although buspirone, especially in the 20-mg dose, was felt to cause drowsiness, weakness, and faintness. Lorazepam, but not buspirone, interacted with alcohol.", 
    "51": "Groups of rats were pretreated for 5 days with chlordiazepoxide (5 to 50 mg/kg) or with control water injections. On the sixth day the rats were given a test dose of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), or water. The rats that had received 5 days of pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide were significantly less sedated by the test dose than were those given chlordiazepoxide for the first time, i.e. they had developed tolerance. There were no significant differences between the two pretreatment groups in the extent of tolerance. A second experiment examined the effects of associating drug injections with apparatus cues. This had no effect on the development of tolerance, but had a significant effect on its retention: rats pretreated and replaced in their home cages showed complete recovery from tolerance after two drug-free days, whereas those placed in the apparatus after each day's injection retained some tolerance even after two drug-free weeks.", 
    "52": "Rats trained to discriminate pentylenetetrazol from saline had this cue antagonized by the benzodiazepine, clorazepate. Ro 15-1788 reversed the antagonism of the pentylenetetrazol cue produced by clorazepate. Similarly, Ro 15-1788 blocked the anti-conflict effect of clorazepate. Rats trained to discriminate clorazepate from saline, however, generalized this cue to Ro 15-1788. These results demonstrate that Ro 15-1788 is not a pure benzodiazepine antagonist, but has partial agonist properties.", 
    "53": "Picrotoxin, isopropylbicyclophosphate (IPTBO) and related CNS-convulsants have allosteric effects on the binding of ligands to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. When binding experiments were performed at 23 degrees C and at 35 degrees C, these drugs inhibited [3H]muscimol binding and muscimol- or GABA-stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding, respectively. Both effects required the presence of C1-, Br-, I- but not of F- or SO4(2-). Picrotoxin and IPTBO could only partially inhibit [3H]muscimol binding. In contrast other GABA antagonists and convulsants like bicuculline, 3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5 beta-17-aza-androstan-11-one (R 5135), strychnine and d-tubocurarine interferred completely with [3H]muscimol binding, also in the absence of those ions mentioned above which were essential for the effects of picrotoxin. Our results support the notion that drugs like picrotoxin and IPTBO which interfere with the GABA receptor effector system, may lead to an allosteric perturbation of GABA-recognition sites.", 
    "54": "The administration of kainic acid (1--2 micrograms) into the right striatum of adult rats resulted in a marked local increase in tryptophan hydroxylase activity (+ 54--106%). This change was significant as soon as on the second day after the treatment and persisted for at least 12 days. In addition, long-lasting elevations of tryptophan hydroxylase activity were also observed in the anterior raphe area, septum and ipsilateral hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In contrast, the intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid (1 microgram) induced a long-term increase in tryptophan hydroxylase activity only in the injected structure. In all cases, the changes in tryptophan hydroxylase activity were associated with significant increases in the Vmax of the enzyme with no alteration of its apparent affinities for tryptophan and the pterin cofactor. Studies of the sensitivity of tryptophan hydroxylase from control and from kainic acid-treated rats to in vitro activating conditions (Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation, partial trypsinization, exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate) suggest that the intrastriatal injection of the neurotoxin induced a long-lasting activation of the enzyme. These findings indicate that intracerebral injections of kainic acid may be a valuable approach to explore further the mechanisms controlling tryptophan hydroxylase activity in vivo.", 
    "55": "The levels of compliance with psychotropic medication in three New Zealand community-based samples are reported. At younger ages psychotropics were not frequently used, only 2 percent of 15 to 34 year olds reporting use during a 24 hour period. Psychotropic drug use was most prevalent among elderly people. However, a substantial proportion, about half, of those prescribed for took lower or less frequent doses than directed.", 
    "56": "Binding to several receptors was compared in brain regions of 3 and 21-23 month-old rats. In crude membrane preparations of aged rats the number of dopamine antagonist receptors in striatum was much reduced (-53%). beta-Noradrenergic receptors (cortex) and benzodiazepine receptors (hippocampus and cerebellum) were less but significantly reduced and serotonergic receptors, alpha 1 noradrenergic receptors (both in cortex) and dopamine agonist receptors (striatum) were unchanged. For each receptor binding the KD values were the same in young and old animals. GABA receptor binding (hippocampus and cerebellum) evaluated at only one 3H-GABA concentration (8 nM) was similar in both groups when expressed per protein content but significantly reduced in aged rats when expressed per tissue wet weight because of the partial purification of the synaptic membranes used for 3H-GABA binding. In our experimental conditions age-related changes of specific binding sites in the central nervous system were selective for some receptors studied and did not seem to be due to general non-specific modification of brain tissue composition.", 
    "57": "The influence of personality traits on the reaction of patients to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was studied prospectively in 86 patients. High N (neuroticism) scores on the Eysenck personality inventory were associated with poor tolerance to and future compliance with the procedure. Although premedication with diazepam did not affect the degree of discomfort and distress during the procedure, it guaranteed acceptance of repeat endoscopy by virtue of its strong amnesic effect. By contrast, not giving premedication to patients who were anxious and had high N scores jeopardized future compliance. These findings suggest that a version of the Eysenck personality inventory should be used to assess patients' neurotic phenotype and their need for premedication before endoscopy. Alternatively, all patients might be given premedication.", 
    "58": "Beta-blockers are increasingly often used with suicidal intent, but are also sometimes swallowed accidentally by small children. Beta-blockers available in the Federal Republic of Germany differ in their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. After analysing 49 cases of intoxication, no certain relationship was found between the different substances and specific symptoms. Cardiovascular signs such as sinus bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension (30 cases), as well as dizziness and drowziness (17) were the most frequent ones. Loss of consciousness and hallucination (13), as well as seizures (3), also occurred frequently. Hypoglycaemia or symptoms due to it (12) were noted especially in young children. In addition to primary removal of the drug, repeated administration of charcoal and sodium sulphate are recommended with most of the drugs for interrupting the enterohepatic circulation. Administration of atropine for bradycardia and hypotension was usually not effective. Dopamine is recommended; glucagon for definite signs of shock. Haemodialysis is indicated only in exceptional instances and is effective for only a few of the drugs. Forced diuresis should not be practised.", 
    "59": "The irreversible labeling by [3H]flunitrazepam of three proteins with apparent molecular weights of 51,000 (P51), 55,000 (P55) and 59,000 (P59) was investigated using hippocampal membranes isolated from rats at various timepoints after birth. The present results indicate that [3H]flunitrazepam predominantly labels P55 and P59 in the early days after birth whereas labeling of P51 starts to increase significantly in the second postnatal week. A possible association of P55 and P59 with type 2 and of P51 with type 1 benzodiazepine receptors is suggested.", 
    "60": "When membranes of rat cerebellum are exposed to UV light in the presence of flunitrazepam this ligand can be incorporated into one of the assumed 4 benzodiazepine binding sites of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. This irreversible incorporation of flunitrazepam, in contrast to reversible binding of this substance, leads to conformational changes of the remaining 3 benzodiazepine binding sites which result in a decreased affinity of benzodiazepine agonists, but not of benzodiazepine antagonists. The investigation of the affinity of drugs for [3H]benzodiazepine antagonist binding before and after photoaffinity labelling of benzodiazepine receptors with flunitrazepam can therefore be used as a sensitive and simple test to distinguish between agonists and antagonists in vitro.", 
    "61": "We have compared fifteen synthetic purines and purine nucleosides on their ability to displace [3H]diazepam binding to rat brain membranes. Among these analogs, 6-methylthioguanine was found to be most potent, inhibiting competitively the specific binding of [3H]diazepam with a Ki value of 16 micro M. At a concentration of 50 micro M, 6-methyl-thioguanine increased tha apparent Kd of specific diazepam binding from 4.3 nM to 13.3 nM without affecting the Bmax, nor had it any effect on the non-specific binding. Binding with membrane preparations from developing rat brain was slightly less sensitive to 6-methylthioguanine inhibition than that with membranes prepared from mature brain.", 
    "62": "Cats were treated once daily for 35 days with flurazepam (FZP). Different groups received 2, 5 or 20 mg/kg per day. A fourth group was started at 20 mg/kg per day, then the dose was increased to 30, and finally 40 mg/kg per day. Muscle relaxation, ataxia, and other measures of neurological impairment were used to measure drug actions. Tolerance developed rapidly, and no FZP effects were seen after 2-3 weeks of treatment with 2 or 5 mg/kg. Doses of 2-100 mg/kg FZP were injected i.p., 48 h after the last dose of chronic treatment with 2 or 5 mg/kg, and peak FZP effects were recorded. There was an approximate 10-fold shift to the right of the dose-response curve, indicating a large degree of functional tolerance after 5 weeks of FZP treatment. The pattern of tolerance, as measured by dose-response analysis, suggests that it may be different from the functional tolerance developed during barbiturate administration.", 
    "63": "Des-tyrosine-gamma-endorphin (beta-endorphin-(2-17); DTgamma E) lacks direct in vitro activity at dopaminergic receptors, but does inhibit in vivo [3H]spiperone binding in various rat brain areas. The principal objective of these studies was to test the hypothesis that DTgammaE may exert its selective, neuroleptic-like activity through an active metabolite. Accordingly, DTgammaE was incubated at 37 degrees C in a whole rat brain homogenate of neutral pH after which samples were prepared for HPLC analysis. The major, heat-stable metabolite of DTgammaE was identified as the clinically active, beta-endorphin related fragment, beta-endorphine-(6-17). The beta-endorphin sequences 4-17, 5-17, l0-17, 12-17 and 2-16 were also present but in minor amounts. Identical results were obtained studying DTgammaE metabolism using rat striatal tissue slices. Neurotransmitter receptor binding experiments showed that beta-endorphin-(6-17) was inactive at central dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, benzodiazepine and opiate receptors measured in vitro. Thus, like DTgammaE, beta-endorphin-(6-17) differs from classical neuroleptics in that it does not inhibit in vitro [3H]spiperone binding in the corpus striatum, frontal cortex or mesolimbic areas of the rat brain. It may be that DTgammaE and beta-endorphine-(66-17) exert their selective neuroleptic-like activity through an indirect inhibition of central dopaminergic activity, possibly in combination with an in vivo antagonism of the postsynaptic dopamine receptor.", 
    "64": "The cyclical exacerbations of epilepsy (catamenial epilepsy) were used to assess the antiepileptic effect of a benzodiazepine, clobazam. Doses of 20 mg, and in some cases 30 mg, per day were compared with placebo over predetermined ten-day periods in a double-blind cross-over study. The results were evaluated by preference in a sequential procedure. In 14 of 18 patients who received both treatments clobazam was superior to placebo, and in 4 patients no preference was established. Clobazam completely prevented seizures in most of the patients, and toxic effects were of low frequency and severity.", 
    "65": "A rapid method is described for the electron-capture gas chromatographic determination of clonazepam in plasma or serum using methyl-clonazepam as an internal standard. The analysis is performed isothermally on the silicone stationary phase SP-2510DA (Supelco). With this liquid phase, gas chromatographic properties are comparable to methods involving acid hydrolysis or derivatisation. A short pre-column containing another phase is added to enhance resolution. The method involves a single extraction, requires 100 microliter of sample and has a detection limit of 3 nmol/l. Response is linear at concentrations from 5--900 nmol/l and thus clonazepam analysis both during therapy and after overdosage is possible. Plasma and serum clonazepam levels are interchangeable.", 
    "66": "The effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the binding of PK 8165, a quinoline derivative, and CGS 8216, a pyrazoloquinoline, was assessed in two different regions of the rat brain. PK 8165, a compound with reported anxiolytic properties, inhibited [3H]-propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate labeled receptors in the cerebellum with an IC50 of 844 nM and 370 nM in the absence and presence of micro M GABA, respectively. GABA (100 micro M) was less effective in the cerebral cortex, decreasing the IC50 value from 280 to 197 nM. In saturation isotherm studies with [3H]-CGS 8216, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, GABA (100 micro M) induced a small but significant reduction in the apparent affinity of [3H]-CGS 8216 for benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex but the Bmax was unchanged."
