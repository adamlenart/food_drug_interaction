These myocytes demonstrated significant shortening on ACh exposure. To evaluate the mechanism by which these myocytes acquire responsiveness to ACh, we assessed receptor-Ca(2+) coupling using fura 2-AM fluorescence imaging and muscarinic receptor expression using Western analysis. Cells were grown to confluence in 10% fetal bovine serum and then maintained for 7-13 days in serum-free medium. A fraction of serum-deprived cells exhibited reproducible intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in response to ACh that was uniformly absent from airway myocytes before serum deprivation. The Ca(2+) response to 10(-4) M ACh was ablated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor blockade using 10(-6) M xestospongin C but not by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). Also, 10(-7) M atropine or 10(-7) M 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine completely blocked the response to ACh, but intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization was not ablated by 10(-6) M pirenzepine or 10(-6) M methoctramine. In contrast, 10(-5) M bradykinin (BK) was without effect in these ACh-responsive myocytes. Interestingly, myocytes that did not respond to ACh demonstrated robust increases in intracellular Ca(2+) on exposure to 10(-5) M BK that were blocked by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and were only modestly affected by IP(3) receptor blockade. Serum deprivation increased the abundance of M(3) receptor protein and of BK(2) receptor protein by two- to threefold in whole cell lysates within 2 days of serum deprivation, whereas M(2) receptor protein fell by >75%. An increase in M(3) receptor abundance and restoration of M(3) receptor-mediated Ca(2+) mobilization occur concomitant with reacquisition of a contractile phenotype during prolonged serum deprivation. These data demonstrate plasticity in muscarinic surface receptor expression and function in a subpopulation of airway myocytes that show mutually exclusive physiological and pharmacological diversity with other cells in the same culture.", 
    "1": "Different alpha subunits of human gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors were transiently expressed together with beta(3) and gamma(2) subunits in Xenopus oocytes to examine the interactions of various GABA(A) agonists and representative allosteric modulators. Chloride currents elicited by agonists were measured using two electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. Where compounds behaved as full agonists, i.e. GABA on all subtypes and 4,5,6, 7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) on alpha2beta(3)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors, agonist concentration-response curves were shifted to the left by the benzodiazepine full agonist chlordiazepoxide and the anticonvulsant loreclezole, or to the right by the inverse agonist 6, 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (DMCM), with no effect on the maximal currents (I(max)). In contrast, maximal responses for different partial GABA(A) agonists on all benzodiazepine-sensitive alpha(x)beta(3)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors were enhanced by chlordiazepoxide. I(max) values for piperidine-4-sulphonic acid (P4S) on alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2), THIP on alpha(3)beta(3)gamma(2), and 5-(4-piperidyl)isothiazol-3-ol (thio-4-PIOL) on alpha(2)beta(3)gamma(2) and alpha(5)beta(3)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors were increased by chlordiazepoxide, while that for P4S on alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors was decreased by DMCM. The I(max) values for partial agonists were also enhanced by pentobarbitone, the neurosteroid allopregnanolone and loreclezole irrespective of receptor subtype or the nature of the partial agonist. In the light of models of ligand-gated ion channel receptor activation we suggest two possible mechanisms of action for the effects of allosteric modulators on partial agonist receptor activation: either selective modulation of agonist affinity for the open/closed state, or direct modulation of the gating process itself.", 
    "2": "Electrophysiological techniques provide an objective and non-invasive measure of neurological function. In order to undertake detailed evoked potential studies in rats on repeated occasions, it is necessary to find an appropriate anaesthetic agent which has minimal and reproducible effects on the parameters to be studied and also has a minimal effect on the general welfare of the animals. In this study we compared the effects of four common anaesthetic agents (ketamine-xylazine, medetomidine, isoflurane and fentanyl/fluanisone-midazolam) on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in rats following electrical stimulation of the fore- and hind-paw. Fentanyl/fluanisone-midazolam was found to be well tolerated by the animals and to have, in general, the least deleterious effect on SEPs. For example, the response recorded at the level of the somatosensory cortex (P1), following forelimb stimulation, appeared on average 1.80 ms earlier with fentanyl/fluanisone-midazolam than with the other agents and the peak-to-peak amplitude (CI to CII) of the response recorded at the cervical (C3) level was on average 5.86 microV greater with fentanyl/fluanisone-midazolam. Fentanyl/fluanisone-midazolam is, therefore, recommended as the anaesthetic of choice for longitudinal studies of SEPs in the rat.", 
    "3": "Previous studies have found that the timely completion of an FR10 schedule of food-rewarded lever pressing in rats demonstrates state dependence in drug-to-saline state changes with benzodiazepines and NMDA antagonists, but not with ethanol. We report here that, using sweetened condensed milk rather than food pellets as a reward, ethanol nonetheless produces a symmetrical state dependence with the lever press response requirement at doses that also impair acquisition. Extensive parametric studies are needed to unravel the apparently subtle conditions that govern the occurrence and features of the state dependence produced by various CNS compounds.", 
    "4": "Chronic administration of benzodiazepine (BZ) agonists in baboons typically increases food intake, in a dose-dependent manner, during drug administration and suppresses food intake after termination of drug dosing. To determine if suppressed food intake after termination of chronic BZ administration (i.e. withdrawal) was related to increased food consumption during drug administration, the effects of chronic triazolam (1.0 mg/kg/day, intragastrically, for 30-34 days) and subsequent triazolam withdrawal on food intake was studied under two conditions in each of four baboons: (1) when the number of pellets was unlimited; and (2) when the number of pellets was limited so that pellet intake could not increase above the mean number of pellets per day obtained during a preceding vehicle condition. Pellets were available during daily 20-h sessions under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of reinforcement. All baboons completed both pellet conditions, and the order of exposure was counterbalanced across subjects. During the unlimited pellet condition, pellets per day were increased during triazolam administration and then were suppressed in a time-limited manner when triazolam was discontinued in all four baboons. When pellet intake was limited during triazolam administration, pellet intake after triazolam discontinuation was suppressed in three of four baboons, and the magnitude and duration of suppression was generally less than during the unlimited pellet condition. Other behavioral signs of withdrawal (e.g., tremor/jerk, vomit/retch) were observed in all four baboons under both pellet conditions. These data suggest that the hyperphagic effects of triazolam appear to contribute to the subsequent suppression of food intake during triazolam withdrawal. However, these hyperphagic effects do not account for the entire phenomenon of suppressed food intake during BZ withdrawal.", 
    "5": "Studies of the discriminative stimulus effects of drug mixtures provide an approach to polydrug abuse and to studies on single drugs with multiple effects. The experiments described here investigated whether the use of the AND-OR procedure increases the specificity of drug mixture discriminations. Rats were trained to discriminate a mixture of nicotine (0.4 mg/ kg) plus midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) from saline (AND-discrimination, n = 10) or to discriminate the same mixture from its component drugs alone (AND-OR discrimination, n = 10). The studies used two-lever operant procedures with a tandem variable interval 1 min fixed ratio 10 (FR 10) schedule of food reinforcement. Under AND-discrimination conditions, there was partial generalization to amphetamine and pentobarbitone when each drug was administered singly. With the AND-OR-discrimination, there was no generalization to amphetamine and partial generalization to pentobarbitone. In 'single substitution' tests, pentobarbitone or amphetamine was co-administered with the training doses of nicotine and midazolam, respectively; there was full generalization in the AND-discrimination and no generalization under AND-OR conditions. In 'dual substitution' tests, mixtures of amphetamine plus pentobarbitone produced full generalization under AND-discrimination conditions, and partial generalization in the AND-OR procedure. Wherever comparisons were made, generalization was less under AND-OR- than under the AND-discrimination procedure, confirming that the AND-OR procedure can increase the specificity of discriminations based on drug mixtures. The similarity with findings reported previously for training with mixtures of amphetamine plus pentobarbitone suggests that this may reflect a general principle rather than a phenomenon restricted to particular training drugs.", 
    "6": "The present study characterized the discriminative-stimulus effects of triazolam and midazolam in rhesus monkeys. Six monkeys discriminated 0.1 mg/kg of triazolam from vehicle under a fixed-ratio 5 (FR 5) schedule of stimulus-shock termination (SST). Four monkeys subsequently discriminated 0.56 mg/kg of midazolam from vehicle under the same schedule of reinforcement. Benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonists midazolam and diazepam, and the barbiturate pentobarbital, substituted for triazolam, and the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine did not. Triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, flunitrazepam, as well as the barbiturates amobarbital and pentobarbital, substituted for midazolam, and ketamine did not. The BDZ antagonist flumazenil antagonized both the triazolam and midazolam discriminative stimuli. Bretazenil, a low-efficacy BDZ agonist, did not substitute for the midazolam discriminative stimulus in three of the monkeys and shifted the midazolam dose-effect curve to the right; in a fourth monkey, bretazenil substituted for midazolam and shifted the midazolam dose-effect curve to the left. Schild analyses with flumazenil or bretazenil, in combination with midazolam, yielded slopes that deviated significantly from unity. While clearly supporting the notion that BDZ agonists produce stimulus effects by acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) receptor complex, these data also suggest that the discriminative-stimulus effects of midazolam might be mediated by more than one BDZ receptor subtype.", 
    "7": "The experiments in this study compared the pharmacological properties of several BZ-omega receptor ligands, including the imidazobenzodiazepine imidazenil, the beta-carboline abecarnil, the pyridazinone Y-23684, the pyrido [1,2-a]benzimidazole RWJ 46771 and the 1,6-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one derivative SX-3228, with the prototypical BZs diazepam, clobazam and bretazenil. In in vitro experiments diazepam, bretazenil, imidazenil and Y-23684 displaced [3H]flumazenil binding non-selectively in membranes from rat cerebellum and spinal cord, two brain areas enriched in the BZ-omega 1 and BZ-omega 2 receptor subtypes, respectively. In contrast, abecarnil, RWJ 46771 and SX-3228 were more potent in displacing [3H]flumazenil binding to membranes from rat cerebellum than from spinal cord or hippocampus, indicating selectivity for the BZ-omega 1 receptor subtype. The in vivo experiments showed that all compounds increased the latency to clonic seizures produced by isoniazid. However, the maximal increase in latency induced by diazepam, clobazam, abecarnil, RWJ 46771 and SX-3228 was greater than that of bretazenil, imidazenil and Y-23684, thereby indicating that these latter compounds have low intrinsic efficacy. In the punished drinking, the punished lever pressing and the elevated plus-maze tests in rats, three models of anxiety, diazepam, clobazam and imidazenil elicited clear anxiolytic-like effects but at doses which were close to those producing hypolocomotion, ataxia and myorelaxation as measured in activity cages, the rotarod and the loaded grid tests, respectively. In contrast, bretazenil and Y-23684 induced anxiolytic-like activity at much lower doses than those which impaired motor performances. The magnitude of the positive effects of Y-23684 was similar to that of the reference BZs, suggesting that it may become a valuable alternative to currently used agents for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Abecarnil, RWJ 46771 and SX-3228 produced weaker or non-specific anxiolytic-like effects as they decreased anxiety-related behaviours at doses similar or close to those impairing motor performance. However, unlike the other compounds they induced myorelaxation at doses which were 3-10 times higher than those needed to produce decrease in exploratory activity. It is suggested that the behavioural profiles of abecarnil, RWJ 46771 and SX-3228 may be attributed to their selectivity for the BZ-omega 1 receptor subtype which may account for their sedative activity, thereby masking other effects including anxiolytic-like activity. This suggests that BZ receptor modulation of anxiety may involve BZ receptor subtypes other than BZ-omega 1.", 
    "8": "This study evaluated the relationship between sedative-like subjective responses to ethanol and triazolam in normal, healthy volunteers. It was hypothesized that subjects' responses to the two drugs would be correlated, because of the common mechanism of action of the drugs at the GABAA receptor complex. Twenty-seven volunteers (14 male, 13 female), aged 21-35 years, received beverages or capsules containing ethanol (0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 g/kg), triazolam (0.125, 0.25 or 0.5 mg) or placebo (two sessions) on eight separate sessions in a random order. Various self-reported and objective drug effects were measured, including measures of sedative-like subjective effects, as indexed by the ARCI PCAG scale. PCAG scores of individual subjects across the three active doses of each drug were fitted with a straight line function (y = a + bx), and the correlation of the slopes from the fitted curves for ethanol and triazolam was examined. Among the participants who reported any sedative-like responses to ethanol, the sedative-like effects of ethanol and triazolam were positively correlated. That is, subjects who exhibited the steepest dose-related effects on measures of subjective sedation after ethanol also exhibited the steepest slopes after triazolam. These findings provide partial support for the idea that ethanol and triazolam produce their sedative-like effects through the same mechanism.",

    "13": "Effects of the novel anxiolytic drug deramciclane on excitatory amino acid release and transmembrane Ca(2+) ion flux processes were compared in rat cerebrocortical homogenates containing resealed plasmalemma fragments and nerve endings. Deramciclane (10 microM) significantly inhibited [(3)H]D-aspartate release and transmembrane Ca(2+) flux to N-methyl-D-aspartate in the absence of Mg(2+). By contrast, inhibition of [(3)H]D-aspartate release and transmembrane Ca(2+) flux evoked by 0.1 mM (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate in the presence of Mg(2+) and 10 microM cyclothiazide by 10 microM deramciclane was not significant. In the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, deramciclane (10 microM) did not inhibit [(3)H]D-aspartate release to N-methyl-D-aspartate. These results suggest an involvement of the inhibition of a presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the anxiolytic properties of deramciclane.", 
    "14": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid(A) receptor gamma-subunits are important for benzodiazepine (BZD) binding and modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated Cl(-) current. Previously, by using gamma2/alpha1 chimeric subunits, we identified two domains of the gamma2-subunit, Lys-41-Trp-82 and Arg-114-Asp-161, that are, in conjunction, necessary and sufficient for high-affinity BZD binding. In this study, we generated additional gamma2/alpha1 chimeric subunits and gamma2 point mutants to identify specific residues within the gamma2 Lys-41-Trp-82 region that contribute to BZD binding. Mutant gamma2 and gamma2/alpha1 chimeric subunits were expressed with wild-type alpha1 and beta2 subunits in HEK 293 cells, and the binding of several BZDs was measured. We present evidence that the gamma2 region Met-57-Ile-62 is important for flunitrazepam binding and that, in particular, gamma2 Met-57 and gamma2 Tyr-58 are essential determinants for conferring high-affinity binding. Furthermore, we identify an additional residue, gamma2 Ala-79, that not only is important for high-affinity binding by flunitrazepam (a strong positive modulator) but also plays a crucial role in the binding of the imidazobenzodiazepines Ro15-1788 (a zero modulator) and Ro15-4513 (a weak negative modulator) in the BZD binding pocket. Results from site-directed mutagenesis of gamma2 Ala-79 suggest that this residue may be part of a microdomain within the BZD binding site that is important for binding imidazobenzodiazepines. This separation of drug-specific microdomains for competitive BZD ligands lends insight into the structural determinants governing the divergent effects of these compounds.", 
    "15": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed for a variety of conditions, particularly anxiety and insomnia. They are relatively safe and, with overdose, rarely result in death. However, used chronically, benzodiazepines can be addicting. These agents are often taken in combination with other drugs of abuse by patients with addiction disorders. In such patients, alternatives to benzodiazepines may be preferable and may include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, buspirone, antihypertensive agents and the newer neuroleptic medications. Caution must be used when prescribing benzodiazepines to patients with a current or remote history of substance abuse.",

    "19": "According to the literature the syndrome is characterized by autonomous hyperactivity, resulting in tachycardia, tachypnoea, hypertension, perspiration, fever, tremors en fear. In delirium caused by alcohol withdrawal benzodiazepines are advised, sometimes in combination with haloperidol. ICUs sometimes use ethanol, although the effectiveness in preventing or treating withdrawal symptoms has never been ascertained in scientific investigations: in a meta-analysis the conclusion is drawn that the studies are too small and insufficiently objective to determine the effectiveness. The response to the questionnaire was 55% (96/176). From all ICUs, 15 (16%) used ethanol occasionally, and treated an estimated 17% of the admitted alcohol-dependent patients. There was a tendency for large ICUs to use ethanol in these patients more frequently. Each ICU used its own method to calculate the required ethanol dosage. Calculation on the basis of these dosages indicated a plasma ethanol concentration of at most 0.5 promille.",

This illness has been demonstrated to be the most common anxiety disorder with a 1-year prevalence of 7 to 8% and a lifetime prevalence of 13 to 14% in patients aged between 15 and 54 years. Social anxiety disorder can be classified into 2 subtypes, discrete and generalised. Morbidity is high with this disorder, and 70 to 80% of patients have co-morbid mental disorders. Although effective treatments are available, social anxiety disorder is under-recognised and under-treated. Treatments that have been systemically studied and have shown efficacy in patients with social anxiety disorder include pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reversible inhibitors of monoamine-A and benzodiazepines) and short term psychotherapies (cognitive behaviour therapy, social skills training and exposure in vivo therapy). Beta-blockers are useful in treating performance-related anxiety. Few published data are available on the treatment of social anxiety disorder with a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. We conclude this review by discussing proposed algorithms for treating both subtypes of social anxiety disorder.", 
    "22": "Spasticity is a common and disabling symptom for many patients with upper motor neuron dysfunction. It results from interruption of inhibitory descending spinal motor pathways, and although the pathophysiology of spasticity is poorly understood, the final common pathway is overactivity of the alpha motor neuron. Therapy for spasticity is symptomatic with the aim of increasing functional capacity and relieving discomfort. Any approach to treatment should be multidisciplinary, including physical therapy, and possibly surgery, as well as pharmacotherapy. It is important that treatment be tailored to the individual patient, and that both patient and care giver have realistic expectations. Pharmacotherapy is generally initiated at low dosages and then gradually increased in an attempt to avoid adverse effects. Optimal therapy is the lowest effective dosage. Baclofen, diazepam, tizanidine and dantrolene are currently approved for use in patients with spasticity. In addition, clonidine (usually as combination therapy), gabapentin and botulinum toxin have shown efficacy, however, more studies are required to confirm their place in therapy. Intrathecal baclofen, via a surgically implanted pump and reservoir, may provide relief in patients with refractory severe spasticity.", 
    "23": "In this study, we have developed a combined animal motion activity measurement system that combines an infrared light matrix subsystem with an ultrasonic phase shift subsystem for animal activity measurement. Accordingly, in conjunction with an IBM PC/AT compatible personal computer, the combined system has the advantages of both infrared and ultrasonic subsystems. That is, it can at once measure and directly analyze detailed changes in animal activity ranging from locomotion to tremor. The main advantages of this combined system are that it features real time data acquisition with the option of animated real time or recorded display/playback of the animal's motion. Additionally, under the multi-task operating condition of IBM PC, it can acquire and process behavior using both IR and ultrasound systems simultaneously. Traditional systems have had to make separate runs for gross and fine movement recording. This combined system can be profitably employed for normative behavioral activity studies and for neurological and pharmacological research.", 
    "24": "Wistar male rats pretreated with anti-stress agents like, Panax ginseng (Pg) and diazepam (Diaz) were stressed by restraining for 1 h and 5-HT content of brain and hypothalamus as well as plasma corticosterone were measured spectrophotoflurometrically. Diclofenac (DICLO), a prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibitor was used to confirm the role of prostaglandin in restraint stress-induced elevation of central 5-HT correspondingly confirmed by elevation of plasma corticosterone and modification of the above anti-stress agents. Pg, Diaz and DICLO per se did not modify brain and hypothalamic 5-HT in control rats. But they attenuated stress-induced elevation of brain and hypothalamic 5-HT. Anti-stress action of both Pg and Diaz reflected by inhibition of stress-induced elevation of brain and hypothalamic content of 5-HT as also stress-induced concurrent elevation of plasma corticosterone were further diminished by DICLO. The mediatory action of 5-HT in anti-stress effects of Pg and Diaz may be modulated through prostaglandins.", 
    "25": "The effect of L-arginine (840 mg/kg) pre- (30 min before challenge) and post-treatment (5 min after challenge) period was tested on picrotoxin-induced increase in ammonia concentrations in brain regions (cerebral cortex, brain stem and cerebellum) and the accompanying convulsive responses in adult male rats. The combined effect of L-arginine and diazepam was also tested against picrotoxin-induced convulsions. Picrotoxin-induced increase in ammonia was reverted partially by L-arginine pretreatment. However, L-arginine pretreatment did not show anticonvulsant effect independently or concurrently with diazepam. On the other hand, L-arginine post-treatment reverted ammonia to control level in all brain regions. A partial but significant inhibition of convulsion responses was found in these animals. The combined effect of diazepam and L-arginine post-treatment was much greater than that produced by these agents independently. These findings suggest that ammonia has a partial but significant participation in the convulsant action of picrotoxin. L-arginine has a potential to revert brain ammonia to control level in picrotoxin-treated animals and thereby it has produced a partial protection. The data further indicate that the duration of action of L-arginine is considerably short and has an additive anticonvulsant action with diazepam.", 
    "26": "To elucidate the utility of benzodiazepine receptor imaging for the detection of viable cortical neurons, dual-tracer autoradiography using iodine-125 iomazenil (IMZ) and iodine-123 N-isopropyl-4-iodoamphetamine (IMP) was performed in a model of reversible focal ischaemia during the acute and subacute phases. The right middle cerebral artery of anaesthetized rats was occluded for 60 min using an intraluminal filament and reperfused. In the acute phase study, 125I-IMZ (370 kBq) was injected via the femoral vein at 2 h after reperfusion, and 123I-IMP (37 MBq) was injected at 50 min post-injection. Rats were sacrificed 10 min after the injection of 123I-IMP. In the subacute phase study, the same procedure was performed at 5 days after reperfusion. In the acute phase, the IMP uptake was significantly decreased in almost all areas of the lesioned hemisphere, an exception being the cerebellum; however, the IMZ uptake was significantly decreased only in ischaemic cores. The discrepancy between IMZ and IMP uptake was observed in the lateral neocortex and the lateral caudate putamen (CPu), which were most frequently damaged in this ischaemic model. In the subacute phase, the IMZ uptake in lesioned rats was significantly decreased only in the parietal lobe and hippocampus, though the IMP uptake was decreased in many regions of lesioned hemispheres (the frontal, parietal cortex, CPu, hippocampus and thalamus). Histopathological findings indicated that both the IMP and the IMZ uptake was markedly decreased in necrotic areas. Although the IMP uptake was significantly decreased in the ischaemic areas, the IMZ uptake was maintained in these areas. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptor imaging is superior to regional cerebral blood flow imaging for the detection of viable cortical neurons in both the acute and subacute phases of ischaemia.", 
    "27": "A sensitive method using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for simultaneous determination of triazolam (TZ) and its hydroxy metabolites in hair has been developed. After the addition of deuterium-labeled 1 -hydroxymethyltriazolam (1-HT-d4) as an internal standard, analytes in hair shaft and hair root samples were extracted with a basic medium, CH2Cl2/MeOH/28% NH4OH (20:80:2), at room temperature overnight. The chromatographic separation of the analytes was achieved using a 3-microm micro HPLC column (100 x 2.0-mm i.d.) with a gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 1% acetic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.15 mL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in selected-ion monitoring mode at quasi molecular ions [M+H]+ of TZ and its metabolites. Under the proposed conditions, the ranges of quantitation of TZ, 1-HT, and 4-HT were 0.1-10 ng/0.2 mL. The method has been applied to determine the hair shaft and hair root incorporation of TZ and its metabolites into Dark Agouti rats administered with 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice a day for five days. Judging from the retention behavior by the chromatography and the mass spectra of the peaks detected, TZ, 1-HT, and 4-HT were incorporated in the hair shaft and the hair root. The concentration of 4-HT was the highest of all compounds detected. An unknown substance thought to be 1,4-diHT also appeared in both hair shaft and hair root samples. This substance was obtained from in vitro metabolic studies of TZ using rat liver microsome fraction and was accompanied by the other two metabolites, 1-HT and 4-HT. Structural elucidation was performed with online high-performance liquid chromatography-MS after acetylation of the substance with acetic anhydride and pyridine. This is the first report of the detection of the hydroxy metabolites of TZ in hair. The method has been found to be useful as a screening procedure of TZ intake in humans.",

We investigated the effects of analgesics on the increase in central cholinergic activity and writhing responses elicited by i.p. injection of acetic acid. ACh efflux from the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus was measured in the absence of a cholinesterase inhibitor using an in vivo microdialysis technique and a highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay. ACh efflux from the cerebral cortex was significantly increased during the first 30 min after acetic acid injection and then returned to the control levels. In contrast, acetic acid-induced writhing responses, indicative of the perception of pain, persisted for almost the entire 120 min observation period. No changes in ACh efflux were observed in the hippocampus. The centrally-acting analgesic morphine and the peripherally-acting analgesic indomethacin each completely abolished the enhanced cerebral cortical ACh efflux and the writhing, whereas diazepam, a muscle relaxant, selectively suppressed only the writhing. These results demonstrate that peripheral nociceptive stimulation transiently increases cholinergic activity in the cerebral cortex, but not in the hippocampus, and that analgesics suppress both the enhanced ACh efflux and the writhing induced by acetic acid.", 
    "36": "Eighteen healthy volunteers (10 men and 8 women) participated in a single-dose, double-blind, three-way crossover pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. Treatment conditions were 0.25 mg of triazolam, a full-agonist benzodiazepine ligand; 10 mg of zolpidem, an imidazopyridine having relative selectivity for the type 1 benzodiazepine receptor subtype; and placebo. Weight-normalized clearance of triazolam was higher in women than in men (8.7 versus 5. 5 ml/min/kg), but the difference was not significant. In contrast, zolpidem clearance was lower in women than in men (3.5 versus 6.7 ml/min/kg, P <.06). Compared to placebo, both active medications produced significant benzodiazepine agonist-like pharmacodynamic effects: sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, impaired information recall, and increased electroencephalographic beta-amplitude. Effects of triazolam and zolpidem in general were comparable and less than 8 h in duration. There was no evidence of a substantial or consistent sex difference in pharmacodynamic effects or in the kinetic-dynamic relationship, although subtle differences could not be ruled out due to low statistical power. The complete dependence of triazolam clearance on CYP3A activity, as opposed to the mixed CYP participation in zolpidem clearance, may explain the differing sex effects on clearance of the two compounds.",

    "42": "Neurotransmitters can have both toxic and trophic functions in addition to their role in neural signaling. Surprisingly, chronic blockade of GABA(A) receptor activity for 5-8 d in vitro enhanced survival of hippocampal neurons, suggesting that GABA(A) receptor overactivation may be neurotoxic. Potentiating GABA(A) receptor activity by chronic treatment with the endogenous neurosteroid (3alpha,5alpha)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one caused massive cell loss over 1 week in culture. Other potentiators of GABA(A) receptors, including benzodiazepines, mimicked the cell loss, suggesting that potentiating endogenous GABA activity is sufficient to produce neuronal death. Neurosteroid-treated neurons had lower resting intracellular calcium levels than control cells and produced smaller calcium rises in response to depolarizing challenges. Manipulating intracellular calcium levels with chronic elevated extracellular potassium or with the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 protected neurons. The results may have implications for the mechanisms of programmed cell death in the developing CNS as well as implications for the long-term consequences of chronic GABAmimetic drug use during development.",

Few studies have evaluated the characteristics that may lead to an acute withdrawal syndrome when these long-term medications are withdrawn. Those studies that have made recommendations for weaning rates to prevent withdrawal have given these recommendations with minimal data to support their recommendations. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the records of adult burn patients for the presence of acute BZD or OP withdrawal syndrome and to characterize whether patterns of BZD or OP administration or weaning rates contribute to the development of acute withdrawal syndrome. We found no relation of acute withdrawal syndrome to peak dose, total dose, or duration of dose of BZD/OP before the terminal withdrawal phase. There was a significant relationship between the rate of BZD/OP weaning in the terminal drug withdrawal phase and the percentage of days that patients experienced withdrawal symptoms (P < 0.005). Those patients who underwent a prolonged terminal weaning from these medications experienced fewer symptoms. The optimal rate of weaning that would allow decreased ventilator and intensive care unit length of stay without development of acute withdrawal symptoms is yet to be determined.",

Hallmark symptoms include an increase in the severity of sensations during rest and an irresistible urge to move the affected limbs. RLS often occurs concomitantly with periodic limb movement disorder. There are no known causes of RLS, but likely triggers include heredity, iron and vitamin deficiencies, caffeine, and alcohol. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease can worsen and prolong RLS symptoms. Symptom management begins by establishing proper nutrition intake and improved sleep hygiene. If these fail, conservative pharmacologic treatment is appropriate, with regimens chosen from dopaminergic agents, benzodiazepines, opioids, and anticonvulsants.", 
    "53": "The elevated plus-maze test was used to determine if the opiate antagonist naloxone could potentiate the anxiolytic-like effects of the benzodiazepine diazepam, the barbiturate pentobarbital, the propanediol carbamate meprobamate and the partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist [R]-1-[(10-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-4H-benzo[a]quinolizin-1-yl) carbonyl]-2-pyrrolidine-methanol (Ro19-8022) in the rat. A subeffective dose of each of these compounds was combined with naloxone, 10 mg/kg. Naloxone had no effect by itself, but potentiated all drugs except Ro19-8022. The proportion of entries on the open arm increased while the total number of arms entries was not modified. These results coincide with and extend data previously obtained in the mouse. One possible explanation for naloxone's effect could be that it blocks opioid inhibition of GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurons thereby enhancing the effects of benzodiazepines. Another possibility is that naloxone blocks opioid effects on adenosinergic systems.", 
    "54": "Abecarnil is a non-benzodiazepine that possesses anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties. Conflicting reports of tolerance and withdrawal signs following chronic abecarnil administration have emerged from animal studies using different species and different models of tolerance and dependence. This study used a radiotelemetric method to examine any emergence of tolerance and abstinence signs in the rat following long-term abecarnil administration. Hooded Wistar rats, n=6 per group, were administered either abecarnil (8 mg/kg/bidaily, i.p.) or vehicle for 24 days. Locomotor activity, body temperature and electromyographic (EMG) activity were measured daily immediately following abecarnil administration. Tolerance to the abecarnil-induced muscle relaxant effects and decreased locomotor activity developed within 21 days. Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (25 mg/kg), 18 h after abecarnil cessation, precipitated abstinence signs that included decreases in body temperature, and large increases in locomotor activity and muscle tone. Moreover, continuous recording of these measures over the 4 days after flumazenil administration indicated a prolonged increase in daytime locomotor activity, suggestive of spontaneous withdrawal. These data support earlier findings that reported signs of tolerance during administration of abecarnil and abstinence signs following abecarnil cessation.", 
    "55": "The basic symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia, i.e., a loss in cognitive function, are due to impaired nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission. To compensate for this impairment by drug treatment, blockers of the acetylcholine-degrading enzyme acetylcholinesterase are applied, even though this approach obviously is prone to many side-effects, including those of muscarinic nature. We have recently described a novel class of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands which, similar to the action of benzodiazepines on GABA(A) receptors, allosterically potentiate submaximal nicotinic responses. The sensitizing effect is a consequence of facilitated channel opening in the presence of allosterically potentiating ligand (APL). Representative members of this class of ligands are the plant alkaloids physostigmine, galanthamine, and codeine. Because APLs could enhance nicotinic neurotransmission under conditions of reduced secretion and/or increased degradation of acetylcholine or reduced acetylcholine-sensitivity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they could have a preventive and corrective action on impaired but still functioning nicotinic neurotransmission.", 
    "56": "The present study examined the effects of diazepam (a widely used anxiolytic benzodiazepine) on the behavioural response of pigs to three novel experimental situations used to measure anxiety-related behaviour in rodents. Twelve weaned pigs (two pairs from each of the three litters) were tested in an elevated plus-maze at the age of 6 weeks, a light/dark test at the age of 7 weeks and an open-field test at the age of 8 weeks. Six of the pigs were pre-treated with diazepam (valium) and the other six with saline (control). In the elevated plus-maze, diazepam-treated pigs had a higher number of entries into open arms (P=0.04), spent more time on open arms (P=0.07), and had a higher number of total arm entries (P=0.05) than pigs from the control group. However, diazepam had no significant effects on behaviour in the light/dark test (i.e., latency to enter lit compartment, number of entries into lit compartment and the time spent in lit compartment) or the open-field test (i.e., number of lines crossed, number of entries into centre). In summary, the anxiolytic effects of diazepam on the pigs' behaviour were only demonstrated in the elevated plus-maze, where the time spent on open arms and the number of entries into open arms could be interpreted as measures of anxiety in pigs.",

    "58": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is usually a self-limited disorder, with most cases resolving within 2 weeks after antipsychotic drug discontinuation. However, the course of NMS may not always be short-lived. In this report, the authors describe five patients who developed a residual catatonic state that persisted after acute hyperthermic symptoms of NMS had subsided and compare them with 27 similar cases in the literature. Two of our patients recovered gradually with supportive treatment. Three patients were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Of these, two showed a positive response, although one died later of intercurrent pneumonia. A third patient did not respond to ECT, but recovered gradually thereafter. Although dopamine agonists or benzodiazepines have been advocated for the treatment of residual symptoms in previous case reports, ECT was the treatment most often associated with a rapid response and no mortality, even in patients refractory to pharmacotherapy. In conclusion, catatonic and parkinsonian symptoms of NMS may persist as a residual state lasting for weeks to months after more fulminant acute symptoms abate. These residual symptoms may be more likely to develop in patients with pre-existing structural brain disorders. Although patients may improve gradually with supportive care or pharmacotherapy, ECT can often be highly effective in treating the residual catatonic state that follows NMS.", 
    "59": "Benzodiazepine use is a well-identified risk factor for falls and the resulting femur fractures in elderly adults. Benzodiazepines not requiring hepatic biotransformation may be safer than agents undergoing oxidation because oxidative activity has been shown to decline with age. The association between the use of either oxidative or nonoxidative benzodiazepines and the risk of femur fracture among elderly adults living in nursing homes was studied. A nested case-control study was conducted using the Systematic Assessment of Geriatric drug use via Epidemiology (SAGE) database; the records of 9,752 patients hospitalized for incident femur fracture during the period 1992 to 1996 were extracted, matching by age, gender, state, and index date to the records of 38,564 control patients. Conditional logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for femur fracture with adjustment for potential confounders. The adjusted OR for the overall use of benzodiazepines was 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.20); the risk seemed of only slightly greater magnitude for exposure to nonoxidative agents (1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36) than to oxidative benzodiazepines (1.08; 95% CI, 0.95-1.23). Among the latter, the effect was mainly accounted for by the use of agents with a long elimination half-life. A dose relationship was observed exclusively among users of long half-life oxidative benzodiazepines. The risk associated with the use of nonoxidative benzodiazepines showed no relationship to the age of the patients. In contrast, patients aged 85 years or older receiving oxidative benzodiazepines at high dosages or as needed had a two- to three-fold increased risk of femur fracture than did patients in the younger age group. Among older individuals, the use of benzodiazepines slightly increased the risk of femur fracture, mainly irrespective of the metabolic fate of the drug. Our results suggest that the use of nonoxidative benzodiazepines does not carry a lower risk for femur fracture than does the use of oxidative benzodiazepines. However, the latter agents may be associated with a somewhat higher risk of side effects among the oldest old, especially at higher dosages.", 
    "60": "This study examined the hypothesis that low doses of lorazepam modify emotional response. In accord with the results of prior studies that suggest a differential effect of benzodiazepines according to the subjects' anxiety level, the authors tested the effect of lorazepam (0.5 mg twice daily) on 2 groups of 32 subjects: those with high anxiety (HA) and those with low anxiety (LA). These groups were formed a priori on the basis of their scores on the Cattell Anxiety Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. The two groups were evaluated for psychomotor function and vigilance (visual analog scales [VAS], digit-symbol substitution test [DSST], and choice reaction time [CRT]), as well as emotional reactivity. Six emotions (fear, anger, disgust, sadness, joy, and neutral state) were induced by the presentation of six movie excerpts, and subjects' emotional responses were measured using the Differential Emotions Scale. The results suggest that at the doses studied, lorazepam led to an increase in negative emotions and a decrease in positive emotions, compared with placebo. This shift of emotional reactivity toward more negative emotions was slightly stronger with the HA than with the LA subjects. However, no reliable differences in the levels of performance and vigilance (CRT, DSST, and VAS) were observed as a function of either treatment or subject group. These findings suggest a possible relationship between benzodiazepine effects and subjects' anxiety level.", 
    "61": "Well-designed studies investigating how pediatric or adolescent patients with mental disorders respond to and metabolize the newer antipsychotic drugs are practically nonexistent. Without such data, clinicians have difficulty designing appropriate dosage regimens for patients in these age groups. The results from a study of olanzapine pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents are described. Eight inpatients (ages 10-18 years) with treatment-resistant childhood-onset schizophrenia received olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day) over 8 weeks. Blood samples, collected during dose titration and at a steady state provided pharmacokinetic data. The final evaluation (week 8) included extensive sampling for 36 hours after a 20-mg dose. Olanzapine concentrations in these eight pediatric patients were of the same magnitude as those for nonsmoking adult patients with schizophrenia but may be as much as twice the typical olanzapine concentrations in patients with schizophrenia who smoke. Olanzapine pharmacokinetic evaluation gave an apparent mean oral clearance of 9.6 +/- 2.4 L/hr and a mean elimination half-life of 37.2 +/- 5.1 hours in these young patients. The determination of the initial olanzapine dose for adolescent patients should take into consideration factors such as the patient's size. In general, however, the usual dose recommendation of 5 to 10 mg once daily with a target dose of 10 mg/day is likely a good clinical guideline for most adolescent patients on the basis of our pharmacokinetics results.", 
    "62": "In vitro data show the inhibition of alprazolam metabolism by sertraline via CYP3A4; therefore, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the authors conducted this study to assess the potential for similar in vivo inhibition in humans. Ten healthy volunteers participated in two test sessions (placebo/alprazolam 1 mg orally) before the initiation of sertraline treatment. Blood samples were obtained over a 32-hour period and pharmacodynamic measures (sedation, psychomotor performance, memory function) were obtained over an 8-hour period. After a minimum of 2 weeks of daily sertraline self-administration (50, 100, or 150 mg/day), test sessions were repeated. Alprazolam concentrations (N = 6, 4, and 6 at sertraline doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg/day, respectively) showed no significant changes based on peak concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2[beta]), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-8)), with the exception of a reduced Cmax in the 50 mg/day group. Similarly, dynamic data showed no significant variations based on peak effect, Tmax, and AUC(0-infinity), with the exception of increased peak impairment in one measure of psychomotor performance. No differences were detected between placebo alone and placebo plus sertraline. These findings suggest that sertraline (50-150 mg/day) does not alter the single-dose kinetics or dynamics of alprazolam; therefore, the combination may be prescribed without an increased risk of alprazolam toxicity.", 
    "63": "Swallowing is a complex mechanism based on the coordinated collaboration of tongue, pharynx and esophagus. Disturbances of this interplay or disorders of one or several of these components lead to dysphagia, non-cardiac chest pain or regurgitation. The major primary esophageal motility disorders--achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, hypercontractile esophagus ('nutcracker esophagus') and non-specific motility disorder--are of unknown etiology. Other esophageal diseases, such as cervical diverticula or gastroesophageal reflux disease, might also be caused by a primary esophageal motility disorder. Medical treatment of esophageal disorders with esophageal hyper- or dysmotility requires agents that reduce esophageal contractile force (anticholinergic agents, nitrates, calcium antagonists). Despite the beneficial effect of the various drugs on esophageal motility parameters, the clinical benefit of medical treatment of esophageal motility disorders is rather disappointing. Calcium channel antagonist, alone or in combination with anticholinergics or nitrates, can be used as a medical trial, especially in mild achalasia. However, medical therapy is clearly inferior to pneumatic balloon dilation therapy. Recently, botulinum toxin injection was suggested as a therapeutic option in achalasia patients with good results on lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and symptom scores that were similar to the results achieved by pneumatic balloon dilation. Hypercontractile esophagus shows a good manometric response to calcium channel antagonists, but only little clinical effect in terms of improvement of symptoms. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a relatively rare disease and few clinical studies are available. The use of calcium channel antagonists can be beneficial, at least in some patients with diffuse esophageal spasm. From clinical and epidemiological studies, there is some evidence of a 'psychological' component in the pathogenesis or perception of esophageal symptoms. There is some clinical benefit from centrally acting drugs such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants. With the exception of botulinum toxin for achalasia, medical therapy of primary esophageal motility disorders is rather limited and the clinical results are poor. Further understanding of esophageal pathophysiology as well as development of new receptor-selective drugs might increase our chances of a successful treatment of primary esophageal motility disorders.",

A specific ligand or PK 11195 was used to measure PBZr in the mitochondria (m-fraction) and the microsomal fraction (p-fraction). Density of binding sites and binding affinity (KD) was computed from Scatchard analysis. Binding in both m- and p-fractions from endometrium and endometrial carcinoma were saturable and of high affinity. The PBZr density in p-fraction from endometrium was slightly higher than in m-fraction, whereas the binding in m-fraction in endometrial carcinoma was more than 2-fold higher than in p-fraction. The difference between the densities in m-fraction from endometrial cancer and endometrium was highly significant (p < 0.005). There was no significant difference in the binding affinities (KD values) for PK 11195 in the various fractions. The selective increase in the density of PBZr in mitochondria of tumors suggests an association with energy demand and utilization and could be of diagnostic and/or therapeutic value in endometrial cancer.

    "82": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) belongs to main inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and activates three types of specific receptors--GABAA, GABAB i GABAC. At present, little is known about GABAC-mediated events. GABAB receptors are metabotropic, whilst stimulation of ionotropic GABAA receptors results in opening the chloride channel, followed by influx of chloride ions and hyperpolarization. The GABAA receptor possesses also binding sites for benzodiazepines and barbiturates which, via these sites, enhance GABAA-mediated events. Another antiepileptic drug potentiating GABA-ergic inhibition is valproate, which increases synthesis of GABA and reduces its metabolism. Among new antiepileptic drugs associated with the GABA-ergic system are tiagabine, vigabatrin, and to a certain degree--gabapentin. Tiagabine blocks neuronal and glial uptake of GABA whilst vigabatrin increases the synaptic concentration of GABA by inhibition of GABA aminotransferase. Gabapentin, probably through the activation of glutamic acid decarboxylase, leads to the increase in synaptic GABA. However, this antiepileptic drugs is also binds to specific sites within voltage-dependent calcium channels, which results in the reduced intraneuronal concentration of calcium ions. Presumably, tiagabine and vigabatrin possess only one mechanism of action, associated with the increased GABA-ergic inhibition. Although topiramate and felbamate were shown to enhance GABA-mediated events, they have additional mechanisms of action, including blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels and inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission.",

    "88": "Previously, we reported that R(+)HA-966, a weak partial agonist for the glycine/NMDA receptor, and guanfacine, a noradrenergic alpha2 agonist, have anxiolytic-like actions on the biochemical activation of the mesoprefrontal dopamine neurons and fear-induced behaviors. Here, we examined these two putative anxiolytic agents, both with primary actions independent of GABAergic systems, for their ability to alter stress-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity in the mesoprefrontal cortex and in tyrosine hydroxylase-stained, presumed dopaminergic, neurons in the ventral tegmental area. The benzodiazepine agonist, lorazepam, and partial agonist, bretazenil, were also tested in this footshock paradigm [10 x 0.5 sec, 0.8 mA paired with a 5-sec tone]. In saline-treated rats, footshock resulted in an increase in Fos-li in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices and tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled cells in the ventral tegmental area. Treatment with lorazepam or bretazenil prevented the stress-induced activation in Fos-li nuclei in all regions of the medial prefrontal cortex and in dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, the actions of the novel anxiolytic-like agents on stress-induced Fos-li were different than those observed with benzodiazepine agonists. Both putative anxiolytics, R(+)HA-966 and guanfacine, did not reduce, but significantly enhanced the stress-induced Fos-li in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, treatment with R(+)HA-966 completely blocked, while guanfacine attenuated, the stress-induced increase in the number of Fos-li, TH-li cells in the ventral tegmental area. These results indicate that the putative anxiolytics, R(+)HA-966 and guanfacine, have actions on the stress-sensitive mesoprefrontal system which appear distinct from those of traditional anxiolytics.", 
    "89": "Repeated injections of a subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 30 mg/kg IP three times weekly for 13 injections) in Wistar and hooded Lister rats resulted in kindled seizures, the extent of which varied between strains. Wistar rats achieved stage 4 of clonic-tonic seizures, whereas hooded Lister rats only reached stage 2 of convulsive waves axially through the body. Rats were killed 10 days after their final injection, and radioligand binding was used to measure the expression of NMDA receptors in cortex and hippocampus using [3H]MK-801 and [3H]L-689,560, the latter binding specifically to the NR1 subunit. [3H]Ro 15-1788 measured expression of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine binding sites containing alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 subunits. Specific analysis of GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha5 subunit, which are preferentially localized in the hippocampus, was assessed with [3H]L-655,708. In the cortex, there was no effect of strain or treatment on the K(D) or B(max) of any of the ligands. Similarly, there was no effect of strain or treatment on hippocampal [3H]L-689,560 or [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding. However, in the hippocampus there was a significant, albeit modest, effect of treatment on the B(max) of [3H]MK-801 binding and the B(max) and K(D) of [3H]L-655,708 binding, i.e., PTZ-treated rats had fewer [3H]MK-801 and [3H]L-655,708 binding sites (NMDA and alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors, respectively), but, these reductions were significant only in the relatively seizure-insensitive hooded Lister strain. This suggests that the increased susceptibility to kindling in Wistar rats is not directly related to alterations in the expression of NMDA or GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "90": "The effects of gonadectomy on shock-induced behavioral inhibition in a modified Vogel's drinking conflict model and on diazepam-induced disinhibition and sedation were investigated in adult male rats. Gonadectomy enhanced shock-induced behavioral inhibition when determined 9, 21, 45, and 65 days, but not 3 days, after operation, without affecting shock sensitivity or drinking motivation. Testosterone-substitution for 21 days following gonadectomy prevented this enhanced inhibition without significantly affecting the behavior in sham-operated rats. Diazepam produced behavioral disinhibition both in sham-operated and gonadectomized rats. However, after the highest dose (16 mg/kg, IP) the disinhibited behavior decreased only in sham-operated animals, most likely due to sedation. Moreover, whereas there was no difference in basal rotarod-performance between controls and gonadectomized rats, the latter animals were less sensitive to diazepam-induced disruption of rotarod walking ability. Sham-operated or gonadectomized animals did not differ with respect to serum diazepam levels at the postinjection times used in the behavioral tests. Taken together, gonadectomized rats were less sensitive towards diazepam-induced sedation, possibly due to a subsensitivity at or beyond GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors. Furthermore, the finding that lack of testosterone enhanced shock-induced inhibition could be interpreted to reflect increased impulse control and may involve an altered activation of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "91": "The GABA-benzodiazepine neurotransmission has been reported to be implicated in various forms of plasticity such as kindling and learning. In a previous study, we have shown that clonazepam (CZP), a GABA-benzodiazepine agonist, prevents the acquisition of behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine (MA). The present study was conducted to extend this finding by examining the effect of flumazenil (Flu), a GABA-benzodiazepine antagonist on the prevention by CZP. Rats (male Wistar-King rats) treated with MA (1 mg/kg, SC) for 10 days showed significantly enhanced motor activity compared to those treated with saline when tested with MA (1 mg/kg) after a 7-8-day withdrawal, indicating the acquisition of behavioral sensitization. Representing the previous finding, pretreatment with CZP (0.5 mg/kg) prior to MA administration prevented the acquisition of the phenomenon. Pretreatment with Flu (10 mg/kg) prior to MA administration has no influence on the acquisition of sensitization. However, pretreatment with Flu prior to CZP administration reversed the inhibitory effect of CZP. CZP showed no effect on the expression of sensitization in the sensitized rats when given prior to the MA readministration. These results strengthen the suggestion that stimulation of GABA-benzodiazepine receptors plays a role in the acquisition but not in the expression of behavioral sensitization to MA.", 
    "92": "In several previous studies, tremulous jaw movements in rats have been used to assess the effects of antiparkinsonian drugs and atypical antipsychotics. Because antihistamines such as diphenhydramine are used as antiparkinsonian agents, and atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and olanzapine have high affinity for histamine H1 receptors, the present study investigated the effects of H1 antagonists on cholinomimetic-induced jaw movements. Diphenhydramine, doxepin, and mepyramine (all injected IP 2.5-20.0 mg/kg) were assessed for their ability to block the jaw movements induced by 5.0 mg/kg of the anticholinesterase tacrine. Within this dose range, only diphenhydramine produced a robust and significant reduction in jaw movement activity. Thus, diphenhydramine was subjected to further testing, which employed procedures previously used to assess the effects of other antitremorogenic drugs, such as clozapine. Diphenhydramine did not induce jaw movement activity. In addition to suppressing jaw movement activity after acute injections, diphenhydramine also suppressed tacrine-induced jaw movements after repeated (14-day) administration. In summary, the present results show that diphenhydramine suppresses cholinomimetic-induced jaw movements, an effect that is similar to other antiparkinsonian or antitremor drugs such as anticholinergics, L-DOPA, DA antagonists, and clozapine. Nevertheless, doxepin produced only mild effects, and mepyramine, which has a higher affinity and selectivity than diphenhydramine for H1 receptors, failed to suppress cholinomimetic-induced jaw movements. These results suggest that diphenhydramine suppresses tremulous movements through a mechanism that does not depend upon antagonism of histamine H1 receptors.", 
    "93": "The present study was designed to investigate the putative anxiolytic effects of moclobemide (MOC), a reversible inhibitor of type A monoamine oxidase enzyme (RIMA) antidepressant, in an experimental model of anxiety in mice. The test selected was the light/dark aversion test. In the present investigation, an anxiogenic-like behavior was induced by light, alone as the stimulus (standard version of the test) or by pretreatment with a subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (15 mg/kg IP) 45 min before testing (\"enhanced\" version of the test). In mice, the effect of repeated administration for 2 weeks of MOC (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg IP) was compared with those of selegiline (SEL) (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg IP), an irreversible and selective MAO-B inhibitor. For comparative purpose, the chronic effect of an established reference anxiolytic, such as lorazepam (LOR) (0.025, 0.05, and 0.10 mg/kg IP), was also evaluated. Results demonstrated that PTZ-treated mice showed a decrease in the number of transitions as well as in the time spent in the lit area, when compared with vehicle controls, an effect characteristic of an anxiogenic response. This anxiogenic-like behavior was reduced by chronic administration of LOR as well as MOC, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect (as shown in the \"standard\" version of the test). In addition, the increased aversion of mice for the light compartment of the light/dark box was significantly reduced compared to PTZ-treated mice or vehicle controls. SEL failed to significantly alter the anxiogenic-like behavior induced by subconvulsant doses of PTZ. These data provide additional evidence for the anxiolytic-like effects of MOC administered chronically in the mouse.", 
    "94": "Clinical trials have extensively reported the ability of Hypericum perforatum extracts to exert a significant antidepressant activity. Hypericin, the main constituent of H. perforatum extract, is no more regarded as the active principle of the antidepressant activity of the drug. Hence, the question of which constituents are involved in the basic activity of the total extract, is still waiting for an answer. In the present study we focused our attention on the potential anxiolytic activity of H. perforatum total extract, and of some pure components such as protohypericin and a fraction containing hypericin and pseudohypericin. Herein we report that the total extract of H. perforatum increases the locomotor activity in the open field and exerts anxiolytic activity in the light-dark test, whereas the single components did not show any effect. Interestingly, the anxiolytic activity of the total extract was blocked by pretreatment of rats with the benzodiazepine antagonist Flumazenil, hence suggesting an implication of benzodiazepine receptor activation in the anxiolytic effect of H. perforatum extract. Electrophysiological studies, performed to gain more information on the mechanism of action, showed that hypericin reduced the GABA-activated chloride currents, while pseudohypericin did an opposite effect. Furthermore, both hypericin and pseudohypericin inhibited the activation of NMDA receptors.", 
    "95": "The present investigation introduces ricinine-elicited seizures as a novel chemical model of convulsive seizure. Ricinine, a neutral alkaloid obtained from the plant Ricinus communis, induces seizures when administered to mice at doses higher than 20 mg/kg. Animals presenting seizures showed a marked preconvulsive phase followed by short duration hind limb myoclonus, respiratory spasms, and death. The lethal nature of ricinine seizures is also pointed out as a good model to study the events causing death in clonic seizures, particularly those related to respiratory spasms, which are also observed in some types of human epilepsy. The behavioral signs of ricinine-elicited seizures are accompanied by electrographic alterations more evident during the preconvulsive phase in the cerebral cortex and more intense during the ictal phase both in the cortex and in the hippocampus. The ricinine-elicited seizures may be inhibited by diazepam but not by phenobarbital, phenytoin, or ethosuximide. Micromolar concentrations of ricinine cause a small decrease in the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam to cerebral cortex membranes, but do not alter the binding of other radioligands to AMPA, 5-HT(1A), muscarinic, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Although ricinine presents a cyanide radical, only higher doses of ricinine (4 mM) caused a small impairment of mitochondrial respiration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of ricinine probably involves the benzodiazepine site in the GABA(A) receptor. This may represent a new mechanism of drug-elicited seizures that may contribute to a better understanding of epilepsy and to new therapeutic approaches to this disease.",

In the present study, the Gln(28)-Leu(296), Gln(28)-Arg(276), Gln(28)-Arg(248), and Gln(28)-Glu(165) (numbering of bovine precursor protein) segments of its alpha(1) subunit were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, along with Cys(166)-Leu(296) produced previously, for structural analysis by circular dichroism and ligand binding studies by fluorescence spectroscopy. Results showed that the protein segments were rich in beta-sheet structures. Binding of the fluorescent benzodiazepine Bodipy-FL Ro-1986 was evident from fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence anisotropy measurements. The binding affinity was in the micromolar range. The binding was attributable more to Cys(166)-Leu(296) than to Gln(28)-Glu(165) and was inhibited by known central benzodiazepine site ligands. Three point mutations, Y187A, T234A, and Y237A, were found to perturb protein secondary structures. Studies with the single Trp mutants W198Y and W273Y indicated that Trp(273) was closer to the binding site than Trp(198).", 
    "97": "Granular type II cells located in the alveolar epithelium synthesize and secrete pulmonary surfactant and have specialized ion transport system. Alveolar type II cells are stimulated to secrete pulmonary surfactant by a variety of agonists. One mechanism by which extracellular signals are perceived by cells is the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are present in both peripheral tissues and central nervous system. We have previously reported the presence of high density PBRs in lung and alveolar type II cells. It is known that both PBRs and beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) play an important role in cellular Ca2+ transport. Furthermore, we have suggested earlier that PBRs are someway functionally associated with the beta-ARs. The objective of the present study was to determine whether PBRs play any role in the secretion of surfactant by alveolar type II cells. Alveolar type II cells were isolated from normal weanling guinea pigs by panning method and incubated with 3H-palmitic acid in minimum essential medium to synthesize labelled dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). After washing, the cells were treated at 37 degrees C for one hour with 10 microM isoproterenol (IP) in the presence and absence of 10 microM Ro 5-4864, an agonist for PBRs. After one hour, the release of labelled DPPC in the medium was analyzed. The control cells released DPPC without any addition of a ligand. However, the treatment of cells with IP, Ro 5-4864 and IP + Ro 5-4864 caused 24, 52 and 17]% increase in the secretion of DPPC, respectively. In another experiment, type II cells were loaded with Fura-2 dye and treated with either IP or epineprine or Ro 5-4864. Both isoproterenol and epinephrine caused a significant increase in the level of cytosolic free Ca2+. However, Ro 5-4864 caused not only a decrease in the level of cytosolic free Ca2+ but also counteracted the stimulatory effect of IP. This may suggest that while ligands for ARs stimulate Ca2+ release into cytosol, the ligand for PBRs stimulates efflux of Ca2+ in alveolar type cells. Thus, the increased secretion of surfactant by the ligand of PBRs in alveolar type II cells may be mediated through its effects on increased Ca2+ efflux.",

    "99": "In the experiments on rats in avoidance response to \"eliminated area\" and \"threatening situation\" it is found that the microinjection of monoamines and amino-acids of mediator action, adreno- and dophaminemimetics, their antagonists, and blocker of GABAA receptors picrotoxine into dorsal and ventral sections of caudate nucleus elucidates different functional value and neurochemical special features of examined neostriatum specimens in realization of anxiety states of different origin. Local injection of chlordiazepoxide, phenibutum, indoterum, campirone and campironine into aforementioned sections of the caudate nucleus reduces the state of anxiety in \"eliminated area\" and/or \"threatening situation\" response tests thus revealing the similarity with well-known effects of GABA and serotonin and substantial difference in the effects of catecholamines and glutamine acid. It is found that anti-anxious effect of benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics can be mediated through participation of neuron matrices of dorsal and ventral sections of the caudate nucleus having functionally ambiguous neurochemical profile.",

LY300164 potentiated the motor activating effects of low-dose levodopa, increasing motor activity by as much as 86% (p < 0.05), and that of medium-dose levodopa as much as 54% (p < 0.05).

    "105": "Flumazenil (20 mg/kg, i.p.)-precipitated withdrawal from chronic treatment with diazepam (DZP, 15 mg/kg, s.c. in sesame oil for 21 days) resulted in a decreased seizure threshold to the convulsant, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), infused into the tail vein; withdrawal from 21-day chronic diazepam treatment, interspersed with two periods of drug withdrawal, resulted in a greater decrease in convulsant threshold. A separate experiment showed that consumption of a sucrose solution immediately prior to precipitated withdrawal resulted in a decreased subsequent consumption of the sucrose solution; no such evidence of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) was seen in mice given prior experience of withdrawal. Thus, prior experience of withdrawal enhanced the effects of a subsequent precipitated withdrawal in increasing seizure sensitivity, but weakened the ability of this withdrawal to serve as an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). The weakening of the aversive properties of precipitated withdrawal may reflect habituation to the withdrawal stimulus, and was accompanied by a loss of the ability of withdrawal to induce c-fos expression in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, an area sensitive to both novel, and stressful, as well as rewarding stimuli.", 
    "106": "The degree of postsynaptic type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAA receptor) occupancy was investigated by using the benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem. This drug increases the affinity of GABAA receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at room temperature (Perrais & Ropert 1999, J. Neurosci., 19, 578) leading to an enhancement of synaptic current amplitudes if receptors are not fully occupied by the released transmitter. We recorded miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) from eight different cell types in three brain regions of rats and mice. Receptors in every cell type were benzodiazepine sensitive, as 10-20 microM zolpidem prolonged the decays of mIPSCs (151-184% of control). The amplitude of the GABAA receptor-mediated events was significantly enhanced in dentate granule cells, CA1 pyramidal cells, hippocampal GABAergic interneurons, cortical layer V pyramidal cells, cortical layer V interneurons, and in cortical layer II/III interneurons. An incomplete postsynaptic GABAA receptor occupancy is thus predicted in these cells. In contrast, zolpidem induced no significant change in mIPSC amplitudes recorded from layer II/III pyramidal cells, suggesting full GABAA receptor occupancy. Moreover, different degrees of receptor occupancy could be found at distinct GABAergic synapses on a given cell. For example, of the two distinct populations of zolpidem-sensitive mIPSCs recorded in olfactory bulb granule cells, the amplitude of only one type was significantly enhanced by the drug. Thus, at synapses that generate mIPSCs, postsynaptic receptor occupancy is cell type and synapse specific, reflecting local differences in the number of receptors or in the transmitter concentration in the synaptic cleft.",

An open dose-escalation design was used to study doses from 0.2 to 50 mg in 18 healthy male volunteers. In the second study doses from 50 to 150 mg were investigated in 14 healthy males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study. Deramciclane was rapidly absorbed from the GI-tract and T(max) was 2-4 h. The elimination half-life increased from about 20 h to about 32 h with the increasing dose. Nevertheless, the AUC(0-infinity) values increased linearly within the studies over the dose ranges of 3-50 and 50-150 mg. However, the increase was more than the ratio of the dose over the total dose range of 3-150 mg. Therefore, non-linear pharmacokinetics of deramciclane at high doses cannot be excluded. N-desmethyl deramciclane, which is the active metabolite of deramciclane, was determined in plasma. C(max) was reached at about 6 h. The AUC(0-48 h) for the N-desmethyl metabolite was about one third of the AUC(0-infinity) of the parent compound and the ratio remained constant at each dose level. Deramciclane was safe, and was well tolerated at each dose level.", 
    "110": "Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity has been shown to contribute to cellular dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Increasing inhibitory function through stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors may attenuate excitotoxic effects and improve outcome. The present experiment examined the effects of diazepam, a positive modulator at the GABA(A) receptor, on survival and cognitive performance in traumatically brain-injured animals. In experiment 1, 15 min prior to central fluid percussion brain injury, rats (n=8 per group) were injected (i.p.) with saline or diazepam (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg). Additional rats (n=8) were surgically prepared but not injured (sham-injury). Rats pre-treated with the 5 mg/kg dose of diazepam had significantly lower mortality (0%) than injured, saline-treated rats (53%). Also, diazepam-treated (5 mg/kg) rats had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze test performed 11-15 days post-injury. In experiment 2, at 15 min post-injury, rats were given either saline (n=5) or 5 mg/kg diazepam (n=6). Rats treated with diazepam did not differ in mortality from injured rats treated with vehicle. However, rats treated with diazepam at 15 min post-injury had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze than injured, vehicle-treated rats. In experiment 3, the post-injury administration of bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg, n=8), a GABA(A) antagonist, increased Morris water maze goal latencies compared to injured animals treated with saline (n=8). These results suggest that enhancing inhibitory function during the acute post-injury period produces beneficial effects on both survival and outcome following experimental TBI.", 
    "111": "A high-affinity positive modulator of the GABA(A) receptor complex, ganaxolone, is a 3beta-methylated analog of the naturally occurring neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone. In the present study, ganaxolone was tested for its ability to (1) suppress seizures (clonic and tonic) and lethality induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in PTZ-kindled mice (anticonvulsive effect) and (2) to attenuate the development of sensitization to the convulsive and lethal effects of PTZ in kindled mice (anti-epileptogenic effect) when given as a pretreatment prior to each PTZ injection during kindling acquisition. Two classical antiepileptic drugs, diazepam and valproate, were tested for comparison. All three drugs dose-dependently suppressed tonic seizures and lethality induced by PTZ in kindled mice; only ganaxolone was effective against clonic seizures. Ganaxolone showed anti-epileptogenic properties as it reduced the sensitivity of kindled mice to the convulsive (clonic and tonic seizures) and lethal effects of PTZ. Diazepam showed anti-epileptogenic effects against tonic seizures and lethality, but not clonic seizures; valproate was ineffective in preventing development of any of these effects. Sensitivity to PTZ-induced seizures and lethality was not affected in mice with a history of repeated treatment with ganaxolone, diazepam, or valproate. The drugs had effects on ambulatory activity that ranged from no effect (ganaxolone) through moderate impairment (diazepam) to marked disruption (valproate). Taken together, the results of the present study add to accumulating evidence of the unique anticonvulsive/behavioral profile of neuroactive steroids.",

Rats with chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) are highly anxious and exhibit panic-like responses to peripheral lactate infusions similar to patients with panic disorder. Using these panic-prone rats, we tested the efficacy of LY354740 in preventing the lactate-induced panic-like response, comparing it to alprazolam, a clinically effective anti-panic drug. Rats were fitted with femoral arterial and venous catheters and implanted with Alzet pumps infusing the GABA synthesis inhibitor L-allylglycine into the DMH. After four days of recovery, they were confirmed to be panic-prone to lactate infusions as indicated by increases in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and \"anxiety\" measured in the social interaction test. Next, they were pretreated with either vehicle, LY354740 (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg) or alprazolam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) and re-challenged with lactate infusions. LY354740 treatment was equally efficacious as alprazolam in preventing lactate-induced panic attacks in this model. These data suggest that LY354740 could be a novel anti-panic drug, as effective as alprazolam in acute treatment.",

    "114": "Electroencephalography (EEG) was applied to evaluate the validity of the paw pinch reflex as an indicator of anaesthetic depth in rats which are anaesthetized with a single intraperitoneal dose of pentobarbital. After induction of the anaesthesia, characterized by the rapid loss of the animals' ability to maintain upright posture, the EEG of 10 out of 11 rats was dominated by paroxysmal (burst suppression) activity, associated with unconsciousness. In seven out of 11 rats, the paw pinch reflex was lost after onset of paroxysmal electroencephalographic activity. However, the paw pinch reflex remained present in four out of 11 animals, demonstrating that the response is independent of cortical activity. In five out of seven rats, the EEG still showed paroxysmal activity when the paw pinch reflex was regained. However, in two other rats the EEG returned to a pattern similar to that shown by awake animals, 4 and 21 min respectively, before the reflex was regained. These data indicate that in the pentobarbital-anaesthetized rat, presence of the paw pinch reflex is not related to the level of depression of electrical activity in the cerebral cortex, and consequently is probably not related to the level of consciousness. Based upon these findings it is concluded that the paw pinch reflex is unreliable as a sole indicator of anaesthetic depth.",

In series 1, midazolam caused significant anxiolysis and sedation within 3 to 4 min, without a significant difference between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg doses for any of the studied parameters. In series 2, after intranasal midazolam administration of 0.4 mg/kg, plasma concentrations attained a maximum (Cmax) of 0.13 +/- 0.04 mg/l at 5 min (median Tmax) and remained higher than 0.04 mg/l until 60 min. The bioavailability factor (F) in this study was F = 0.64 +/- 0.17 by the intranasal route. The terminal half-life (T1/2 lambda z) = 145 +/- 138 min was comparable with the i.v. administration half-life (158 +/- 127 min). In conclusion, optimal intranasal midazolam dose in piglets was 0.2 mg/kg, which procures rapid and reliable sedation, adapted to laboratory piglets.", 
    "116": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders and has a poor prognosis, although it is often thought to be a minor complaint. This disorder has a chronic course of 5-15 years and longer. Long-term treatment with the commonly used benzodiazepines is controversial because of concerns over tolerance and dependence. We performed a thorough search of the literature for clinical trials of a duration of over 2 months conducted in patients with generalized anxiety disorder in order to identify any successful long-term treatment of this disorder. Only eight long-term reports of studies conducted in well-defined homogeneous groups of patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder were found with the methodology of these studies presenting a number of limiting factors. The results are inconclusive and no reference drug could be identified. In addition, an adequate evaluation of the long-term treatment of GAD has not yet been performed.", 
    "117": "Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to stop seizures in animal models with injection of antiepileptic medication directly onto the seizure focus. The present experiments describe automated detection and focal therapy for seizures in the laboratory setting. Focal seizures were created in Sprague-Dawley rats using bicuculline, a GABA antagonist. Computerized detection of seizures was linked to a programmable infusion pump to deliver either diazepam (DZP) or pH-balanced vehicle (VEH) directly onto the seizure focus. Mean numbers of seizures following initial delivery of drug were 2.9+/-1.45 for the VEH-treated group and 0.2+/-0.42 for the DZP-treated group (P<0.0001, Student's t-test, nonpaired, one-tailed). In another series of experiments, early injection of DZP shortened seizure duration. Three DZP-treated animals died. This model provides proof-in-principle for the development of a clinically applicable treatment for intractable partial epilepsy. Such therapy might avoid some of the problems inherent to systemic administration of antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "118": "The bispectral (BIS) index has been used to interpret electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to predict the level of sedation and loss of consciousness in patients undergoing general anesthesia. It was the purpose of this project to assess the usefulness of BIS technology in determining the level of sedation in patients undergoing third molar extraction under conscious sedation.", 
    "119": "Twenty-five subjects undergoing third molar extraction in an outpatient setting were analyzed. The EEG activity was recorded continually during surgery using a microcomputer (Aspect-1050 Monitor; Aspect Co, Natick, MA) with real-time bispectral data obtained by EEG skin electrodes through a frontotemporal montage. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scale was used to subjectively assess the level of sedation observed by the anesthetist before initiating the sedation procedure and then at 5-minute intervals until the end of the procedure. The BIS level was simultaneously recorded. The initial sedation was accomplished using a standard dose of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1.5 microg/kg) followed by a 10- to 30-mg bolus of propofol until a level of sedation at which the patient's eyes were closed and he or she was responsive only to vigorous stimulation or repeated loud calling of their name (OAA/S level of 1 to 2). Local anesthesia was then administered. Additional doses of sedative medication (midazolam or propofol) were given during the procedure to maintain the desired level of sedation (an OAA/S level of 2 to 3). The time and dose of the drug given were recorded. The level of sedation based on a single anesthetist's interpretation (OAA/S) and the BIS readings were then compared.", 
    "120": "A strong positive relationship between the BIS index and OAA/S readings was found (P < .0001). Pairwise comparisons of mean BIS index and its corresponding OAA/S level were significantly different from each other (P < .003) except for OAA/S levels 2 and 3 (P = .367).", 
    "121": "BIS technology offers an objective, ordinal means of assessing the depth of sedation. There was a strong relationship between the objective BIS values and subjective assessment (OAA/S scale) of the depth of anesthesia. This can be invaluable in providing an objective assessment of sedation in oral and maxillofacial surgery where it may be difficult to determine the level of sedation clinically.", 
    "122": "The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of intramuscular droperidol to other intramuscularly administered agents used in the management of acutely agitated patients. Twenty-seven inpatients with a history of brain injury were prospectively monitored over a period of 2 months. Data collected for each episode of agitation include: dose, number of doses, time to achieve an adequate response or calming effect, post-episodic functioning, treatment-emergent side effects, and other patient demographics. A retrospective medical records review was also performed on the same cohort, to compare clinical outcomes associated with other intramuscular agents previously used for acute agitation. Time to achieve calming was significantly shorter with intramuscular droperidol (mean = 27.0 minutes) compared to intramuscular haloperidol, lorazepam, or diphenhydramine (group mean = 36.2 minutes, p = 0.02). Of the three comparative agents, the time to achieve calming was the fastest with lorazepam (mean = 35.0 minutes), and slower with diphenhydramine (mean = 42.6 minutes) and haloperidol (mean = 43.0 minutes). Single doses of droperidol controlled agitation more frequently than did single doses of comparative agents, and there was less post-episodic sedation with droperidol following release from seclusion or restraints. Both groups were similar in regard to the incidence of treatment-emergent events. This data represents the first published experience supporting the effectiveness of droperidol in reducing acute agitation in persons with brain injury. Follow-up studies with prospective, double-blind, parallel treatment groups should be performed to validate these preliminary findings.", 
    "123": "The binding of the anti-inflammatory agent kebuzone (CAS 853-34-9) to human serum albumin (HSA) was examined by means of high performance liquid affinity chromatography. Phenylbutazone and diazepam, the binding properties of which were an object of our previous work, were used as markers for the major supposed binding sites on HSA. It was established that kebuzone binds to the high-affinity phenylbutazone binding sites as well as to the low-affinity diazepam binding sites. The estimated values of the equilibrium affinity constants were 5.9 x 10(4) l/mol and 1.7 x 10(3) l/mol, respectively, suggesting a low binding affinity for kebuzone. A stepwise mechanism of the binding process could be proposed: primary at phenylbutazone sites, and secondary at the diazepam sites. The binding behavior of kebuzone was very similar to that of the structurally related compound phenylbutazone. The observed lower affinity is well explained in view of the lower lipophilicity of kebuzone.", 
    "124": "We investigated the effect of a small dose of midazolam, ketamine, droperidol or lidocaine on the propofol dose required for hypnosis during induction of general anaesthesia. These drugs were randomly administered to 100 patients about to undergo scheduled surgery. Propofol was then infused at a rate of 250 microg kg-1 min-1 and the hypnotic dose to produce hypnosis was evaluated. Midazolam (20 microg kg-1) and droperidol (20 microg kg-1) significantly reduced the mean hypnotic dose of propofol (mean) S.D.) compared with the placebo (43.7 +/- 17.8 mg, 61.9 +/- 10.6 mg and 72.5 +/- 27.7 mg after pretreatment with midazolam, droperidol and placebo, respectively), whereas ketamine (0.1 mg kg-1) and lidocaine (1 mg kg-1) did not significantly affect the hypnotic dose of propofol (63. 1 +/- 25.6 mg and 65.1 +/- 24.8 mg, respectively). Only midazolam when compared with saline administration, (176 +/- 66 s and 298 +/- 126 s, respectively), shortened the time to achieve hypnosis. The changes in blood pressure (non-invasive) and heart rate were not significantly different in all groups during the induction of anaesthesia and oro-tracheal intubation. These results raise the possibility that new combinations of central nervous system drugs, such as droperidol and propofol, have a potential to reduce the dose of intravenous anaesthetics, including propofol, that produce hypnosis without significant adverse effects.", 
    "125": "The biochemical and behavioral effects of a nonpeptidic, selective, and brain-penetrant agonist at the ORL1 receptor are reported herein. This low molecular weight compound [(1S,3aS)-8- (2,3,3a,4,5, 6-hexahydro-1H-phenalen-1-yl)-1-phenyl-1,3,8-triaza- spiro[4. 5]decan-4-one] has high affinity for recombinant human ORL1 receptors and has 100-fold selectivity for ORL1 over other members of the opioid receptor family. It is a full agonist at these receptors and elicits dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effects in a set of validated models of distinct types of anxiety states in the rat (i.e., elevated plus-maze, fear-potentiated startle, and operant conflict). When given systemically, the compound has an efficacy and potency comparable to those of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic such as alprazolam or diazepam. However, this compound is differentiated from a classical benzodiazepine anxiolytic by a lack of efficient anti-panic-like activity, absence of anticonvulsant properties, and lack of effects on motor performance and cognitive function at anxiolytic doses (0.3 to 3 mg/kg i.p.). No significant change in intracranial self-stimulation performance and pain reactivity was observed in this dose range. Higher doses of this compound (>/=10 mg/kg) induced disruption in rat behavior. These data confirm the notable anxiolytic-like effects observed at low doses with the orphanin FQ/nociceptin neuropeptide given locally into the brain and support a role for orphanin FQ/nociceptin in adaptive behavioral fear responses to stress.", 
    "126": "Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to replace alanine 305 with phenylalanine (A305F) and serine (A305S) in the active site of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Enzyme kinetics for diazepam, erythromycin, nifedipine, and testosterone metabolism have been determined for both mutants and wild-type CYP3A4. The A305F mutation abolished diazepam oxidase activity and reduced the S(50) and V(max) for erythromycin N-demethylase activity from 17 to 10 microM and from 3.2 to 1.2 pmol product/min/pmol P450, respectively. The V(max) for testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity was also significantly reduced, from 2.3 to 0.6 pmol product/min/pmol P450, whereas the S(50) increased from 33 to 125 microM. The nifedipine oxidase activity was diminished to a lesser extent, down from 6.5 to 4.9 pmol product/min/pmol P450, whereas the S(50) increased from 9 to 42 microM. The K(i) for ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 selective inhibitor, was increased more than 10-fold from 0.050 to 0.55 microM, from 0.052 to 0.73 microM, and from 0.043 to 2.2 microM by the A305F mutation when measured against erythromycin, nifedipine, and testosterone metabolism activities, respectively. Similarly, the inhibition constants of the broader specificity inhibitors; clotrimazole, econazole, and miconazole were increased 3- to 15-fold by the A305F mutation. In contrast, the A305S mutation increased testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase (V(max) = 2.9 pmol product/min/pmol P450) and erythromycin N-demethylase (V(max) = 5.1 pmol product/min/pmol P450) activities, but reduced nifedipine oxidase activity (V(max) = 4.6 pmol product/min/pmol P450). K(i) values for ketoconazole and other azole inhibitors were unchanged by the A305S mutation. It is proposed that in CYP3A4, the mutagenesis of alanine 305 to a phenylalanine increases the steric hindrance of the catalytic center, thereby greatly reducing azole inhibitor binding affinity, but maintaining monoogygenase activity.",

If laboratory tests of liver function revealed alterations, hepatitis B and C viral serology, thyroid hormones, and use of alcohol and drugs were investigated, and liver ultrasound scans were done. Liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were done only in patients for whom these studies were considered necessary.", 
    "129": "ten patients had hypertransaminasemia (50%), ascribed to benzodiazepine use in 1 patient, chronic HCV hepatitis in 1, and celiac disease in 8. In all of these last patients except 1 (benzodiazepine use), laboratory values returned to normal after 4-10 months on a gluten-free diet.", 
    "130": "celiac disease was frequently associated with hypertransaminasemia. In most patients transaminase levels returned to normal within 1 year after dietary gluten intake was restricted. If alterations in laboratory values persist, other causes that may be related (e.g., autoimmunity or tumors) or unrelated to celiac disease (e.g., virus) must be ruled out.", 
    "131": "The possible effect of a cholecystokinin-8 agonist (caerulein) and antagonists (MK-329 and L365,260) on the development of morphine dependence and withdrawal were investigated in rats. Caerulein treatment (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) increased the incidence of naloxone-induced withdrawal syndromes and delayed the extinction of morphine-conditioned place preference in morphine-dependent animals. The signs of the morphine withdrawal syndromes and the formation of morphine-conditioned place preference were suppressed by pretreatment with L365,260 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) and not affected by pretreatment with MK-329 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). The present study demonstrated CCK, acting on CCK-B receptors, participates in the development of the opiate dependence. These findings suggest that CCK-B receptor antagonists might be of some value in the treatment and prevention the relapse of opiate addicts.", 
    "132": "Patients suffering from some psychiatric and neurological disorders demonstrate abnormally high levels of saccadic distractibility when carrying out the antisaccade task. This has been particularly thoroughly demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia. A large body of evidence has been accumulated from studies of patients which suggests that such eye movement abnormalities may arise from frontal lobe dysfunction. The psychopharmacology of saccadic distractibility is less well understood, but is relevant both to interpreting patient studies and to establishing the neurological basis of their findings. Twenty healthy subjects received lorazepam 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg, sertraline 50 mg and placebo in a balanced, repeated measures study design. Antisaccade, no-saccade, visually guided saccade and smooth pursuit tasks were carried out and the effects of practice and drugs measured. Lorazepam increased direction errors in the antisaccade and no-saccade tasks in a dose-dependent manner. Sertraline had no effect on these measures. Correlation showed a statistically significant, but rather weak, association between direction errors and smooth pursuit measures. Practice was shown to have a powerful effect on antisaccade direction errors. This study supports our previous work by confirming that lorazepam reliably worsens saccadic distractibility, in contrast to other psychotropic drugs such as sertraline and chlorpromazine. Our results also suggest that other studies in this field, particularly those using parallel groups design, should take account of practice effects.", 
    "133": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of (-)-nicotine on cerebral benzodiazepine receptors (BzR) with radiotracer methods. The effect of (-)-nicotine on BzR was examined in in vitro studies using chronic (-)-nicotine-treated rats using 3H-diazepam. The in vitro radioreceptor assay showed a 14% increase in the maximum number of binding sites of BzR in chronic (-)-nicotine-treated rats in comparison with the control rats. Moreover, a convenient in vivo uptake index of 125I-iomazenil was calculated and a higher uptake of the radioactivity was observed in the chronic (-)-nicotine-treated group than in the control group. Although further studies of the mechanism of (-)-nicotine on such BzR changes are required, an increase in the amount of BzR in the cerebral cortex was found in rats that underwent chronic (-)-nicotine treatment, and this result contributed to the understanding of the effects of (-)-nicotine and smoking on neural functions.", 
    "134": "We report on three cases of acutely manic prepubertal children diagnosed with bipolar disorder who were treated with olanzapine in addition to their existing mood stabilizer regimens. All three had marked improvement of their manic symptoms within 3-5 days of beginning olanzapine therapy as measured by clinician-rated instruments. Adverse effects included sedation and weight gain. These results suggest that olanzapine may have an antimanic or mood stabilizing effect in acutely manic children with bipolar disorder.", 
    "135": "Diazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, better known as a melatonin blocker in mammals, was injected into pigeons at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight/day for 1 h, 1 day, 7 days and 15 days. This was done to investigate whether diazepam-induced changes in the pineal gland were reflected in the functioning of the adrenal gland. The results indicated that diazepam caused inhibition of pineal function and the degree of inhibition was very much time dependent. In addition, the pineal gland was unable to modulate the adrenomedullary hormonal titre yet it considerably influenced the physiology of the adrenal cortex.", 
    "136": "Recent investigations in our sleep outpatient clinic demonstrated that 30% of patients exhibited organic and 70% nonorganic sleep disorders, with 41% showing as an additional diagnosis neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, 31% affective disorders and 15% mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the acute effects of the imidazopyridine zolpidem on objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality in the largest of the above-mentioned groups. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, 15 patients (9 females and 6 males aged 51.1 + 11. 3 years) diagnosed as having nonorganic insomnia (ICD-10: F 51.0) related to neurotic and stress-related disorders (F 1.1:12, F 41.2:2 and F 43.2:1) were included. Objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality measures were investigated in 3 subsequent nights in the sleep laboratory (adaptation, baseline/placebo and zolpidem 10 mg night), utilizing clinical, polysomnographic, psychometric and psychophysiological methods. The drug-free patients were matched according to age and sex with 15 normal healthy controls (age 51.2 + 11.8 years). Statistical analysis of polysomnographic variables demonstrated a significant lengthening of the total sleep period (TSP) and total sleep time (TST), an improvement in sleep efficiency and a shortening of sleep latencies after zolpidem as compared with placebo. These changes were opposite to the differences between patients and controls. Concerning sleep architecture, zolpidem increased the length of S4 and S3 + S4 as compared with placebo. Subjective sleep and awakening quality and the thymopsychic variables drive, mood, affectivity and wakefulness in the morning showed no significant changes, as a significant improvement had already occurred from the adaptation to the baseline/placebo night. Noopsychic variables (attention, concentration, attention variability, numerical memory, fine motor activity, reaction time measures) showed similar findings. Moreover, subjective sleep and awakening quality, thymopsychic and noopsychic measures during baseline/placebo recordings did not differ significantly from normative data (except for fine motor activity). Psychophysiological measures did not show any significant alterations either, except for a decrease in systolic blood pressure in the evening.", 
    "137": "As compared with placebo, zolpidem induced a significant improvement in objective sleep quality, mainly by increasing TSP, TST and sleep efficiency and shortening sleep latencies, thereby normalizing the disorder of initiating and maintaining sleep. Deep sleep stages S3 + S4 increased (although at baseline/placebo these stages did not differ from controls), while S1, S2 and SREM did not change significantly. Subjective sleep and awakening quality as well as thymopsychic and noopsychic performance in the morning mainly showed a placebo and 'first- night effect' phenomenon in these patients. Thus, the changes induced by zolpidem were somewhat different from those after classical benzodiazepines.", 
    "138": "The migraine--a benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood complex is the most frequent etiology of pediatric dizziness, with an incidence of 34.7%. We present a series of 34 children in whom this entity was diagnosed. We describe the most important characteristics and discuss the possible etiological factors. We review the theories about a common pathophysiological origin for migraine, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, and paroxysmal torticollis. Evolution of these entities confirms the idea of a common origin and a different vestibular symptomatology, depending on the age of the child experiencing dizziness.", 
    "139": "We investigated the necessity of the second additional administration of intravenous midazolam for sedation during spinal anesthesia and the adequate dose if necessary. Fifty patients with ages between 35 to 70 years for spinal anesthesia were administered midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 intravenously during surgery. Thirty-four patients opened their eyes spontaneously and to these patients midazolam 1 mg was administered every three minutes until patients closed their eyes. All 34 patients closed their eyes with 1 mg of midazolam. Patients opened their eyes again at 47 +/- 16 minutes (mean +/- SD) after the first dose (0.05 mg.kg-1) and at 24 +/- 14 minutes after the second dose (1 mg). The decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation after the administration of midazolam were less after the second administration than those after the first one. The percent of patients with amnesia was larger in the patients with only first administration than those with the second dose. These results suggest that the additional dose of midazolam is not necessary after intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 until patients open their eyes and the additional 1 mg is useful even after patients have opened their eyes.", 
    "140": "Reduction of nitro-substituted compounds, 1,4-benzodiazepine-2-ones, dibenzo[b,f]-1,4-diazepines, quinolones, and quinoxalinones, by Escherichia coli cells was studied. Physicochemical methods demonstrated the formation of corresponding amines. 4-(p-Nitrophenyl)-1H-6-R-quinolones-2 were nor reduced by Escherichia coli cells. Regiospecific reduction of 2,4-dinitro-5H-11-(p-R-phenyl)-dibenzo[b,f]-1,4-diazepines and 4-(2'-R-3',5'-dinitro)-benzoyl-3,4-dihydroquinoxalinones-2 was shown to result in the formation of 2-nitro-4-amino-5H-11-(p-R-phenyl)-dibenzo[b,f]-1,4-diazepines and 4-(2'-R-3'-nitro-5'-amino)-benzoyl-3,4-dihydroquinoxalinones-2, respectively. Methods for microbiological reduction of nitro compounds and immobilization of Escherichia coli cells into carrageenan and its modified forms were elaborated."
