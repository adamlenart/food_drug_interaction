One study (Jackson 2004) reported a significant reduction in duration of treatment and admission to the nursery for infants receiving morphine compared to phenobarbitone. One study (Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate.

One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery admission for infants on morphine. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only.

Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random allocation methods in four studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in three studies. Phenobarbitone compared to supportive care alone has not been shown to reduce treatment failure or time to regain birthweight (one study). However, the duration of supportive care given to infants was significantly reduced (MD -162.1 mins/day, 95% CI -249.2, -75.1). Comparing phenobarbitone to diazepam, meta-analysis of two studies found phenobarbitone produced a significant reduction in treatment failure (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24, 0.62). There was no significant difference in duration of treatment or hospital stay. Comparing phenobarbitone with chlorpromazine, one study found no significant difference in treatment failure rate. No data for neurodevelopment reported by treatment group of allocation were available. No trials were eligible that assessed clonidine for NAS. In infants treated with an opiate, a small quasi-random study reported a reduced severity of withdrawal. Infants were weaned from an opiate more quickly which allowed earlier hospital discharge and reduced hospital costs. These findings may reflect the low dose of opiate used for initial treatment and the policy of discharging infants home on phenobarbitone but not morphine.",

Phenobarbitone, compared to diazepam, reduces treatment failure. In infants treated with an opiate, the addition of phenobarbitone may reduce withdrawal severity. Further trials are required to determine if this finding is applicable when a higher initial dose of opiate is used, and determine the effects of phenobabritone on infant development. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of chlorpromazine or clonidine in newborn infants with NAS. Clonidine and chlorpromazine should only be used in the context of a randomised clinical trial. This review should be taken in conjunction with the review \"Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants\" (Osborn 2002a) which indicates that an opiate is the preferred initial therapy for NAS.", 
    "35": "Status epilepticus is a state of prolonged or recurrent seizure activity that is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. At a cellular level, status epilepticus results from a failure of normal inhibitory pathways, primarily mediated by gamma-n-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting via GABA(A) receptors. This loss of inhibitory drive allows the activation of excitatory feedback loops, leading to repetitive, synchronous firing of large groups of neurons. As seizure activity continues, there is further decline in GABAergic function. Continued excitatory input mediated primarily by glutamate leads to neuronal cell death. These alterations in inhibitory and excitatory pathways have important implications for the pharmacologic management of status epilepticus. Currently recommended agents act primarily through the GABA(A) receptor and have been shown to become less effective in status epilepticus of longer duration. Agents designed to inhibit glutamate activity show promise both in the treatment of status epilepticus and in the prevention of associated neuronal injury.", 
    "36": "Recent studies indicate that GABAergic ligands modulate abuse-related effects of cocaine. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a mechanistically diverse group of GABAergic ligands on the discriminative stimulus and reinforcing effects of cocaine in rats. One group of rats was trained to discriminate 5.6 mg/kg cocaine from saline in a two-lever, food-reinforced, drug discrimination procedure. In two other groups, responding was maintained by cocaine (0-3.2 mg/kg/injection) or liquid food (0-100%) under a fixed ratio 5 schedule. Six GABA agonists were tested: the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol, the GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen, the GABA transaminase inhibitor gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG), and three GABA-A receptor modulators (the barbiturate pentobarbital, the high-efficacy benzodiazepine midazolam, and the low-efficacy benzodiazepine enazenil). When tested alone, none of the compounds substituted fully for the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. As acute pretreatments, select doses of midazolam and pentobarbital produced 2.2- to 3.6-fold rightward shifts in the cocaine dose-effect function. In contrast, muscimol, baclofen, GVG, and enazenil failed to alter the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. In assays of cocaine- and food-maintained responding, midazolam and pentobarbital decreased cocaine self-administration at doses 9.6- and 3.3-fold lower, respectively, than those that decreased food-maintained responding. In contrast, muscimol, baclofen, and GVG decreased cocaine self-administration at doses that also decreased food-maintained responding. Enazenil failed to alter cocaine self-administration. Together with previous studies, these data suggest that among mechanistically diverse GABA agonists, high-efficacy GABA-A modulators may be the most effective for modifying the abuse-related effects of cocaine.", 
    "37": "The restless legs syndrome is a common disorder that encompasses an idiopathic form of genetic or unknown origin and symptomatic forms associated with many causes. Symptomatic forms occur during pregnancy and are coincident with uraemia, iron depletion, polyneuropathy, spinal disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis. For the hereditary forms, at least three gene loci, located on chromosomes 12, 14, and 9, have been traced so far. Prevalence in the general population is between 3% and 9%, increases with age, and is higher in women than in men. Treatment is needed only in the moderate to severe forms of the disorder and mostly in elderly people. Pathophysiology and treatment may be closely linked to the dopaminergic system and iron metabolism. Dopaminergic treatment with levodopa and dopamine agonists is the first choice in idiopathic restless legs syndrome, but augmentation and rebound should be monitored in long-term treatment. Various other drugs, such as opioids, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines, provide alternative treatment possibilities.",

In phase I trials in healthy volunteers, lesopitron was well tolerated in single doses up to 50 mg, and up to 45 mg/day in repeated doses [234400]. Lesopitron has negligible effects on alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors [162653], and was more potent than structurally-related 5-HT1A agonists in rat social interaction and marmoset anxiety models. It also countered benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced anxiety in rodents [232978]. The acute toxicity of lesopitron is low and it does not potentiate the effects of alcohol or barbiturates. Long-term usage led to reductions in plasma glucose, triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol [232984].

However, the raise of corticosterone secretion in D rats was dramatically increased (300%) compared to ND rats, indicating a hypersensitised state revealed by this stressful situation.

    "54": "Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is a disease in which there is gross distension of the stomach with fluid or gas and gastric malpositioning. It causes pathology of multiple organ systems and is rapidly fatal. It is common in large- and giant-breed dogs. The disease appears to have a familial predisposition. Thoracic depth/width ratio also appears to predispose dogs to GDV. Implicated dietary factors include dietary particle size, frequency of feeding, speed of eating, aerophagia and an elevated feed bowl. A fearful temperament and stressful events may also predispose dogs to GDV. Abdominal distension, non-productive retching, restlessness, signs of shock, tachypnoea and dyspnoea are possible clinical signs. Initial treatment includes treatment of shock and gastric decompression. Surgical treatment should be performed promptly. There are no studies comparing the use of different anaesthetic agents in the anaesthetic management of GDV. Pre-medication with an opioid/benzodiazepine combination has been recommended. Induction agents that cause minimal cardiovascular changes such as opioids, neuroactive steroidal agents and etomidate are recommended. Anaesthesia should be maintained with an inhalational agent. Surgical therapy involves decompression, correction of gastric malpositioning, debridement of necrotic tissue, and gastropexy. Options for gastropexy include incisional, tube, circumcostal, belt-loop, incorporating, and laparoscopic gastropexy. Expected mortality with surgical therapy is 15-24%. Prognostic factors include mental status on presentation, presence of gastric necrosis, presence of cardiac arrhythmia and plasma lactate levels. Prophylactic gastropexy should be considered in dogs identified as being at high risk.", 
    "55": "This review examines the properties of chemical immobilising agents of use or potential use in deer for velvet antler removal. The alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, xylazine, is the most commonly used agent for chemical restraint of stags for this purpose in New Zealand. This compound is often combined with an opioid or ketamine to enhance its effectiveness. Concerns about the carcinogenic potential of a xylazine metabolite have led to a call by the deer industry to limit the use of this drug and stimulated enquiry into alternatives. The potent pure opioid agonists, fentanyl, carfentanil and etorphine, are less effective than xylazine when used alone, and their use presents greater risk to operators and animals and is subject to more stringent legal restrictions. Newer alpha-2-adrenergic agonists, detomidine and medetomidine, are more potent than xylazine and unlikely to result in carcinogenic metabolites. Availability of specific alpha-2-adrenergic antagonists further enhances the usefulness of these drugs. The dissociative agent, ketamine, has proven useful for immobilisation of various domestic and wildlife species and captive species of deer but undesirable side effects and the low concentration, relative to the effective dose, of currently available formulations limit its usefulness. Combination of a dissociative agent with an alpha-2-adrenergic agent reduces the required dose of both and enhances their efficacy. A commercially available combination of the dissociative anaesthetic agent, tiletamine, and the benzodiazepine, zolazepam, is more potent than ketamine and induction times are faster. This combination can be manipulated to varying concentrations by dissolution with alpha-2-adrenergic agents. A long-acting neuroleptic agent, zuclopenthixol, has recently been investigated for calming deer and may be an alternative to classical sedative-immobilising agents. Most chemical immobilisation agents used alone or in combination produce respiratory depression and supplemental oxygen has been recommended. All would likely result in some form of chemical residues in velvet antler.",

Atorvastatin was a moderate competitive inhibitor of CYP 3A4 with an inhibitory constant (K(i)) of 12.4 (95% CI 4.65-20.06) micromol.l(-1). Fluvastatin was a weak non-competitive inhibitor of CYP 3A4 with a K(i) of 94.3 (95% CI 55.01-133.5) micromol.l(-1). Both atorvastatin and fluvastatin inhibit the CYP 3A4-mediated metabolism of midazolam in vitro.", 
    "61": "Nervous and immune systems mutually cooperate via release of mediators of both neurological and immunological derivation. Adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) is a product of the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis (HPAA) which stimulates secretion of corticosteroids from adrenals. In turn, corticosteroids modulate the immune response in virtue of their anti-inflammatory activity. On the other hand, catecholamines, products of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), regulate immune function by acting on specific beta-adrenergic receptors. Conversely, cytokines released by monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes, upon antigenic stimulation, are able to cross the blood-brain-barrier, thus modulating nervous functions (e.g., thermoregulation, sleep, and appetite). However, cytokines are locally produced in the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, thus contributing to the development of anorexic, pyrogenic, somnogenic and behavioural effects. Besides pathogens and/or their products, the so-called stressors are able to activate both HPAA and SNS, thus influencing immune responses. In this respect, many studies conducted in medical students taking exams have evidenced an array of stress-induced immune alterations. Phobic disorders and migraine without aura (MWA) represent examples of stress-related disorders in which phagocytic immune deficits, endotoxemia and exaggerated levels of proinflammatory cytokines [Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF- alpha), and interleukin- 1 beta] have been detected. Quite interestingly, administration of a thymic hormone could ameliorate clinical symptoms in phobic patients. In MWA patients, a beta-blocker, propranolol, could mitigate migraine, whose cessation coincided with a drop of TNF-alpha serum concentration. In phobic disorders and in MWA, benzodiazepines are very often administered and, in this respect, some of them, such as diazepam, inhibit immune functions, while others, e.g., alprazolam, enhance immune responses. Alprazolam could improve clinical symptoms in MWA patients. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a disorder whose etiology and pathogenesis are still unknown. In this syndrome both abnormalities of nervous and immune systems have been reported. Despite many immune parameters evaluated in CFS no specific biomarkers of disease have been found. Our own data are in agreement with current literature in that we found decreased levels of serum (IFN)-gamma in these patients, thus indicating a predominance of T helper (h)1 response in CFS. Also leptin, a hormone which regulates food intake, fluctuates within normal ranges in CFS individuals. Quite interestingly, in depressed patients, used as controls, leptinaemia was more elevated than in CFS. Finally, in a series of recent therapeutic trials several immunomodulating agents have been used, such as staphypan Berna, lactic acid bacteria, kuibitang and intravenous immunoglobulin. In conclusion, it seems that major drug targets in stress-related disorders are immune cells in terms of inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and modulation of Th responses. In particular, according to recent evidences, antidepressants seem to exert beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune neuritis in rats by decreasing IFN- beta release or augmenting NK activity in depressed patients.", 
    "62": "A method has been developed and validated for the quantitation of midazolam, alphahydroxy-midazolam, omeprazole, and hydroxyomeprazole from one 250 microL sample of human plasma using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated for a daily working range of 0.400-100 ng/mL, with limits of detection between 2 and 15 pg/mL. The inter-assay variation was less than 15% for all analytes at four control concentrations and the samples were stable for three freeze-thaw cycles under the analysis conditions and 24 h in the post-preparative analysis matrix. This method was used to analyze samples in support of clinical studies probing the activity of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system.", 
    "63": "Agitation is commonly seen in acute schizophrenic patients and core symptoms include a wide range of symptom. It requires rapid and effective treatment approaches in order to protect patient and caregiver from potential injury. Clinician's decision of pharmacological treatment should be individualized to the needs and circumstances of the patient. Benzodiazepines, typical antipsychotics, and combinations of typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines have been widely used as treatment options. Atypical antipsychotics have clear advantages over the typical drugs as they generally show a much better safety and tolerability profile, particularly to EPS and related side effects, however clinical perception regarding efficacy in treating acutely agitated psychotic patient is controversial. New intramuscular atypical antipsychotic formulations offer evidence of being at least as effective as typical antipsychotics in controlling agitation. Therefore, they should be considered as first line therapy in agitated schizophrenic patients.", 
    "64": "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram is the active enantiomer of citalopram and has proven efficacy in the treatment of major depression, panic disorder and social phobia. Accumulating data indicate that it is also efficacious in the treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder. This drug profile summarizes the current evidence-base for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, describes the findings of a series of randomized placebo-controlled and comparator-controlled trials of escitalopram, examines the strengths and weaknesses of current treatment approaches and considers potential new therapies for the treatment of this common, chronic and impairing anxiety disorder. In summary, escitalopram is effective and well tolerated in both the short- and long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, and has advantages over benzodiazepines and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine.", 
    "65": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are constituted by three protein components, the isoquinoline binding protein (IBP), the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT). Recently, we found that high levels of PBR ligand binding in glioma cell lines correlate with in vitro tumorigenicity. To study whether enhanced PBR expression is causative or in response to cancer, we genetically modified C6 glioma cells. Antisense knockdown of the IBP resulted in more than 50% reductions in PBR ligand binding both in the mitochondrial and whole cell fractions, accompanied by similar reductions in IBP levels in these respective fractions. The IBP knockdown was accompanied by a 25% increase in cell number in confluent cultures. This correlated with an 8-fold increase in in vitro tumorigenicity, as assessed by anchorage independent growth. Cell cycle analysis indicated that knockdown of the IBP resulted in a 60% reduction in the number of cells in the pre-G1 apoptosis phase. This paralleled the reduction seen in apoptosis and cell death shown by DNA fragmentation and Trypan blue assays, respectively. Furthermore, knockdown of the IBP appeared to prevent induction of apoptosis by the antineoplastic agent, erucylphosphocholine. In addition, IBP knockdown prevented processing of the caspase 3 component of the apoptosis cascade by the erucylphosphocholine congener, erucylphospho-N,N,N-trimethylammonium. In conclusion, our results suggest that enhanced IBP expression, including enhanced PBR ligand binding, such as occurring in untreated C6 glioma cells, may provide a mechanism to increase apoptotic rates of cancer cells.", 
    "66": "In France today, the treatment of opiate and notably heroin addiction with high-dose buprenorphine (HDB) is widespread. Although this treatment has been successful to some extent, problems persist. One is that some percentage (estimated at 17-47%) of patients \"misuses\" their HDB, either by intravenous injection or inhalation. This misuse presents a public health problem, since injecting drug users are more frequently infected by hepatitis C, and may even jeopardize the treatment's efficacy.", 
    "67": "Our study compared a sample of 26 patients treated with sublingual HDB who reported injecting it on occasion and 27 patients under HDB who did not inject it.",

    "69": "Despite its efficacy, substitution treatment does not appear to provide relief for some patients. HDB injection may thus correspond to a search for a precarious balance: the disruption of the HDB kinetics induced by its injection would be aimed at enhancing the opiate effect. The consumption of other licit and illicit psychotropic agents indicates a further attempt to obtain relief from a persistent mental discomfort, over and above the substitution therapy and even its misuse. The reality of the psychological imbalance experienced with, induced by or pre-existing the heroin use requires rethinking the overall treatment. Future studies should lead to the identification of the disorders that lead these patients to seek relief in injections.",

Since therapy is not efficacious enough, their quality of life is often disturbed during the terminal stage. We retrospectively evaluated the treatment and care for 11 cases of DMD with severe CHF in our hospital. All cases had unrest and anxiety, which were successfully treated with benzodiazepines and haloperidol. In many cases, patients' families craved for patients' comfort without mental and physical pain. Nine cases resulted in death and 2 cases survived. We also sent a questionnaire to doctors of muscular dystrophy wards of 27 Japanese national hospital, inquiring about therapy protocol, monitoring system, intravenous nutrition, limitation of feeding/recreation/visitors, management of pain/anxiety/sedation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Sixty-eight doctors answered the questionnaire. Forty-seven doctors (69%) had the experience to treat DMD patients with severe CHF. The majority of them monitored electrocardiography, SpO2 and blood pressure. About a half adopted intravenous nutrition. If recovery was expected, limitation of feeding/recreation/visitors was based mainly on discussion with the patients and their families. If recovery was impossible, the limitation was decided according to their wishes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were properly used for pain, and minor and major tranquilizers for sedation. Morphine was also used. Only one doctor adopted positive CPR, while the others answered \"do not CPR\" or \"do CPR according to the wish of patients' families\". The burden to patients and their families during treatment is unavoidable but should be reduced as much as possible. Medical staffs should ask themselves about the problems to support the families as well as patients repetitively.", 
    "71": "We investigated the usefulness of quetiapine and olanzapine for delusion in nine patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Two of five patients initially treated with quetiapine showed resolution of delusion on low dose (25 mg and 50 mg/day), whereas three patients had no improvement in spite of increasing the dose to 300 mg/day. Quetiapine non-responders had a tendency to more severe delusion and dementia compared with responders. Not only all four patients initially treated but also two of three quetiapine non-responders showed a remarkable resolution of delusion on olanzapine. In particular, three of seven patients responded to an extremely low dose of 0.625 mg/day. However, severe motor debilitation was observed in one patient treated with 1.25 mg/day. Olanzapine might be useful for delusion of PD in patients not responded to quetiapine, although it should be started at a very low dosage to ameliorate worsening parkinsonism.",

The two treatment groups report highly positive attitudes toward their medication and a relatively high overall level of well-being and health-related quality of life. All patients report high levels of satisfaction with the mental health services they receive and their general health status. Olanzapine-treated patients were more likely to report reduced social and family interaction, as well as reduced sexual behavior and less participation in active recreational and pastime activities. Patients on olanzapine also reported greater difficulty in thinking clearly and more feelings of uselessness and of being lost and alone. The occurrence of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia and akathisia was low in both treatment groups.",

Future studies should expand on the findings here, building on the limitations toward a large study including a comparison group receiving long-term treatment with typical antipsychotics. Ultimately, the goal should be the incorporation of patient-oriented assessments into routine clinical practice. This is particularly important given the relationship among satisfaction with treatment, compliance, and quality of life.",

In addition, the receptor specificity of Ro64-6198 was studied, using the ORL-1 receptor antagonist, J-113397, and ORL-1 receptor knockout (KO) mice. Finally, neurological studies examined potential side effects of Ro64-6198 in the rat and mouse.",

This effect of Ro64-6198 was attenuated by J-113397 (10 mg/kg), but not the mu opioid antagonist, naltrexone (3 mg/kg). In addition, Ro64-6198 (1-3 mg/kg) reduced isolation-induced vocalizations in rat and guinea pig pups. Ro64-6198 (3 mg/kg) increased the proportion of punished responding in a mouse Geller-Seifter test in wild-type (WT) but not ORL-1 KO mice, whereas diazepam (1-5.6 mg/kg) was effective in both genotypes. In rats, Ro64-6198 reduced locomotor activity (LMA) and body temperature and impaired rotarod, beam walking, and fixed-ratio (FR) performance at doses of 10-30 mg/kg, i.e., three to ten times higher than an anxiolytic dose. In WT mice, Ro64-6198 (3-10 mg/kg) reduced LMA and rotarod performance, body temperature, and FR responding, but these same measures were unaffected in ORL-1 KO mice. Haloperidol (0.3-3 mg/kg) reduced these measures to a similar extent in both genotypes. These studies confirm the potent, ORL-1 receptor-mediated, anxiolytic-like effects of Ro64-6198, extending the findings across three species. Ro64-6198 has target-based side effects, although the magnitude of these effects varies across species.",

There was little or no variation in sensitivity amongst isolates from any one species. All Gram-negative species (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Proteus spp.) were not susceptible due to the barrier function of the outer membrane. PBD dimers showed bactericidal activity against MRSA and VRE and there was a significant post-antibiotic effect (1.5--3.5 h).

Baseline and endpoint NSS scores were evaluated by the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES). The results demonstrated that baseline total PANSS and subscale scores of positive and general symptomatology, and baseline CGI scores were significantly reduced at the end of olanzapine treatment. There were no significant differences between baseline and endpoint subscale scores of negative symptomatology.

Using 0.1 to 5 nM [3H]-DAMGO concentrations and a beta-imager, Bmax (maximal receptor density) and K(D) (the dissociation constant) were directly determined at different regions of interest (ROI) in the brains of rats treated with BPN and/or CRZ administered either once or over 21 consecutive days. Differences in Bmax and K(D) were related to both treatment and location. Acute BPN induced a down-regulation (62% mean decrease in Bmax observed on the whole brain) of mu opiate receptors. CRZ induced a mean 39% decrease in Bmax associated with substantially decreased affinity, particularly after acute administration (136% mean K(D) increase). Addition of CRZ to BPN [mean Bmax decreases of 34% (acute) and 29% (chronic)] induced significantly less down-regulation than did BPN alone, while altering affinity. These changes were maximal in the amygdaloid nucleus. Significant and persistent decreases in Bmax and affinity were also detected in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and thalamus. In the thalamus, an opposite regulation of Bmax was observed that was maximal with the combination. As the regions where changes were greatest have been specifically implicated in memory and socio-emotional functions and/or vegetative and endocrine adaptations, there is reason to suspect that the addition of CRZ to BPN may have clinical consequences. On the one hand, it may have some impact on drug abuse and misuse behaviors towards treatments including heroin substitute and BZD, and on the other, amplify the BPN effect-particularly hedonic or toxic-mainly after sporadic BPN-BZD abuses. These pharmacodynamic findings may explain, at least in part, the well-established preference of patients for the BPN-benzodiazepine combination and the toxicity with which it is associated.",

    "109": "In the current study, to understand the characteristics of dexamethasone (DEX)-treated female rats as an animal model for drug-drug interactions, a double-cannulation method was applied and separately assessed for the intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism of midazolam. Midazolam was administered intravenously or orally to the animals, and midazolam concentrations in the portal and systemic plasma were simultaneously determined. Next, the rates of elimination from the intestine and liver were estimated using the AUC values. After oral administration of midazolam, the entire drug was absorbed without intestinal first-pass metabolism, and 93% of the administered midazolam was extracted in the liver of the DEX-treated female rats. Seven per cent of the midazolam administered reached the systemic circulation. When ketoconazole was given orally to the animals, in conjunction with midazolam, the extraction ratio in the liver decreased from 93% to 77% in the control rats, and the bioavailability of midazolam increased to 23%. On the other hand, after intravenous administration, the elimination half-life of midazolam was not changed by ketoconazole pretreatment. These results indicated that midazolam is only extracted in the liver of DEX-treated female rats and that ketoconazole inhibits the hepatic first-pass metabolism, but not the systemic metabolism. In conclusion, DEX-treated female rats can be used as a drug-drug interaction model via CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition, especially for the hepatic first-pass metabolism of orally administered drugs.", 
    "110": "The newer, atypical antipsychotic drugs have improved the treatment of schizophrenia and are widely used. A disadvantage is that they increase food intake, promote weight gain and may facilitate development of diabetes. The mechanism of the latter effect is controversial. A possible interaction of these drugs with glucose transporters has been proposed: peripheral insulin resistance may develop if these drugs inhibited glucose transport in cells which express the insulin responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4, i.e., muscle and adipocytes. To test this hypothesis, we incubated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which express GLUT1 and GLUT4, with the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine for 1 or 20 h and then measured basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The doses of olanzapine tested (70 nM and 350 nM) encompass and exceed maximal steady-state concentrations of the drug in plasma of patients maintained on maximal recommended doses (20 mg QD) of olanzapine. A maximally stimulating insulin concentration (100 nM) accelerated glucose transport 10- to 15-fold in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the half-maximally stimulating insulin dose was 0.4 nM. Olanzapine (70 or 350 nM) did not affect basal or insulin-stimulated glucose transport following 1 or 20 h drug treatment at any insulin concentration tested. The data do not support the hypothesis that olanzapine at therapeutically relevant concentrations may cause peripheral insulin resistance by direct interaction with the insulin responsive glucose transport system.",

    "112": "Rats were chronically (1 week) infused with olanzapine (7.5 mg/kg) and exposed to the ABA model or ad libitum feeding. Hyperactive AN patients were followed for up to 3 months of olanzapine treatment (5 mg/kg).", 
    "113": "Olanzapine treatment reduced development of ABA in rats by reducing running wheel activity, starvation-induced hypothermia and activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Olanzapine treatment reduced activity levels of AN patients compared with untreated AN patients, without affecting body weight and plasma leptin levels.", 
    "114": "Olanzapine treatment reduced wheel running and thereby diminished development of ABA in rats. Olanzapine treatment also reduced physical activity in hyperactive AN patients in a small open-label study. These data support the need for controlled studies investigating the putative beneficial effects of olanzapine treatment in AN patients.", 
    "115": "Uncomfortable working and sleeping environments, high operational tempos, sustained operations, and insufficient staffing make fatigue a growing concern. In aviation, where a single mistake can cost millions of dollars, it is essential to optimize operator alertness. Although behavioral and administrative fatigue countermeasures should comprise the \"first line\" approach for sustaining aircrew performance, pharmacological fatigue countermeasures are often required. Various components of the U.S. military have authorized the use of specific compounds for this purpose. Hypnotics such as temazepam, zolpidem, or zaleplon can mitigate the fatigue associated with insufficient or disturbed sleep. Alertness-enhancing compounds such as caffeine, modafinil, or dextroamphetamine can temporarily bridge the gap between widely spaced sleep periods. Each of these medications has a role in sustaining the safety and effectiveness of military aircrews. The present paper provides a short overview of these compounds as well as factors to be considered before choosing one or more to help manage fatigue.", 
    "116": "To bring to the attention of the clinician the metabolic effects of most common sedatives and analgesics used in critically ill patients.", 
    "117": "Most patients admitted to the intensive care unit require sedation and analgesia to reduce anxiety, agitation, and delirium and provide pain relief. Inappropriate sedation and analgesia techniques can cause harm to the already compromised patient if they do not take into account the metabolic effect they produce.", 
    "118": "Metabolically critical illness can be divided in two phases, and acute and a prolonged one. Whereas the acute or hypermetabolic phase is characterized by elevated circulating concentration of catabolic hormones and substrate utilization to provide energy to vital organs, the prolonged or catabolic phase of critical illness is marked by reduced endocrine stimulation and severe loss of body cell mass. The most common analgesic and sedative agents used in the intensive care unit, if used in small or moderate doses, do not interfere significantly with the metabolic milieu; however, prolonged infusions, and in high doses, without adequate monitoring of level of sedation and quality of analgesia, can precipitate morbid events. Further research is needed in the metabolic aspects of analgesia and sedation in the intensive care unit, particularly if a multimodal pharmacologic strategy is used whereby multiple interventions aim at minimizing the risk of overdosing and contributing to attenuation of the stress response associated with critical illness.", 
    "119": "Mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim)-dependent Ca2+ uptake plays a central role in neurodegeneration after NMDA receptor activation. NMDA-induced DeltaPsim dissipation increases during postnatal development, coincident with increasing vulnerability to NMDA. NMDA receptor activation also produces nitric oxide (NO), which can inhibit mitochondrial respiration, dissipating DeltaPsim. Because DeltaPsim dissipation reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, we hypothesized that NO mediates the NMDA-induced DeltaPsim dissipation in immature neurons, underlying their decreased vulnerability to excitotoxicity. Using hippocampal neurons cultured from 5- and 19-d-old rats, we measured NMDA-induced changes in [Ca2+]cytosol, DeltaPsim, NO, and [Ca2+]mito. In postnatal day 5 (P5) neurons, NMDA mildly dissipated DeltaPsim in a NO synthase (NOS)-dependent manner and increased NO. The NMDA-induced NO increase was abolished with carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl-hydrazone and regulated by [Ca2+]mito. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibition prevented the NO increase, whereas inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion increased it. Consistent with this mitochondrial regulation, NOS and cytochrome oxidase immunoreactivity demonstrated mitochondrial localization of NOS. Furthermore, NOS blockade increased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during NMDA. Finally, at physiologic O2 tensions (3% O2), NMDA had little effect on survival of P5 neurons, but NOS blockade during NMDA markedly worsened survival, demonstrating marked neuroprotection by mitochondrial NO. In P19 neurons, NMDA dissipated DeltaPsim in an NO-insensitive manner. NMDA-induced NO production was not regulated by DeltaPsim, and NOS immunoreactivity was cytosolic, without mitochondrial localization. NOS blockade also protected P19 neurons from NMDA. These data demonstrate that mitochondrial NOS mediates much of the decreased vulnerability to NMDA in immature hippocampal neurons and that cytosolic NOS contributes to NMDA toxicity in mature neurons.", 
    "120": "To date, two main types of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors have been identified: one of these is the so-called central receptor which is found mainly in the cortex, limbic areas and cerebellum, and the other is known as the peripheral receptor, which is found in the kidneys, lungs, ovaries, testes, adrenal glands and blood cells, but is present also in the central nervous system (CNS), in particular in glial cells. Although for some time the peripheral BDZ receptor has been considered an acceptor site with no pharmacological activity, recent data have suggested that it may be involved in a variety of actions, such as the response to stress. The presence of these receptors in blood platelets, which are considered a reliable, peripheral mirror of the same structures located in the SNC, prompted us to evaluate them in a group of psychiatric patients after a suicide attempt, as compared with healthy control subjects, by means of the specific binding of 3H-PK 11195. Suicide, with no doubt, may be considered one of the most stressful situations occurring to humans. The results showed the presence of a significant decrease in the density of 3H-PK 11195 binding sites in the patients, as compared with healthy control subjects. This finding may represent a non-specific indicator of a condition of stress, since peripheral BDZ receptors are modulated by stress and hormones, or it may result more from an abnormal metabolism of steroid substances which could play a pivotal role in the development of vulnerability towards suicide.",

    "123": "One hundred and seven (57%) of 187 individuals answered the questionnaire: neonatologists responded more often than neurologists (chi(2) (1,187) = 7.18, P = 0.007). Phenobarbitone was used by 95% of the respondents to treat the first episode of seizures and 75% of them used an appropriate loading dose (20 mg/kg). Phenobarbitone was used by 84 and 40% of the respondents to treat the second- and third-seizure episodes, respectively. Neonatologists used phenobarbitone, phenytoin and a benzodiazepine with equal frequency to treat a third episode of seizures, whereas neurologists rarely used a benzodiazepine. Neonatologists used significantly larger total doses of phenobarbitone than neurologists. Very few respondents used pyridoxine to treat recurrent seizures that were historically linked to perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Neonatologists were more likely than neurologists to discontinue AED within a few days of seizure cessation (chi(2) (1,106) = 11.60, P = 0.0006).",

Neonatologists use phenobarbitone, phenytoin or a benzodiazepine for second and third episodes of seizures, whereas neurologists tend not to use benzodiazepines. Neonatologists use larger total doses of phenobarbitone than neurologists in pursuit of seizure control. Neonatologists discontinue AED earlier than neurologists.",

    "127": "197 patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia were allocated to olanzapine (N = 104) and FGA (N = 93). Patients taking olanzapine showed greater improvements in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative symptoms (mean difference = 2.3, 95% CI = 0.6 to 4.1) and general psychopathology (mean difference = 4.0, 95% CI = 0.8 to 7.2) sub-scales and fewer incidences of tardive dyskinesia (RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4 to 4.2, p < .0001). Olanzapine was also associated with greater improvement in a number of health-related quality-of-life outcomes on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey, including physical functioning (mean difference = 6.6, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.9), physical role limitations (mean difference = 13.7, 95% CI = 3.0 to 24.3), and emotional role limitations (mean difference = 12.1, 95% CI = 0.7 to 23.5).

    "129": "Drug analytics in oral fluid can be of relevance for various clinical and forensic questions, for example when testing for driving ability. To date few studies have been conducted concerning validity of different methods. The reliability of drug analytics in oral fluid was studied using cedia test and emit test (for cannabinoids). CUT-offs for different substances were defined after evaluation of ROC curves following various prestudies. 97 saliva and 103 urins probes from 31 opioid dependent patients were tested. Only for methadone, the results in oral fluid were comparable to those in urine. For most other drugs including opioids and barbiturates, results were less favourable. For cannabinoids and benzodiazepines, results were unsatisfactory. To date drug testing in oral fluid does not seem to be as accurate as urine analytics. Urine testing using immunoassays or gas chromatography is still the most reliable non-invasive test method. Drug testing in oral fluid may be of relevance as an additional method in substitution treatment and as an experimental tool in epidemiological road surveys.",

    "133": "Retrospectively assessed acute symptomatology was strongly increased in (S)-ketamine subjects in terms of dissociation, reexperiencing, and avoidance, and slightly heightened in racemic ketamines. Current PTSD symptoms were substantially elevated in (S)-ketamine subjects, while there was no difference observed between opioids and racemic ketamines. Medication groups did not differ in regard to demographic variables, previous or postaccidental traumatic events, time between accident and investigation, and injury severity.",

    "135": "In a new approach to the interpretation of data from flexible-dose studies, we examined the safety and efficacy measurements that preceded and followed dose changes, to identify clinical factors that predict dose change as well as subsequent outcome of clinical status with dose change. This was a post hoc analysis of 3 flexible-dosed olanzapine studies: acutely ill bipolar I patients with an index manic episode (N = 452) who received olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) or haloperidol (3-15 mg/d); acutely ill patients with schizophrenia (N = 339) who received olanzapine (10-20 mg/d) or risperidone (4-12 mg/d) for 28 weeks; and remitted bipolar I patients (N = 361) who received olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) or placebo for 48 weeks. The major findings of this analysis were: an increase in dose was predicted by baseline illness severity in the acute studies, and a decrease in dose was predicted by illness symptom improvement or worsening of adverse events. Dose decrease was followed by significantly decreased efficacy for patients with acute mania treated with olanzapine or haloperidol, and olanzapine dose increases were followed by improved efficacy. Treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptom adverse events and akathisia typically predicted dose decreases. Techniques used in this analysis may prove to be useful in assessing the relationship between dose change and safety and efficacy measures.", 
    "136": "Neurologic soft signs (NSS) are considered a somatic feature associated with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) that are present in neuroleptic-treated, as well as untreated or first-episode patients. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of NSS in groups of schizophrenic patients treated with either a conventional neuroleptic medication, haloperidol (n = 37), or atypical antipsychotic medications, risperidone (n = 19), clozapine (n = 34), and olanzapine (n = 18). NSS were assessed with the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES), whereas extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur more commonly with conventional neuroleptic treatment, were evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Scale. NES scores were not significantly different between groups. Slight differences were found for 2 items only. The haloperidol group showed higher scores for the \"Romberg test,\" whereas the clozapine group showed higher scores for \"short-term memory.\" There were significant correlations between EPS and NES total score in the haloperidol and risperidone groups. These results demonstrate an overall overlapping of NSS among the groups, confirming their substantial independence from neurologic implications of neuroleptic treatment.", 
    "137": "To predict drug interactions with estazolam, the biotransformation of estazolam to its major hydoxylated metabolite, 4-hydroxyestazolam was studied in vitro using pooled human liver microsomes and individual expressed human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Estazolam was metabolized to 4-hydroxyestazolam according to the Hill kinetic model in pooled human liver microsomes. The Km value for the 4-hydroxylation of estazolam was 24.1 microM, and the Vmax value was 52.6 pmol min(-1)mg(-1) protein. The formation of 4-hydroxyestazolam from estazolam in pooled human liver microsomes was significantly inhibited by itraconazole and erythromycin, specific CYP3A4 inhibitors, in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 1.1 and 12.8 microM, respectively. When estazolam was incubated with expressed human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4), it was metabolized only by CYP3A4. In conclusion, the biotransformation of estazolam to 4-hydroxyestazolam was catalyzed by CYP3A4.", 
    "138": "End-product inhibition was explored as a mechanism for the lower clearance determination obtained from microsomes compared with hepatocytes. Triazolam, diazepam and phenytoin microsomal substrate depletion was reduced by 23, 34 and 39%, respectively, when incubated with their primary metabolites. Ki values of 28+/-6 and 11+/-1 microM were obtained when 4'-hydroxydiazepam and p-hydroxyphenytoin where incubated with diazepam and phenytoin, respectively. Alamethicin (a glucuronidation activator) was unsuccessful in alleviating these effects. IC50 values of 17, 32 and 18 microM for phenytoin and 83, 110 and 97 microM for diazepam were observed with salicylamide- (a glucuronidation inhibitor) treated hepatocytes, control hepatocytes and microsomes, respectively, when incubated with their primary metabolites. These differences suggest that metabolite concentrations in the vicinity of the enzyme are lower in hepatocytes compared with microsomes, reducing the likelihood of end-product inhibition in the former system. In conclusion, end-product inhibition may be more prominent in microsomes (in particular for substrate depletion assays where metabolism tends to be more extensive); results suggest that this phenomenon may contribute to the observed variations in metabolism characteristics and intrinsic clearance (CLint) between hepatocytes and microsomes.", 
    "139": "New antipsychotic drugs often increase weight and produce metabolic disturbances in treated patients. However, the mechanisms by which neuroleptics induce these undesirable side effects in humans are not known. Studies have shown that antipsychotics can increase body weight in female but not in male rats. However, no studies investigated changes in macronutrient selection during chronic treatments with antipsychotics in male rats, and no studies investigated precisely body composition after such treatments. In the present work, we studied in male rats the effects of long-term administration of two neuroleptics: haloperidol, a classical neuroleptic which has a moderate effect on weight gain in humans, and olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic which has a more important effect on weight gain. Treatments (both 1 mg/kg) were given orally for 6 weeks, and the animals were allowed to self-select food among carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Food selection was measured throughout the study, and body composition was measured by dissection and weighing of the main organs and tissues. Circulating leptin, insulin and glucose were also assayed at the end of the study on blood collected at the time of carcass analysis. The results show that none of the neuroleptic treatments modified caloric intake, food selection, body weight, and body composition. Olanzapine produced a statistically non-significant increase in subcutaneous fat tissue. It is concluded that a 6-week olanzapine or haloperidol treatment in male rats under dietary macronutrient selection does not significantly affect energy regulation.", 
    "140": "The search for flavonoids with novel therapeutic effects has been intense. Wogonin, as a naturally existing monoflavonoid, has been shown to have therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo. Methods for its extraction from herbs and its chemical synthesis have been developed. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown a rapid tissue distribution and prolonged plasma elimination phase of wogonin. It has been shown experimentally that wogonin exerts anti-oxidant activity, which may, in part, underlie its antiinflammatory, anti-cancer, antiviral and neuroprotective actions. The recent discovery of its anxiolytic activity suggests a new mechanism of action, involving interaction with the benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site of the GABA(A) receptor and modulation of this receptor activity. Although the safety record of wogonin is remarkable and voluminous literature about its pharmacological effects is available, it has not been used in Western medicine in the form of a pure chemical. In this article we review its therapeutic effects, its sources and pharmacokinetic profile to highlight its therapeutic potential.",

Now, an innovative study offers compelling evidence that even implicit memory can be impaired during amnesia, temporarily induced in healthy subjects using a neuropharmacological manipulation (midazolam). Importantly, midazolam impaired implicit, relational memory, whereas non-relational memory was preserved, supporting the characterization of conscious memory in terms of relational encoding.",

The sample preparation was a liquid-liquid extraction with tuloene yielding almost near 100% recoveries of two compounds. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a Chromolith Performance RP-18e 100 mm x 4.6mm column, using a mixture of a phosphate buffer (pH 3.5; 10mM)-acetonitrile (70:30, v/v), in isocratic mode at 2 ml/min at a detection wave-length of 228 nm. The calibration curves were linear (r(2)>0.998) in the concentration range of 5-450 ng ml(-1). The lower limit of quantification was 5 ng ml(-1) for two compounds studied. The within- and between-day precisions in the measurement of QC samples at four tested concentrations were in the range of 0.89-9.1% and 2.1-10.1% R.S.D., respectively.

The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has extensive neural connections in mesolimbic regions that appear to modulate dopamine. The current study evaluated the effects of GABA(B) receptor agonists baclofen and CGP44532, the benzodiazepine agonist alprazolam, and the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine on lever responding maintained by low dose cocaine injections (0.032 mg/kg) or by food pellet (1 g) delivery in baboons. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was tested as a negative control. Cocaine or food was available under a fixed ratio (FR 10) schedule of reinforcement during daily 2-h sessions. During baseline conditions, cocaine and pellets maintained similar numbers of reinforcers per session. Baclofen, CGP44532 and tiagabine dose-dependently reduced the number of cocaine injections, where as the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil did not. Baclofen, CGP44532 and tiagabine also produced dose-related decreases in food-maintained behavior. In contrast, the benzodiazepine agonist alprazolam, which positively modulates GABA(A) receptors via the benzodiazepine site, produced decreases in cocaine self-injection, but not food-maintained behavior. Thus, the effects of alprazolam were specific for cocaine-maintained behavior, where as the effects of baclofen and CGP44532 were not.", 
    "148": "In our previous studies, we have demonstrated the anxiolytic effects of angelica essential oil in three anxiety models using mice. This study aimed to characterize the similar behavior effects of angelica essential oil in the social interaction test of anxiety and the hole-board test of exploration and locomotor activity in rats. These results indicate that angelica essential oil possessed a wide range of anxiolytic properties. In the social interaction test, angelica essential oil decreased aggressive behaviors at the doses of 21 and 42 mg/kg, while the doses of 21 and 42 mg/kg significantly increased social interaction time of the high light, unfamiliar test condition and 21 mg/kg could also prolong social interaction time of the high light, familiar test condition. In the hole-board test, angelica essential oil at 10.5 mg/kg significantly increased head-dipping counts and duration. Thus, our findings suggest the potential usefulness of angelica essential oil against various types of anxiety-related disorders and social failure.", 
    "149": "Nerve agent poisoning is known to induce full-blown seizures, seizure-related brain damage (SRBD), and lethality. Effective and quick management of these seizures is critical. In conditions of delayed treatment, presently available measures are inadequate calling for optimization of therapeutic approaches. The effects of ketamine/atropine sulfate (KET/AS) combinations were thus assessed as potential valuable delayed therapy in soman-poisoned male guinea pigs. Animals received pyridostigmine (26 microg/kg, i.m.) 30 min before soman (62 microg/kg, i.m.) followed by therapy consisting of atropine methyl nitrate (4 mg/kg) 1 min later. KET was then administered i.m. at different times after the onset of seizures, starting at 30 min post-poisoning. KET was always injected with atropine sulfate, itself given at a dose that was unable to modify seizures (2 to 10 mg/kg). Different treatment schemes (dose and time of injection) were evaluated. Sub-anesthetic doses of KET (10 mg/kg) could prevent lethality and stop ongoing seizures only when administered 30 min after challenge. An extended delay before treatment (up to 2 h) called for an increase in KET dose (up to 60 mg/kg three times), thus reaching anesthetic levels but without the need of any ventilation support. KET proved effective in stopping seizures, highly reducing SRBD and allowing survival with a progressive loss of efficacy when treatment was delayed beyond 1 h post-challenge. Preliminary results suggest that association with the benzodiazepine midazolam (1 mg/kg) might be interesting when treatment is initiated 2 h after poisoning, i.e., when KET efficacy is dramatically reduced. All in all, these observations suggest that KET, in association with atropine sulfate and possibly other drugs, may be highly effective in the delayed treatment of severe soman intoxication.", 
    "150": "Tramadol is a mu opioid agonist that also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Because non-medical use of prescription opioids, including tramadol, has increased in the U.S. over the last several years, we sought to profile its subjective, psychomotor, and physiological effects in recreational drug users. Twenty-two subjects received placebo, 50 or 100 mg tramadol, morphine, or 2 mg lorazepam in a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. The last 12 subjects in the study received 25 mg morphine, a dose that is putatively equianalgesic to 100 mg tramadol. In these subjects, morphine induced miosis and several other mu agonist subjective effects; 100 mg tramadol increased \"feel drug effect\" and drug liking ratings, and decreased pupil size, but the miotic effect was not statistically significant. Lorazepam, but neither tramadol nor morphine, impaired psychomotor performance. When the placebo, tramadol, and lorazepam data from all 22 subjects were analyzed, 100 mg tramadol induced miosis, and several subjective effects were increased significantly, including ratings of drug liking and \"want to take again.\" The present results indicating that a clinically-prescribed dose of oral tramadol has abuse liability-related effects in recreational drug users suggest the need for further abuse liability testing of the oral formulation in opioid abusers.", 
    "151": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an unremitting, advancing disease of central nervous system white matter. PML is caused by infection of the JC polyoma virus, most always in patients with immunosupression due to, for example, cancer, anti-rejection transplant medications or HIV. There is no specific treatment or cure for PML, and untreated it has a median life expectancy is less than four months. Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has greatly reduced the incidence and prevalence of PML in HIV+ patients likely, however, even in the best case scenario of an HIV+ patient with PML and taking HAART, a significant mortality remains. Novel treatments for PML are needed. Recently Atwood and colleagues have found that the cellular receptor for JC virus is the serotonin 5HT2A receptor. In vitro they used the older antipsychotic medications chlorpromazine and clozapine to block the serotonin 5HT2A receptor and block JC virus cell entry. Unfortunately, however, chlorpromazine and clozapine have such significant side effects and toxicities, e.g., extrapyramidal symptoms and the possibility of bone marrow dyscrasias - that they may be problematic to use clinically. Here, we point out that some newer atypical antipsychotics such as zisprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine--medicines with much better side effect and toxicity profiles than the older antipsychotics--in vitro are significantly more potent 5HT2A receptor antagonists than chlorpromazine or clozapine by in some cases more than a factor of 10, and thus may be useful as treatment for or prophylaxis against PML.",

The age ranged from less than 1 to 70 years, with the highest incidence in the range of 14-40 years, with males (57%) outnumbering females (43%). The most common mode of poisoning was suicidal (53%), followed by accidental (47%). The route of exposure was mainly oral (88%). Dermal (5%), inhalation and ocular exposure contributed 7% to the total. The highest incidence of poisoning was due to household agents (44.1%) followed by drugs (18.8%), agricultural pesticides (12.8%), industrial chemicals (8.9%), animals bites and stings (4.7%), plants (1.7%), unknown (2.9%) and miscellaneous groups (5.6%). Household products mainly comprised of pyrethroids, rodenticides, carbamates, phenyl, detergents, corrosives etc. Drugs implicated included benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, analgesics, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, thyroid hormones and oral contraceptives. Among the agricultural pesticides, aluminium phosphide was the most commonly consumed followed by organochlorines, organophosphates, ethylene dibromide, herbicides and fungicides. Copper sulphate and nitrobenzene were common among industrial chemicals. The bites and stings group comprised of snake bites, scorpion, wasp and bee stings. Poisoning due to plants was low, but datura was the most commonly ingested. An alarming feature of the study was the high incidence of poisoning in children (36.5%). The age ranged from less than 1 to 18 years and the most vulnerable age group included children from less than 1 year to 6 years. Accidental mode was the most common (79.7%). Intentional attempts were also noticed (20.2%) in the age group above 12 years. The present data may not give an exact picture of the incidence of poisoning in India, but represents a trend in our country. The Poisons Information Centre plays a vital role in providing timely management guidelines including the supply of necessary antidotes from the recently established National Antidote Bank, thereby helping to save precious lives.", 
    "158": "Pirenzepine was considered as a pharmacologic agent of preventing form-deprivation myopia. To assess the ocular bioavailability of pirenzepine, a HPLC method for determination of pirenzepine in rabbit aqueous humor was developed. An HPLC system was used in the reverse phase mode for the determination of pirenzepine. A Luna RP18 5 microm 4.6 mm x 150 mm column was employed at 35 degrees C. The mobile phase was methanol/0.02 M KH2PO4/sodium 1-pentanesulfonate (350/650/1, v/v/m, pH was adjusted to 8.0 by dropping 1M NaOH). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Pirenzepine was monitored at 280 nm. Sample treatment procedure consists of deproteinisation with methanol. Calibration curves fitted by plotting the peak area versus concentration were linear in the range 20-400 ng/ml. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of present method was 20 ng/ml. Within-day and inter-day coefficient of variation was lower than 10%. Analytical recoveries were determined as 92.4, 95.4 and 101.4% at concentrations of 40, 200 and 400 ng/ml. In conclusion, this HPLC method using a simple sample treatment procedure appears suitable for monitoring ocular concentration of pirenzepine.", 
    "159": "The presence in Paramecium of gamma-aminobutyric acid A-type receptors (GABA(A)) and the capability of the protozoon to synthesize and release the GABA neurotransmitter into the environment have already been demonstrated. This study investigates the involvement of the GABA(A) complex in the swimming control of the ciliated protozoon. The GABA(A) receptors were pharmacologically activated by the selective agonist muscimol and the effect on Paramecium primaurelia swimming behavior was analyzed. Paramecium normally swims forward, but the activation of GABA(A) receptors induced a peculiar response, characterized by alternate periods of whirling and forward swim. This effect was inhibited by the GABA(A) selective antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the application of benzodiazepines did not enhance the agonist action but only reduced it. Response to muscimol was also suppressed by nimodipine, a selective antagonist of dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. This inhibition suggests that an inflow of calcium ions through L-type channels mediates the muscimol-induced swimming behavior.", 
    "160": "This study was performed to investigate the anxiolytic-like effects of red ginseng (RG, steamed raw ginseng at 98-100 degrees C) and sun ginseng (SG, heat-processed ginseng at higher temperature) in mice using the elevated plus-maze model. Furthermore, the anxiolytic-like effects of RG and SG were compared to a known active anxiolytic drug (diazepam). The RG butanol fraction (100 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of open arms entries and the time spent on the open arm (indicators of anxiolytic-like effects) compared with that of the saline group. However, lower doses of the SG total extract (50 mg/kg) and the SG butanol fraction (25 and 50 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of open arms entries and the time spent on the open arms. The RG total extract (100 mg/kg) and the SG total extract at a lower dose (25 mg/kg) did not increase the number of open arm entries or the time spent on the open arm. On the other hand, the RG butanol fraction (100 mg/kg), the SG total extract (50 mg/kg), and the SG butanol fraction (50 mg/kg) decreased locomotor activity in a manner similar to diazepam. These data indicate that ginseng has anxiolytic-like effects, and the anxiolytic potential of SG is stronger than that of RG in the elevated plus-maze model. Ginseng saponins have been suggested to play an important role in the anxiolytic effects of ginseng. We provide evidence that ginseng may be useful for the treatment of anxiety.", 
    "161": "It has been reported that novelty may evoke both an exploratory and a fear drive, thus generating behavior responding to an approach/avoidance conflict. However, not much is known about the approach component. Whereas there exists abundant evidence referring to the avoidance component as the main target for the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines, the involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in fear and anxiety is controversial. The present study examined the effects of the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine, the D(2) dopaminergic antagonist sulpiride and the combined treatment sulpiride plus apomorphine on conventional and non-conventional measures of the behavior of rats exposed to an elevated plus-maze. Systemic injection of apomorphine (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) caused a selective increase in the time spent in the open arms and in the open arm extremities. Pre-treatment with sulpiride blocked these effects while this dopaminergic antagonist had no effect by its own. Apomorphine produced no significant effects on stretching, flat-back-approach or scanning. Therefore, apomorphine increased the behavioral response linked to the approach component of the conflict without affecting risk assessment behaviors. These findings suggest that dopaminergic mechanisms, probably through D(2) receptors, may also be involved in the mediation of the conflict derived from the need of gathering information for confirming, identifying and localizing danger and take the appropriate action for avoiding the threatening stimuli of the elevated plus-maze. A role for dopaminergic mechanisms in the setting up of adaptive responses in a fear-inducing environment is discussed.", 
    "162": "A relationship between cell metabolism and the expression of glucose transporters (GLUT) has been reported. On the other side, treatment with some antipsychotics has been associated with an increased incidence of hyperglycemia and new-onset type 2 diabetes. We here examined the effects of different concentrations of the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol (400 and 800 microg/ml), of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine (100 and 200 microg/ml) and olanzapine (100 and 200 microg/ml) as well as of the antidepressant mirtazapine (10(-7) mol) on the mRNA levels of GLUT1-5 in the human leukemic blood cell line U937 after incubation for 48 h. After experimental treatment, significant increases were detected by ANOVA and appropriate post-hoc tests for mirtazapine in GLUT4 mRNA levels as well as for haloperidol 400 and 800 microg/ml, olanzapine 200 microg/ml, and mirtazapine in GLUT5 mRNA levels. ANOVAs revealed no statistically significant changes in GLUT1-3 and beta-actin mRNA levels. These findings suggest that direct effects of psychotropic drugs on cellular GLUT4 and GLUT5 may be involved in the metabolic dysfunctions occurring during psychopharmacological treatment.", 
    "163": "Falls are common at all ages and especially in the elderly; it is important to understand contributing causes. Over a 1-year period we studied blood alcohol (BAC) and benzodiazepine concentrations in patients attending an emergency department because of a fall. The 22% of 615 patients tested were positive for alcohol, 55% were positive for benzodiazepines (BZD) and 1.5% were positive for both substances. A significantly larger proportion of males tested positive for alcohol (40.2%) than females (7.6%). Both in males and females the percentage as well as the extent of blood alcohol levels decreased significantly with age. Benzodiazepines were also consumed more frequently in males (8.5%) than in females (3.2%, p=0.007). Concerning BAC there was no difference between males (1.75+/-0.81 g/l) and females (1.66+/-0.91 g/l). In patients older than 70 years the BAC (1.30+/-0.80 g/l) was lower in comparison to younger ones. All blood samples positive for benzodiazepines could be traced back to diazepam consumption. We found a high number of young and middle aged patients using alcohol (males=49.7%; females=18.9%) and a lower but still relevant number of benzodiazepine users (males=9.5%; females=2.4%). In addition, this study shows that alcohol plays a more important role in patients up to 70 years in fall-related accidents when compared to accidents of other causes.",

    "182": "Changes in gonadal steroid hormone levels during the menstrual cycle affect seizure frequency in women with catamenial epilepsy. Since GABA(A) receptors (GABARs) contribute to the prevention and termination of seizures by reducing neuronal excitability, we hypothesized that fluctuating gonadal steroid levels might affect GABAR subunit expression, which could alter inhibitory tone leading to increased seizure activity. To address this question in a simplified environment in vitro, we examined the effects of gonadal steroids on NT2-N neuronal cells. We have previously shown that NT2-N cells express functional GABARs, and that the expression pattern of GABAR subunits is regulated by chronic benzodiazepine exposure and hypoxia. NT2-N neurons were exposed to progesterone (0.1 microM), beta-estradiol (3 nM), or vehicle (DMSO) for 2 days or 7 days prior to RNA harvesting. GABAR subunit mRNA levels were assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR normalized to actin levels. Progesterone exposure for 7 days increased alpha2 and gamma3 and decreased alpha5 subunit mRNAs, while beta-estradiol caused significant increases in alpha3, beta3 and epsilon expression. Further analysis revealed differential regulation of alpha4, alpha5, epsilon and pi subunit expression. Plots of relative PCR density in progesterone-treated cells for alpha2 vs. alpha5, alpha5 vs. gamma3 and alpha2 vs. gamma3 showed correlation between samples, suggesting coordinate regulation. Both progesterone and estrogen nuclear receptor mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR, and 2 days but not 7 days estrogen exposure upregulated progesterone receptor mRNA. Gonadal steroid fluctuations regulate GABA(A) receptor subunit expression in NT2-N cells. Such changes, if observed in vivo, could affect seizure frequency.",

    "190": "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disease of severe progressive muscle stiffness in the spine and lower extremities with superimposed muscle spasms triggered by external stimuli. Patients with SPS are often referred for psychiatric evaluation and the psychiatrist may be the first to diagnosis SPS. Psychosocial stressors often precede the first manifestations of the disease; depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse are comorbid illnesses. The identification of an association with antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) was invaluable for definitively establishing a pathological basis for the disease; antibodies to amphiphysin and gephyrin are also found in cases of SPS but at much lower frequencies. Whether the antibodies inhibit GAD activity in vivo, target GAD-expressing neurons for immune-mediated destruction, are part of a wider immune process, or are merely a marker for destruction of GAD-expressing neurons by an independent neurodegenerative process is not yet clear. Both electromyography and the detection of GAD antibodies are useful in establishing a diagnosis of SPS. Treatment of SPS includes the use of immunomodulating therapies (plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulins) and symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines and baclofen. The use of tricyclic antidepressants and rapid withdrawal from therapy should be avoided.", 
    "191": "During her first pregnancy, a 37-year-old woman with idiopathic generalised epilepsy that was adequately controlled with lamotrigine experienced a series of epileptic seizures following an elective caesarean section. The attacks were terminated with diazepam. The following day, she developed EEG-confirmed status epilepticus, for which midazolam was administered intravenously. No further attacks were observed and the patient was later discharged in good condition with a healthy newborn son. She remained on lamotrigine therapy. At the end of her second pregnancy, the patient again experienced tonic-clonic seizures. The dosage of lamotrigine was increased and the patient received clonazepam intravenously, but a new seizure quickly occurred. Following an emergency caesarean section with midazolam treatment, a healthy daughter was born. No further attacks were observed. This case history illustrates the occurrence of adult idiopathic generalised epilepsy and highlights the problems that can arise late in pregnancy and during childbirth.", 
    "192": "Recently, it was reported that anesthetizing infant rats for 6 h with a combination of anesthetic drugs (midazolam, nitrous oxide, isoflurane) caused widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain, followed by lifelong cognitive deficits. It has also been reported that ketamine triggers neuroapoptosis in the infant rat brain if administered repeatedly over a period of 9 h. The question arises whether less extreme exposure to anesthetic drugs can also trigger neuroapoptosis in the developing brain. To address this question we administered ketamine, midazolam or ketamine plus midazolam subcutaneously at various doses to infant mice and evaluated the rate of neuroapoptosis in various brain regions following either saline or these various drug treatments. Each drug was administered as a single one-time injection in a dose range that would be considered subanesthetic, and the brains were evaluated by unbiased stereology methods 5 h following drug treatment. Neuroapoptosis was detected by immunohistochemical staining for activated caspase-3. It was found that either ketamine or midazolam caused a dose-dependent, statistically significant increase in the rate of neuroapoptosis, and the two drugs combined caused a greater increase than either drug alone. The apoptotic nature of the neurodegenerative reaction was confirmed by electron microscopy. We conclude that relatively mild exposure to ketamine, midazolam or a combination of these drugs can trigger apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing mouse brain.", 
    "193": "Cognitive and neuropsychiatric (BPSD) symptoms seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) probably result from differential neurotransmitter alterations. The involvement of the glutamatergic and GABAergic system in cognitive and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) has been studied in post-mortem frontal and temporal cortex from AD patients who had been prospectively assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive impairment and with the Present Behavioral Examination (PBE) for BPSD. In addition to cholinergic deficits, significant decreases in gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) content, with no changes in glutamate content, were found in frontal and temporal cortex. Both GABA levels and the glutamate/GABA ratio showed significant correlations with depression in AD. In the temporal cortex, higher densities of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors also correlated with more severe depression. It can be suggested that in a situation of cholinergic deficit, such as AD, an imbalance between the excitatory glutamatergic tone and inhibitory GABAergic tone may be responsible for non-cognitive behavioral disturbances.", 
    "194": "The main inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the brain, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, is the target for many clinically used drugs to treat, for example, anxiety disorders and epilepsy and to induce sedation and anesthesia. These drugs facilitate the function of pentameric A-type GABA (GABA(A)) receptors that are extremely widespread in the brain and composed from the repertoire of 19 subunit variants. Modern genetic studies have found associations of various subunit gene polymorphisms with neuropsychiatric disorders, including alcoholism, schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar affective disorder, but these studies are still at their early phase because they still have failed to lead to validated drug development targets. Recent neurobiological studies on new animal models and receptor subunit mutations have revealed novel aspects of the GABA(A) receptors, which might allow selective targeting of the drug action in receptor subtype-selective fashion, either on the synaptic or extrasynaptic receptor populations. More precisely, the greatest advances have occurred in the clarification of the molecular and behavioral mechanisms of action of the GABA(A) receptor agonists already in the clinical use, such as benzodiazepines and anesthetics, rather than in the introduction of novel compounds to clinical practice. It is likely that these new developments will help to overcome the present problems of the chronic treatment with nonselective GABA(A) agonists, that is, the development of tolerance and dependence, and to focus the drug action on the neurobiologically and neuropathologically relevant substrates.", 
    "195": "L-655,708 is an imidazobenzodiazepine possessing 30-70-fold selectivity for the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors containing an alpha5 rather than alpha1, alpha2 or alpha3 subunit. In the present study, [(3)H]L-655,708 was used to label mouse brain benzodiazepine binding sites in vivo. When compared to inhibition of in vivo binding of the non-selective ligand [(3)H]Ro 15-1788, the pharmacology of mouse in vivo [(3)H]L-655,708 binding was consistent with selective in vivo labelling of alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Thus, diazepam was equipotent at inhibiting in vivo [(3)H]L-655,708 and [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding; zolpidem, which has very low affinity for alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors, gave no inhibition of in vivo [(3)H]L-655,708 binding despite inhibiting in vivo [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding; and L-655,708 was more potent at inhibiting the in vivo binding of [(3)H]L-655,708 compared to [(3)H]Ro 15-1788. This pharmacological specificity of in vivo [(3)H]L-655,708 binding was confirmed autoradiographically. Hence, the anatomical distribution of in vivo [(3)H]L-655,708 binding was comparable to the distribution of alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors identified in vitro. Moreover, this distribution was distinct from that identified using [(3)H]Ro 15-1788. These data therefore suggest that [(3)H]L-655,708 can be used to identify alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors in vivo and that this ligand can be used to measure receptor occupancy of alpha5-selective ligands.",

These patients were treated with the following regimen; each subsequent step was taken if clinical evidence of epileptic activity persisted: midazolam 0.5 mg/kg rectally or 0.1 mg/kg intravenously. After 10 minutes: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg intravenously. After 10 minutes: phenytoin 20 mg/kg intravenously in 20 minutes.

Phenobarbital 20 mg/kg intravenously or pentobarbital 2 to 5 mg/kg intravenous load, 1 to 2 mg/kg/hour continuously intravenously. Patients who received initial rectal diazepam were included. Patients were categorized according to the cause of generalized convulsive status epilepticus. These categories were then related to the level of antiepileptic therapy needed. Patients' ages ranged from 0.5 to 197.4 months. The cause of generalized convulsive status epilepticus was idiopathic or febrile convulsions in two thirds of cases. Most (89%) patients were managed on midazolam and phenytoin. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus was terminated with midazolam alone in 58 patients, with the addition of phenytoin in 19 patients and with continuous midazolam in 32 patients. Thirteen patients needed additional barbiturates. The relationship between the level of antiepileptic therapy and etiology was not significant. Fifty-two patients needed artificial ventilation. Seven patients died; no deaths were directly attributable to generalized convulsive status epilepticus itself. With the use of the proposed protocol, combining midazolam and phenytoin, 89% of the cases of generalized convulsive status epilepticus could be successfully managed.",

To this end, much research has been expended on trying to identify and develop drug probes that accurately predict the metabolism of CYP3A substrates in individuals. Recently, Benet has written on the futility of such an enterprise; however, other researchers believe the identification of valuable predictive probes is not only possible but crucial.", 
    "202": "SJG-136 (NSC 694501), 8,8'-[[(propane-1,3-diyl)dioxy]bis[(11aS)-7-methoxy-2-methylidene-1,2,3,11a-tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepin-5-one], which is being developed as a DNA-interactive antitumor agent, contains highly reactive imines in the diazepinone portions of the molecule. Water or alcohol adds readily to the imino moiety to form the corresponding carbinolamine or its alkyl ether, respectively. This sensitivity to protic substances poses a formidable challenge to the formulation and HPLC assay development for the compound. After studying the solution chemistry of SJG-136 and its potential interaction with various stationary phases, two reversed-phase liquid chromatographic assays for the compound have been developed. A direct assay that separates SJG-136 from its water or methanol adducts and an indirect assay that quantifies SJG-136 as its dihydrate adduct are reported. The latter method, which is more practical for drug development, has been validated. It is reproducible (R.S.D.<2%), linear (r2=0.9999) and accurate (within 98-102% recovery), with a lower detection limit of 2.5 ng.", 
    "203": "The anxiolytic and sedative effects of hydroalcoholic extract (HE) of Salvia reuterana Boiss. was evaluated in mice. The HE of Salvia reuterana (100 mg/kg), increased the percentage of time-spent and the percentage of arm entries in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. Spontaneous locomotor activity count measured in 15 min of the test was significantly decreased in animals pretreated with diazepam and 100 mg/kg of Salvia reuterana extract. Results of the present study provide support for the traditional usage of Salvia reuterana as a sedative and anxiolytic medicinal plant.", 
    "204": "The hot plate test is a standard way to measure nociceptive response latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus. Here we have modified the classic hot plate by allowing animals to escape to an adjacent chamber after exposure to the heated surface. In this test, the animals escape to the adjacent chamber after exposure to the hot plate set at 50 degrees C. Repeated exposure to the hot plate resulted in a facilitation of escape responses, as measured by a reduced latency to escape from the noxious thermal stimulus. Signs of nociceptive behavior, such as licking or jumping, were not affected in animals that received hot plate training. The reduction of escape latencies after repeated hot plate exposure might be a useful measure for studying the facilitation of escape responses. In addition, the modified hot plate described here might be useful in studying performance and memory deficits related to noxious thermal stimuli.",

    "206": "The present report describes a rapid, selective and a highly sensitive assay for midazolam (MDZ) and its major metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam (1-OH-MDZ) in human plasma employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) detection. The method involves liquid-liquid extraction sample clean-up, separation on a Purospher RP 18-e column and detection with an electrospray interface in the positive ion mode. The overall recoveries were about 100% and 80% for midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam, respectively. Accuracy, precision and linearity were acceptable for biological samples with quantitation limits of 0.1-100 ng mL(-1) plasma for both analytes. The validated method was successfully applied to quantify plasma concentration of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam in authentic samples from a healthy volunteer following a single 15 mg oral dose of midazolam (apparent total clearance: 3.47 L h(-1)kg(-1) and AUC(0-alpha)IOH-MDZ/MDZ: 0.338)."
