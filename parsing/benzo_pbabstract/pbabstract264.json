    "1": "There is increasing evidence of the potential therapeutic utility of glutamate receptor antagonists in the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders, including stroke and epilepsy. In the last few years noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists have received considerable attention due to their therapeutic potentiality. The discovery of GYKI 52466, the prototype of noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists endowed with anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties, induced growing interest on 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives. This review covers the chemistry and pharmacology of this important class of AMPA receptor antagonists.", 
    "2": "Ras genes encode proteins that activate in an intracellular signaling network controlling differentiation, proliferation and cell survival. Mutated Ras oncogenes encoding proteins that are constitutively active can induce malignancies in a variety of laboratory models. In human malignancies, Ras mutations are common, having been identified in approximately 30% of cancers. Given the importance of Ras and downstream targets Raf and MEK in the development of malignancies and their frequent expression in human cancers, it is not surprising that a variety of agents disrupting signaling through Ras and downstream proteins are under development. These agents can be broadly classified structurally as small molecules and anti-sense oligonucleotides. They can be characterized functionally as those inhibiting Ras protein expression such as the oligodeoxynucleotide ISIS 2503, those inhibiting Ras processing, in particular the farnesyl transferase inhibitors R115777, SCH 66336 and BMS 214662, and those inhibiting downstream effectors Raf, such as ISIS 5132 and MEK, which is inhibited by CI-1040. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in the development of these agents.", 
    "3": "Dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are thought to play an important role in fear motivation. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the connection between DA D2, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A, and benzodiazepine receptors in the VTA and footshock-associated emotionality. Microinfusion of the DA D2 receptor agonist quinpirole. the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, and the benzodiazepine receptor agonist flurazepam into the VTA was observed to suppress the shock enhancement of acoustic startle amplitudes. None of the drugs depressed baseline startle responding or footshock reactivity. The results indicate the involvement of VTA DA neurons in the fear-arousing properties of footshock and implicate the VTA as a possible neural site for the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines.",

We used olanzapine, 5-20 mg/day, to treat severe aggression in six non-psychotic teenage boys with neuropsychiatric disorders. All but one started to respond within one week. The therapeutic effect in four of the patients clearly outweighed the side effects (weight gain and sedation). The subjects described a markedly increased sense of well being during the olanzapine treatment.",

    "6": "The aim of the present study was to compare the possible dependence potential of antidepressants (ADs) to benzodiazepines (BZDs). The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), the Benzodiazepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ) and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) were administered to 70 psychiatric outpatient BZD users and 54 psychiatric outpatient AD users. Significantly more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition Revised (DSM-III-R) as well as International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) past year (PY) and lifetime (LT) dependence diagnoses were made in the BZD group than in the AD group. Bendep-SRQ scale scores for Problematic Use, Preoccupation and Lack of Compliance were significantly higher in the BZD group than in the AD group. The BZD group also had a higher rating on the Withdrawal scale, but this difference was not statistically significant. According to DSM-III-R and ICD-10 criteria ADs do have some dependence liability in psychiatric outpatients, but clearly to a lesser extent than BZDs. Further research is needed to differentiate the dependence potential among the various classes of ADs.", 
    "7": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon but serious idiosyncratic reaction associated with antipsychotic medication. The purpose of this study was to reveal and analyze the clinical characteristics of the reported cases of NMS in patients given the novel antipsychotic olanzapine. A MEDLINE search related to olanzapine-induced NMS cases reported in the international literature was conducted. All cases were critically reviewed and examined against three different sets of NMS diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV, Addonizio, Levenson). The authors identified 17 cases of possible NMS associated with olanzapine. Ten of the reported NMS cases were definitely NMS meeting all three sets of criteria and three cases were probable NMS meeting two sets of criteria. Most of the patients exhibited a full-blown NMS. There were four definite NMS cases associated with olanzapine monotherapy. Three of them had concurrent serious physical illnesses and one had a previous NMS episode. Olanzapine can cause NMS, mainly in susceptible or predisposed patients.", 
    "8": "Mice were acutely intraperitoneally treated with diazepam (DZP), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or NaCl 0.9% (control group), and 15 min later, the DZP-treated group received substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA; NK1 and NK2 natural preferential agonists), [Trp7 beta-Ala8] NKA(4-10) (Trp-7; NK3 antagonist) or vehicle intracerebroventricularly, whereas the PTZ-treated group was intracerebroventricularly administered with FK 888, SR 48968 (NK1 and NK2 antagonists, respectively) or senktide (SENK--[succinil-Asp6, MePhe8] substance P(6-11); NK3 agonist), or vehicle immediately before they were submitted to the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. Another group of animals was repeatedly treated with increasing doses of DZP or NaCl 0.9% intraperitoneally for 28 days, and 3 days after the last injection (test day), animals received DZP, FK 888, SR 48968, SENK or vehicle intracerebroventricularly, or DZP (NaCl 0.9%) intraperitoneally before the EPM evaluation. The anxiolytic action of the acute treatment with DZP was inhibited by the central administration of NKA and Trp-7 but not by SP. NK1 and NK2 antagonists, but not NK3 agonist, blocked the anxiogenic action of PTZ, as evaluated in the plus-maze test. Flumazenil (FLM), a benzodiazepine antagonist, was not able to inhibit the anxiolytic profile of action induced by the NK2 antagonist. Central administration of FK 888 and SR 48968 promoted anxiolytic effects in both control and DZP-withdrawn animals, suggesting a clear relationship between the GABAergic and the tachykinergic systems, mostly involving NK1 and NK2 receptors, in the modulation of experimental anxiety in mice.", 
    "9": "Kava-Kava, a drug derived from a traditional psychoactive beverage used in the South Pacific, is known for tranquilizing and anxiolytic effects. Extracts made from the roots of the Kava plant (Piper methysticum G. Forster) have anxiolytic and mild sedative effects in man. To our knowledge, there are only few data concerning the efficacy of Kava-Kava in animal tests of anxiety. This study was carried out to compare the anxiolytic potential of Kava-Kava extract LI 150 with diazepam. Acute effects of diazepam and a Kava-Kava preparation, compared to their respective controls, were examined in Wistar rats using the elevated plus maze (X-maze). The time spent on open arms, the percentage of open-arm visits and parameters describing the risk assessment were evaluated. LI 150 (120-240 mg/kg p.o.) affected the behaviour measured in the X-maze test, inducing an anxiolytic like behaviour similar to diazepam (15 mg/kg p.o.). These data support the use of Kava-Kava in the treatment of anxiety.", 
    "10": "A new spectrofluorimetric assay for the photodegradation products of the ansiolytic drug alprazolam is described. Alprazolam was found to be highly photolabile and special care should be taken to avoid light exposure during alprazolam storage and handling. The photostability of alprazolam was evaluated at pH 2.0, 3.6 and 5.0. The drug was exposed to UVA-UVB radiations, the photodegradation of alprazolam was followed by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and the developed spectrofluorimetric assay allowed determination of the photodegradation products at very low concentrations (> or = 10(-5) M). The photoinstability was found to increase with the pH value decreasing, consequently acidic media should be avoided during the drug-development process.", 
    "11": "Withdrawal from the neurosteroid 3alpha,5alpha-allopregnanolone after chronic administration of progesterone increases anxiety in female rats and up-regulates the alpha4 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-R) in the hippocampus. We investigated if these phenomena would also occur in male rats. Progesterone withdrawal (PWD) induced higher alpha4 subunit expression in the hippocampus of both male and female rats, in association with increased anxiety (assessed in the elevated plus maze) comparable to effects previously reported. Because alpha4-containing GABA(A)-R are insensitive to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) lorazepam (LZM), and are positively modulated by flumazenil (FLU, a BDZ antagonist), we therefore tested the effects of these compounds following PWD. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, LZM-potentiation of GABA ((EC20))-gated current was markedly reduced in CA1 pyramidal cells of male rats undergoing PWD compared to controls, whereas FLU had no effect on GABA-gated current in control animals but increased it in PWD animals. Behaviorally, both male and female rats were significantly less sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of LZM. In contrast, FLU demonstrated significant anxiolytic effects following PWD. These data suggest that neurosteroid regulation of the alpha4 GABA(A)-R subunit may be a relevant mechanism underlying anxiety disorders, and that this phenomenon is not sex-specific.", 
    "12": "Benzodiazepine (BZD) potentiation of GABA-activated Cl(-)-current (I(GABA)) in recombinant GABA(A) receptors requires the presence of the gamma subunit. When alpha1, beta2 and gamma2S cRNA are expressed in a 1:1:1 ratio in Xenopus oocytes, BZD potentiation of I(GABA) is submaximal, variable and diminishes over time. Potentiation by BZDs is increased, more reproducible and is stabilized over time by increasing the relative amount of cRNA coding for the gamma2S subunit. In addition, GABA EC(50) values for alpha1beta2gamma2 (1:1:1) receptors are intermediate to values measured for alpha1beta2 (1:1) and alpha1beta2gamma2 (1:1:10) receptors. We conclude that co-expression of equal ratios of alpha1, beta2 and gamma2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes produces a mixed population of alpha1beta2 and alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors. Therefore, for accurate measurements of BZD potentiation it is necessary to inject a higher ratio of gamma2 subunit cRNA relative to alpha1 and beta2 cRNA. This results in a purer population of alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors.", 
    "13": "Potentiation of GABA(A) receptor activation through allosteric benzodiazepine (BZ) sites produces the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative/hypnotic effects of BZs. Using a mouse line lacking alpha1 subunit expression, we investigated the contribution of the alpha1 subunit to GABA(A) receptor pharmacology, function and related behaviors in response to BZ site agonists. Competitive [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding experiments using the Type I BZ site agonist, zolpidem, and the Type I and II BZ site non-specific agonist, diazepam, demonstrated the complete loss of Type I BZ binding sites in alpha1(-/-) mice and a compensatory increase in Type II BZ binding sites (41+/-6%, P<0.002). Chloride uptake analysis in alpha1(-/-) mice revealed an increase (108+/-10%, P<0.001) in the efficacy (E(max)) of flunitrazepam while the EC(50) of zolpidem was increased 495+/-26% (alpha1(+/+): 184+/-56 nM; alpha1(-/-): 1096+/-279 nM, P<0.01). An anxiolytic effect of diazepam was detected in both alpha1(+/+) and alpha1(-/-) mice as measured on the elevated plus maze; however, alpha1(-/-) mice exhibited a greater percentage of open arm entries and percentage of open arm time following 0.6 mg/kg diazepam. Furthermore, alpha1(-/-) mice were more sensitive to the motor impairing/sedative effects of diazepam (1-10 mg/kg) as measured by locomotor activity in the open field. Knockout mice were insensitive to the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam (1-15 mg/kg, P<0.001). The hypnotic effect of zolpidem (60 mg/kg) was reduced by 66% (P<0.001) in alpha1(-/-) mice as measured by loss of righting reflex while the effect of diazepam (33 mg/kg) was increased 57% in alpha1(-/-) mice (P<0.05). These studies demonstrate that compensatory adaptations in GABA(A) receptor subunit expression result in subunit substitution and assembly of functional receptors. Such adaptations reveal important relationships between subunit expression, receptor function and behavioral responses.", 
    "14": "A histidine-to-arginine point-mutation at position 101 in the alpha1-subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors has been shown to switch the in vitro efficacy of Ro 15-4513 from inverse agonism to agonism. In order to assess the consequences of this pharmacological switch in vivo, the motor and proconvulsant effects of Ro 15-4513 were analyzed in knock-in mice containing point-mutated alpha1(H101R)-GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore the influence of the alpha1(H101R) substitution on the efficacy of the beta-carboline inverse agonist DMCM was examined both in vitro and in vivo. Ro 15-4513 (10 mg/kg) increased baseline locomotion and potentiated the convulsant effect of pentylenetetrazole in wild type mice. In alpha1(H101R) mice, Ro 15-4513 decreased locomotion and, at a higher dose (30 mg/kg) it displayed an anticonvulsant action. In vitro, DMCM acted as an inverse agonist at recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors whereas it potentiated GABA-evoked chloride currents at alpha1(H101R)beta2gamma2 receptors. DMCM was inactive as a convulsant in alpha1(H101R) mice. In keeping with the major contribution of these receptors to the sedative and anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepine site agonists, the present findings identify the alpha1-GABA(A) receptors as the molecular targets for the allosteric modulation by benzodiazepine site ligands in either direction with regard to the behavioral outputs, sedation/motor stimulation and anticonvulsion/proconvulsion.", 
    "15": "Modulation of GABA(A) receptors induced by both anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) and the benzodiazepine (BZ) site agonist, zolpidem, show equivalent dependence upon gamma subunit composition suggesting that both compounds may be acting at a shared allosteric site. Here we have characterized modulation induced by the AAS, 17alpha-methyltestosterone (17alpha-MeT), for responses elicited from alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2L) GABA(A) receptors and compared it to modulation induced by the BZ site agonists, zolpidem and diazepam. For responses elicited by brief pulses of 20 microM GABA, both the AAS and the BZ site compounds significantly increased the peak current amplitudes and total charge transfer, although 17alpha-MeT was an appreciably weaker agonist than either diazepam or zolpidem at alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2L) receptors. Neither class of modulator enhanced peak current amplitudes for responses elicited by mM concentrations of GABA. BZ site compounds altered time constants of deactivation, desensitization, and recovery from desensitization, however 17alpha-MeT had no overall effect on these parameters. Experiments in which 17alpha-MeT and BZ site ligands were applied concomitantly indicated that potentiation elicited by 17alpha-MeT and zolpidem were additive and that potentiation by 17alpha-MeT could be elicited in the presence of concentrations of flumazenil that blocked BZ potentiation. Finally, kinetic modeling suggests that while effects of 17alpha-MeT can be simulated by altering receptor affinity, the data for these alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2L) receptors were best fitted by simulations in which 17alpha-MeT increases transitions into the singly liganded open state. Taken together, our results suggest that 17alpha-MeT does not act at the high-affinity BZ site, but may elicit some of its effects at the low affinity BZ site or at a novel site.", 
    "16": "Rats are tolerant to benzodiazepine (BZ) anticonvulsant actions two days after ending one-week administration of the BZ, flurazepam (FZP). Concurrently, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition is reduced and AMPA receptor-mediated excitation is selectively enhanced in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. In the present study, the effects of chronic FZP exposure on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents were examined in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices and following acute dissociation. In CA1 neurons from chronic FZP-treated rats, evoked NMDAR EPSC amplitude was significantly decreased (52%) in slices, and the maximal current amplitude of NMDA-induced currents in dissociated neurons was also significantly reduced (58%). Evoked NMDAR EPSCs were not altered following acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques, a selective reduction in NR2B subunit mRNA and protein expression was detected in the CA1 and CA2 regions following FZP treatment. However, total hippocampal NMDAR number, as assessed by autoradiography with the NMDAR antagonist, [(3)H]MK-801, was unchanged by FZP treatment. These findings suggest that reduced NMDAR-mediated currents associated with chronic BZ treatment may be related to reduced NR2B subunit-containing NMDARs in the CA1 and CA2 regions. Altered NMDAR function and expression after chronic BZ exposure may contribute to BZ anticonvulsant tolerance or dependence.", 
    "17": "Newer antipsychotic drugs offer significant clinical advantages for the treatment of psychosis. In particular for the treatment of postpartum disorders newer agents may be suited due to their favourable side-effect profiles. Of concern is the passage of the drugs into breast milk and what potential risks this poses for an infant who is breastfed. The excretion of olanzapine into the breast milk of five lactating women with postpartum psychosis was examined in this study. Nine pairs of plasma and breast-milk samples were collected and the concentration of olanzapine determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Single-point milk-to-plasma ratios were calculated and ranged from 0.2 to 0.84 with a mean of 0.46. The median relative infant dose was 1.6% (range 0-2.5%) of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. During the study period, there were no apparent ill effects on the infant as a consequence of exposure to these doses of olanzapine. As with other antipsychotic drugs this study demonstrates that olanzapine passes into breast milk. The long-term effects of exposure in infants exposed to olanzapine requires further investigation.",

Compared with nonusers, women using benzodiazepines (multivariate odds ratio (MOR) = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-2.01), those taking antidepressants (MOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.14-2.07), and those using anticonvulsants (MOR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.49-4.41) were at increased risk of experiencing frequent falls during the subsequent year. We found no evidence of an independent association between narcotic use and falls (MOR = 0.99 for frequent falling, 95% CI = 0.68-1.43). Among benzodiazepine users, both women using short-acting benzodiazepines (MOR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.98-2.04) and those using long-acting benzodiazepines (MOR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.00-2.43) appeared to be at greater risk of frequent falls than nonusers, although the CIs overlapped 1.0. We found no evidence to suggest that women using selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (MOR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.89-6.30) had a lower risk of frequent falls than those using tricyclic antidepressants (MOR 1.28, 95% CI = 0.90-1.84).",

    "26": "An internal model of the dynamics of a tool or an object is part of the motor memory acquired when learning to use the tool or to manipulate the object. Changes in synaptic efficacy may underlie acquisition and storage of memories. Here we studied the effect of pharmacological agents that interfere with synaptic plasticity on acquisition of new motor memories and on recall of a previously learned internal model. Forty-nine subjects, divided into six groups, made reaching movements while holding a robotic arm that applied forces to the hand. On day 1, all subjects learned to move in force field A. On day 2, each group of subjects was tested on their ability to recall field A and their ability to learn a new internal model in field B. Four groups participated in the experiments of day 2 under the effects of lorazepam (LZ; a GABA type A receptor-positive allosteric modulator), dextromethorphan [DM; an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker], lamotrigine (LG, a drug that blocks voltage-gated Na(+) and Ca(2+) channel), or scopolamine (SP; muscarinic receptor antagonist). Two control groups were tested in a drug-free condition: one group that was not exposed to additional experimental protocols (NP) and another group was tested under ~24 h of sleep deprivation between completion of learning on day 1 and start of testing on day 2 (SD). Recall of field A was normal in all groups. Learning of field B was reduced by LZ and DM but not by SP, LG, SD or in the NP condition. These results suggest that a 24-h sleep-deprivation period may have little or no effect on consolidation of this motor memory and that NMDA receptor activation and GABAergic inhibition are mechanisms operating in the acquisition but not recall of new motor memories in humans.", 
    "27": "The hypothalamus influences a number of autonomic functions. The activity of hypothalamic neurons is modulated in part by release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA onto these neurons. GABA(A) receptors are formed from a number of distinct subunits, designated alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and theta, many of which have multiple isoforms. Little data exist, however, on the functional characteristics of the GABA(A) receptors present on hypothalamic neurons. To gain insight into which GABA(A) receptor subunits are functionally expressed in the hypothalamus, we used an array of pharmacologic assessments. Whole cell recordings were made from thin hypothalamic slices obtained from 1- to 14-day-old rats. GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents were detected in all neurons tested and had an average EC(50) of 20 +/- 1.6 microM. Hypothalamic GABA(A) receptors were modulated by diazepam (EC(50) = 0.060 microM), zolpidem (EC(50) = 0.19 microM), loreclezole (EC(50) = 4.4 microM), methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline (EC(50) = 7.7 microM), and 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-hydroxy-20-one (3alpha-OH-DHP). Conversely, these receptors were inhibited by Zn(2+) (IC(50) = 70.5 microM), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (IC(50) = 16.7 microM), and picrotoxin (IC(50) = 2.6 microM). The alpha4/6-selective antagonist furosemide (10-1,000 microM) was ineffective in all hypothalamic neurons tested. The results of our pharmacological analysis suggest that hypothalamic neurons express functional GABA(A) receptor subtypes that incorporate alpha1 and/or alpha2 subunits, beta2 and/or beta3 subunits, and the gamma2 subunit. Our results suggest receptors expressing alpha3-alpha6, beta1, gamma1, and delta, if present, represent a minor component of functional hypothalamic GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "28": "Mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the hippocampus play a major role in the control of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, mediating the proactive feedback of glucocorticoids in the maintenance of basal activity. Intracerebroventricular and intrahippocampal MR blockade stimulates HPA axis in animals; the systemic administration of mineralocorticoid antagonists enhances spontaneous and CRH-stimulated ACTH and cortisol secretion in humans. Benzodiazepines, namely alprazolam, activate central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic receptors, which are mainly distributed in the hippocampus. Alprazolam has a inhibitory effect on HPA axis either in basal conditions or after central nervous system-mediated stimuli. In humans, alprazolam strongly reduces the corticotroph responsiveness to removal of glucocorticoid feedback by metyrapone. We studied the effect of alprazolam (0.02 mg/kg, orally) on the effect of canrenoate (CAN), an MR antagonist (200 mg as an iv bolus, followed by 200 mg infused in 250 ml saline) or placebo on ACTH, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) secretion in six normal young women (aged 25-32 yr; body mass index, 19-23 kg/m(2)). During placebo, ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA secretion showed a progressive decrease (baseline vs. nadir, mean +/- SEM, from 1830-2400 h, 2.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.3 pmol/liter, 133.2 +/- 16.4 vs. 46.9 +/- 5.2 nmol/liter, and 22.6 +/- 2.3 vs. 18.6 +/- 2.3 nmol/liter, respectively), although statistical significance was obtained for ACTH and cortisol only (P < 0.05). During CAN treatment, ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA secretion showed a progressive rise, which began at approximately 2100 h and peaked between 2300 and 2400 h (2.9 +/- 0.3 pmol/liter, 172.6 +/- 27.9 nmol/liter, and 45.3 +/- 10.7 nmol/liter, respectively; P < 0.05). Alprazolam abolished the CAN-induced increases in ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA levels (1.8 +/- 0.1 pmol/liter, 59.7 +/- 8.6 nmol/liter, and 19.8 +/- 6.7 nmol/liter; P < 0.05), inducing hormonal peaks overlapping with those recorded after placebo in the absence of any treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of GABAergic activation by alprazolam overrides the stimulatory effect of mineralocorticoid blockade by canrenoate on the HPA axis in humans. These findings emphasize the role of GABA in the control of the HPA axis in humans.", 
    "29": "The 30-minute ratio of 1'-hydroxymidazolam:midazolam plasma concentrations has been used as a measure of midazolam clearance in liver transplant patients. This study determined if a single concentration of 1'-hydroxymidazolam or the ratio of 1'-hydroxymidazolam:midazolam could be used to predict midazolam clearance in healthy subjects. Plasma midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam concentrations from three previous studies were used for analyses. Data obtained predose and at 5, 30, 60, 120, 240, 300, and 360 minutes following intravenous doses of midazolam in 61 adults were divided and used to derive and validate equations to predict midazolam clearance. Equations were derived using linear regression and then validated by comparing predicted to observed clearance. Only one equation was related to midazolam clearance as afunction of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, but it did not predict midazolam clearance (r = 0.29, p = 0.31). Single sampling of 1'-hydroxymidazolam or 1'-hydroxymidazolam:midazolam plasma concentrations cannot be used to predict midazolam clearance in healthy adults.",

In Denmark, there are four registered atypical antipsychotic drugs; clozapine, sulpiride, olanzapine, and risperidone. The topic of interest is the effectiveness and side effects of these drugs as compared to the conventional antipsychotic, pimozide, which is today the preferred pharmacological treatment of Tourette's syndrome among the antipsychotics. The conclusion is that risperidone would be a good first-line antipsychotic drug for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome. It is as effective as pimozide, its side effect profile is overall much more favourable, and unlike pimozide it does not contain the risk of causing heart arrhythmia.", 
    "31": "The first-order kinetic equation for irreversible reactions was used to determine the enantiomerization barrier of some of 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepine enantiomers by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). The racemates of lorazepam, oxazepam and temazepam were separated by SFC on chiral (R,R)-Whelk-O1 column with supercritical carbon dioxide containing 12.5% methanol and 0.5% diethylamine as a mobile phase. Peak areas of enantiomers prior to (A(A0), A(B0)) and after the separation (A(A), A(B)), used for calculation of the enantiomerization barrier, were determined by computer-assisted peak deconvolution of peak clusters from the chromatograms. It was demonstrated for the first time that using a model for a four-peak cluster produces height precise results, and most closely approximates the published results. The kinetic equation for irreversible reactions was used to determine apparent enantiomerization rate constants. The dependence of the apparent enatiomerization barrier (deltaG(app)(A-->B), deltaG(app)(B-->A)) on temperature was used to determine apparent activation enthalpy (deltaH(app)(R-->S), deltaH(app)(S-->R)) and entropy (deltaS(app)(R-->S), deltaS(app)(S-->R)) for all studied benzodiazepines.", 
    "32": "New sequence selective mixed imine-amide pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers have been developed that are comprised of DC-81 and dilactam of DC-81 subunits tethered to their C8 positions through alkanedioxy linkers (comprised of three to five and eight carbons). Thermal denaturation studies show that after 18 h of incubation with calf thymus DNA at a 5:1 DNA/ligand ratio, one of them (5c) increases the DeltaT(m) value by 17.0 degrees C. Therefore, these unsymmetrical molecules exhibit significant DNA minor groove binding affinity and 5c linked through the pentanedioxy chain exhibits efficient DNA binding ability that compares with the cross-linking DSB-120 PBD dimer (DeltaT(m) = 15.4 degrees C). Interestingly, this imine-amide PBD dimer has been linked with a five carbon chain linker unlike DSB-120, which has two DC-81 subunits with a three carbon chain linker, illustrating the effect of the noncross-linking aspect by introducing the noncovalent subunit. The binding affinity of the compounds has been measured by restriction endonuclease digestion assay based on inhibition of the restriction endonuclease BamHI. This study reveals the significance of noncovalent interactions in combination with covalent bonding aspects when two moieties of structural similarities are joined together. This allows the mixed imine-amide PBD dimer with a five carbon chain linker to achieve an isohelical fit within the DNA minor groove taking in to account both the covalent bonding and the noncovalent binding components. This has been supported by molecular modeling studies, which indicate that the PBD dimer with a five carbon chain linker gives rise to maximum stabilization of the complex with DNA at the minor groove as compared to the other PBD dimers with three, four, and eight carbon chain linkers. The energy of interaction in all of the complexes studied is correlated to the DeltaT(m) values. Furthermore, this dimer 5c has significant cytotoxicity in a number of human cancer cell lines.", 
    "33": "Ketamine and atropine are often combined in a single syringe for im injection for pediatric conscious sedation; however, the effort of adding midazolam to this combination has not been studied. We investigated the single im injection of ketamine, atropine and midazolam (KAM) to determine if it causes histologic damage around the injection site in a rat model. Group 1 (n = 12) received a single in injection of ketamine, atropine and midazolam in the proportion given during pediatric conscious sedation. Group 2 (n = 12) received an equal volume of isotonic saline im. Group 3 (n = 5) received ketamine and atropine (KA), and a single rat (normal) received no injection. Four rats from each group were sacrificed at 1, 3 and 7 days post-injection, except group 3 KA rats were all sacrificed at 7 d. The injected limbs were harvested, fixed in formalin, decalcified in hydrochloric acid, cut, and mounted on slides. A pathologist examined the slides blinded to the slide label. On d 1 the injection sites of all groups had myocyte degeneration and necrosis with histiocytic infiltrates as well as perimysial edema and hemorrhage. These changes in varying degrees through d 3. By d 7 all histopathological processes had resolved in the saline injected rats and there was mild to no damage in the KA-injected rats. All rats that received KAM injections still had persistent pathologic changes 7 d post-injection. There was histologic evidence that ketamine, atropine and midazolam combination may lead to long-lasting, degenerative changes at the site of the im injection.",

We report 2 patients who claimed repeated envenomation to receive narcotic administration; 1 claimed black widow bite on 8 occasions at 7 separate healthcare facilities, the other claimed to have been bitten by a copperhead snake on 7 occasions at 4 separate healthcare facilities. A 3rd patient complained of lionfish envenomation with no tissue reaction and was refused analgesia. Inconsistent clinical presentations of envenomations may signal drug-seeking behaviors.", 
    "35": "Atypical antipsychotic medications with lower affinities for D2 receptors are considered useful alternatives to treat drug-induced hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, unforced titration, parallel design study (2:1 drug to placebo randomization ratio) using olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/day to effect) in 30 PD patients with drug-induced hallucinations. We performed an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), assessments of on and off time at baseline and at 9 weeks after starting the medication. Sixteen patients on olanzapine (mean dose, 4.6 mg/night) and 11 on placebo completed the study. Compared with placebo, performance on the UPDRS item 2 (thought disorder), and a structured interview for hallucinations, both tended to improve on drug but neither reached statistical significance. A neuropsychological test battery did not show any significant differences. Total on UPDRS motor scores (P < 0.05) and timed tapping (P < 0.01) worsened while on drug compared to placebo. Bradykinesia (P < 0.01) and gait (P < 0.001) items on the UPDRS largely accounted for this deterioration. After completion of the study, 8 of 16 patients randomly assigned to drug continued olanzapine at a mean dose of 2.4 mg/day. However, at the last recorded visit only 5 of 24 (20.8%) of all patients exposed to drug (including those originally randomly assigned to placebo) remained on olanzapine. In patients with PD, low-dose olanzapine did not significantly improve hallucinations but did worsen motor function.",

    "40": "Following induction of acute neuroinflammation by intracisternal injection of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) in rats, quantitative autoradiography was used to assess the regional level of microglial activation and glutamate (NMDA) receptor binding. The possible protective action of the antioxidant phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone in this model was tested by administering the drug in the drinking water for 6 days starting 24 hafter endotoxin injection. Animals were killed 7 days post-injection and consecutive cryostat brain sections labeled with [3H]PK11195 as a marker of activated microglia and [125I]iodoMK801 as a marker of the open-channel, activated state of NMDA receptors. Lipopolysaccharide increased [3H]PK11195 binding in the brain, with the largest increases (two- to threefold) in temporal and entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and substantia innominata. A significant (> 50%) decrease in [125I]iodoMK801 binding was found in the same brain regions. Phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone treatment resulted in a partial inhibition (approx. 25% decrease) of the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in [3H]PK11195 binding but completely reversed the lipopolysaccharide-induced decrease in [125I]iodoMK80 binding in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and substantia innominata. Loss of NMDA receptor function in cortical and hippocampal regions may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in diseases with a neuroinflammatory component, such as meningitis or Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "41": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary neurotransmitter that is responsible for the fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. A major post-translational mechanism that can rapidly regulate GABAAR function is receptor phosphorylation. This study was designed to test the effect of endogenous calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II) activation on both allosteric modulator binding and GABAA receptor subunit phosphorylation. Endogenous CaM kinase II activity was stimulated, and GABAA receptors were subsequently analyzed for bothallosteric modulator binding properties and immunoprecipitated and analyzed for subunit phosphorylation levels. A significant increase in allosteric-modulator binding of the GABAAR was observed under conditions maximal for CaM kinase II activation. In addition, CaM kinase II activation resulted in a direct increase in phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit. The data suggest that the CaM kinase II-dependent phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit modulated allosteric modulator binding to the GABAA receptor.",

    "46": "The integrins alpha(v)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5), alpha(v)beta(6) and alpha(v)beta(8) have all recently been shown to interact with the RGD motif of the latency-associated peptide (LAPbeta(1)) of transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGFbeta(1)), with binding to alpha(v)beta(6) and alpha(v)beta(8) leading to TGFbeta(1) activation. Previously it has been suggested that the remaining alpha(v) integrin, alpha(v)beta(3,) does not interact with LAPbeta(1). However, here we show clearly that alpha(v)beta(3) does indeed interact with the LAPbeta(1) RGD motif. This interaction is similar to other alpha(v)beta(3) ligands in terms of the cations required for adhesion, the concentrations of LAPbeta(1) required for binding and the ability of a small-molecule inhibitor of alpha(v)beta(3), SB223245, to block the interaction. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins we have mapped a minimal integrin-binding loop in LAPbeta(1) and then used this approach to probe the integrin-binding properties of the equivalent loops in LAPbeta(2) and LAPbeta(3). We show that the RGD motif of LAPbeta(3) also interacts with alpha(v)beta(3), in addition to alpha(v)beta(6), alpha(v)beta(1) and alpha(v)beta(5), whereas the corresponding loop in LAPbeta(2) does not interact with these integrins. These observations therefore correct a previously reported inaccuracy in the literature. Furthermore, they are important as they link alpha(v)beta(3) and TGFbeta, which may have implications in cancer and a number of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases where expression of both proteins has been documented.", 
    "47": "The biflavone amentoflavone is an ingredient of Hypericum perforatum L. (Clusiaceae), a plant which is widely used for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. Amentoflavone inhibits the binding of flumazenil to the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA A -receptor (IC(50) = 14.9 nM). Since it has to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) before reaching this receptor, the penetration of [(3)H]-amentoflavone through BBB was studied in an in vitro model consisting of primary cell cultures of porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). Concentration-dependent uptake (37-2000 nM) was neither saturable nor temperature-sensitive indicating passive diffusion as the major uptake mechanism. This finding was confirmed by transport experiments through BCEC monolayers (> 2 % of applied dose was transported after 30 min). Co-administration of Hypericum extract increased amentoflavone transport significantly (amentoflavone alone: permeability coefficient P(app) = 4.59.10(-6) cm/s; co-administrated sucrose: P(app) = 3.22.10(-6)cm/s; amentoflavone together with hypericum: P(app) = 6.74.10(-6)cm/s, co-administrated sucrose P(app) = 5.49.10(-6)cm/s) indicating that Hypericum constituents enhance amentoflavone transport possibly by modulating paracellular permeability. Experiments with the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpressing cell line P388-MDR showed that amentoflavone uptake was significantly enhanced by addition of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil, suggesting a P-gp mediated back-transport out of the cells. In conclusion, our findings show, that amentoflavone is able to pass the blood-brain barrier in vitro by passive diffusion.", 
    "48": "The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that the dissolution rate of oxazepam in interactive mixtures was dependent on the influence of surfactant within the microenvironment of mixed oxazepam-surfactant aggegrates produced during dissolution. The studies utilised both powder and intrinsic dissolution methodology; spectrophotometric assays were developed and validated and dissolution data were modelled using multi-exponential equations and dissolution rate constants estimated using non-linear least squares algorithms. For a series of water-soluble ternary additives to the oxazepam interactive mixture, sodium lauryl sulfate and cetrimide were shown not only to decrease aggregation through enhanced dispersion, but also to increase the dissolution rate constant. Such an increase in dissolution rate constant was observed in the intrinsic dissolution studies when surfactant concentrations exceeded the critical micelle concentration and the oxazepam solubility increased. Laser diffraction particle sizing during the dissolution process confirmed the presence of dispersed particles and aggregates and demonstrated that the presence of surfactant improved the state of dispersion. The results of studies using different rotational speeds produced unexpected increases in aggregation and decreases in dissolution rate constants at about 150 rev min(-1), consistent with the transient formation of loose aggregates containing dissolved surfactant.", 
    "49": "Administration of opioids to alleviate moderate to severe acute pain and chronic cancer pain is an established management process. However, advancements in clinical pharmacologic research have shown that opioids are also effective in chronic noncancerous pain. Many patients properly treated for prolonged periods with opioids develop tolerance and subsequently, physical dependence. This process is not necessarily harmful to the patient and will not cause the patient to develop an addiction (properly defined as psychologic dependence). For many patients who have been on opioid therapy for months or years, analgesic effectiveness tragically becomes less. In addition, opioid-induced constipation can be severe and cause pain; patients do not develop tolerance to this adverse reaction. Therefore, such issues become a management problem and require additional intervention. Currently, many different classes of drugs can serve as effective adjuncts to opioids for treatment of pain. Adding adjunctive medication to opioid therapy improves pain management primarily by nonopioid mechanisms of action. Clinical outcomes of such combinations include greater analgesia and attenuation of opioid-induced adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression. Adjuncts include acetaminophen, antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, capsaicin, calcium channel blockers, clonidine hydrochloride, central nervous system stimulants, corticosteroids, local anesthetics, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, pentoxifylline, and scopolamine. Some adjuncts (eg, acetaminophen) are routinely used today, whereas others (eg, nifedipine [calcium channel blocker]) are used on a limited basis but have great potential for more widespread application. All professionals (eg, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, physicians' assistants, social workers, members of the clergy) involved in treating patients with unresolved pain recognize this to be an extraordinary and delicate time. It is when patients are likely to request physicians to provide some method to accelerate their death. Thus, inadequate analgesia can become a suicidogen, ie, any factor that causes a patient to want to commit suicide. Incorporation of adjuncts to opioid therapy can serve to lessen pain and improve quality of life for a suffering patient.", 
    "50": "The GABA(A) receptor/chloride ionophore is allosterically modulated by several classes of anxiolytic and anticonvulsant agents, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates and neurosteroids. Etifoxine, an anxiolytic and anticonvulsant compound competitively inhibited the binding of [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphoro-thionate (TBPS), a specific ligand of the GABA(A) receptor chloride channel site. To investigate the etifoxine modulatory effects on the different binding sites of the GABA(A) receptor complex, we have examined the effects of etifoxine on binding of the receptor agonist [(3)H]muscimol and the benzodiazepine modulator [(3)H]flunitrazepam in rat brain membrane preparations. The anticonvulsant properties of etifoxine combined with muscimol and flunitrazepam were performed in mice with picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures. Etifoxine modestly enhanced binding of [(3)H]muscimol and of [(3)H]flunitrazepam by increasing the number of binding sites without changing the binding affinity of [(3)H]flunitrazepam. In contrast, the compound decreased the affinity of muscimol for its binding site. In vivo, the combination of subactive doses of etifoxine with muscimol or flunitrazepam produced an anticonvulsant additive effect against the picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice. These results suggest that the interaction of etifoxine on the GABA(A) receptor complex would allosterically modify different binding sites due to conformational changes. Functionally, the resulting facilitation of GABA transmission underlies the pharmacological properties of etifoxine.", 
    "51": "Male Long-Evans rats were trained to discriminate mCPP (1.4 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline, using a two-lever, food-reinforced operant task. The GABA(A) antagonist, bicuculline (0.16-0.64 mg/kg), partially substituted for mCPP, whereas the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (1-10 mg/kg), and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513 (0.25-2.5 mg/kg), failed to substitute for mCPP. Bicuculline produced no change in response rate, whereas Ro 15-4513 dose-dependently decreased responding. Flumazenil produced a small increase in response rates. Flumazenil (10 mg/kg), Ro 15-4513 (1.25 mg/kg), and the benzodiazepine agonists alprazolam (0.64 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg) full agonist all failed to block the mCPP discriminative stimulus. When given in combination with mCPP, Ro15-4513 and alprazolam both produced lower response rates than did mCPP alone, whereas flumazenil and diazepam did not significantly alter response rates. These findings provide evidence that GABA(A) antagonists modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of mCPP, but that these effects are not mediated by activity at the benzodiazepine site.",

Our aim was to examine the physiological, cognitive, and behavioral effects of flunitrazepam (FN) and clonazepam (CLO). In the first study, ten healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of 2 mg of FN. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), behavioral reports and staff observations were then collected. In the second study, ten healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of 3 mg of CLO. Vital signs, performance on the MMSE and Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and behavioral changes were examined. FN significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure 4 h post drug ingestion with diastolic remaining low at 6 h. CLO was associated with changes in temperature and decreased systolic pressure. FN affected memory and attention 4 h following ingestion. CLO affected memory and attention throughout the study (6 h), and psychomotor performance was decreased 2 h post ingestion.

    "55": "GYKI 53784 or LY303070 [(-)1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-4,5-dihydro-3-methylcarbamoyl-2,3-benzodiazepine] belongs to a new family of 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds (also called homophtalazines) selective and non-competitive antagonists at alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors. These compounds include the original GYKI-52466, its more potent derivative GYKI 53655 and the active isomer of the latter, GYKI 53784. This review summarizes current knowledge of this novel AMPA antagonist: GYKI 53784. GYKI 53784 is the most potent of the compounds in the 2,3-benzodiazepine class, blocking AMPA receptor-mediated responses. In contrast to the compounds of the quinoxalinedione family, that block AMPA as well as kainate receptors, GYKI 53784 does not block the activation of kainate receptors. Furthermore, GYKI 53784 does not act at the same receptor site as positive AMPA modulators (i.e., cyclothiazide, BDP-12, 1-BCP or aniracetam). GYKI 53784 is a powerful neuroprotective agent in both in vitro and in vivo models of AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. In contrast to NMDA receptor antagonists, whose favorable clinical actions are compromised by important side effects such as the impairment of memory functions, the selective AMPA antagonist, GYKI 53784, may be of potential clinical value, both in acute (stroke and trauma) and chronic (Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy) neurological disorders.", 
    "56": "Olanzapine is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) 1A2. In this study, pharmacokinetic interactions and clinical effects of adding the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine to steady-state olanzapine was examined in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Eight patients had been treated for at least 3 months with 10 to 20 mg/day olanzapine. Fluvoxamine (100 mg/day) was added (week 0) to the olanzapine treatment and continued for 8 weeks. Concentrations of olanzapine and its metabolite N-desmethylolanzapine and of fluvoxamine were analyzed at weeks 0, 1, 4, and 8. Addition of fluvoxamine resulted in a 12% to 112% ( < 0.01) increase of olanzapine from 31 +/- SD 15 ng/mL (week 0) to 56 +/- 31 ng/mL (week 8) in all patients. N-desmethylolanzapine concentrations were not significantly changed ( > 0.05). Fluvoxamine concentrations were 48 +/- 26 ng/mL on week 1 and 83 +/- 47 ng/mL on week 8. It is concluded that fluvoxamine affects olanzapine degradation and thus increases olanzapine concentrations. Although the combination was well tolerated in this sample and the negative symptom response appeared to be favorable in at least five patients, the combination therapy of olanzapine and fluvoxamine should be used cautiously and should be controlled by therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid olanzapine-induced side effects or intoxications.", 
    "57": "The effects of olanzapine on the symptomatology of children with pervasive developmental disorder with emphasis on problems of communication and the safety of the drug were investigated in a 3-month open-label, open-dosage study. Participating in the study were 25 children age 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of either autistic disorder or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Psychometric measures included the Clinical Global Impression of Severity/Improvement, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, and the TARGET (a checklist of five target symptoms). Communication skills were assessed during behavioral analysis of a playroom session. Safety measures included clinical chemistry variables, electrocardiography, the SimpsonAngus Neurological Rating Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and vital signs. Twenty-three children completed the study and showed significant improvement on three subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (Irritability, Hyperactivity, and Excessive Speech) and the TARGET. The final mean dose was 10.7 mg/day. Several aspects of communication were also improved after olanzapine treatment. However, only three children were considered responders in terms of the Clinical Global Impression of Severity/Improvement scores. The most important adverse events were weight gain, increased appetite, and loss of strength. Three children showed extrapyramidal symptoms that disappeared after the dose was lowered. Thus, while olanzapine was a relatively safe medication in children, its clinical relevance in children with pervasive developmental disorder may be limited.",

Pharmacotherapy is less effective in this group of patients. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of olanzapine as an add-on therapy in patients with bipolar disorder with a rapid cycling course during a dysphoric mania episode. Thirteen patients treated with mood stabilizers for at least 1 year and diagnosed with a mixed episode were included in an open trial. All had at least 4 episodes in the last year. Patients with organic diseases, including altered thyroid function, were excluded from the research. Patients were evaluated at inclusion and at day 28. Response was defined as a decrease of 50% in the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression concomitant with a Clinical Global Impression improvement of 1 or 2. All patients completed the study. The doses of olanzapine were 16.15 +/- 5.82 mg/day. There was a reduction in the manic and depressive symptoms in all patients. Ten of the 13 patients were considered to have responded to the treatment according to the response definition. Adverse effects included somnolence (23.08%) and weight gain (0.81 +/- 1.96 kg in women, 2.20 +/- 2.28 kg in men). Our results suggest that olanzapine combined with mood stabilizers is safe and effective in the treatment of the manic and the depressive symptoms of dysphoric mania with a rapid cycling course.", 
    "59": "We studied the effects of flumazenil on diaphragm muscle dysfunction caused by midazolam in dogs. Animals were divided into three groups of eight each. In each group, anesthetic doses (0.1 mg/kg initial dose plus 0.5 mg. kg(-1). h(-1) maintenance dose) of midazolam were administered for 60 min. Immediately after the end of midazolam administration, Group 1 received no study drug; Group 2 was infused small-dose (0.004 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)) flumazenil; Group 3 was infused with large-dose (0.02 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)) flumazenil. We assessed diaphragm muscle function (contractility and electrical activity) by transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) and integrated electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). After midazolam was administered in each group, Pdi at low-frequency (20-Hz) and high-frequency (100-Hz) stimulation decreased from baseline values (P < 0.05), and values of Edi at 100-Hz stimulation were less than those obtained during baseline (P < 0.05). In Group 1, Pdi and Edi to each stimulus did not change from midazolam-induced values. In Groups 2 and 3, with an infusion of flumazenil, Pdi at both stimuli and Edi at 100-Hz stimulation increased from midazolam-induced values (P < 0.05). The increase in Pdi and Edi was more in Group 3 than in Group 2 (P < 0.05). We conclude that flumazenil recovers the diaphragm muscle dysfunction (reduced contractility and inhibited electrical activity) caused by anesthetic doses of midazolam in dogs.",

    "61": "Synthesis and pharmacological activity of 1,6-diaryl-5,7(1H)dioxo-2,3-dihydroimidazo-[1,2-a][1,3,5]triazines (C) are presented. The title compounds were obtained from 1-arylimidazolinurea derivatives in cyclization reaction with difunctional carbonyl reagents--phosgene (method I) or carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) (method II). Their molecular structures were confirmed by the X-ray analysis of 1-phenyl-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,7(1H)-dioxo-2,3-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a][1,3,5]triazine (C2) crystals. Compounds C exhibited significant depressive action on the central nervous system (CNS) of the laboratory animals, correlated with very low acute toxicity (LD(50) > 2000 mg kg(-1) i.p.), and showed antinociceptive activity in behavioural models. Reversion of this effect by small dose of naloxone (5 mg kg(-1)) can suggest opioid-like mechanism of antinociception produced by these and other carbonyl derivatives of 1-aryl-2-iminoimidazolidine. Additionally, an effect on the serotonin neurotransmission pathway was also observed. The receptor mechanism of activity for investigated compounds was confirmed only for the opioid mu receptor in binding affinity assay test. Same tests performed for the serotonin 5-HT(2) and benzodiazepine BZD receptors showed no affinity for tested compounds. The opioid-like and serotonergic activities are similar to these described earlier for chain carbonyl 1-aryl-2-iminoimidazolidine derivatives containing urea moiety, mainly due to similar chemical structure, although compounds C are not able to adopt any of the higher energy conformations of urea derivatives. Rigid location of aromatic ring (Ar') at N6, acting as a spacer blocking any direct access to the carbonyl groups (e.g. through the hydrogen bonding), could be responsible for lack of affinity toward 5-HT(2) expressed in the binding assay test.", 
    "62": "Recent indications of oxidative stress in hypothalamus of sleep deprived rats prompted us to address the possibility that sleep deprivation may induce pathological cell loss changes in brain. Indices of necrosis and apoptosis were quantified after 96 h of sleep deprivation induced by the classical platform technique in rats. Binding of the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine ligand [3H]PK 11195 to reactive astrocytes, a reliable and sensitive index of necrotic changes, was not altered in any of 14 brain regions examined. Likewise, no changes were found in mRNA levels of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and bax in any of 24 brain regions examined. This was corroborated by quantitative TUNEL analyses in hypothalamus, amygdala, and cortex, which also revealed no effects in sleep deprived animals. These results are consistent with other recent evidence that sleep deprivation does not induce necrotic or apoptotic cell loss in brain. This suggests that recent findings of oxidative stress in sleep deprived brains do not result in cell loss. The possibility that sleep deprivation may result in functional deficits, or that structural changes may emerge after repeated episodes of sleep deprivation, remains to be addressed.",

    "68": "A novel highly discriminating adjacency-cum-distance-based topological descriptor, termed the adjacent eccentric distance sum index, has been conceptualized and its discriminating power investigated with regard to the anti-HIV activity of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-imidazo-[4,5,1- jk] [1,4] benzodiazepin-2 (1 H)-one (TIBO) derivatives. The discriminating power of the adjacent eccentric distance sum index was compared with that of the eccentric connectivity index - another adjacency-cum-distance-based topological descriptor. The values of the eccentric connectivity index and the adjacent eccentric distance sum index of each of 121 analogues comprising the data set were computed and active ranges were identified. Subsequently, a biological activity was assigned to each analogue involved in the data set and this was then compared with the reported anti-HIV activity. Excellent correlations were observed between anti-HIV activity and both the topological descriptors. Although the overall accuracy of prediction was found to be approximately 84% in case of the eccentric connectivity index and approximately 86% in case of adjacent eccentric distance sum index, the predictability using the adjacent eccentric distance sum index in the active range itself was >92%. The proposed index offers a vast potential for structure-activity/property studies.",

We found that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands have significant beneficial therapeutic action on the development of spontaneous rheumatoid arthritis-like signs. Concomitantly, we mapped immunoreactive peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in inflamed tissues, and we observed that in addition to the infiltrated leukocytes, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor was expressed in synovial membranes, at the cartilage pannus junction and in chondrocytes. Interestingly, we observed that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor expression in chondrocytes was reduced when Mrl/lpr mice developed the pathology and restored upon peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand treatment. Altogether, our data provide further evidence of a role played by peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in the regulation of inflammation processes and support new therapeutic applications for specific potent peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands.", 
    "70": "Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and its derivatives are being developed to investigate muscarinic receptor changes in vivo in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. This is the first study of [125I]-(R,R)-I-QNB and [125I]-(R,S)-I-QNB binding in vitro in human brain. We have compared the in vitro binding of the muscarinic ligands [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]AF-DX 384, which have selectivity for the M1 and M2/M4 receptor subtypes, respectively, to the binding of [125I]-(R,R)-I-QNB and [125I]-(R,S)-I-QNB. This will provide a guide to the interpretation of in vivo SPET images generated with [123I]-(R,R)-I-QNB and [123I]-(R,S)-I-QNB. Binding was investigated in striatum, globus pallidus, thalamus and cerebellum, and cingulate, insula, temporal and occipital cortical areas, which show different proportions of muscarinic receptor subtypes, in post-mortem brain from normal individuals. M1 receptors are of high density in cortex and striatum and are relatively low in the thalamus and cerebellum, while M4 receptors are mainly expressed in the striatum, and M2 receptors are most evident in the cerebellum and thalamus. [125I]-(R,R)-I-QNB and [125I]-(R,S)-I-QNB density distribution patterns were consistent with binding to both M1 and M4 receptors, with [125I]-(R,R)-I-QNB additionally binding to a non-cholinergic site not displaceable by atropine. This distribution can be exploited by in vivo imaging, developing ligands for both SPET and PET, to reveal muscarinic receptor changes in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies during the disease process and following cholinergic therapy.", 
    "71": "Taking the controversy over the safety of the hypnotic, Halcion, in the Netherlands and the UK, as a case study, this article examines the problems for public health associated with responses to warnings about drug hazards by regulatory agencies, governmental expert advisers, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession. It is argued that regulators and the medical profession rely too heavily on manufacturers to investigate warnings from doctors' spontaneous reporting of adverse effects of drug products on the market. It is demonstrated that a pharmaceutical firm's commitment to search effectively for evidence against the safety of its own product in order to confirm doctors' warnings can have severe limitations. Deficiencies in the socio-institutional responses to post-market 'early warning systems' about drug hazards imply that the regulatory policies of 'early licensing' and minimal pre-market checks for new drugs are misconceived and threaten public health. To improve public protection from drug injury, the regulators should abandon their conviction that compelling evidence of drug hazards are required to confirm doctors' warning signals prior to regulatory intervention. Instead, they should adopt a policy of measured regulatory intervention as an immediate response to warning signals, while investigators, independent of the manufacturers, assess the significance of the signal.",

However, there is much less in the published literature about the efficacy of these drugs in the elderly and how best to use them in primary psychosis, Parkinson's disease and the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. This review attempts to summarise the current literature and make some tentative recommendations for each of the commonest atypicals, based on the current evidence.",

Patients were monitored by serial administration of the revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) during inpatient detoxification. Patients (N = 55) who reached threshold level of AWS for receiving medication (CIWA-Ar > 9) scored significantly higher (p <.001) on the AUDIT total score, the dependence sub-scale, and the single item on morning drinking. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive power, and screening efficiency showed the value of the AUDIT for identifying patients who developed AWS. The AUDIT should be explored alone and in combination with other parameters to improve screening for clinically meaningful AWS in other settings.",

Subjects included 123 ALC and 66 ALC/COC subjects. Baseline demographic and drug use variables, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and the total amount of oxazepam taken during alcohol detoxification were compared between the two groups. Compared to ALC subjects, ALC/COC subjects were younger, more likely to be African-American, and had less severe histories of alcohol dependence. However, alcohol withdrawal symptom severity did not differ significantly between the two groups. Nevertheless, controlling for differences in alcohol use history, ALC/COC subjects still received less oxazepam than did ALC subjects to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Despite similar intensity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, ALC/COC subjects received less oxazepam to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms compared to ALC subjects. Both subject and clinician factors may explain the difference in oxazepam use.",

The conjugate was composed of lactobionic acid, diamine-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) and cholic acid (abbreviated as LEC). The conjugate was characterized by (1)H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy measurements. In aqueous media, the conjugate can self-assemble to form core-shell type nanoparticles, and the formation of a core-shell structure was observed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The critical association concentration (CAC) of the LEC conjugate nanoparticles was determined from fluorescence excitation spectra to be 0.05 g/l. The LEC nanoparticles were mostly spherical with sizes ranging from 10 to 30 nm. Clonazepam (CNZ) was used as a model hydrophobic drug, and was incorporated into the hydrophobic core of the nanoparticles. CNZ was released more slowly at a higher drug loading due to drug crystallization.",

    "78": "Antipsychotic drugs have been reported to increase the expression of subunits of the NMDA receptor at the level of mRNA but it is not clear whether such effects are apparent at the level of the radioligand binding or receptor protein. Therefore, we examined the effect of treatment of, and withdrawal from, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine or clozapine on the binding of [3H]N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine ([3H]TCP ) to the open ion channel of the NMDA receptor in rat caudate-putamen, hippocampus and frontal cortex. [3H]TCP binding was not significantly different in the caudate-putamen, hippocampus and cortex after three months of treatment with any antipsychotic drug. There were significant decreases in [3H]TCP binding in rat caudate-putamen and cortex, but not hippocampus, one month after ceasing treatment. Decreases in the caudate-putamen were detected in rats previously treated with chlorpromazine (0.1 mg/kg/day) and clozapine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg/day). In the cortex, decreases in [3H]TCP binding were also detected in rats previously treated with olanzapine (0.1 mg/kg/day) for three months. These data suggest that changes in the NMDA receptor associated ion channels occur following antipsychotic drug withdrawal.",

A case-control study was conducted on the use of certain drugs as a risk factor for hospitalization due to fractures after falls among individuals aged 60 years or over in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. One hundred sixty-nine cases and 315 in-patient controls were matched by age, sex, and hospital. Odds ratios (OR) adjusted for potential confounders were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Increased risk of such accidents was found for calcium channel antagonists (OR = 1.96, 1.16-3.30) and benzodiazepines (OR = 2.09, 1.08-4.05), and decreased risk was associated with diuretics (OR = 0.40, 0.20-0.80). Antacids, digitalis, and laxatives were associated with reduced risk of fractures after falls that reached borderline statistical significance (0.05 < p < 0.10). The findings highlight the need to weigh risks and benefits of medication in the elderly. It is also important to advise such individuals and their families on how to avoid falls when such medication proves necessary.",

GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and GABA(A) receptors are expressed by most neurones. [(11)C]Flumazenil (FMZ) PET images the majority of GABA(A) receptor subtypes. We investigated abnormalities of FMZ binding in grey and white matter in 18 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and normal quantitative MRI. Parametric images of FMZ volume of distribution (FMZ-V(d)) were calculated. Twenty-one healthy controls were scanned for comparison. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) was used to localize significant changes in FMZ-V(d) in individual patients and between groups, specifically including the entire white matter in all subjects through explicit masking. Sixteen of 18 patients showed single or multiple abnormalities of FMZ-V(d). Six had hippocampal decreases of FMZ-V(d). Eleven patients showed increased FMZ-V(d) in the temporal lobe white matter (TLWM). Outside the mesial temporal structures, seven showed multiple areas of increase or decrease and only one a single area of decrease. In seven of the 16 patients with abnormalities, findings were concordant with EEG and clinical data, enabling further presurgical evaluation. Group findings were: (i) decreased FMZ-V(d) in the ipsilateral (Z = 3.01) and contralateral (Z = 2.56) hippocampus; (ii) increased FMZ-V(d) in the ipsilateral (Z = 3.71) and contralateral TLWM (two clusters, Z = 3.11 and 2.79); and (iii) increased FMZ-V(d) in the ipsilateral frontal lobe white matter between the superior and medial frontal gyrus (Z = 3.80) with similar changes contralaterally (Z = 4.87). No changes were found in the thalamus and basal ganglia. Region-of-interest analyses indicated an average increase in FMZ binding of 16% in the TLWM ipsilateral to the epileptic focus. PET findings were corroborated by invasive EEG or pathology in five cases. FMZ-PET, analysed by SPM with explicit masking, was sensitive in patients with normal MRI, and hippocampal abnormalities were detected in a third of these patients. Furthermore, increases in FMZ binding in TLWM, indicating microdysgenesis, were detected in the majority of these patients and may represent the structural basis of their epilepsy.",

Many classes of recreational drugs, including benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and opioids, are also metabolized by the liver and can potentially interact with antiretrovirals. Controlled interaction studies are often not available, but clinically significant interactions have been observed in a number of case reports. Overdoses secondary to interactions between the \"rave\" drugs methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and PIs have been reported. PIs, particularly ritonavir, may also inhibit metabolism of amphetamines, ketamine, lysergic acid diethylmide (LSD), and phencyclidine (PCP). Case series and pharmacokinetic studies suggest that nevirapine and efavirenz induce methadone metabolism, which may lead to symptoms of opiate withdrawal. A similar interaction may exist between methadone and the PIs ritonavir and nelfinavir, although the data are less consistent. Opiate metabolism can be inhibited or induced by concomitant PIs, and patients should be monitored for signs of toxicity and/or loss of analgesia. PIs should not be coadministered with midazolam and triazolam, since prolonged sedation may occur.",

    "94": "The association of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) with high leg activity in the same patient is a dilemma for the physician, as clonazepam, used to treat periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS) can aggravate apneas, while nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) can exacerbate PLMS. The present study aimed to compare nCPAP alone (n), nCPAP combined with clonazepam (n+c) and clonazepam alone (c) in patients with mild to moderate SAHS associated with high leg activity. Fourteen patients with an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) between 10 and 50 h(-1) and a leg movement index with regard to time in bed [LMI (TIB)] > 15 h(-1) on baseline polysomnography (b) were recorded on three consecutive nights with n, n+c and c, respectively. Leg movements were detected, using actigraphy, and were subsequently categorized into periodic, apnea- or hypopnea-related and nonperiodic movements (defined as neither periodic nor related to a respiratory event). The three treatments were successful in improving breathing [AHI b 26.1 (3.2) n 11.8 (2.4) n+c 5.0 (0.7) c 14.9 (1.8) h(-1)], leg activity [LMI (TIB) b 391 (4.8) n 22.5 (4.4) n+c 23.9 (3.9) c 22.6 (3.7) h(-1)] and sleep fragmentation [stage shift index b 373 (2.6) n 28.6 (1.6) n+c 25.6 (1.8) c 26.6 (1.6) h(-1)]. All types of movements were reduced, the effect being significant for respiratory events related and nonperiodic movements. Combination therapy was more effective than nCPAP alone in reducing the AHI and in improving sleep efficiency. We conclude that in patients with mild to moderate SASH associated with high leg activity, nCPAP improves nocturnal breathing and clonazepam reduces leg activity. More unexpectedly nCPAP is beneficial on leg activity and clonazepam on breathing, probably through a decrease in sleep fragmentation. The best results are obtained with combination therapy.",

    "99": "Submandibular secretory responses to electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic innervation at variable frequencies were measured in anaesthetized rats. Selective blockade by pirenzepine and by methoctramine occurred at doses (50 and of 300 nmol kg (-1), i.v., respectively) that did not inhibit the responses to exogenous acetylcholine. In the presence of methoctramine, the nerve-evoked fluid responses were increased by 100% at 1 Hz independently of the total number of impulses (10-300), suggesting that M2 receptor activation inhibits transmitter release. The magnitude of the increase was inversely related to frequency of stimulation. The protein concentrations in the fluid responses were not significantly affected by methoctramine. Pirenzepine had an inhibitory effect on the fluid secretory responses, which was dependent of frequency, as well as of number of impulses, suggesting that M1 receptor activation facilitates transmitter release. At 10 Hz given intermittently (for 1 s at 10-s intervals), pirenzepine reduced the fluid response by 25%. The protein release was substantially and significantly reduced by pirenzepine independent of frequency but only during long periods of stimulation (300 impulses). It is concluded that muscarinic M1 receptor activation normally has a facilitatory effect on transmitter release, and that the facilitation occurs during short, intense stimulation. Muscarinic M1 receptors are, however, likely to regulate protein secretion by other mechanisms. Muscarinic M2 receptors, on the other hand, normally inhibit cholinergic transmission at low frequencies. Similar to findings in the alimentary tract of several species, stimulation in bursts at high frequencies is a more efficient stimulation pattern than continuous low frequency stimulation. This pattern of stimulation thus takes advantage of transient facilitation and avoids the inhibition at less intense neuronal activity.", 
    "100": "Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are one of the most prescribed classes of drugs because of their marked anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects. The pharmacological actions of BDZ depend on the activation of 2 specific receptors. The central BDZ receptor, present in several areas of the central nervous system (CNS), is a component of the GABA-A receptor, the activation of which increases GABAergic neurotransmission and is followed by remarkable neuroendocrine effects. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR), structurally and functionally different from the GABA-A receptor, have been shown in peripheral tissues but also in the CNS, in both neurones and glial cells, and in the pituitary gland. BDZ receptors bind to a family of natural peptides called endozepines, firstly isolated from neurons and glial cells in the brain and then in several peripheral tissues as well. Endozepines modulate several central and peripheral biological activities, including some neuroendocrine functions and synthetic BDZ are likely to mimic them, at least partially. BZD, especially alprazolam (AL), possess a clear inhibitory influence on the activity of the HPA axis in both animals and humans. This effect seems to be mediated at the hypothalamic and/or suprahypothalamic level via suppression of CRH. The strong negative influence of AL on hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis agrees with its peculiar efficacy in the treatment of panic disorders and depression. BZD have also been shown to increase GH secretion via mechanisms mediated at the hypothalamic or supra-hypothalamic level, though a pituitary action cannot be ruled out. Besides the impact on HPA and somatotrope function, BDZ also significantly affect the secretion of other pituitary hormones, such as gonadotropins and PRL, probably acting through GABAergic mediation in the hypothalamus and/or in the pituitary gland. In all, BDZ are likely to represent a useful tool to investigate GABAergic activity and clarify its role in the neuroendocrine control of anterior pituitary function; their usefulness probably overrides what had been supposed before.", 
    "101": "In this paper we describe the synthesis of a series of novel 2-[(4-alkylsemicarbazono)-(4-aminophenyl)-methyl]-4,5-methylenedioxyphenylacetic acid alkyl esters (10-19) carrying an alkylsemicarbazono moiety at a benzylic site. The influence of this group on the biological activity was evaluated by testing the corresponding derivatives 20-22 in which the 4-alkylsemicarbazono moiety was removed (compound 20) or its alkylureido portion shifted at position 1 (compounds 21-22). Furthermore, the involvement of the 4-aminobenzyl moiety in the anticonvulsant activity was evaluated by testing derivative 23. The anticonvulsant activity of all compounds was assayed against audiogenic seizures induced in DBA/2 mice. Within this series of derivatives, 2-[(4-aminophenyl)-(4-methylsemicarbazono)-methyl]-4,5-methylenedioxyphenylacetic acid methyl ester (10) proved to be the most active compound. It displayed a potency 5-fold higher than that shown by 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (1, GYKI 52466), a well-known noncompetitive 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist. Compound 10 was also effective in suppressing seizures induced in Swiss mice by maximal electroshock (MES) or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Furthermore, it antagonized in vivo seizures induced by icv administration of AMPA or kainate (KA). Using the patch-clamp technique in primary cultures of granule neurons we tested compounds 10 and 21 for their ability to modulate currents evoked by KA and 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (ATPA). These two derivatives reduced KA and ATPA currents to a larger extent than that shown by reference compound 1. Compounds 10 and 21 were also able to reduce neuronal cell death induced by the application of KA (100 microM).", 
    "102": "In recent years, sedating antidepressants have been increasingly used to treat primary insomnia. Up to now, only one open pilot study with trimipramine and one double-blind placebo-controlled study with doxepin have provided scientific support for this approach in treating primary insomnia. In order to test the hypothesis that sedating antidepressants are useful in the treatment of primary insomnia, the effect of trimipramine on objectively and subjectively measured parameters of sleep was investigated in a double-blind placebo- and lormetazepam-controlled study in a sample of 55 patients with primary insomnia attending outpatient sleep-disorder clinics. Trimipramine was selected since it has shown positive effects on sleep continuity with a lack of REM sleep suppression in studies on depressed patients and in one pilot study on patients with primary insomnia. Trimipramine at an average dose of 100 mg over a period of 4 weeks significantly enhanced sleep efficiency, but not total sleep time (which had been the primary target variable) compared to placebo as measured by polysomnography. Changes in objective sleep parameters were paralleled by changes in subjective sleep parameters. Trimipramine did not suppress REM sleep. Lormetazepam decreased wake time and sleep stage 3 and increased REM sleep compared to placebo. After switching trimipramine to placebo, sleep parameters returned to baseline. There was no evidence of any rebound effect from trimipramine. Side effects from trimipramine were only marginal. This first double-blind placebo-controlled study with trimipramine suggests its efficacy in the treatment of primary insomnia. However, due to the large intra- and interindividual variance in the parameters of interest before and during treatment a larger sample size would have been necessary to strengthen the validity of our findings.", 
    "103": "The aim of this investigation was to compare the degree of striatal dopamine-(D2) receptor blockade by two atypical antipsychotic drugs, risperidone and olanzapine. The percentage of D2 receptor occupancy during treatment was calculated by comparing the results of 123I-iodobenzamide SPECT with those from healthy control subjects. Twenty inpatients suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective psychosis according to DSM IV/ICD-10 criteria were treated with clinically recommended doses of risperidone and compared with 13 inpatients treated with up to 20 mg olanzapine. Neuroleptic dose and D2 receptor blockade correlated strongly for both risperidone (Pearson r = -0.86, p = 0.0001) and olanzapine (Pearson r = -0.77, p = 0.002). There was no significant difference between the D2 receptor occupancy of the two substances when given in the clinically recommended dose range (unpaired t-test, t = -0.112, p = 0.911).", 
    "104": "The treatment of dystonia is exclusively difficult. Recently botulinum toxin has been introduced into the market, but its indication is still limited. Oral administration of high dosage of anticholinergic drugs is firstly recommended for the treatment of dystonia. Effective cases usually do not show obvious side effects. Likely, diazepam is another choice, and the drug usually does not bring any adverse effect in cases with good results. Effects of other drugs such as l-dopa and antidopaminergic agents are still under discussion. In cases with myoclonus and/or tremor clonazepam can be useful for improvement of the phasic symptoms. As the prognosis of dystonia especially that of focal dystonia is not hopeless, the patients with dystonia should be informed of the facts.", 
    "105": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a condition requiring emergency care. There are convulsive SE, non-convulsive SE including complex partial status and absence status, non-convulsive electric SE and pseudostatus epilepticus, although convulsive SE is the most common. Diagnosis of status epilepticus of complex partial seizures (CPS) and absence seizures was significantly delayed because delays in seeking medical attention were common. The seizures were generalized convulsive SE in 84% and CPS status in 16%, and the overall mortality rate was 15% in 41 SE patients of our study. EEG monitoring is important to make or exclude the diagnosis of SE. Diazepam is the first choice medication and effective in the management of SE, and lately, lorazepam, midazolam, propofol and pentobarbital etc as emergency therapy. Phenytoin is also considered first-line agent in the emergency management of SE. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) led to a prolonged latency for seizure induction after an intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and effectively prevented the development of status epilepticus of PTZ-induced convulsions in the rats. Our data suggest that rTMS has suppressive effects on the neuronal excitability in rats. These effects are anticonvulsive and suggest the possibility of therapeutic use of rTMS in the patients with refractory seizures.", 
    "106": "Clinical features of refractory epilepsy in children are symptomatic localization-related epilepsy, especially frontal lobe epilepsy, the onset in young age less than 3 years-old, and complication of developmental retardation. The treatments usually start with one drug of choice for specific seizure type. In the idiopathic epilepsy group, valproic acid was effective in 82% of the patients with generalized epilepsy and in 45% of localization-related epilepsy while carbamazepine was effective in 71% and 67%, respectively. However, in the refractory group which did not react to the drugs of choice at the initial treatment and continued to have seizures, no specific drugs were effective. Therefore, various kind of drugs, new or old, should be tried in sequence irrespective of the type of seizures. The seizure control was attained only in 10% (in the cases of CZP), and 17% (CLB) in localization-related epilepsy and in 9% (VPA), 12% (NZP) and 20% (ZNS) in generalized one in the refractory group. Although new drugs developed, the patients with refractory epilepsy do not tend to decrease in frequency and overall management including daily life or surgical therapy is mandatory for the children with refractory epilepsy.", 
    "107": "Therapeutic management in hepatic encephalopathy depends on its etiology as well as progression degree. Both in acute and chronic encephalopathy one should tend to establish probable causes and try to eliminate them. Cutting down on proteins in diet is one of the most important suggestions in chronic hepatic encephalopathy. In order to reduce intestinal production of ammonia, non-absorbable disaccharides (lactulose), antibiotics (neomycin) and sodium benzoate are the most commonly used. Branched chain amino acids administered orally or parenterally may be useful in improving patient's condition and restoring the balance of blood amino acids. The GABA-benzodiazepine receptor theory led to application of its antagonists, such as flumazenil, in the management of hepatic encephalopathy. However, providing a proper treatment is not easy due to unstable and often not very characteristic course of hepatic encephalopathy. What is more, clinical trials of some drugs used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy do not confirm their effectiveness.", 
    "108": "Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids that play a variety of important functions in neurons. The main purpose of this study was to determine the a/b ratio of gangliosides in different rat brain regions (cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum) after prolonged diazepam treatment. Male Wistar rats were maintained on a nutritionally adequate diet and diazepam was administered in a dose of 10 mg/kg day for 180 days. Total gangliosides were extracted according to Harth and the total ganglioside-NeuAc content was determined by Svennerholm's resorcinol method, modified by Miettinen and Takki-Luukkainen. The a/b ratio remained unchanged in rat hypothalamus, thalamus and cerebellum. It was slightly decreased in the caudate nucleus and hippocampus, but this was not statistically significant. A drastic decrease ( p<0.01) in ganglioside content, compared to control animals, was found in rat cerebral cortex. Ganglioside a/b profile did not change significantly in most of the brain regions (except in cerebral cortex), which suggests that adaptive changes occurred upon prolonged exposure to diazepam, in order to maintain the physiological ratio of ganglioside a- and b-series in distinct brain areas.", 
    "109": "Population differences in the activity of various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been demonstrated on the basis of either genetic or environmental determinants. Hispanics are a large demographic group both worldwide and within the United States; hence the possibility of differences in metabolism between one such group-Mexicans-and a European-derived population was determined with respect to CYP2E1 and CYP3A.", 
    "110": "Young healthy Mexican immigrants living in Los Angeles, Calif, who had maintained a traditional diet were compared with previously and identically studied groups of age-, sex-, and weight-matched European Americans who resided in middle Tennessee and ate a \"western\" diet (15 men and 15 women). In one study carried out in 15 women, the disposition of chlorzoxazone after an oral dose (250 mg) was compared. In the other investigation, all of the 15 subjects were men and received intravenous [(15)N(3)]-labeled midazolam (1 mg) and oral midazolam (2 mg) simultaneously to characterize the disposition of benzodiazepine in the two populations.", 
    "111": "Plasma concentration-time profiles of chlorzoxazone and its 6-hydroxy metabolite and the 0- to 24-hour urinary recovery of the latter were not different between Mexicans and European Americans. This indicates that CYP2E1 activity is similar in the two populations. Similarly, no significant intergroup differences were noted in the plasma concentration-time profiles of midazolam after either intravenous or oral administration. Accordingly, CYP3A does not appear to be different between Mexicans and European Americans.", 
    "112": "Similarity in the metabolism of chlorzoxazone between Mexicans and European Americans suggests that the risk associated with CYP2E1-mediated activation of procarcinogens is not different between these two populations. Likewise, the absence of any difference in the disposition of midazolam indicates that, from a pharmacokinetic standpoint, dosages of drugs metabolized by CYP3A need not be different between Mexicans and European Americans.", 
    "113": "Cholangiocarcinoma cells express high levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 and are markedly chemo- and radioresistant. Mitochondria have emerged as central players in apoptosis. Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family localise to the outer mitochondrial membrane and regulate mitochondrial release of apoptogenic proteins. Mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR) ligands have been shown to reverse Bcl-2 action and facilitate apoptosis.", 
    "114": "We evaluated the ability of the mBzR antagonist Pk11195 to overcome preapoptotic mitochondrial dysfunction in Egi-1 and Tfk-1, two human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1.", 
    "115": "Cells growing in culture were used to perform in vitro experiments over 48-96 hours following treatment. The cytotoxic agents used were 5 fluorouracil 10 microM and etoposide (Vp16) 10 microM, together with ultraviolet and 0.5-1 Gy x ray irradiation with or without 75 microM Pk11195. Apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction were measured at single cell resolution by flow cytometry using the mitochondrial fluorochrome DiOC6(3). Severe combined immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (SCID-NOD) mice with subcutaneous xenografts using the Egi-1 and Tfk-1 cell lines were treated with etoposide with or without addition of Pk11195 over a 72 hour period during which time the xenograft growth patterns were monitored.", 
    "116": "In vitro, the effect of Pk11195 on induction of apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells following stimulation by chemotherapy or radiotherapy was found to be both time and dose dependent, with Pk11195 increasing rates of apoptosis by 50-95%. Intraperitoneal administration of Pk11195 in combination with Vp16 was found to increase the growth inhibiting effects of Vp16 on xenografts during the treatment phase. PK11195 75 microM on its own had no intrinsic cytotoxic efficacy.", 
    "117": "This is the first study to demonstrate that functional antagonism of coexpressed Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 proteins using the mBzR antagonist Pk11195 can facilitate apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma following chemotherapy and radiotherapy.", 
    "118": "The increase in resistance of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to currently available drugs demands the development of new antimalarial agents. In this quest, we have found that ligands to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor such as flurazepam, an agonist of the benzodiazepine family, and PK11195, an antagonist derived from isoquinoline, were active against Plasmodium falciparum. These two compounds effectively and rapidly inhibited parasite growth in vitro, irrespective of parasite resistance to chloroquine and mefloquine. Treatment with both drugs induced a sharp and consistent decline in parasitemia, a complete inhibition of parasite replication, and the destruction of parasites within the host red blood cells. Using electron microscopy, we showed that dramatic morphological changes, involving swollen endoplasmic reticulum and the reduction of hemozoin, were consistent with parasite death. The potent activities of flurazepam and PK11195 were also evaluated for antagonist or synergistic effects with currently used antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine. Moreover, flurazepam was found to be active against Toxoplasma gondii, another member of the phylum Apicomplexa. Taken together, our results indicated that benzodiazepines could be considered promising candidates in the treatment of both malaria and toxoplasmosis."
