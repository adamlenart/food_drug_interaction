We used the auditory evoked potential index (AEPindex) as the input signal of this system to validate it as a true measure of depth of anaesthesia. Auditory evoked potentials were acquired and processed in real time to provide the AEPindex. The AEPindex was used in a proportional integral (PI) controller to determine the target blood concentration of propofol required to induce and maintain general anaesthesia automatically. We studied 100 spontaneously breathing patients. The mean AEPindex before induction of anaesthesia was 73.5 (SD 17.6), during surgical anaesthesia 37.8 (4.5) and at recovery of consciousness 89.7 (17.9). Twenty-two patients required assisted ventilation before incision. After incision, ventilation was assisted in four of these 22 patients for more than 5 min. There was no incidence of intraoperative awareness and all patients were prepared to have the same anaesthetic in future. Movement interfering with surgery was minimal. Cardiovascular stability and overall control of anaesthesia were satisfactory.", 
    "1": "Anxiety and pain even in minor procedures are still great problems in pediatrics, not least in pediatric oncology. Conscious sedation is indicated when other means to overcome a child's fear fail. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intranasal administration of midazolam given before insertion of a needle in a subcutaneously implanted central venous port could reduce anxiety, discomfort, pain, and procedure problems.", 
    "2": "Forty-three children with cancer participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in which nasal administration of midazolam spray,.2 mg/kg body weight, was compared with placebo. Children, parents, and nurses completed a visual analog scale questionnaire to evaluate efficacy.", 
    "3": "Parents and nurses reported reduced anxiety, discomfort, and procedure problems for children in the midazolam group and would prefer the same medication at next procedure. They also reported pain reduction. Children reported reduced anxiety and procedure problems but reduction of pain and discomfort was not significant. No serious or unexpected side effects occurred. Nasal discomfort was the most common side effect (17/38 approximately 45%) and the primary reason for dropouts (8/43 approximately 19%). Anxiety varied with age but not with gender. When anxiety increased, the differences between midazolam and placebo increased.", 
    "4": "Nasal midazolam spray offers relief to children anxious about procedures, such as insertion of a needle in a subcutaneously implanted intravenous port, venous blood sampling, venous cannulation, etc. Its use, however, may be limited by nasal discomfort in some patients for whom rectal and oral routes might be alternatives.", 
    "5": "This paper reports changes in substance use behaviours at 1-year follow-up, and investigates the relationship between time in treatment and observed outcomes. A total of 408 clients were interviewed at intake to 23 residential treatment programmes, and 286 (70%) of these were interviewed at 1 year. Substantial improvements were found in terms of abstinence from opiates, psychostimulants and benzodiazepines. At 1 year, half of the clients were abstinent from heroin. Reductions in injecting, sharing injecting equipment, heavy drinking and criminal behaviour were found. Critical treatment thresholds were identified using multiple logistic regression analyses. Longer stays in treatment were predictive of better 1 year outcomes.", 
    "6": "[11C]flumazenil (FMZ) imaged with PET allows the computation of parametric images of both tracer influx (K1) and volume of distribution (VD). The VD images, which allow visualization of a quantitative measure of benzodiazepine receptor binding, are reported to have high sensitivity and specificity for the delineation of epileptic foci. However, the clinical feasibility of this method is compromised by the necessity of arterial blood sampling. We therefore compared the performance of parametric VD images against simple FMZ activity images for the detection of neocortical epileptic foci.", 
    "7": "FMZ PET data from 7 children with extratemporal lobe epilepsy (mean age [+/- SD] 9.8+/-4.4 y) and 6 healthy adult volunteers (mean age [+/- SD] 40+/-8 y) were analyzed using a semiautomated analysis algorithm. FMZ activity images and parametric VD images were analyzed for asymmetry with cutoff thresholds of 8%, 10% and 12%.", 
    "8": "The time frame between 10 and 20 min after injection represented overall the best agreement between FMZ activity and VD images independent of the threshold. The normal asymmetry in VD images was determined as 6.4%+/-1.4% and was significantly higher in the FMZ activity images (7.6%+/-1.4%, P = 0.001). Increasing the cutoff threshold resulted in a significant decrease in the area defined as abnormal in both the VD and the FMZ activity images. Abnormalities defined in FMZ activity images identified additional brain regions as abnormal at the 8% threshold, but there was good agreement with VD images at the 10% asymmetry threshold. In those regions where abnormalities in VD and FMZ activity images were not matched, the asymmetry indices obtained from K1 images were significantly higher than those derived from the VD images (P = 0.01).", 
    "9": "Differences between VD and activity images above the 8% threshold are mainly due to K1. Abnormalities defined in FMZ activity images using a threshold of 10% agree well with those obtained from parametric VD images, indicating that activity images obtained from the time frame of 10-20 min are essentially equivalent to VD images with regard to detection of regions of abnormality for seizure focus localization.", 
    "10": "The past decade has witnessed the introduction of several significant innovations to combat POV, particularly the introduction of serotonin antagonists and the use of combinations of drugs for analgesia and control of POV. Based on current knowledge, the anaesthetic plan for a patient with a previous history of severe PONV and undergoing a procedure known to be associated with a high incidence of this problem should include premedication with a benzodiazepine and/or clonidine and the preferential use of regional anaesthetic techniques. If general anaesthesia is essential, anaesthetists should consider the use of propofol for both induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, together with avoidance of nitrous oxide, opioids and neuromuscular antagonists. Pain control is extremely important, and a peripheral regional block should be used if possible. A combination of prophylactic antiemetics such as dexamethasone, a 5-HT3 antagonist and an antiemetic of a different class (e.g. perphenazine or dimenhydrinate) should be administered. Non-pharmacological measures such as acupressure and suggestion should also be considered, together with nursing measures to avoid sudden movement from one position to another during the postoperative period. A quiet environment, adequate i.v. fluids and not forcing the patient to drink before discharge all contribute to decreased emesis. It is possible that the advent of a new class of antiemetic agents, the NKI antagonists, may have major effects on the incidence of this complication. Drugs in this group differ from other currently available drugs in having the ability to effectively block the emetic response to many stimuli in experimental animals. Postoperative vomiting remains a significant problem, resulting in patient suffering and prolonged recovery from anaesthesia. Our aim should be to eliminate this complication in all children who require surgery. It should not be considered merely as the 'big, little problem'.",

    "12": "In this article the methodological basis for our knowledge within the field of driving under the influence of non-alcohol drugs is reviewed. The experimental and epidemiological studies on drugs in relation to driving do not constitute a complete basis for conclusions to be drawn, but give at the present state nevertheless a platform to indicate increased hazard connected with the use of several drugs. It appears that the main problem with respect to therapeutic use of medicinal drugs is experienced with benzodiazepines (BZDs) and related drugs, and to a lesser extent with opioids and antidepressants. Antihistamine use does not appear to be a serious problem. The major problem within the field of drugged driving as it emerges today in the US and Europe is the high dose use (abuse) of BZDs and related drugs, opioids and illicit drugs such as cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine and related drugs with accompanying danger to traffic safety. Methods determining clinical drug effects in people combined with measurements of drug blood concentrations seem to constitute the best basis for evaluation of \"influence\". New methods to detect drugged drivers are under development, with saliva tests presently being the most promising. Legislation in the field can be of the \"zero tolerance\" type or the \"impairment\" type; combinations of these principles might well turn out to be the most efficient. Detection of drugged driving is presently, in relation to population size, most frequent in Norway, a country with not too pronounced drug problems, indicating a large potential for future detection of drugged driving in other countries. The prevention of drugged driving, especially in the drug-abusing group which has a high recidivism rate, is a challenge for future policy in this field.", 
    "13": "We carried out a meta-analysis of data for 950 depressed patients from all double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative studies of moclobemide against imipramine. The aim of the analysis was to determine: 1 if the two antidepressants reduce anxiety symptoms as effectively as symptoms of depression; 2. if there are differences in the anti-anxiety effects; and 3. if the severity of anxiety symptoms influences the outcome of treatment.", 
    "14": "The analysis was done in sub-groups of patients classified according to different definitions of anxiety and to the degree (mild, moderate, severe) of psychic and somatic anxiety present at baseline. The definitions and the criteria for the severity of anxiety were derived from the HAMD-17 anxiety item scores (items 10 and 11) and HAMD-17 anxiety sub-scales (ANXP and SOMA). The application of various definitions of anxiety (single-item and composite sub-scale scores) served to check the consistency, reproducibility and generalizability of the results. The criteria of efficacy and of the outcome of treatment, which were set in advance, were either: 50% reduction of the HAMD anxiety sub-scale; or percentage of global improvement (CGEA, very much and much) at the end of treatment (4 weeks).", 
    "15": "The results showed that moclobemide and imipramine are equally effective in reducing psychic and somatic anxiety in depressed patients, independent of the severity of anxiety or how it was defined. The criterion of 50% decrease of anxiety scores (at week 4) was consistently reached by 60-70% of patients in all drug sub-groups. The time course of effects on anxiety symptoms was similar with both drugs. It ran parallel to the regression of depression, with significant improvement of anxiety symptoms by week 2 on all measures. The frequency of benzodiazepine (BDZ) co-administration was not systematically correlated with the severity of anxiety. Moreover, co-prescription of BDZ did not change the outcome of drug treatment, with respect either to anxiety symptoms or global therapeutic efficacy. In placebo groups, significant negative interactions were found between severity of anxiety and the efficacy of treatment, which decreased with increased anxiety. The incidence of adverse events with moclobemide was barely higher than in the placebo group. Insomnia (4.9%) was the only adverse event significantly higher with moclobemide than with other treatments. Drop-out rates in drug groups were similar (27%) and unrelated to the severity of anxiety. In the placebo group, drop-outs were significantly higher than in drug groups (39%), and were positively correlated with the severity of anxiety.", 
    "16": "The results of this study indicate that anxiety symptoms in depressed patients respond similarly to moclobemide or imipramine and that the severity of these symptoms (or the co-prescription of benzodiazepine) has no influence on either the magnitude of anti-anxiety effects or on overall outcome.

    "18": "Although frequently investigated in the general population, the epidemiology of insomnia complaints and their treatment have received little attention in general practice. This study recruited patients > or =15 years of age, consecutively, from 127 general practitioners in France. The physicians collected data from 11,810 of their patients, of whom 55.5% were women. Insomnia complaints were reported by 26.2% (25.4% to 27%) of the sample and use of sleep-promoting medication by 10.1% (9.7% to 10.7%). About 47% of the prescribed drugs used were anxiolytics and 45% hypnotics. Most consumers took sleep-enhancing drugs on a daily and long-term basis and most reported that the medication improved their quality of sleep. However, few distinctions emerged between elderly drug-taking insomniacs and elderly nontreated insomniacs with respect to the various dimensions of sleep. Results underscore the persistent general tendency among French general practitioners to overprescribe anxiolytics for the treatment of insomnia complaints and that they do so on a long-term basis, despite the findings of numerous studies showing that benzodiazepines are ineffective in the treatment of sleep complaints over the long term.",

    "27": "The advantages of standardized multimodal image analysis are demonstrated in a case of symptomatic tremor after basilar thrombosis. Functionally and structurally lesioned areas were mapped in Talairach space using 3-D MRI, cerebral FDG-PET and O-15-H2O-PET. Structural lesions were found in the left midbrain, thalamus, putamen and cerebellar areas. Voxel-based statistics in comparison to a normal data base revealed hypometabolism in the left thalamus, left red nucleus, left cerebellar hemisphere including dentate nucleus and in the left inferior olivary nucleus. The O-15-H2O-PET investigation revealed metabolic uncoupling along the rubroolivocerebellar loop. Given the delicate anatomy of the structures involved, image registration and standardized image analysis techniques are essential for a synoptic multimodality analysis of morphological and functional pathology and should generally be used for cerebral PET investigations.", 
    "28": "Because of inadequate response to or intolerable side effects of oral medication, nine patients with segmental, generalized, and focal myoclonus were treated with intramuscular botulinum toxin type A. All patients were evaluated with neuroimaging, routine and limb-monitored electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potentials and appropriate biochemical studies. Patients were aged 2 to 22 years, with duration of myoclonus from 1 month to 10 years. Multiple medication trials included antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines, tryptophan, L-dopa/carbidopa, baclofen, and dantrolene. Patients were injected with botulinum toxin in their affected area with electromyographic guidance to affected muscles with different doses (8 to 20 units/kg), except two patients who were injected with 32 and 45 units/kg, respectively, at 4- to 8-month intervals. One patient did not complete botulinum toxin treatment because of subjective weakness, although there were virtually no side effects reported in patients completing therapy. Patients reported a dramatic reduction in painful myoclonus. In addition, patients exhibited improved functional skills, as demonstrated by markedly improved use of affected extremities and improvements in ambulation. One patient, who was nonambulatory prior to treatment, was able to walk afterward. Long-term benefits could be related to higher dosage used or negative feedback effect.", 
    "29": "When performing IVCS, one must never forget the primary goal of providing patient comfort without compromising cardiopulmonary function or the patient's ability to react purposely to verbal commands and physical stimuli. When it is anticipated that required sedation will lead to loss of protective airway reflexes, such patients require a greater level of care than exists with IVCS. Deep sedation is a complication of IVCS and must be avoided. In deep sedation, one creates a state of depressed consciousness from which the patient is not easily aroused, accompanied by a partial or complete loss of protective reflexes, including the ability to maintain a patent airway independently and respond purposely to physical stimuli or verbal commands. In keeping this goal in mind, understanding those situations in which patients are at increased risk should be emphasized. In general, the elderly show increased sensitivity to the drugs used for IVCS, so the dose and frequency of administration should be reduced. In addition, patients with COPD appear to be more sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and benzodiazepines, especially when used in combination. Patients with low serum albumin concentrations show increased sensitivity to drugs that are highly protein bound such as thiopental because more free drug is available for therapeutic effect. To avoid hypotention, caution should be exercised in patients with poor left ventricular function or borderline volume status before the administration of IVCS. Understanding the metabolism and excretion of the agents used for IVCS is critical to avoid oversedation. Drugs such as diazepam, morphine, meperidine, and fentanyl have active metabolites, so the potential for drug accumulation and prolonged effect certainly exists. Patients with renal disease are particularly susceptible to CNS toxicity from normeperidine because of the accumulation of the active metabolite. Drugs like fentanyl, although short acting, have prolonged activity as a result of seepage of stored drug back into the systemic circulation. In contrast, thiopental is metabolized to water-soluble inactive metabolites. Careful titration to effect with dosage adjustments will avoid unnecessary oversedation with resultant respiratory and cardiovascular complications. Time should elapse between repeat doses to allow peak effects to occur. In addition, potential drug interactions that can prolong the effects should be recognized. Examples of the latter are the interaction between cimetidine and diazepam or the protease inhibitors and the benzodiazepines, in which the potential exists for excessive and prolonged sedation. The use of the narcotic antagonist naloxone and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil should be scrutinized because they should be reserved for the unusual situation in which excessive cardiopulmonary depression occurs. Maintenance of a patent airway and stable cardiovascular function in a patient who can respond to verbal commands and physical stimuli is the primary goal of IVCS. With the agents discussed in this chapter, this goal is easily obtained, keeping the principles just mentioned in mind with all the appropriate monitoring guidelines discussed elsewhere in this text.", 
    "30": "A 5-month-old 22-kg (48.4-lb) sexually intact male Collie was examined after ingesting a moxidectin-containing deworming medication. The dog was comatose and had respiratory arrest after progressively worsening lethargy, ataxia, and seizures. Exposure was confirmed by isolation of moxidectin from a biopsy specimen of adipose tissue, using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy methods. Treatment included use of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, activated charcoal and cathartic administered enterally, nutrients administered via nasogastric tube, and intensive supportive care. The dog was weaned from a ventilator on day 6 after ingestion and was discharged on day 10. The dog was considered clinically normal during examination 24 days after ingestion. On the basis of the dog reported here and toxicologic data provided by the manufacturer of the deworming product, some Collies may have increased susceptibility to products containing high doses of moxidectin.",

    "32": "Eighteen unrelated adult men were recruited for the study from a total of 101 healthy Chinese volunteers who had been screened for CYP2C19 phenotype and genotype. All subjects received a single oral dose (5 mg) of diazepam, and the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were compared in six ml homozygotes (ml/ml), six ml heterozygotes (wt/ml), and six wild-type homozygotes (wt/wt).", 
    "33": "The plasma elimination half-life values of diazepam (84.0 +/- 13.7 hours) and desmethyldiazepam (176.0 +/- 28.9 hours) in subjects of ml/ml were significantly longer than those (62.9 +/- 9.8 hours for diazepam; 132.1 +/- 24.9 hours for desmethyldiazepam; both P < .01) in subjects of wt/ml or those (20.0 +/- 10.8 hours for diazepam; 99.2.+/- 21.7 hours for desmethyldiazepam; both P < .01) in subjects of wt/wt. A significant difference in the corresponding half-life values existed between the wt/ml and wt/wt subjects (P < .01). As expected, the slowest mean clearance of diazepam was observed in the ml/ml subjects (2.8 +/- 0.9 mL/min) and the fastest in the wt/wt subjects (19.5 +/- 9.8 mL/min), with the wt/ml heterozygotes having an intermediate value (7.2 +/- 2.6 mL/min).",

    "35": "Although the neocortex has generally been considered resistant to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), we have recently shown that LTP can be reliably induced in the freely moving rat provided that the stimulation sessions are spaced and repeated. Here, we report that the induction of LTP in this preparation can be modulated by both GABAergic agonism and antagonism. The delivery of stimulation trains in the presence of the GABA(A) agonist diazepam blocked the induction of neocortical LTP, while the GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin slowed the development of potentiation. When animals that had previously received high-frequency stimulation combined with diazepam were repotentiated, they showed greater resistance to LTP induction than animals that had received diazepam alone. These data suggest that the inhibitory circuits themselves may have potentiated. The demonstration that diazepam blocks neocortical LTP provides further support for the notion that LTP plays a role in memory formation.", 
    "36": "Twenty-seven patients with generalized anxiety or panic disorder participated in a 6-week outpatient study. Participants received capsules containing either alprazolam or placebo and were free to choose between them for anxiety treatment. Measures of drug use included alprazolam preference, amount, and frequency of use. Alprazolam clearly was preferred over placebo; however, there were large between-subjects differences in the amount of medication used. A variety of demographic, drug history, personality, mood, and expectational variables were examined for correlation with medication use. Findings indicated that a substantial amount of variance in medication use could be explained by patients' intake characteristics. Findings also suggested that the tendency to consume capsules frequently may signal a greater risk factor for dependence than does drug preference in and of itself.", 
    "37": "The effects of flumazenil on the latencies and amplitudes of visual event-related potentials (ERPs), number-connection test (NCT) and visual and auditory reaction times (VRT and ART) were evaluated in ten patients with cirrhosis without clinically overt encephalopathy (HE). Delayed latencies of the ERP component P3a and/or P3b were found in three patients and the time to complete NCT was prolonged in two other patients. Changes in the latencies and amplitudes of the ERP components (N200, P3a and P3b) during 40 min following infusion of flumazenil (1 mg) and placebo were similar. Results of the three psychometric tests did not change significantly after either flumazenil or placebo infusion. Eight of the ten patients felt more alert for several minutes after the administration of flumazenil, whereas no patient experienced any change of perception after infusion of placebo. Prolongation of the latencies of P3a and P3b may be a component of the syndrome of subclinical HE. However, these neuro-electrophysiological abnormalities in cirrhotic patients may not be attributable to increased brain levels of natural benzodiazepines.", 
    "38": "Although the anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome was first described in 1950, confusion still abounds regarding the syndrome. The triad of fever, rash and internal organ involvement occurring 1 to 8 weeks after exposure to an anticonvulsant heralds this rare (1 in 1,000 to 10,000 exposures) but serious reaction. Aromatic anticonvulsants [phenytoin, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone) and carbamazepine] are the most frequently involved drugs; however, there have also been several cases of anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome associated with lamotrigine. Fever, in conjunction with malaise and pharyngitis, is often the first sign. This is followed by a rash which can range from a simple exanthem to toxic epidermal necrolysis. Internal organ involvement usually involves the liver, although other organs such as the kidney, CNS or lungs may be involved. Hypothyroidism may be a complication in these patients approximately 2 months after occurrence of symptoms. The aromatic anticonvulsants are metabolised to hydroxylated aromatic compounds, such as arene oxides. If detoxification of this toxic metabolite is insufficient, the toxic metabolite may bind to cellular macromolecules causing cell necrosis or a secondary immunological response. Cross-reactivity among the aromatic anticonvulsants may be as high as 75%. In addition, there is a familial tendency to hypersensitivity to anticonvulsants. Discontinuation of the anticonvulsant is essential in patients who develop symptoms compatible with anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. A minimum battery of laboratory tests, such as liver transaminases, complete blood count and urinalysis and serum creatinine, should be performed. Corticosteroids are usually administered if symptoms are severe. Patients with anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome should avoid all aromatic anticonvulsants; benzodiazepines, valproic acid (sodium valproate) or one of the newer anticonvulsants can be used for seizure control. However, valproic acid should be used very cautiously in the presence of hepatitis. There is no evidence that lamotrigine cross-reacts with aromatic anticonvulsants. In addition, family counselling is a vital component of patient management.", 
    "39": "Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone hypnosedative that is chemically unrelated to the benzodiazepines but nevertheless potentiates gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neuronal inhibition, and has demonstrated proven efficacy and good tolerability in the treatment of insomnia over 15 years of use. Zopiclone is indicated for short term use, and should not be prescribed for more than 4 weeks. This review compares the efficacy of zopiclone with that of a number of commonly used short-, medium- and long-acting benzodiazepines. Zopiclone at dosages of 7.5 mg/day has demonstrated efficacy equivalent and in some cases greater to that of flurazepam 30 mg/day, nitrazepam 5 mg/day, flunitrazepam 1 to 2 mg/day, temazepam 20 mg/day, triazolam 0.125 to 0.5 mg/day and midazolam 15 mg/day. Zopiclone-treated patients reported themselves to be less impaired by daytime sedation than patients treated with the medium- and long-acting hypnosedatives flurazepam, nitrazepam and flunitrazepam. Zopiclone and temazepam showed similar effects on daytime behaviour while zopiclone appeared to have somewhat better effects on daytime well-being than the short-acting triazolam and midazolam. There has been no clinical comparison with the frequently used medium-acting benzodiazepines lormetazepam and brotizolam and the imidazopyridine hypnosedative zolpidem. Data from clinical trials, pooled analyses and postmarketing surveillance including over 30,000 patients showed that with the exception of bitter taste (reported by <10% of zopiclone recipients), the tolerability profile of zopiclone is similar to that of placebo. Clinical trials found no evidence for significant rebound insomnia and indicated that the risk of withdrawal reactions with therapeutic doses of zopiclone is very low. In addition, to date, dependency appears very low, although abuse potential should be considered following a history of addiction or psychiatric illness. Evaluation of the accumulated evidence from over 2.5 billion units dispensed in more than 30 countries indicates that zopiclone is effective, well tolerated and an excellent alternative to benzodiazepines in the short term treatment of insomnia.",

All agents have a favorable side effect profile with cautions exercised in the use of benzodiazepines and chemical dependency. Long-term outcome may be better with nonbenzodiazepine agents. Buspirone efficacy studies have not been performed in patients diagnosed with GAD using current criteria.

The contralateral cortical after-discharge duration in the dipotassium clorazepate-treated group was significantly shorter than the after-discharge duration in the amygdala in the first seven stimulations, whereas it was significantly shorter only in the first three stimulations in the control group, indicating that dipotassium clorazepate suppressed the spread of seizure activity from focus to contralateral cortex. Dipotassium clorazepate suppressed amygdaloid-kindled seizures at 2 and 5 mg/kg, while 1 mg/kg or more suppressed hippocampal-kindled seizures. Thus, differences in effective dosages in both amygdaloid- and hippocampal-kindled seizures may suggest a difference in the neuronal mechanisms involved in this kindling.", 
    "49": "Behavioral effects of diazepam were studied in rats responding in different daily sessions using different operant chambers and manipulanda. In one experiment, key pressing was maintained in a first session under a 40-response fixed-ratio schedule; lever pressing was maintained in a second session under a 40-response fixed-ratio schedule; and a third session consisted of a multiple schedule comprising both key and lever pressing maintained under a 40-response fixed-ratio schedule. In a second experiment, the first session consisted of a multiple schedule with both key and lever pressing maintained under a 40-response fixed-ratio schedule and the second session consisted of lever pressing maintained under a 40-response fixed-ratio schedule. After studying effects of widely spaced injections of diazepam (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) on responding for each separate schedule, animals received 1.7 mg/kg/day diazepam in order to study chronic effects of the diazepam on behavior among the different schedule-conditions. In both experiments, tolerance to rate-decreasing effects of diazepam in a particular schedule component did not extend to any other schedule component when the manipulandum or chamber was different, but did extend to other schedule components when the manipulandum or chamber was the same. These results suggest that behavioral effects of chronically administered diazepam were influenced not only by pharmacologic processes, but also by learned relationships among its interoceptive effects, reinforcement contingencies, and particular behavioral environments.", 
    "50": "Cat odor-induced hiding was examined in rats (Rattus norvegicus) using an apparatus with a \"hide box\" at one end and a piece of a worn cat collar at the other end. Rats spent most of their time hiding on exposure to the cat collar, but this response gradually habituated over repeated daily exposures. Hiding was reversed by administering the anxiolytic drug midazolam (0.375 mg/kg). Rats showed increased anxiety on the elevated plus-maze after exposure to the collar. This response was absent in habituated rats, suggesting that habituation of hiding reflects decreased odor-induced anxiety. It was established that rats located in the hide box of the apparatus might not have detected the odor of the cat collar placed at the other end of the apparatus. This implies that habituation occurs after relatively modest levels of odor exposure. Overall, the results cast some doubt on claims that predatory odors in rats are akin to phobic stimuli in humans.", 
    "51": "Effective medical treatment for impulsive aggression and several impulse control disorders is needed. Disinhibited, impulsive behavior of e.g. murderers, arsonists, suicidal patients, and patients suffering from antisocial personality or substance abuse disorders has been associated with signs of a deficiency in brain serotonin (5-HT) systems. Depletion of brain 5-HT consistently produces disinhibition and aggression also in experimental animals. The present series of experiments using a modified Vogel's conflict test indicates that the disinhibitory behavior of 5-HT-lesioned rats can be reversed by the commonly used opiate receptor antagonist naloxone at doses (0.1-5.0 mg/kg, s.c.) that do not significantly affect behavior in sham-lesioned controls. Moreover, this effect of naloxone, which resembles that previously observed after administration of negative modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A))/benzodiazepine receptor complexes, was reversed by a low inert dose (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) of amobarbital. Furthermore, both naloxone (5.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and Ro 15-4513 (1.0 mg/kg, p.o.; a partial inverse agonist at benzodiazepine receptors) significantly decreased the number of attacks and the time spent in aggressive acts in 5,7-DHT-lesioned male residents. These results taken together with previous behavioral and neurochemical data suggest that the behavioral effects of naloxone observed here may involve an antagonistic action at brain gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A))/benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Thus, naloxone, its stable analogue naltrexone or other weak negative modulators of brain GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes may represent a new pharmacological principle for the treatment of impulse control disorders.", 
    "52": "Repeated administration of an opioid in the presence of specific environmental cues can induce tolerance specific to that setting (associative tolerance). Prolonged or repeated administration of an opioid without consistent contextual pairing yields non-associative tolerance. Here we demonstrate that cholecystokinin acting at the cholecystokinin-B receptor is required for associative but not non-associative morphine tolerance. Morphine given in the morphine-associated context increased Fos-like immunoreactivity in the lateral amygdala and hippocampal area CA1. Microinjection of the cholecystokinin B antagonist L-365,260 into the amygdala blocked associative tolerance. These results indicate that cholecystokinin acting in the amygdala is necessary for associative tolerance to morphine's analgesic effect.",

Guinea pigs, implanted with electrodes to record cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, were pretreated with pyridostigmine Br (0.026 mg/kg, i.m.) and 30 min later challenged with 2 x LD50 soman (56 microg/kg, s.c.) followed 1 min later by treatment with atropine SO4 (2 mg/kg, i.m.) and pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl; 25 mg/kg, i.m.). All guinea pigs developed sustained seizure activity following this treatment. Dose-effect curves were determined for the ability of each drug to terminate seizure activity when anticonvulsant treatment was given either 5 or 40 min after seizure onset. Body weight gain and recovery of behavioral performance of a previously trained one-way avoidance task were measured after exposure. With the exception of atropine, all anticholinergic drugs were effective at lower doses than diazepam in terminating seizures when given 5 min after seizure onset; benactyzine, procyclidine and aprophen terminated seizures most rapidly while scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, biperiden, and diazepam were significantly slower. When given 40 min after seizure onset, diazepam was the most potent compound tested, followed by scopolamine, benactyzine and biperiden; atropine was not effective when tested 40 min after seizure onset. For diazepam, the time to terminate the seizure was the same whether it was given at the 5- or 40-min delay.

    "63": "The progesterone metabolite 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-P or allopregnanolone) is a potent positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors. Although it is well documented that chronic ethanol (EtOH) administration produces cross-tolerance to the positive modulatory effect of benzodiazepines and GABA at GABA(A) receptors, recent findings suggest that sensitivity to 3alpha,5alpha-P is enhanced during EtOH withdrawal. In addition, EtOH-naive inbred strains of mice, which differ in EtOH withdrawal severity (DBA/2 > C57BL/6), had marked differences in behavioral sensitivity to 3alpha,5alpha-P. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice would be differentially sensitive to several of the pharmacological effects of 3alpha,5alpha-P during EtOH withdrawal. Male mice were exposed to EtOH vapor or air for 72 h. During withdrawal from EtOH, animals were injected with 3alpha,5alpha-P (0, 3.2, 10, or 17 mg/kg i.p.) and tested for activity and anxiolysis on the elevated plus maze, muscle relaxation, ataxia, and seizure protection following pentylenetetrazol. Sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effect of 3alpha,5alpha-P was enhanced during EtOH withdrawal in B6, but not D2 mice. In contrast, sensitivity to the muscle relaxant effects of 3alpha,5alpha-P was reduced in EtOH-withdrawing B6 and D2 mice, with a suggestion of decreased sensitivity to the anxiolytic effect of 3alpha,5alpha-P during EtOH withdrawal in B6. These results suggest that sensitization to the anticonvulsant effect of 3alpha,5alpha-P during EtOH withdrawal does not generalize across all genotypes nor does it generalize to all of the pharmacological effects of 3alpha,5alpha-P.", 
    "64": "A novel series of N-substituted 4-ureido-5,7-dichloro-quinolines were synthesized to contain pharmacophores directed at voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSNaCs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These compounds were shown to act in a use-dependent manner as antagonists of VSNaCs and to act as selective competitive antagonists at the strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site of NMDA receptors. These agents had little or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors, other glutamate receptors, or sites other than the glycine site on the NMDA receptor, and did not block voltage-sensitive calcium channels in vitro. In vivo, the compounds were active in preventing or reducing the signs and symptoms of neurohyperexcitability and had anxiolytic properties. Unlike benzodiazepines, N-substituted 4-ureido-5, 7-dichloro-quinolines showed little interaction with the sedative effects of ethanol, but were effective in controlling ethanol withdrawal seizures. The combined actions of these compounds on VSNaCs and NMDA receptors also impart properties to these compounds that are important for preventing and reducing excitotoxic neurodegeneration, but these compounds lack the undesirable side effects of other agents used for these purposes.", 
    "65": "The authors report preliminary findings on the effect of the new generation antiepileptic drug (AED) felbamate (FBM) on steady state plasma concentrations of clobazam (CLB), a benzodiazepine (frequently used as add-on therapy in patients with refractory epilepsy) and its active metabolite n-desmethyl-clobazam (N-CLB). The authors prospectively collected plasma samples from 66 children and adults with epilepsy receiving chronic CLB therapy. On the basis of concomitant AEDs, patients were divided into three subgroups otherwise comparable for age and weight-adjusted daily dose of CLB: group A (n = 22), receiving CLB monotherapy or CLB plus AEDs without inducing properties of cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism, namely valproic acid (VPA) or lamotrigine (LTG); group B (n = 28), receiving CLB plus AED inducer polytherapy (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), even associated with VPA (n = 9) or LTG (n = 12); group C (n = 16), receiving CLB plus FBM, associated with AED inducers, VPA or LTG. Level to weight-adjusted dose ratio (L/D) of CLB in groups B and C was twofold lower compared to group A (p < 0.001). L/D of N-CLB was twofold higher in group B and fivefold in group C compared to group A (p < 0.00 1). The metabolite-to-parent drug ratio shifted from a median value of 2.8 in group A to 13 in group B, and up to 29 in patients receiving polytherapy with FBM (p < 0.001). These data confirm previous reports of a significant increase in CLB clearance in patients receiving AED inducers, leading to an accumulation of its main metabolite. They also provide novel evidence of a further marked increase in N-CLB plasma concentrations in patients receiving FBM cotherapy. From a clinical point of view, this finding should be kept in mind in explaining possible toxicity in patients on complex AED polytherapy. Furthermore, knowledge of the in vivo interaction between CLB and FBM could help in identifying the CYP isoforms involved in the metabolism of both CLB and N-CLB.", 
    "66": "A novel QSAR approach based on quantum similarity measures was developed and tested in this paper. This approach consists of replacing the usual physicochemical parameters employed in QSAR analysis, such as octanol-water partition coefficient or Hammett sigma constant, by appropriate quantum chemical descriptors. The methodological basis for this substitution is found in recent theoretical studies [J. Comput. Chem. 1998, 19, 1575-1583, J. Comput. -Aided Mol. Des. 1999, 13, 259-270], in which it was demonstrated that both molecular hydrophobic character and electronic substituent effect can be modeled by appropriately chosen quantum self-similarity measures (QS-SM). The most important aim of this study was to prove that selected QS-SM descriptors can be advantageously used in empirical QSAR analysis instead of classical descriptors. For this purpose several QSAR correlations are proposed, in which empirical descriptors such as Hammett sigma constants or log P values are replaced by the appropriate QS-SM. These examples involve: (i) a set of benzenesulfonamides which bind to human carbonic anhydrase, (ii) a set of benzylamines as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme trypsin, and (iii) a set of indole derivatives which are benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist site ligands. Simple linear QSAR models were developed in order to obtain mathematical relationships between the biological activity and the pertinent quantum chemical descriptors. The validity of the obtained QSAR models is supported by comparison of the observed and predicted values of the biological activity and by a statistical analysis based on a randomization test.",

These hybrids 22-25 contain from one to four pyrrole units, respectively. To investigate sequence selectivity and stability of drug/DNA complexes, DNase I footprinting and arrested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed on human c-myc oncogene, estrogen receptor gene, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR) gene sequences. The antiproliferative activity of the hybrids has been tested in vitro on human myeloid leukemia K562 and T-lymphoid Jurkat cell lines and compared to antiproliferative effects of the natural product distamycin A 1, its tetrapyrrole homologue 17, DC 81 (4), and the PBD methyl ester 12. The results obtained demonstrate that the hybrids 22-25 exhibit different DNA-binding activity with respect to both distamycin A 1 and PBD 12. In addition, a direct relationship was found between number of pyrrole rings present in the hybrids 22-25 and stability of drug/DNA complexes. With respect to antiproliferative effects, it was found that the increase in the length of the polypyrrole backbone leads to an increase of in vitro antiproliferative effects, i.e., the hybrid 25 containing the four pyrroles is more active than 22, 23, and 24 both against K562 and Jurkat cell lines.", 
    "68": "The effects of HIV-1 Tat protein on mitochondria membrane permeability and apoptosis were analysed in lymphoid cells. In this report we show that stable-transfected HIV-Tat cells are primed to undergo apoptosis upon serum withdrawal. This effect was observed in both the Jhan T cell line and the K562 cells, the latter expressing the bcr-abl chimeric gene, which confers resistance to apoptosis induced by different stimuli. Using a cytofluorimetric approach we have determined that serum withdrawal induces a disruption of the transmembrane mitochondrial potential (Deltapsim) followed by an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent DNA nuclear loss in K562-Tat cells but not in the K562-pcDNA cell line. These pre-apoptotic events were associated with the cleavage of the caspase-3, while the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bax proteins was not affected by the presence of Tat. Regardless of the steady state of the Bax protein, we found that in both K562 and K562-Tat cells, this protein is located in the nucleus, but after serum withdrawal its localization was mainly in the cytoplasm. The activity of caspase-3 detected in K562-Tat cells after serum withdrawal paralleled with the mitochondria permeability transition. Nevertheless, in Jhan-Tat cells the inhibition of this caspase with the specific inhibitor, z-DEVD-cmk, did not affect the disruption of the mitochondria potential induced by serum withdrawal. Interestingly, we found that HIV-Tat protein accumulates at the mitochondria in the K562-Tat cells cultured under low serum conditions, and this mitochondrial localization correlated with the Deltapsim disruption detected in these cells. In addition, HIV-1 Tat protein synergies with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, in the induction of apoptosis in both Jhan and K562 cells. Thus, HIV-1 Tat protein may induce apoptosis by a mechanism that involves mitochondrial PT and may contribute to the lymphocyte depletion seen in AIDS patients.",

While they are also expressed in the granular cell layer in the cerebellum, their function is unknown. In a first step to verify the physiological roles of mPer1 and mPer2 genes in the cerebellum, we examined the effects of benzodiazepines on the expression of the mPer1 and mPer2 genes. 2. mPer2 mRNA expression was higher at ZT16 than ZT4 in the mouse cerebellum. 3. High-dose administration of diazepam (10 mg kg-1) or triazolam (1 mg kg-1) reduced mPer1 mRNA level 1 h after treatment in the cerebellum. 4. Reduced expression of mPer1 by diazepam treatment was transient. No difference of mPer1 mRNA level between diazepam (10 mg kg-1)- and vehicle-treated group was observed 6 h after treatment. 5. Administration of high doses of tandospirone (30 mg kg-1), a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic also reduced mPer1 mRNA expression 1 h after treatment. 6. Administration of high doses of clozapine (5 mg kg-1) or haloperidol (1 mg kg-1) impaired the rota-rod performance without affecting on mPer1 mRNA level. 7. Diazepam and tandospirone inhibited the expression of mPer1 mRNA in the primary cultured cerebellum granule cells. 8. Transient reductions of mPer1 mRNA levels by various benzodiazepines and tandospirone is associated with impairment of coordinated movement, such as rota-rod performance and equilibrium.", 
    "70": "Previous studies have described maturational changes in GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rodent somatosensory cortex during the early postnatal period. To determine whether alterations in the functional properties of synaptically localized GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) contribute to development of inhibitory transmission, we used the whole cell recording technique to examine GABAergic miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) in developing cortical neurons. Neurons harvested from somatosensory cortices of newborn mice showed a progressive, eightfold increase in GABAergic mPSC frequency during the first 4 wk of development in dissociated cell culture. A twofold decrease in the decay time of the GABAergic mPSCs, between 1 and 4 wk, demonstrates a functional change in the properties of GABA(A)Rs mediating synaptic transmission in cortical neurons during development in culture. A similar maturational profile observed in GABAergic mPSC frequency and decay time in cortical neurons developing in vivo (assessed in slices), suggests that these changes in synaptically localized GABA(A)Rs contribute to development of inhibition in the rodent neocortex. Pharmacological and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies were conducted to determine whether changes in subunit expression might contribute to the observed developmental alterations in synaptic GABA(A)Rs. Zolpidem (300 nM), a subunit-selective benzodiazepine agonist with high affinity for alpha1-subunits, caused a reversible slowing of the mPSC decay kinetics in cultured cortical neurons. Development was characterized by an increase in the potency of zolpidem in modulating the mPSC decay, suggesting a maturational increase in percentage of functionally active GABA(A)Rs containing alpha1 subunits. The relative expression of alpha1 versus alpha5 GABA(A)R subunit mRNA in cortical tissue, both in vivo and in vitro, also increased during this same period. Furthermore, single-cell RT-multiplex PCR analysis revealed more rapidly decaying mPSCs in individual neurons in which alpha1 versus alpha5 mRNA was amplified. Together these data suggest that changes in alpha-subunit composition of GABA(A)Rs contribute to the maturation of GABAergic mPSCs mediating inhibition in developing cortical neurons.",

    "72": "GABA(A) receptors of rat cerebellar granule cells in culture have been studied by the whole cell patch clamp technique. The biphasic desensitization kinetic observed could be due either to different desensitization mechanisms of a single receptor population or to different receptor populations. The overall data indicate that the latter hypothesis is most probably the correct one. In fact, the fast desensitizing component was selectively potentiated by a benzodiazepine agonist and preferentially down-regulated by activation of the protein serine/threonine kinases A and G, as a consequence of the latter characteristic that receptor population was preferentially down-regulated by previous activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptors, via production of nitric oxide and PKG activation, most probably in dendrites. The other population is benzodiazepine insensitive and not influenced by activation of PKA or PKG. This slowly desensitizing population may correspond to the extrasynaptic delta subunit containing GABA(A) receptors described by other authors. Instead, the rapidly desensitizing population appears to represent dendritic synaptic GABA(A) receptors.",

Using a MEDLINE and Cancerlit search, we found a total of 20 relevant publications. Recent research, mainly from the Netherlands, has shown that high doses of barbiturates are usually effective for physician-assisted suicide, while a combination of a barbiturate and a derivative of curare are effective for euthanasia. Opioids are less reliable drugs for physician-assisted death because of the unpredictable duration of the dying process even after high doses. The same applies to benzodiazepines. The most frequent undesired effect is an unexpectedly long dying process due to impaired uptake of the drugs. Although the evidence base is incomplete, the Dutch recommendations issued in 1994 and renewed in 1998 do not seem inappropriate.",

Deramciclane accumulated about three-fold during repeated administration. The relative bioavailability of deramciclane increased about 1.4-fold compared to that of a single dose at each dose level. The mean elimination half-life of deramciclane for 10, 30 and 60 mg doses prolonged from 24.3, 20.9 and 22.9 h after a single dose to 30.5, 25.6 and 28.7 h at steady-state, respectively.

The effect was first examined the morning after a single evening dose of VRE (600 mg LI 156) vs. flunitrazepam (FNZ) (1 mg) and placebo (PL) (trial section A), and then after two weeks of evening administration of VRE (600 mg LI 156) vs. PL (trial section B). 99 volunteers were analysed in section A and 91 in section B. The primary criterion was the median of reaction time (MRT) measured with the Vienna Determination Test. Secondary criteria were cognitrones (alertness test), tracking test (two-handed co-ordination), sleep quality (VIS-A, Vis-M), further VDT parameters, and safety criteria. The single administration of LI 156 did not impair the reaction abilities, concentration and co-ordination. After 14 days of treatment, the equivalence of VRE and PL was proven by confirmative analysis concerning the improvement of MRT (p = 0.4481). Evaluation of the secondary criteria were consistent with the results of the primary criterion. It is concluded that neither single nor repeated evening administrations of 600 mg of VRE have a relevant negative impact on reaction time, alertness and concentration the morning after intake.", 
    "83": "To determine whether there are menstrual cycle-related effects on cortical excitability in normal women.", 
    "84": "Ovarian steroid hormones affect neurotransmission in the brain. Data from animal experiments have shown that progesterone metabolites enhance the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex, producing benzodiazepine-like (e.g., diazepam and lorazepam) physiologic and behavioral effects. Estradiol has excitatory effects on measures of neuronal excitability, possibly acting through the glutamate system. These effects have been difficult to detect in women using conventional techniques. However, recently, paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to detect the effects of GABAergic and glutamatergic drugs in humans. We used this method to measure the effects of the menstrual cycle in normal women.", 
    "85": "We tested 13 healthy women during the follicular (low-progesterone) and luteal (high-progesterone) phases of the menstrual cycle using paired TMS. The effect of a subthreshold conditioning pulse on the cortex was tested by measuring the response to a second suprathreshold test pulse and comparing it with the response elicited by the test pulse administered alone.", 
    "86": "Conditioning TMS produced more inhibition in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (p = 0.01), of similar magnitude to the reported effect of benzodiazepine drugs.",

    "89": "Structural and glucose metabolic abnormalities of the thalamus are considered important in the pathophysiology of TLE. The differential involvement of various thalamic nuclei in humans is not known.", 
    "90": "Twelve patients with TLE underwent volumetric MRI, FDG and FMZ PET, and prolonged video-EEG monitoring. Normalized values and asymmetries of glucose metabolism and FMZ binding were obtained in three thalamic regions (dorsomedial nucleus [DMN], pulvinar, and lateral thalamus [LAT]) defined on MRI and copied to coregistered, partial-volume-corrected FDG and FMZ PET images. Hippocampal and amygdaloid FMZ binding asymmetries and thalamic volumes also were measured.", 
    "91": "The DMN showed significantly lower glucose metabolism and FMZ binding on the side of the epileptic focus. The LAT showed bilateral hypermetabolism and increased FMZ binding. There was a significant correlation between the FMZ binding asymmetries of the DMN and amygdala. The PET abnormalities were associated with a significant volume loss of the thalamus ipsilateral to the seizure focus.", 
    "92": "Decreased [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) binding and glucose metabolism of the dorsomedial nucleus (DMN) are common and have strong lateralization value for the seizure focus in human temporal lobe epilepsy. Decreased benzodiazepine receptor binding can be due to neuronal loss, as suggested by volume loss, but also may indicate impaired gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission in the DMN, which has strong reciprocal connections with other parts of the limbic system. Increased glucose metabolism and FMZ binding in the lateral thalamus could represent an upregulation of GABA-mediated inhibitory circuits.",

Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were suppressed in all age groups, the three youngest groups being more sensitive than older animals. The highest dose of Ro 19-8022 did not exhibit anticonvulsant action in the 25-day-old rats. The other types of seizures (minimal clonic) induced by PTZ were suppressed by Ro 19-8022 only in 18-day-old and older rats in which PTZ reliably elicited these types of seizures. The doses of 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg were ineffective against minimal seizures. On the contrary, incidence of minimal seizures was significantly increased by Ro 19-8022 in 7-and 12-day-old rat pups. Motor performance of rat pups was not compromised by Ro 19-8022 (0.5 and 50 mg/kg) in contrast to the full agonist midazolam (1 and/or 2 mg/kg). The duration of anticonvulsant effects studied with a dose of 0.5 mg/kg was longer in 12-day-old than in adult rats. This dose of Ro 19-8022 resulted in a rebound proconvulsant effect 24 and 48 h after the administration in 12-day-old rats only. Ro 19-8022 exhibited an excellent anticonvulsant action especially against generalized tonic-clonic seizures; this action was lost with very high doses. It did not compromise the motor system, but in some tests motivation was probably lost.", 
    "94": "Since the discovery of the neuroleptics in 1952, french psychiatrists have proposed a classification of neuroleptics taking into account the pharmalogical and therapeutic differences between these drugs. They distinguished three different clinical effects of neuroleptics: sedative effects, effects on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and effects on the negative symptoms. However these agents have many side effects including the extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS), akathisia, dystonia and parkinsonism. These side effects occur in up to 75% of patients receiving typical neuroleptics and are the main cause of non-compliance. Since the eighties, clozapine was introduced for use in refractory patients because it has a better efficacy (than haloperidol) specifically on negative symptoms, a better tolerance and fewer effects. After clozapine, several new antipsychotic agents are now available, such as risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole, quietapine, ziprasidone ... Their therapeutical effects are probably linked with a dual antagonist effect on 5HT2 and D2 receptors. The present article reviews the evolution of the use of these new agents, their real efficacy, their adverse effects and their expanding indications. Future research will more clearly establish appropriate treatment guidelines for their use. These new antipsychotics should add a positive modification in schizophrenia care and in some mood disorders. The approach consisting on individualizing dimensions and clusters analysis might be useful to test the efficiency of each antipsychotic on a syndromic dimension.",

Venous blood samples (4 ml each) were obtained before induction as a control and at 0.5, 1, 3, 5 minutes after the administration of each induction agent, and then furthermore at 0.5, 1, 3, 5 minutes after tracheal intubation in order to measure the plasma histamine level by using the HPLC post-label system. In addition, the blood pressure and heart rate were also simultaneously recorded. Skin reactions were also evaluated by two anesthesiologists.", 
    "98": "The incidence of 50% histamine release during the induction of anesthesia with propofol occurred in 15% of the patients with a history of allergy. Sixteen patients out of 20 (80%) showed a decrease in the systolic blood pressure after the administration of propofol without any evidence of histamine release. The incidence of 50% histamine release, skin reactions and an increase in the heart rate between the two groups were not statistically significant after the administration of each anesthetic agent. Moreover, some patients also demonstrated histamine release after tracheal intubation. Hemodynamic changes after tracheal intubation showed a similar tendency in both groups. No significant difference was observed regarding the incidence of histamine release, skin reactions and hemodynamic changes between both groups after tracheal intubation.", 
    "99": "Propofol was found to show a similar incidence of histamine release during the induction of anesthesia using midazolam-ketamine, and thus was also found to be a useful induction agent against histamine release for patients with a history of allergy when hydroxizine was used as a premedication.", 
    "100": "Fat emulsions can cause changes in blood-clotting and fibrinolysis. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between the use of the short-acting hypnotic propofol and alteration of the blood clotting system. In a double-blind randomized study, 36 patients with an aortocoronary bypass operation were given either midazolam/fentanyl or propofol/alfentanil. Eleven blood samples were taken at fixed times pre-, intra- and postoperatively to determine changes caused by the anesthetic agents on the hemostaseologic parameters during the whole operation. Perioperative blood pressures of both groups were measured at seven fixed points. From the beginning of the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) to the end of the operation, the measured values of the factor XIIa- and kallikrein-like activity in the propofol group were significantly higher than those of the midazolam group. Also the values of the kallikrein inhibition capacity and the indicators of fibrinolysis (t-PA and D-dimers) suggest a stronger activation of the contact phase at the start of the recirculation and as a result of it a stronger fibrinolysis within the propofol group. Besides, the hypotensive side-effect in the propofol group was evident in contrast to the midazolam group. With this investigation, a correlation between the application of propofol/alfentanil, contact phase activation with activation of the kallikrein-kinin-bradykinin system and the observed hypotension can be set up.", 
    "101": "Depressed patients often report problems sleeping, and epidemiologic evidence suggests that insomnia may precede the onset of depression. Insomnia is associated with marked impairment in quality of life and ability to function effectively. Many studies have indicated that patients with chronic sleep problems have impaired mood and that effective management of insomnia in depressed patients can markedly improve their depression. Diagnosis of insomnia is challenging because there can be many different causes and the clinical picture can be blurred by the presence of other psychiatric illnesses. Pharmacotherapy provides reliable and rapid relief from insomnia, whereas behavioral therapies help produce long-term improvement. For many years, benzodiazepines have been the mainstay of drug treatment for insomnia. However, these drugs have significant side effects, and tolerance and dependence have discouraged use. Many doctors use sedating antidepressants in low doses to treat chronic insomnia. However, there is little evidence supporting the efficacy of these agents, and many have adverse side effects, including impairment of sleep. The newer selective hypnotic drugs, including the imidazopyridines, may offer patients a better short-term alternative to benzodiazepines or sedating antidepressants.", 
    "102": "Vast arrays of medications have been used, with limited success, to manage stuttering. Haloperidol and risperidone are the only two medications that have shown efficacy via double-blind studies in controlling stuttering symptoms. We present the first case reports of olanzapine in the management of stuttering. Three case histories are presented: a 10-year-old boy, a 16-year-old male adolescent with developmental stuttering, and a 9-year-old boy with medication-induced stuttering whose symptoms are successfully controlled with olanzapine. These case studies suggest that olanzapine may be a pharmacologic option in the management of stuttering.", 
    "103": "Diagnostic and therapeutic fiberoscopy of gastrointestinal tract is often performed ambulatory and sedation is sometimes also required. Indication for sedation can be the intervention itself or the patient's psychological state. Aim of the study was to compare the effects of midazolam and combination of midazolam and fentanyl during endoscopy. Twenty eight cases were investigated: oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (n = 14) and colonoscopy (n = 14). Anaesthetics were midazolam (M) in 16 cases, midazolam-fentanyl (MF) in 12 cases. Non-invasive mean arterial pressure, pulse rate, acid-base balance and blood gases (by Astrup method) were recorded before endoscopy, at the 5th and 10th minutes of endoscopy, 15 minutes after intervention and also before emission. Pulse rate changed between 78-92/min. Mean arterial pressure appeared between 84-90 mm Hg. In MF group both were lower but there was not significant difference between the groups. The values were in normal range, there were not metabolic acidosis which needed correction. Onset of sedative effect was 2.8 min. in M group, 2.3 min. in MF group. The ability for adequate reaction returned within 11 min. in M group, within 14 min. in MF group. Fentanyl prolongs sedative effect of midazolam and offers sufficient pain relief. After 3 hours, patients could be emitted from the hospital.", 
    "104": "The effect of acetylcholine on the isolated, non-precontracted, porcine internal mammary artery (IMA) was investigated. Acetylcholine induced concentration-dependent contractions of non-precontracted IMA rings with denuded endothelium (pEC50 = 5.80 +/- 0.04) and was without effect on arterial segments with intact endothelium. The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, pirenzepine, methoctramine and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-diphenidol (pFHHSiD) antagonized the response to acetylcholine. The constrained pA2 values were 10.14, 7.74, 7.34 and 10.5, respectively. It is concluded that acetylcholine induces concentration-dependent contractions of porcine internal mammary artery rings on basal tone and that this contractile effect is probably due to direct cholinergic stimulation of smooth muscle cells, maybe including activation of muscarinic M1 receptors.", 
    "105": "In the postoperative period after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the physician's enhanced attention should be focused on the incidence of myocardial ischaemia. The increased stress in the awakening patient as well as the return of autonomous reflexes can be the cause of imbalances in myocardial oxygen supply and uptake. Therefore, a probable influence of the pharmacologic profile of the intraoperatively applied anaesthetics on the incidence of postoperative myocardial ischaemia is of importance for adapting therapy on ICU to minimize any ischaemic risk. After approval by the ethics committee, a prospective randomized study was performed in 40 male patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The aim of the study was to compare balanced anaesthetic techniques performed with fentanyl and halothane, isoflurane and enflurane, respectively, with total intravenous anaesthesia performed with fentanyl and midazolam. An index to classify detection of ischaemia into three categories (ischaemia, probable ischaemia, no ischaemia) was established, based on measurements of myocardial lactate extraction and ST-segment analysis. Simultaneously, measurements of haemodynamic parameters and serum concentrations of catecholamines and intraoperatively applied anaesthetics were taken. In 8% of all measurements (30% of all patients) ischaemia was detected in the observation period and in 37% of all measurements (72.5% of all patients) probable ischaemia was detected. No significant difference was found concerning the incidence of myocardial ischaemia between all groups. The results of this investigation indicate that the application of inhalational anaesthetics for maintaining anaesthesia in coronary artery bypass graft surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "106": "Duocarmycins have been reported to derive their potent antitumor activity through a sequence-selective minor groove alkylation of N3 adenine in double-stranded DNA. We have used gel mobility shift assays to detect proteins that bind to DNA treated in vitro with duocarmycin SA and identified a protein, named duocarmycin-DNA adduct recognizing protein (DARP), which binds with increased affinity to duocarmycin-damaged DNA. Examination with partially purified DARP revealed that the protein recognized not only the DNA adduct of structurally related drug, CC-1065, but unexpectedly, the protein also recognized the DNA adduct of another chemotype of minor groove binder, anthramycin. These results demonstrate that DARP recognizes the structural alteration of DNA induced by these potent DNA-alkylating drugs, suggesting the possibility that the protein might modulate the antitumor activity of these drugs.", 
    "107": "The aim of this study was to prepare, using taste-masked granules, tablets which can rapidly disintegrate in saliva (rapidly disintegrating tablet), of drugs with bitter taste (pirenzepine HCl or oxybutynin HCl). The taste-masked granules were prepared using aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymers (Eudragit E-100) by the extrusion method. None of the drugs dissolved from the granules (% of dissolved, < 5%) even at 480 min at pH 6.8 in the dissolution test. However, the drugs dissolved rapidly in the medium at pH 1.2 in the dissolution test. Rapidly disintegrating tablets were prepared using the prepared taste-masked granules, and a mixture of excipients consisting of crystalline cellulose (Avicel PH-102) and low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC, LH-11). The granules and excipients were mixed well (mixing ratio by weight, crystalline cellulose: L-HPC = 8:2) with 1% magnesium stearate, and subsequently compressed at 500-1500 kgf in a single-punch tableting machine. The prepared tablets (compressed at 500 kgf) containing the taste-masked granules have sufficient strength (the crushing strength: oxybutynin tablet, 3.5 kg; pirenzepine tablet, 2.2 kg), and a rapid disintegration time (within 20 s) was observed in the saliva of healthy volunteers. None of the volunteers felt any bitter taste after the disintegration of the tablet which contained the taste-masked granules. We confirmed that the rapidly disintegrating tablets can be prepared using these taste-masked granules and excipients which are commonly used in tablet preparation.", 
    "108": "Acute repetitive seizures, also known as cluster or serial seizures, may present considerable health risks, including death, to patients with epilepsy and often are a cause of psychosocial stigma. Fortunately, new formulations and drug-delivery systems approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the past 5 years offer patients and health care providers greater control over acute repetitive seizures and emergency situations. Drugs that can be given intravenously, such as diazepam, phenytoin and valproate sodium solution, typically have the most rapid onset but are limited to use in clinical settings by health care professionals authorized to use them. In contrast, diazepam rectal gel can be administered to patients by their caregivers or family members in the home or in other non-hospital settings. Studies have shown that rectal diazepam used in such settings can reduce the number of emergency room visits, costs associated with emergent care and stress on the patient and family. Health education is necessary to help patients and families understand new treatment options and use them successfully. Additionally, facilitating patient compliance with prescribed treatment regimens may reduce the frequency and consequences of seizure emergencies.", 
    "109": "Postoperative epileptic seizures are recognised but rare. Psychogenic seizures and pseudostatus epilepticus are relatively common, particularly in the peri-operative period. Our series of five cases of postoperative pseudostatus epilepticus demonstrates that the failure to recognise the psychogenic nature of this condition may cause anaesthetists to give inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment. Psychogenic 'status' is easy to diagnose once it has been considered. Convulsive episodes lasting longer than 90 s, closed eyes during a 'tonic-clonic' attack, retained pupillary response and resistance to eye opening are useful signs. Often there is a history of multiple admissions with 'status epilepticus' and of previous postoperative 'status'.", 
    "110": "A postal and telephone survey of the practice of fasting before regional ophthalmic anaesthesia with and without sedation was sent to 50 hospitals in three regions of the United Kingdom. Responses were received from 100% of hospitals. In most hospitals (58%), local anaesthetic blocks were performed by both surgeons and anaesthetists, with surgeons alone providing ophthalmic anaesthesia in only 14%. Eighty-six per cent of hospitals surveyed had a formal policy regarding pre-operative fasting, with 44% allowing patients to eat and drink freely until their operation. In those hospitals where a fast was imposed, the most common fasting periods were 6 h for food and 2 h for fluids. Twenty-six per cent of respondents would be prepared to give intravenous sedation to a non-fasted patient during eye surgery: small doses of benzodiazepine were the most frequently suggested method. National evidence-based guidelines for ophthalmic regional anaesthesia are needed.", 
    "111": "Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective and potent alpha2-adrenergic agonist, has a potentially useful role as a sedative agent in patients requiring intensive care. As part of a larger European multicentre trial, a total of 119 postoperative cardiac and general surgical patients requiring ventilation and sedation in an intensive care unit were enrolled in four centres in the United Kingdom. One hundred and five patients were randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine or placebo with rescue sedation and analgesia provided by midazolam and morphine, respectively. Compared with the control group, intubated patients receiving dexmedetomidine required 80% less midazolam [mean 4.9 (5.8) microg.kg-1.h-1 vs. 23.7 (27.5) microg.kg-1.h-1, p < 0.0001], and 50% less morphine [11.2 (13.4) microg.kg-1.h-1 vs. 21.5 (19.4) microg.kg-1.h-1,p = 0.0006]. Cardiovascular effects and adverse events could be predicted from the known properties of alpha-2 agonists. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine is a useful agent for the provision of postoperative analgesia and sedation.", 
    "112": "The main purpose of this study was to investigate the chemical stability of a new antidote combination for the treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The antidote combination was packed (enclosed) in two plastic compartments separated by a barrier film. One of them contained a powder oxime cholinesterase reactivator (HI-6-monohydrate 1-[[[4-(aminocarbonyl)pyridinio]methoxy]methyl]-2-[(hydro xyimino)meth yl]-pyridinium dichloride). The other contained an anticholinergic (Atropine) and an anticonvulsant (Prodiazepam or Avizafone (L-lysyl-N-(2-benzoyl-4-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-glycinamide dihydrochloride) drug in a liquid mixture. The plastic compartments were mounted in an autoinjector device to study the dissolution of HI-6 by ejection of the solution. Drug analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained after 6 months show that this new antidote combination is stable. The amount of each antidote is unchanged during the study. Some known degradation products can be detected in small amounts. The autoinjector mechanism used, gives a complete dissolution of HI-6 powder in the liquid mixture throughout the study.",

The on-line procedure uses an immobilized, highly reusable antibody against benzodiazepines for selective extraction from serum followed by analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. This reliable method provides a limit of detection of 1 ng/mL serum, and results are obtained in less than 40 min.", 
    "114": "Use of sedative and analgesic pharmacological agents is a widespread practice in intensive care units (ICUs). Mainly, this involves opioid and benzodiazepine analogues, both known to induce dependence/tolerance states. This paper is based on a clinical scenario in which a patient treated with these agents developed problems when they had been discontinued, and exploration of the extent of such problems generally. The problems range across a wide range of domains and may include physical discomfort, difficulty weaning from respiratory assistance and the drugs, and the problems of short- and long-term psychological distress. Although there may be a recognition that these drugs can typically cause dependence problems, little emphasis has traditionally been given to assessing these problems in ICUs. Yet the ICU may be an area where these drugs are used in high volumes. The recognition, physiology, management and prevention of iatrogenic drug dependence/tolerance in critical care environments is elucidated, with reference to relevant literature.", 
    "115": "A muscarinic alkaloid with a quaternary nitrogen was isolated from Trophis racemosa. Aqueous solutions (0.5%-2%) of the chloride salt of the alkaloid produced dose-dependent reductions of intra-ocular pressure ranging from 6.6 +/- 0.7 mmHg to 15.7 +/- 0.3 mmHg, (p < 0. 001, n = 5) in dogs. Atropine (0.1 mL of a 1% solution) and pirenzepine at a non selective antagonist dose (0.1 mL of 0.5% solution) for M(1) and M(3) receptors blocked the reduction of intra-ocular pressure, but alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mL of a 1% solution) did not block the reduction of intra-ocular pressure. On the isolated guinea-pig ileum and trachea, the alkaloid produced contractions which were inhibited by atropine (6 x 10(-7) M or 0.4 microg/mL) and by pirenzepine at a non-selective antagonist dose (3.1 x 10(-6) M or 1.3 microg/mL) for M(1) and M(3) receptors. But neither selective blockade of M(2) receptors with gallamine (1.7 x 10(-6) M or 1.5 microg/mL) nor selective blockade of M(1) receptors with pirenzepine (7 x 10(-9) M or 3 ng/mL) inhibited the alkaloid-induced contractions. There was also no inhibition of the alkaloid-induced contractions in the presence of ganglionic nicotinic receptor blockade with pentolinium (5.6 x 10(-7) M or 0.3 microg/mL) and hexamethonium (1.7 x 10(-6) M or 0.6 microg/mL), but nicotine-induced contractions were inhibited by these ganglionic blockers. These results suggest that a muscarinic alkaloid from Trophis racemosa produced ocular hypotension via M(3) receptor stimulation in dogs.", 
    "116": "Concentrations of neurosteroids have been measured in the brains of postnatal myelin mutants jimpy (jp) and shiverer (shi) mice and of their normal controls. Progesterone (PROG) concentrations were increased more than threefold in the brains of mutant mice. Marked astroglial reaction occurs in the brains of jp mice and to a much smaller extent in shi ones. Whereas the mitochondrial benzodiazepine/diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptor (MBR) was below the immunohistochemical detection limit in normal mice (except in the choroid plexus and ependyma cells), it was significantly expressed in many reactive astrocytes of jp and shi mice brains. DBI-like peptides, investigated either by immunohistochemistry or by radioimmunoassay, were expressed to similar extents in mutant and control mice. Reversed-phase HPLC indicated that DBI-like peptides were almost exclusively of the triakontatetraneuropeptide size. It was concluded that the increased expression of MBR (involved in the intramitochondrial delivery of cholesterol to P450scc) likely accounts for the large PROG content in mutant mice brain. The role of PROG in myelin repair is discussed.", 
    "117": "In amacrine-like cells freshly dissociated from crucian carp (Carassius auratus) retina, we recorded whole-cell responses to rapid application of glutamate and kainate. Currents induced by glutamate, but not kainate, usually showed extremely rapid desensitization, and the mean time constant for the decay of the responses to 10 mM glutamate was 2.77 ms. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) failed to induce any current even with coapplication of glycine and removal of extracellular Mg2 +. 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-Methylcarbamyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3, 4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53655), a selective alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, was found to completely block glutamate-induced currents, suggesting that the glutamate receptors on these cells are AMPA preferring. The value of EC50 for glutamate and kainate was determined to be 2.73 mM and 97.5 microM, respectively. Noise analysis of fluctuation of whole-cell currents induced by kainate of different concentrations indicated that the mean conductance of the AMPA receptor channels was 5.70 pS. Splice variant analysis of the AMPA receptors was also conducted by comparing the effects of cyclothiazide, a flip receptor-preferring modulator and 4-[2-(phenylsulphonylamino)ethylthio]-2,6-difluoro-phenoxyaceta mide (PEPA), a flop receptor-preferring modulator, on glutamate-induced responses. PEPA was much more potent than cyclothiazide at these receptors with a EC50 of 17.3 microM. The mean ratio of the potentiation by PEPA versus cyclothiazide (P/C ratio) was 4.39. These modulatory effects of cyclothiazide and PEPA were rather similar to those obtained at AMPA receptors assembled from flop variants expressed in Xenopus oocytes, suggesting that the AMPA receptor of the carp amacrine cells may predominantly consist of the flop splice variants.",

Oxidative stress induced a significant increase in extracellular potassium, which was not modified by incubation with flumazenil. Bupivacaine significantly lowered the increase in extracellular potassium in a dose-related fashion. The association with flumazenil blunted the effects of bupivacaine. Discussion In this model, bupivacaine proved effective in protecting erythrocytes against oxidative stress. Flumazenil interacted with bupivacaine and blunted its protective effects.",

    "130": "In Sweden, all pharmacies are owned by one corporation, Apoteket AB. This corporation collects, stores and compiles statistics on all drug sales in Sweden, and data are available both on national, regional, county and municipal levels. The employed unit is defined daily dose (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Using the pharmacy computer system while dispensing a drug, prescription patterns can be elucidated. This system describes the number of drug items dispensed, drug amounts and age and gender of patients. Furthermore, data from another, ecological study were used to relate codeine and propoxyphene utilisation to that of benzodiazepines and to various socioeconomic data available from records of the city of Malm\u00f6.", 
    "131": "The utilisation of analgesics in Sweden has increased during a 10-year period. The withdrawal of over-the-counter combinations containing aspirin and low-dose codeine in 1990 resulted only in a transient decrease of codeine use. The utilisation of codeine in Malm\u00f6 and G\u00f6teborg was considerably higher than that in Stockholm and in the rest of Sweden, including the surroundings of Malm\u00f6. In Malm\u00f6 and G\u00f6teborg, codeine was most often prescribed by private physicians to middle-aged persons, particularly women. Districts in Malm\u00f6 with a high utilisation of codeine were associated with unfavourable socioeconomic conditions and a high utilisation of benzodiazepines. The utilisation pattern of propoxyphene showed less or no such deviations.", 
    "132": "The results suggest an inappropriate use of codeine in two major cities in Sweden.", 
    "133": "N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism and GABA(A) receptor activation are believed to be critical targets for general anesthetic action. However, as NMDA antagonism of intravenous anesthetic agents causes post-anesthetic emergence reactions such as hallucination and agitation, while the GABA(A)-mimetic intravenous anesthetic agents do not, these two classes of intravenous anesthetic agents produce differential clinical profiles.", 
    "134": "We have investigated the differential effects of the GABA(A) agonists propofol and midazolam and the NMDA antagonist ketamine on noradrenaline release from the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat using microdialysis, as noradrenergic neurons have a role to play in anesthesia and are known to be important in the control of sleep, attention and learning.", 
    "135": "Twenty-one male Wistar rats (200-270 g) were randomly allocated into three groups: ketamine 100 mg x kg(-1) (n = 6), propofol 60 mg x kg(-1) (n = 8) and midazolam 5 mg x kg(-1) (n = 7) IP. A unilateral guide cannula was implanted stereotaxically into the medial prefrontal cortex under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg x kg(-1) IP). Forty-eight hours later, a dialysis probe was inserted through the guide cannula, and perfused with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution containing 1 mM pargyline. Following an equilibration period, samples of dialysate were collected every 10 min. Noradrenaline content was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using an electrochemical detector.", 
    "136": "Anesthesia times, defined as the duration between the loss of righting reflex and recovery, were 24.7+/-5.6 (SEM), 20.5+/-1.9 and 25.2+/-1.5 min for propofol, midazolam and ketamine, respectively (no significant between-group differences). Both GABA(A )agonists, propofol and midazolam, significantly decreased noradrenaline release (75% and 71% of basal release, respectively). The NMDA antagonist ketamine markedly increased noradrenaline release (413% of basal).", 
    "137": "These data suggest that different clinical profiles observed with these two classes of sedatives may result from changes in noradrenaline release from the medial prefrontal cortex.", 
    "138": "Threatening social stimuli were used in this study as aversive conditions to test anxiety in lactating female mice. The odors of potential infanticidal males or the \"stress odor\" left by restrained mice represented two aversive conditions that have been suggested to modulate the time spent by the mothers to reach their pups after 30 min of separation.",

    "140": "Lactating mice of the NMRI outbred strain with 8-day old pups were treated with (1) chlordiazepoxide (CDP) 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg i.p.; (2) flumazenil 10 mg/kg i.p. and (3) methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) 3.0 mg/kg i.p.", 
    "141": "The odors left by stressed females changed the mothers' exploratory behavior, but not the latency to reach pups. The latency was higher in the presence of cues from potentially infanticidal males. CDP (5.0 mg/kg) reduced the time spent to contact pups, whereas the other CDP doses did not modify the dam's behavior. Flumazenil, given in combination with CDP (5.0 mg/kg) antagonized the latter anxiolytic effect. In addition, in the presence of cues from potentially infanticidal males beta-CCM had anxiogenic activity, increasing latency to reach pups. The same CDP and beta-CCM doses were ineffective in the presence of cues from stressed females and in the absence of olfactory cues from conspecifics.",

    "144": "The goal of the current study was to examine the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil in untreated and diazepam-treated monkeys to determine whether this type of procedure could be used to examine benzodiazepine dependence.", 
    "145": "Flumazenil (0.32 mg/kg s.c.) was established as a discriminative stimulus in eight monkeys receiving 5.6 mg/kg/day of diazepam (p.o.); four responded under a fixed ratio (FR)5 schedule of stimulus-shock termination (SST) and four responded under a FR5 schedule of food presentation. For comparison, 1.0 mg/kg flumazenil (s.c.) was established as a discriminative stimulus in four untreated monkeys responding under a FR5 schedule of SST.", 
    "146": "Flumazenil dose-dependently increased responding on the flumazenil-appropriate lever in all monkeys. In diazepam-treated monkeys, Ro 15-4513, ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and bretazenil substituted for flumazenil with pentylenetetrazole substituting in some monkeys; other drugs failed to substitute for flumazenil. Acute administration of 10.0 mg/kg diazepam (s.c.) shifted the flumazenil dose-effect curve threefold to the right of the control dose-effect curve. Temporary suspension of diazepam treatment produced a time-related increase in flumazenil-lever responding that was reversed by diazepam. In untreated monkeys, midazolam substituted for flumazenil, with other drugs, including those with primary mechanisms of action at non-gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors, substituting in some monkeys. Ro 15-4513 did not substitute in any untreated monkey.", 
    "147": "The flumazenil discriminative stimulus appears to be pharmacologically selective in treated monkeys with only negative and low efficacy positive modulators substituting for flumazenil; in contrast, a variety of drugs substitute for flumazenil in untreated monkeys. This apparent difference in selectivity suggests that diazepam treatment modifies the flumazenil discriminative stimulus perhaps due to the development of dependence.", 
    "148": "Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels are involved in intermale aggression in mice. It was therefore expected that animals genetically selected for their sensitivity to the convulsive effects of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM; BS, beta-CCM sensitive, and BR, beta-CCM resistant), a benzodiazepine (BZ) inverse agonist that specifically binds to the BZ site on the GABA-A receptor complex, would differ in their levels of aggressive behavior. Using two different aggression tests, in two independent experiments, we showed that BS mice are more aggressive than BR animals. The precise mechanisms underlying the observed line differences in beta-CCM sensitivity and aggression remain to be determined.", 
    "149": "The aim of our investigations was to supplement the scarce information about behavioral effects of olanzapine and especially to find out if the effects change during prolonged treatment. It was established that at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, which did not evoke sedation, olanzapine had distinct anxiolytic effects, both after acute and chronic treatment. Olanzapine improved memory in the maze test (food finding time), but only in chronic experiments after a lag of 14 days. Olanzapine at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg did not cause catalepsy but a higher dose of 1 mg/kg elicited strong sedating effects, which would interfere with the catalepsy test. The results of Porsolt's test (immobility time in swimming rats) were interesting because a shortening of immobility time occurred only after single drug injection. Our results are in agreement with the statement of other authors that olanzapine has greater potency in antagonizing responses mediated rather by 5-HT than D2 receptors.", 
    "150": "The aim of this study was to compare rectal sedation with diazepam and rectal sedation with midazolam with regard to sedative effect, treatment acceptance, and amnesia. Ninety children, 1.5-3.5 years of age, consecutively referred for extractions of traumatized primary incisors were randomly sedated with diazepam (0.7 mg/kg body weight) or midazolam (0.3 mg/kg body weight). The study design was randomized and double-blind. The level of sedation (state of mind) was assessed prior to and 10 and 60 min after administration of the drug by use of a behavioral scale (Wilton). The children's acceptance of procedures was assessed using another behavioral scale (Holst) during administration of the sedative, application of topical anesthesia, injection of a local anesthesia, and extraction. Amnesia was evaluated by the parents on the following day, with the child being asked standardized questions. Parental ratings of the child's and their own distress during and after treatment were made on a visual analog scale (VAS). No differences were found between the sedatives concerning level of sedation during treatment, acceptance of procedures, or amnesia. At discharge, 60 min after administration of the sedative, the children receiving diazepam were significantly more agitated (P=0.006). Parental rating on a VAS of the child's discomfort after treatment was significantly higher in the diazepam group (P=0.006). There was a tendency for children with poor acceptance of the rectal administration to display a more negative acceptance of the dental treatment. In conclusion, the present results, in combination with known pharmacological advantages, indicate that midazolam is preferable in outpatients when sedation is needed and amnesia is desirable.", 
    "151": "Three-channel actometry was used to study neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA), a common and often serious disorder in association of traditional neuroleptic therapy. The aim was to explore the diagnostic possibilities of actometry in NIA and to examine in detail the motor phenomenology of the disorder in detail. The actometers were attached to the ankles and waists of ten patients, suffering from NIA, and to ten matched healthy controls. Five of the patients were changed to olanzapine treatment, and these patients were re-examined during the no-NIA condition. NIA was associated with manyfold movement activity during controlled rest (sitting) but not with increased daily overall motor activity. Movement frequencies in NIA seemed to be pathognomonic. Actometry is promising for investigation and clinical assessment of NIA. Olanzapine proved to be an adequate treatment choice for NIA patients.", 
    "152": "This study examined plasma concentrations of olanzapine by sex (20 males and seven females) in an 8-week fixed-dose study. Dosing was 12.5 mg/day for the first week, then 25 mg/day. Trough plasma concentrations were drawn at weeks 1, 3, 5 and 8. Women volunteers were found to have significantly higher plasma concentrations than men. This difference was first evident at study week 5. Women have higher plasma concentrations of olanzapine, possibly due to differences in metabolism of the CYP450 isoenzyme system.", 
    "153": "Female rats were exposed to diazepam (DZ) implants (90 mg/week) or to empty capsules (controls) for 5 weeks. Rats were focally injected (1 microl) into the substantia nigra (SNR) with the central (CBR) and peripheral (PBR) benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, flumazenil [(FLU) 6.25, 12.5, or 25 microg], and PK 11195 [(PK) 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 microg], respectively. Rats were observed for behavioral and EEG manifestation of withdrawal syndrome. In female rats, both FLU and PK induced a dose-related precipitated abstinence score (PAS), tachypnea, and head bobbing. Twitches and jerks tended to increase with increasing dose of both FLU and PK. Furthermore, FLU evoked dose-related turning and head and body tremors. The FLU- and the PK-induced PAS were accompanied by an increase in total power of the EEG in the SNR. The involvement of the CBR and PBR in physical dependence on DZ in the SNR is suggested. The present data in female rats are discussed with regard to similarities and differences with previous studies in male rats.", 
    "154": "It is well known that the GABAergic and noradrenergic systems play an important role in blood pressure and heart rate regulation. Benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines, respectively, increase or decrease the probability of chloride-channel opening induced by GABA. The aim of this study was to determine, in conscious rats, the interaction existing between the central alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulation induced by clonidine and the facilitation or impairment of benzodiazepine receptor activity through the administration of either diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, or methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), an inverse benzodiazepine agonist. Clonidine (5-10 microg, intracerebroventricularly) reduced heart rate and increased mean blood pressure by activation of central alpha2-adrenoceptors. Diazepam (2 mg/kg, intravenously (i.v.)) induced an increase in heart rate, while DMCM (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) elicited a bradycardic effect. The bradycardic effects induced by both clonidine and DMCM were antagonized by the prior administration of methylatropine (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.). DMCM (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) prevented the clonidine effects on heart rate and mean blood pressure, while diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.v.) failed to modify these effects. Our results suggest that the bradycardic effects of clonidine are mediated by a vagal stimulation and are related to the activation of a GABAergic pathway.", 
    "155": "Social phobia is a highly prevalent yet often overlooked psychiatric disorder that can cause severe disability but fortunately has shown responsiveness to specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Recognition of its essential clinical features and the use of brief, targeted screening questions can improve detection within family practice settings. Cognitive behavioral therapy, with or without specific antidepressant therapy, is the evidence-based treatment of choice for most patients. Adjunctive use of benzodiazepines can facilitate the treatment response of patients who need initial symptom relief. The use of beta blockers as needed has been found to be helpful in the treatment of circumscribed social and performance phobias. Treatment planning should consider the patient's preference, the severity of presenting symptoms, the degree of functional impairment, psychiatric and substance-related comorbidity, and long-term treatment goals.", 
    "156": "The present study determined the impact of early handling (EH) in rats on behavioral response to environmental stress and on peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) binding characteristics (Bmax and Kd) in various organs. The behavioral consequences of EH in rats were expressed as increased exploratory activity in an open-field paradigm, when compared with nonhandled control rats. These findings are interpreted in terms of decreased emotionality. The biochemical consequences of EH, in both male and female rats, were expressed as the upregulation of PBR in the adrenal and kidney and the downregulation of gonadal (testis and ovary) PBR. It is possible that the long-lasting adrenal and renal changes in PBR expression in EH rats may enable better regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, renin-angiotensin system, and autonomic nervous system responses to stress in adulthood. The significance of the EH-induced reduction in gonadal PBR for gonadal activity in adulthood is as yet unclear.", 
    "157": "Prenatal exposure to diazepam, a benzodiazepine (BZD) compound, leads to pronounced effects on responses to stressors in exposed animals when they reach adulthood. Many of the responses are sex specific. The mechanisms mediating the effects of the exposure on the organism have not been elucidated; however, the time course for the appearance of altered function following in utero drug exposure indicates that the exposure interfered with neural organization of mechanisms mediating responses to stressors. The article discusses possible mechanisms that relate to sites of action of the drug in the developing brain: the GABA(A) receptor, and the mitochondrial BZD receptor. The mechanisms mediating the sex-specific impact of diazepam on the developing brain appear to be complex and interactive.", 
    "158": "Hyperemesis gravidarum is a relatively unknown disease, and is generally self-limiting. In some women the symptoms are so severe as to threaten the health of the mother and fetus. Therapies proposed for hyperemesis gravidarum are therefore rather empirical. Medical treatment includes parenteral fluid replacement and nutrition, electrolytes, antiemetics, vitamins, sedation and psychological counseling. Diazepam and benzodiazepines have been widely studied in pregnancy but the results are contradictory. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of parenteral fluids with vitamins, with or without diazepam sedation.", 
    "159": "Fifty women with hyperemesis gravidarum were enrolled in the study. They were treated with infusions of normal saline, glucose, vitamins and randomly with diazepam.", 
    "160": "The results show that the mean stay in the hospital was shorter in the diazepam group: 4.5 +/- 1.9 vs. 6 +/- 1.6 days (p < 0.05) and readmission to the hospital was 4% in the diazepam group versus 27% in other group (p < 0.05). There was a significant reduction in nausea in the diazepam group (p < 0.05). A significant reduction in vomiting was observed in both groups. No side effects or congenital neonatal malformations were found in the diazepam group.", 
    "161": "Intravenous administration of fluids and vitamins is the standard treatment for women hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum. The addition of diazepam to the treatment is effective in reducing nausea and does not have teratogenic effects.", 
    "162": "The 5-HT(1A/7) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) has chronobiological effects on the circadian system and, in the Syrian hamster, it is known that serotonergic (5-HT) projections connecting the median raphe nucleus to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus are a prerequisite for the expression of 8-OH-DPAT-induced phase advance of locomotor activity rhythm. We examined the possible involvement of the thalamic intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) in the phase-shifting properties of 8-OH-DPAT injections at CT7. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the IGL blocked phase-shift responses to 8-OH-DPAT of the activity rhythm. Phase changes induced by injections of 8-OH-DPAT at CT7 and triazolam (Tz), a short-acting benzodiazepine, at CT6 were also studied after bilateral chemical lesion of the 5-HT fibres connecting the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) to IGL. Destruction of 5-HT fibres within the IGL blocked the phase-shift response to Tz, but not the phase-shift response to 8-OH-DPAT. In conclusion, (a) IGL is essential for the phase-shifting effect of peripheral 8-OH-DPAT injections; (b) 5-HT fibres connecting DR to IGL are necessary for the expression of the phase-shifting effect of Tz but not of 8-OH-DPAT.", 
    "163": "Preclinical studies of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Romazicon) have contributed to the understanding of the physical dependence associated with chronic benzodiazepine use; when administered to animals chronically pretreated with benzodiazepines, flumazenil precipitates a withdrawal syndrome. However, few controlled clinical studies have been conducted.", 
    "164": "The objective was to characterize the effects of flumazenil in long-term users of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines.", 
    "165": "The acute physiological, participant-rated, and observer-rated effects of intravenously administered flumazenil (1 mg/70 kg) and caffeine (300 mg/70 kg; active drug control) were evaluated in an experimental group of 13 long-term users (mean 4.6 years) of low therapeutic doses (mean 11.2 mg/day diazepam equivalent) relative to a matched group of 13 volunteers without prior exposure to benzodiazepines in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, mixed design.", 
    "166": "Whereas the experimental group did not differ from the control group with respect to the effects of placebo, and both groups showed some changes in response to caffeine (e.g., increased blood pressure and anxiety scores), only the experimental group showed considerable changes in physiological measures, participant ratings (e.g., increased ratings of dizziness, blurred vision, heart pounding, feelings of unreality, pins and needles, nausea, sweatiness, noises louder than usual, jitteriness, things moving, sensitivity to touch), and observer ratings in response to flumazenil; in addition, four participants developed panic attacks.", 
    "167": "This study clearly demonstrates that flumazenil can precipitate symptoms commonly associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal in chronic low-dose benzodiazepine users."
