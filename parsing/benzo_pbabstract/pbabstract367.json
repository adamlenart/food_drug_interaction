The guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) are IFN-inducible GTP-binding proteins of approximately 65 kDa that possess a CaaX motif at their C-terminus, indicating that they might be substrates for prenyltransferases. The human GBP1 protein, when expressed in transfected COS-1 cells, incorporates radioactivity from the isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonate. In addition, huGBPs expressed from the endogenous genes in IFN-gamma-treated human fibroblasts or monocytic cells were also found to be isoprenoid modified. IFN-gamma-induced huGBPs in HL-60 cells were not labeled by the specific C20 isoprenoid, [3H]geranylgeraniol, but did show decreased isoprenoid incorporation in cells treated with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor BZA-5B, indicating that huGBPs in HL-60 cells are probably modified by a C15 farnesyl rather than the more common C20 lipid. Differentiated HL-60 cells treated with IFN-gamma/LPS showed no change in the profile of constitutive isoprenylated proteins and the IFN-gamma/LPS-induced huGBPs remained prenylated. Despite being prenylated, huGBP1 in COS cells and endogenous huGBPs in HL-60 cells were primarily (approximately 85%) cytosolic. Human GBPs are thus among the select group of prenyl proteins whose synthesis is tightly regulated by a cytokine. HuGBP1 is an abundant protein whose prenylation may be vulnerable to farnesyl transferase inhibitors that are designed to prevent farnesylation of Ras proteins.",

    "2": "Ethanol (EtOH) suppresses natural killer (NK) cell activity in the spleen in a binge drinking model in mice. Direct effects of EtOH and its metabolites are not the major cause of this suppression. In this study, the role of catecholamines, glucocorticoids and opioids in EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity in mice was evaluated. In addition, the role of GABA-A receptors was examined. The catecholamine antagonists phentolamine, nadolol and propranolol (delivered by a timed-release pellet) respectively exacerbated, partially blocked and had no effect on EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity. Chemical sympathectomy significantly reduced the suppression of NK cell activity by EtOH. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 (mifepristone) did not affect EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity, and exogenous corticosterone only marginally suppressed NK cell activity. The opioid antagonist naltrexone (delivered by a timed-release pellet) did not block suppression of NK cell activity by EtOH. Thus glucocorticoids and opioids are not the major causes of EtOH-induced suppression of NK cell activity, and catecholamines seem only partially responsible for this effect. Involvement of GABA-A receptors was suggested by the ability of Ro15-4513 to decrease EtOH-induced NK suppression. Other agents were less effective, which suggested a possible role for the diazepam-insensitive GABA-A sites that are recognized by Ro15-4513. The failure of diazepam to suppress NK activity also suggests that increased chloride flux through diazepam-sensitive GABA-A receptors (which is caused by EtOH as well as diazepam) does not mediate NK suppression in this model.", 
    "3": "Rats were adapted to a water-deprivation regimen that allowed daily 1-hr drinking sessions of a single fluid, either 1.5% NaCl solution or water. Oral, presession, acute doses of triazolam (0.05-1.6 mg/kg) or alprazolam (0.4-6.4 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in session NaCl solution ingestion. The relative potencies found for these two drugs approximated their relative Ki values reported in the literature. The increased ingestion produced in this and other experiments by anxiolytic agents is presented as an alternative way of evaluating punishment attenuation, and hence anxiolytic activity. Chronic oral dosing (every 2nd day) with triazolam (0.2 mg/kg) or alprazolam (1.2 mg/kg) led, after several weeks, to partial, but surmountable, tolerance to the increased NaCl solution ingestion produced by these drugs, which was confirmed by a rightward shift in the dose-effect relations. During chronic dosing, no corresponding declines in the independently evaluated increases in water intake produced by these drugs occurred. Abrupt drug discontinuation produced a precipitous decrease in NaCl solution intake, with subsequent recovery. For triazolam, the initial discontinuation decrease in intake to below the original base line suggested the possible accrual of a mild physiological dependence under this moderate chronic dose regimen.", 
    "4": "Benzodiazepine agonists affect endocrine responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and can antagonize many of the actions of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Gender and gonad-related factors can influence both the development of tolerance to the benzodiazepines in rats and the concomitant neural adaptations associated with chronic benzodiazepine agonist exposure. This study compared changes in CRF content, corticosterone release and ACTH levels after diazepam exposure in ovariectomized female (OVX) and male rats. After treatment with diazepam for 3 days (acute) or 3 weeks (chronic), content of CRF immunoreactivity in eight brain areas and serum corticosterone were determined by radioimmunoassay in handling-habituated rats. The effects of acute and chronic benzodiazepine exposure on swim stress-induced corticosterone and ACTH release were also examined. Chronic diazepam exposure reduced stress-induced corticosterone and ACTH release in OVX, but not male, rats. Acute diazepam exposure similarly attenuated stress-induced corticosterone release in OVX rats, but did not affect ACTH release. OVX control groups had greater levels of CRF than males in several brain regions. Gender-specific alterations in CRF content after chronic diazepam exposure were observed in amygdala, locus ceruleus and median eminence. Chronic benzodiazepine agonist exposure increased CRF levels in the amygdala of OVX rats, but not males. Both chronic and acute diazepam exposure increased CRF content in the locus ceruleus of male, but not OVX, rats. These results indicate that the effects of benzodiazepine exposure on neural CRF systems are region specific and influenced by gender-related factors.",

Cardiac morbidity (postoperative myocardial ischemia, postoperative myocardial infarction, and perioperative sympathoadrenal stress response), respiratory morbidity (postextubation apnea, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, pulmonary shunting, oxygen consumption, atelectasis, and reintubation), hemodynamic values and vasoactive medication requirements, intraoperative awareness, postoperative cognitive function, 30 day mortality, and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were compared between the two groups.",

Four patients in the conventional group, but not in the early group, had postoperative myocardial infaction. The extubation anesthetics used were effective in suppressing the perioperative plasma catecholamine stress response in both groups. Postextubation apnea characteristics were similar between the groups. Intrapulmonary shunt fraction improved significantly in the early group at 4 hours after extubation. The incidences and degree of atelectasis did not differ significantly between the two groups. The incidences of treated postoperative complications were comparable between the two groups, but three patients in the conventional group died as a result of stroke or postoperative myocardial infarction.",

    "9": "The alpha subunits are an important determinant of the pharmacology of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors with respect to agonists, antagonists, and modulatory compounds, particularly the benzodiazepines. The alpha 4 subunit is the least abundant subunit in the brain and the most similar in deduced primary amino acid sequence to the alpha 6 subunit. We demonstrate that the human alpha 4 subunit forms a functional receptor when expressed with beta gamma 2, demonstrating some properties similar to alpha 6 beta gamma 2 and some properties more akin to alpha 1 beta gamma 2. It also exhibited some properties that were unlike any other alpha subunit-containing receptor. GABA affinity seemed to be identical to that of the alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 receptor; however, the partial agonists 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol and piperidine-4-sulfonic acid showed lower efficacy than at either alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 or alpha 6 beta 1 gamma 2. Benzodiazepine pharmacology of alpha 4-containing receptors was similar to that of alpha 6-containing receptors with the exception of dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, which behaved as a partial inverse agonist. Pentobarbital potentiated alpha 4 beta 1 gamma 2 receptor GABA responses to a level comparable with alpha 6 beta 1 gamma 2 (approximately 700% of EC20); however, unlike alpha 6 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors, it did not elicit any direct activation of the receptor. Propofol also potentiated alpha 4 beta 1 gamma 2 GABA responses but to a level more comparable to that of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2, suggesting that these compounds act via different sites. Unlike other subunit combinations, propofol did not elicit a direct activation of the receptor. These results suggest that the mechanism for direct activation of the GABAA receptor by pentobarbital and propofol is absent on alpha 4-containing receptors. Furosemide, which non-competitively inhibits the GABAA receptor, showed 700-fold selectivity for alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors over alpha 1-, alpha 2-, alpha 3-, and alpha 5-containing receptors and exhibited selectivity for alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors (> 50-fold). These experiments reveal a unique pharmacology for alpha 4-containing receptors with some similarities to both alpha 6- and alpha 1-containing receptors.", 
    "10": "The pharmacological properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor (GABAR) currents recorded from hippocampal dentate granule cells acutely dissociated from 28-35-day-old rats were characterized using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Granule cells were voltage-clamped to 0 mV, and GABA was applied using a modified U-tube rapid-application technique. All granule cells were moderately sensitive to GABA (EC50 = 47 microM). All granule cell GABAR currents were uniformly sensitive to Zn2+ (IC50 = 29 microM), diazepam (EC50 = 158 nM), zolpidem (EC50 = 75 nM), and dimethoxyl-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (IC50 = 60 nM). GABAR currents from only 50% of granule cells were sensitive to loreclezole (EC50 = 9 microM). These data suggest that hippocampal dentate granule cells expressed GABARs with distinctive pharmacological properties of two types: loreclezole-sensitive and -insensitive receptors. It is likely that these distinctive properties were due to the specific GABAR subtypes that assembled to produce distinct granule cell GABAR isoforms.",

Patches were removed at specified times over one week and drug content was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in negative chemical ionization mode using deuterated internal standards. Irrespective of the time of collection, diazepam and nordiazepam were present, but oxazepam was never detected. Drugs were detectable in the 2 to 4-h period following the administration. Peaks of diazepam were obtained during the 48 to 72-h period. After the peak, a decrease of drug concentration was observed. Concentrations were in the range from 0.1 to 6.0 ng/patch for both drugs. After single administration of diazepam (10, 20, or 30 mg), drugs monitored in three groups of three subjects were suggestive to be dose related.

Three groups of evaluators with different laboratory skills and two sets of urine samples from subjects with different rates of drug consumption prevalence were included in the study. Urines were analyzed by the Triage analytical device at the collection site. A second analysis was performed in a toxicology laboratory, and the results were compared with those obtained by FPIA. Nonconcordant results were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and HPLC. Results were independent of the laboratory skills of the evaluators. The agreement for each drug calculated for two populations with differences in prevalence of drug consumption was almost the same, except for benzodiazepines. No differences between Triage and FPIA results were observed for samples clearly over or under cutoff concentrations. Globally, the Triage device, in a clinical situation, demonstrated performance comparable with that of an instrument-based immunoassay and, in some cases (e.g., for benzodiazepines), the Triage performance was even better.",

The HPLC method uses isocratic elution with acetonitrile:methanol:dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 10 nmol/L, pH 3.7 (30:2:100 by vol), at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min to separate the drugs. We detect the benzodiazepines with diode-array detector at 240 nm; analyses of peak purity are performed at 210-365 nm. The recoveries were between 94% and 100%. The intraassay and interassay CVs were between 1.0% and 4.1%. The detection limit is 5 nmol/L. The antiepileptic and antidepressant drugs tested did not interfere with the assay.

    "21": "There is evidence to suggest that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are involved in porphyrin transport during erythroid differentiation, and it is possible that these receptors have an important role in heme biosynthesis. We examined the biochemical and ultrastructural alterations in rat liver following experimentally induced acute hepatic porphyria, as well as the effects of the administration of a selective PBR ligand, PK 11195. The most severe pathological conditions were found in rats that received a combined treatment of the porphyrinogenic agent 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4- dihydrocollidine (DDC) and PK 11195. Transmission electron microscopy showed a correlation between the ultrastructural pathology of the liver, the total porphyrin levels in urine and liver, and the porphobilinogen levels in urine. Hepatocytes in this acute porphyria showed the development of large secondary lysosomes containing crystalline aggregates of protoporphyrin. Bile canaliculi were grossly enlarged, contained aggregates of protoporphyrin crystals, and showed the presence of bile thrombi. In addition, prominent bundles of collagen fibers (fibrosis) were commonly found in livers of rats that had been treated with DDC or DDC and PK 11195. We conclude that the administration of PK 11195 to porphyric rats aggravates porphyrin accumulation and cellular damage in the liver. Perhaps this evidence suggests that PK 11195 blocks the binding of protoporphyrin IX to PBR, thus elevating the content of protoporphyrin IX in liver.", 
    "22": "Neuropsychological tests used for the assessment of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (SHE) may overdiagnose SHE because scores are usually not corrected for age. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SHE using two easy administrable psychometric tests (Number Connection Test part A [NCT-A], Symbol Digit Test [SDT]) with age-related normal values. In addition, spectral electroencephalogram (EEG) was used, which is the in-house electrophysiological method for quantifying encephalopathy. One hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients (mean age 49 years, range 17-77) with cirrhosis without any clinical signs of encephalopathy, were screened for SHE. In addition, the Child-Pugh score and the arterial blood ammonia were determined. Patients with concurrent use of alcohol, benzodiazepines or anti-epileptics were excluded. Fifty percent of the patients had an abnormal NCT according to the standard recommended procedure, in contrast only 7% of the patients had an abnormal NCT when scores corrected for age were used. Combining the results of the spectral EEG and the psychometric tests corrected for age yielded a higher prevalence of SHE (23%) than when each test method was used alone (17% vs. 10% abnormal, respectively). Severity of liver disease correlated with the presence of SHE, because the prevalence of abnormal tests increased from 14% in Child-Pugh grade A to 45% in Child-Pugh grade B or C. Age above 40 years and an elevated blood ammonia level were significant determinants related to an abnormal EEG. We conclude that the NCT uncorrected for age markedly overdiagnoses SHE and, therefore, should not be used as a test for the screening of SHE. Using a combination of spectral EEG and two psychometric tests with age-corrected normal values a low prevalence of SHE in patients with Child A liver cirrhosis is found. Older patients with an elevated arterial ammonia are more prone to develop SHE than younger patients with an equal arterial ammonia concentration.", 
    "23": "While expert recommendations caution against long-term benzodiazepine use in the elderly, survey data suggest increasing benzodiazepine use with age. Computerized pharmacy records of staff-model HMO were used to examine benzodiazepine prescribing. Six-month prevalence of benzodiazepine use (2.8%) and prevalence of continued use (0.7%) were lower than earlier reports. Prevalence was higher in women and increased steadily with age. Among 7012 patients beginning benzodiazepine treatment, duration of use increased with patient age, prescription by a psychiatrist (vs. primary care or medical/surgical specialist), use of higher-potency drugs (lorazepam, and alprazolem, clonazepam) and larger number of pills in the initial prescription. Individual physicians varied significantly in drug choice, initial prescription size, and likelihood of chronic use. Among 200 patients treated in primary care, the physician-recorded indication for prescription was anxiety or depression in 27%, insomnia in 20%, and pain symptoms in 38%. These findings indicate a gap between benzodiazepine efficacy research and current clinical practice.",

Enzyme activity was assayed in the presence of 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.00 microM thiopental, ketamine, etomidate, midazolam, and phenytoin. Thiopental (P = 0.001), ketamine (P = 0.0002), midazolam (P = 0.0024), and etomidate (P = 0.0006) caused a decrease in nitric oxide synthase activity. Phenytoin had no effect on enzyme activity.

The HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-transactivating protein Tat enhances apoptosis and activation-induced cell death (AICD) of human T cells. This effect is mediated by the CD95 (APO-1/Fas) receptor-CD95 ligand (CD95L) system and may be linked to the induction of oxidative stress by Tat. Here we show that HIV-1 Tat-induced oxidative stress is necessary for sensitized AICD in T cells caused by CD95L expression. Tat-enhanced apoptosis and CD95L expression in T cells are inhibited by neutralizing anti-Tat antibodies, antioxidants, and the Tat inhibitor Ro24-7429. Chimpanzees infected with HIV-1 show viral replication resembling early infection in humans but do not show T-cell depletion or progression towards AIDS. The cause for this discrepancy is unknown. Here we show that unlike Tat-treated T cells in humans, Tat-treated chimpanzee T cells do not show downregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase or signs of oxidative stress. Chimpanzee T cells are also resistant to Tat-enhanced apoptosis, AICD, and CD95L upregulation.",

Like N-oxide metabolites of other drugs, demoxepam cannot be detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), due to thermal decomposition, and the product, nordiazepam, is a metabolite common to many benzodiazepines. Demoxepam can be readily screened using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system such as REMEDi HS; at 35 degrees C, no thermal decomposition will occur. Currently, there is no confirmation method available for the detection of demoxepam in urine samples. In this study, we demonstrated that following collection of the HPLC fraction, demoxepam can be confirmed using the technique of direct-probe MS. The mass spectra of demoxepam and nordiazepam differ and are easily distinguishable from each other. Ten urine samples that were analyzed by HPLC and determined to contain demoxepam were evaluated; demoxepam was confirmed in each case by direct-probe MS.",

    "37": "The \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been reported to play a role in many biological processes. We have synthesized and tested a novel series of PBR ligands based on a pyrrolobenzoxazepine skeleton, in order to provide new receptor ligands. Several of these new compounds proved to be high affinity and selective ligands for PBR, and benzoxazepines 17f and 17j were found to be the most potent ligands for this receptor to have been identified to date. The SAR and the molecular modeling studies detailed herein delineated a number of structural features required for improving affinity. Some of the ligands were employed as \"molecular yardsticks\" to probe the spatial dimensions of the lipophilic pockets L1 and L3 in the PBR cleft and to determine the effect of occupation of L1 and L3 with respect to affinity, while other C-7 modified analogues provided information specifically on the hydrogen bonding with a putative receptor site H1. The new pyrrolobenzoxazepines were tested in rat cortex, a tissue expressing high density of mitochondrial PBR, and exhibited IC50 and Ki values in the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range, as measured by the displacement of [3H]PK 11195 binding. A subset of the highest affinity ligands was also found to have high affinities for [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding in rat adrenal mitochondria. All the ligands in this subset are stimulators of steroidogenesis having similar potency and extent of stimulation as PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 of steroidogenesis in the mouse Y-1 adrenocortical cell line.", 
    "38": "Three major populations of GABAA receptor binding sites are present in cerebellar membranes: diazepam-sensitive [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites, diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites and high-affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites. All three populations contain a beta subunit as shown by immunoprecipitation with antibodies that recognize all beta subunits. The beta 3 subtype of beta subunit is contained in all three populations, but only a similar low fraction (< 20%) in each. Thus, the majority contain beta subunits other than beta 3 (beta 2 and beta 1) and beta 3 subunits are not selectively associated with nor lacking in any of the three binding populations. Antibodies to the gamma 2 subunit precipitated similar fractions of [3H]Ro15-4513, [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding sites, showing that gamma 2 subunits are present in high-affinity muscimol binding isoforms, as well as a significant fraction of the diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites. Under conditions that identify the 56 kDa alpha 6 subunit on SDS-PAGE as the diazepam insensitive site of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding in cerebellum, no polypeptide showing diazepam-insensitive binding of [3H]Ro15-4513 could be photoaffinity-labeled in rat thalamus. These results suggest that alpha 4 subunits in the thalamus participate primarily in subunit combinations which bind muscimol but not any benzodiazepine site ligands.", 
    "39": "Radioligand binding assays have been previously used to predict the relative efficacy of novel ligands. In the present study we have investigated whether for the cholecystokinin CCK-A receptors in the rat pancreas, the ratio of binding affinities for compounds for antagonist and agonist radioligands are predictive of functional activity. A number of classical cholecystokinin agonists, such as CCK-8S, caerulein, CCK-8DS, pentagastrin and CCK-4 had antagonist/agonist binding ratios of 4-fold or greater. All compounds behaved as full agonists in the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover and increase in amylase secretion in rat pancreas. In contrast, compounds such as the benzodiazepine derivatives devazepide and L-365,260 had binding ratios of less than one and lacked agonist activity in either functional assay. Interestingly, the dipeptide derivative CI-988, which has been described as a selective CCK-B antagonist, was found to have an antagonist/agonist binding ratio of 1.5 for the CCK-A receptors in rat pancreas which was sufficiently high for this compound to behave as a full agonist in the amylase assay, although CI-988 did not exhibit agonist activity in the PI assay. These results suggest that the effective receptor reserve in the amylase assay is greater than that required to stimulate PI turnover, and that the selective peptoid CCK-B antagonist CI-988 has weak agonist activity at CCK-A receptors.",

Polysomnographic recordings and core body temperature recordings revealed that melatonin, either in combination with placebo or with flumazenil, significantly increased the amounts of sleep, and decreased core body temperature in comparison with placebo alone or the combination of flumazenil plus placebo. These results do not support the hypothesis that melatonin exerts its hypothermic and hypnotic effects via the central benzodiazepine receptors.",

Data on 2928 consecutive patients were collected by questionnaire and ten quality indicators assessed: concordance with the indication list; intestinal cleansing; premedication; duration and completeness of the study; sensation of pain; use of radiology; complications; diagnosis; and therapeutic intervention.", 
    "43": "Concordance with the indication list was present in 97.8% (range 93-100), premedication was given to 94.6% (77-100), midazolam to 77%. The proportion of patients who recorded no or only moderate pain correlated with the dose but not with the duration of advancing the coloscope. Mean time of advancing the instrument to the caecum was 8.0 min, the duration directly depending on the experience of the examiner. A mean time of less than 10 minutes was achieved only after more than 1200 examinations. The more a centre used fluoroscopic control the shorter the time of coloscopy. The examination was completed in 97.6% (92-99). There was no correlation between experience (assuming supervision) and dose of midazolam or frequency of fluoroscopy.",

    "45": "The anxiolytic-like effects of a variety of 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists have been intensively studied in animal models. However, no direct effects of agents modulating 5-HT4 receptors have been reported, in spite of their suggestive location in the brain. The objective of the present study was the determination of the effects of two selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists, SB 204070 [1-butyl-4-piperidinylmethyl)-8-amino-7-chloro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxylate] and GR 113808 [[1-[2-methylsulphonyl)amino]ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]methyl 1-methyl-1 H-indole-3-carboxylate], in the elevated plus-maze test in rats. Results have shown that both 5-HT4 receptor antagonists exhibit an anxiolytic-like profile, although only at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg (s.c.). At this dose, both compounds significantly increased the percentage of time spent in open arms exploration, while other variables evaluated remained unaffected at the dose range tested. Results suggest that 5-HT4 receptor antagonists could have some anxiolytic-like properties, although their effects seem more limited and less consistent than those presented by classic anxiolytics, such as diazepam. However, they are similar to those exhibited by granisetron [endo-1-methyl-N-(9-methyl-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-yl)-1 H-indazole-3-carboxamide], a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.",

Following memorization of a list of abstract visual stimuli (Fourier), subjects were evaluated on recognition performance immediately following acquisition and after a 3-day drug clearance interval. Administration of 15 mg diazepam 1 h before acquisition imposed a significant (10-24%) deficit only in delayed recognition. In contrast, a drug-free acquisition followed by a diazepam-challenged delayed recognition did not influence recognition. Moreover, 1 h after administration, diazepam did not significantly impair detection or visual discriminative performances. Given the persistence of an important deficit in recognition memory in the absence of any drug, this paradigm promises to be useful for studying regional cerebral blood flow during long-term memory performance.",

    "54": "The ability of anticholinergic agents microinjected into the subthalamic nucleus to reduce reserpine-induced muscular rigidity was assessed in rats. The electromyographical activity of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle was used as a parameter of muscular rigidity. Reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.) produced the appearance of electromyographical activity. The muscarinic antagonists M3 (1.27 nmol of 4-DAMP) and M1 (2.36 nmol of pirenzepine) markedly reduced the reserpine-induced electromyographical activity, whereas the M2 antagonist AFDX-116 (2.37 nmol) had no effect. These results suggest that a high cholinergic tone in the subthalamic nucleus is associated with the reserpine-induced muscular rigidity. Moreover, the M3 muscarinic antagonist is more effective than the M1 muscarinic antagonist in reducing the muscular rigidity in reserpinized rats, a model of Parkinson's disease, by blocking the high cholinergic tone in the subthalamic nucleus.", 
    "55": "We have previously shown, using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, that astrocytes release a negative allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA receptor) with beta-carboline-like properties, thus, likely to act at the benzodiazepine site. Here, using patch-clamp and binding techniques, we confirm that the low-molecular-weight fraction of astroglia-conditioned medium (ACM lmf) contains a factor(s) that negatively modulates GABAA-receptor function. This factor, like beta-carbolines, enhances the specific binding of [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to adult rat cortical membranes in the presence of GABA. However, it fails to interact with various ligands of the benzodiazepine (BZD) site of the GABAA receptor ([3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]Ro 15-1788 and [3H]Ro 15-4513). The question of the actual binding site of the astroglia-derived factor on the GABAA receptor, thus, remains open and can be addressed only after the purification of the active molecule(s) of ACM Imf has been completed, and a labeled form of the endogenous ligand becomes available. Taken together, however, the data suggest that type 1 astrocytes are able to modulate the effects of the main inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system.", 
    "56": "Midazolam, amphetamine, and flesinoxan were used in four rat experiments to examine the usefulness of a latent Pavlovian discrimination procedure to assess the discriminative-stimulus, or occasion-setting, properties of drugs. Experiment 1 first assessed the unconditioned effect of each of the drugs on the dependent measure used, which was immobility. Relative to saline, midazolam enhanced immobility, whereas flesinoxan, and especially amphetamine decreased it. In each of the Experiments 2-4, subjects received a limited number of training sessions during which they consistently received a footshock in a distinctive box after a drug but not after saline, or vice versa. Subsequently, non-reinforced test sessions were performed in the drug and saline states in both the conditioning box and a novel box. Relative to the saline state, rats previously shocked under midazolam were less mobile in the conditioning box under midazolam, whereas rats previously not shocked under amphetamine or flesinoxan were more mobile under the drug. The remaining animals did not show differential responding. The response profiles were accounted for in terms of the combined operation of an associative, or occasion-setting, effect and a non-associative effect of the drug-induced states.", 
    "57": "Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) is a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) method which correlates precalculated fields surrounding a set of molecules with some target property. Among others, the electrostatic fields are commonly used. These are usually generated by calculating the Coulomb potential between a probe and the molecules bearing atom-centered point charges. The present study was performed in order to investigate up to which extent different methods to calculate electrostatic potentials can influence the results of a CoMFA. Therefore, a variety of charge calculation methods was applied to a data set consisting of 37 ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist-antagonist active site. These methods included Gasteiger-Marsili, semiempirical (MNDO, AM1, and PM3), and ab initio (HF/STO-3G, HF/3-21G*, and HF/6-31G*) charges. Semiempirical as well as ab initio electron populations were derived both from the Mulliken population analysis (MPA) or from fitting the charges to the molecular electrostatic potential (ESPFIT charges). In addition, the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) resulting from ab initio calculations were mapped directly onto the CoMFA grid. With regard to the cross-validated r(2) values (r(2) cv ) of the resulting QSAR models, the ESPFIT-derived potentials yielded generally higher r(2) cv values than those resulting from MPA charges. For example, at the HF/3-21G* level the r(2) cv rose from 0.61 (MPA-derived potentials) to 0.76 (ESPFIT fields). The MEPs mapped directly onto the CoMFA grid were not superior to the corresponding ESPFIT-derived potentials. Semiempirical ESPFIT charges appeared to be of similar quality compared with ab initio ESPFIT electron populations in the CoMFAs. When no scaling between the steric and electrostatic descriptor matrices was applied, the electrostatic contributions were influenced to a high degree by the magnitude of the corresponding field values. \u00a9 1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "67": "This article reviews literature on morphological and functional neuro-imaging data in refractory partial epilepsies of adults including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Single Photon Emission Computerised Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Except for MRI, which is of unquestionable utility in the diagnosis of epileptogenic lesions, most of these investigations are justified only in the context of pre-operative evaluation of candidates to functional neurosurgery. In terms of interpretation the key issue is that of the relation between the images and the epileptogenic process itself. The specific utility of available techniques is as follows: MRI, in its present state of development, reveals a morphological abnormality in more than 80% of the cases previously considered as cryptogenic on the basis of X ray Computerised Tomography. However, hippocampal atrophy, which has a questionable relation with temporal lobe seizures, represents two thirds of abnormal images. Functional MRI and MR spectroscopy represent potential alternatives respectively to Wada test and interictal SPECT or PET. Ictal blood flow studies during video-EEG monitoring represent the major application of SPECT; showing a focal increase of blood flow in more than 90% of cases. Interictal SPECT is less informative, but necessary for interpreting ictal images. 18F-Deoxyglucose (FDG) PET shows a focal interictal hypometabolism in nearly 90% of patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The incidence of interictal hypometabolism is less, though more than 50%, in the other types of partial epilepsies. For diagnostic purpose PET studies of benzodiazepine (BZD)-receptors with 11C-Flumazenil are more widely used than those of opiate or mucarinic receptors. The reduced density of BZD receptors is likely to reflect neuronal loss, whereas interictal glucose hypometabolism reflects both the lesional process and secondary deactivation of perilesional areas due to anatomical or functional deafferentation.",

We report here the effects of androgenic/anabolic steroids (AAS) on the binding of the PBR-specific ligand [3H] PK11195 to male rat brain cortical synaptoneurosomes. Two synthetic AAS, stanozolol and 17beta-testosterone cypionate (17beta-cyp), significantly inhibited 1 nM [3H] PK11195 binding at concentrations greater than 5 and 25 microM, respectively. Stanozolol was the most effective inhibitor, reducing [3H] PK11195 binding by up to 75%, compared to only 40% inhibition by 17beta-cyp, at 50 microM AAS concentration. Two other AAS, 17alpha-methyltestosterone and nortestosterone decanoate, were incapable of inhibiting [3H] PK11195 binding at concentrations up to 50 microM. On the basis of Scatchard/Rosenthal analysis, [3H] PK11195 binds to two classes of binding sites, and the inhibition of [3H] PK11195 binding by stanozolol appears to be allosteric, primarily reducing binding to the higher affinity [3H] PK11195 binding site. These results, in combination with earlier studies indicating the direct effects of AAS on the function of additional central nervous system receptor complexes, suggest that the behavioral and psychological effects of AAS result from the interactions of AAS with multiple regulatory systems in the brain.",

    "76": "Zinc (Zn2+) was shown to invariably inhibit muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake by synaptoneurosomes in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. The Zn2+ sensitivity of the GABAA receptor-gated 36Cl- uptake in the cerebral cortex was comparable to that in the hippocampus, whereas the uptake in the cerebellum was less sensitive to Zn2+. Although diazepam-potentiation of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake was unaltered by 100 microM Zn2+ in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, diazepam caused no enhancement in the presence of Zn2+ in the cerebellum. Zn2+ inhibited [3H]diazepam binding significantly at 1 mM in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, whereas Ni2+ increased the binding in a concentration-dependent manner in both regions. Although lower concentrations of Zn2+ did not affect [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to diazepam-sensitive sites, higher concentrations of ZN2+ increased the binding in both regions. Unlike the diazepam-sensitive sites, the diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was not affected by Zn2+ or Ni2+ at any of the tested concentrations. These results suggest that the GABAA ligand-gated Cl- flux and its diazepam-potentiation are heterogeneously modulated in various brain regions. It is also suggested that cerebellar diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites are insensitive to Zn2+ and Ni2+.", 
    "77": "The contractile responses obtained by activation of different muscarinic receptor subtypes in the longitudinal muscle of the rat ileum and especially the responses of this muscle to acetylcholine in a Ca(2+)-free medium have been investigated. In Ca(2+)-containing solution, acetylcholine elicited similar concentration-dependent contractile responses in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum strips of the rat intestine. The response to a maximal concentration of the agonist (1 microM) consisted of a rapid phasic response followed by a slower tonic one. Nifedipine completely relaxes or inhibits the sustained response and only partially diminishes the phasic one, which suggests that the phasic contraction depends on the release of internal Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, but that the tonic contraction only depends on the influx of the external ion. In Ca(2+)-free medium, acetylcholine (1 microM) induced phasic contractions that depend on the release of this ion from internal stores. Participation of different subtypes of receptors (M1, M2 and M3) in these responses depends on the inhibitory action shown by methoctramine, 4-DAMP and atropine but not by pirenzepine in two different experimental models.",

Solidification from melts, investigated by differential scanning calorimetry using cooling cycles, showed a tendency of the drugs, carriers or their dispersions to supercool. The degree of supercooling depended on the rate of cooling, the drug content and, for the PEGs, on the molecular weight. PEG 1500 and PEG 2000 gave one morphological form, irrespective of cooling rate; PEG 4000 and PEG 6000 solidified into at least two forms, depending on the cooling rate. Incorporation of drugs affected the morphology of the PEGs during solidification. The rate of crystal growth was, furthermore, influenced by the fusion temperature, molecular weight and the degree of supercooling. The degree of crystallinity, as measured by the enthalpies of solidification, decreased with increasing cooling rate. The results show that reducing the rate of solidification could lead to incomplete solidification, giving products that are liable to change on storage.",

Diazepam but not majonoside-R2 exhibited a protective activity against convulsion caused by the GABAA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin.

YM022 potently inhibited [125I]CCK-8 binding to the membrane with an IC50 of 55 pM and CCK-8-induced Ca2+ mobilization with that of 7.4 nM. On the other hand, its racemate and enantiomer more weakly inhibited this binding (IC50 of 110 pM and 11 nM, respectively) and Ca2+ mobilization (IC50 of 18 nM and 94 nM, respectively). These results indicate that YM022 stereoselectively recognizes the human CCKB/gastrin receptor as a potent antagonist and that the established transfectant is useful for characterization of human CCKB/gastrin-receptor ligands.",

When compared with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the tricyclic compound clomipramine has a higher incidence of adverse effects but is well tolerated by most OCD patients and may confer the best overall antiobsessional effects. Consideration of specific adverse effect profiles, special patient population characteristics, drug interactions and relative cost of the various agents may direct clinicians in choosing the most appropriate first-line drug. Alternative agents as monotherapies have been explored, but none has consistently proven effective to date. Investigations of SRI augmentation with serotonin-enhancing agents have also failed to demonstrate substantial benefits for treatment-refractory OCD. Combination treatment with SRIs and dopamine receptor antagonist drugs appears to provide an improved response for the subpopulation of OCD patients who have comorbid 'tic-spectrum' disorders, though large-scale studies of the efficacy and tolerability of these regimens are not yet available.", 
    "87": "In a retrospective study, 124 patients with depression who were concomitantly receiving ECT and benzodiazepines were compared with patients (matched for age, sex, diagnosis, and laterality of ECT) receiving ECT without benzodiazepines in order to investigate the efficacy of ECT in terms of therapeutic response and length of stay in hospital. Most of the subjects (84% of cases and 89% of controls) improved on ECT, but the benzodiazepine group of patients receiving unilateral ECT showed a significantly poorer response and a longer stay in hospital. No such difference was detected with the bilateral ECT. It is therefore concluded that prescription of benzodiazepines with ECT does compromise the therapeutic effect of unilateral ECT for depression.", 
    "88": "A key issue in the debate on suicide prevention is the extent to which suicide rates are affected by the availability of means of committing suicide. The aim of this study was to analyse the changes in rates of suicides committed by poisoning in Sweden between 1969 and 1992, and to determine to what extent these were associated with changes in the prescribing of medicines. We compared suicide rates from 1969 to 1992 with trends in the sales of antidepressants, barbiturates, neuroleptics and analgesics during the same period. The incidence of suicide by poisoning decreased during the 1970s, especially in younger and middle-aged men. This was mainly due to a decrease in suicides by barbiturate poisoning, which closely followed a decrease in sales of barbiturates. Sales of analgesics and antidepressants increased during the study period, and so did the rates of suicide using these drugs. We conclude that the availability of medicines is an important factor influencing suicide rates, and that changes in the prescribing of medicines may influence suicide rates.",

    "92": "Altogether 855 drug misusers were identified from various sources within Dundee; many were identified from more than one source. Using this data, the estimated unknown population was 1702, giving a total population of 2557 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1974, 3458) who misuse benzodiazepines or opiates. This represents a prevalence of 28.8 (95% CI 22.3, 39.0) per thousand.", 
    "93": "Capture-recapture techniques can be applied to statutory and non-statutory agency data to produce an estimate of at least certain sections of the drug misusing population. However, it is important to recognise the limitations of this methodology and in future to seek to combine a range of approaches to the problem of estimating prevalence rather than sticking rigidly to any single approach.", 
    "94": "In the present study, post-trial effects of clonazepam and diazepam on inhibitory avoidance learning under two different experimental conditions (i.e., 0.25 or 0.75 mA footshock) have been investigated. Both clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 and 8 mg/kg) enhanced retention when administered immediately after the 0.25 mA footshock applied during training of the inhibitory avoidance task. In contrast, clonazepam and diazepam proved ineffective after the 0.75 mA footshock. The results suggest a post-training memory-enhancing effect of clonazepam and diazepam depending on the experimental conditions.", 
    "95": "This study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive effects of one of the most prescribed benzodiazepines (BZ) -i.e., alprazolam. Groups of CD-1, SWISS, BALB/c and C57BL mice were treated with alprazolam. Analgesia was assayed, using the radiant heat tailflick assay. Alprazolam given i.p. elicited analgesia in a dose-dependent manner only in the BALB/c mice (ED50 1.1 mg/kg). No analgesia was observed in CD-1 or C57BL mice. The sensitivity of SWISS mice was intermediate, but still very low. Intrathecally administered alprazolam elicited analgesia in BALB/c, Swiss and CD-1 mice with ED50 values of 10, 22.8 and 34.6 micrograms, respectively. No analgesia was observed in C57BL mice. Intracerebroventricular injections did not induce analgesia in any of the strains. In other sets of experiments with BALB/c mice, we found a supra-additivity increase in analgesia when a subthreshold dose of alprazolam was given with morphine (mu-subtype agonist). This interaction was antagonized by naloxone and less so by flumazenil. No effect was found when alprazolam was co-administered with other specific opioid agonists (delta and kappa). Our results demonstrate that injections of alprazolam can produce analgesia in different genetic subjects and can modify morphine-induced antinociception. The fact that the interaction between morphine and alprazolam analgesia was sensitive to naloxone but less to flumazenil indicates that the analgesic effects of alprazolam are mediated primarily by an opioid mechanism of action but less by benzodiazepines.", 
    "96": "Zopiclone is a new short half-life cyclopyrrolone hypnotic agent acting at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. In order to characterize its pharmacological profile, the effects of 7.5 mg zopiclone on nocturnal melatonin secretion were investigated under polysomnographic control in 11 healthy subjects following acute and subchronic administration as well as after abrupt discontinuation of the drug. No effect of zopiclone on the melatonin plasma levels could be observed. Regarding both total melatonin production and the temporal pattern of melatonin secretion during the night, there was no difference between placebo baseline condition, acute and subchronic administration, and discontinuation. In contrast, the sleep EEG data demonstrated the hypnotic efficacy of zopiclone under acute administration and indicated a rebound insomnia after abrupt discontinuation. Moreover, alterations of sleep architecture were found under treatment as well as after discontinuation. Whereas, with regard to sleep EEG parameters, zopiclone appears to be comparable with some short-acting benzodiazepines, a discrepancy between the missing effect of zopiclone on pineal function and the suppressing influence of benzodiazepines known from the literature becomes obvious. The fact that zopiclone does not interfere with nocturnal melatonin secretion at pharmacologically active doses as indicated by alterations in sleep EEG parameters might possibly point to a pharmacodynamic difference between the two drug classes.", 
    "97": "Iomazenil is a specific ligand for central-type benzodiazepine receptors (BZR). In order to determine the clinical significance of the findings of 123I-iomazenil single photon emission tomography (SPET) in cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we compared the cerebral uptake of 123I-iomazenil with oxygen metabolism measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Depending on the severity of the haemodynamic and/or metabolic impairment based on our institutional criteria [a reduction of < 30.6 ml 100g-1 min-1 in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and an increase of > 0.52 in the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)], the cortical areas were classified into four groups as follows: Group I, normal CBF and OEF; Group II, normal CBF and increased OEF; Group III, reduced CBF and normal OEF; Group IV, reduced CBF and increased OEF. Seven patients (mean age 65 +/- 7 years) with CVD underwent both PET and 123I-iomazenil SPET within 8 days. The ratios of the mean counts in 14 regions of interest in the cerebral cortices to those in the cerebellar cortices (R/C ratios) were compared with the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). The R/C ratios of Group IV were lower than those of Group I (P < 0.005). The R/C ratios correlated with CMRO2 in Group III (r = 0.577, P < 0.01) and in Group IV (r = 0.707, P < 0.005), but not in Groups I or II. These results suggests that reduced uptake in 123I-iomazenil SPET reflects oxidative hypometabolism causing neuronal damage in haemodynamically and metabolically impaired areas in patients with CVD. This information may be valuable when deciding therapeutic approaches.", 
    "98": "A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the determination of droperidol concentrations in plasma. Following extraction, separation of droperidol and the internal standard flurazepam was achieved with a Spherisorb Nitrile, 5 microns, S5CN 250 mm x 4.6 mm column at 200 nm. The mobile phase was phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 2.4), acetonitrile and ethanol (65:20:15, v/v/v). The assay was rapid, sensitive and linear over the range 2-4000 ng ml-1. Precision of the assay expressed as the intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (%RSD) did not exceed 10%. Flunitrazepam, midazolam and nitrazepam were also resolved with this technique and did not interfere with droperidol or flurazepam. Resolution of all five compounds was complete in less than 6 min. The assay was used to study the pharmacokinetics of high dose droperidol infusions during and after cardiac surgery.", 
    "99": "Previous studies have shown a lorazepam effect on visual perception. We tested whether this impairment resulted from a peripheral effect induced by benzodiazepines. A first experiment showed that a single dose of lorazepam induces an oculomotor imbalance without impairing visual acuity or accommodation. In a second experiment, we tested whether the impairment induced by lorazepam on visual perception still occurred in monocular vision. Subjects matched incomplete forms controlled on the spacing and alignment of their local contour elements. A reference object was first displayed and followed by two laterally displayed objects, a target and a distractor. The distractor was the mirror-reversed version of the target. Performance was impaired in the lorazepam group when the reference was an incomplete form with a spacing of 10.8' or 22.2' of arc. These results were not correlated with sedation. They confirm that lorazepam has a central deleterious effect on visual perception. A post-hoc analysis also suggested that lorazepam-treated subjects used asymmetry in the stimuli as a compensatory strategy. This result is discussed in relation to previous hypotheses about the physiological mechanisms that determine the effects of lorazepam on visual perception.", 
    "100": "The effects of NBQX (1.56-7.5 mg/kg, i.p.), a competitive antagonist at the AMPA type of glutamate receptor, were studied in two operant behavioural paradigms, differential reinforcement of low response rates (DRL), and delayed matching to position (DMTP), which have been shown to be sensitive to the antagonists of the NMDA type of glutamate receptor. Additionally, the non-competitive AMPA antagonist, GYKI 52466 (7.5-15 mg/kg, i.p.), was studied in the DRL procedure. As a positive control, the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, MK 801 (0.0125-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) was studied in both procedures. During performance of the DRL schedule, MK 801 increased response rates in a dose dependent manner, and decreased the number of reinforcers obtained. The increase in response rates could be attributed to both a shift in the median inter-response time (IRT) to shorter intervals, and to a marked, dose dependent increase in the occurrence of bursts of responses (responses occurring within 3 s of a previous response). In contrast, NBQX and GYKI 52466 both decreased response rates in a dose dependent fashion, and did not shift the distribution of the IRTs, or increase the occurrence of burst responding. In the DMTP procedure, accuracy of matching decreased with increasing delay (up to 30 s, between presentation of sample and opportunity to respond). NBQX disrupted responding at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, but lower doses were ineffective in influencing accuracy of performance of the discrimination. In contrast, MK 801 (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) reduced accuracy of matching at all delays, while tending to increase the speed of responding. These data demonstrate differences in the effects of AMPA and NMDA antagonists on performance of well trained operant behaviour.", 
    "101": "The effects of midazolam on animal behavior often are evaluated under a chronically food-limited regimen, which is used to implement food-reinforced performance, but the corresponding pharmacokinetics are lacking. The present study investigated the pharmacokinetics of midazolam after i.v., s.c., i.p., and p.o. administration in food-limited rates. A two-compartment model best described the concentration-time profiles for the four routes of administration. The rate of midazolam absorption was rapid, and peak concentrations were attained in less than 7 min for the three extravascular routes. The mean volume of distribution of the central compartment and clearance were 0.77 l/kg and 2.03 l/h per keg, respectively. Midazolam elimination half-lives for the four routes of administration ranged from 23.1 to 49.5 min, and metabolites could not be detected. The mean absolute bioavailability was route-dependent: 39.3% (s.c.) 19.2% (i.p.) and 4.6% (p.o.). The markedly low oral bioavailability found in food-limited rats contrasted to the value reported for free-feeding rates (45%). Although the i.p. route yielded the highest maximum concentration on occasion, serum midazolam concentration-time profiles were variable, but did correspond to respective sedative responses. DRL 45-s performance after s.c., i.p., and p.o. administration further supported the advisability of using the s.c. route of administration, as opposed to the i.p. route, for studying midazolam dose-response relations. The bioavailability values assessed from DRL performance also agree with the measured pharmacokinetic values.", 
    "102": "There is increasing interest in the potential functional role of the octapeptide angiotensin II (AII) in psychiatric and cognitive disorders. The novel angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists, losartan and PD123177, selective for the AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes respectively, constitute important pharmacological tools for the assessment of the behavioural consequences of modulation of AII function. The present series of studies investigated the effects of each compound in two animal models of anxiety, the rat elevated zero-maze and mouse light/dark box, and two models of working memory in the rat, the operant delayed matching to position (DMTP) task and the spatial reinforced alternation test in the T-maze. Our data indicate that both compounds (0.01-10 mg/kg s.c.) were without significant effect in any of the behavioural assays. Using the present methods and strains of laboratory rodents, these findings provide no support for the involvement of AII receptor function in the mediation of anxiety of working memory.",

In this study, the effects of anesthesia on the modulation of the GABAA receptor complex by ethanol, a benzodiazepine, and a barbiturate were determined. In vivo administration of the anesthetic methoxyflurane and CO2 before sacrifice resulted in a decrease in Cl- flux in mouse brain microsacs. These treatments also resulted in the loss of the ability of the GABAA receptor modulatory agents flunitrazepam and ethanol to enhance the Cl- flux in this assay system.",

No premedication was administered. Laser coagulation was performed with the Myriadlase side-firing fiber using a standard Sharplan neodymium: YAG laser source at 40 W power setting, and 650 (516-1000) J/g of prostate tissue was delivered. Patient acceptance was favorable. All remained relaxed, cooperative, and without pain during the procedure. None of the patients required any further anesthesia. There was no significant change in blood pressure, pulse rate, or peripheral oxygen saturation measurements during the procedure. Any patient who feels comfortable with a diagnostic cystoscopy being performed using intraurethral gel anesthesia should find this anesthesia protocol acceptable for laser coagulation of the prostate.",

Clinical signs include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course, and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist followed by opioids or benzodiazepines.", 
    "106": "1. General anaesthetic agents prevent awareness of sensory input and subsequent recall of sensory events after administration. The mechanisms involved in higher sensory processing, including awareness and recall, are not fully elucidated. However, fast oscillations in neuronal activity in the 20-80 Hz (gamma) range have been strongly implicated. Here we have investigated the effects of two anaesthetic agents and a sedative/hypnotic drug on these oscillations. 2. Trains of fast oscillations, shown previously to be shaped by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor activation, were evoked by pressure ejection of L-glutamate (10 nM) onto the perisomatic region of hippocampal area CAI in the presence of 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (R-CPP), 50 microM, 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX), 50 microM and 2-hydroxysaclofen, 0.2 mM. 3. Thiopentone (10-200 microM) and propofol (0.5-10 microM) dose-dependently decreased both the maximum oscillation frequency, by approx. 90%, and the incidence of evoked rhythmic oscillations by approx. 60%. Diazepam (0.05-1 microM) decreased maximum oscillation frequency by about 40% but did not affect the incidence of evoked oscillations. 4. The similar effects of thiopentone and propofol were mediated by both a large (about 600%) increase in the decay constant (tau D) of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (i.p.s.cs) and a bicuculline-sensitive leak current. The two drugs had differing effects on i.p.s.c. amplitude. Diazepam caused a small increase in tau D (about 170%) and did not alter leak currents at the doses used. 5. Effects of the anaesthetic agents were seen on the above measurements at similar concentrations to those estimated in the CNS during clinical and veterinary anaesthesia. We suggest that the effects on fast oscillations associated with cognition may contribute to the mechanism by which these agents produce general anaesthesia.", 
    "107": "Pantoprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is a potent and well tolerated inhibitor of the gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase with a low potential to inhibit cytochrome P450. In this randomized, placebo-controlled two-period crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received placebo (reference) and 240 mg of pantoprazole (test) i.v. within 2 min once daily for 7 days each. On day 4 of either period, a 1 min bolus of diazepam (0.1 mg kg-1 body weight) was additionally injected. Pantoprazole was well tolerated and did not cause clinically relevant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and routine clinical laboratory parameters. There was no effect on diazepam clearance (0.021 1 h-1 kg-1 for test and reference) and elimination half-life (36.8 for test, 40.4 h for reference). Diazepam metabolism to desmethyldiazepam was not affected by pantoprazole. In conclusion, pantoprazole and diazepam may be administered concomitantly without dose adjustment even when high doses of pantoprazole are required.", 
    "108": "1. The metabolism of diazepam to its primary metabolites 3-hydroxydiazepam (3HDZ) and nordiazepam (NDZ) was evaluated in human liver microsomes. The 3HDZ pathway was the major route of metabolism representing 90% of total metabolism with a Vmax/Km ratio of 0.50-7.26 microliters min-1 mg-1 protein. 2. Inhibition of the two metabolic pathways of diazepam by omeprazole was investigated. The NDZ pathway was not affected by omeprazole whilst a Ki of 201 +/- 89 microM was obtained for the 3HDZ pathway (Km/Ki ratio of 3.0 +/- 0.9). 3. Inhibitory effects of omeprazole sulphone on the 3HDZ and NDZ pathways were also investigated. Omeprazole sulphone inhibited both pathways with similar Kis of 121 +/- 45 and 188 +/- 73 microM respectively (Km/Ki ratios of 5.2 +/- 2.3 and 3.3 +/- 1.5 respectively). 4. These in vitro data provide direct evidence for cytochrome P450 inhibition as the mechanism for the well documented diazepam-omeprazole clinical interaction and indicate that omeprazole sulphone, as well as the parent drug, contribute to the inhibition effect.", 
    "109": "1. The pharmacokinetics of diazepam were examined in seven young (20-30 years) and six elderly (60-75 years) males prior to and also after chronic oral dosing of diazepam. 2. Following intravenous administration, the half-life and volume of distribution of 14C-labelled diazepam in the elderly were approximately twofold greater than corresponding estimates in younger subjects (mean +/- s.d., 71.5 +/- 27.6 vs 44.5 +/- 16.5 h and 1.39 +/- 0.32 vs 0.88 +/- 0.30 1 kg-1, respectively). Clearance did not differ between the two groups (0.26 +/- 0.09 vs 0.29 +/- 0.09 ml min-1 kg-1). 3. The accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, were extensive during chronic administration. A radioreceptor assay that measured total benzodiazepine activity, including diazepam and its active metabolites, indicated that the accumulation of 'benzodiazepine equivalents' was similar to the sum of the accumulated diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentration levels. However, the level of 'benzodiazepine equivalents' on multiple-dosing was about double that of the predicted steady-state 'equivalent' concentration from single-dose studies. This was due to the insensitivity of the radioreceptor assay for desmethyldiazepam following single-dose diazepam administration. 4. There were no age- or dosing-related differences in diazepam clearance (0.37 +/- 0.22 vs 0.32 +/- 0.18 ml min-1 kg-1, young vs elderly, single-dose; 0.37 +/- 0.11 vs 0.27 +/- 0.12 ml min-1 kg-1, young vs elderly, multiple-dose) and no age-related differences in the levels of accumulated 'benzodiazepine equivalents' (243.7 +/- 60.1 vs 288.0 +/- 125.8 ng ml-1, young vs elderly). 5. Thus, changes that occur in diazepam disposition with ageing after acute administration do not appear to be important during chronic dosing. On the other hand, accumulation of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam are considerable and would be expected to be clinically relevant.",

    "111": "A method is presented for improving the precision of factor analysis by utilizing physiological information. The first step is an optimal linear dimension reduction, whereby the data are projected onto a low-dimensional signal space. Then principal component analysis is performed in the signal space rather than in the entire data space. This improves the precision of the principal components. Unlike ordinary principal component analysis, the present method is not degraded when the time intervals are subdivided, provided that the signal space is correct. Alternatively, but with identical results, the covariance matrix can be calculated from the whole data space. The covariance matrix is then transformed and principal component analysis is performed in either a low-rank matrix or a low-dimensional submatrix instead of in the whole covariance matrix. Factor analysis using the intersection method with a theory space may be improved by employing the present method. In simulations based on a [11C]flumazenil study with 27 frames, the proposed method required only 58 per cent of the radioactivity to produce the same precision as the intersection method and only 27 per cent when compared to ordinary principal component analysis.", 
    "112": "We have recently reported that the intracerebroventricular injection of the endogenous benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor ligand octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) (30 micrograms/kg b.w.) could induce a decrease in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) mRNA levels in the male rat brain. This inhibitory effect could be completely reversed by the concomitant administration of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin. In order to further investigate the mechanism of action of ODN, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of a smaller dose of ODN (3 micrograms/kg b.w.) and the influence of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and the antagonist to BZD receptors flumazenil on GnRH gene expression. Treatment with ODN induced a 40% decrease in mRNA levels, an effect which was potentiated by the concomitant administration of muscimol. The administration of flumazenil produced a small increase in GnRH mRNA while the inhibitory effect of ODN on GnRH mRNA levels was completely prevented by the administration of this BZD antagonist. Moreover, the intravenous administration of increasing doses of ODN also induced a marked decrease of 33, 32 and 38% for 75, 150 and 300 micrograms/kg b.w., an effect which was completely abolished by picrotoxin. These data clearly indicate that an endogenous neuropeptide can activate the GABAA BZD receptor complex to negatively modulate the activity of GnRH neurons. They also suggest that this peptide or other endogenous activators of the GABAA BZD receptors might exert a tonic inhibitory influence on GnRH gene expression.", 
    "113": "Glutamate antagonists have been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Global cerebral ischemia in rats leads to selective neuronal damage in the hippocampus and striatum. Following ischemia a deficit in spatial learning and memory occurs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of GYKI 52466, an antagonist at the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, with behavioural and histological measures of global ischemia in rats. Global ischemia was induced by four-vessel-occlusion (4VO) for 20 min in rats. GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg i.p.) was administered either 20 min before induction of ischemia or immediately after onset of reperfusion. One week after surgery spatial learning was tested in the Morris water maze. After behavioural testing the animals were sacrificed and the neuronal damaged was assessed. GYKI 52466 reduced the increase in escape latency and in swim distance induced by 4VO when given before ischemia but not when applied after ischemia. Neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus produced by 4VO was significantly attenuated by pretreatment but not by posttreatment with GYKI 52466. Striatal neuronal damage was not affected by either treatment with GYKI 52466. GYKI 52466 had neuroprotective effects in a rat model of global cerebral ischemia. Pretreatment with GYKI 52466 protected rats against behavioural deficits and hippocampal neuronal damage induced by 4VO.", 
    "114": "The diurnal variations in spontaneous and diazepam-induced anxiolysis and exploratory behavior were examined in Syrian hamsters in a plus-maze paradigm. The administration of diazepam or flunitrazepam augmented the percentage of time spent in the open arms, the percentage of entries to the open arms, and the number of crosses to both arms, whereas ethyl-beta-carboline injection decreased them. These three behavioral parameters showed significant daily variations, with the maxima being found at night (2400-0400 h). Flumazenil (5 mg/kg) injected at 0400 h decreased significantly the percentage of time spent in open arms and of entries to the open arms, without affecting significantly the total number of entries to both arms. Day-night differences in anxiety-related behavior persisted in hamsters kept under constant darkness for 3 days. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) increased the time spent in the open arms at 1600 and 2000 h only, and augmented the percent of entries to the open arms at 2000 h only. The total number of entries to both arms was augmented significantly by diazepam at all time intervals tested, except for 0400 h. The results indicate that Syrian hamsters exhibited significant diurnal changes in anxiolysis-related behavior in the plus-maze paradigm.", 
    "115": "Recent investigations in the authors' laboratory have shown that acute tone exposure (4 kHz continuous tone, 104 dB sound pressure level (SPL), 30-min duration) induces increases in the amplitude of click-evoked potentials in the inferior colliculus (IC). These increases have been attributed to a decrease in GABAA-mediated inhibition on IC neurons. In the present study, we examined the effects of three compounds (diazepam, clonazepam, and (-)-baclofen) that are known to enhance GABAergic inhibition on these tone exposure-induced increases and on changes in temporal integration in the IC. (-)-Baclofen was the only one of the three compounds tested that reversed in a dose-dependent manner the effects of tone exposure on both the amplitude of the click-evoked potentials recorded from the IC and on measures of the changes in temporal integration based on these potentials. Diazepam and clonazepam exhibited remarkably different effects on the click-evoked potentials recorded from the surface of the IC. Diazepam caused a dose-dependent decrease in one of the components of the IC potentials that reflects postsynaptic activity in the IC, whereas clonazepam caused a dose-dependent decrease in a peak that reflects input to the IC from the superior olivary complex (SOC). At dosages up to 40 mg/kg, neither diazepam nor clonazepam reversed the changes in temporal integration in the IC that were induced by the tone exposure; diazepam caused a small, but statistically significant, enhancement of the effects of tone exposure on this function. The results of this study show that (-)-baclofen is a potent modulator of both the excitability of neurons in the ascending auditory pathway and the processing of auditory information by IC neurons. The finding of the present study that two benzodiazepines (clonazepam and diazepam) have remarkably different effects on evoked potentials, which reflects both input to the IC and postsynaptic events in the IC neurons, suggests heterogenicity of the GABAA receptor from one structure to another in the ascending auditory pathway. We suggest that (-)-baclofen may be clinically useful in treating disorders of the auditory system that are caused by plasticity in the ascending auditory pathway.",

L-365,260 behaved as a surmountable antagonist and produced parallel rightward shifts of pentagastrin concentration-effect curves' in each of the replicate experiments. The experiments were performed by several different experimenters in the same laboratories over a five year period. 2. In the isolated, lumen-perfused, immature rat stomach assay, L-365,260 behaved as a simple competitive antagonist (Schild plot slope = 1.00 +/- 0.10, pKB = 7.54 +/- 0.03 from a global analysis of the data) acting at a homogeneous population of receptors in five separate, highly-reproducible, experiments. In contrast, the replicate data sets obtained from the interaction in the isolated, lumen-perfused mouse stomach and guinea-pig gastric muscle assays, over the same period, were not consistent with the presence of a single receptor population. The guinea-pig gastric muscle data were relatively reproducible between experiments but some individual Schild plot slopes and the slope estimated from a global analysis of all the data were significantly less than unity (slope = 0.80 +/- 0.07, pA2 = 8.56 +/- 0.05 from the global analysis). The data obtained in the mouse stomach were significantly more variable than that obtained in the same assay, during the same period, from the interaction between histamine and the H2-receptor antagonist, famotidine. The individual Schild plot slopes ranged from being very flat (0.20) to being not significantly different from unity (1.23) and the pA2 values ranged from 7.68 to 8.70. 3. Overall, the data could be accounted for by assuming the variable expression of two receptor subtypes across the assays. The rat stomach appeared to express a single receptor characterized by a low affinity constant for L-365,260 (pKB approximately 7.5). The guinea-pig gastric muscle and mouse stomach data could be explained by the presence of this receptor and a second one characterized by a high affinity constant for L-365,260 (pKB approximately 8.6). The activity of the two proposed receptor subtypes was consistent between experiments in the guinea-pig and the high affinity receptor appeared to be predominant. In contrast, the mouse stomach data could only be simulated by assuming that the proportion and absolute number of each subtype varied significantly between the replicate experiments. 4. The L-365,260 affinity estimates at the inferred receptor subtypes were indistinguishable from those obtained in a corresponding analysis of the behaviour of L-365,260 in CCKB/gastrin receptor radioligand binding experiments in guinea-pig gastric gland and mouse and rat cerebral cortex preparations.", 
    "117": "1. For several years, we have used the cholecystokinin (CCK)B/gastrin receptor selective antagonist, L-365,260, as a reference compound in a variety of studies in CCKB/gastrin receptor radioligand binding assays. Here, we have analysed the competition curve data sets obtained between L-365,260 and [125I]-BH-CCK8S in guinea-pig gastric gland and mouse and rat cerebral cortex preparations. 2. Competition curves obtained for L-365,260 in the mouse cortex assay were not different from rectangular hyperbolae (slope = 1.01 +/- 0.02) implying the presence of a single population of binding sites (pKI = 8.41 +/- 0.01; data from 47 experiments, slope constrained to unity). However, in the rat cortex and guinea-pig gastric gland assays, the mean slope of the competition curves was significantly less than one and the mean apparent pKI significantly lower than that obtained in the mouse cortex (slope = 0.85 +/- 0.03, 0.90 +/- 0.03; apparent pKI = 7.98 +/- 0.05, 8.07 +/- 0.05; 48 and 45 experiments, in rat and guinea-pig, respectively). The distribution of the individual pKI and slope estimates of the competition curves in these two assays was consistent with expectations for the variable expression (in terms of absolute number and proportion) of two binding sites. The two sites were characterized by pKI values for L-365,260 of 8.50 +/- 0.04 and 8.48 +/- 0.04 for the high affinity site and 7.32 +/- 0.04 and 7.22 +/- 0.06 for the low affinity site in guinea-pig and rat, respectively. 3. The affinity estimates for L-365,260, although obtained on different tissues, are consistent with data obtained from the analysis of L-365,260 antagonism of pentagastrin-stimulated responses in mouse and rat stomach (acid secretion) and guinea-pig gastric muscle (isotonic contraction) assays. To this extent, these data suggest the existence of two CCKB/gastrin receptor subtypes.",

Fentanyl, 7.5 micrograms/kg (group A), 12.5 micrograms/kg (group B), and 20.0 micrograms/kg (group C) plus midazolam, 0.075 mg/kg (group A), 0.125 mg/kg (group B), and 0.200 mg/kg (group C) were administered over 10 minutes; in group D, fentanyl, 7.5 micrograms/kg, and midazolam, 0.075 mg/kg, were administered within 1 minute.", 
    "123": "Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured using parameters in the time domain and the frequency domain. The comparison of preinduction HRV with the intra-anesthetic epochs did not show significant differences with respect to heart rate, coefficient of variation, and root mean squared successive differences. Spectral analysis showed significant reductions of power in the vasomotor band (0.01 to 0.05 Hz) and the low-frequency band (0.05 to 0.15 Hz) in all groups. Power in the high-frequency band (0.15 to 0.50 Hz) decreased slightly, but this did not reach the significance level. A dose dependency of these changes was found in the low-frequency band only.", 
    "124": "Parameters of HRV suggest that induction with fentanyl, midazolam, and pancuronium decreases sympathetic but not parasympathetic autonomic system activity. The anesthetic induction technique's modulation of autonomic nervous system balance is better represented by means of spectral analysis than by analysis in the time domain. This modulation was largely independent of the doses administered and independent of the speed of injection.", 
    "125": "In each of eight cycles of repeated reward reduction, the performance of rats given brief access to 32% sucrose for 3 days, and then 4% sucrose for 2 days, was compared to rats that received 4% on all 5 days. Shifted rats consumed less than unshifted rats following each shift, with little evidence of diminution of negative contrast across the eight shifts. Acute administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 8 mg/kg) on the second postshift day reduced contrast on each shift with no evidence of tolerance development to these anticontrast actions (Experiment 1a). Acute administration of CDP on the first postshift day had no effect on contrast through the first four shifts, but reliably reduced contrast on the following four shifts (Experiment 2a). There was tolerance to the sedative effects of CDP, as measured in an open field (Experiments 1b and 2b). The data thus show: a) that contrast is not lost with repeated shifts; b) no tolerance develops to the anticontrast actions of CDP and, instead, CDP gains anticontrast actions, in regard to initial contrast occurrence; c) but, concurrently, tolerance does develop to the sedative effects of CDP in an open field.", 
    "126": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) modulates learning and memory processes in mammals. The main objective of this work was to study the effect of two cholecystokinin receptor antagonists (CCKA antagonist devazepide and CCKB antagonist PD135158) on feed memory processes in Japanese quail. Memorization of colored food was measured by comparing the feeding behavior of 6- to 8-day-old quails during two successive sessions of 10 min after a 30-min fast in the test box, intersession interval: 24 h. The CCKA antagonist devazepide (0.1 mg/kg, b.wt) injected after the first session appears to disrupt feed memory formation. The CCKB antagonist PD135158 at the same dose induced a similar trend, but no significant effect on feed memorization could be measured. It is suggested that CCKA antagonist inhibits feed memory processes.", 
    "127": "Rat atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was investigated for putative anxiolytic activity in rats, following intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration. ANP in doses of 200 and 500 ng/rat induced significant anxiolysis, comparable with that of lorazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in a variety of anxiety models (open-field, elevated plus-maze, social interaction, and novelty-induced feeding suppression tests). Isatin, an endogenous anxiogenic indole, shown to be an antagonist of ANP in vitro, significantly inhibited the anxiolytic effect of ANP in the elevated plus-maze test in subanxiogenic doses. The anxiolytic action of ANP was unaffected by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Conversely, the anxiolytic action of lorazepam was antagonized by flumazenil but not by isatin. The data indicate that ANP may function as an endogenous anxiomodulator, which may act in conjunction with isatin independently of benzodiazepine receptors. These results strengthen the evidence for links between physiological systems involved in anxiety and those in natriuresis.", 
    "128": "The use of benzodiazepine medication is associated with a variety of acute and well-recognized withdrawal syndromes including anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and confusion. Catatonia has not previously been described. We report five patients who became catatonic after withdrawal of benzodiazepines. All five were older individuals (53-88 years) who had acutely become immobile, mute, and rigid with refusal or inability to eat or drink. Each of the five showed pronounced and rapid improvement after administration of low-dose lorazepam, which has previously been reported to be effective in the treatment of catatonia. Careful review of the records showed that each of the patients had been taking benzodiazepine medication for anywhere from 6 months to 15 years and that it had been rapidly tapered or abruptly discontinued 2 to 7 days before the onset of catatonia. These cases illustrate that severe and potentially life-threatening catatonia can develop in the wake of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Older individuals may be particularly vulnerable to this side effect.", 
    "129": "Polymorphs of (R)-1-[2,3-dihydro-1-(2'-methylphenacyl)-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepin-3-yl]-3-(3-methylphenyl)urea (YM022) were investigated. Two crystalline forms (alpha- and beta-forms) of YM022 were confirmed by powder X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry. alpha- And beta-forms were obtained by recrystallization from ethanol and ethanol: water (5:1), respectively. Amorphous YM022 was obtained by spray drying of YM022 methanol solution. Since both crystalline and amorphous YM022 were sparingly soluble in water, solubilization of YM022 by solid dispersion and wet grinding methods were performed. In vitro dissolution study and in vivo absorption study in dogs were carried out using spray-dried solid dispersion, heat-treated solid dispersion and mechanical mixture. Spray-dried solid dispersion and heat-treated solid dispersion showed enhanced bioavailability, whereas mechanical mixture showed no improvement.", 
    "130": "The ligand binding properties and esterase-like activity of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) expressed by Pichia pastoris were compared with those of plasma derived human albumin (pHSA). The binding of long fatty acid ions was determined by the equilibrium partition method using radiolabeled palmitate. The association constants and the number of binding sites of diazepam, salicylate and warfarin were determined by specific and nonspecific binding models. The high affinity binding of bilirubin was kinetically determined from the oxidation rate of free bililubin in the binding mixture. The binding parameters of these five ligands obtained with rHSA were within the same range observed with pHSA preparations. The kinetic parameters for hydrolytic activity of rHSA toward p-nitrophenyl acetate was also similar to pHSA. These results indicate that rHSA and pHSA have the same functional property."
