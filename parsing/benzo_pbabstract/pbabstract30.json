Despite this, 40\u201160% of patients suffering from HNSCC develop loco\u2011regional failure and/or distant metastases. Salinomycin has been demonstrated to be >100\u2011fold more effective than paclitaxel at causing cancer stem cell death, therefore, it may offer an important improvement in cancer therapy. However, the toxicity of salinomycin is of concern. A possible solution may be the administration of additive drugs, which reduce the toxicity. By inhibiting the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger using the benzodiazepine derivate, CGP37157 (CGP), a significant reduction in salinomycin neuronal toxicity has been observed. This raises the question of whether CGP also inhibits the tumor toxicity of salinomycin. In the present study, the FaDu and HLaC79 C1 HNSCC cell lines were treated with salinomycin with or without CGP. Comparative viability assessments were performed using microscopy, a fluorescein diacetate assay, an MTT assay, a clonogenic assay and annexin V\u2011propidium iodide staining. The expression levels of MDR\u20111 were monitored using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Salinomycin alone, and in combination with CGP, achieved a significant attenuation of cell viability and increased apoptosis in a dose\u2011dependent manner. However, the tumor toxicity of salinomycin was not inhibited by CGP. The HLaC79 C1 cells were more sensitive to salinomycin, compared with the FaDu cells, with this sensitivity being due to high expression levels of MDR\u20111 by the HLaC79 C1 cells. In conclusion, CGP did not counteract the tumor toxicity of salinomycin in vitro and may be a promising drug in future anticancer therapy. The results of the present study encourages further investigation of the toxicological aspects of salinomycin, particularly in human cells and animal models.",

    "19": "We report a case of a previously healthy 19-month-old girl who presented after an acute ingestion of an estimated 37 mg/kg vilazodone. She was taken to an outside emergency department approximately 1 h after an unwitnessed ingestion. Initially, the patient was noted to have decreased responsiveness, sluggish but reactive pupils, altered mental status, and reported seizure activity. She was given intravenous lorazepam for seizure control, intubated, and transferred to a pediatric tertiary care facility, where she continued to show signs of serotonin toxicity and received treatment with benzodiazepines and cyproheptadine. Despite vilazodone's long half-life and the large amount ingested, the patient was extubated within 10 h of presentation, had returned to baseline mental status by 22 h, and was discharged home approximately 57 h after ingestion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Accidental ingestions are common in the pediatric population. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of acute medication toxicities, the expected clinical course, and the necessary supportive measures used to treat these patients. Because vilazodone is a recently approved medication, there is little experience with acute vilazodone ingestions. This report considerably increases the understanding of vilazodone's effects in the setting of an acute ingestion.", 
    "20": "In this study, we investigated the anxiogenic-like effects of systemically administered veratrine in rat models of anxiety. In the light/dark test, veratrine (0.6 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly and dose-dependently decreased the time rats spent in and the number of entries into a light box 30 min after administration, suggesting that veratrine increases anxiety-like behaviors. These findings were also supported by results from the elevated-plus maze test and the tail-swing behavior test. In addition, veratrine (0.6 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly increased the plasma concentration of corticosterone, an endogenous biomarker for anxiety, compared to vehicle. On the basis of these results, we conclude that veratrine induces anxiogenic-like behaviors in rats. The anxiogenic-like behaviors induced by veratrine (0.6 mg/kg, s.c.) were completely abolished by co-treatment with the typical benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (1 mg/kg, s.c.), when assessed in the elevated-plus maze test. Similar results were obtained with co-treatment with riluzole (10 mg/kg, p.o.), which directly affects the glutamatergic system and has recently been suggested to have anxiolytic-like effects. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that systemically administered veratrine induces anxiogenic-like behaviors in rats. We propose the veratrine model as a novel pathological animal model to explore possible candidate drugs for anxiolytics.", 
    "21": "A hexanucleotide repeat expansion residing within the C9ORF72 gene represents the most common known cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and places the disease among a growing family of repeat expansion disorders. The presence of RNA foci, repeat-associated translation products, and sequestration of RNA binding proteins suggests that toxic RNA gain-of-function contributes to pathology while C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency may be an additional pathological factor. One viable therapeutic strategy for treating expansion diseases is the use of small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic modifier proteins to reactivate expanded genetic loci. Indeed, previous studies have established proof of this principle by increasing the drug-induced expression of expanded (and abnormally heterochromatinized) FMR1, FXN and C9ORF72 genes in respective patient cells. While epigenetic modifier proteins are increasingly recognized as druggable targets, there have been few screening strategies to address this avenue of drug discovery in the context of expansion diseases. Here we utilize a semi-high-throughput gene expression based screen to identify siRNAs and small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic modifier proteins that regulate C9ORF72 RNA in patient fibroblasts, lymphocytes and reprogrammed motor neurons. We found that several bromodomain small molecule inhibitors increase the expression of C9ORF72 mRNA and pre-mRNA without affecting repressive epigenetic signatures of expanded C9ORF72 alleles. These data suggest that bromodomain inhibition increases the expression of unexpanded C9ORF72 alleles and may therefore compensate for haploinsufficiency without increasing the production of toxic RNA and protein products, thereby conferring therapeutic value.",

Neither drug in combination with morphine provided ideal sedation, suggesting that in unparalysed patients a third background agent is necessary. The disappointing recruitment rates reflect a reluctance of parents to provide consent when established on a sedation regimen, and reluctance of clinicians to allow sedation to be studied in unstable critically ill children.

Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs8048076, rs1478697, rs10500331, and rs4786847) of the A2BP1 gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We analyzed putative association of A2BP1 polymorphisms with AIWG of olanzapine using linear regression analysis and found that SNP rs1478697 was significantly associated with AIWG caused by olanzapine (p=0.0012; Bonferroni corrected p=0.0048).

Clinical improvements include weight gain and reduced pathological hyperactivity. However the neuronal populations and mechanisms underlying OLZ actions are not known. We studied the effects of OLZ on hyperactivity using male mice lacking the hypothalamic neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCHKO) that are lean and hyperactive. We compared the in vivo effects of systemic or intra-accumbens nucleus (Acb) OLZ administration on locomotor activity in WT and MCHKO littermates. Acute systemic OLZ treatment in WT mice significantly reduced locomotor activity, an effect that is substantially attenuated in MCHKO mice. Furthermore, OLZ infusion directly into the Acb of WT mice reduced locomotor activity, but not in MCHKO mice. To identify contributing neuronal mechanisms, we assessed the effect of OLZ treatment on Acb synaptic transmission ex vivo and in vitro. Intraperitoneal OLZ treatment reduced Acb GABAergic activity in WT but not MCHKO neurons. This effect was also seen in vitro by applying OLZ to acute brain slices. OLZ reduced the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic activity that was more robust in WT than MCHKO Acb. These findings indicate that OLZ reduced Acb GABAergic transmission and that MCH is necessary for the hypolocomotor effects of OLZ.",

    "60": "Nurses and respiratory therapists were trained to follow the algorithm in one-hour educational sessions; fidelity to the algorithm was subsequently confirmed. Fourteen patients evenly distributed by ethnicity and gender were enrolled, eight in the control MICU and six in the intervention unit. No significant differences in age, consciousness, illness severity, or baseline RDOS were found. All control patients underwent a one-step terminal extubation process. There were no incidences of post-extubation stridor in the intervention group, whereas three (38%) control patients experienced stridor. Patients in the intervention group had greater respiratory comfort compared with control patients (p<0.05). Differences in medication use were found with lorazepam favored in the control unit; morphine is recommended in the algorithm.",

    "62": "The effects of anesthetics on the injured brain continue to be the subject of controversial discussion. Since isoflurane has recently been shown to induce apoptosis of cerebral endothelial cells, this study compared different anesthetic compounds regarding their potential to induce cerebro-vascular apoptosis.", 
    "63": "The in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier used in this study consisted of astrocyte-conditioned human umbilical vein endothelial cells (AC-HUVEC) has been used. After 24 h of deep hypoxia and reoxygenation or control treatment, AC-HUVEC were exposed to 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 times the minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane or sevoflurane, or 0, 75, 150, or 300 nM of midazolam for 2 h. After 24 h, AC-HUVEC were harvested, and the degree of apoptosis was assessed by means of Western blots for the Bax and Bcl-2 ratio and, for controls and the highest concentration groups, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL).", 
    "64": "Without hypoxic pretreatment, 2.0 MAC of isoflurane slightly increased TUNEL intensity compared to control and sevoflurane, but without any significant changes in the Bax and Bcl-2 ratio. After hypoxic pretreatment, exposure to isoflurane led to a multifold increase in the Bax and Bcl-2 ratio in a dose dependent manner, which was also significantly higher than the ratio observed in the 2 MAC sevoflurane group. TUNEL intensity in the post-hypoxic 2 MAC isoflurane group was increased by a factor of 11 vs. control and by 40 vs. sevoflurane. Sevoflurane and midazolam did not significantly alter these markers of apoptosis, when compared to the control group.", 
    "65": "Isoflurane administered after hypoxia elevates markers of apoptosis in endothelial cells transdifferentiated to the cerebro-vascular endothelium. Endothelial apoptosis may be a previously underestimated mechanism of anesthetic neurotoxicity. Administration of high concentrations of isoflurane in experimental settings may have negative effects on the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "66": "Clobazam is the newest medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients at least 2 years of age, although the medication has been available in countries around the world to treat epilepsy and anxiety disorders for many years. Though classified as a benzodiazepine, the drug differs structurally from other drugs in the class as it possesses nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 5 positions within the heterocyclic ring rather than at the 1 and 4 positions. This difference and the classification of clobazam as a partial agonist are believed to be responsible for the decreased incidence of sedative effects compared to other benzodiazepines. Adverse events associated with clobazam use in clinical trials have generally been mild to moderate in nature. Data from an open-label extension trial have confirmed that clobazam is efficacious for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS, particularly atonic seizures (drop seizures), over the long term. Tolerance to the drug's antiepileptic effects does not seem to be a common occurrence. The drug has proven to be a cost-effective option for therapy, particularly due to its ability to decrease the number of seizures that require medical treatment. Clobazam represents a welcome addition to the treatment options for LGS.",

In the valproate subgroup (n = 50), seizures could be controlled in 34 (68%) with lorazepam+valproate infusion. In the levetiracetam subgroup (n = 50), seizures could be controlled in 39 (78%) with lorazepam+levetiracetam infusion. There was no statistically significant difference between the subgroups (p = 0.44).

Fourteen patients had convulsive SE (CSE), 11 had nonconvulsive SE (NCSE), and 5 had epilepsia partialis continua (EPC). The patients were given IV LEV with dosages ranging between 1000 and 4000 mg/day. Twenty-nine of the patients continued to receive LEV orally as maintenance treatment. The most common etiologies were cerebrovascular diseases (n = 7) and brain tumors (n = 6). SE was terminated in 23 (76.6%) patients. In the 12 months that followed SE, 9 of our patients (30%) died and 4 patients could not be contacted. Fifteen patients reported having no adverse effects, whereas three had mild adverse effects. No major adverse effects or complications causing disability were observed in twelve patients who were unconscious.", 
    "74": "Treatment with IV LEV is well-tolerated and effective both in focal and generalized SE. IV LEV has the combined advantage of efficacy, safety, and ease of use, which qualifies it to be the first choice after benzodiazepines (BZD) in the treatment of SE. This is the first prospective study of IV LEV treatment in status epilepticus and has the longest follow-up period, one year.", 
    "75": "There is a high rate of benzodiazepine use in the population. Benzodiazepines are used for multiple indications (anxiety, seizures, alcohol withdrawal, muscular relaxation and anesthesia). Benzodiazepines are also addictive substances and a non-negligible fraction of regular users will develop dependence. There is currently no approved pharmacotherapy for benzodiazepine use disorder treatment and optimal strategies for treatment are unclear. In this review, we aimed to summarize the findings on off-label pharmacologic therapy that have been used for BZD dependence. One classical approach is to provide a slow taper associated with counseling. Anti-epileptic drugs appear also to alleviate symptoms of withdrawal. The long-term strategies of maintenance therapy (with benzodiazepine) or of blocking therapy (with a GABA antagonist such as flumazenil) could provide some clinical benefit but have not yet been tested appropriately. Pregabalin appears promising and deserves further investigation. There is a clear need for more clinical trials in this area to improve care.", 
    "76": "Although trazodone is approved and marketed in most countries worldwide for the sole treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, the use for this medication is very common for many other conditions, such as primary or secondary insomnia, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder. Other, not officially approved, uses of trazodone include: the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine and/or alcohol dependence or abuse, fibromyalgia, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as dementia and other organic disorders, schizophrenia, chronic pain, and diabetic neuropathy. In addition, due to its 5HT2A receptor antagonistic action, trazodone may be used to prevent the occurrence of initial and long-term side effects of SSRI, such as anxiety, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. Despite the favorable clinical experience and the encouraging results from the studies that have tested the efficacy of trazodone for some of its off-label indications, it is paramount that large, randomized and controlled clinical trials be conducted in the near future to evaluate which of the many off-label indications are supported by a strong scientific evidence.", 
    "77": "This review paper discusses the central role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in diverse physiological systems and functions and the therapeutic potential of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15- 1788) for a wide range of disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Our group and others have studied the potential of flumazenil as a treatment for benzodiazepine dependence. A small but growing body of research has indicated that flumazenil may also have clinical application in CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, idiopathic hypersomnia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite this body of research the therapeutic potential of flumazenil remains poorly understood and largely unrealized. The purpose of this paper is not to provide an exhaustive review of all possible therapeutic applications for flumazenil but rather to stimulate research interest, and discussion of the exciting therapeutic potential of this drug for a range of chronic debilitating conditions.",

Participants were randomised to prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg daily versus matching placebo and were continuously guided to gradually reduce their usual benzodiazepine dosage. The primary outcome was mean benzodiazepine daily dosage at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included pattern of benzodiazepine dosage over time, benzodiazepine cessation proportion, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.",

    "82": "Schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine, or other second-generation antipsychotics, frequently develop metabolic side-effects, such as glucose intolerance and increased adiposity. We previously observed that modeling these adverse effects in rodents also resulted in hippocampal shrinkage. Here, we investigated the impact of olanzapine treatment, and the beneficial influence of routine exercise, on the neurosecretion machinery of the hippocampus. Immunodensities and interactions of three soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (syntaxin-1, synaptosome-associated protein of 25kDa (SNAP-25) and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)), synaptotagmin and complexins-1/2 were quantified in the hippocampus of sedentary and exercising rats exposed over 9weeks to vehicle (n=28) or olanzapine (10mg/kg/day, n=28). In addition, brain sections from subgroups of sedentary animals (n=8) were co-immunolabeled with antibodies against vesicular GABA (VGAT) and glutamate (VGLUT1) transporters, along with syntaxin-1, and examined by confocal microscopy to detect selective olanzapine effects within inhibitory or excitatory terminals. Following olanzapine treatment, sedentary, but not exercising rats showed downregulated (33-50%) hippocampal densities of SNARE proteins and synaptotagmin, without altering complexin levels. Strikingly, these effects had no consequences on the amount of SNARE protein-protein interactions. Lower immunodensity of presynaptic proteins was associated with reduced CA1 volume and glucose intolerance. Syntaxin-1 depletion appeared more prominent in VGAT-positive terminals within the dentate gyrus, and in non-VGAT/VGLUT1-overlapping areas of CA3. The present findings suggest that chronic exposure to olanzapine may alter hippocampal connectivity, especially in inhibitory terminals within the dentate gyrus, and along the mossy fibers of CA3. Together with previous studies, we propose that exercise-based therapies might be beneficial for patients being treated with olanzapine.", 
    "83": "Safe sedation is fundamental to many modern cardiological procedures, and following the publication of the report on safe sedation by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, this report discusses sedation specifically in cardiological practice. The major areas within cardiology that use sedation are cardioversion, catheter ablation particularly of atrial fibrillation, transoesophageal echocardiography, implantable device (cardiovascular implantable electronic device) procedures and other procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement. There is increasing demand for cardiological sedation but there is wide geographical variation in its use and there are also growing data to support non-anaesthetists giving sedation. The use of benzodiazepines, particularly for short procedures, is common, but even here good record-keeping and audit together with an understanding of the continuum of sedation and having appropriately trained staff and the necessary facilities are vital. Nurse administration of propofol may be appropriate for some procedures in cardiology that require at least moderate sedation. Appropriate training is essential and the use of capnography and target controlled infusion pumps for propofol administration is recommended.",

The structures of the new compounds were established based on 1D and 2D NMR spectral analysis, and, in the case of sartorenol (1) and tryptoquivaline U (3), X-ray analysis was used to confirm their structures and to determine the absolute configuration of their stereogenic carbons. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and multidrug-resistant isolates from the environment; however, none exhibited antibacterial activity (MIC \u02c3 256 mg/mL).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of GABA inhibitory neurons in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dysregulation assessed with a dimensional measure. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 35 children with ADHD using 123I-iomazenil, which binds with high affinity to benzodiazepine receptors. Iomazenil binding activities were assessed with respect to the presence or absence of a threshold CBCL-DP (a score \u2265210 for the sum of the three subscales: Attention Problems, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression). We then attempted to identify which CBCL-DP subscale explained the most variance with respect to SPECT data, using \"age,\" \"sex,\" and \"history of maltreatment\" as covariates. Significantly higher iomazenil binding activity was seen in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of ADHD children with a significant CBCL-DP. The Anxiety/Depression subscale on the CBCL had significant effects on higher iomazenil binding activity in the left superior frontal, middle frontal, and temporal regions, as well as in the PCC. The present brain SPECT findings suggest that GABAergic inhibitory neurons may play an important role in the neurobiology of the CBCL-DP, in children with ADHD.",

The purpose of this prospective study was to test the effects of two different anesthetic protocols on cardiac measurements in 10 healthy beagle dogs using 64-multidetector row computed tomographic angiography (64-MDCTA), 3T magnetic resonance (MRI) and standard awake echocardiography. Both anesthetic protocols used propofol for induction and isoflourane for anesthetic maintenance. In addition, protocol A used midazolam/fentanyl and protocol B used dexmedetomedine as premedication and constant rate infusion during the procedure. Significant elevations in systolic and mean blood pressure were present when using protocol B. There was overall good agreement between the variables of cardiac size and systolic function generated from the MDCTA and MRI exams and no significant difference was found when comparing the variables acquired using either anesthetic protocol within each modality. Systolic function variables generated using 64-MDCTA and 3T MRI were only able to predict the left ventricular end diastolic volume as measured during awake echocardiogram when using protocol B and 64-MDCTA. For all other systolic function variables, prediction of awake echocardiographic results was not possible (P = 1). Planar variables acquired using MDCTA or MRI did not allow prediction of the corresponding measurements generated using echocardiography in the awake patients (P = 1).

AZD2327 and N-deethylated AZD2327 (M1) are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A4) and comprise a complex multiple inhibitory system that causes competitive and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. The aim of the current work was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict quantitatively the magnitude of CYP3A4 mediated drug-drug interaction with midazolam as the substrate. Integrating in silico, in vitro and in vivo PK data, a PBPK model was successfully developed to simulate the clinical accumulation of AZD2327 and its primary metabolite. The inhibition of CYP3A4 by AZD2327, using midazolam as a probe drug, was reasonably predicted. The predicted maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for midazolam were increased by 1.75 and 2.45-fold, respectively, after multiple dosing of AZD2327, indicating no or low risk for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDI). These results are in agreement with those obtained in a clinical trial with a 1.4 and 1.5-fold increase in Cmax and AUC of midazolam, respectively. In conclusion, this model simulated DDI with less than a two-fold error, indicating that complex clinical DDI associated with multiple mechanisms, pathways and inhibitors (parent and metabolite) can be predicted using a well-developed PBPK model.", 
    "99": "Human DNA ligase1 (hLig1) is the major replicative enzyme in proliferating mammalian cells that join Okazaki fragments of the lagging strand during DNA replication. Interruptions in the process of ligation cause DNA damage to accumulate, resulting in cytotoxicity and cell death. In the present study we demonstrate that pyrrolo[1,4] benzodiazepine (PBD) derivatives exhibit anticancer properties by targeting the nick sealing activity of hLig1 as opposed to the DNA interaction activity known for such compounds. Our in silico and in vitro assays demonstrate the binding of these molecules with amino acid residues present in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the hLig1 enzyme. Two of these hLig1 inhibitors S010-015 and S010-018 demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against DLD-1 (colon cancer) and HepG2 (hepatic cancer) cells in a dose dependant manner. The molecules also reduced cell viability and colony formation at concentrations of \u2a7d20\u03bcM in DLD-1 and HepG2 cells and induced apoptotic cell death. In yet another significant finding, the molecules reduced the migration of cancer cells in wound healing experiments, indicating their anti-metastatic property. In summary, we report the anticancer activity of PBD derivatives against DLD-1 and HepG2 cells and propose a new molecular target for their activity.", 
    "100": "Serotonin syndrome is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction resulting from the use or overuse of serotonergic medications alone or in combination. Mild symptoms, overlapping features with similar conditions and clinician lack of awareness are the major reasons for an often missed diagnosis. Not surprisingly, this condition is significantly underreported as a potential complication of endoscopy if serotonergic medications are used periprocedurally for sedation and analgesia. Here we report the case of a patient with relapsed chronic hepatitis C on antidepressant medications who developed signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Review of the patient's medication list suggested a possible interaction between her home antidepressants and the post-procedure use of fentanyl for abdominal pain. The patient required monitoring in the medical intensive care unit and stabilized after the administration of benzodiazepines and temporary discontinuation of her home medications. We propose that clinicians need to be aware of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome in the outpatient endoscopy setting, particularly with the wider use of serotonergic antidepressants now available and the repeated number of liver biopsies being performed for management of patients with chronic liver disease.",

As compared to other groups of psychotropic medication, antipsychotics, both typical and atypical, are less likely to cause adverse cutaneous reactions. The most frequent cutaneous adverse reactions associated with antipsychotics include fixed drug eruptions, exanthematous eruptions, photosensitivity reactions and altered skin pigmentation. Most of these commonly seen cutaneous adverse reactions are benign and easily treatable. Rarely, severe cutaneous adverse reactions such as erythema multiforme, Steven-Johnson syndrome are toxic epidermal necrolysis and have also been associated with antipsychotics. Olanzapine is one of the most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic with metabolic complications as most common adverse effects. Dermatological reactions are rarely observed with olanzapine. We report occurrence of pellagroid skin lesions over exposed areas of upper limbs with olanzapine that resolved completely after its discontinuation.",

To better understand urban opioid overdose deaths, this paper examines geographic, demographic, and clinical differences between heroin-related decedents and prescription opioid decedents in San Francisco from 2010 to 2012. During this time period, 331 individuals died from accidental overdose caused by opioids (310 involving prescription opioids and 31 involving heroin). Deaths most commonly involved methadone (45.9%), morphine (26.9%), and oxycodone (21.8%). Most deaths also involved other substances (74.9%), most commonly cocaine (35.3%), benzodiazepines (27.5%), antidepressants (22.7%), and alcohol (19.6%). Deaths were concentrated in a small, high-poverty, central area of San Francisco and disproportionately affected African-American individuals. Decedents in high-poverty areas were significantly more likely to die from methadone and cocaine, whereas individuals from more affluent areas were more likely die from oxycodone and benzodiazepines. Heroin decedents were more likely to be within a younger age demographic, die in public spaces, and have illicit substances rather than other prescription opioids. Overall, heroin overdose death, previously common in San Francisco, is now rare. Prescription opioid overdose has emerged as a significant concern, particularly among individuals in high-poverty areas. Deaths in poor and affluent regions involve different causative opioids and co-occurring substances.",

Over the last decade, however, multiple concerns have been raised on the risks related to the prescription of benzodiazepines, for their addictive potential and for cognitive side-effects. Therefore, benzodiazepines are today considered as a double-edge sword, which should be carefully handled and preferentially prescribed by specialists (or at least under their supervision), after an adequate training. Unfortunately, this is not the case in many situations, and the need to improve training on benzodiazepines management has been recently emphasized.", 
    "108": "No large-scale randomized trial has compared the effect of different second-generation antipsychotic drugs and any first-generation drug on alcohol, drug and nicotine use in patients with schizophrenia. The Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness study randomly assigned 1432 patients formally diagnosed with schizophrenia to four second-generation antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, risperidone quetiapine, and ziprasidone) and one first-generation antipsychotic (perphenazine) and followed them for up to 18 months. Secondary outcome data documented cigarettes smoked in the past week and alcohol and drug use severity ratings. At baseline, 61% of patients smoked, 35% used alcohol, and 23% used illicit drugs. Although there were significant effects of time showing reduction in substance use over the 18 months (all p < 0.0001), this study found no evidence that any antipsychotic was robustly superior to any other in a secondary analysis of data on substance use outcomes from a large 18-month randomized schizophrenia trial.",

Pharmacokinetics of human cytochrome P450 probes determined in cynomolgus monkeys after single oral or intravenous administrations were extrapolated to give human plasma concentrations. 2. Plasma concentrations of slowly eliminated caffeine and R-/S-warfarin and rapidly eliminated omeprazole and midazolam previously observed in cynomolgus monkeys were scaled to human oral biomonitoring equivalents using known species allometric scaling factors and in vitro metabolic clearance data with a simple physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Results of the simplified human PBPK models were consistent with reported experimental PK data in humans or with values simulated by a fully constructed population-based simulator (Simcyp). 3. Oral administrations of metoprolol and dextromethorphan (human P450 2D probes) in monkeys reportedly yielded plasma concentrations similar to their quantitative detection limits. Consequently, ratios of in vitro hepatic intrinsic clearances of metoprolol and dextromethorphan determined in monkeys and humans were used with simplified PBPK models to extrapolate intravenous PK in monkeys to oral PK in humans. 4. These results suggest that cynomolgus monkeys, despite their rapid clearance of some human P450 substrates, could be a suitable model for humans, especially when used in conjunction with simple PBPK models.", 
    "110": "The illicit recreational drug of abuse, \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a potent central nervous system depressant and is often encountered during forensic investigations of living and deceased persons. The sodium salt of GHB is registered as a therapeutic agent (Xyrem\u00ae), approved in some countries for the treatment of narcolepsy-associated cataplexy and (Alcover\u00ae) is an adjuvant medication for detoxification and withdrawal in alcoholics. Trace amounts of GHB are produced endogenously (0.5-1.0 mg/L) in various tissues, including the brain, where it functions as both a precursor and a metabolite of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Available information indicates that GHB serves as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the GABAergic system, especially via binding to the GABA-B receptor subtype. Although GHB is listed as a controlled substance in many countries abuse still continues, owing to the availability of precursor drugs, \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol (BD), which are not regulated. After ingestion both GBL and BD are rapidly converted into GHB (t\u00bd ~1 min). The Cmax occurs after 20-40 min and GHB is then eliminated from plasma with a half-life of 30-50 min. Only about 1-5% of the dose of GHB is recoverable in urine and the window of detection is relatively short (3-10 h). This calls for expeditious sampling when evidence of drug use and/or abuse is required in forensic casework. The recreational dose of GHB is not easy to estimate and a concentration in plasma of ~100 mg/L produces euphoria and disinhibition, whereas 500 mg/L might cause death from cardiorespiratory depression. Effective antidotes to reverse the sedative and intoxicating effects of GHB do not exist. The poisoned patients require supportive care, vital signs should be monitored and the airways kept clear in case of emesis. After prolonged regular use of GHB tolerance and dependence develop and abrupt cessation of drug use leads to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. There is no evidence-based protocol available to deal with GHB withdrawal, apart from administering benzodiazepines.", 
    "111": "Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disease, affecting about 1% of the world's population during their lifetime. Most people with epilepsy can attain a seizure-free life upon treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Unfortunately, seizures in up to 30% do not respond to treatment. It is estimated that 90% of people with epilepsy live in developing countries, and most of them receive no drug treatment for the disease. This treatment gap has motivated investigations into the effects of plants that have been used by traditional healers all over the world to treat seizures. Extracts of hundreds of plants have been shown to exhibit anticonvulsant activity in phenotypic screens performed in experimental animals. Some of those extracts appear to exhibit anticonvulsant efficacy similar to that of synthetic AEDs. Dozens of plant-derived chemical compounds have similarly been shown to act as anticonvulsants in various in vivo and in vitro assays. To a significant degree, anticonvulsant effects of plant extracts can be attributed to widely distributed flavonoids, (furano)coumarins, phenylpropanoids, and terpenoids. Flavonoids and coumarins have been shown to interact with the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor and various voltage-gated ion channels, which are targets of synthetic AEDs. Modulation of the activity of ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels provides an explanatory basis of the anticonvulsant effects of plant secondary metabolites. Many complex extracts and single plant-derived compounds exhibit antiinflammatory, neuroprotective, and cognition-enhancing activities that may be beneficial in the treatment of epilepsy. Thus, botanicals provide a base for target-oriented antiepileptic drug discovery and development. In the future, preclinical work should focus on the characterization of the effects of plant extracts and plant-derived compounds on well-defined targets rather than on phenotypic screening using in vivo animal models of acute seizures. At the same time, available data provide ample justification for clinical studies with selected standardized botanical extracts and plant-derived compounds.

To optimally benefit from the increasing numbers of genetically engineered mice, reliable high-throughput methods for comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice lines have become a necessity. Here, we describe the development and validation of an anxiety test, the light spot test, that allows for unsupervised, automated, high-throughput testing of mice in a home-cage system. This automated behavioral test circumvents bias introduced by pretest handling, and enables recording both baseline behavior and the behavioral test response over a prolonged period of time. We demonstrate that the light spot test induces a behavioral response in C57BL/6J mice. This behavior reverts to baseline when the aversive stimulus is switched off, and is blunted by treatment with the anxiolytic drug Diazepam, demonstrating predictive validity of the assay, and indicating that the observed behavioral response has a significant anxiety component. Also, we investigated the effectiveness of the light spot test as part of sequential testing for different behavioral aspects in the home-cage. Two learning tests, administered prior to the light spot test, affected the light spot test parameters. The light spot test is a novel, automated assay for anxiety-related high-throughput testing of mice in an automated home-cage environment, allowing for both comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice, and rapid screening of pharmacological compounds.", 
    "119": "The intramuscular (IM) and rectal routes are alternative routes of delivery for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) when the intravenous route is not practical or possible. For treatment of acute seizures, the AED used should have a short time to maximum concentration (Tmax). Some AEDs have preparations that may be given intramuscularly. These include the benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam) and others (fosphenytoin, levetiracetam). Although phenytoin and valproate have parenteral preparations, these should not be given intramuscularly. A recent study of prehospital treatment of status epilepticus evaluated a midazolam (MDZ) autoinjector delivering IM drug compared to IV lorazepam (LZP). Seizures were absent on arrival to the emergency department in 73.4% of the IM MDZ compared to a 63.4% response in LZP-treated subjects (p < 0.001 for superiority). Almost all AEDs have been evaluated for rectal administration as solutions, gels, and suppositories. In a placebo-controlled study, diazepam (DZP) was administered at home by caregivers in doses that ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg. Diazepam was superior to placebo in reduced seizure frequency in children (p < 0.001) and in adults (p = 0.02) and time to recurrent seizures after an initial treatment (p < 0.001). Thus, at this time, only MZD given intramuscularly and DZP given rectally appear to have the properties required for rapid enough absorption to be useful when intravenous routes are not possible. Some drugs cannot be administered rectally owing to factors such as poor absorption or poor solubility in aqueous solutions. The relative rectal bioavailability of gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin is so low that the current formulations are not considered to be suitable for administration by this route. When administered as a solution, diazepam is rapidly absorbed rectally, reaching the Tmax within 5-20 min in children. By contrast, rectal administration of lorazepam is relatively slow, with a Tmax of 1-2h. The dependence of gabapentin on an active transport system, and the much-reduced surface area of the rectum compared with the small intestine, may be responsible for its lack of absorption from the rectum.

This test allows the measurement of two defensive responses: inhibitory avoidance and escape, which in terms of pathology have been associated with generalized anxiety and panic disorders, respectively. For comparative reasons, the effects of exposure to the cat were also assessed in the elevated plus-maze. The results showed that a 5-min exposure to the cat selectively facilitated inhibitory avoidance acquisition, an anxiogenic effect, without affecting escape expression in the elevated T-maze. This was seen immediately but not 30 min after contact with the predator. This short-lived anxiogenic effect was also detected in the elevated plus-maze. Previous administration of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (2 mg/kg) decreased the immediate avoidance response to the predator and the neophobic reaction to a dummy cat used as a control stimulus. The drug also impaired inhibitory avoidance acquisition in the elevated T-maze, indicating an anxiolytic effect, without affecting escape performance.

We investigated the pathophysiological significance of astroglial GABA uptake in the regulation of Itonic in the PVN neurons projecting to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (PVN-RVLM). The Itonic of PVN-RVLM neurons were significantly reduced in heart failure (HF) compared with sham-operated (SHAM) rats. Reduced Itonic sensitivity to THIP argued for the decreased function of GABAAR \u03b4 subunits in HF, whereas similar Itonic sensitivity to benzodiazepines argued against the difference of \u03b32 subunit-containing GABAARs in SHAM and HF rats. HF Itonic attenuation was reversed by a nonselective GABA transporter (GAT) blocker (nipecotic acid, NPA) and a GAT-3 selective blocker, but not by a GAT-1 blocker, suggesting that astroglial GABA clearance increased in HF. Similar and minimal Itonic responses to bestrophin-1 blockade in SHAM and HF neurons further argued against a role for astroglial GABA release in HF Itonic attenuation. Finally, the NPA-induced inhibition of spontaneous firing was greater in HF than in SHAM PVN-RVLM neurons, whereas diazepam induced less inhibition of spontaneous firing in HF than in SHAM neurons. Overall, our results showed that combined with reduced GABAARs function, the enhanced astroglial GABA uptake-induced attenuation of Itonic in HF PVN-RVLM neurons explains the deficit in tonic GABAergic inhibition and increased sympathetic outflow from the PVN during heart failure.",

The present study aimed to characterize a new protocol using simple automated tracking software to evaluate general behavior and social interaction simultaneously. To this end, we used a single tank with a central transparent glass division and placed one zebrafish on each side for 5\u2009min. This strategy allows fish to interact visually at the same time that individual automated evaluation of behavior can be easily performed. Our results showed that, when two fish are placed side-by-side, there is an increase in their height in the tank compared with isolated fish and they remain close to each other. The pharmacological treatments with benzodiazepines (bromazepam and clonazepam) and the serotonergic drugs buspirone, fluoxetine, and escitalopram did not affect locomotion at the concentrations tested, except for the highest concentration of buspirone. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines increased interfish distance (i.e. reduced shoaling behavior) and serotonergic drugs elevated height in the tank. These results support the use of the side-by-side exploratory test for behavioral studies with the zebrafish, including high-throughput behavioral screening for antidepressants and anxiolytics.", 
    "164": "Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disease. Most patients have high-titer antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GADAb), which is without practical value in disease monitoring. Benzodiazepines are the first line drugs, but long-term use is not well characterized. This report demonstrates ineffective benzodiazepine therapy of SPS that prompts tachyphylaxis, loss of responsiveness, and finally benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Convulsion and anxiety correlate with high level of creatine phosphokinase (CK). Although tonus and spasm attacks were successfully controlled by tizanidine, glutamate release inhibitor, the immune response, and autoimmune diabetes development require the plasmapheresis, mycophenolat mofetil, and rituximab therapy that results in a significant decrease of GADAb, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CK normalization. Unfortunately, reintroduction of benzodiazepine was a source of rapid and high increase of CK, LDH, GADAb titer (up to 1:15,000), IGT, and SPS relapse. Contrary to previous publications, we observed IGT that correlated with high anti-GAD level, but without high immunogenetic susceptibility to haplotype human leukocyte antigens-DR3, DQw2. This preliminary observation and the last finding of immunomodulatory properties of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor suggest that increased antigenic stimulation during benzodiazepine therapy and glutamatergic hyperactivity could account for convulsions observed in SPS. Benzodiazepine withdrawal prompted alternative muscle relaxant therapy (tizanidine). Muscular and brain abnormalities observed in SPS indicate that noncardiac CK level may be a useful tool in SPS therapy monitoring.",

Failure to discontinue in the EMPOWER study was attributable to re-emerging symptoms among participants, prescribing inertia, and lack of knowledge and skills for substituting alternate therapy among physicians and pharmacists. To maximize de-prescription of inappropriate therapy, educational medication-risk reduction initiatives should be tested that simultaneously include patients, physicians and pharmacists. The objective of this trial is to: 1) test the beneficial effect of a new de-prescribing paradigm enlisting pharmacists to transfer knowledge to both patients and prescribers in a 2-pronged approach to reduce inappropriate prescriptions, compared to usual care and 2) evaluate the transferability of the EMPOWER study concept to other classes of inappropriate prescriptions.",

    "185": "Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent neuropsychiatric conditions, but their precise aetiology and underlying pathophysiological processes remain poorly understood. In light of putative anatomical and functional interactions of the relaxin-3/RXFP3 system with anxiety-related neural circuits, we assessed the ability of central administration of the RXFP3 agonist, RXFP3-A2, to alter anxiety-like behaviours in adult C57BL/6J mice. We assessed how RXFP3-A2 altered performance in tests measuring rodent anxiety-like behaviour (large open field (LOF), elevated plus maze (EPM), light/dark (L/D) box, social interaction). We examined effects of RXFP3-A2 on low 'basal' anxiety, and on elevated anxiety induced by the anxiogenic benzodiazepine, FG-7142; and explored endogenous relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling modulation by testing effects of an RXFP3 antagonist, R3(B1-22)R, on these behaviours. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of RXFP3-A2 (1 nmol, 15 min pre-test) did not alter anxiety-like behaviour under 'basal' conditions in the LOF, EPM or L/D box, but reduced elevated indices of FG-7142-induced (30 mg/kg, ip) anxiety-like behaviour in the L/D box and a single-chamber social interaction test. Furthermore, R3(B1-22)R (4 nmol, icv, 15 min pre-test) increased anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM (reflected by reduced entries into the open arms), but not consistently in the LOF, L/D box or social interaction tests, suggesting endogenous signaling only weakly participates in regulating 'basal' anxiety-like behaviour, in line with previous studies of relaxin-3 and RXFP3 gene knockout mice. Overall, these data suggest exogenous RXFP3 agonists can reduce elevated (FG-7142-induced) levels of anxiety in mice; data important for gauging how conserved such effects are, with a view to modelling human pathophysiology and the likely therapeutic potential of RXFP3-targeted drugs.",

    "187": "In the present study, we have elucidated the functional characteristics and mechanism of action of methaqualone (2-methyl-3-o-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, Quaalude), an infamous sedative-hypnotic and recreational drug from the 1960s-1970s. Methaqualone was demonstrated to be a positive allosteric modulator at human \u03b11,2,3,5\u03b22,3\u03b32S GABAA receptors (GABAARs) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, whereas it displayed highly diverse functionalities at the \u03b14,6\u03b21,2,3\u03b4 GABAAR subtypes, ranging from inactivity (\u03b14\u03b21\u03b4), through negative (\u03b16\u03b21\u03b4) or positive allosteric modulation (\u03b14\u03b22\u03b4, \u03b16\u03b22,3\u03b4), to superagonism (\u03b14\u03b23\u03b4). Methaqualone did not interact with the benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or neurosteroid binding sites in the GABAAR. Instead, the compound is proposed to act through the transmembrane \u03b2((+))/\u03b1((-)) subunit interface of the receptor, possibly targeting a site overlapping with that of the general anesthetic etomidate. The negligible activities displayed by methaqualone at numerous neurotransmitter receptors and transporters in an elaborate screening for additional putative central nervous system (CNS) targets suggest that it is a selective GABAAR modulator. The mode of action of methaqualone was further investigated in multichannel recordings from primary frontal cortex networks, where the overall activity changes induced by the compound at 1-100 \u03bcM concentrations were quite similar to those mediated by other CNS depressants. Finally, the free methaqualone concentrations in the mouse brain arising from doses producing significant in vivo effects in assays for locomotion and anticonvulsant activity correlated fairly well with its potencies as a modulator at the recombinant GABAARs. Hence, we propose that the multifaceted functional properties exhibited by methaqualone at GABAARs give rise to its effects as a therapeutic and recreational drug.",

However, it is unclear whether the same phenomenon can be detected in animal models of schizophrenia. The present study explored the generalizability of OLZ sensitization from healthy animals to a preclinical neuroinflammatory model of schizophrenia in the CAR. Maternal immune activation (MIA) was induced via polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) administration into pregnant dams. Behavioral assessments of offspring first identified decreased maternal separation-induced pup ultrasonic vocalizations and increased amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in animals prenatally exposed to PolyI:C. In addition, repeated adolescent OLZ administration confirmed the generalizability of the sensitization phenomenon. Using the CAR test, adolescent MIA animals displayed a similar increase in behavioral responsiveness after repeated OLZ exposure during both the repeated drug test days as well as a subsequent challenge test. Neurobiologically, few studies examining the relationship between hippocampal cell proliferation and survival and either antipsychotic exposure or MIA have incorporated concurrent behavioral changes. Thus, the current study also sought to reveal the correlation between OLZ behavioral sensitization in the CAR and hippocampal cell proliferation and survival. 5'-bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry identified a positive correlation between the magnitude of OLZ sensitization (i.e. change in avoidance suppression induced by OLZ across days) and hippocampal cell proliferation.

To address this issue we used in vitro patch-clamp recordings of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) from intact neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT) in brain slices from rat pups (postnatal age P10-P18) exposed at age of P7 to clinically relevant GA combinations of Iso and N2O.

Exposure to sub-anesthetic concentrations of 75 % N2O alone or 0.75 % Iso alone at P7 did not affect the amplitude of eIPSCs; however, Iso alone, but not N2O, significantly accelerated decay of eIPSCs. Anesthesia with 1.5 % Iso alone decreased amplitudes, caused faster decay and decreased the paired-pulse ratio of eIPSCs. We conclude that anesthesia at P7 with Iso alone or in combination with N2O causes plasticity of eIPSCs in nRT neurons by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. We hypothesize that changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the thalamus induced by GAs may contribute to altered neuronal excitability and consequently abnormal thalamocortical oscillations later in life.",

Although several studies have focused on the morphological fate of neurons dying acutely by GA-induced developmental neuroapoptosis, the effects of an early exposure to GA on the surviving synapses remain unclear. The aim of this study is to study whether exposure to GA disrupts the fine regulation of the dynamic spatial organization and trafficking of synaptic vesicles in presynaptic terminals. We exposed postnatal day 7 (PND7) rat pups to a clinically relevant anesthetic combination of midazolam, nitrous oxide, and isoflurane and performed a detailed ultrastructural analysis of the synaptic vesicle architecture at presynaptic terminals in the subiculum of rats at PND 12. In addition to a significant decrease in the density of presynaptic vesicles, we observed a reduction of docked vesicles, as well as a reduction of vesicles located within 100 nm from the active zone, in animals 5 days after an initial exposure to GA. We also found that the synaptic vesicles of animals exposed to GA are located more distally with respect to the plasma membrane than those of sham control animals and that the distance between presynaptic vesicles is increased in GA-exposed animals compared to sham controls. We report that exposure of immature rats to GA during critical stages of brain development causes significant disruption of the strategic topography of presynaptic vesicles within the nerve terminals of the subiculum.", 
    "213": "There is currently a gap in on-site drug of abuse monitoring. Current detection methods involve invasive sampling of blood and urine specimens, or collection of oral fluid, followed by qualitative screening tests using immunochromatographic cartridges. While remote laboratories then may provide confirmation and quantitative assessment of a presumptive positive, this instrumentation is expensive and decoupled from the initial sampling making the current drug-screening program inefficient and costly. The authors applied a noninvasive oral fluid sampling approach integrated with the in-development chip-based Programmable bio-nano-chip (p-BNC) platform for the detection of drugs of abuse.", 
    "214": "The p-BNC assay methodology was applied for the detection of tetrahydrocannabinol, morphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, methadone and benzodiazepines, initially using spiked buffered samples and, ultimately, using oral fluid specimen collected from consented volunteers.", 
    "215": "Rapid (\u223c10min), sensitive detection (\u223cng/mL) and quantitation of 12 drugs of abuse was demonstrated on the p-BNC platform. Furthermore, the system provided visibility to time-course of select drug and metabolite profiles in oral fluids; for the drug cocaine, three regions of slope were observed that, when combined with concentration measurements from this and prior impairment studies, information about cocaine-induced impairment may be revealed.", 
    "216": "This chip-based p-BNC detection modality has significant potential to be used in the future by law enforcement officers for roadside drug testing and to serve a variety of other settings, including outpatient and inpatient drug rehabilitation centers, emergency rooms, prisons, schools, and in the workplace.", 
    "217": "Detection of drugs in a child may be the first objective finding that can be reported in cases of suspected child abuse. Hair and urine toxicology testing, when performed as part of the initial clinical evaluation for suspected child abuse or maltreatment, may serve to facilitate the identification of at-risk children. Furthermore, significant environmental exposure to a drug (considered by law to constitute child abuse in some states) may be identified by toxicology testing of unwashed hair specimens. In order to determine the clinical utility of hair and urine toxicology testing in this population we performed a retrospective chart review on all children for whom hair toxicology testing was ordered at our academic medical center between January 2004 and April 2014. The medical records of 616 children aged 0-17.5 years were reviewed for injury history, previous medication and illicit drug use by caregiver(s), urine drug screen result (if performed), hair toxicology result, medication list, and outcome of any child abuse evaluation. Hair toxicology testing was positive for at least one compound in 106 cases (17.2%), with unexplained drugs in 82 cases (13.3%). Of these, there were 48 cases in which multiple compounds (including combination of parent drugs and/or metabolites within the same drug class) were identified in the sample of one patient. The compounds most frequently identified in the hair of our study population included cocaine, benzoylecgonine, native (unmetabolized) tetrahydrocannabinol, and methamphetamine. There were 68 instances in which a parent drug was identified in the hair without any of its potential metabolites, suggesting environmental exposure. Among the 82 cases in which hair toxicology testing was positive for unexplained drugs, a change in clinical outcome was noted in 71 cases (86.5%). Urine drug screens (UDS) were performed in 457 of the 616 reviewed cases. Of these, over 95% of positive UDS results could be explained by iatrogenic drug administration. There were no cases in which a urine drug screen alone altered the outcome of a case. In summary, hair toxicology testing proved clinically useful in the evaluation of a child for suspected abuse; in contrast, urine drug testing showed low clinical yield.", 
    "218": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is involved in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, which are processes disrupted in schizophrenia. Recent evidence from human genetic and animal studies suggests that the regulation of mGluR5, including its interaction with trafficking molecules, may be altered in the disorder. However there have been no investigations of hippocampal mGluR5 or mGluR5 trafficking molecules in the postmortem schizophrenia brain to confirm this. In the present study, we investigated whether protein expression of mGluR5, as well as Norbin and Tamalin (modulators of mGluR5 signalling and trafficking), might be altered in the schizophrenia brain, using postmortem samples from the hippocampal CA1 region of schizophrenia subjects and matched controls (n=20/group). Protein levels of mGluR5 (total: 42%, p<0.001; monomer: 25%, p=0.011; dimer: 52%, p<0.001) and mGluR5 trafficking molecules (Norbin: 47%, p<0.001; Tamalin: 34%, p=0.009) were significantly higher in schizophrenia subjects compared to controls. To determine any influence of antipsychotic drug treatment, all proteins were also correlated with lifetime chlorpromazine equivalents in patients, and separately measured in the hippocampus of rats exposed to haloperidol or olanzapine treatment. mGluR5 was negatively correlated with lifetime antipsychotic drug exposure in schizophrenia patients, suggesting antipsychotic drugs could reduce mGluR5 protein in schizophrenia subjects. In contrast, mGluR5 and mGluR5 trafficking molecules were not altered in the hippocampus of antipsychotic drug treated rats. This investigation provides strong support for the hypothesis that mGluR5 is involved in the pathology of schizophrenia, and that alterations to mGluR5 trafficking might contribute to the hippocampal-dependent cognitive dysfunctions associated with this disorder."
