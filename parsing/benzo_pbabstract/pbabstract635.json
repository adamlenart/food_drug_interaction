The drug was used 65 times. On 2/3 of all occasions the seizure was interrupted in less than 15 min. A starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg is recommended, with a maximum of 20 mg per single dose. One patient had respiratory difficulties, one dizziness and two skin reactions.", 
    "1": "Determination of serum concentrations of certain drugs is becoming increasingly important for optimal patient care. These drugs include many antibiotics, several antiarrhythmics, cardiac glycosides, lithium, phenytoin, some other anticonvulsants, salicylates, and theophylline. Serum level determinations can also be useful for establishing the best individual dosage of benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants. On the other hand, information about serum levels is not necessary or useful for many widely used drugs. In general, measurement of serum concentrations is valuable only for drugs whose dosage should be individualized and whose therapeutic and toxic actions are not adequately quantifiable by clinical endpoints. The serum concentration of the drug and of important active metabolites must be accurately measurable, the relation between their concentrations in the serum and the intensity of therapeutic and toxic effects during clinical use must have been clearly defined, and serum levels must always be knowledgeably interpreted in conjunction with careful clinical observation and judgment. Measurements of serum drug concentrations are most often useful during prophylactic drug therapy, in patients with major pharmacokinetic disturbances, and when patients show unusual and unexplained sensitivity or resistance to therapy with a drug.", 
    "2": "In seventy-five out-patients with gastric and duodenal ulcer a comparative double-blind trial with pirenzepin against placebo was performed. The dose was 50 mg pirenzepin daily or placebo respectively, the duration of treatment being 4 weeks. The healing effect of pirenzepin in duodenal ulcer patients could be proven endoscopically and was statistically significant when compared with placebo (p less than or equal to 0.05). Strong evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of pirenzepin could be further demonstrated in both duodenal and gastric ulcer patients by measuring the marked reduction of ulcer size, even though statistical difference against placebo in gastric ulcers was not fully achieved. Pirenzepin was well tolerated by all patients, except for a mild case of diarrhoea which occurred in one patient. No patient complained of dryness of the mouth or of blurred vision.", 
    "3": "This double blind trial oxprenolol/diazepam has been realised after open comparative trials performed with three other drugs and involving about one hundred ambulatory patients. Anxiety, mainly of somatic kind, seems to be the most regularly sensitive symptom. Results are in some cases better than those obtained with bensodiazepines, but without their side effects: drowsiness, alcohol's interaction, etc.. Symptomatic changes were evaluated using the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, and statistical analysis of scores was performed. In this study no psychotic patient was included. In previous trials of beta-blockers the author pointed out some positives changes in anxious psychotics.", 
    "4": "SEEG examination was conducted in 65 patients with temporal epilepsy during hexabarbitone-, diazepam- and sombrevin-induced sleep. It was found that hexabarbitone promotes manifestation of the dependent epileptic foci, while diazepam and sombrevin reveal the determinant epileptic foci and contribute to inhibition of dependent epileptic foci, mainly those localized in the cortex. The fusiform rhythm is mainly marked by cortical representation and is not recorded in the deep structures of the temporal lobes on the side of the determinant epileptic focus. The principal epileptic foci were localized in the limbic structures of the temporal lobes, which possibly determined their determinant role in epileptogenesis. In bilateral independent epileptic foci with a high level of spastic activity, focal epileptic discharges were preserved in the various methods of sleep activation. The possibility of topical diagnosis of the determinant and dependent epileptic foci provides for adequate tactics of surgical management of epilepsy.", 
    "5": "Sixty coronary patients undergoing aortocoronary bypassgrafts, some with left ventricular resection and some with associated valvular surgery were anesthetised with flunitrazepam, pancuronium and fentanyl according to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR). When 40 micrograms kg-1 fentanyl was amounted, a neuroleptic was added to the protocol either droperidol (D series, 30 cases), or chlorpromazine (L series, 30 cases), 0.005 mg kg-1 at random, if the SBP remained above 100 mm Hg or when the mean BP rose during the ECC at constant flow. Analgesia was maintained adding 0.05 mg fentanyl to each 2.5 mg neuroleptic dose. A stable cardiovascular state was achieved during the entire procedure in both series. Total doses were 53.25 +/- 10 mukg-1 (D) and 49.45 +/- 6.46 micrograms kg-1 (L) fentanyl, 0.5 +/- 0.25 microgram kg-1 droperidol and 0.38 +/0 0.032 mg kg-1 chlorpromazine. The large dispersion in the doses of neuroleptics was due to a few cases of resistance to their action during ECC. A low dose of neuroleptic (less than 0.4 mg kg-1) was sufficient in a statistically different number of patients in each series, 23 patients were given 0.25 +/- 0.1 mg kg-1 chlorpromazine and only 9 patients were given 0.23 +/- 0.11 mg kg-1 droperidol. This is thought to be due to the longer duration of action of chlorpromazine. All patients came off bypass easily. No low output state developed. During the postoperative period hypertension was not a problem when taking into account that hypertensive patients were not excluded. Thirteen patients in each series had a HR greater than or equal to 100 b.p. m. during more than 1 h, but longer after chlorpromazine (n.s.). There was no other difference in the course of the 2 series until discharge. These results prompt us to continue using droperidol because of its more satisfactory pharmacokinetic characteristics.", 
    "6": "The experiments on male white rats have shown that electroacupuncture of the point analog Da-Djuy abolished the consequences of pain-induced acute emotional stress. The stress-protective action of electroacupuncture was comparable with the effect of diazepam in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg and resulted in a significant reduction of the number of gastric erosions and in emotional reactivity, as well as in the increased aggressiveness as compared with the control group exposed to stress. The data obtained are discussed from the standpoint of electroacupuncture and diazepam action on the antinociceptive mechanisms of the brain.", 
    "7": "From 1964 to 1980 a total of 18 patients with tetanus were treated at Tampere Central Hospital, 5 (28%) of whom died. No assurance regarding earlier immunization could be obtained in 15 cases. In 13 cases the site of infection was a small scratch on the finger, the legs or the face. The mean incubation period was 8 days. Ten patients suffered from severe tetanus and 8 from moderate tetanus. Eight patients, of whom 2 died, were treated in an ordinary ward. After the surgical intensive care unit was set up, 10 patients received treatment there. Three died. The mean duration of hospitalization was 27 days and the mean treatment period in the intensive care unit 24 days. Seven patients were asymptomatic when discharged and 6 had minor after-effects. Cardiovascular complications can be prevented by intensive care, but pulmonary embolism remains the commonest cause of death. Special attention should be paid to its prevention.", 
    "8": "Intravenous diazepam was evaluated as a preoperative medication prior to periodontal surgery. Ten patients were subjected to two separately scheduled surgical episodes. During one procedure, a placebo was administered via an intravenous drip and during the other procedure, diazepam was titrated until Verrill's sign was reached. Vital signs, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and serum cortisol were monitored and analyzed during both procedures. Vital functions were more stable in diazepam-sedated patients than in the placebo group. This was manifested by less increase in systolic blood pressure, respiration and heart rate. The galvanic skin resistance was increased and serum cortisol values decreased throughout the sedation phase, suggesting a reduced sympathetic arousal. This study indicates that intravenous diazepam sedation enhances patient comfort and improves physiologic safety during periodontal surgery.", 
    "9": "Pirenzepine, (5,11-dihydro-11-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-acetyl]-6H-pyrido-[2,3] [1,4]-benzodiazepin-6-one dihydrochloride), tested on rats and mice, did not demonstrate any conspicuous behavioral action: it did not counteract reserpine hypothermia in mice, the L-DOPA hypermotility of mice, and (with the exception of very large doses) the amphetamine hypermotility in mice and rats. The drug neither prolonged the time of immobility of rats in the behavioral despair test, nor affected the central serotonin system in rats in tests for 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitches, tryptamine-induced convulsions and fenfluramine-induced hyperthermia at high ambient temperature. Pirenzepine did not affect either the hind limb flexor reflex in the spinal rat, nor the action of serotoninomimetics of it. The investigated compound had strong peripheral cholinolytic action as it inhibited salivation and lacrimation in the oxotremorine test. The oxotremorine tremor was weakened only by very high doses of pirenzepine. LD50 of the drug in mice was 412 mg/kg ip.", 
    "10": "Ten patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to investigate the effect of pirenzepine on nocturnal gastric acid secretion. Pirenzepine, 50 mg orally at bedtime, inhibited acid secretion all night long: the overall volume secreted and acid output (midnight to 7 a.m.) were significantly less than after placebo. The decrease in acid output per hour was significant at 1,2,3,6, and 7 a.m. It was concluded that controlled clinical trials of maintenance therapy for prevention of relapse of healed duodenal ulcers should be carried out with pirenzepine taken at bedtime.", 
    "11": "The effects of pirenzepine on the serum gastrin levels in the basal state and in response to a liquid test meal were investigated in nine patients with gastric ulcer. Single-dose administration of the drug caused a significant decrease in the basal gastrin level and significant inhibition of the serum gastrin response. When measured 12 h after the end of drug treatment for 7 days, the serum gastrin levels in the basal state and in response to a test meal tended to be high, but the differences were not statistically significant.", 
    "12": "Absorption, distribution and excretion of 14C-labelled 5,11-dihydro-11-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) acetyl]-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepin-6-one-dihydrochloride (pirenzepine, LS-519 Cl2) were studied in SD-JCL rats. After a single i.v. injection of the drug (2 mg/kg), the concentration of radioactivity in the blood decreased bi-phasically with half-lives of 1 and 8 h. After s.c. administration of the same dose, the drug was very rapidly absorbed and it was shown that the concentrations and the elimination pattern were almost identical to that observed following i.v. injection. After oral administration of 20 mg/kg, absorption was relatively slow, taking 3 h to reach Cmax. The concentrations of radioactivity distributed in most tissues reached their maximum 3 h after a single oral administration, well comparable with that in the blood. In the study with multiple administration (5mg/kg once a day up to 14 days), 24 h after withdrawal of 7-day administration, the concentration in the liver, kidneys and testes were two times those at a 1-day administration. This ratio, however, did not increase furthermore over a 10- to 14- day administration period. All tissue levels gradually decreased with time after the final administration. Thus, no specific or considerable accumulation was demonstrated. The drug found excreted into urine was about 46% and into feces about 53% of the administered dose 96 h after i.v. injection. After single oral administration, urinary excretion was found extremely low, i.e., 8%, while 91% was excreted via feces.", 
    "13": "Pirenzepine (Gastrozepin) is a drug recently introduced in the therapy of gastroduodenal ulcer (GDU). Although its effect of decreasing acid secretion is clinically known, its mechanism of action remains uncertain. The authors present investigations proving by in vitro experiments carried out on pure carbonic anhydrase (CA) and on CA from human gastric mucosa that GZ is a strong inhibitor of CA. In this acceptation, GZ may be considered both an enzymatic inhibitor and an antagonist of histamine H2 receptors.", 
    "14": "The pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous dose of diazepam 0.1 mg/kg was studied in 6 healthy volunteers, in random order under controlled conditions and following pretreatment with its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (20 mg/kg/day) for one week. In the two subjects with the highest plasma concentration of desmethyldiazepam (990 and 1100 ng/ml, respectively), total plasma clearance (Cl) of diazepam was reduced after desmethyldiazepam, by 31% and 54%, respectively. In three individuals there was a moderate decrease of 14% to 21%, and no effect was seen in one volunteer. Cl was significantly reduced (11.5 +/- 1.8 vs. 9.1 +/- 3.3 ml/min; p = 0.015) and elimination half-life tended to be prolonged (38.5 +/- 10.4 vs. 65.8 +/- 67.1 h; p = 0.15). It is concluded that high concentrations of desmethyldiazepam can influence the elimination of its parent drug diazepam by product inhibition.", 
    "15": "The binding of diazepam (DZ) and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) to plasma protein was evaluated in a series of controlled in vitro studies using equilibrium dialysis. Free fraction (FF) of both drugs alone changed significantly with total plasma drug concentration, but the increased FF (reduction in binding) did not occur until concentrations considerably exceeded those encountered during typical therapeutic use. Increasing concentrations of one drug at a time tended to increase FF for the other, although the effects were, at most, of borderline significance. Simultaneously increasing concentrations of both drugs led to significantly increased FF for both. Thus, DZ and DMDZ appear to bind to the same site or sites on plasma albumin. Binding is concentration-independent within and considerably above the usual therapeutic range.", 
    "16": "Occlusion pressure at 0.1 s (P0.1) and its evolution during progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia (CO2 chemosensitivity) were measured in 40 patients. Most of them (26) were affected by asthma and /or chronic bronchitis and had mild obstruction and hypoxemia. Measurements were made after 2 days of oral prazepam, diazepam or a placebo (single-blind study). Diazepam induced a significant decrease in P0.1 without affecting CO2 chemosensitivity. In contrast, prazepam did not significantly modify P0.1 or CO2 chemosensitivity. However, P0.1 decreased in 5/18 individual cases. 1 week of treatment by prazepam has advantages over diazepam by not depressing respiratory center output.", 
    "17": "A 7 year-old boy had had partial complex seizures from the age 6 years. Two days after commencing a treatment by VPA in a daily dose of 55 mg/kg body weight, disturbances of consciousness became obvious. He was admitted to hospital two days later. The E.E.G. on admission showed bilateral delta activity. The plasma levels of VPA was 140 mg/l. Diazepam, 7 mg, was given intravenously. Four minutes later, the clinical state and the E.E.G. returned to normal. This observation supports the hypothesis that VPA may have a paradoxical epileptogenic effect in some types of epilepsy.", 
    "18": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) given acutely has been found to have dose-related effects in rats given food preference tests. Low doses selectively increase consumption of familiar food, while high doses increase novel food consumption. The present study examined the effects of three doses of CDP given chronically. All doses (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) selectively increased novel food eating. There was some evidence for a selective retardation of eating rate for familiar food and an enhanced taste preference for sweet food in CDP-treated rats. However, the overall results suggest that increased consumption of novel food represents an antineophobic action of CDP, which is potentiated by chronic treatment over a low to medium dose range.", 
    "19": "It has previously been shown that chronic treatment with the GABA-transaminase inhibitor ethanolamine-O-sulphate (EOS), which elevates brain GABA levels by around 200%, selectivity enhances novel food consumption in rats treated with chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and given a food preference test. To replicate and extend these findings, the effects of two doses of CDP with and without EOS pretreatment were compared with those of EOS or saline alone. EOS alone had no significant effects except to decrease eating rate but, in combination with 2.5 mg/kg CDP, it antagonised the increase in weight of familiar food eaten found with CDP alone and marginally increased weight eaten and duration of novel foot eating episodes. EOS magnified the effects of 5.0 mg/kg CDP to increase markedly the weight eaten and duration of episodes for novel chocolate drops. As no additive effects of EOS and CDP on rate of eating were found, the results are consistent with a facilitation of novel food consumption by an anxiolytic action of the two drugs, rather than by a rate-retarding action which might bias animals toward novel food. Finally, that EOS alone did not mimic the effects of CDP suggests that the role of GABA in the anxiolytic action of CDP may be indirect.", 
    "20": "A number of clinically used benzodiazepines were tested for their effectiveness in blocking muscimol-induced myoclonic jerks in mice. Their ED50 values were determined from their dose-response curves. These data gave the following relative potencies with respect to diazepam: diazepam = 1, medazepam = 0.24, oxazepam = 1.27, flurazepam = 1.90, lorazepam = 3.01, nitrazepam = 3.93, clonazepam = 33.14, and flunitrazepam = 116.00. Because our earlier studies indicated that muscimol-induced myoclonic jerks probably originate from the spinal cord, the present method may prove to be suitable for quantitatively evaluating the effect of benzodiazepines on the spinal cord. The present results also indicate the possible value of flunitrazepam in the management of neurologic disorders in which preferential action on the spinal cord is desired.", 
    "21": "One group of eight normal young males was administered three doses of alprazolam (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg) and placebo, while a second group of eight normal young males was given three doses of diazepam (2, 5, and 10 mg) and placebo in the same design. All subjects slept in the sleep laboratory for 10 nights, 2 consecutive nights each week for 5 consecutive weeks. The first 2 nights served as adaptation. During the next 4 weeks subjects received a random dose of alprazolam (or placebo) or a random dose of diazepam (or placebo) each week. Similar dose-related benzodiazepine effects were found on sleep with both medications. Alprazolam reduced percent stage 4 and REM sleep and increased stage 2 sleep and latency to REM. Diazepam decreased percent stage 1 and increased percent stage 2 sleep. No drug by dose interactions were found. It was concluded that, while both drugs had similar effects on sleep, alprazolam showed significant effects on REM sleep parameters and might be evaluated for possible antidepressant effect.", 
    "22": "Two groups of rats were trained in a CER paradigm. The conditioned stimulus was a sound, the unconditioned stimulus was an electric shock. Group 1 received conventional CER training before the effects of different doses of diazepam were studied. For Group 2 the shock was always and exclusively given contingent on pretreatment with diazepam. After prolonged training the compound thus became a discriminative stimulus complex (DSC) and produced response suppression during the CS. Group 2 was also challenged with various doses of diazepam. The results showed that diazepam acquired diametrically different properties in the two groups. Group 1 exhibited disinhibitory effects and Group 2 suppressive effects, which may reflect anxiolytic and anxiogenic properties, respectively.", 
    "23": "After severe head injury the majority of deaths, during the early period, is due to acute intracranial hypertension. We report a series of 57 severe head injuries with early signs of brainstem involvement. CT Scan performed within 6 hours after injury and repeated at 48 hours showed hemispheric lesions and edema, without shift of the middle line. Treatment consisted of controlled ventilation, water and sodium restriction and barbiturates. A ventricular catheter was inserted in 52 patients allowing intracranial pressure (I.C.P.) monitoring, and permanent subtraction of cerebrospinal fluid (C.S.F.). This treatment allowed the control of a normal I.C.P. in 80% of the patients. In 6 patients a secondary surgical treatment was performed. In this series the mortality rate was 31,5% the good results and moderate disability 54,3%, the severe disability and vegetatives states 14,2%.", 
    "24": "A double-blind, randomized protocol was used to investigate the activity of a benzodiazepine derivative, chlordesmethyldiazepam, at two different dosages, 1 mg and 2 mg (CDDZ1 and CDDZ2), on mnestic functions and information processing in normal subjects. CDDZ2 significantly impaired short-term shortage of logical and associative memory, without activity on spatial and visual memory, whereas CDDZ1 showed no difference from the placebo. Neither CDDZ1 nor CDDZ2 impaired the level of vigilance and the information processes the morning after use of the drug.", 
    "25": "A reanalysis of 4-week data from a recently published study (Feighner et al. 1979) clearly demonstrate that in a significant subgroup of highly depressed patients who also suffer from at least moderate anxiety, significant treatment differences in favor of Limbitrol over AT were present not only after 1 or 2 weeks, but also after 4 weeks of treatment. These differences were not present in the less sick patients, a population in which AT was slightly favored. These findings suggest that not only is Limbitrol more effective than AT alone for a heterogeneous group of depressed patients with some concomitant anxiety during the early phases of treatment, but remains more effective that AT for a significant subgroup of highly depressed patients after 4 weeks of treatment.", 
    "26": "Kainic acid (KA), a heterocyclic structural analog of the putative excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate (Glu), powerfully mimics many of the neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic properties of Glu. KA differs from Glu and its straight chain \"excitotoxic\" analogs, however, in inducing a limbic seizure-brain damage syndrome when administered subcutaneously (12 mg/kg) to adult rats. This syndrome consists of sustained seizures, resembling amygdaloid kindled seizures, and acute destruction of neural elements in limbic brain regions (amygdala, olfactory cortex, hippocampus, lateral septum and several thalamic nuclei). Early changes consist of massive edematous swelling of glia and neuronal dendrites and either swelling or dark cell changes in neuronal somata, with subsequent necrosis of many of the neurons involved. Elsewhere we demonstrated that pretreatment with morphine markedly enhances both the convulsant and brain damaging actions of KA. Here we report that pretreatment with 2 anticonvulsants (diazepam or phenobarbital) markedly reduces both athe seizure and brain damaging actions of KA, whereas, two other anticonvulsants (phenytoin or valproic acid) fail to suppress either phenomenon. Our findings suggest that a seizure mechanism underlies much of the limbic brain damage induced by systemic KA and that the toxic mechanism may have two mutually reinforcing components--a glutamergic excitatory component and a GABAergic disinhibitory component.", 
    "27": "The pathways by which pinazepam and diazepam are metabolized by rat microsomes in vitro were studied in detail. Using a gas chromatographic technique to measure either the two parent compounds or their metabolites, it was demonstrated that pinazepam and diazepam were metabolized through the same pathways, but at different rates. Pinazepam was mainly N-dealkylated, while the C3-hydroxylation was a minor metabolic pathway. Diazepam was mostly C3-hydroxylated, with very little being N-demethylated. The different rats for the two metabolic pathways could be of importance in differentiating the action of the two drugs in vivo.", 
    "28": "Rats sustained electrolytic lesions either in the medial septal (MS) or lateral septal (LS) area or they were sham-operated. They were tested in the straight alley with food reward on either continuous (CRF) or partial (PRF) reinforcement at one trial a day and were injected with either 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide HCl (CDP) or with saline before the daily trial throughout the acquisition and extinction. The effects of the drug on resistance to extinction interacted with those of the LS lesion in ways which were consistent with the hypothesis that CDP acts via the lateral septal area if it is injected during acquisition on a PRF schedule. MS lesions produced only small changes in the effects of CDP. In general, CDP acted to reverse the effects produced by each lesion: Under those conditions in which MS lesions produced faster running speeds, CDP caused the lesioned animals to run slower; and under those conditions in which LS lesions produced slower running speeds, CDP caused the lesioned animals to run faster.", 
    "29": "Changes in smooth pursuit eye tracking of horizontal sinusoidal target movement before and after up to 10 mg oral diazepam were measured electrooculographically in diazepam-naive humans. Diazepam produced a dose-dependent reduction in gain of pursuit eye movements at target frequencies of 0.4--1.6 Hz. Cross-correlation of eye and track was significantly reduced at most frequencies showing gain reduction after 10 mg diazepam. Eye-target phase relationship was not systematically altered by drug. Visual inspection of smooth pursuit tracking records showed reduced peak-to-peak amplitude of eye tracking along with replacement of smooth pursuit with saccadic pursuit, especially after 10 mg. Changes in smooth pursuit eye tracking after diazepam were similar to those changes reported in the literature associated with olivopontocerebellar atrophy and were quite unlike the changes in smooth pursuit after opiates, as previously reported. The role of cerebellar benzodiazepine binding sites in diazepam disruption of eye tracking was discussed.", 
    "30": "Changes in saccadic eye movements before and after up to 10 mg oral diazepam were measured electrooculographically in diazepam-naive humans. Diazepam produced dose-dependent increases in saccade duration and decreases in maximum saccade velocity over a 2--36 degrees range of saccade amplitudes. The magnitude of drug-induced changes in saccade performance was proportional to the size of saccadic movement after 10 mg diazepam. Accuracy of saccade, latency to onset of saccade, latency to time of maximum velocity of saccade, and interval between the end of the initial saccade and the start of any corrective saccade were unaffected by the drug. Diazepam-induced changes in saccades were compared to saccades seen in patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy reported in the literature, and were contrasted with saccade changes caused by opiates as reported previously. The possible participation of cerebellum in changes in saccadic function after diazepam was discussed.", 
    "31": "Plasma concentrations and their relation to clinical outcome were evaluated in 21 patients who reached emergency treatment facilities following acute overdosage with benzodiazepine derivatives. Diazepam was implicated in 18 of the 21 cases, with plasma diazepam levels ranging from 585-8,635 ng/ml. In four cases of overdosage with diazepam alone, patients were minimally sedated and were discharged within 24 h, despite diazepam doses as high as 750 mg and plasma levels as high as 4,792 ng/ml. However, concurrent ingestion of diazepam together with other central depressant drugs (such as ethanol, barbiturates, analgesics, or tricyclic antidepressants) produced serious intoxication in 5 of the remaining 14 patients, regardless of the diazepam dosage or plasma concentration. Thus the severity of poisoning following benzodiazepine overdosage is determined largely by co-ingestion of other central depressants rather than the amount of benzodiazepine ingested or its concentration in plasma.", 
    "32": "The primary aim of this study was to compare task performance in a laboratory test and real driving performance of outpatients receiving diazepam medication with those of control subjects. Plasma and saliva samples were taken to investigate a level-response relationship. Real driving performance was measured by trained observers. The design of the laboratory test was based on a vigilance task (high attention) directly followed by a simple eye-hand coordination tasks (low attention). Twenty-two males participated in the study. Diazepam was given orally by prescription, mostly as a maintenance dose of 5 mg three times a day. Patients receiving diazepam showed impaired performance in the driving test and the low-attention task. Furthermore, the results indicate no relationship between plasma or saliva levels of diazepam and/or its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam and real driving performance and/or laboratory task performance.", 
    "33": "Two consecutive nights of flurazepam at each of 15, 26, and 45 mg were compared to placebo in a Latin-square double-blind crossover design using 24 healthy young-adult males. Flurazepam had significant hypnotic effects on objective and subjective measures of efficacy: shorter sleep latency, longer sleep time, and fewer awakenings. It also induced morning sedation along with decrements in cognitive performance. Flurazepam had dose-related impacts on both human and computer-scored EEG-EOG parameters: less stages 3 + 4 and decreased EEG delta, less stage 1 REM and decreased REM density, more stage 2 and increased EEG spindling. Also, EEG alpha and movement artifact were decreased and EEG beta was increased. Only a few of the EEG-EOG variables and none of the subjective indices had cumulative changes on the two drug nights. Stage shifting was unaffected at the two lower doses on the first night but decreased at all three dose levels on the second night; percent stages 3 + 4 was unaffected on the first night but decreased at all dose levels on the second night. The rate of delta waveform activity was also diminished by a greater amount on the second night. This study conclusively established that flurazepam affects the EEG-EOG architecture of sleep on each of the first two nights of administration.", 
    "34": "The effects of diazepam (10 mg orally) on the responding of normal human volunteers was studied in a procedure that involved the maintenance of operant behavior by monetary reinforcement and its suppression by monetary loss (punishment). Diazepam produced an antipunishment effect as shown by an increase in behavior suppressed by monetary loss. An analogy to animal procedures that selectively detect antianxiety drugs is apparent.", 
    "35": "Chloro-N-desmethyldiazepam (CDD) significantly reduced plasma tryptophan (TRY) and increased brain TRY in mice and rats. Quipazine did not change TRY levels in mouse plasma and brain but it respectively reduced and increased these two parameters in rats, to almost the same extent as CDD. Metergoline, an antagonist of serotonergic receptors, decreased blood TRY in both mice and rats but failed to change brain TRY. CDD significantly but slightly increased brain serotonin in rats. This effect was blocked by metergoline.", 
    "36": "Two experiments are reported, in which rats were run in a straight alley for food reward with or without injections of the anti-anxiety drug, chlordiazepoxide (CDP). The experiments were directed to two questions. (1) Can one predict the effects of CDP from knowledge of the effects of a second anti-anxiety drug, sodium amylobarbitone (SA) (2) can the effects of CDP be predicted from the hypothesis that anti-anxiety drugs attenuate responses to conditioned frustrative stimuli? The experiments examined the effects of CDP on the partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) at one trial a day. CDP injected throughout acquisition and extinction reduced the PREE. This effect was probably due to the presence of the drug during acquisition. Injected during extinction only, CDP increased resistance to extinction in both continuous and partial reinforcement groups. These effects of CDP were closely similar to those previously reported for SA, thus answering question (1) in the affirmative. The effects of CDP on the PREE were also consistent with the conditioned-frustration hypothesis (question 2).", 
    "37": "After oral doses of 30 mg of prazepam to humans, N-descyclopropylmethylprazepam (desalkylprazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam) is the only major drug-related compound in plasma. Neither the parent drug, nor its major urinary metabolites were detected in plasma. The overall concentration-time profile of desalkylprazepam in the plasma of females was lower than, and significantly different (p less than 0.001) from that in the plasma of males. However, the mean peak desalkylprazepam concentrations in the plasma of females (265 ng ml-1 +/- 60 S.D.) were not significantly different (p greater than 0.05) from those in males (342 ng ml-1 +/- 60 S.D.). Concentrations declined in the plasma of either sex with similar half-lives (mean 60 h, range 37-93 h). Apparent plasma desalkylprazepam clearances were also similar (mean 60 h, range 37-93 h). Apparent plasma desalkylprazepam clearances were also similar (mean 1.09 l h-1), range 0.74-1.84 l h-1). At 12 h after the last of multiple doses of prazepam (60 mg d-1 for 3 days) to lactating women, mean plasma concentrations of desalkylprazepam were 823 ng ml-1 +/- 200 S.D. and declined with a mean half-life of about 60 h over the time-course studied. There was only slight uptake of desalkylprazepam into blood cells; plasma; whole blood concentration ratios were constant at about 1.6. Concentrations of desalkylprazepam in milk were low at about 10 per cent of the corresponding plasma levels (e.g. 86 ng ml-1 +/- 37 S.D. at 12 h). The data suggest that, expressed on a mg kg-1 basis, exposed neonates could receive about 4 per cent of the maternal dose of prazepam as desalkylprazepam.", 
    "38": "The effects of diazepam of several cognitive and performance tasks were investigated in 30 healthy volunteers randomly assigned to three groups: A chronic group received diazepam for 21 days; an acute group received placebo during the same period, except at session 4 when they received diazepam; and a third group received placebo only at the sessions. Diazepam was given orally in a dose of about 0.2 mg/kg. Behavioral sessions were conducted before treatment (practice), after one administration (session 2), after 19 days (session 3), after 20 days (session 4), and 7 days following withdrawal (session 5). A single administration of diazepam produced significant memory impairment in both immediate and delayed free recall. Reduced memory performance was the result of impaired acquisition rather than reduced retention. Comparison of the chronic and acute groups in sessions 3 and 4 and analysis of the performance of the chronic group over sessions indicated the development of some tolerance to the memory impairment with continued administration. No residual memory effects were apparent following withdrawal. No other cognitive or psychomotor functions differed among the three treatment groups.", 
    "39": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) at 15 mg/kg produced two distinct actions in a food preference test, firstly a general appetite-enhancing effect, and secondly an anti-neophobic effect. Following acute injection of CDP the rats changed from eating predominantly familiar food to a novel food. This may signify an anti-neophobic effect of CDP. However, following 10 days of treatment with CDP, the anti-neophobic effect was abolished and the choice of familiar food was enhanced. This could be an indication of a more general appetite-enhancing effect. Hence some form of tolerance may develop to CDP's effects over 10 days of treatment which selectively abolishes anti-neophobic action whilst leaving the appetite effect further enhanced. There were no indications of tolerance developing to the actions of CDP in animals familiarized with all the test foods before the preference test was run. Hence the presence of food novelty may be critical to the observation of some form of selective tolerance.", 
    "40": "The induction of generalized tonic-clinic seizures in mice by the methylxanthine stimulant caffeine is described. These seizures are indistinguishable in quality from those induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), and pretreatment with low doses of caffeine potentiates PTZ-induced seizures. Benzodiazepines inhibit caffeine-induced seizures with a rank order potency that parallels their affinities for the central nervous system (CNS) benzodiazepine receptor in vitro. Inosine, a purine that has recently been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of [3H] diazepam binding in vitro, antagonizes caffeine-induced seizures, while 7-methyl-inosine, a purine that lacks receptor binding inhibitory activity, has no effect on seizures. Since the benzodiazepines, inosine, caffeine, and pentylenetetrazol all competitively inhibit [3H] diazepam binding and have marked effects on inducing or antagonizing seizures, further study of this receptor-ligand system may provide additional insights that concern possible biochemical mechanisms of seizures.", 
    "41": "In a 4 week study of the response of neurotic outpatients to treatment with amitriptyline, diazepam, amitriptyline and diazepam, or placebo clinical and psychophysiological variables and plasma levels of the drug were assessed. Clinical improvements were substantial in all treatment groups but clear relationships between clinical change, psychophysiological change and plasma levels of the drugs were not established. There was no relationship between plasma levels of the drugs and cigarette smoking. It is concluded that neither plasma levels of amitriptyline and diazepam nor change in skin conductance responsivity offer a useful guide to clinical response to drug treatment.", 
    "42": "1 Factors influencing steady-state plasma concentrations of diazepam (DZ) and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) were assessed in 110 male Veterans Administration outpatient clinic patients (mean age 53 years). 2 Patients reportedly had taken DZ for 1 to 14 years (mean duration 5.1 years) at a mean daily dose of 20 mg (range 2 to 55 mg). 3 Steady-state plasma concentrations of DZ (mean 329 ng/ml) and DMDZ (mean 389 ng/ml) were highly correlated (r = 0.80), with a mean DMDZ/DZ ratio of 1.26. 4 Weight-corrected daily dose were significantly correlated with plasma level of DZ (r = 0.32), DMDZ (r = 0.38) and the sum of DZ plus DMDZ (r = 0.37), but explained a small fraction of individual variation. 5 Duration of therapy, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and number of other drugs coingested were not significantly related to plasma level.", 
    "43": "In a double-blind trial tizanidine (DS 103-282: 5-Chloro-4-(2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole), a new muscle relaxant, was compared with diazepam in twenty in-patients suffering from acute paravertebral muscle spasm. All the patients had suffered from degenerative spinal disease for some years. Ten patients received tizanidine and the other ten received diazepam. Both drugs were administered t.i.d. for a period of 7 days. Significant improvements were reported in eight of the sixteen variables. Tizanidine was significantly superior to diazepam for two of these variables (lateral flexion of the lumbar spine, right and left). A centrally mediated blood-pressure-lowering effect was observed with both drugs. Tizanidine was generally better tolerated, only two patients reporting transient side-effects compared with five patients in the diazepam group. Like diazepam, tizanidine is a suitable drug for the treatment of acute paravertebral muscle spasm.", 
    "44": "The effect of naloxone on muscle tone was investigated in mice and rats at various times after administration. The naloxone effect was also tested in diazepam-pretreated animals. Naloxone was found to display muscle relaxant activity. This effect appeared to be additive to that of diazepam.", 
    "45": "The effect of ethosuximide, dipropylacetate and clonazepam on metrazol convulsions induced by a dose of 80 mg/kg was studied in 314 male albino rats aged from 5 days to adult. In a standard dose of 125 mg/kg, ethosuximide reliably protected only adult and 25-day-old rats, i.e. the age groups in which a mature minimal seizure was the only type of convulsion induced; in younger animals, not even a much higher dose (tested in 12-day-old rats) afforded reliable protection. Dipropylacetate and clonazepam had a manifest protective effect in all age groups, irrespective of the type of seizure. Isolated myoclonic jerks were less sensitive to antiepileptics and only dipropylacetate blocked them in the youngest age groups. In 21-day-old and older animals dipropylacetate induced stereotype head movement reminiscent of the serotonergic stereotypy described in the literature.", 
    "46": "A new antidepressant, zimelidine, which is a selective inhibitor of 5-HT-uptake, was tested in an open study of 13 patients, in each of whom the principal clinical diagnosis was phobic neurosis. The dose varied from 200 to 300 mg daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, 6 patients dropped out of the study as they were not appreciably improved, but 7 patients definitely improved and completed a treatment course of at least 12 weeks. In these cases it was possible to observe subjective relief of symptoms, improved social function, increased working capacity and a reduced need for anxiolytics. The effect appeared similar to the previously described effects of clomipramine treatment. The incidence of side effects was low and those that occurred were mild. Tolerance was assessed as very good by the great majority of patients. The study suggests that zimelidine has a favourable effect on mild, moderate, and even in some severe phobic conditions. Some comparisons with MAO-inhibitors were made. The results are sufficiently encouraging to suggest a controlled study.", 
    "47": "Zimelidine (ZIM) and its main active metabolite norzimelidine (NZIM) have been shown to preferentially inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neuronal uptake both in vitro and in vivo while having much less effect on noradrenaline (NA) uptake. ZIM in vivo blocked the 5-HT uptake mechanism in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and spinal cord, thus indicating effects on both the ascending and descending 5-HT pathways. ZIM is devoid of a 5-HT releasing action, MAO-inhibitory properties and effects on dopamine (DA) uptake. ZIM failed to reduce NA turnover even in high doses, but markedly reduced 5-HT turnover in very low doses in the rat. ZIM also enhanced 5-HT mediated behaviours in mice in doses related to the inhibition of 5-HT uptake. In contrast to amitriptyline (AMI) and mianserin (MIAN), ZIM only in extremely high doses displayed a 5-HT receptor blocking action in vitro and failed to block 5-HT mediated behaviour. ZIM was practically devoid of action on histamine H1 and H2 receptors, and had also a neglible action on noradrenergic alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors, and on beta-receptors. Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants (TAD's) ZIM had a negligible action on muscarinic receptors and failed to affect cholinergic induced activity. Long-term treatment with ZIM did not result in any attenuation of the 5-HT uptake blocking potency or the reduction of 5-HT turnover. This long-term treatment slightly reduced the number of beta-receptors in the brain. However, repeated ZIM-treatment induced a new 5-HT receptor binding site characterized by a low affinity and with a high number of binding sites and decreased the number of high affinity 5-HT receptor binding sites. Unlike the TAD's zimelidine failed to block the action of reserpine. Metabolic and behavioural interactions studies in mice showed that ZIM was devoid of any significant interactions with ethanol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines. It is concluded that ZIM markedly differs from both the TAD's and new antidepressants such as mianserin and nomifensine. ZIM seems preferentially to effect the presynaptic 5-HT reuptake mechanism while having a negligible action on noradrenergic, 5-HT, acetylcholine and histamine receptors in the brain.", 
    "48": "The myotonolytic activity of a new muscle-relaxant, DS 103-282, was compared with that of diazepam in a randomized double-blind study on thirty patients suffering from acute muscular spasm due to disorders of the cervical and lumbar segments of the spine. Fifteen patients received 5 mg DS 103-282 and fifteen received 5 mg diazepam on a three times daily regime for 7 days. DS 103-282 was found to alleviate symptoms and improve mobility to a significant degree (p less than or equal to 0.05) in all parameters evaluated and was also significantly superior to diazepam in 5 of these. Onset of action was particularly rapid for DS 103-282. Both medications were well tolerated and there was no significant difference between them. On the basis of these data DS 103-282 may be considered a more powerful and faster-acting myotonolytic agent than diazepam with which it was compared in similar clinical indications.", 
    "49": "The use of affinity chromatography as means of isolating/purifying proteins which have an affinity for benzodiazepine is described. Three such drugs are employed: chlorazepate, clonazepam and delorazepam. The results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed technique only works for chlorazepate and delorazepam. In fact these benzodiazepine-Sepharose derivatives are able to retain specifically proteins from human serum and rat kidney, lung, skeletal muscle and brain.", 
    "50": "The present study was undertaken to explore whether there may be age-related changes in benzodiazepine binding and in the functional interaction between GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites. Data indicate an increase in benzodiazepine binding sites with age. Moreover the functional interactions between GABA and benzodiazepine receptor sites are differentially affected by aging. GABA is less active in enhancing benzodiazepine binding in the older animals because of the loss of GABA receptors, and Diazepam may be more active in enhancing GABA receptor binding in the aged animals because there are more benzodiazepine receptors in this group. An understanding of the relevance of the apparent alteration in coupling between GABA and benzodiazepine receptors must permit a better definition of the behavioral manifestation of their biochemical phenomenon.", 
    "51": "The ontogenesis of the 3H-diazepam binding sites and their modulation by gamma-aminobutyric acid have been studied in different brain areas of rat at various ages, using frozen and two Triton X-100 treated crude synaptic membrane preparations. Benzodiazepine recognition sites are present at birth in all the brain regions investigated and reach adult levels about 3 weeks later. The changes of 3H-diazepam binding with age are due to an increase in the total number of binding sites. In vitro addition of GABA produces, in newborn and adult cerebral cortex, an increase in affinity, but not in number of binding sites for 3H-diazepam. The effect is age dependent.", 
    "52": "Several purines have been shown to be competitive inhibitors of [3H] diazepam binding. Inosine has also been shown to have benzodiazepine-like neurophysiologic, pharmacologic and behavioral effects, and to partially inhibit caffeine-induced seizures in mice. Using presumptive therapeutic doses of inosine, levels were determined in mouse brain at various times following injection. Inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations in brain increased several fold following inosine administration, indicating that inosine permeated the blood-brain barrier. The levels of inosine and hypoxanthine attained in brain were sufficient to inhibit by more than 50% the GABA-stimulated [3H] diazepam binding. These data suggest that the anticonvulsant properties of inosine are related to its interaction with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "53": "Clinical reports have described age-altered pharmacological effects of anxiolytic drugs especially an increased susceptibility to their sedative actions. In order to test whether such changes may be due to age-related alterations in central benzodiazepine receptors, 3H-flunitrazepam binding was assayed in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of young, mature and senescent rats. The numbers of 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites and their affinity was determined by Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms and the relative abundance of type I and type II benzodiazepine receptors was assessed by drug-inhibition studies using diazepam and the triazolopyridazine, CL 218,872. In addition, age related changes in the kidney and hippocampus of the Ro5-4864-sensitive benzodiazepine receptor were studied using 3H-Ro5-4864. No age-related alterations were noted in the binding characteristics of 3H-flunitrazepam. Furthermore, drug-inhibition of 3H-flunitrazepam binding by diazepam and CL 218,872 was nearly identical in young, mature and senescent rats, indicating that also the ratio of type I and type II receptors does not change with age. Binding of 3H-Ro5-4864 to membranes from rat hippocampus was not age-related. However, a significant decrease in 3H-Ro5-4864 binding to kidney membranes was demonstrated. Hence, central benzodiazepine receptors appear unaltered in the senescent rat model of aging. The clinical findings of an increased susceptibility to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the elderly may therefore be attributed to pharmacokinetic variables, or to events occurring secondarily to receptor activation.", 
    "54": "Membranes were isolated from the cerebral cortices of rat brain and submitted to binding with 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FNZP). Specific binding gave a hyperbolic saturation curve reaching a maximum between 10 - 12 nM suggesting a single population of sites. By Scatchard analysis a KD = 4 nM and a Bmax = 407 fmol/mg protein was obtained; the Hill number was 0.97. The effect of Triton X-100 was analyzed between concentrations of 6.4 x 10(-8) and 5 x 10(-1)%. With 6.4 x 10(-6) and 6.4 x 10(-3)% there is an activation of the binding without loss of protein. This activation is not reversed by washing. At 6.4 x 10(-2)% or higher concentrations there is an inhibition that is partially reversed and also solubilization of some receptors. The activation with low detergent is due to an increase in Bmax without change in KD. With 2 x 10(-1)% and 5 x 10(-1)% Triton X-100 there is considerable decrease in Bmax and in th latter case, an increase in affinity, as well. The results obtained through the action of Triton X-100 suggest that a proportion of benzodiazepine receptors are localized presynaptically. There findings are discussed in relation to previous studies from this laboratory on the localization of other central receptors with reference to the synaptic region.", 
    "55": "Light microscopic autoradiographical localization of drug and neurotransmitter receptors provides investigators with a tool to determine the sites of drug action with a high degree of anatomical resolution. In the cortex, where there is a distinct laminar organization, the differential distribution of receptors can be determined. We have found that differences in the density of specific receptors exist between layers of the cerebral cortex. Our observations include the localization of muscarinic cholinergic, benzodiazepine, opiate, neurotensin, histamine-H1, alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and high-affinity GABA receptors in the cerebral cortex. Of this list of neurotransmitters only significant concentrations of benzodiazepine, GABA, and beta-adrenergic receptors were found in the cerebellar cortex. Receptor localizations such as these can be coupled with information from immunohistochemical studies to provide the basis for future experimentation in order to define neurotransmitter-specific pathways in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices.", 
    "56": "Prior to taste aversion conditioning with morphine, diazepam or delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC), rats received pre-exposures to the vehicle or one of the three drugs. Morphine pre-exposures blocked the aversion normally induced by morphine, but not by delta 9-THC or diazepam. Diazepam pre-exposures attenuated both the morphine- and diazepam-induced taste aversions to a significantly greater degree than the taste aversion induced by delta 9-THC. As a result of delta 9-THC pre-exposures, the aversions induced by diazepam and delta 9-THC were attenuated as well as the morphine-induced aversion, which was the most greatly attenuated. These results demonstrate that pre-exposure effects are not necessarily bi-directional and, moreover, they are inconsistent with current hypotheses which attempt to account for the attenuating effect of drug pre-exposures on taste-aversion conditioning.", 
    "57": "The literature on the effects of drugs on the acquisition and the magnitude of taste aversion is reviewed and discussed. Then, the results of a series of experiments on the effects of phenobarbital and related drugs on taste aversion are reported. A standard taste aversion model was used in all experiments; test drugs were injected prior to drinking in a one bottle situation on the first test day following the taste aversion treatment. Phenobarbital in doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg/kg significantly attenuated taste aversion induced by lithium chloride (LiCl) and x-radiation, the maximal effect occurred with the 60 mg/kg dose. The attenuating effect was found to be dependent upon the magnitude of the aversion to the sapid solution. Phenobarbital completely abolished aversion produced by 0.375 mEq LiCl while the attenuation effect decreased linearly with higher doses of LiCl. Results also indicate that phenobarbital's attenuating effect cannot be solely attributed to its dipsogenic characteristic or to its state dependent learning effect. Attenuation of LiCl aversion to a saccharin solution was also observed following single doses of amobarbital, 30 mg/kg, pentobarbital, 15 mg/kg, and chloropromazine, 0.75 mg/kg. Taste aversion was not affected by other doses of those drugs or by hexobarbital, barbital, and chlordiazepoxide. Phenobarbital's attenuating effect on taste aversion is discussed in relation to other known behavioral and neurophysiological effects of the drug.", 
    "58": "Membrane structure in intact human erythrocytes was analyzed by electron-spin-resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The spin probes 5-doxyl stearate and 5-doxyl stearate methyl ester revealed thermally-induced structural transitions in the membrane at 37 degree C and 15 degree C. The addition of propranolol, diazepam, chlorpromazine, or Pluronic F68 all caused a decrease in the temperature of the upper transition, but did not markedly alter the temperature of the lower transition. In addition, diazepam caused a significant decrease in the ordering or packing of the membrane-lipid acyl chains. It is proposed here that the protection from hypotonic hemolysis that has been reported in the presence of these drugs is mediated by a structural rearrangement in the erythrocyte membrane involving a change in protein-lipid interactions.", 
    "59": "A short update about the data accumulated so far on the brain-specific binding sites of the benzodiazepines is the subject of this paper. Today, a large variety of biochemical and pharmacological data clearly indicates that these benzodiazepine receptors are the endogenous targets which mediate the pharmacological effects of the benzodiazepines. Furthermore, considerable evidence suggests that the benzodiazepine receptor serves as an amplifying system for GABAergic transmission by increasing the affinity of the GABA receptor. Since the physiological function of this receptor and its endogenous ligand are not yet known, one of the major topics of future research will be to finally identify the endogenous ligand(s) of the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "60": "Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate has recently been isolated from human urine and it was proposed that derivatives of this compound might be related to an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors. In the present study we investigated high-affinity binding of [3H]propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]PrCC) to rat brain membranes. [3H]PrCC binds specifically and with high affinity (half-maximal binding at ca. 1nM) to rat brain membranes. The regional and subcellular distributions of specific [3H]PrCC binding are similar, but not identical, to the distributions of [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]-diazepam binding. The total numbers of binding sites labelled by [3H]PrCC and [3H]flunitrazepam in rat cerebellum are closely similar, and both ligands bind to cerebellar membranes in a mutually exclusive way. The pharmacological selectivity of [3H]PrCC and [3H]diazepam binding is almost identical. Binding of [3H]PrCC like binding of [3H]diazepam, can be increased in vitro by muscimol, GABA and SQ 20.009. Although subtle differences in binding characteristics were observed, these results indicate that [3H]PrCC and benzodiazepines bind to a common recognition site on benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "61": "The morphological demonstration of BR in GABAergic synapses is a major step forward in the understanding of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. It bridges the gap between the electrophysiological evidence stressing the involvement of GABAergic synaptic transmission in the action of benzodiazepines, and the biochemical evidence stressing BR as the site of action for this group of drugs. At present we do not know in which types of synapses those BR are localized which were not associated with GAD positive terminals. At least some of the silver grains may nevertheless be localized in GABAergic terminals, since probably not all GABAergic terminals were stained immunocytochemically. However, it is also possible that some BR are localized in non-GABAergic synaptic contact regions. This possibility would open new concepts for our understanding of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines and is presently under experimental investigation."
