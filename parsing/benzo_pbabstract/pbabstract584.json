    "0": "The effects of FG 7142 were examined in the social interaction test, alone and in combination with chlordiazepoxide, Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216. The anxiogenic action of FG 7142 (5 mg/kg) was reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) and by Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg), but not by CGS 8216 (10 mg/kg). The profile of FG 7142 in this test and the pattern of its interactions with other compounds is similar to that of beta-CCE, but can be distinguished from that of Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216. It is concluded that FG 7142, Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 may act via different sites to produce their anxiogenic effects.", 
    "1": "The comparative action of two specific benzodiazepine antagonists, Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-3505 was examined in six healthy volunteers. Medication was given i.v. in a double-blind cross over pattern, and EEG was recorded throughout each experimental session. Ten minutes after the injection of one of the antagonists or placebo, midazolam was injected in incremental doses until first signs of drowsiness appeared in the EEG. The EEG was computer analyzed, using adaptive segmentation and time-dependent clustering. Continuous power profiles for various frequency bands, as well as power ratios for the physiological frequency bands (e.g. sigma/alpha power ratio) were generated. It has been found that sigma/alpha power ratio was the most sensitive parameter detecting early effects of midazolam on the EEG signal, thus enabling a semi-quantitative titration of the antagonists by midazolam. Ro 15-1788 in doses of 5 mg i.v. was counteracted on average by 7.3 mg midazolam. From the EEG analysis it has been found that Ro 15-3505 was at least 4-5 times more potent than Ro 15-1788.", 
    "2": "Diazepam (0.4-4 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the spontaneous tonic activity in the electromyogram (EMG) recorded from the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle of spastic mutant Han-Wistar rats in a dose-dependent manner. The muscle relaxant effect of diazepam was antagonized by the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg i.p.), beta-CCM (2 mg/kg i.p.) and CGS 8216 (5 mg/kg i.p.), but not by EMD 41717 (50 mg/kg i.p.). These results add further support to the hypothesis that Ro 15-1788, CGS 8216 and beta-CCM do antagonize all pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines while EMD 41717 displays more selectivity in antagonizing the different actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "3": "In order to establish whether cholinergic receptors mediate GH secretion induced by TRH in insulin-dependent diabetes, 10 patients were treated with pirenzepine, an anticholinergic agent, and tested with TRH. Basal concentrations of GH were elevated in these patients and 8 of 10 patients responded to TRH with a significant rise in GH levels. Pretreatment with pirenzepine (40 mg given iv 10 min before TRH) suppressed the TRH-induced GH rise. Pirenzepine had no effect on TRH-induced TSH release. This finding suggests that a cholinergic mechanism is involved in the paradoxical response of GH to TRH in diabetic patients.", 
    "4": "The clinical characteristics and management of patients who abuse high doses of benzodiazepines are not well described. In a prospective open study, 23 subjects who abused high doses of benzodiazepines were admitted for detoxification. Urine or blood test results confirmed benzodiazepine use in all but one subject and multiple drug use in eight (35%). Median benzodiazepine dose was 150 mg (range 40 to 500 mg) of diazepam equivalent. Initial plasma concentrations (diazepam: median = 1245 ng/ml; desmethyldiazepam: median = 2961 ng/ml) were 400% to 800% higher than usual therapeutic concentrations. For detoxification, subjects were given a loading dose of diazepam equal to approximately 40% their reported daily consumption. This was followed with daily tapering of diazepam by 10%. This regimen resulted in a slow and gradual decline in drug concentrations. Withdrawal symptoms were assessed daily. Sixteen subjects completed detoxification in the hospital without complications. One subject became paranoid and confused on day 7 of withdrawal. This was attributed to a too-low initial loading dose and too-rapid tapering, which resulted in rapid drug elimination. Gradual reduction of diazepam dose appears to be an effective and safe approach for detoxifying abusers of high doses of benzodiazepines.", 
    "5": "Healthy subjects received single doses of diazepam (5 to 10 mg iv), lorazepam (2 mg iv), or alprazolam (1 mg orally) on two occasions, once in the control state and once with propranolol, 80 mg three times a day. Compliance with the propranolol regimen was verified by measurement of serum propranolol levels (overall means: 100 ng/ml) and by reduction in sensitivity to intravenous metaproterenol to one-thirtieth that of the control value. Propranolol prolonged diazepam elimination t1/2 (58 and 49 hr), reduced its clearance (0.20 and 0.24 ml/min/kg), and increased the 168-hr AUC for desmethyldiazepam, the major metabolite of diazepam (5.63 and 4.81 micrograms/ml . hr). Propranolol had no significant effect on lorazepam t1/2 (13.2 and 12.7 hr) or clearance (1.33 and 1.36 ml/min/kg), nor on alprazolam t1/2 (15.9 and 18.5 hr) or clearance (1.1 and 0.8 ml/min/kg). Thus propranolol induces a small but significant reduction in clearance of diazepam, biotransformed mainly by the oxidative reaction of N-demethylation. Propranolol does not impair lorazepam clearance by glucuronide conjugation nor that of alprazolam by aliphatic hydroxylation.", 
    "6": "Experiments were performed on 14 anaesthetized, artifically ventilated dogs, in which efferent activity in the phrenic nerve was recorded and blood-gas tensions, arterial pH and core temperature were controlled. Doses of midazolam between 0.2 mg kg-1 and 2 mg kg-1 abolished phrenic nerve activity for periods between 30 and 90 min. Ro 15-1788 in doses between 0.06 mg kg-1 and 1 mg kg-1 and Ro 15-3505 0.2-2 mg kg-1 reversed the effects of midazolam on phrenic nerve activity. Prior administration of these drugs either abolished or greatly inhibited the action of midazolam. When the preparations were observed for up to 2 h, there was no evidence of return of the action of midazolam, suggesting that both antagonists had a duration of action at least as long as that of midazolam.", 
    "7": "In vitro studies using the rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation were performed to investigate the effects of diazepam and three of its metabolites on indirectly evoked twitch tension. Diazepam, desmethyldiazepam and temazepam alone caused an increase in twitch tension in lower concentrations, followed by complete depression in higher concentrations. Oxazepam did not cause an initial increase in twitch tension, but showed an immediate and dose-dependent depression. Cumulative concentration-response curves for pancuronium and suxamethonium in the presence of different concentrations of diazepam or oxazepam showed that small concentrations of diazepam, which did not change twitch tension alone, caused antagonism of the action of pancuronium, but not of suxamethonium. With oxazepam no such antagonism was observed. In liminal and supraliminal concentrations, both diazepam and oxazepam potentiated the action of pancuronium and suxamethonium. Possible implications for in vivo interactions are discussed.", 
    "8": "Moving rats from their home cages to a different environment for a twenty minute period tended to raise plasma glucose levels (PGLs). In general, the more different the novel environment was from the housing condition, the greater the rise in PGL. Stimulus contexts that have led to conditioned hyperglycemia in previous experiments caused a larger rise in PGLs than stimulus contexts that led to conditioned hypoglycemia in previous experiments. These glycemic effects of environmental novelty did not habituate across seven exposure periods. Experiment 2 showed that chlordiazepoxide (CDP) reduced PGLs in animals transported to novel environments. Experiment 2 also showed that conditioned hyperglycemia occurred when insulin was administered in the environment that led to the highest PGLs in Experiment 1, and that conditioned hypoglycemia occurred in this same environment when the animals were regularly pretreated with CDP. Administering insulin in an environment that did not initially elicit a large rise in PGL resulted in a tendency towards conditioned hypoglycemia that was not influenced by CDP.", 
    "9": "H2-antagonists, antacids and pirenzepine are effective drugs for prophylaxis of stress ulcer bleeding. Combined medication seems to be superior to single medication, but investigations of the effectiveness of a pirenzepine-antacid prophylaxis have not been carried out. We therefore evaluated the effect of this combination on gastric pH and on prevention of stress bleeding in ICU patients. In a prospective controlled randomized study 33 patients in each group received 50 mg. pirenzepine intravenously as a basic medication and alternatively 2000 mg. cimetidine i.v. or 2-hourly 10 ml. antacid. Gastric pH was determined three times per day. Stress bleeding was defined as bloody gastric juice, haematemesis or melaena. Two stress bleedings could be detected in each group. The pirenzepine-antacid combination proved to be superior to ensure a gastric pH of more than 3.5 than the pirenzepine-cimetidine group. After removal of the nasogastric tube the 2-hourly application of antacids proved to be impracticable.", 
    "10": "The combination of fentanyl and droperidol, Innovar, was compared to flunitrazepam (1-2 mg) in a higher dosage (2.5-5 ml) for i.m. premedication. We measured psychological (ESB) and physiological (blood pressure, heart rate, p.cortisol) stress parameters before and after premedication. Side effects were registered. The day after surgery the patients were asked about the quality of premedication. Flunitrazepam reduced anxiety; Innovar did not. After Innovar the feeling of weakness increased significantly compared to flunitrazepam. Two patients panicked and refused operation. Other severe side effects were not observed. There were slight advantages for flunitrazepam on physiological stress. Patients were more satisfied with flunitrazepam than with Innovar premedication. The results show that Innovar also in a higher dosage cannot be recommended for premedication.", 
    "11": "The binding of agonists to muscarinic cholinergic receptors is well described by a binding model of multiple affinity states (superhigh, high, and low) in most central and peripheral tissues. Although previous studies of the influences by divalent cations, guanine nucleotides, and sulfhydryl reagents support the concept that these regulators act through closely related sites to alter the relative proportions of muscarinic agonist affinity states, it has become apparent that muscarinic receptor subtypes (as defined with the nonclassical antagonist pirenzepine) are differentially affected by the regulators. For example, in tissues that have few high-affinity [3H]pirenzepine-binding sites (heart, ileum, cerebellum), magnesium ions promote the formation of a high agonist affinity state, whereas exposure of these tissues to the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or guanine nucleotides promotes the formation of a low agonist affinity state. Conversely, tissues rich in high-affinity [3H]pirenzepine-binding sites (cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus) show little, if any, change in agonist binding site affinity when magnesium ions or guanine nucleotides are present. Furthermore, NEM enhances the muscarinic binding site affinity for agonists in these tissues. Taken together, these results support the concept of muscarinic receptor heterogeneity, as proposed from previous physiological studies, and indicate that the aforementioned regulators (guanine nucleotides, magnesium ions, NEM) differentially alter the agonist-binding properties of these muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "12": "The combination of diazepam plus pethidine, reversed with naloxone, was compared in a double-blind randomized study with diazepam alone in 100 patients undergoing endoscopy. Patients accepted both methods of sedation equally well. There was no significant difference in sedation after endoscopy, but the addition of pethidine produced a significant improvement in patient co-operation during the endoscopy (P less than 0.001).", 
    "13": "The authors studied the parameters of sustained released Tofizopam microcapsules, prepared by a melt-dispersion method. The parameters examined were the flowing rate, strength and dissolution characteristics. Dissolution curves were linearized by the RRSBW distribution. The factorial design method proved to be very useful for examination of microcapsules.", 
    "14": "Exposure of young rats (9-10 wks) to chronic summer heat (36 degrees C) or acute heat (38 degrees C 4hr) increased the BBB permeability to Evans blue albumin complex (MW 68,000) and 131I-sodium (MW 154) in different brain regions which correlated well with the increased level of 5-HT in plasma and brain. This increased permeability of BBB and the increased 5-HT level were prevented by pretreatment with p-CPA, indomethacin and diazepam. Cyproheptadine and vinblastine pretreatment however, prevented only the increased permeability of BBB, the plasma and brain 5-HT level continued to remain high. These results indicate a probable role of 5-HT as one of the factors leading to the increased permeability of BBB in young rats following heat stress.", 
    "15": "Breathing pattern, thoracoabdominal motion, and separate end-expiratory positions of the rib cage and abdomen were measured noninvasively in eight healthy subjects before and after intravenous administration of either placebo or midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine. Compared with placebo, midazolam produced a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in mean inspiratory flow of 29% from preinjection values, resulting in a 39% reduction in tidal volume (VT). This ventilatory depression was partly compensated by a 35% decrease in expiratory time producing an increase in respiratory rate (+39%). The fall in VT was almost entirely (91%) mediated by a reduction of the abdominal contribution to tidal breathing while sparing rib cage motion. This fact contrasts with the effects of inhalational anesthetics or morphine, which preferentially depress rib cage expansion, indicating that thoracoabdominal motion may selectively be depressed by different pharmacological agents. In addition, continuous recording of end-expiratory levels showed a significant transient fall in the rib cage's end-tidal position 2 min after midazolam administration associated with the occurrence of central apneas.", 
    "16": "Imidazobenzodiazepine (Ro 15-1788, 5 mg/kg) similarly to a lose dose of apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg) decreased the intensity of footshock aggression in male rats. Ro 15-1788 significantly potentiated the antiaggressive action of apomorphine. Pirenperone (0.01 mg/kg) potentiated the effect of both drugs, whereas haloperidol (0.01 mg/kg) had an opposite action. After long-term treatment with apomorphine and Ro 15-1788 the tolerance to their antiaggressive action developed. This change was in agreement with increased serotonin metabolism in the forebrain. Unlike the action on aggressive behavior, Ro 15-1788 similarly to haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg) decreased the motor depressant effect of apomorphine (0.01 mg/kg) in mice. This effect correlated with the lowered serotonin metabolism after Ro 15-1788 administration. Unlike apomorphine, Ro 15-1788 reversed catalepsy induced by haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg). Administration of pirenperone (0.03 mg/kg) and destruction of serotoninergic terminals by p-chloroamphetamine (2 X 15 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the sedative action of apomorphine. It appears that different action of Ro 15-1788 on behavioral effects of apomorphine is related to different influence of Ro-1788 on serotoninergic processes in the striatum and limbic structures.", 
    "17": "After reviewing a number of recent concepts of the anatomy of the cerebral noradrenergic systems, the authors examines the effects of several representative drugs of each of the three major classes of psychotropic drugs (neuroleptics, antidepressants, tranquilizers) on sleep. The effects of the neuroleptics on the paradoxical phase of sleep can be explained by the particular features of the organization of the cerebral noradrenergic systems. The antidepressants reduce the paradoxical phase by a number of mechanisms related to their principal pharmacological properties of inhibition of monoamine uptake and the anticholinergic effect. The benzodiazepine tranquillizers have a complex action on sleep, probably acting via several mechanisms. Newly developed benzodiazepine receptor antagonists enable us to distinguish some of these effects. The sensitivity of sleep to a large number of drugs is a useful tool for the functional investigation of the central nervous system.", 
    "18": "Central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors were looked for in the spinal cord, cerebral cortex and cerebellum of the cat. Both [3H]Ro 15-1788 and [3H]flunitrazepam bound to benzodiazepine receptors with apparent dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range and Hill coefficients near unity. The concentration of binding sites was much greater (10-40 times,depending on the ligand used) in the cortex and cerebellum than in the spinal cord. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) significantly reduced the KD value of the binding of tritiated flunitrazepam in all three areas of the central nervous system (CNS). The displacement of [3H]Ro 15-1788 by different benzodiazepine ligands indicates a relative prevalence of BZ1 (high affinity for beta-carboline esters and the triazolopyridazine, CL 218 872) in the cerebellum, a predominance of BZ2 (low affinity for the same agents) in the spinal cord and a mixture of both types in the cortex. The possibility that there is regional heterogeneity of receptors for benzodiazepines in CNS of the cat is discussed.", 
    "19": "Previous metabolic studies have established that two major metabolites, 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam, are present in plasma after dosing with quazepam, a new benzodiazepine hypnotic. The excretion of quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam, and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam into human breast milk was studied in four lactating nonpregnant volunteers. Each volunteer received one 15-mg quazepam tablet following an overnight fast. Nursing of offspring was discontinued after drug administration. Milk and blood samples were collected prior to and at specified times (up to 48 hours) after dosing. Plasma and milk levels of quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam, and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam were determined by specific GLC methods. The concentrations of the three compounds found in milk appeared to depend on their relative lipophilicities, which were determined by log P values. The mean milk/plasma AUC ratios of quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam, and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam were 4.19, 2.02, and 0.091, respectively. Levels of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam declined at about the same rate in plasma and in milk. The total amount of the administered quazepam dose found in the milk as quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam, and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam through 48 hours was only 0.11 per cent.", 
    "20": "Twelve healthy volunteers received a single 40-mg oral dose of the benzodiazepine derivative oxazolam, which serves primarily as a precursor of the active substance desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ). Concentrations of DMDZ were measured in multiple serum samples drawn for up to two weeks after the dose. Peak serum DMDZ concentrations averaged 115 ng/ml, measured at 8.6 hours after dosage. Mean DMDZ elimination half-life averaged 61 hours. Three of the subjects also received 40 mg each of prazepam and clorazepate, two other DMDZ precursors, on separate occasions. Although DMDZ elimination half-life was similar, total area under the curve (AUC) for DMDZ was larger for clorazepate, known to be completely transformed into DMDZ, than for oxazolam or prazepam the extent of whose conversion to DMDZ has not been previously established. After correcting for the different molar equivalent of DMDZ available from each preparation, the DMDZ ratio averaged 0.22 for oxazolam vs. clorazepate and 0.51 for prazepam vs. clorazepate. Thus, both oxazolam and prazepam lead to slow appearance of DMDZ in the systemic circulation. Furthermore the extent of DMDZ formation from oxazolam and prazepam is either incomplete or the drugs are incompletely absorbed. Equivalent doses of oxazolam, prazepam, and clorazepate should not be interchanged in clinical practice.", 
    "21": "A comparative toxicity and carcinogenicity study was carried out for 2 years with estazolam, a benzodiazepine, via diet in Sprague-Dawley rats (0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg/day) and in B6C3F1 mice (0.8, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day). In rats, no biologically significant changes were seen with respect to mortality, clinical signs, food consumption, or occurrence of palpable masses. Body weight gain in females (10 mg/kg/day) was depressed 12.6% and reflected a maximum-tolerated dosage (females). Spontaneous and incidental nonneoplastic lesions were consistent with aging in this species and unrelated to drug treatment. No biologically significant differences in tumor incidences occurred. Mice were more responsive to estazolam as suggested by (1) increased mortality (males) at 10 mg/kg/day, (2) increased food consumption and body weight gains (females), (3) withdrawal signs characterized by hyperactivity/aggressiveness and convulsions, and (4) appearance of dose-related nodular hyperplasia of the liver due to the relatively high dosages used coupled with the propensity of benzodiazepines to enhance liver enzyme induction. Several spontaneous benign and malignant tumors observed in all groups were not considered to be drug related. Based on the findings in these studies, estazolam was not considered to be carcinogenic when administered via diet to either rats at 0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg/day or to mice at 0.8, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day for 2 consecutive years.", 
    "22": "Four groups of rats were given free choice between water and solutions of either 3 micrograms/ml etonitazene, 5% ethanol (v/v), 0.1 mg/ml diazepam or 3 mg/ml barbital for 10-14 days. With the exception of barbital, some rats spontaneously preferred the drug solutions to water. This preference was reduced by addition of 7 micrograms/ml haolperidol. In a forced drug fluid consumption procedure, the daily administration of 15 mg/kg i.p. of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-transaminase blocker aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) led to a reduction of ethanol and diazepam intake, but not of etonitazene and barbital. It is suggested that the diminished consumption of ethanol and diazepam as caused by GABA-T-inhibition may also be mediated by dopamine which seems to act indirectly, via benzodiazepine receptors and GABA neurons.", 
    "23": "The effects of picrotoxin, bicuculline or RO 15-1788 on the anti-conflict action(s) of diazepam or ethanol were studied in rats using a modified Vogel's conflict test procedure. RO 15-1788 antagonized the anti-punishment effects of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, IP), whereas various doses of bicuculline or picrotoxin did not interfere with diazepam's anti-conflict effect in this test situation. The anti-conflict action of ethanol (2 g/kg, IP) was antagonized by picrotoxin (1.0 mg/kg, IP), whereas both bicuculline and RO 15-1788 were without effect on the increased punishment response produced by ethanol. These data suggest that the anti-conflict properties of ethanol are at least partially mediated through an enhancement of central GABAergic activity.", 
    "24": "There is now considerable evidence that opioid agonists and benzodiazepines increase food and water intake in a variety of animal species. The appetitive effects of the novel opioid-benzodiazepine tifluadom have been investigated. (+/-)-Tifluadom significantly increased food intake in freely-feeding rats. This stimulation of appetite was attributable principally to the activity of the (+)-isomer. Furthermore tifluadom-induced feeding was blocked by the opioid antagonists naloxone, naltrexone, Mr 1452 and Mr 2266 but not by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist ICI 154, 129, or by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. These results suggest that tifluadom exerts its effect on food intake by interaction with opioid as opposed to benzodiazepine receptors and that this activity is mediated by kappa and/or mu- rather than delta-opioid receptor sub-types.", 
    "25": "It has been demonstrated in experiments on rats receiving chronic (16 days) treatment with haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg/day), sulpiride (50 mg/kg/day) and clozapine (10 mg/kg/day) that binding of 3H-flunitrazepam in the striatum, limbic system, and cortex is reduced at the 5th day after withdrawal of the neuroleptics. That release was determined by the diminution of the number of receptors without changing in the dissociation constant. The reduction in the density of benzodiazepine receptors (BD-receptors) after withdrawal of the neuroleptics attests to their agonistic effect on BD-receptors. Apparently these changes are not linked with a direct effect of the neuroleptics on BD-receptors, since they displace 3H-flunitrazepam in experiments in vitro only at micromolar concentrations. It is assumed that the reduction in 3H-flunitrazepam binding is mediated via the GABAergic system transsynaptically in response to increase in the number of dopamine (neuroleptic) receptors.", 
    "26": "Chromatography of an acidic extract from bovine brain cortex on a Sephadex G-10 column demonstrated 7 fractions capable of inhibiting specific binding of 3H-diazepam to brain cortex membranes. It was established by ultrafiltration that the molecular weights of the inhibitors were not higher than 5000 dalton. Scatchard analysis of 4 main fractions has revealed a type of inhibition similar to the competitive one. Activity of all the fractions remained unchanged after pronase treatment.", 
    "27": "Neuropharmacological analysis of previously revealed antihypoxic activity of benzodiazepines (BDZ) has been performed in experiments on mice exposed to hypoxia. Antihypoxic effect of diazepam is shown to be antagonized by the central BDZ receptor blocker, Ro 15-1788. A certain degree of antihypoxic activity also abolished by Ro 15-1788 is exhibited by hypothetical ligands of BDZ receptors: inosin, nicotinamide, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. The effect of dipyridamole, a drug with high affinity for BDZ receptors of the peripheral type is not antagonized by Ro 15-1788, another evidence of Ro 15-1788 affinity precisely to the central BDZ receptors. GABA-mimetics (muscimol and GABA cetyl ester) were also found to have marked antihypoxic activity. Unlike BDZ receptor agonists, this effect is reduced by bicuculline and not by Ro 15-1788. The data obtained suggest that antihypoxic activity of BDZ is caused by their direct interaction with the central BDZ receptors, probably with the type which is not modulated by GABAA receptors.", 
    "28": "Rational use of psychoactive drugs in frail elderly patients requires an understanding of the physiologic changes produced by aging and chronic disease. Other drugs being used and the patient's nutritional status and lifestyle also must be considered. Affective disorders and thought disorders may be effectively treated with much lower doses of appropriate psychoactive drugs than those commonly prescribed. Benzodiazepines are poorly tolerated by old persons because of paradoxic responses and frequent adverse reactions.", 
    "29": "GABA is one of the principal inhibitory neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain and an ever increasing wealth of information suggests that GABAergic mechanisms have a special role in the neurophysiology of anxiety. All of the most commonly used antianxiety drugs (the benzodiazepines, the barbiturates, ethanol) selectively enhance only GABA-mediated synaptic transmission. Furthermore, the relative affinities of pharmacologically active benzodiazepines for the benzodiazepine receptor correlate well with their ability to antagonize GABA-modulin (the endogenous inhibitor of GABA receptors) in vitro, as well as with their ability to potentiate GABA-mediated electrically evoked cortical inhibition in vivo. Finally, it is of interest for the neurophysiology of anxiety that repetitive stimulation of the recurrent inhibitory GABAergic pathway in the rat hippocampus leads to a remarkable reduction of the effectiveness of GABA; this elimination of GABAergic \"inhibition\" is counteracted by antianxiety drugs. On the basis of the above a neurophysiological model of anxiety is proposed.", 
    "30": "Excitatory junction currents produced by glutamate were recorded with an extracellular electrode at the neuromuscular junction of the crayfish. Pentobarbitone, phenobarbitone, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and procaine had only minimal effects on current decay at concentrations which are highly effective in other preparations. The glutamate synapse in the crayfish appears relatively resistant to these drugs. In contrast, ether and halothane increased the rate of decay of the currents at concentrations which are comparable to those occurring during anaesthesia.", 
    "31": "The effects of 40 mg nadolol versus 2 mg diazepam on performance anxiety of 33 young music students were determined. The study had a double-blind, crossover design and was placebo controlled. Nadolol attenuated the rise in pulse rate caused by anxiety and improved those aspects of string playing that can be adversely affected by tremor. There was also a tendency for other functions requiring coordination and judgment to improve. No effect on anxiety was noted for nadolol or for 2 mg diazepam. Diazepam, however, did cause some minor deterioration of performance that was not related to anxiety change. These findings, taken with others, suggest that beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs such as nadolol have an important role in the correction of anxiety-induced disturbances of performance. Indeed, their use under such circumstances probably is preferable to that of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "32": "The authors provide the reader with the pharmacologic tools useful in managing chronic pain in children. The agents discussed include the analgesics, the psychotropics, and miscellaneous anticonvulsants, antihistamines, steroids, and skeletal muscle relaxants.", 
    "33": "In a double-blind parallel-group pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study, 31 healthy volunteers received single oral doses of prazepam (10 mg), clorazepate (7.5 mg), or diazepam (5 mg). Appearance in plasma of diazepam and of desmethyldiazepam was rapid after administration of diazepam and clorazepate, respectively, with peak plasma concentrations reached within an average of 1 hour. After oral prazepam, however, desmethyldiazepam appeared in blood slowly, with the highest mean concentration at 6 hours postdosage. Clinical self-ratings of fatigue and of \"feeling spacey\" were significantly different among groups, with changes over baseline being more marked with clorazepate and diazepam than with prazepam. Thus, differences in absorption rate of orally administered benzodiazepines can lead to differences in the intensity of single-dose effects, despite administration of doses that are equivalent in terms of long-term anxiolytic efficacy.", 
    "34": "The effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 20 mg kg-1 after \"general anaesthetic\" doses of several benzodiazepines were studied in mice, in order to determine if the effects of the latter were attributable to an action at benzodiazepine receptors. Male CDI mice were used and the end-points for anaesthesia were loss of the righting reflex and loss of the foot pinch reflex. The effects of midazolam, and to a lesser extent those of chlordiazepoxide and of diazepam on these reflexes, were antagonized partially by Ro 15-1788. When the antagonist was given after high doses of flurazepam, convulsions were produced. Calculation of the likely membrane concentrations of the benzodiazepines showed that these fitted the lipid solubility correlation for general anaesthesia. Ro 15-1788 did not decrease the lethal effects of the benzodiazepines. With flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam it caused signs of hyperexcitability, which in the case of flurazepam led to the death of the animals.", 
    "35": "The atypical profile of 2-phenyl-4[2-(4-piperidinyl) ethyl]quinoline (PK 8165), a quinoline derivative with pure anticonflict properties, seems to be due to the fact that this compound is a partial agonist of benzodiazepine receptors. The drug PK 8165 is a competitive inhibitor of benzodiazepine binding sites with a Hill coefficient near unity. Opposite to 3-methyl-6-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)2,4-triazolo(4,5-b)pyridazine (CL 218,872) it was unable to discriminate between BZ1 and BZ2 receptors in sections of brain. However, modulation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the effect of photolabelling by flunitrazepam on the affinity of PK 8165 indicated that GABA or photolabelling shifts of PK 8165 were between full agonists and antagonists. By itself PK 8165 was unable to modify the levels of cGMP in the cerebellum, but potentiated the lowering of levels of cGMP by diazepam and did not present antagonistic properties of this effect.", 
    "36": "PK 8165, a new quinoline derivative, has a good affinity for brain type benzodiazepine binding sites and an anticonflict activity in the Vogel Test. However, contrarily to classical benzodiazepines (BZ) this compound is devoid of anticonvulsant and sedative properties. As biochemical studies suggested that PK 8165 is a partial agonist for BZ receptors, its interactions with convulsant, sedative and muscle relaxant properties of diazepam (DZ) were investigated. PK 8165 potentiates (12.5 to 50 mg/kg i.p.) the antagonistic effect of DZ on M.E.S.-induced seizures and footshock-induced fighting in mice. Moreover, PK 8165 potentiates in the same dose range the muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects of DZ in mice. These potentiations are specific since PK 8165 does not interfere with phenobarbital and mebubarbital effects in M.E.S. and righting reflex in mice. Also, PK 8165's anticonflict activity (punished drinking in thirsty rats) is antagonized by RO15-1788, a specific antagonist of centrally active BZ.", 
    "37": "Nitrazepam is metabolized in both humans and rats to 7-amino-nitrazepam OFFicating that this drug is reduced to a number of metabolic intermediates including several free radical species. When rat-hepatic microsomes are incubated with NADPH in the presence of nitrazepam, its nitro anion free radical was observed under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of oxygen, this free radical reduced oxygen giving nitrazepam and superoxide. 7-Nitroxyl-nitrazepam was produced by the chemical oxidation of 7-amino-nitrazepam using m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Reaction of this reactive free radical with hepatic microsomes led to the covalent spin labelling of microsomal protein. This phenomenon was also observed by the enzymic oxidation of 7-amino-nitrazepam with hepatic microsomes, obtained from a phenobarbital-induced rat, in the presence of a NADPH-generating system. With the generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (arising from the dismutation of superoxide), it is not surprising that nitrazepam-enhanced lipid peroxidation was demonstrated by monitoring the production of lipid peroxyl radicals using spin-trapping techniques.", 
    "38": "A method of labelling ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-[11C]methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (RO 15.1788 11C), a benzodiazepine antagonist with carbon-11 has been developed. RO 15.1788-11C was prepared by methylation of the nor derivative by I11CH3. About 100 mCi (maximum 153 mCi, 5.66 GBq) of the chemically and radiochemically pure labelled product were obtained within 25 min with a specific activity on average of 1100 mCi/mumol (maximum 1740 mCi/mu mol--64.4 GBq/mu mol). Preliminary results obtained after i.v. administration in the baboon have shown RO 15.1788-11C to be of interest as a benzodiazepine radioligand for the in vivo study of benzodiazepine receptors by positron emission tomography.", 
    "39": "It has been shown in experiments on rat cortex slices preincubated with 3H-GABA that chlorodiazepoxide (10(-6), 3.10(-5) M) does not change basal and electric stimulation-induced release of the label. It has been also shown that it does not eliminate the autoinhibitory effect of GABA on electric stimulation-induced release of 3H-GABA. However, harmane and some other (but not all) derivatives given at the same concentrations increase 3H-GABA release induced by electric stimulation and abolish the inhibitory effect of GABA without changing or slightly raising spontaneous release of 3H-GABA. It is concluded that harmane enhances the electrically stimulated release of the transmitter by GABAergic axons whatever the effect on benzodiazepine-binding areas of GABA receptors.", 
    "40": "Stimulation of frog sartorius muscle at 1 Hz leads to an initial positive staircase during the first 120 twitches and is followed by a negative staircase. There is a net calcium influx into two distinct compartments within the muscle during the positive staircase. The two compartments are separated by measuring the calcium extracted from muscles soaked in strontium-Ringer for 15 min and the calcium remaining in the muscle. A net gain of extractable Ca++ (0.32 mumol/g wet wt.) and residual Ca++ (0.18 mumol/g) is observed during positive staircase. A loss in residual Ca++, a gain in extractable Ca++ and a net loss of Ca++ (0.09 mumol/g) to the bathing medium occur during the period preceding physiological muscle fatigue (60 to 120 twitches). Diazepam (EC50, 5.6 X 10(-6) M) causes a marked reduction in the latent period and increases the rate constant 2.6 times the control value for physiological muscle fatigue. A net loss of 0.31 mumol/g of Ca++ to the bathing medium occurs during the interval between 60 and 120 twitches. Diazepam increases net Ca++ efflux 3.5-fold during this interval when compared to control muscles. Diazepam does not affect the Ca++ gained during the positive staircase but accelerates the loss of calcium from the residual and the extractable compartments during the initial phase of physiological muscle fatigue. Physiological muscle fatigue is attributed to an accumulation of calcium in the transverse tubular network and an uncoupling of the muscle action potential from contraction.", 
    "41": "The density of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding sites was examined 19-21 and 27-31 days after surgical isolation of the olfactory bulbs. While statistically significant reductions in [3H]flunitrazepam binding were observed in the olfactory bulbs at both intervals, a significant reduction in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding was observed only at 27-31 days after surgery. No consistent changes in the binding of either radioligand were observed in cerebella. Extirpation of the olfactory bulbs resulted in a significant reduction in the convulsant potency (but not efficacy) of Ro 5-4864, while neither the potency nor efficacy of pentylenetetrazole was affected by this procedure. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors and 'peripheral-type' binding sites for benzodiazepines are regulated independently, and that at least a subpopulation of peripheral-type binding sites are associated with neuronal elements in the olfactory bulb. These data also suggest that peripheral-type binding sites for benzodiazepines in the olfactory bulbs may influence the convulsant actions of Ro 5-4864.", 
    "42": "Ro 5-4864 is a benzodiazepine that differs from diazepam only in a p-chloro substituent and yet is inactive at the classical CNS binding sites. However it is a potent ligand for the peripheral type of benzodiazepine binding sites. PK 11195 is an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative that potently displaces [3H]-Ro 5-4864 from its binding sites. PK 11195 (30-60 mg kg-1) significantly reduced the incidence of convulsions caused by Ro 5-4864 (30 mg kg-1). PK 11195 (up to 120 mg kg-1) was ineffective at counteracting seizures caused by the convulsant benzodiazepine Ro 5-3663, although this dose did increase the latency to seize after injection with pentylenetetrazole. PK 11195 had no anticonvulsant actions against picrotoxin, and at 60 mg kg-1 reduced the latency to seize. This possible proconvulsant property of the isoquinoline was further explored. PK 11195 (30-90 mg kg-1) had proconvulsant actions when combined with subconvulsant doses of strychnine and picrotoxin, but had none when combined with pentylenetetrazole. No significant tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant action of PK 11195 (30 mg kg-1) even after 25 days of dosing daily. In contrast, there was rapid tolerance (within 5 days) to the proconvulsant action of PK 11195 (60 mg kg-1) with picrotoxin (3 mg kg-1). There was no cross-tolerance between the anticonvulsant actions of diazepam and PK 11195, which suggests that these two drugs act at different sites, as would be predicted from the results of the binding studies. The possible sites of action and clinical relevance of these effects are discussed.", 
    "43": "A series of tetrazole convulsants were examined for their potencies in displacing [35S]-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) from the picrotoxin site on the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride ionophore receptor complex. All of the tetrazole derivatives tested inhibited [35S]-TBPS binding from rat forebrain membranes, and except for one (undecamethylenetetrazole), had Hill coefficients near unity. Similar to other chemically unrelated convulsants the inhibition of [35S]-TBPS binding by the various tetrazole derivatives was unaffected by the addition of the bicucculine-like GABA antagonist, R 5135. To ascertain whether the inhibition of specific [35S]-TBPS binding by the tetrazole derivatives was related to their convulsant properties, we compared their in vitro potencies in displacing [35S]-TBPS binding with their minimum convulsant potencies in mice. A very good correlation was observed (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001) between their relative affinities for the [35S]-TBPS binding site and their convulsant potencies, indicating that pentamethylenetetrazol and related tetrazoles may produce their convulsant and anxiogenic actions via the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ionophore receptor complex.", 
    "44": "The synaptic receptor sites for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can be assayed in vitro with several radiolabeled agonists and one antagonist. Numerous criteria of specificity have been met for these binding sites. All of the ligands show heterogeneity in binding affinities. The subpopulations thus defined have a remarkably similar specificity for GABA analogs, which suggests an intimate relationship and possible interconvertibility. Modulation of GABA receptor binding by barbiturates, anions, and other membrane treatments that affect agonists and antagonists in an opposite manner suggests a three-state model of interconvertible affinities. The complex of GABA receptor and chloride ion channel contains modulatory sites for barbiturates and benzodiazepines, drugs that enhance GABA responses in neurons. The receptor complex can be solubilized in detergent with the three mutually interacting receptor activities intact. The complex has an apparent molecular weight of 355,000 and has been partially purified. GABA agonist function has been assayed at the biochemical level by measuring the activation of 36Cl- efflux from preloaded hippocampal slices by GABA, muscimol, and barbiturates. This response is blocked by the antagonists of the GABA site (bicuculline) and the barbiturate site (picrotoxin). Comparison of binding and function on the same tissue should be useful in analyzing the mechanism of action of GABA.", 
    "45": "The pharmacological actions of the benzodiazepines (BZs) are thought to be mediated through specific receptor sites in the mammalian central nervous system. Characterization of these receptor sites in the brain has yielded evidence for heterogeneity of BZ receptor sites. Current theories on the molecular basis of the apparent BZ receptor heterogeneity and the possible functional significance of BZ receptor subtypes are presented. Studies of BZ receptor heterogeneity have provided insights into the molecular events that may be responsible for BZ modulation of gamma-aminobutyric-ergic function.", 
    "46": "The binding of the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872 to central benzodiazepine receptors identified with [3H]Ro 15-1788 was studied in extensively washed homogenates of rat spinal cord and cerebral cortex. CL 218,872 displacement curves were shallow in both spinal cord (nH = 0.67) and cortex (nH = 0.54), suggesting the presence of type 1 and type 2 benzodiazepine receptors in both tissues. CL 218,872 had lower affinity in spinal cord (IC50 = 825 nM) than cortex (IC50 = 152 nM), possibly reflecting the presence of fewer type 1 sites in the cord. Activating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors with 10 microM muscimol resulted in a two- to threefold increase in CL 218,872 affinity in both tissues without changes in the displacement curve slope. This indicates that GABA enhances CL 218,872 affinity for both type 1 and type 2 sites in both spinal cord and cerebral cortex.", 
    "47": "Benzodiazepine receptors were investigated in a cell line of human pituitary cells (18-54,SF) grown in serum-free medium. Preparations of 18-54,SF whole cells and cell membranes were shown to possess saturable [3H]diazepam binding sites. Membrane sites were found to have a KD of 20 nM for diazepam while whole cells possessed a twofold higher value. The KD values determined from Rosenthal, Hill, and kinetic analyses were consistent for each preparation. Whole-cell binding of [3H]diazepam was observed to be more stable than binding to membranes at higher temperatures (37 degrees C) and when longer incubation times (60 min) were employed at 4 degrees C. The rank order potency of various benzodiazepines to inhibit [3H]diazepam binding to whole cells and membranes was Ro 5-4864, flunitrazepam, diazepam, and clonazepam. Representatives of other drug classes did not inhibit this benzodiazepine binding. When 18-54,SF cells were grown for 24 h with 100 nM diazepam and then extensively washed membranes prepared, the KD for diazepam increased to 38 nM whereas the Bmax was unchanged when compared with untreated controls. Overall, these findings indicate that pituitary cells possess a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and that the whole cell receptor differs quantitatively when compared with the membrane receptor.", 
    "48": "Serotonin S2, benzodiazepine, and muscarinic receptors showed different regional distributions in the human brain but were present in all cortical areas. The laminar distributions of [3H]ketanserin, [3H]diazepam, and [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate were investigated in the temporal cortex and revealed a high density in the IIIrd and IVth layers. Dopamine D2 receptors were not detected in the cortex.", 
    "49": "The binding of [3H]GABA and [3H]flunitrazepam was performed with synaptic membranes and post-synaptic densities (PSDs) isolated from canine cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Two GABA binding sites were found with cerebral cortex membranes but only one with cerebellar membranes. PSDs isolated from these showed only single binding sites, with cerebellar PSDs exhibiting lower KD values and a larger concentration of sites than did cerebral cortex PSDs. In the case of flunitrazepam, only one binding site was found for all four preparations, with cerebellar PSDs having twice the concentration of sites of cerebral PSDs. Photoaffinity labeling of the flunitrazepam receptor in PSDs resulted in the binding to a 51,000 Mr protein in both cases, with cerebellar PSDs again showing an increased concentration over that found in cerebral cortex PSDs. Based on this work, and on earlier work of ourselves and of others, we conclude that both populations of isolated PSDs contain inhibitory sites, but that the intact PSDs in both preparations are derived from Gray type I, probably excitatory, synapses, and that the inhibitory sites are found in the broken-up material in the PSD fractions which are derived from Gray type II, probably inhibitory, synapses.", 
    "50": "A general method for the trace analysis of benzodiazepine drugs and their major metabolites at single dose therapeutic levels in 0.2 ml blood samples is described. The method involves solvent extraction of blood with toluene, isolation of the analytes using deactivated Amberlite XAD-7 porous polymer beads, and analysis of the cleaned-up extracts by capillary column gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. The clean-up technique eliminates lipids and other interfering material, enabling routine analysis of blood extracts to be carried out with no significant deterioration in column or detector performance over a period of many months. The use of fused-silica capillary columns coated with SE-52 and the correct choice of chromatographic conditions permits underivatised benzodiazepines of widely differing volatilities and polarites to be analysed. Data for 26 benzodiazepines and metabolites are presented.", 
    "51": "Extracellular action potentials were recorded from cerebellar Purkinje cells in urethane-anaesthetised rats. Synaptic inhibition was evoked by electrical stimulation of the nearby cortical surface and recorded using peristimulus-time histograms. A benzodiazepine agonist, RU 32007, decreased cell firing rate and increased the inhibitory response duration in parallel. beta-Carboline ethyl ester increased firing and decreased the inhibitory response. In some cases the inhibitory response was abolished, independent of the change in firing. CL 218872 decreased firing with the parallel increase in inhibitory response. However, in some cases the inhibitory response was abolished despite decreases in firing. All the effects of all three agents were blocked by Ro 15-1788.", 
    "52": "Brain-specific benzodiazepine receptors are allosterically coupled to chloride ionophore-associated binding sites for sulfur-35-labeled t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate. The specific binding of t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to fresh unwashed rat cortical membranes is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of five benzodiazepine agonists but not by the antagonist Ro 15-1788. Their inhibitory potencies in this assay are closely related to their antimetrazol activities. Studies with solubilized receptor-complex preparations establish an absolute requirement for gamma-aminobutyric acid (3 to 10 microM), strongly suggesting that the antagonism of metrazol-induced seizures by the benzodiazepines involves an action on the chloride ionophore mediated through the low affinity gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor.", 
    "53": "Diazepam-induced feeding in rats is antagonized not only by the opiate antagonist naloxone but also intraventricular administration of specific antisera to the endogenous opioid peptides met-enkephalin or beta-endorphin. Pituitary beta-endorphin is probably not implicated in the diazepam effect since blockade with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone of the release of beta-endorphin from the anterior pituitary does not modify the diazepam-induced feeding, which is however prevented by TRH, a suggested physiological antagonist of some of the effects of opioid peptides. The possible central participation of both beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin in the ingestive behavior induced by diazepam gives further support to the postulated physiological role of endogenous opioids in appetite regulation.", 
    "54": "Oxprenolol, a fat-soluble beta-adrenergic blocker, promoted as an anxiolytic agent to alleviate peripheral symptoms associated with anxiety, and lorazepam, a 1,4-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, may both depress central nervous system (CNS) function. It is generally accepted that ethanol, when concurrently ingested, potentiates the CNS-depressant effects of drugs. The effects on CNS function of oxprenolol, lorazepam and placebo alone and in combination with ethanol were determined by a Leeds Psychomotor Tester and we concluded that oxprenolol in combination with ethanol is less hazardous to people operating power tools/machines or driving motor vehicles than the combination of lorazepam with ethanol.", 
    "55": "A reflex increase in arterial blood pressure and heart rate was elicited by application of epicardial bradykinin (4 X 10(-8), 2 X 10(-7), 10(-6) g/ml) in pentobarbital-anaesthetized, thoracotomized rats. The influence of the opioid fentanyl and the tranquilizer diazepam on this increase was then investigated. When fentanyl (2.2 micrograms/(kg X min] was infused i.v. during periods of bradykinin application, a highly significant suppression of the excitatory reflex resulted. Epicardial bradykinin (10(-6) g/ml) induced an increase in mean arterial blood pressure of 25.3 +/- 3.5 mm Hg during the control period and of 6.8 +/- 1.4 mm Hg during fentanyl infusion. The corresponding changes in heart rate were +20.8 +/- 4.7 beats/min during the control period and +1.9 +/- 1.3 beats/min during fentanyl infusion. When cardioacceleration was induced by the carotid occlusion reflex, fentanyl antagonized this effect too. The effect of fentanyl was entirely neutralized by injecting naloxone (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) prior to application of the former. Diazepam had no influence on the bradykinin-induced reflex. The results support the view that morphinoceptors may modulate the excitatory cardiac reflex induced by epicardial application of the algesic bradykinin in the rat.", 
    "56": "The actions of diazepam and its p-chloro-derivative Ro 5-4864 were compared on mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion neurons in cell culture. Diazepam enhanced but Ro 5-4864 reduced iontophoretic GABA responses in a concentration-dependent manner. Both diazepam and Ro 5-4864 limited sustained, high frequency repetitive firing of spinal cord neurons but diazepam was more potent. Ro 5-4864 was, however, more potent than diazepam in inhibiting spontaneous neuronal activity of spinal cord neurons and reducing the duration of calcium-dependent action potentials of dorsal root ganglion neurons. The differing actions of diazepam and Ro 5-4864 may account for the contrasting pharmacological spectra of the two benzodiazepines.", 
    "57": "The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) is anxiogenic in the social interaction test. Acute administration of chlordiazepoxide (5 or 10 mg/kg) did not reverse the anxiogenic effects of Ro 15-1788; however, in animals pretreated with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) for 5 days prior to testing, there was a reduction in the anxiety produced by Ro 15-1788.", 
    "58": "[3H]PK 11195 binding to peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites in kidney membranes is inhibited by the histidine blocking agent diethylpyrocarbonate. This reagent irreversibly decreases the Bmax for [3H]PK 11195 without affecting the affinity. By contrast binding of [3H]RO5-4864 is not affected by diethylpyrocarbonate treatment. However RO5-4864 can protect in a concentration dependent manner the [3H]PK 11195 binding site from diethylpyrocarbonate whereas clonazepam and RO15-1788 are not active. These results suggest that PK 11195 and RO5-4864 interact with different conformational states of the receptors that RO5-4864. This is in agreement with our previous hypothesis that PK 11195 is an antagonist and RO5-4864 an agonist at the \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "59": "Neurotoxic esterase (NTE) has been proposed to be the initiation site of organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN). There are two apparent problems associated with this hypothesis: NTE activity in the brain returns to nearly normal levels before the onset of the neuropathy, and NTE is present in and inhibited by organophosphorus compounds in young animals and other species which are relatively insensitive to the neurotoxic effects of these compounds. This paper presents data suggesting that differences in the recovery rates of NTE activity may account for some of these discrepancies. First, the onset of recovery of NTE activity following sc administration of 1.7 mg/kg of O,O-diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) in the hen sciatic nerve occurred several days later than in the brain. Furthermore, recovery was slower in distal than proximal parts of the nerve. This information indicates that NTE activity is depressed for a longer period at the site of the neuropathy than it would appear from the measurement of NTE activity in brain. Second, the rate of recovery of NTE activity was faster in the brains of chicks, of rats, and of hens treated with a daily po dose of 15 mg/kg cortisone acetate than it was in untreated hens. However, there was no significant increase in the NTE recovery rate in the peripheral nerves of the chicks or the cortisone-treated hens. Thus, it appears that although slower distal recovery could account for the greater sensitivity of longer axons to OPIDN, other factors are operating in chicks and cortisone-treated hens.", 
    "60": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of bromazepam in plasma and of its main metabolites in urine is described. The unchanged drug is extracted from plasma with dichloromethane, using Extrelut 1 extraction tubes. The residue from this extract is subsequently analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (230 nm). The limit of detection is 6 ng/ml of plasma, using a 1-ml specimen. For the determination of the metabolites, the urine samples are incubated to effect enzymatic deconjugation and are then extracted with dichloromethane. Following two clean-up steps (back extractions), the final residue is analysed on the same reversed-phase system as the plasma samples. The limit of detection for the two metabolites is 200 ng/ml.", 
    "61": "Low concentrations of avermectin B1a (AVM) stimulated the specific high affinity binding of [35S]tert.-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPT) to membranes from rat cerebral cortex in the absence or presence of chloride or bromide ions. In contrast, TBPT either weakly stimulaes or does not significantly influence the specific high affinity binding of [3H]AVM to the same membranes in the absence or presence of chloride ions, respectively. These results indicate that [3H]AVM and [35S]TBPT bind to different but closely associated binding sites.", 
    "62": "The actions on [3H]noradrenaline release of chlordiazepoxide and FG 7142 were investigated in rat hippocampal synaptosomes. The release evoked by GABA, an action mediated by GABAA receptors, was enhanced by chlordiazepoxide and depressed by FG 7142. K+-evoked release, however, was depressed by both chlordiazepoxide and FG 7142 and occurred in the absence of GABA. The actions on both GABA-evoked and K+-evoked release were blocked by Ro 15-1788. The results suggest that the distinction between agonist and inverse agonist applies to the GABA-dependent but not to the GABA-independent action of benzodiazepines.", 
    "63": "The phenylquinoline, PK 8165 (5-25 mg/kg), produced dose-related reductions in locomotor activity, rearing and exploratory head-dipping in a holeboard. Neither Ro 15-1788 (1, 10 or 20 mg/kg) nor CGS 8216 (1 or 10 mg/kg) was able to reverse the reductions in locomotor activity or rearing. This suggests that at least some of the behavioural effects of PK 8165 are not mediated by a site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. This conclusion is supported by the recent report [9] that, whereas PK 8165 potently displaces benzodiazepines from their binding site in vitro, it is without effect in vivo.", 
    "64": "Pharmacologically relevant concentrations of benzodiazepines have previously been reported to increase 45Ca2+ uptake into synaptosomes. This observation, coupled with the recent report that nifedipine may block the hypnotic effect of flurazepam, led us to study the effects of nifedipine and nitrendipine on 45Ca2+ uptake into synaptosomes. Diazepam (1 microM) significantly increased the uptake of 45Ca2+ to a crude synaptosomal fraction (P2) prepared from rat cerebral cortex and depolarized with 55 mM K+. Nifedipine (1 microM) did not alter the uptake of Ca2+, while nitrendipine (1 microM) reduced uptake by 37%. Both nifedipine and nitrendipine completely antagonized the ability of diazepam to increase 45Ca2+ uptake following K+ depolarization. These observations support the notion that the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines may be mediated through effects on a calcium channel.", 
    "65": "Some behavioural effects of flunitrazepam were investigated in two sets of experiments in C57BL/6 mice. In the first set, flunitrazepam administration (0.025 or 0.05 mg/kg) enhanced the locomotor activity of mice. In the second set, memory impairments were observed following posttraining (immediately or 30 min, but not 60 min) treatment with the drug (0.05 mg/kg). All effects were antagonized by a per se ineffective dose of naltrexone (0.5 mg/kg for the activity, 0.1 mg/kg for the memory experiments), suggesting the involvement of opioid receptors. The results are discussed on the basis of recent evidence suggesting a link between benzodiazepine and opiate mechanisms of action.", 
    "66": "To determine whether the convulsive action of intraventricularly injected dopamine sulfate, a dopamine metabolite present in rat brain and human cerebrospinal fluid, could be due to its interaction with GABAergic pathway, we compared the convulsive effect of dopamine sulfate with that of bicuculline in the conscious rat and determined the interaction of dopamine sulfate with [3H] GABA binding and uptake in rat brain tissues. The results showed that the convulsive effects of dopamine sulfate and of bicuculline could be abolished by GABA agonists diazepam and muscimol, but not by DA antagonists haloperidol and metoclopramide. In addition they were additive. Both dopamine 3-O-sulfate and dopamine-4-O-sulfate, like bicuculline, could displace sodium-independent [3H] GABA binding to rat brain synaptic membranes (IC50 = 400 microM) but had no action on GABA uptake. DA sulfate had no effect on [3H] strychnine binding to rat brain homogenates. This evidence together with the structural resemblance between dopamine sulfate and GABA suggested that the convulsive activity of dopamine sulfate may result from its interaction with central GABA receptors.", 
    "67": "In dogs the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam was followed by weekly determinations of the convulsive threshold for pentetrazole, 10-15 min after intravenous (i.v.) injection of 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg diazepam. As soon as after 1 week of oral treatment with diazepam, 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg three times daily (t.i.d.), the pentetrazole threshold showed a decline or even a fall to the control level in spite of unaltered or rising concentrations of diazepam and its active metabolites. Tolerance also developed when the dogs were treated with chlorazepate, 2 mg/kg t.i.d., between the weekly diazepam injections for threshold determination. The results favor a functional type of tolerance since there was no indication of a more rapid inactivation of diazepam. Treatment with desmethyldiazepam (2 mg/kg i.v. for threshold determination and oral treatment with the desmethyldiazepam precursor chlorazepate, 2 mg/kg t.i.d.) did not produce tolerance. In further experiments in dogs anesthetized, relaxed with suxamethonium and ventilated, a spike-wave activity in the EEG was induced and maintained by an injection and subsequent infusion of pentetrazole. Out of 6 dogs, receiving 4-5 i.v. injections of 0.25-0.5 mg/kg diazepam, 2 showed the phenomenon of acute tolerance, i.e. the effect of the drug on the spiking activity in the EEG became less from one injection to the next, and thus paralleled a situation which may be observed during treatment of clinical status epilepticus. No acute tolerance was observed in corresponding experiments with desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "68": "The action of suriclone (R.P. 31,264), a new non-benzodiazepine compound of the cyclopyrrolone family with clinical anxiolytic activity was examined using biochemical and electrophysiological models supposed to be capable of revealing central GABAergic activity. Suriclone, which does not act directly on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (muscimol binding assay), markedly reduced the increase of striatal HVA level induced in the rat by a neuroleptic and decreased the cerebellar vermis cGMP content. Moreover, in the cat, suriclone was able to enhance dorsal root potential amplitude which reflects an increase of the presynaptic inhibition. In view of these results, a central GABAergic mechanism of action may be proposed for suriclone.", 
    "69": "A new in vivo procedure suitable for testing the smooth muscle relaxant properties of a test substance is described. Topical eserine produced a long-lasting steady increase in tone of guinea pig distal colon and enhanced the atropine-sensitive phasic activity. Intravenously administered atropine, pirenzepine, and dicyclomine (which possess competitive antimuscarinic properties) produced a dose-related inhibition of eserine-induced muscle tone and suppressed phasic contractions. On the other hand, verapamil and octylonium bromide (which produce smooth muscle relaxation by interfering with Ca++ availability for contraction) did not suppress phasic contraction although they were fully effective in inhibiting eserine-induced tone. The eserine-induced contraction of guinea pig distal colon appears to be a suitable, quick, and inexpensive test for evaluating the effects of potential smooth muscle relaxants against background hypermotility produced by amplifying the neurogenic drive to the target organ.", 
    "70": "Muscarinic receptor densities were measured in membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex using [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. Isotherms of equilibrium binding data modeled to a single apparent binding site for both ligands. However, as has been reported previously, [3H]pirenzepine labeled only a small fraction of the binding sites that were labeled by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. This observation has been used to support the hypothesis that subtypes of muscarinic receptors exist. Several investigators have previously suggested that antagonist binding to muscarinic receptors involves an isomerization of the receptor-antagonist complex, and it is only the isomerized form of the receptor that is identified by radioligand binding studies. To examine the possibility that the difference in the density of binding sites identified by [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate is due to differences in the degree of isomerization of the receptor associated with the binding of each ligand, the kinetics of the binding of [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex were examined. The pseudo-first-order rate constant of association for both ligands showed a nonlinear (hyperbolic) dependence on ligand concentration. These results suggested that a rapidly equilibrating initial binding step was followed by a more slowly equilibrating isomerization of the initially formed ligand-receptor complex. The kinetic data were computer-modeled to obtain estimates of the equilibrium constants for both reaction steps. The equilibrium constants for the isomerization step were 0.1 and 0.004 for [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, respectively. Our measurements, in agreement with others, suggested that only the fraction of receptors which isomerized were measurable using filtration binding assays. Although essentially all (99.6%) of the [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites appeared to isomerize, only 90% of the [3H]pirenzepine binding sites isomerized, and thus only 90% were measured in our assay. It therefore appears that differences in receptor isomerization can partially, but not wholly, account for the differences between [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding in rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "71": "Two preparations of diazepam, Valium Roche mixed Micelles and Diazemuls, were compared as intravenous premedicants in 119 patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. There were no differences between the formulations with regard to anxiolytic effects and systemic tolerance. There were no symptoms typical of thrombophlebitis in the Valium Roche Mixed-Micelles group and only one case in the Diazemuls group. Acute local tolerance was similar with both trial drugs and superior to conventional diazepam preparations. Based on the favourable results of the present study it can be concluded that such vehicles should be considered for any injectable preparation with a known tendency to produce venous irritation.", 
    "72": "The hypothetical involvement of central noradrenergic projections in the manifestation of \"anxiety\" and the \"anti-anxiety\" effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines was tested in an operant conflict situation by examining the effects of destruction of this noradrenergic system on response rates. Rats were trained on a Geller-Seifter conflict test [9] modified for incremental shock [21], in which two food-reinforced lever press components were separated by a time-out. Responses during the \"food-alone\" component (RI) were reinforced on a random interval schedule-30 sec; responses during the \"time-out\" component were never reinforced; and responses during the conflict component (CONFLICT) were continuously reinforced with both food and shock. This shock strength increased incrementally with each successive shock during the conflict period. Each session consisted of two cycles of a 5 min RI period, a two min time out, and a two min CONFLICT period presented in succession. Both ethanol (0.5 to 1.0 g/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (5 and 10 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in punished responding during the CONFLICT component. Ethanol, but not chlordiazepoxide (CDP) also significantly decreased responding during the RI component. Virtual total destruction of the dorsal noradrenergic projection with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or destruction of the locus coeruleus itself, failed to significantly alter baseline responding or the release of punished responding to ethanol or CDP. These results do not support the hypothesis that the locus coeruleus projections have an essential role in \"anxiety\" or in the \"anxiety-reducing\" properties of ethanol or the benzodiazepines.", 
    "73": "Rats placed as intruders in a long-established colony showed significant elevations of plasma corticosterone after 10-20 minutes of intruding. This rise was prevented by 5 days pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). The rats resident in the colony had significantly higher basal corticosterone concentrations compared with singly housed rats but the same as rats housed in groups of six in a normal cage. The resident rats showed no elevation of plasma corticosterone in response to 20 minutes of an intruder in the colony.", 
    "74": "In unstressed rats, morphine, pentobarbital, diazepam and alprazolam were without effect on plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels. Amphetamine increased the levels of both catecholamines. In stressed rats, morphine did not affect the stress-induced increases in NE and E. Amphetamine enhanced the catecholamine stress-response further. Diazepam reduced stress-induced increases of NE levels. Pentobarbital and alprazolam attenuated stress-induced increases of both NE and E levels; this effect was particularly marked with alprazolam.", 
    "75": "Diazepam in propylene glycol (Valium, Roche) and midazolam (Hypnovel, Roche) were compared as sedatives in 40 patients undergoing minor oral surgery. Twenty patients received each drug. The cardiovascular effects, the acceptability of the drugs to patients and dentists and the incidence of anterograde amnesia and adverse venous sequelae were investigated. Serum benzodiazepine levels were measured and recovery studied by six psychomotor tests repeated over five hours. Both drugs provided safe and acceptable sedation. More amnesia was reported in the midazolam group and more adverse venous sequelae by the diazepam patients. The recovery tests showed that the time taken to return to pre-sedation scores varied with the tests used and there was no significant evidence of the midazolam group recovering more quickly. In particular, significant impairment of delayed memory recall persisted in both groups throughout the investigation period.", 
    "76": "Exposure to diazepam during the prenatal or early postnatal developmental period has been reported to result in later behavioural deficits. In the present study morphological changes in the brains of rats that were exposed to diazepam (DZP) prenatally or through the mother's milk postnatally were investigated. The results showed that prolonged prenatal exposure (16 days) to diazepam (10 mg/kg) resulted in characteristic and extensive pathological changes, i.e. gliosis and perivascular cuffing in the brains of the rats. These changes could be observed under the light microscope a long time after exposure to the drug had been terminated. Limiting the prenatal exposure to a single trimester of 7 days reduced somewhat the number of lesions but did not prevent their occurrence. Rats exposed to diazepam postnatally through the mothers' milk showed very few lesions."
