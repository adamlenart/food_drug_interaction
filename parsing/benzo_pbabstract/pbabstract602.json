    "0": "The effects of neuroleptics (droperidol and diazepam) were studied on the neural excitation by ketamine hydrochloride by means of the c-fiber reflex, in the spinal cat and the intact cat. Results can be summarized as follows: 1) Ketamine hydrochloride 125-500 micrograms/Kg i.v. facilitated the neural activity on the c-fiber reflex of the intact cat, but it depressed that of the spinal cat. 2) Droperidol 50-250 micrograms/Kg i.v. and diazepam 50-250 micrograms/Kg i.v. did not influence the neural activity on the c-fiber reflex of the intact cat, but it depressed that of the spinal cat. 3) Droperidol 125 micrograms/Kg i.v. followed by ketamine hydrochloride 125 micrograms/Kg i.v. facilitated the neural activity of the intact cat c-fiber reflex. 4) Diazepam 50 micrograms/Kg i.v. followed by ketamine hydrochloride 250 micrograms/Kg i.v. did not influence the neural activity of the intact cat c-fiber reflex. These data suggested that the neural excitation of ketamine hydrochloride was depressed by diazepam and that a small dose of droperidol did not depress the neural excitation of the intact cat.", 
    "1": "Chlordiazepoxide, a tranquilizing (anxiolytic) agent, is compared with phenobarbitone, a sedative with some anxiolytic properties, in a behavioural drug classification test. It is shown that in the case of chlordiazepoxide there is a marked inhibition of stimulus analysis but little effect upon motor activity; phenobarbitone produces some suppression of stimulus processing but has an even more marked suppressant effect on motor activity. However, phenobarbitone is also found to affect memory formation and when corrections are applied to the data to take account of this factor, the classification profile of phenobarbitone is greatly modified. The findings are discussed in the light of a model of affective disorders and psychoactive drug action based on dysfunctioning of stimulus analysis mechanisms.", 
    "2": "The effect of the benzodiazepine, diazepam, administered for 7 days in doses between 1.25 and 5 mg kg-1 was studied on the turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in rat cerebral cortex. 5-HT turnover was assessed by calculating the ratio of the concentration of the major metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) to that of 5-HT (i.e., 5-HIAA:5-HT). Diazepam (2.5 and 5 mg kg-1 i.p. daily for 7 days) significantly reduced cerebral cortical 5-HT turnover. The effect of manipulating cerebral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mechanisms on this action of diazepam was studied. Treatment of animals with a subconvulsive dose of picrotoxin (3 mg kg-1 i.p.) reversed the fall in cortical 5-HT turnover seen following diazepam. In contrast, however, treatment with the GABA transaminase inhibitors, amino-oxyacetic acid (25 mg kg-1) or ethanolamine-O-sulphate (250 mg kg-1, 7 days) which elevated cerebral GABA concentrations, enhanced the reduction in cortical 5-HT turnover following diazepam. Focal injection of picrotoxin (0.1 micrograms) into the region of the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus reversed the decrease in cortical 5-HT turnover caused by diazepam. The hypothesis that doses of diazepam which result in total plasma concentrations comparable to those observed in man produce a reduction in 5-HT turnover mediated via GABA neurones is discussed.", 
    "3": "New rat model of stress ulcer, related to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was devised. A 0.2 ml of the arterial blood, obtained from another rat of the same litter, was injected into the cisterna magna and 4 days later, mild stress, consisting of restraint plus water-immersion for 3 hours to the injected rat, produced gastric ulcers. These lesions were far more marked than in usual rats undergoing the same stress (P less than 0.001). Using this \"SAH-stress model\", effects of various counteracting measures were examined. Based on the results, we concluded that SAH produced a hypersensitivity or an abnormal excitability of the autonomic nervous centers, and the relatively mild stress effectively weakened the gastric defensive factors and strengthened the gastric aggressive factors, thus resulting in ulcer formation.", 
    "4": "The effects of drugs modifying GABAergic neurotransmission have been examined on ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves induced in the enc\u00e9phale isol\u00e9 cat by reserpine (PGOres), Ro4-1284 (PGO1284) or PCPA (PGOPCPA). The GABA agonists muscimol and THIP both caused large increases in density of PGOPCPA. The PGO1284 and PGOres were less affected although, of these, a larger increase in PGO1284 density was recorded. None of the increases could be reversed by subsequent injection of bicuculline. Chlordiazepoxide brought about large increases in PGOPCPA density but was ineffective in altering PGOres or PGO1284. The GABA transaminase inhibitor gamma-acetylenic GABA increased the density of all PGO waves but was not effective in the case of PGOPCPA. These results confirm a role for GABA in modulating PGO activity. The pathways involved in this GABA modulation are discussed.", 
    "5": "In connection with operations on the lower extremities, in the perineum, for vascular surgery, for labour (cesarean section) and for abdominal surgery more than 800 patients were given lumbar epidural anesthesia with plain bupivacaine 0.5% and 100 patients with 0.75% bupivacaine without adrenaline. In one case we observed the dramatic complication of a cerebral convulsion following an epidural analgesia with bupivacaine 0.75% (total dose of 127.5 mg). The convulsion, which occurred to a female patient, can be attributed to possible intravascular injection in correlation with the high concentration of the local analgesic and its fast resorption. This specific complication was treated with 10 mg diazepam which was repeatedly injected intravascular in small doses. Moreover the patient was intubated for a short time and ventilated with pure oxygen in order to avoid a hypoxia of the brain.", 
    "6": "Psychotherapeutic endeavors of individuals in the context of a graduated overall psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological strategy often fail to result in successful treatment because insufficient attention is paid to the biologically variable dimension of disturbed psychophysical integrity. The significance of intermediate pathogenetic stages in multistratified \"neurotic\" depressions and in anorexia nervosa and compulsive syndromes are dealt with in detail. Irrespective of the primary psychodynamics, neurobiologically modulated condition pictures with unusual autonomous dynamics can determine the picture. The same psychotherapy and somatotherapy does not entail the same action when carried out on a psychopathological substrate with different presentation and at different times. Finally, the possible transition from the psychosomatic clinical picture to \"compensated\" benzodiazepine-dependence is referred to. These secondary diseases exemplify iatrogenically modified psychopathological progress forms.", 
    "7": "The pharmacokinetics, distribution, plasma protein binding and the biliary excretion of pinazepam were studied in the rat. The drug was administered (5 mg/kg) by i.p. injection. The chemical analysis of pinazepam and its metabolites was carried out by a gas-chromatographic method. The parent compound was rapidly absorbed, accumulated into the tissues and converted into N-desmethyldiazepam. The highest plasma levels of the parent compound (367 +/- 13 ng/ml) were found 3 min after administration. The volume of distribution and the clearance of the drug were 1315 ml and 7.23 ml/min respectively. The metabolite was detected in the plasma and tissues 3 min after administration. At this sampling time its concentrations were 76 +/- 16 ng/ml in the plasma and 1081 +/- 68 ng/g in the liver. The decay curve of both pinazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam in the plasma, liver, lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gastrochemius muscle were characterized for their Kel, t 1/2, and AUC values. The tissue AUC to plasma AUC ratios indicated a preferential accumulation of pinazepam over its metabolite in the tissues. The plasma protein binding of pinazepam was measured by dialysis at the equilibrium. Rat plasma proteins bound 89.17 +/- 0.20 percent of the drug. The association constant was 2.60 X 10(3) l/mole and the number of sites 0.44 X 10(-6) sites/g. The biliary excretion of pinazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam was poor.", 
    "8": "This paper presents a series of 20 epileptic patients operated on at our Institute, with a clinical, EEG and drug plasma level follow-up, for periods from 48 to 60 months. Following surgery a group of 12 patients were seizure-free in a 3 year period of follow-up, and anticonvulsant medication was gradually withdrawn. While in 8 of these patients drug interruption uneventful, in 4 cases drug withdrawal caused the seizure to reappear. These 4 patients became seizure-free again, following a reintroduction of pharmacological therapy, which appeared to be effective also at low doses. Another group of 8 patients continued to have seizure also after surgery. Following quantitative and qualitative adjustments of their anticonvulsant medication, 5 patients became again seizure-free, while 3 continued to have seizures. Our experience suggests that in patients in whom the epileptogenic lesions have been surgically removed, anticonvulsant therapy can be safely withdrawn and removed after a seizure-free period of 3 years. Reappearance of seizures after drug withdrawal has a good prognosis, since a simple readjustment of medical therapy is usually effective in preventing further seizures to occur.", 
    "9": "The potential \"anxiogenic\" effects of convulsant benzodiazepine and GABA-antagonist, Ro 5-3663 and specific antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors, Ro 15-1788 were compared in the Geller-Seifter conflict paradigm. Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (5 mg/kg) was used as a \"positive\" control. Both Ro 5-3663 (1 mg/kg) and Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) antagonized the anticonflict effect of CDP. However, while Ro 15-1788 had a modest anticonflict potency. Ro 5-3663 had an anxiogenic effect in its own right.", 
    "10": "Dextropropoxyphene is a widely prescribed synthetic opiate-like drug of uncertain analgesic efficacy which, in acute overdosage, manifests all the features of opiate toxicity. It is rapidly absorbed and, in association with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepine drugs, may be rapidly fatal. Seriously overdosed patients are comatose with respiratory depression, vomiting, seizures and circulatory collapse; small pupils are a useful diagnostic marker. The first priority is to establish the airway and treat convulsions, if present. All the features of overdosage are then rapidly and safely reversed by the specific opiate antagonist naloxone given intravenously. High tissue concentrations and slow elimination of dextropropoxyphene metabolites make continued and intensive monitoring after resuscitation essential because sudden unpredictable deterioration may occur for up to 24 hours. Other more slowly toxic co-ingestants such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are often present and should be detected and treated as necessary. Dextropropoxyphene poisoning is now probably one of the most common causes of self-poisoning death because, although there is an effective antidote, subjects frequently succumb before treatment can be made available.", 
    "11": "Findings obtained using a one-trial modification of exploration procedure are reviewed and the suitability of the test as a device for screening and classifying psychoactive drugs is considered. It is concluded that the test has value from a theoretical point of view, in relation to a model of affective disorders based upon the concept of stimulus analysis, but that there are several practical difficulties which limit the test's usefulness as an adjunct to a basic screening programme for new drugs.", 
    "12": "Ligand bound to detergent-solubilized or cytosolic receptors can be separated from free ligand by filtration through glass-fiber filters which have been pretreated with polyethylenimine (PEI). Receptors which can be assayed by this technique include detergent-solubilized muscarinic, adenosine A1, alpha 1-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, dopamine D2, opiate, bradykinin, and benzodiazepine receptors as well as naturally soluble estradiol receptors. For muscarinic, adenosine, alpha 2, dopamine, and estradiol receptors, specific binding measured by the PEI-filter technique was 84-110% of specific binding measured by gel filtration, demonstrating that the technique gave almost quantitative recovery of bound ligand.", 
    "13": "The effects of GABA agonists on [3H] flunitrazepam binding were examined in membranes from CNS areas proposed to contain different populations of benzodiazepine binding site subtypes (BZ1/BZ2). Since these effects were broadly similar in both cerebellar and hippocampal membranes, it seems unlikely that GABA receptors interacting with the proposed BZ1/BZ2 binding sites have markedly different properties. Sodium chloride clearly facilitated the potentiating effect of muscimol on [3H] flunitrazepam binding but produced a complex interaction with the effects of GABA itself and the partial agonist imidazoleacetic acid in the phosphate buffer system used.", 
    "14": "The interaction of benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines with metal cations was investigated. Among numerous transition metal cations, only three, CO2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+, specifically inhibited the binding of [3H]beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester (beta-CCE). The effects of these cations on [3H]beta-CCE binding were exactly opposite to those on [3H]diazepam binding. The effects of these cations was not dependent on lipid peroxidation. The differential effect of these cations may reflect a general difference in the way agonists and antagonists bind to the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "15": "The hydrodynamic behaviour of benzodiazepine receptors solubilized by deoxycholate from calf cerebral cortex reveals two molecular forms. The Stokes radii are 46.5 A and 67.2 A, and the sedimentation coefficients are 10.9 S and 14.6 S. The calculated apparent molecular weights and frictional ratios suggest either two nearly globular proteins of ca. 200K and 400K daltons each, or two ca. 300K daltons proteins which differ significantly in their degree of asymmetry. The benzodiazepine binding site is located on ca. 51K daltons component(s) in both forms.", 
    "16": "An original one-stage method for isolating from brain tissue of a water-soluble fraction containing an inhibitor of benzodiazepine specific binding is suggested and the properties of the inhibitor are described. The inhibitor is a thermostable compound with a molecular mass of 2000-10000 dalton. It inhibits diazepam binding depending on the concentration. The IC50 for diazepam binding is approximately ten-fold less than the inhibitor concentration in the brain tissue. The inhibitor is distributed heterogeneously in the rat brain (the maximal content in the cerebellum and cortex) and bovine brain (the maximal content in the thalamus and caudate nucleus).", 
    "17": "A study was made of the effect of a two-week administration of chlorimipramine, zimelidine and a morpholine derivative on benzodiazepine receptors of the mouse brain. The animals which received antidepressants demonstrated a significant increase in the binding sites of 3H-flunitrazepam without any changes in the dissociation constant as compared to control. The data on the evoked aggressiveness and latency of tonic corasole convulsions in the antidepressant-treated animals support the functional importance of the discovered changes in benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "18": "Repeated kindled seizures result in increased numbers of benzodiazepine receptors in fascia dentata membranes. Our previous work localized these receptors to a discrete neuronal population, the dentate granule cells. The present investigation characterizes the regulation of this binding by NaCl, pentobarbital and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). [3H]Flunitrazepam binding in membranes from kindled rats exceeded that from controls by 24%. NaCl increased this binding in membranes prepared from control and kindled animals by roughly equivalent amounts (18 and 14%, respectively). No significant differences were found in the effects of pentobarbital on benzodiazepine binding between kindled and control groups. In contrast, addition of GABA increased benzodiazepine binding by a significantly smaller percentage in the kindled (116 +/- 5%) compared to the control (138 +/- 11%) group. We propose that this altered molecular response to GABA is intimately related to the enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition of granule cells present after kindled seizures.", 
    "19": "Chronic administration of lithium led to a decreased number of benzodiazepine receptors (ca. 20%) in frontal cortex of rat brain, whereas no change was observed in the binding characteristics in the remaining part of the cortex and in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Long-term lithium treatment did not change the binding of [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to membranes of various brain regions in the rat. We concluded that the effect of lithium on the benzodiazepine receptor is brain region specific and cannot be explained as a consequence of a reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic stimulation of benzodiazepine receptor, as the change in receptor binding was due to a change in the number of receptors rather than in the affinity constant.", 
    "20": "Fifty practitioners treated 224 patients with clobazam for 4 weeks. The anxiolytic action, the tolerability, the degree of satisfaction and the dosage of clobazam were evaluated by means of a modified \"Rating Scale for Anxiety\" by Hamilton and self-evaluation scales. Clobazam proved to have an important anxiolytic activity together with good tolerability. The ability to concentrate was remarkably improved, which seems to confirm the specificity of the molecule (benzodiazepine-1,5). The reduction of anxiety and of anxious equivalents and the good tolerability of the product were confirmed by the judgement of satisfaction of the doctors as well as of their patients.", 
    "21": "The disposition of 14C-loprazolam has been studied in rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey and man using oral and parenteral dosing. In all species 14C was excreted principally in the faeces irrespective of the route of administration. In surgically prepared animals, 46% dose (rat) or 60% (dog) was excreted in bile and, together with urinary excretion, indicates that approx. two-thirds of an oral dose was absorbed. In rat there was relatively little enterohepatic circulation (approximately 26%) compared to dog (approximately 73%). Whole-body autoradiography and tissue-distribution studies in rat showed that 14C was distributed principally in liver and intestine, and was eliminated within 24 h. 14C was found in brain of rat and dog; in dog concn. levels were higher in white matter than in grey matter. In studies using pigmented animals, 14C was associated with the uveal tract of the eye and with other melanin-containing tissues. This was reversible and was eliminated from the eye of rat with a half-life of 3.4 d. Blood and plasma concn. of 14C and of unchanged loprazolam declined relatively rapidly in rat. In dog, cynomolgus monkey and man, total 14C concn. in blood fell more slowly than unchanged loprazolam. Less than 85% of loprazolam was protein bound in rat, dog or human plasma in vitro.", 
    "22": "A nation-wide survey on the abuse of benzodiazepines in Switzerland showed an average morbidity (incidence) of 0.0006 per year for isolated abuse of benzodiazepines. The exposure risk was, independently of the benzodiazepine compound used. 0.00002 per prescription. The afflicted population differed demographically in no way from the population of \"normal\" benzodiazepine consumers, legitimate therapeutic use of a benzodiazepine being the only visible risk factor for development of an abuse. The motivation for abuse, too, was in about 90% of the case self-medication of anxiety and/or insomnia and related symptomatology. Main source of the drug was new prescriptions by the treating physician. The majority of patients were medically in a good state of health and socially well adjusted; 52 out of 180 patients, however, showed negative consequences. Withdrawal syndromes were reported in about one quarter of the detected cases, but detection was mostly due to the increased frequency of prescriptions of confession of the patient. Because of the low frequency of severe negative consequences and the mostly unobtrusive behaviour of the patients, differing in many ways from the accustomed picture of an \"abuser of (illicit) drugs\", the physician's attitude towards abuse of benzodiazepines was in many cases ambivalent, resulting in a tacit acquiescence and continued prescription. From the data presented it is concluded that the most appropriate measure against abuse of benzodiazepines would be, rather than international control, education of medical professionals and the public, according to internationally accepted medical knowledge and to national law and prescription regulations.", 
    "23": "Two groups of rats were trained to discriminate either IP buspirone from vehicle or IP oxazepam from vehicle using a two-lever FR-10 schedule of sweetened milk presentation. The discrimination in the buspirone group was difficult to establish due to potent response rate decreasing effects. Oxazepam was a very effective stimulus and the discrimination in the oxazepam group was readily established. Tests with oxazepam and pentobarbital in the buspirone group provided no evidence for generalization of the stimulus properties of buspirone to either drug. Tests with buspirone in the oxazepam group also provided no evidence of generalization to buspirone, although tests with pentobarbital indicated almost complete generalization. Finally buspirone and oxazepam were tested in a group of rats previously trained to discriminate pentobarbital from vehicle. The findings supported the data obtained in the buspirone and oxazepam groups, with no indication of generalization from pentobarbital to buspirone, but with complete generalization to oxazepam. These data suggest that buspirone does not share discriminative stimulus properties which are common to other CNS depressants.", 
    "24": "Clorazepate presents several problems in identification. In addition to rapid acid decarboxylation to N-desmethyldiazepam, a noncontrolled substance often confused with clorazepate, extracts of the pharmaceutical forms (Tranxene and Azene capsules) contain substances that interfere with isolation of intact and unaltered clorazepate. These substances have been identified and have been found to be quite dependent on both capsule type and, especially, on capsule age. The cause of the conversion of dipotassium clorazepate to the monopotassium salt, following solution, has also been identified. An infrared analysis method, which removes all of the interferences, is presented.", 
    "25": "Chronic administration of potassium orotate to rats per os in a dose of 100 mg/kg produces anxiolytic action that is manifested in antiaggressive, antiphobic and anti-conflict effects similar to the characteristic effects of diazepam. Besides, it provokes the changes in the spectral characteristics of the cat brain electrograms, common to tranquilizers. Based on the data obtained and analysis of the reported evidence the authors advance the hypothesis according to which endogenous pyrimidines, particularly orotic acid, possessing structural fragments necessary for the interaction with the sites of specific binding of 1,4-benzodiazepines may realize adaptive anxiolytic function both within the system of metabolic adaptation and when involved into the system of endogenous regulators and modulators of neuropsychic processes.", 
    "26": "The participation of GABA and some other transmitter systems in the regulation of the convulsive seizure threshold was studied using pharmacological tools. The convulsion were provoked by intravenous infusion of the GABAergic antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline and, in some cases, of pentylenetetrazole and strychnine. The GABAergic transmitter mechanisms were established to play a major role in the regulation of the convulsive seizure threshold. Of some importance is also the participation of benzodiazepine receptors, cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic mechanisms, as well as of cyclic nucleotides. The interactions between the GABAergic and dopaminergic, cholinergic mechanisms, cyclic nucleotides, benzodiazepine receptors may also play a role in the convulsive threshold regulation. The changes in the threshold of convulsive reactions are closely related to the decrease or increase of both central inhibition (pre- or postsynaptic) and excitation.", 
    "27": "14C-labeled 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-4H-imidazo [1,5a][1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride, 1 X HCl, was administered iv to two dogs. 14C-1 X HCl was extensively metabolized; in one dog, only 2% of the administered radioactivity was excreted as unchanged 1. The 4-hydroxy derivative of 1, compound 2, accounted for an additional 5% of the dose. Three urinary metabolites were identified by enzyme hydrolysis and NMR spectroscopy as conjugates of the phenolic 3'-, 4'-, and 5'-hydroxy derivatives of 1. In both dogs, the 4'-hydroxy derivative was the major identified metabolite (21 and 15% of the dose). Oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day of unlabeled 1 to dogs for 11 weeks resulted in the excretion of four urinary metabolites, the conjugated 3'-hydroxy and 4'-hydroxy derivatives of both 1 and 2. This prominent excretion of conjugated phenolic metabolites does not fit the usual pattern of 1,4-benzodiazepine metabolism in the dog.", 
    "28": "An increase in drug metabolic clearance results in a decrease in concentration of parent drug but the effect on concentration of metabolite has been unclear. The effect of increases in the clearance of parent drug and/or metabolite upon the metabolite concentration, metabolite-to-parent drug concentration ratio, and fraction metabolized is described theoretically. It is shown that several combinations of increases in specific clearances can lead to qualitatively similar effects on steady state concentration of metabolite. The effect of increases in metabolic clearances of the clobazam-norclobazam system caused by carbamazepine treatment was studied in normal volunteers. The steady state concentration of metabolite (norclobazam) increased 1.4-fold and the ratio of metabolite to parent drug increased 4-fold. These effects of carbamazepine on clobazam-norclobazam pharmacokinetics could be a result of five theoretical cases. It is concluded that at least the formation clearance of norclobazam was increased. Carbamazepine treatment caused at least a 4-fold increase in the N-demethylation clearance of clobazam. It was also deduced that, in the baseline state, no more than 70% of the clobazam dose was metabolized to norclobazam, even though the norclobazam concentration was more than twice the clobazam concentration.", 
    "29": "Loss of motor neurons is the primary pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Drug and neurotransmitter receptors are neuronal markers and can be indicators of neuronal connectivity. Knowledge of alterations in receptors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis should contribute to our understanding of normal spinal cord neurotransmitter systems as well as of the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We therefore used a sensitive, light microscopic in vitro labeling receptor autoradiographic technique to map and quantitate muscarinic cholinergic, glycinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors in three levels of spinal cord from six patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and six age- and sex-matched control patients. In control tissues, the receptor distributions were similar in the three levels of spinal cord and also similar to those found in previous studies with animals. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, major reductions in receptor densities were noted in Rexed layer IX, the region containing motor neurons. Reductions were noted in other laminae as well, particularly for muscarinic receptors. The changes in muscarinic receptors were caused solely by changes in high-affinity agonist sites. Reductions in glycine and muscarinic receptors were highly correlated with the degree of motor neuron loss found in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. The findings in this study point out the usefulness of this receptor mapping technique in understanding the changes in neuronal populations that occur in the degenerative neurological diseases.", 
    "30": "The efficacy of a number of bispyridinium compounds, including both oxime and non-oxime derivatives, has been determined against poisoning by sarin, soman, tabun and VX in guinea-pigs receiving various supporting treatments. In conjunction with atropine therapy only, the oximes were effective against sarin and VX poisoning and of them only the 4-substituted oximes were beneficial against tabun poisoning. None of the compounds was effective against poisoning by soman. When the supporting drug treatment consisted of pyridostigmine pretreatment and therapy with atropine and diazepam (this treatment itself gave considerable protection against organophosphate poisoning) both the non-oxime and oxime derivatives increased the protection against all four agents although obidoxime and TMB-4 were not beneficial against soman poisoning. The results are discussed in relation to published studies in which these compounds have been found to be beneficial against soman poisoning in atropine-treated rats and mice. It is suggested that the guinea-pig is a better model for predicting the efficacy of treatments for organophosphate poisoning in primate species.", 
    "31": "Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of involuntary motor movements, can be a permanent consequence of the long-term use of antipsychotic drugs. While there is no well-established drug treatment, case reports and the results of a few clinical studies suggest that drugs that facilitate the GABA-ergic system may decrease the abnormal movements. One such class of drugs is the benzodiazepines. We administered diazepam to 13 subjects in a 24-week, crossover design study. Tardive dyskinesia and psychopathology were assessed by blind raters using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The means of all movement measurements improved from the baseline, with orofacial, subtotal, symptom severity, and total reaching significance. However, we were unable to demonstrate a drug effect; the patients improved to a similar degree whether or not they received diazepam. Their psychiatric disorders did not worsen with diazepam administration and, in fact, improved slightly; the activation factor of the BPRS was significantly improved over baseline. Our results suggest that diazepam is not effective in managing the movements of tardive dyskinesia and that behavior modification strategies be investigated to help patients control symptoms.", 
    "32": "Triazolam is a sedative/hypnotic triazolobenzodiazepine, structurally related to alprazolam. Recently, it has been approved for the short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings. Triazolam is metabolized with a half-life of 1.5-5.0 hours. Its one active metabolite, which appears in low concentrations and is inactivated rapidly, is not thought to contribute to its pharmacologic activity. Triazolam has been shown to decrease sleep latency and the number of nocturnal awakenings while increasing total sleep time in patients with insomnia. Sleep electroencephalogram studies show that triazolam has no effect on delta-sleep (Stages 3 and 4) and has variable effects on rapid-eye-movement sleep. Nighttime administration of triazolam increases daytime alertness in insomniacs and improves or has no effect on performance. The reported side effects are similar to those of other benzodiazepines and include drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth. The recommended dosage of triazolam is 0.25-0.5 mg hs. A reduced initial dose of 0.125 mg should be used in geriatric patients.", 
    "33": "Irreversible photolabeling by [3H]flunitrazepam of four proteins with apparent molecular weights 51,000 (P51), 53,000 (P53), 55,000 (P55), and 59,000 (P59) was investigated in various rat brain regions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, fluorography, and quantitative determination of radioactivity bound to proteins. On maximal labeling of these proteins, only 15-25% of [3H]flunitrazepam reversibly bound to membranes becomes irreversibly attached to proteins. Results presented indicate that for every [3H]flunitrazepam molecule irreversibly bound to membranes, three molecules dissociate from reversible benzodiazepine binding sites. This seems to indicate that these proteins are either closely associated or identical with reversible benzodiazepine binding sites, and supports the hypothesis that four benzodiazepine binding sites are associated with one benzodiazepine receptor. When irreversible labeling profiles of proteins P51, P53, P55, and P59 were compared in different brain regions, it was found that labeling of individual proteins varied independently, supporting previous evidence that these proteins are associated with distinct benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "34": "Kinetics of five benzodiazepine hypnotics (15 mg flurazepam, 1 mg flunitrazepam, 5 mg nitrazepam, 10 mg temazepam, and 0.5 mg triazolam) were compared in the same group of 12 healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of parent drugs were determined by capillary gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. For flurazepam, the N-desalkyl metabolite (DAF) was measured. Flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, and triazolam were rapidly absorbed, although there was considerable variability; mean peak times (ranges) were: 1.3 (0.3 to 3) hr, 1.8 (0.7 to 6) hr, 1.2 (0.3 to 4) hr, and 1.1 (0.7 to 2) hr. Plasma concentrations of DAF increased rather slowly and reached their maximum between 3 and 48 hr after flurazepam. There were considerable differences in elimination t1/2s, with means of 35 (15 to 66) hr for flunitrazepam, 28 (22 to 33) hr for nitrazepam, 12 (8 to 22) hr for temazepam, 2.4 (1.4 to 3.9) hr for triazolam, and 84 (40 to 114) hr for DAF. Sex differences in elimination t1/2 were only observed for DAF: 99 hr in women and 69 hr in men. Our results show that there are considerable differences in the kinetics of the diazepines.", 
    "35": "Physostigmine salicylate (2.0 mg) or 0.9% NaCl (2.0 ml) was administered intravenously in a double-blind fashion to adult volunteers in an attempt to reverse the effects of a 0.05-mg/kg dose of lorazepam given intravenously 30 min earlier. No other medication affecting the central nervous system was given. No differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the frequency of amnesia, psychomotor impairment, or EEG changes during a period of 4 h. The only significant difference in the level of sedation between the two groups was observed 60 min into the study. This difference is attributed to the high incidence of nausea and vomiting that occurred at that time exclusively in one group. Time to complete recovery was the same in both groups. However, physostigmine, not saline, was associated with a high incidence of muscarinic and sympathetic stimulating effects. The results obtained indicate that at the dose used, physostigmine is of no clinical value in treating sedation induced by lorazepam.", 
    "36": "We recently demonstrated that the non-classical muscarinic receptor antagonist [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) identifies a high affinity population of muscarinic sites in the rat cerebral cortex. We now report that cortical muscarinic sites to which [3H]PZ binds with high affinity are modulated by ions but not guanine nucleotides. We also have examined equilibrium [3H]PZ binding in homogenates of various rat tissues using a new rapid filtration assay. All regional saturation isotherms yielded a similar high affinity dissociation constant (Kd = 2-8 nM) in 10 mM sodium-potassium phosphate buffer. Receptor density (Bmax in fmol/mg tissue) varied as follows: corpus striatum = 154.5, cerebral cortex = 94.6, hippocampus = 94.3, ileum = 1.3, cerebellum = 1.0, and heart = 0.45. The cerebral cortex and hippocampus possess 61 percent of striatal binding sites, while the ileum, cerebellum and heart contain only 0.84 percent, 0.65 percent and 0.29 percent of striatal sites respectively. The [3H]PZ sites in heart, ileum, and cerebellum represent 3.1 percent, 9.6 percent, and 10.4 percent of the sites obtained by using [3H] (-)quinuclidinyl benzilate. Thus, [3H]PZ labels high affinity muscarinic receptor binding sites with a tissue distribution compatible with the concept of distinct M1 and M2 receptor subtypes. Accordingly, regions such as heart, cerebellum, and ileum would be termed M2, though each have an extremely small population of the M1 high affinity [3H]PZ site. [3H]PZ therefore appears to be a useful ligand for M1 receptor identification. Furthermore, the inability to demonstrate a significant effect of guanine nucleotides upon high affinity [3H]PZ binding to putative M1 receptors suggests that M1 sites may be independent of a guanine regulatory protein.", 
    "37": "The analysis of 425 samples of blood, taken from people killed in motor vehicle accidents, showed that drugs were present in about 10% of samples, whereas alcohol was present in 51%. All drugs identified were available on prescription, and the most commonly found drug was diazepam.", 
    "38": "41 outpatients who were long-term consumers of diazepam in therapeutic dosage were gradually withdrawn from the drug over 3 months by stepwise reduction. In a double-blind procedure half the patients began withdrawal immediately and half after 8 weeks. Of 36 patients who completed treatment, 16 (44.4%) experienced true withdrawal phenomena on reducing their drugs, but 8 other patients had pseudo-withdrawal reactions at a time when their drug treatment was unchanged. The pseudo-withdrawal reactions consisted of an increase in anxiety symptoms only, whereas true withdrawal symptoms also included perceptual changes and psychotic symptoms. Examination of pharmacological and clinical predictors of withdrawal phenomena and later relapse showed that personality factors were the most important, patients with passive-dependent traits having a significantly greater prevalence of withdrawal reactions.", 
    "39": "Orthograde intestinal lavage was successfully used in the treatment of eight patients with acute poisoning. Three had mushroom (Amanita pantherina) poisoning, five acute drug intoxication (attempted suicide: diazepam, dihydropyridine, crotylbarbital, phenobarbital, amitriptyline and glibenclamide). Within 5-18 hours the clinical signs of poisoning regressed in four patient in stage IV (after Reed), so that the patients became responsive. Detoxication by orthograde intestinal lavage is achieved by mechanical removal of nonabsorbed compounds from the gastro-intestinal tract and via intestinal dialysis across the intestinal mucosa.", 
    "40": "Diltiazem, diazepam, and clonazepam effectively inhibit Na+-induced Ca2+ release from mitochondria isolated from rabbit heart and rat brain. At 10 mM NaCl, the 50% inhibition of the rate of Ca2+ release occurred at 5, 7, 40 and 350 microM of clonazepam d-cis-diltiazem, diazepam and 1-cis-diltiazem, respectively. Ro 15-1788 (imidazobenzodiazepine), a pharmacological antagonist presumably at the high affinity site of diazepam, had no effect either alone or in combination with diltiazem or diazepam. We suggest that the Na+/Ca2+ exchange carrier in mitochondria may be a common receptor for diltiazem and diazepam.", 
    "41": "The effect of flurazepam-HCl on single myelinated nerve fibres of the frog Rana esculenta was investigated. Flurazepam affected both Na and K currents: 0.25 mM of the drug decreased the peak Na inward current to about 50%. The initial increase and subsequent decay of the Na current was slowed down by a factor of 1.5 independent of membrane potential. The drug induced a slow phase in the recovery from Na inactivation and frequency dependence of the Na current block. The K current rose at a normal rate and was then inactivated to a sustained outward current. The time constant of block development (tau k) and the steady state block were potential-dependent. With 1 mM flurazepam, tau k decreased from 2.9 ms at E = 10 mV to 1.5 ms at E = 90 mV, and the steady state block increased from 65% at E = -20 mV to 81% at E = 90 mV. Recovery from the block proceeded faster at E = -70 mV (tau = 27 ms) than at E = -120 mV (tau = 89 ms). The effects of the drug on the K current were interpreted in terms of the reaction scheme proposed by Armstrong (J. Gen. Physiol. 54, 553; 1969).", 
    "42": "The binding of Tofizopam enantiomers to human serum albumin has been investigated by ultrafiltration and affinity chromatography. In solution, Tofizopam molecules exist in two conformations which slowly interconvert into each other. Both conformers of (R)-Tofizopam have the same binding constant of 4.8 X 10(3) M-1. The binding of the (S)-enantiomer, however, depends on the conformation. The minor and major (S)-conformers were characterized by association constants of 2.3 X 10(3) and 15.1 X 10(3) M-1, respectively. Thus, the stereoselectivity of binding differs for the two conformations of the enantiomers. Kinetic parameters for the interconversion of conformations have been determined. Tofizopam displaces both bound diazepam and warfarin.", 
    "43": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor from bovine cerebral cortex was solubilized with sodium deoxycholate and purified by affinity chromatography on benzodiazepine-agarose and ion exchange chromatography. The benzodiazepine binding protein was enriched 1800-fold. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol showed the presence of two major bands of Mr = 57,000 and 53,000. [3H]Flunitrazepam, after UV irradiation, was incorporated irreversibly into both bands of the isolated protein. A high affinity binding site for gamma-aminobutyric acid was co-purified with the benzodiazepine binding site and the two sites were shown to reside on the same physical structure. The dissociation constants were 10 +/- 4 nM for [3H] flunitrazepam and 12 +/- 3 nM for the gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist [3H]muscimol. The maximum specific activity for [3H] muscimol binding was 4.3 nmol/mg of protein. The ratio of [3H]muscimol to [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was between 3 and 4. Gel filtration and sucrose density gradient sedimentation studies gave a Stokes radius of 7.3 +/- 0.5 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 11.1 +/- 0.3 S, respectively. The purified complex had a pharmacological profile that corresponds to the receptor specificity found in membranes and crude soluble extracts.", 
    "44": "Alprazolam is the first of the triazolobenzodiazepines to be studied in a large population of depressed patients. In a six-week, double-blind multicenter comparison of alprazolam, imipramine hydrochloride, and placebo in the treatment of 723 patients with depression, the two active drugs were statistically more effective than placebo. Alprazolam was at least as effective as imipramine in relieving depressive symptoms, significantly more effective in relieving somatic symptoms, and showed an earlier onset of activity in some measurements. Anticholinergic side effects were reported most often by patients receiving imipramine, while drowsiness was the only side effect reported most often in the alprazolam group. The Feighner Diagnostic Criteria and prestudy and poststudy intercenter conferences with videotaped patient interviews ensured interrater reliability.", 
    "45": "Endotracheal intubation after administration of succinylcholine is associated with a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). That this is likely to have harmful effects in patients with penetrating eye injuries is self-evident. The efficacy of various means of abolishing these effects is debatable. This study evaluates pretreatment with intravenous lignocaine and diazepam in the prevention of high IOP during a standard induction-intubation sequence. Sixty patients were randomly divided into a control group receiving pretreatment with saline and two study groups receiving pretreatment with lignocaine and diazepam respectively. IOP, pulse rate and systolic blood pressure were recorded after induction, after intubation and after return of spontaneous respiration. Statistical analysis of the data showed that diazepam diminished the rise in IOP, while lignocaine had little effect (P less than 0,05). It is concluded that pretreatment with diazepam 0,05 mg/kg is beneficial in reducing the ocular risks of endotracheal intubation.", 
    "46": "The ability of the imidazodiazepine derivative Ro15-1788, a potent and specific displacer of benzodiazepine binding, to induce and reduce benzodiazepine-like activity has been evaluated against the convulsant activity evoked by leptazol, bicuculline and the convulsant benzodiazepine Ro5-3663, in mice. Ro15-1788 (10-50 mg/kg) produced a dose dependent reduction in the activity of all 3 convulsants (significant at 50 mg/kg), when they were given at just maximal convulsant doses, but this effect was lost with supramaximal doses of the convulsants, as used in other reported experiments. In addition to this weak benzodiazepine-like activity, Ro15-1788 also reduced the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam and a triazolopyridazine derivative but not that of phenobarbitone. This effect was more marked at 10 than 25 or 50 mg/kg Ro15-1788. It is concluded that although Ro15-1788 has a specific effect on drugs acting at the benzodiazepine receptor it should be classified as a weak partial agonist rather than an antagonist at this site.", 
    "47": "Diazepam and other benzodiazepines caused a concentration-dependent increase of [3H]muscimol (15 nM) specific binding. The maximal increase was 23.6 +/- 5% at the diazepam concentration of 10 microM. Concentrations of half-maximal stimulation for diazepam and clonazepam were 43 +/- 17 and 12.6 +/- 6 nM respectively. Ro 15-1788 was found to inhibit the stimulation of muscimol specific binding induced by other benzodiazepines. The IC50 for diazepam (1000 nM)-induced stimulation was 280 +/- 60 nM. Intensive treatment of membranes with Triton X-100 decreased the stimulatory effect of benzodiazepines.", 
    "48": "Rehydrating rats injected with diazepam (8 mg/kg, SC) increased their intake of 2.0% NaCl solution. Neither bilateral nephrectomy nor bilateral ureter ligation interfered with the increased NaCl solution ingestion produced by diazepam. It is concluded that the increased intake of the NaCl solution is not secondary to renal water-electrolyte losses nor dependent upon intact renal benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "49": "Previous investigations in our laboratory have demonstrated that after implantation of slow-release d-amphetamine pellets, rats with free access to water and a 10% ethanol solution selectively increase their consumption of the ethanol solution. We now report that this d-amphetamine treatment produces a similar increase in drinking of a benzodiazepine (diazepam) solution. Female albino rats were given free access to water and a 0.060 mg/ml diazepam solution and fluid intake was recorded every two days. The baseline consumption of diazepam averaged 25% of the total daily fluid intake. After d-amphetamine pellet implantation, rats increased their diazepam consumption to an average of 48% of total fluid intake, whereas rats implanted with control pellets containing vehicle only showed no change in diazepam drinking.", 
    "50": "Exposure of rats to the ether stress (2 X 2 min within 15 min) activated the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal (HHA) axis, as evidenced by the increased plasma corticosterone concentration, and affected the hypothalamic GABA system. The aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) or L-cycloserine-induced accumulation of GABA was decreased, and the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme responsible for GABA synthesis, was increased following ether stress. The concentration of GABA and the activity of GABA: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GABA-T), the enzyme responsible for GABA catabolism, remained unchanged under given conditions. Diazepam, a drug known to potentiate GABA-ergic transmission, elevated the concentration of plasma corticosterone, but prevented its further increase by ether stress. In spite of the diminished accumulation of GABA, the results might suggest that ether stress activates the hypothalamic GABA system, which is then able to prevent a further response of the HHA axis to stress.", 
    "51": "The K+-stimulated release of [3H]-D-aspartate and [14C]-GABA from synaptosomal (P2) fractions prepared from rat cerebellum was studied. Muscimol enhanced the release of [3H]-D-aspartate by 60-75% and the release of [14C]-GABA by 20-35%. Muscimol also enhanced the release of [3H]-D-aspartate from P2 fractions prepared from swine and mouse cerebellum. Pentobarbital, an anesthetic barbiturate, had no effect on basal or K+-stimulated release of [3H]-D-aspartate or [14C]-GABA but potentiated the enhancement of [3H]-D-aspartate release by muscimol. The EC50 was approx. 50 microM. The S(-)-isomer of pentobarbital was more potent than the R(+)-isomer in potentiating the action of muscimol, in agreement with the anesthetic potencies of the isomers. Phenobarbital, an anticonvulsant barbiturate, enhanced release of [3H]-D-aspartate and [14C]-GABA in the absence of muscimol. In contrast, the convulsant barbiturate 5-ethyl-5-(2'-cyclohexylidene-ethyl)barbituric acid (CHEB) caused a significant increase in basal release of [3H]-D-aspartate and [14C]-GABA in the absence of muscimol. Diazepam and ethanol had no effect on the release of [3H]-D-aspartate and did not potentiate the action of muscimol. These experiments provide biochemical evidence for an enhancement of the action of GABA by anesthetic barbiturates. This effect appears to be mediated through a benzodiazepine-insensitive presynaptic GABA receptor.", 
    "52": "Diazepam (Valium) had previously been shown to enhance the growth rate of some transplantable tumors although studies in other systems have suggested an inhibitory effect. Skin tumor promotion studies were therefore carried out to determine the effect of diazepam on 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) promotion in SENCAR mice. A sex-independent dose response inhibition occurred over a dose range of 100 g to 5 mg, both in number of papillomas and percent of mice bearing tumors. Furthermore, a dose-response reduction in tumor size was observed. By itself, diazepam had no tumor promoting activity.", 
    "53": "A rapid and simple analytical method is described for the determination of clonazepam in plasma using electron capture gas chromatography. Following a single microextraction with 100 microliter of toluene from 200-500 microliter of plasma, clonazepam is quantitated on a SP-2250 column with desmethyldiazepam as internal standard. There is no interference from endogenous substrates, clonazepam metabolites, or other commonly used antiepileptics. The lowest detectable clonazepam concentration by this method is about 1 ng/ml of plasma, which is sufficiently sensitive for both therapeutic monitoring of plasma levels and pharmacokinetic evaluation in patients and experimental animals.", 
    "54": "A patient developed severe anxiety, moodswing, depression, and thinking disorder 24 hours after abruptly stopping oxazepam, of which he had taken 30 mg 3 times a day for two months, for anxiety and panic attacks. Oxazepam was restarted and tapered off gradually; nevertheless, a relatively severe abstinence syndrome occurred. Muscular fasciculations and moodswing were very marked. The patient also experienced significant anxiety, depression, moodswing, and muscular fasciculations for two months after detoxication from oxazepam. Subsequently, the patient's panic attacks were treated successfully with propranolol hydrochloride. This report concludes with a brief review of the literature on benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "55": "Four brief case reports are presented from a series of Balint-type seminars on psychosocial problems at a university Family Medicine Centre. These cases illustrate the difficulties encountered by family practitioners when faced with a negative therapeutic response. When confronted by this outcome, it is important for the physician to define the dependency relationship which exists between himself/herself and the patient. It is often necessary to negotiate an explicit therapeutic contract. In doing so the physician should consider his own limitations of time, expertise and inclination and gather enough information to allow him to identify the focus of therapy and to consider his options for dealing with that specific focus.", 
    "56": "In 5 patients with malignant pleural effusion, neothramycin (NTM) was intrapleurally administered at a dose of 30 mg in 3 cases and 40 mg in 2 cases and the pharmacokinetics was studied by using compartment models. The results were as follows: 1) Pleural levels of NTM were described by a mono-exponential equation and the half-life ranged from 3.45 to 6.48 hr. 2) The time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 2 hr after pleural administration. The maximum levels were 54 to 106.4 ng/ml with the 30 mg dosage and 74.7 to 79.2 ng/ml with the 40 mg dosage, followed by a slow decline, with T1/2 ranging from 6.54 to 17.80 hr. 3) The elimination half-life of NTM in the plasma after intrapleural administration was much longer than that after intravenous administration. This phenomenon can be explained by a \"flip-flop model\": in this case, the rate of transfer from the pleural space to the plasma was much slower than that of the elimination from the plasma. 4) The parameters, K1 and K2, which were obtained by the deconvolution method, seemed to reflect the transfer of NTM between the pleural space and the plasma. 5) In 3 out of the 4 evaluable cases, an extreme decrease in the pleural fluid volume and suppression of reswelling were observed, including a case found to be negative for tumor cells upon cytodiagnosis.", 
    "57": "Good quality anaesthesia with smooth recovery can be induced by methohexitone 40 mg, ketamine 100 mg, diazepam 5 mg and alcuronium 15-20 mg and maintained with methohexitone 30 mg and ketamine 10 mg at 5-minute intervals and controlled ventilation with 30% oxygen in air. The technique is economical in running and capital costs and may have special implications for avoiding atmospheric pollution, for use in developing countries, and in emergency situations.", 
    "58": "Midazolam was given in a single 15-mg oral dose as a sedative the evening before elective cesarean section. Twelve hours later, levels of this new benzodiazepine were measureable in the fetomaternal entity in only one of 13 cases. After 15 mg midazolam orally or 0.05 mg/kg midazolam intramuscularly 15 to 60 min before elective cesarean section, there was evident transfer of drug into the placenta, but transfer took place more slowly than with diazepam. On the basis of kinetics derived from maternal serum concentrations after oral, intramuscular, or intravenous dosing, midazolam appears to have a rapid onset and short duration of action, which was also evident from subjective assessments by the patients. There was wide interindividual variation in the gastrointestinal absorption of midazolam in full-term pregnant women. Clinically, midazolam nevertheless seemed to be very useful for nocturnal sedation before elective cesarean section; it ensures a mean duration of sleep of about 6 hr and there are virtually no detectable levels of drug in the fetomaternal entity the next morning.", 
    "59": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has both stimulatory and inhibitory effect on human GH secretion. We previously reported that the benzodiazepine derivative diazepam, which exerts its main pharmacological effect by facilitating GABA-mediated transmission, is able to reduce the GH response to L-dopa and apomorphine. To establish whether diazepam affects the alpha-adrenergic regulation of GH secretion, the GH response to clonidine (an alpha-agonist) was investigated in seven volunteers after placebo and diazepam premedications. After placebo pretreatment, clonidine (0.15 mg iv infused over 20 min) significantly stimulated GH secretion: the mean serum GH level rose from a basal level of 4.7 +/- 1.1 (+/- SEM) ng/ml to a maximum of 10.8 +/- 1.6 ng/ml (P less than 0.025). After 3 days of diazepam treatment, a similar GH response to clonidine was observed; the mean serum GH level rose from a basal value of 2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml to a maximum of 9.4 +/- 1.3 ng/ml. It is concluded that the inhibitory effect of diazepam on human GH secretion is mediated via inhibition of dopaminergic transmission, whereas the alpha-adrenergic control of GH release is not affected. Since diazepam potentiates GABAergic transmission, its effect may reflect the role of endogenous GABA in human GH secretion.", 
    "60": "Parents with children who had presented with a simple febrile convulsion were advised to give their children rectal diazepam, in case of fever. The results (21 families with an average follow-up of 2 years) were compared with those in two groups of controls. The efficacy and inocuousness of prophylactic treatment are remarkable. However, its indication should be more precisely stated, after a better information of families and practitioners, since the expected effect on familial apprehension was not satisfactorily obtained."
