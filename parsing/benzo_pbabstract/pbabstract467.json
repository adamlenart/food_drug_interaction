    "0": "The pharmacological mechanisms underlying the hypolocomotion induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphated (CCK) in the mouse were examined using selective CCKA and CCKB receptor antagonists. Locomotor activity was measured in photocell cages. CCK (10 micrograms/kg i.p.) significantly reduced activity in mice tested in the afternoon but not in the morning, indicating a circadian variation in the effect of the peptide. The hypolocomotion induced by i.p. injection of 10 micrograms/kg CCK and i.c.v. injection of 3.5 micrograms CCK was reversed by the selective CCKA antagonist devazepide, but not by the selective CCKB antagonist L-365,260. This suggests that CCK-induced hypolocomotion is mediated by CCKA receptors. Larger doses of CCK were required to induce hypolomotion when injected i.c.v. (3.5 micrograms per mouse) than when given i.p. (10 micrograms/kg i.e. 0.2 microgram per mouse). Furthermore the latency to onset of the hypolocomotion after i.c.v. injection of CCK was longer than after i.p. injection of CCK. These data suggest that the sedative action of i.c.v. CCK may be due to leakage of the peptide from the brain and subsequent activation of peripheral CCKA receptors. However a role for CCKA receptors in the CNS in mediating hypolocomotion induced by i.c.v. injection of CCK cannot be ruled out on the basis of the present data.", 
    "1": "The pharmacology of the hypothermia induced by benzodiazepine and beta-carboline full agonists in mice has been investigated using partial agonists and antagonists from both chemical series. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg i.p.) blocked the hypothermia induced by loprazolam (3 mg/kg i.p.) but not that induced by the beta-carboline ZK 93423 (3 mg/kg i.p.). Both hypothermic responses were reduced by the beta-carboline antagonist ZK 93426 (3 mg/kg i.p.) and the benzodiazepine partial agonist Ro 17-1812 (10 mg/kg i.p.). On the other hand, the beta-carboline partial agonist ZK 91296 (30 mg/kg i.p.) blocked ZK 93423-hypothermia but not that induced by loprazolam. Thus, the hypothermic actions of benzodiazepine and beta-carboline agonists appear to be differentially antagonised by antagonists and partial agonists of the two chemical classes suggesting receptor subtype interactions which are non-uniformly related to the chemical class. These results cannot be explained simply in terms of pharmacokinetics or thermoregulatory effects of the compounds themselves. They suggest that, at least in the hypothalamus, different subtypes of benzodiazepine receptor may exist.", 
    "2": "L-Lysine enhanced the specific [3H]flunitrazepam (FTZ) binding of bovine brain membranes in vitro. Inhibition of specific [3H]FTZ binding to brain membranes in vitro by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) at concentrations 0.46 mM and below was reversed by increasing L-lysine concentrations in the incubation mixture; further increase of L-lysine concentration enhanced this binding. However, inhibition of [3H]FTZ binding by PTZ higher than 2.3 mM was reversed only partially by L-lysine. L-Lysine enhanced specific [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding on mouse brain membranes in a dose-dependent manner (EC approximately 5 microM). This enhancement was inhibited by PTZ dose dependently. Inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding by PTZ was attenuated slightly by L-lysine. L-Lysine enhanced [3H]FTZ binding in intact mice in a dose- or concentration-dependent manner with an ED50 of 6 mmol/kg body weight or EC50 of 3 mumol/g brain tissue, respectively. Similar effect was observed for L-lysine in ex vivo [3H]FTZ binding study when [3H]FTZ was incubated in vitro with an ED50 of 1 mmol/kg mouse or EC50 of 0.7 mumol/g brain. PTZ not only induced seizures, but also inhibited specific [3H]FTZ binding to brain membranes in a dose-dependent manner. L-Lysine, in a dose-dependent manner, suppressed seizures caused by PTZ at 50 or 60 mg/kg, or prolonged the time of seizure onset (seizure latency) caused by higher doses of PTZ (90 or 100 mg/kg). Pretreatment with L-lysine at 1, 5, 10 or 20 mmol/kg not only reversed the inhibition of the specific [3H]FTZ binding caused by PTZ at 50, 90 or 100 mg/kg, but also enhanced this binding above control level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "We have used SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging in non-human primates to examine the time course and pharmacological specificity of 123I-labeled Ro 16-0154 as an in vivo probe of the benzodiazepine receptor. Maximal brain uptake was reached approximately 70 min post i.v. administration of the radioligand and represented approximately 10% of the injected dose. The regional distribution of radioactive densities was consistent with the known distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in primate brain, with highest uptake localized over the occipital area. Washout of radioactivity was relatively slow with a rate of 3% per hour after the time of peak radioactivity. Injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (0.2-0.3 mg/kg i.v.) caused a rapid decrease of more than 90% of radioactivity from brain. In summary, [123I]Ro 16-0154 is a promising in vivo SPECT radioligand for the benzodiazepine receptor, with high brain uptake, a stable period of peak radioactivity, appropriate regional distribution, and ability to be displaced by other benzodiazepine receptor agents.", 
    "4": "Rats were tested for anticonvulsant responsivity to agents active at central and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors before and after they were made tolerant to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine on amygdala-kindled seizures. Tolerance to carbamazepine in this paradigm is a contingent process; it occurs when the drug is administered prior to, but not following the kindled seizure. In animals tolerant to carbamazepine, cross-tolerance was observed to the anticonvulsant effects of PK11195, which is active at peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, but not to diazepam, which affects central-type benzodiazepine receptors. In animals treated with carbamazepine after the kindled seizure (not tolerant), no alteration in the anticonvulsant effect of PK11195 was observed. These data extend previous biochemical and pharmacological findings suggesting the importance of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor mechanisms in the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine and suggest a role for this site in the process of contingent tolerance development.", 
    "5": "Retention of patients in methadone treatment was studied in a cohort of 238 heroin addicts who entered maintenance programmes between February 1986 and August 1987. All subjects had been assessed at a centralised unit and referred to one of two other units for maintenance. Of the ten client characteristics that we analysed, three--a history of imprisonment, a history of dependence on barbiturates or benzodiazepines and employment status at entry--were included with \"clinic\" and maximum dose of methadone in the Cox regression models. Allowing for the other four variables, the maximum daily dose of methadone dispensed during the study period was a highly significant predictor of retention (P less than 0.00001). With maximum dose stratified into three levels--less than 60 mg, 60-79 mg, 80+ mg--and with the lowest stratum used as the baseline, the relative risk (RR) of leaving treatment was halved (RR 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.67) for subjects receiving 60-79 mg, and halved again (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.12-0.38) for those who received 80+ mg. Clinic dosage policies contribute significantly to retention in methadone maintenance treatment. Clinics need to develop dosage policies in negotiation with individual patients.", 
    "6": "The effect of famotidine on gastric lesions induced by the decrease in mucosal defensive resistance was investigated in rats and compared with those of cimetidine, pirenzepine and cetraxate. Famotidine (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited dose-dependently the development of gastric lesions produced by taurocholate-histamine in doses that suppressed histamine-induced acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. The H2-antagonist also prevented gastric mucosal lesions induced by taurocholate-serotonin, iodoacetamide, acidified aspirin and acidified ethanol. Cimetidine, pirenzepine and cetraxate showed the inhibitory effects on almost all types of the gastric lesions, but their inhibitory effects were much less potent than those of famotidine. On the other hand, famotidine inhibited the decreases of gastric mucosal blood flow induced by acidified ethanol and the mucosal contents of glycoprotein induced by water immersion restraint stress. In addition, famotidine increased the transgastric potential difference (PD) and promoted the recovery of decreased transgastric PD induced by acidified ethanol in rats. These results suggest that the preventive effect of famotidine on gastric lesions is attributable not only to suppression of acid secretion but to activation of the gastric mucosal defensive mechanisms.", 
    "7": "The partition coefficient (P) of a benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam (FNTZ), was determined in a synaptosomal membrane/buffer system. A two component model was used, one of the components reflecting the drug partitioning into the membrane, and the other the amount of drug in the aqueous phase retained by the pellet after the centrifugation. The quantity of [3H]FTNZ measured as nonspecifically bound to the membrane includes both components so, the second one had to be discounted and in order to determined its magnitude a parallel experiment was performed using a non-partitioning hydrophilic drug (gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid, [3H]GABA). The assay required previous determination of the fraction of the total volume of the incubation system that corresponded to membrane (fm). The fm value was calculated from the density value (delta) determined by a picnometer method. The results obtained were: delta = 1.66 +/- 0.02; fm = (1.6 +/- 0.2) 10(-3); P = 18.5 +/- 0.8. This P value could explain nonspecific effects of BZDs on some functions of the neuronal membrane.", 
    "8": "We report an analysis of prescription drugs claimed under a government-sponsored, universal Pharmacare program for community-dwelling adults aged greater than or equal to 50 years in Manitoba during 1975, 1978, 1981, and 1984. We limited our analysis to claimants who reported over six drugs in a year in order to control for effects of inflation and a changing deductible. The median number of prescribed drugs and the percent of claimants over age 50 years receiving prescriptions from multiple physicians decreased during the course of our study. In this sample of heavy drug users, age and sex did not consistently correlate with overall drug use, although there was correlation for specific drug groups. The relative ranking of prescribed drugs changed over the years, although benzodiazepines, thiazide diuretics, topical steroids, and codeine-containing analgesics remained near the top. Barbiturates and topical antibiotics showed the greatest drop in prescription rates; acetaminophen and beta-blockers increased the most. Using these community data, we project the prevalence of drug-related adverse events to be highest with beta-blockers, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, thiazide diuretics, and benzodiazepines.", 
    "9": "Two criteria need to be satisfied in the demonstration of cross-dependence to chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in ethanol-dependent mice. These are the ability of CDP to suppress ethanol withdrawal and to maintain the dependent state. In this study, mice which had been fed chronically an ethanol diet followed by two days of CDP diet treatment had more severe CDP withdrawal signs induced by Ro15-1788 than drug-naive mice which were similarly exposed to the CDP diet treatment. The data indicate that CDP can maintain the dependent state acquired from the prior ethanol treatment. Alternatively, the prior ethanol treatment would have facilitated the development of CDP dependence, but it was not deemed likely. Three behavioral tests, namely, runway, sleep time, and drug-induced hypothermia, were used to test whether CDP could maintain the ethanol tolerance acquired from the prior ethanol treatment. The runway test showed that CDP could maintain the previously acquired ethanol tolerance. However, interpretations of the data from the sleep time and hypothermia tests are more equivocal because of factors such as peak tolerance, differential rates of development and dissipation of ethanol (or CDP) tolerance as determined by different behavioral tests.", 
    "10": "Relationships between social deprivation, dominance, and voluntary intake of ethanol (ETOH) and diazepam (D) were studied in male adult Wistar rats. Social behavior was registered by tetradic encounters in the open field prior to the rats' drug experiences. Social deprivation was induced by individual housing (LI) and contact caging (C). Nondeprived rats were housed in groups of four individuals (G) each. Social deprivation facilitated ETOH intake: LI rats consumed 30% more ETOH than G. Increase of deprivation by change of housing condition additionally raised ETOH consumption. ETOH experiences did not affect subsequent D choice. However, rats with a high ETOH consumption also preferred D. Individual drug disposition correlated with social dominance (in G: to social activity). Even in individual isolation dominant rats took less drugs than subordinate ones, but these rats raised their ETOH consumption when the housing conditions were changed. After nine months of voluntary ETOH intake and subsequently nine months without access to ETOH the rats showed signs of \"behavioral dependence.\" Compared to naive animals they took twice as much ETOH and even after adulterating ETOH by quinine a high preference was perpetuated. During this state modifying social factors were no longer effective.", 
    "11": "Following the establishment of a saccharin-amphetamine, saccharin-lithium or saccharin-saline association, rats were given a two-bottle test of preference for saccharin and water. Thirty min prior to the test, half of the rats were pretreated with chlordiazepoxide (9 mg/kg) and half of the rats were pretreated with saline. The results revealed that pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide (CDP) nonselectively enhanced saccharin consumption regardless of whether the flavored solution had been paired with amphetamine, lithium or saline. These results provide evidence that CDP enhances the palatability of flavored solutions.", 
    "12": "The effects of intragastric administration of the prototypical benzodiazepine (BDZ) anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and the non-BDZ anxiolytic agent buspirone (BUSP) on basal and stress-elevated plasma noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A) and corticosterone (CS) contents were investigated. Acute dosing of CDP (1-27 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in basal CS secretion but was without effect on basal NA levels. The high dose of CDP caused a slight short-term A increase. Dose-dependent increases in plasma A, NA and CS contents were observed after acute treatment with BUSP (2 and 20 mg/kg). A medium dose of CDP (9 mg/kg) attenuated the stress-induced CS and A elevations. High doses of CDP that elevated basal CS release prevented a further increase of CS by stress and inhibited the NA and A response to stress. BUSP (2 and 20 mg/kg) was not effective in decreasing the stress-elicited rise of CS, NA or A. Conversely, the 20 mg/kg dose of BUSP enhanced the stress-induced A response. Repeated administration of CDP (9 mg/kg/day for six days) produced tolerance to the elevation of basal CS triggered by acute CDP treatment, but increased the efficacy of the drug's CS and A attenuating action in stressed rats. Repeated administration of BUSP (2 mg/kg/day for six days) also produced tolerance to the acute BUSP-induced effect on basal CS release, but did not affect the stress-induced CS, NA and A responses. It is concluded that the clinically effective anxiolytic BUSP does not have the BDZ-like property to inhibit stress-induced elevations in CS, NA and A. Furthermore, the present data support other evidence that activation of 5-HT1A receptor mechanisms increases plasma catecholamine and corticosterone concentrations.", 
    "13": "The in vivo binding of [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]Fln) was characterized in seven regions of the mouse brain. The binding showed saturability and linear Scatchard plots. Hill coefficients were close to unity. Data fitting to a hyperbola by least squares yielded consistent Kd values for all regions studied (0.36-0.6 pmol/mg protein). Bmax values ranged from 0.14 to 0.89 pmol/mg protein, a sixfold regional variation. The order of binding is as follows: cortex greater than hippocampus greater than midbrain = thalamus/hypothalamus greater than striatum much greater than cerebellum greater than brainstem, consistent with that obtained by in vitro binding. The in vivo receptor density and affinity are apparently lower in comparison with in vitro parameters. This is consistent with the observation that the Kd increases and Bmax decreases in vitro when the incubation temperature is increased from 0 degrees C. Non-specific binding has been estimated by displacement of in vivo binding by unlabelled ligand in vitro as well as by pretreatment with unlabelled ligand. The two alternative methods were compared and evaluated. It is concluded that the displacement method provides more reliable estimates of the nonspecific binding. Diazepam-sensitive mice did not differ from the control mice in the in vivo [3H]Fln binding. However, mice pretreated with diazepam 1 or 2 days before have binding reduced by 70 or 30%, respectively. The reduced binding may be explained by receptor occupancy by residual oxazepam. However, the low concentration of the residual oxazepam is an unlikely cause of the phenomenon of \"acute tolerance\" observed in these mice.", 
    "14": "A sensitive method for the quantitation of small amounts of nuvenzepine, a new M1-selective antimuscarinic drug, in plasma is described. The analytical method involves the use of a radioreceptor binding assay based on [3H]pirenzepine displacement in rat cerebral cortex homogenates; no previous extraction is required. The method is reliable, with an interassay CV ranging from 5 to 10%, and allows the analysis of greater than 100 samples/experiment. The limit of detection is approximately 0.1 ng/assay. Using this method we have determined the plasma levels of nuvenzepine in eight healthy volunteers treated PO with 15 or 25 mg of nuvenzepine.HCl. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were (for 15 and 25 mg): Cmax, 64 and 131 ng/mL; AUC0-infinity, 851 and 1379 ng.h/mL; t1/2, 8.6 and 7.2 h. These values are in good agreement with those obtained using an HPLC method. Therefore, this radioreceptor binding assay proved to be simple, rapid, and specific for the determination of low levels of nuvenzepine in human plasma.", 
    "15": "The interaction between the benzodiazepine and the warfarin binding sites in human serum albumin (HSA) has been investigated using an HSA-based HPLC chiral stationary phase (HSA-CSP). (R)-Warfarin and (S)-warfarin were added to the mobile phase and racemic mixtures of oxazepam, lorazepam, and their hemisuccinic derivatives were injected onto the HSA-CSP. The presence of (R)-warfarin in the mobile phase did not significantly affect the chromatographic retention (expressed as capacity factor, k') of the investigated benzodiazepine hemisuccinate derivatives. The presence of (S)-warfarin did not significantly affect the k' of oxazepam and oxazepam hemisuccinate, but resulted in a dramatic increase in the k' of (S)-lorazepam hemisuccinate and also improved the enantiomeric resolution of lorazepam. These results confirm the existence of an allosteric interaction between the benzodiazepine binding site and the warfarin binding site. Furthermore, the study indicates that chromatography on the silica-immobilized HSA can detect interactions between binding sites on the protein. This can be of great importance in the determination of drug-drug interactions.", 
    "16": "Systematic treatment in children suffering from cancer pain is a field of pediatric oncology that was neglected for a long time. Investigations have shown that pain therapy oriented to the special situation of the child's body is urgently necessary. In Germany, an unpublished study by Fengler (Berlin), who reviewed all pediatric cancer centers, revealed serious deficiencies in the therapy of pain in children. In our study, we attempted to develop a new concept of cancer pain management, with the emphasis on cooperation between pediatric oncologist and anesthesiological pain therapists. PATIENTS AND METHODS. A total of 36 children and adolescents suffering from malignant tumors and in whom pain therapy according to WHO stage III was necessary were treated. After being seen by a pediatric oncologist and an anesthetist (pain therapist) each patient received either slow release oral morphine (MST, 0.5-1 mg/kg per dose) two to three times a day or a continuous infusion of morphine (0.05 mg/kg per h). The amount of morphine administered was quickly raised until the young patients were free of pain. Drug actions (pain score) and side effects were registered continuously with a documentation form. The morphine was combined with dipyrone 5-15 mg/kg per dose five times a day. The intravenous dosage of oral dipyrone was 2-5 mg/kg per h. RESULTS. The average age of the patients treated was 12 years (1.5-19 years); 10 were inpatients, and 26 were outpatients. All patients were treated successfully. The doses of morphine required for pain relief varied substantially (1-25 mg/kg per day p.o. and 0.05 mg-1 mg/kg per h i.v.). We did not observe extreme sedation or respiratory depression. In our patients we did not observe opioid-induced nausea such as is frequently seen in adults. All children needed laxatives. In 2 children, intolerable itching was experienced after oral administration of slow-release morphine. In 20 patients cortisone was given as adjuvant therapy, in 5 patients with neuropathic pain, anticonvulsants e.g., carbamazepine. In 6 patients we administered benzodiazepines successfully for sedation and anxiolysis. CONCLUSIONS. Therapy of pain in children with advanced cancer requires interdisciplinary cooperation. In most children therapy of pain can be successfully administered with slow-release morphine in combination with dipyrone, so that the children can remain in their usual social environment.", 
    "17": "Although the general pharmacokinetics of midazolam (M) are well documented, little is known about the possible effects of a thigh tourniquet on the distribution and elimination of this drug. METHOD. Institutional approval for the study and individual informed consent were obtained. We studied 30 patients (ASA-I) without premedication who electively underwent a surgical procedure of the lower limb. Patients were divided into three groups of 10. The procedure was done in groups I and II with and in group III without tourniquet use. Anesthesia was induced in groups I and II with 0.1 mg/kg M, fentanyl 5 micrograms/kg, alcuronium-dichloride 0.15 mg/kg and etomidate 0.1-0.2 mg/kg i.v. and maintained with enflurane 0.3-1.0 vol.-%. About 20 min after midazolam injection and after exsanguination the tourniquet was applied on the proximal thigh in group I. In group II anesthesia was induced with etomidate 0.2 mg/kg and alcuronium-dichloride 0.15 mg/kg i.v., and maintained about 20 min with enflurane 1.0-1.5 vol.-% until exsanguination and tourniquet application. After this, these patients also received 0.1 mg/kg M and 5 micrograms/kg fentanyl i.v. Through an indwelling arterial line, blood samples were obtained prior to and 2, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165 and 180 min after M injection. Plasma M levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. These concentrations were fitted to a two-compartment open model. Comparison between groups was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and p less than 0.05 was considered to indicate significance. RESULTS. The groups were all comparable in age and weight, and groups I and II also in duration of thigh ischemia. Midazolam elimination half-time (t beta 1/2) was significantly shorter in group II than in groups III and I (52 min vs 126 min and 139 min; p less than 0.05). Of the calculated distribution volumes (volume of the central compartment, volume in the steady state and volume in the elimination phase), only the volume in the steady state was significantly smaller in group II than in groups III and I (p less than 0.05). Groups III and I did not differ significantly in the computed parameters. The measured initial midazolam mean concentrations in group II were twice those in groups III and I (655 ng/ml vs 323 ng/ml and 332 ng/ml). Since clearance was not significantly different between any two groups, the shorter t beta 1/2 in group II was probably due to the reduced distribution volume. CONCLUSION. These data demonstrate that in the presence of a thigh tourniquet the timing of the injection - before or after application of the tourniquet is of decisive importance. Injection after the application of a tourniquet leads to an higher plasma level and shortens the elimination half-life.", 
    "18": "Tilest 500 contains tiletamine and the water-soluble benzodiazepine zolazepam in the ratio 1:1. The drug was administered intramuscularly in ten dogs at a dosage of 10 mg/kg bwt of tiletamine and 10 mg/kg bwt of zolazepam and tested for its effects on hemodynamics, respiration, and the antagonistic effect of flumazenil. Initial effects occurred quickly, analgesia and muscle relaxation were excellent 10 minutes after administration. There was a highly significant increase in heart rate and a slight decrease in both mean arterial blood pressure and arterial pO2. In a second group of ten dogs the interventricular paraconal branch of the left coronary artery was ligated which induced local myocardial ischemia. Here Tilest 500 showed electrostabilizing and antifibrillatory properties even in the presence of severe arrhythmias. The benzodiazepine compound of this drug combination can be antagonized by flumazenil. To avoid excitatory reactions flumazenil should not be injected earlier than 45 to 60 minutes after administration of Tilest 500.",

The compounds exhibiting significant anticonvulsant and analgesic activity also showed marked inhibition of the enzyme MAO. The low toxicity of these compounds was reflected by their high approximate LD50 values.", 
    "20": "Fifty-five young adult patients completed a study comparing alprazolam, propranolol, and placebo in the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks. Twenty completed 5 weeks of treatment with alprazolam. No concomitant psychological treatment was administered. Plasma alprazolam levels were determined at baseline and at the end of the trial by means of automated gas chromatography. These levels were significantly correlated with dose (p = 0.001). Dividing the data into quartiles based on alprazolam concentration, no direct, linear relationship was found between alprazolam levels and response (as defined by a criterion of zero panic attacks). However, analysis of the combined middle two quartiles versus the combined upper and lower quartiles showed a positive trend toward a curvilinear relationship; i.e., there was a greater response rate within the 18-62 ng/ml concentration range than in the combined 0-17 plus 63-107 ng/ml range, (chi 2 = 2.4; p = 0.12). The findings are very preliminary in nature. It remains to be seen if the results will reach significance with a large sample size and a more tightly controlled study design.", 
    "21": "1. The tritiated muscarinic antagonist N-methyl scopolamine, [3H]-NMS, was used to characterize the muscarinic receptors associated with the intact dog tracheal smooth muscle cells. Based on receptor binding assays, the intact tracheal smooth muscle cells had specific, saturable, high-affinity binding sites for [3H]-NMS. 2. Specific binding was cell concentration- and time-dependent. The specific binding of [3H]-NMS was increased linearly with increasing cell concentrations. The equilibrium for association of [3H]-NMS with the muscarinic receptors was attained within 30 min at 37 degrees C. 3. Binding was saturable with respect to [3H]-NMS concentrations. Analysis of binding isotherms yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 320 +/- 20 pM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 13.7 +/- 1.4 fmole per 5 x 10(4) cells. The Hill coefficient for [3H]-NMS binding was 1.00 +/- 0.01. The association (K1) and dissociation (K-1) rate constants were determined to be (1.19 +/- 0.23) x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 0.034 +/- 0.09 min-1, respectively. KD, calculated from the ratio of K-1 and K1, was 286 +/- 65 pM; this value is close to the value of KD calculated from Scatchard plots of binding isotherms. 4. The non-selective muscarinic antagonist atropine and M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine did not reveal any selectivity of these muscarinic receptors. Pirenzepine competed with [3H]-NMS for a single binding site with a Ki value of (6.02 +/- 0.69) x 10(-7) M which is close to the value of M2 or M3 receptors, indicating that the M1 receptor subtype did not exist in the intact tracheal smooth muscle cells. 5. Competition with cardioselective antagonist (M2), methoctramine; smooth muscle selective antagonists (M3), hexahydrodifenidol and hexahydrosiladifenidol; as well as carbachol, were best fit by a two-binding site model. The results suggest that both M2 and M3 receptor subtypes exist at the cell surface of tracheal smooth muscle cells.", 
    "22": "1. Plasma catecholamine (CA) levels were examined in rats exposed to SART (specific alternation of rhythm in temperature) stress, a repeated cold stress. Effects of neurotropin, a sedative analgesic, and alprazolam, an anxiolytic, on the changes in plasma and brain CA levels were then studied. 2. SART stress induced remarkable increases in plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA). The plasma adrenaline (Adr) level also increased significantly, but the extent was smaller than that of NA or DA. 3. Repeated treatments with neurotropin reduced the stress-induced increases in plasma and brain NA and DA levels significantly and dose-dependently. 4. Repeated treatments with alprazolam markedly reduced all increases in plasma and brain CA levels. 5. The above findings suggest that SART-stressed animals are in an increasing state of sympathetic neuronal activity and in a slightly increasing state of adrenal function. Neurotropin is also suggested to have modulating effects on autonomic imbalance in both catecholaminergic and cholinergic nerves.", 
    "23": "The pharmacokinetics of adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD) were studied in 14 healthy male volunteers who received 15 mg adinazolam mesylate orally as a solution and 5 mg adinazolam mesylate intravenously in a crossover design. Two weeks prior to the crossover study, each subject received 5 mg/kg indocyanine green (ICG) as an intravenous bolus injection to estimate liver blood flow. The absolute bioavailability (F), calculated as the dose-corrected ratio of oral to iv adinazolam area under the curve (AUC) values, was found to be 39%. NDMAD AUC values were similar following oral and iv administration, and adinazolam mean absorption time was approximately 0.77 hr. Thus, adinazolam is completely and rapidly absorbed after oral administration in man; the incomplete bioavailability is due to first-pass metabolism. Mean liver blood flow, adinazolam systemic clearance, blood/plasma ratio, and extraction ratio were 1189 ml/min, 498 ml/min, 0.70, and 0.57, respectively. The extraction ratio agrees with that calculated as 1-F (0.62), suggesting that the liver is primarily responsible for first-pass metabolism of adinazolam. The unbound fraction of adinazolam in plasma was 0.31 (range, 0.25-0.36); adinazolam free intrinsic clearance (a reflection of metabolic capacity) was 4285 ml/min (range, 2168-6312 ml/min). These results suggest that the majority of the variability in adinazolam plasma concentrations following oral administration is due to the variability in the metabolic capacity of the liver for adinazolam, rather than variability in plasma protein binding.", 
    "24": "Airborne operations may demand an intense level of activity prior to parachuting. In addition the movement of troops to the theatre of operations may well involve the crossing of several time zones. These factors may well deprive the troops of sleep. Furthermore, a parachute assault may well be at night leading to a long period without rest. Scheduled sleep may help ameliorate this sleep deprivation. Studies have shown that daytime sleep prior to overnight activity can improve performance. A study was undertaken to see whether temazepam would improve daytime sleep during a scheduled rest period compared to placebo. The results showed a significant increase in the average sleep period in the group taking 20mg and 10mg of temazepan compared to placebo. The quality of sleep was also improved yet there was no difference in subjective alertness between the groups six hours post ingestion.", 
    "25": "Midazolam 4 mg i.m. (Group M, n = 15) was compared with hydroxyzine 50 mg i.m. (Group H, n = 13) in a randomized double-blind study, as premedicants for patients undergoing simple total hysterectomy under combination of spinal and epidural anesthesia with midazolam sedation. Reduction of anxiety and amnesic effects about procedure under regional anesthesia with sufficient patient co-operation were greater following midazolam. The doses for intraoperative sedation of midazolam and pentazocine were the same in both groups. Mean doses of midazolam 2 mg and pentazocine 6 mg were required to induce sleep. Maintenance doses of midazolam and pentazocine were 3.7 and 11.4 mg.hr-1, respectively. No patient had recall of surgical procedure. Midazolam did not delay the postoperative resedation which lasted about 2 hours. The decrease in O2 saturation by pulse oxymetry is significant in Group M (4.5%) than Group H (2.7%). Nevertheless two patients in each group required oxygen 2 liter.min-1 via a nasal catheter. These results indicate that premedication by midazolam is more effective for procedures under regional anesthesia.", 
    "26": "A retrospective review of 150 cases determined the contribution of salicylate assays, tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) screens, and benzodiazepine screens to the diagnosis of overdose patients. Seventy percent of salicylate assays and 42% of TCA screens were ordered when there was no history of ingestion of clinical indication of overdose with these agents. In 12% of the cases benzodiazepine screens did not provide useful information. A positive history of salicylate ingestion, tinnitus and hyperventilation were the best predictive indicators of salicylate ingestion. The best predictors of TCA toxicity were a positive history of ingestion, a decreased level of consciousness, and a prolonged QRS interval. The combination of a positive history of ingestion and a decreased level of consciousness was a sensitive indicator of benzodiazepine toxicity. The annual cost of screens/assays which did not contribute to diagnosis was estimated to be $4649. Based on this study, a thorough history and clinical assessment of the overdose patient takes precedence over analytical screens in determining the drug(s) involved.", 
    "27": "Thirty depressed psychiatric inpatients, including 18 with a diagnosis of major depression, and 25 hospital staff controls were compared with respect to cellular immune function--that is, mitogen responsiveness to concanavalin A (con A), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM); natural killer cell (NK) activity; and T cell subsets, including helper/inducer T cells (CD4) and suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8). Only physically healthy subjects, who had not used psychoactive medications (except for low dose benzodiazepines) or other medications known to affect the immune system for at least 14 days, were included. Paired comparisons of the immune measures of patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of major depression (n = 18) with their controls demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of the patients' con A response. In addition, the patients with major depression had significantly lower con A and PHA responses than the combined patients with other forms of depression (atypical, dysthymic, or atypical bipolar). There was no indication that severity of depression, dexamethasone suppression test status, benzodiazepine use, or age accounted for the differences in immune function. A possibly important, unexpected finding was that antihistamine use was associated with lower immune function.", 
    "28": "1. Three recently described non-peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonists (devazepide, lorglumide, loxiglumide) have been studied for their antagonism of the contraction to cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP) in human alimentary muscle and guinea-pig intestine. 2. Each antagonist caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the contraction induced by CCK-OP, regardless of regional and species differences. 3. The potencies of each drug, estimated by use of an adaptation of the Cheng & Prusoff equation, were similar in the different regions of human alimentary tract (weighted mean apparent pKB, +/- s.e. mean: devazepide, 5.76 +/- 0.08, n = 20; lorglumide, 5.82 +/- 0.04, n = 25; loxiglumide, 5.87 +/- 0.07, n = 24). 4. In contrast, the potencies differed markedly in the guinea-pig ileum. Apparent pKB values obtained by the same method as with human tissues were, mean +/- s.e.mean: devazepide, 10.61 +/- 0.61; lorglumide, 7.43 +/- 0.20; loxiglumide, 6.67 +/- 0.12. pKB values obtained from classical competition experiments were: devazepide, 10.09 +/- 0.09; lorglumide 7.70 +/- 0.12; loxiglumide 6.08 +/- 0.22. 5. The CCK receptors in human gut muscle from different regions seem to be similar, but there appear to be species differences.", 
    "29": "1. Muscarinic receptors on endothelial cells of bovine thoracic aorta were characterized by binding assays in which (-)-[3H]-N-methyl quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-NMeQNB) was used as radioligand. 2. Binding of [3H]-NMeQNB to crude membranes of freshly isolated endothelial cells was atropine-displaceable and of high affinity (KD = 0.48 nM) to a single class of sites (maximum binding capacity: 14 +/- 3 fmol mg-1 protein). Stereospecificity of the binding sites was demonstrated in experiments in which [3H]-NMeQNB binding was inhibited by dexetimide in the nanomolar range (KI = 0.63 nM) and by levetimide, its stereoisomer in the micromolar range (KI = 3.2 microM) (selectivity factor: approximately 5000). 3. Drug competition curves indicated a single class of binding sites for antagonists and the following apparent affinities (KI, nM): methyl atropine: 1.1: 4-diphenylacetoxy N-methyl piperidine methyl bromide (4-DAMP): 3.4; pirenzepine: 16; 11-[2-diethylamino-methyl)-1-piperidinyl- acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)1,4-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116); 2.500. Competition of acetylcholine with [3H]-NMeQNB was best described by two affinity sites (or states) (KH = 0.82 microM, KL = 1.6 microM). In the presence of guanylimido diphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] (100 microM), acetylcholine affinity (IC50) was slightly, but significantly reduced (factor approximately 4). 4. Binding of [3H]-NMeQNB to freshly harvested intact cells was also atropine-displaceable, stereospecific (selectivity factor: approximately 3500) and of high affinity (KD = 0.35 nM). The maximum binding capacity (9 +/- 2 fmol mg-1 total cell protein) was comparable to that of membranes and corresponded to approximately 900 binding sites per endothelial cell. Binding to enzymatically harvested and cultured endothelial cells, or membranes derived therefrom, showed no atropine-displaceable binding. 5. The results suggest that (1) bovine aortic endothelial cells contain muscarinic binding sites with all necessary criteria of functional muscarinic receptors; (2) the receptor most closely corresponds to the M1 subtype and is of comparatively very low density, and (3) cultured endothelial cells lose their receptors during isolation or culture procedures.", 
    "30": "Rectal indomethacin was compared with placebo in a randomised, double-blind study of 100 patients undergoing spinal surgery, in which postoperative pain scores, pethidine, diazepam and metoclopramide consumption, bleeding time, blood loss and oral fluid and food tolerance were measured. Side-effects of indomethacin and pethidine were compared in the two groups. In the indomethacin group, pain scores were significantly less for all measurements made during the first three postoperative days, pethidine and diazepam consumption were significantly less on all three days, bleeding time was significantly increased, although still within the clinically normal range, intraoperative and postoperative blood losses were not significantly affected, coagulation was not significantly impaired as assessed clinically, patients tolerated oral feeding significantly earlier, there was no significant increase in the incidence of gastro-intestinal side-effects except for diarrhoea, and there was no significant reduction in the incidence of side-effects associated with the use of pethidine.", 
    "31": "Patients (aged 65 years or older) who were hospitalized for rehabilitation therapy after a cerebrovascular accident or other acute debilitating condition participated in a 6-week controlled clinical trial. After a 2-week period of receiving nightly single-blind placebo, patients were randomly allocated to receive either triazolam (0.125 mg) or flurazepam hydrochloride (15 mg) nightly under double-blind conditions. For the final 2 weeks, patients again received single-blind placebo. The study groups' were comparable in their performance on four psychomotor tests done in the morning during the initial placebo period. Triazolam-treated patients showed subsequent improvement on the tests, consistent with practice effects, whereas flurazepam recipients showed performance impairment during treatment. Triazolam-flurazepam differences were significant in the card-sorting and arithmetic tests, and they approached significance for the Purdue pegboard test. Blind ratings by physical therapists indicated significant impairment among flurazepam recipients in their capacity to cooperate with and participate in the rehabilitation tasks; the impairment persisted into the post-treatment placebo period. Similar flurazepam-triazolam differences, although not significant, were reported by occupational therapy and nursing staff members. The findings suggest that the kinetic differences between flurazepam and triazolam may have clinical implications in elderly patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy.", 
    "32": "A number of different progestogens, levonorgestrel (LNG), norethisterone (NET), gestodene (GSD), desogestrel (DG) and norgestimate (NORG) are used in combination with the oestrogen ethinyloestradiol (EE2) in oral contraceptive steroid preparations. All the progestogens are acetylenic steroids and previous studies have indicated the potential of acetylenic steroids to cause mechanism-based or \"suicide\" inactivation of cytochrome P-450. We have compared the effects of the different progestogens on EE2 2-hydroxylation (a reaction catalyzed by enzymes from the P-450IIC, P-450IIIA and P-450IIE gene families) and also the oxidative metabolism of other drug substrates (cyclosporin, diazepam, tolbutamide) by human liver microsomes. On coincubation with EE2 as substrate, GSD, 3-keto desogestrel (3-KD, the active metabolite of desogestrel) and LNG produced some concentration-dependent inhibition of EE2 2-hydroxylation (maximum 32% inhibition at 100 microM 3-keto desogestrel). Ki values determined for GSD and 3-KD were 98.5 +/- 12.3 and 93.2 +/- 10.3 microM (mean +/- SD; n = 4), respectively. Preincubation of progestogens in a small volume (50 microliters) incubation for 30 min in the presence of an NADPH-generating system enhanced the inhibitory potential of all the steroids (at 100 microM, inhibition was for GSD 39%, 3-KD 46%, LNG 46%, NET 51% and NORG 43%). Inhibitory effects were therefore comparable and also similar to the macrolide antibiotic troleandomycin. The most marked inhibition seen was of diazepam N-demethylation and hydroxylation by GSD (71 and 57%, respectively) and 3-KD (62 and 50%, respectively). In preincubation studies involving cyclosporin as the substrate, the order of inhibitory potency was GSD greater than 3-KD greater than NET greater than LNG for production of both metabolite M17 and M21. The results of the study indicate that all the progestogens in common use have the propensity to inhibit a number of oxidative pathways but there is little evidence for one progestogen being more markedly inhibitory than others.", 
    "33": "Psychopharmacological studies usually attempt to eliminate \"nonspecific\" influences on outcome by double-blind designs. In a randomized, double-blind comparison of alprazolam, imipramine, and placebo, the great majority of panic disorder patients (N = 59) and their physicians were able to rate accurately whether active drug or placebo had been given. Moreover, physicians could distinguish between the two types of active drugs. Inasmuch as correct rating was possible halfway through treatment, concerns about the internal validity of the double-blind strategy arise.", 
    "34": "Major causes of drug-induced psychoses include cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine, cannabinoids, LSD, mescaline, the so-called designer drugs, anticholinergic compounds, and steroids. Most drug-induced psychoses are managed with general supportive measures, reassurance, minimizing patient stimulation, and benzodiazepines as needed; however, specific antidotes such as physostigmine for anticholinergic poisoning or urinary acidification to enhance excretion of amphetamines or phencyclidine may be indicated in some patients. Any patient with a drug-induced psychosis must be evaluated carefully for evidence of other toxic effects of the drug in question.", 
    "35": "Binding of L-tryptophan, diazepam and octanoate to defatted human serum albumin was studied at pH 7.0 by equilibrium dialysis at low ligand/protein molar ratios. L-Tryptophan binding takes place at only one site of the protein with an association constant of 4.4 x 10(4) M-1. Under the present experimental conditions, binding of diazepam and octanoate could be accounted for by high-affinity binding alone with primary association constants of 3.8 x 10(5) M-1 and 1.6 x 10(6) M-1 respectively. During the simultaneous presence of L-tryptophan plus octanoate or diazepam plus octanoate, pronounced mutual reductions in binding were observed. Analysis of the data suggests that the reductions in binding represent competition for a common high-affinity binding site. Thus a region seems to exist that is capable of binding one molecule of these diverse ligands with a high affinity. The location of this region within the albumin molecule is discussed.", 
    "36": "Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects of benzodiazepines. It acts by binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and competitively blocking benzodiazepine activation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Animal studies and some human studies appear to demonstrate that flumazenil has weak intrinsic agonist activity; on the other hand, studies are inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent. Evidence available suggests that flumazenil is well tolerated in human beings over a broad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does not produce serious adverse effects. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Repeat doses can be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines. Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration; should this drug receive approval, it is likely to be used in emergency departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings. First, it could be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has been administered to facilitate medical, orthopedic, and surgical procedures, particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second, flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have taken benzodiazepine overdoses. Although most of these patients can be managed successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that the use of flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term endotracheal intubation. Finally, flumazenil could have both diagnostic and therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown etiology, particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration. Because flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced respiratory and CNS depression, it could be used empirically to confirm or exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in turn might obviate the need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive (eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This might be particularly useful because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs or symptoms that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated on clinical grounds. Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of this new agent.", 
    "37": "In this investigation we evaluated the effect of two new cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonists, CR 1409 and L364,718, on gallbladder emptying in the opossum. Gallbladder emptying was elicited by both exogenous and endogenous CCK. The three test challenges were 1) intravenous infusion of CCK octapeptide (OP) (10 ng.kg-1.min-1), 2) feeding, and 3) intraduodenal infusion of Isocal (0.4 ml/min), a fat-containing nutrient. During control conditions each test challenge elicited approximately 60% gallbladder emptying within 30 min and 70% emptying by 60 min. At given doses both CR 1409 and L364,718 substantially antagonized or abolished the gallbladder emptying elicited by each of the test challenges. The antagonism for postprandial gallbladder emptying was diminished between 30 and 50 min compared with that for CCK-OP infusion and intraduodenal infusion of Isocal. Unexpectedly, the gallbladder emptying induced by infusion of motilin (5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) was antagonized by either CR 1409 or L364,718. In anesthetized animals, gallbladder contraction was induced by a variety of agonists, such as bethanechol, histamine phosphate, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and phenylephrine. In this later model CR 1409 and L364,718 functioned solely as selective antagonists. We conclude that for the opossum gallbladder 1) the CCK antagonists CR 1409 and L364,718 antagonize or abolish gallbladder emptying induced by exogenous or endogenous CCK; 2) the pattern of CCK antagonism after feeding suggests that the early phase of postprandial gallbladder emptying is mediated by a mechanism other than endogenous CCK, whereas late postprandial emptying is mediated by release of endogenous CCK; and 3) CR 1409 and L364,718 are not totally specific antagonists for gallbladder CCK receptors alone but also antagonize gallbladder contraction induced by motilin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Previous studies have demonstrated that gastrin and the COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8) stimulated in vitro acid secretion from isolated rabbit gastric parietal cells. Both peptides bind to receptor sites located on these cells and induce an increase in phosphoinositide turnover and an uptake of [14C]aminopyrine ([14C]AP) with the same efficacy and potency. In the present study, we used the 3-(benzoylamino)-benzodiazepine analogue L365,260 and the 3-(acylamino)-benzodiazepine analogue L364,718 to investigate what type of receptor (gastrin type or CCK-A type) is involved in the regulation of the H+ secretory activity of the rabbit parietal cell. Neither L365,260 nor L364,718 alone caused stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]InsP) production. Each analogue inhibited 125I-labeled gastrin or 125I-CCK-8 binding to parietal cells and gastrin- or CCK-8-induced [3H]InsP production and [14C]AP accumulation. In all cases, L365,260 was approximately 70-100 times more potent than L364,718 (IC50 approximately 2-4 nM for L365,260 and approximately 0.2-0.4 microM for L364,718). Nevertheless, each antagonist displayed the same potency to inhibit the effects of gastrin or CCK-8. These results demonstrate that gastrin and CCK-8 interact with the same \"gastrin-type\" receptor on parietal cells. Moreover, L365,260 behaves as a competitive antagonist of the action of gastrin on parietal cells. Gastrin induces a rise in the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] within the first seconds after parietal cell stimulation. The fact that L365,260 (10 nM) totally suppressed the gastrin-induced formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 suggests the involvement of these isomers in the mediation of acid secretion through gastrin receptor activation.", 
    "39": "A series of 6-substituted 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methylimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin- 2(1H)-ones (9) have been synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of the HIV-1 virus in MT-4 cells. Two synthetic methods are described, one of which allows the synthesis of single enantiomers of the final products. A structure-activity study was done within the series of compounds to determine the optimum group for the 6-position substitution and to determine whether the activity was enantiospecific at the 5-position, which was substituted with a methyl group. The best analogue, 9jj, inhibited HIV-1 with an IC50 of 4 microM, which is comparable to the activity level of DDI, a 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside-type structure undergoing clinical trials as an anti-AIDS therapy.",

The author sets the stage for our current understanding of panic disorder by describing the historical development of our knowledge of this disorder, past and current psychiatric diagnostic systems, and the symptoms of panic disorder.

Panic disorder may entail considerable morbidity, particularly if left untreated. This observation, coupled with clinical experience that the benefits of pharmacologic treatment generally outweigh their risks, suggests that patients with panic disorder should be treated with medication. A decision tree for the acute and maintenance treatment of panic disorder patients is presented, and possible indications for both acute and maintenance treatments are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of treatment with each of the three classes of drugs that have been found effective for panic disorder--the tricyclic antidepressants, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the benzodiazepines--are reviewed.", 
    "42": "In this paper, the author reviews the existing knowledge regarding the long-term treatment of panic disorder, including extensive clinical experience and data available from controlled studies. He conceptualizes long-term treatment in four phases--acute, stabilization, maintenance, and discontinuation--and in discussing these phases, outlines specific treatment goals for each of them. He presents measures for the management of withdrawal symptoms and relapse, focusing on the use of a slow taper over 3 to 6 months. The author then reviews the limited data currently available on long-term treatment outcome, including comparisons of 2 and 8 months of treatment demonstrating greater improvements with the longer treatment, and presents follow-up data 3 to 6 years after pharmacologic treatment. From clinical and research experience, he concludes that longer-term treatment of panic disorder is indicated for full recovery, although further studies are needed.",

On HSA the binding occurs at the benzodiazepine-indole binding site via hydrophobic interaction and shows slight stereoselectivity preferring the trans isomers. The binding to alpha 1-AGP proved to be highly stereoselective in favour of the trans isomers having 3(S),16(R)eburnane or 1(R),12b(S)indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidine absolute configurations.", 
    "44": "A variety of muscarinic antagonists are currently used as tools to pharmacologically subclassify muscarinic receptors into M1, M2 and M3 subtypes. In the present study, we have determined the affinity profiles of several of these antagonists at five cloned human muscarinic receptors (m1-m5) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). At all five receptors, the (R)-enantiomers of trihexyphenidyl and hexbutinol displayed considerably higher affinities (up to 525-fold) than their corresponding (S)-isomers. The stereoselectivity ratios [inhibition constant(S)/inhibition constant(R)] for both pairs of enantiomers were lowest at m2 receptors, suggesting that less stringent configurational demands are made by this receptor subtype. The \"M1-selective\" antagonist (R)-trihexyphenidyl displayed high affinities for m1 and m4 receptors. The \"M2-selective\" antagonists himbacine, (+-)-5,11-dihydro-11- ([(2-[(dipropylamino)methyl]-1- piperidinyl)ethyl)amino]carbonyl)-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6- one (AF-DX 384), 11-[4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b) (1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one (AQ-RA 741) and (+)-(11-[2-[(diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11-di-hydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4) benzodiazepine-6-one [AF-DX 250; the (+)-enantiomer of AF-DX 116] exhibited high affinities for m2 and m4, intermediate affinities for m1 and m3 and low affinities for m5 receptors. This selectivity profile was most prominent for AQ-RA 741, which displayed 195- and 129-fold higher affinities for m2 and m4 receptors than for m5 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "To test the reported antipanic efficacy of clonazepam, the authors randomized 72 subjects with panic disorder to 6 weeks of treatment with either alprazolam, clonazepam, or placebo. Endpoint analysis demonstrated a significant beneficial effect of both active treatments, but not placebo treatment, on the frequency of panic attacks, overall phobia ratings, and the extent of disability. Comparison of the two active treatments revealed no significant differences and no consistent tendency for one agent to be favored over another, although power to detect small differences was limited. Sedation and ataxia were the most common side effects reported, but these effects were mild and transient and did not interfere with treatment outcome. The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial are consistent with previous reports of clonazepam's antipanic efficacy.", 
    "46": "The benzodiazepine antiepileptic drug clobazam can be added to existing AED treatment, usually without clinical toxicity. We report 3 patients in whom the addition of clobazam led within several weeks to clinically obvious phenytoin (PHT) intoxication in patients who had been taking maximum tolerable PHT doses. Symptoms and high PHT levels resolved with lowering the PHT dose. Clobazam and norclobazam levels were not elevated. This interaction is probably related to interference with hepatic degradation of PHT. Clinicians should be aware of possible PHT intoxication in patients starting clobazam.", 
    "47": "Nasally administered midazolam appears to be a useful method for rapidly sedating children prior to the induction of anesthesia. We determined the peak plasma concentrations after intranasal administration of midazolam and compared this to plasma concentrations achieved after intravenously administered midazolam in 18 children between the ages of 14 months and 5 yr, who underwent elective closure of an asymptomatic atrial septal or ventricular septal defect. Preanesthetic medication was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Induction of anesthesia was with halothane in N2O and O2 via mask, and tracheal intubation was performed after the administration of fentanyl or sufentanil plus pancuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with these agents, and augmented with halothane or isoflurane. As soon as arterial access was established, the patient received 0.1 mg/kg of either intranasal or intravenous midazolam. Midazolam concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Intranasal midazolam achieved its peak plasma concentration of 72.2 +/- 27.3 ng/ml in 10.2 +/- 2 min. Ten minutes after the administration of midazolam, the mean plasma concentration in the intranasal midazolam group was 57% of the concentrations in the group receiving midazolam intravenously. These results confirm the clinical impression that intranasal administration of midazolam rapidly achieves sedative plasma concentrations in children.", 
    "48": "We studied the percutaneous losses of sevoflurane and isoflurane during administration and elimination in seven healthy male volunteers. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl, midazolam, and/or thiopental, and nitrous oxide for 30 min, after which 1% sevoflurane and 0.4% isoflurane in 65% nitrous oxide were administered for 30 min. Inspired, end-tidal, and mixed-expired gas samples were collected during administration and for 5-7 days of elimination. To measure percutaneous loss, each subject's arm was enclosed in a glass cylinder sealed at both ends and with two ports, one for flushing with nitrogen and one for obtaining gas samples during the 30 min of administration and the first 150 min of elimination. Anesthetic concentrations in all samples were determined using gas chromatography. The surface area of the arm was measured and the total surface area was calculated. During administration and elimination, percutaneous loss of isoflurane was significantly greater than that of sevoflurane (P less than 0.05). For both volatile agents, losses during elimination were greater than during administration (P less than 0.05), but even when combined, these losses were too small to affect kinetic or metabolic studies based on mass balance.", 
    "49": "The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil is currently under intense study. Despite much clinical experience, no detailed invasive hemodynamic studies of its use in cardiac patients have been published. In the present study, hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured in 10 cardiac patients undergoing catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart, before and after sedation with intravenous diazepam, and after reversal of sedation with flumazenil. A sleep dose of diazepam (12.2 +/- 5.1 mg, mean +/- SD) caused only slight decreases in mean arterial pressure (103 +/- 12 to 98 +/- 14 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (13.2 +/- 6.3 to 11.7 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (20.8 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 10.0 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), with no significant changes in respiratory gas homeostasis. Intravenous flumazenil (0.22 +/- 0.07 mg) resulted in spontaneous awakening and return to full orientation, yet caused no significant alteration in either hemodynamic or respiratory variables measured. Reversal of diazepam-induced sedation by flumazenil in cardiac patients appears safe and effective.",

The rats were chronically fitted with electrodes implanted on the cecum and proximal colon and cannulas placed bilaterally in either the ventromedial or lateral hypothalamus. In fasted rats, microinfusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide (10 ng/kg) into the ventromedial hypothalamus increased the spike-burst frequency of the cecum and the colon by 45.6% and 43.7%, respectively, during the 30-minute period after treatment. The injection of cholecystokinin octapeptide (10 ng/kg) into the lateral hypothalamus had no effect on either cecal or colonic motility. Feeding increased the frequency of cecal and colonic spike bursts by 52.1% and 50.1% for 30 minutes postprandially. When infused bilaterally into the ventromedial hypothalamus 10 minutes before feeding, L364,718 (1 or 5 micrograms/kg) abolished the increase of the frequency of cecal and colonic contractions induced by the meal. Infused into the lateral hypothalamus at similar dosages, L364,718 had no effect on the postprandial enhancement of cecocolonic motility. Increase of cecocolonic spike-burst frequency induced by feeding or by cholecystokinin octapeptide injected into the ventromedial hypothalamus was abolished by previous intracerebroventricular but not intraperitoneal administration of atropine (1 microgram) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (1 microgram), a selective muscarinic M2-receptor antagonist. In contrast, pirenzepine (1 microgram, intracerebroventricularly) did not significantly reduce the meal- or cholecystokin octapeptide-induced increase in cecal and colonic motility. These results suggest that, in rats, (a) cholecystokinin octapeptide is involved in the generation of the cecocolonic motor response to a meal and these effects are mediated through cholecystokinin octapeptide receptors located in the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, and (b) these postprandial colonic motor changes involve central cholinergic activation through muscarinic M2 receptors.", 
    "51": "The gastric acid inhibitory activities of a peptide-like gastrin receptor antagonist, Boc-beta Ala-Trp-Leu-Asp-O(CH2)2-Ph-4-F (CH-486), a nonpeptide gastrin/CCK-B antagonist (L-365,260), and a CCK-A antagonist (L-364,718), were investigated in the gastric lumen-perfused anaesthetized rat. A single i.v. injection of CH-486, 100 mumol/kg, reduced acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin, 15 micrograms kg/h, to unstimulated levels, with no recovery within 50 min. Histamine-, 0.1 mumol kg/min, and carbamylcholine-, 0.1 mg kg/h, stimulated acid secretion were also reduced to unstimulated levels by CH-486, 100 mumol/kg, although with these latter two stimulants the inhibition was transient. L-365,260 and L-364,718, 10 mumol/kg, significantly inhibited both pentagastrin- and histamine-stimulated acid secretion, the latter again transiently. We conclude that the non-selective nature of the gastric acid inhibitory activity of gastrin antagonists might allow novel approaches to control gastric acid secretion in peptic ulcer disease.", 
    "52": "The autoradiographic distribution and density of muscarinic receptors was studied in the neostriatum of rats with long-term unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and in lesioned rats who had additionally received embryonic substantia nigra grafts in the dopamine denervated striatum. Muscarinic receptors were labeled with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), M1 receptors were directly labeled with [3H]pirenzepine (PZ) and non-M1 receptors were labeled by the competition of 100 nM PZ with [3H]QNB. The density and distribution of muscarinic receptors were directly compared to the sodium-dependent, high-affinity, choline uptake sites as labeled with [3H]hemicholinium-3 (HC-3). In the 6-OHDA-lesioned animals, there was a 25% reduction in muscarinic receptors labeled with [3H]QNB. Subtype analysis showed that there was a reduction of both M1 (-26%) and non-M1 (-33%) receptors. A normal density of both muscarinic receptor populations was found in animals with successful transplants. Saturation analysis demonstrated that the changes, in muscarinic receptor density, were due to a change in receptor number (Bmax) and not affinity (Kd). There was no significant change in [3H]HC-3 binding in the 6-OHDA-lesioned or transplanted animals, indicating that alterations in muscarinic receptors were not due to transynaptic degeneration of striatal cholinergic interneurons. The findings of downregulation of muscarinic receptors following long-term dopamine denervation and the subsequent normalization of muscarinic receptor density after fetal mesencephalic transplantation suggests that transplanted substantia nigra cells are able to restore inhibitory control on striatal cholinergic interneurons.",

Twelve normal volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over sleep study. A clear dose-response relationship was found for ritanserin with higher doses evoking increased duration of slow wave sleep.", 
    "54": "Sixteen consecutive adult patients scheduled for permanent transvenous cardiac pacemaker insertion received as their total anesthetic the combination of a cervical plexus block and blocks of the second, third, and fourth intercostal nerves using a combination of 1% mepivacaine and 0.2% tetracaine with epinephrine, 1:200,000. This technique consistently provided complete surgical anesthesia of the third cervical (C3) through the fourth thoracic (T4) dermatomes, without anesthesia of the brachial plexus. Anesthesia was adequate for the surgical procedure without the need for supplemental analgesia or anesthesia in all cases. Because fluoroscopy was used routinely for the surgical procedure, it was possible to document that there were no instances of diaphragmatic paralysis or pneumothorax. In contrast to other reports, this technique provides surgical anesthesia that is adequate for all of the approaches used for transvenous pacemaker implantation, except for placement of a battery in an abdominal pouch. There were no serious complications and/or side effects in any of the patients studied.", 
    "55": "The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam was studied in 10 geriatric patients (5 males, 5 females) with neurotic depression during a 6-week period. After 0.5 mg of alprazolam on Day 1 the mean elimination half-life was 11.1 hr and Cmax 12.3 ng/ml. The pharmacokinetic evaluation on Day 1 (t 1/2, tmax) did not differ significantly from the evaluation on Day 42. The mean daily dosage on Day 42 was 1.6 mg alprazolam. The concentrations of the metabolites alpha-OH alprazolam and 4-OH alprazolam were less than 10% of that of alprazolam. All the patients improved clinically. The most common side effect was drowsiness, more often during the first week than the last week.", 
    "56": "Ninety-five women undergoing induced abortion were randomly premedicated with oral diazepam, 5 or 10 mg, midazolam 15 mg, or intramuscular placebo, 40-60 min before the induction of anesthesia. Prior to premedication and again prior to the procedure, the women completed the questionnaire sheet for the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and plasma samples for immunoreactive beta-endorphin (ir beta-E) and ACTH were taken. The Oblique Tension-Anxiety (T-A) Factor scores derived from POMS correlated with plasma concentrations of ir beta-E and ACTH after premedication. The T-A scores decreased in women premedicated with diazepam, 5 and 10 mg, or midazolam, 15 mg, but not in women treated with placebo. The women premedicated with midazolam, 15 mg, became more fatigued after premedication. The changes in blood pressure after premedication correlated with T-A scores. A positive correlation was found between heart rate and plasma beta-endorphin concentration. The changes in ir beta-E and ACTH did not correlate with the changes in T-A scores. We conclude that POMS T-A scores are useful for assessment of preoperative anxiety and the effect of premedication. The present study did not provide any reliable proof to confirm the hypothesis of a relationship between plasma concentrations of ir beta-E or ACTH and preoperative anxiety. Since many factors modulate endorphin and ACTH secretion prior to operation, the measurement of endogenous opiates may be of limited value in assessment of the effects of preanesthetic medication.", 
    "57": "To evaluate the possibility that abnormal regulation of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) function may relate to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, two doses of the BZR antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) and placebo were administered to panic disorder patients in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. All 11 patients received flumazenil (600 mg). Ten of the 11 also received flumazenil (200 mg), and 8 of the 11 were given matching placebo capsules orally on separate test days. Neither dose of flumazenil showed significant anxiolytic effects or significantly altered heart rate, blood pressure, or levels of plasma cortisol or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol in comparison to placebo. On 200 mg days, anxiety ratings on a visual analog scale significantly increased compared to placebo at 30 min and then returned to baseline levels. Panic attacks occurred on placebo, 200 mg, and 600 mg days in 0/8, 4/10, and 0/11, respectively. Failure to observe anxiolytic effects suggests that flumazenil at these doses does not antagonize a tonic increased interaction of BZRs with an endogenous BZR inverse agonist in panic patients.", 
    "58": "The involvement of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A(GABAA) receptor complex in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was examined in galactosamine-treated rabbits with HE caused by fulminant hepatic failure. Radioligand binding to the constituent components of the GABAA receptor complex was unchanged in rabbits with HE. However, partially purified extracts from encephalopathic rabbit brain were approximately three times more potent in inhibiting [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding to benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors than extracts from control rabbits. The inhibition of radioligand binding to the BZ receptor produced by these extracts was competitive and reversible and was significantly enhanced by GABA. Further purification of these extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that the inhibitory activity was localized in several peaks, some of which had retention times corresponding to 1,4-benzodiazepine standards. The presence of diazepam in these extracts was confirmed using mass spectroscopy. Both mass spectroscopic and radiometric techniques demonstrated that the concentration of diazepam in brain extracts from encephalopathic rabbits was approximately 4 times greater than control extracts. These findings link the presence of BZ receptor agonists to the development of a neuropathological condition, thereby providing a rational basis for the use of BZ receptor antagonists in the management of HE in man.", 
    "59": "Recent advances in experimental tumor biology are being applied to critical clinical problems of primary brain tumors. The expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, which are sparse in normal brain, is increased as much as 20-fold in brain tumors. Experimental studies show promise in using labeled ligands to these receptors to identify the outer margins of malignant brain tumors. Whereas positron emission tomography has improved the dynamic understanding of tumors, the labeled selective tumor receptors with positron emitters will enhance the ability to specifically diagnose and greatly aid in the pretreatment planning for tumors. Modulation of these receptors will also affect tumor growth and metabolism. Novel methods to deliver antitumor agents to the brain and new approaches using biologic response modifiers also hold promise to further improve the management of brain tumors.", 
    "60": "The murine GABAA/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) receptor alpha 1 subunit cDNA has been isolated from a BALB/c mouse brain library and sequenced. The cDNA is 2665 nucleotides long with an open reading frame of 455 amino acids. It shows significant homology to the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit cDNA sequences of other species. Excluding deletions, the murine GABAA alpha 1 receptor exhibits 96% nucleotide and 100% amino acid sequence homology to the rat alpha 1 receptor cDNA and over 91% nucleotide and 98% amino acid sequence homology to the bovine and human alpha 1 receptor cDNAs in the protein coding region. This murine cDNA was used to locate the alpha 1 receptor subunit gene, Gabra-1, to murine Chromosome 11 between Il-3 and Rel. This assignment extends proximally the segment of mouse Chromosome 11 with known homology to human chromosome 5.", 
    "61": "Despite treatment, emesis remains a major problem with cisplatin chemotherapy. Three potent antiemetics, metoclopramide, dexamethasone and lorazepam, were combined in prophylaxis of 18 patients receiving cisplatin based combination chemotherapy. In 75 courses of chemotherapy, 57% experienced complete protection from vomiting and 89% of treatment courses had two or fewer vomiting episodes. Complete protection and mild episodes from nausea was 47% and 53% respectively. Toxicities were mild and infrequent. It was concluded that combination of high-dose metoclopramide, dexamethasone and lorazepam was highly efficacious in preventing nausea and vomiting in moderate or high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy with little side effects.", 
    "62": "gamma-Aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors are multisubunit ligand-gated ion channels which mediate neuronal inhibition by GABA and are composed of at least four subunit types (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta). The gamma 2-subunit appears to be essential for benzodiazepine modulation of GABAA receptor function. In cloning murine gamma 2-subunits, we isolated cDNAs encoding forms of the subunit that differ by the insertion of eight amino acids. LLRMFSFK, in the major intracellular loop between proposed transmembrane domains M3 and M4. The two forms of the gamma 2-subunit are generated by alternative splicing, as demonstrated by cloning and partial sequencing of the corresponding gene. The eight-amino-acid insertion encodes a potential consensus serine phosphorylation site for protein kinase C. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of the GABAA receptor by protein phosphorylation.", 
    "63": "Midazolam might be an alternative to general anesthesia for noncooperative children. 40 children were treated during 94 midazolam sedations to evaluate the potential dental therapy. An average of 2 fillings and 1 endodontic treatment was possible per sedation. The initial Midazolam dosage was 0.6 mg/kg. Every 15 min another 0.3 mg Midazolam/kg were administered to maintain the treatability of the children. 30 min after the initial Midazolam dosage dental treatment could be started. The average duration of a sedation was 76 min. Our results suggest that sedations complement under dental treatment general anesthesia.", 
    "64": "Tonic and rhythmic activity of the masticatory muscles accompanied by a loud and grating or clicking sound characterizes bruxism, a well-recognized parasomnia. We describe a 63-year-old man who complained of insomnia due to repeated tongue nibbling during sleep. Nocturnal polysomnographic recordings showed brief (50-100-ms) myoclonic jerks of myloioideus and masseter muscles occurring during phase 1 of sleep and leading to troublesome tongue nibbling with arousal of the patient. Hypnograms showed reduction of phase 2 and absent phases 3-4 and REM. Different pharmacological treatments including clomipramine, benzodiazepines, and carbamazepine were ineffective. A purposive interdental plate was placed to prevent jaw closings during sleep: masticatory myoclonus still persisted, but it did not provoke arousals; insomnia disappeared and night hypnograms improved.", 
    "65": "The effects produced by IP administration of these three agents in the rat were compared because of in vitro evidence that each modulates the picrotoxinin site of the GABAA receptor. For each, hypothermia had the lowest threshold and convulsions the next, with hypophagia produced only by the highest dose of either Ro 5-4864 or lindane. Convulsant effects had a shorter latency and a shorter duration than did hypothermia. Hypophagia, when present, lasted the longest. Myoclonus was the seizure type with the lowest threshold for all three agents. At the highest dose, lindane produced a high incidence of maximal clonic (hopping) seizures, whereas Ro 5-4864 and picrotoxin produced a high incidence of maximal tonic seizures instead. On a mole/kg basis, picrotoxin was 40 times more effective than the other two agents and produced seizures which started later, peaked later, and persisted longest. Ro 5-4864 and lindane were effective at equimolar concentrations and, in combination, produced effects which suggested either dose-addition or synergism. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the toxic effects of both Ro 5-4864 and lindane may be attributable, at least in part, to an action at a subpopulation of GABAA receptors.", 
    "66": "The effects of the benzodiazepine clonazepam (a drug used as anticonvulsant) on event-related brain potentials were investigated in healthy human subjects. Thirty-six male student volunteers (mean age 30 years) received clonazepam or a placebo in a double-blind setting. VEPs (visual evoked potentials) were obtained from the standard checkerboard reversal procedure; AEPs (auditory evoked potentials) and slow cortical potentials (CNV) were measured during a 2-stimulus reaction time paradigm, in which the quality of the acoustic S1 signalled whether the acoustic S2 would follow after 2 sec or after 6 sec. Each S2 requested a speeded button press. Compared to placebo, clonazepam significantly reduced P100 amplitude of the VEP and the amplitudes of the AEP components N1 and P3. On the other hand, clonazepam boosted the development of a distinct N2 which was not apparent in placebo subjects. The CNV was significantly reduced and reaction time increased under clonazepam compared to placebo. Specific versus non-specific damping effects of the benzodiazepine are discussed, comparing the present result with the pattern of ERP effects of the anticonvulsant carbamazepine that had been obtained using the same experimental paradigms.", 
    "67": "The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor involved in contraction of guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle to cholecystokinin is poorly understood; some studies have suggested that contraction was mediated via a CCK-A receptor whereas other studies have implicated CCK-B receptors in ileal contraction to CCK. To clarify this, we compared the effects of CCK-8 sulfate, CCK-4 and gastrin in radioligand binding studies and longitudinal ileal contractility in vitro. Contraction to all three peptides was abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 x 10(-7)M), confirming the neuronal nature of the CCK receptors mediating contraction to all three peptides. Maximal CCK-8S contractions were inhibited by 80% in the presence of atropine (10(-6)M), and entirely by the combination of atropine and a substance P receptor antagonist (3 x 10(-5)M). CCK-4 and gastrin-induced contractions were unaffected by substance P receptor blockade, but were abolished by atropine. Two selective CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists, L-364,718 and L-365,260, respectively, were used to probe further the receptors involved in ileal contraction to this peptide family. Radioligand binding studies in mouse brain, rat pancreas and guinea pig stomach confirmed the selectivity of these antagonists. The CCK-A selective antagonist, L-364,718, potently inhibited ileal contractions to CCK-8S (-log KB = 9.35) with 10-fold lower affinity at receptors mediating contraction to CCK-4 (-log KB = 8.25). In contrast, the CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260, did not affect contraction to CCK-8S (-log KB less than 7) but potently inhibited contraction to CCK-4 (-log KB = 9.24).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "Effects of the selective M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine and the selective M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 on ganglionic transmission were examined in anesthetized dogs, in order to elucidate a functional role of M1 and M2 receptors. Preganglionic or postganglionic stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerves (SNS, 0.5-16 Hz) produced frequency-dependent increases in heart rate. Pirenzepine (3-100 microgram/kg) caused dose-dependent and significant inhibition of positive chronotropic response to preganglionic SNS but not to postganglionic SNS. AF-DX 116 (10-100 micrograms/kg) had no effect on the preganglionic SNS-induced tachycardia. The simultaneous administration of pirenzepine (30 micrograms/kg) and hexamethonium (C6, 1 mg/kg), and the subsequent administration of 10 mg/kg of C6, inhibited more potently the tachycardic responses to preganglionic SNS than each dose of C6 did by itself. The enhancement by pirenzepine of the C6-induced inhibition was evident at high frequencies (8 and 16 Hz) of SNS. In contrast, the blocking effect of C6 (1 and 10 mg/kg) on ganglionic transmission was significantly attenuated by AF-DX 116 (30 micrograms/kg). The attenuation by AF-DX 116 was observed at a wide range of stimulation frequency (0.5-8 Hz). These results suggest that M1 receptors play a facilitatory role in ganglionic transmission but M2 receptors do not contribute to the transmission when nicotinic pathway is intact. However, the activation of M2 receptors would further suppress ganglionic transmission when nicotinic transmission is inhibited. Under these conditions, activation of M1 receptors would mediate the transmission elicited by high frequency of stimulation.",

    "74": "Mice of the two substrains AB/Gat and AB/Hal from the Jena AB inbred strain differ in behavior from each other by their aggressiveness occurring especially in the latter group after maturity. In order to ascertain the neurobiological background of aggressiveness, we injected mice of both substrains with either haloperidol, diazepam, or hexobarbital and measured their response on motor activity. In a second experiment, the reaction to a seizure evoking agent (pentylenetetrazol) was determined. Mice of both substrains were found to differ significantly in their reaction to haloperidol or diazepam injection. In contrast to that no changes in motor activity could be detected following hexobarbital administration. Animals of the aggressive AB/Hal substrain reacted more pronounced to pentylenetetrazol than those of the AB/Gat group. In conclusion, the varying aggressiveness of both AB mice substrains may be due to differences in dopaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "75": "The influence of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone upon the reduced locomotor activity after administration of nitrazepam (NTZ) and upon the increased locomotion after chronic nitrazepam administration was tested. It was found that a single dose of naloxone counteracted both the reduced locomotion after acute administration of nitrazepam as well as the augmented locomotor activity after chronic application of nitrazepam. It is assumed that opioid mechanisms are involved in the locomotor effects of benzodiazepines.",

In-patient consumption increased with patient age and both prescriptions and consumption were greater in women than men.", 
    "77": "Standard and more recent advances in treatment of acute mania are reviewed with special emphasis on controlled studies. Lithium is still the drug of choice and the most common treatment for mania, but some of its limitations have become more apparent, and specific indications for its use are defined. Alternatives to lithium are recommended for psychotic, rapid cycling, severely manic, and lithium-refractory patients. Neuroleptics are effective and used commonly but carry risks of long term side effects. Substantial reduction in neuroleptic dose and duration of exposure is probably feasible in many patients. Neuroleptic-lithium combinations are popular but do not have clear advantages over treatment with a single drug in the initial treatment of acute mania. These combinations have also been associated with increased neurotoxicity. Carbamazepine, both alone and in combination with lithium, has been used increasingly over recent years. Its efficacy is comparable to lithium, but clinical features predicting responsiveness may be different for these two drugs. Carbamazepine-neuroleptic combinations offer little advantage over neuroleptics alone. Valproic acid, verapamil, clonazepam, lorazepam, benzodiazepine-neuroleptic combinations, clonidine, tryptophan, propranolol, and electroconvulsive therapy are also popular, but their effectiveness has not yet been adequately confirmed by controlled studies.", 
    "78": "Exposure of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells to ethanol [50 mM], alprazolam [10(-7) M] and buspirone [10(-7) M] inhibited basal and carbachol-induced release of catecholamines from these cells. The inhibition produced by alprazolam was prevented, and that produced by ethanol inhibited, by the presence of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil [10(-8) M]. The inhibition produced by buspirone was unaffected by flumazenil, but was mimicked by the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH DPAT and prevented by the 5-HT receptor antagonist spiperone [10(-6) M]. These results suggest that bovine adrenal chromaffin cells express GABAA receptors, containing a benzodiazepine recognition site and also 5-HT1A receptors. Ethanol and alprazolam appear to inhibit the excitability of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by an action related to the former, while buspirone probably inhibits these cells through the latter. Maintaining bovine adrenal chromaffin cells for several days in culture medium, containing inhibitory concentrations of ethanol alprazolam or buspirone, produced a marked increase in binding sites for a [3H]dihydropyridine [DHP] calcium channel antagonist, on cell membranes. The increase in binding sites produced by alprazolam was greater than that produced by the other two agents and was almost completely prevented by the concomitant presence of flumazenil. The effects of ethanol and buspirone on the binding of DHP were not prevented by flumazenil. The results suggest that drugs which decrease excitability of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by different mechanisms, may evoke a similar adaptive response involving an increase in DHP-sensitive calcium channels.", 
    "79": "In the present study, which comprised 14 patients in whom 300 mg and 900 mg of ranitidine as well as in combination with pirenzepine had failed to suppress acid secretion, we tested the effect of adding misoprostol. Night-time intragastric pH was continuously monitored, a rise in the intragastric pH above 4.0 h more than 6 h following the oral dose at 18.00 h being considered a response. In only 1 of the 7 patients with cirrhosis, and in 1 of the 7 control patients, did the combination of 300 mg ranitidine and 400 micrograms of misoprostol result in sufficient acid suppression. Mean pH profiles during the four study periods were not significantly different and the effect of misoprostol was similar in cirrhotics and controls. The inefficacy of the addition of misoprostol in this selected group of patients who did not respond even high doses of ranitidine (+/- pirenzepine) does not favour the hypothesis that gastric mucosal prostaglandin efficiency may be an important factor in the non-response to H2-receptor antagonists. It appears unlikely that the cause is localized solely at the site of H2-receptors.", 
    "80": "To suit the specific needs of various clinical situations, selection of an appropriate benzodiazepine derivative should be based on consideration of their different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Benzodiazepine derivatives that are rapidly eliminated produce the most pronounced rebound and withdrawal syndromes. Benzodiazepines that are slowly absorbed and slowly eliminated are most appropriate for the anxious patient, since these derivatives produce a gradual and sustained anxiolytic effect. Rapidly absorbed and slowly eliminated benzodiazepines are usually more appropriate for patients with sleep disturbances, since the rapid absorption induces sleep and the slower elimination rate may induce less tolerance to the sedative effect. Rational selection of a benzodiazepine for the elderly and for the suspected drug abuser is more problematic. The relevant pharmacokinetic and clinical considerations for these users are discussed. Certain derivatives may possess pharmacodynamic properties not shared by the entire benzodiazepine class; empirical studies have suggested the existence of anti-panic properties for alprazolam and clonazepam, antidepressant properties for alprazolam, and anti-manic properties for clonazepam and possibly lorazepam.", 
    "81": "Flumazenil, a potent benzodiazepine antagonist, is a newly synthetic imidazo-benzodiazepine, which blocks the neurological effects of benzodiazepines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of this agent in reversal of benzodiazepine overdose and differentiation of comatous patients with drug overdose. Fifteen comatous patients with suspected sedatives/hypnotics overdose were included in this study and flumazenil 0.25 mg per dose was administrated intravenously. The average score of Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 7.13 +/- 2.92 to 10.93 +/- 3.67 after one dose of flumazenil. Clear consciousness was restored after multiple doses of flumazenil administration. Three cases with different drug history and variant response after flumazenil treatment were also illustrated and discussed. The dosage of flumazenil used in this study ranged from 0.25 mg to 3 mg (average 0.87 +/- 0.74 mg). We concluded that flumazenil is an excellent antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and valuable for differentiating the patients in comatose.",

Of 127 consecutive patients attending the rheumatology clinic a total of 29% (37) had been taking night sedation for mean duration of 4.1 years. The majority of BDP users (92%) were women. In 78% night sedation was taken for insomnia associated with night pain. We recommend that if BDP is to be prescribed it should be only in selected cases for a short time.", 
    "83": "Clinical reports have indicated an increased risk of ocular opacities in users of phenothiazine drugs, and some recent epidemiologic studies have found an association between cataract and a history of tranquilizer use. To examine the effects of major tranquilizers (phenothiazines and haloperidol) on the risk of cataract extraction, while controlling for suspected risk factors such as diabetes and steroid use, a matched cohort study was performed using information from a large health maintenance organization in Seattle, Wash. The use of either antipsychotic or other phenothiazine drugs increased the risk of cataract extraction by roughly 3.5 times in individuals who were both current users and were exposed some time in the 2 to 5 years prior to their extraction. Risk was also increased in individuals with prior use of antidiabetic agents, systemic steroids, and benzodiazepines. Contrary to some prior reports, there was no elevated risk associated with use of antihypertensives, and there was no protective effect for aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen.", 
    "84": "Insomnias lead the list of sleep disorders in the elderly. The differential diagnosis includes poor sleep habits, medical and psychiatric disorders, and drug interactions. Effective treatment includes sleep hygiene education and avoidance of substances known to interfere with sleep. In general, anticholinergic agents, antihistamines and long-half-life benzodiazepines should be avoided as hypnotic agents in the elderly. Safer therapeutic options include relaxation therapy and the short-half-life benzodiazepines without active metabolites.", 
    "85": "The sequencing of endopeptidase-generated peptides from the peripheral binding site (PBS) for benzodiazepines, purified from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, produced internal sequence information, and confirmed and extended the NH2-terminal PBS sequence that we previously reported. Since the sequences were highly similar to the corresponding rat PBS sequences, we investigated whether they were also conserved in human PBS. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PK11195 (a derivative of isoquinoline carboxamide) binding and photoaffinity labeling with [3H]PK14105 (a nitrophenyl derivative of PK11195) revealed that CHO PBS and human PBS are closely related. Furthermore a rabbit antiserum raised against three peptides synthesized on the basis of the CHO PBS sequence immunoprecipitate the solubilized U937 PBS and also recognize the human protein in an immunoblot analysis. Based on these results, we screened a U937 cell cDNA library with four oligonucleotide probes derived from the CHO sequence. Two of the probes hybridized with several clones that we isolated and sequenced. One of these, h-pPBS11, is 831 nucleotides and contains a full-length representation of human PBS mRNA. The amino acid sequence of human PBS deduced from the cDNA is 79% identical to that reported for rat PBS, however, human PBS contains two cysteines while rat PBS is characterized by the absence of this amino acid. Using the cDNA of human PBS as a probe, the PBS gene was located in the 22q13.3 band of the human genome."
