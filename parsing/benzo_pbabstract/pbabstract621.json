    "0": "Previous data in rats indicate that while dopamine receptor blockers like haloperidol (HAL) potentiate opiate analgesia, dopamine receptor stimulants like apomorphine reduce cold-water swim (CWS) and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) analgesia. Yet recently, HAL and chlorpromazine (CBZ) have been shown to reduce heat and immobilization analgesia. To address these differences, the present study investigated whether HAL (10, 50, 100 microgram/kg) or CPZ (1, 3, 5 mg/kg) would potentiate or reduce the effects of morphine (MOR), CWS, 2-DG and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) upon analgesia and activity. While HAL increased jump thresholds in a dose-dependent manner, CPZ doses exerted erratic effects. MOR analgesia was potentiated by the two higher CPZ doses and by the highest HAL dose. 2-DG analgesia was potentiated by only the highest HAL dose while CDP analgesia was potentiated by the moderate CPZ dose. While all CPZ doses potentiated CWS-induced increases in jump thresholds, the lowest HAL dose reduced this effect. These effects are considered in terms of the analgesic manipulation and its magnitude of effect, the neuroleptic and its dose, the pain test, and possible concurrent effects upon activity.", 
    "1": "Earlier observations have shown that systematically injected minor tranquilizers decrease the aversive consequences of electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) matter of the rat brain. In order to verify if these drugs can act directly on the DPAG, chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and pentobarbital (PB) were locally injected into the dorsal midbrain of rats chronically implanted with chemitrodes, allowing electrical stimulation of the same brain area. Microinjection of doses of 0.16 and 0.32 mumol of CDP and 0.16 mumol of PB significantly increased the threshold electrical current including flight behavior by stimulating the dorsal midbrain. Flight behavior was measured by the number of times rats crossed dividing line while running from one compartment of a shuttle-box to the other. The same effect was caused by the intracerebral injection of 0.32 and 0.64 mumol of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Conversely, local injection of the GABA antagonists. bicuculline (5-20) nmol) or picrotoxin (0.3 and 0.6 nmol), into the dorsal midbrain induced flight behavior, like the electrical stimulation. On the other hand, the glycine antagonist, strychnine (40 nmol) caused convulsive behavior only, while the intracerebral injection of the cholinergic agonist, carbachol (10-40 nmol), increased locomotion, sniffing and turning behavior, but did not induce flight. Pretreatment with locally injected GABA (0.64 mumol) antagonized the aversive effect of either bicuculline (10 nmol) or picrotoxin (0.3 nmol), whereas CDP (0.32 mumol) antagonised bicuculline only and PB (0.16 mumol) was ineffective against either bicuculline or picrotoxin. These results suggest that minor tranquilizers act directly upon the DPAG by enhancing the tonic inhibitory influence of endogenous GABA. This action may underly the antiaversive affects of these drugs.", 
    "2": "Surveys indicate that the adolescent, in particular, suffers from acute anxiety in relation to dentistry. This anxiety is promoted by the general opinion they form of dentists and dentistry through portrayal by their peers and the media. In addition, their own attitude to dentistry, both positive and negative, is influenced to a large extent by the dentist himself. This patient-dentist relationship is, therefore, especially important when treating the adolescent and this should be emphasized in the dental undergraduate curriculum. Psychological methods can be effective in overcoming anxiety but they may be time-consuming. The technique of rapid induction analgesia, using hypnosis by indirect suggestion, may be the most practical modality in this field. Pharmacological techniques remain the principal method of stress reduction. The oral sedative-hypnotic of choice has progressed from the barbiturates to the benzodiazepines mainly due to the selective action of the latter on the limbic system coupled with their high therapeutic index. The newer benzodiazepines combine a more rapid onset with accelerated recovery. Nitrous oxide remains a safe and predictable agent for sedation but its ability to reinforce post-hypnotic suggestion has not been fully realized in the past. Intravenous sedation has evolved from a general anaesthetic technique to a predictable conscious sedation technique with the benzodiazepines again dominating the field. The advent of newer benzodiazepines with much shorter half-lives will improve their properties further. With the combination of the psychological and pharmacological techniques available, anxiety for the adolescent in dentistry may be overcome.", 
    "3": "Experimental nicotinic brain edema in rats was made use of to examine the action of the benzodiazepine tranquilizers, diazepam and phenazepam. It was disclosed that these agents have antiedematous properties. It is suggested that the GABA-ergic mechanisms might participate in the realization of the effect under consideration.", 
    "4": "Progabide and its immediate metabolite SL 75102 displace [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), [3H]muscimol and [3H]isoguvacine from their binding sites to membranes prepared from rat brain or human cerebellum and increase (SL 75102) [3H]flunitrazepam binding to rat cerebral cortex membranes. In contrast, these compounds have very weak or no effects on alpha or beta noradrenergic, histamine, muscarinic cholinergic or glycine receptors or on the [3H]imipramine or [3H]kainate binding sites. Neither progabide nor SL 75102 inhibit GABA synthesis, metabolism or uptake. Also, the uptake of norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine into synaptosomes of cerebral regions is not affected by progabide. [3H]GABA release from substantia nigra slices is decreased by SL 75102 and progabide, in agreement with the hypothesis of a GABAergic autoreceptor controlling GABA release from its nerve terminals. These data suggest a specific agonist action of progabide and SL 75102 on GABA receptors.", 
    "5": "1 The effects of lormetazepam and camazepam on sleep electroencephalography, visuo-motor coordination, digit symbol substitution and subjective assessments of mood and sleep quality were compared with placebo in six young adult males (18-27 years). The study was double blind. 2 Over the dose range 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg, lormetazepam increased total sleep time (P less than 0.05), reduced wakefulness (P less than 0.05) and drowsy sleep (linear effect P less than 0.05). With 2.0 mg there were increases in stage 3 (P less than 0.05) and reduction in rapid eye movement sleep (P less than 0.01). Overnight ingestion of 2.0 mg, was followed by impaired visuo-motor coordination and fewer substitutions with the digit symbol test. 3 The hypnotic effect of 10-20 mg camazepam was limited to reduced awake activity (P less than 0.05), and with 20 mg there were increased substitutions on the digit symbol test. After 40 mg overnight stage 4 sleep was reduced (P less than 0.001) and performance at the digit symbol test was impaired (P less than 0.05 at 9.75 h). Morning ingestion of 20 mg camazepam did not alter performance, and the subjects assessed themselves to be more relaxed. 4 Lormetazepam is not specially indicated for those involved in skilled activity, but may prove useful for patients with insomnia resistant to other drugs. Camazepam would appear to be a promising anxiolytic with minimal effects on performance.", 
    "6": "The effects of GABA on the binding of analogues of benzodiazepines, triazolopyridazines, beta-carbolines and imidazodiazepines were examined in ligand/[3H] flunitrazepam competition experiments. GABA increased the potency of anxiolytics, like flunitrazepam, whereas the potency of benzodiazepine antagonists, like Ro15-1788, was largely insensitive to the influence of GABA. Several other agents including pyrazolopyridines, barbiturates and etomidate caused a chloride dependent enhancement of [3H] flunitrazepam binding but not an enhancement of [3H] propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding.", 
    "7": "Several benzodiazepines were compared with dipyridamole for their ability to inhibit the nucleoside transporter specific accumulation of [3H] adenosine into guinea pig ventricle. Diazepam inhibited adenosine accumulation but was considerably less potent than dipyridamole. Lorazepam and flurazepam also inhibited accumulation, but were less potent than diazepam. Coronary vasodilation by diazepam or by dipyridamole probably is mediated via potentiation of adenosine following inhibition of the nucleoside transport system.", 
    "8": "Patients with liver disease often show unusual responses to \"standard\" doses of drugs. Increased variability of response to drugs which are predominantly eliminated by the liver is mainly due to altered pharmacokinetics in the presence of hepatic dysfunction. The possible prediction of abnormal pharmacokinetics in hepatic disease requires a knowledge of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a particular drug in healthy subjects and of the major pathophysiologic alterations which occur in a given form of liver disease. In all cases with significant impairment of the metabolic capacity of the liver (e.g. acute viral hepatitis), dosage adjustments should be based on decreased (hepatic) clearance rather than on prolongation of halflife of the respective drug. In addition, oral doses of those drugs which under normal conditions are efficiently extracted from sinusoidal blood by hepatocytes should be further reduced in chronic liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis) as marked increases in their systemic bioavailability occur in the presence of altered hepatic blood flow.", 
    "9": "In an open non-comparative clinical trial 64 patients older than 18 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists ratings of I and II were studied. Under standardized conditions of premedication, anaesthesia was induced by injecting midazolam (Ro 21-3981) 0,15 or 0,3 mg/kg body weight intravenously. After endotracheal intubation with suxamethonium 1 mg/kg, anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen and enflurane or halothane. There were statistically significant cardiovascular changes during and/or after intubation but there were no clinical consequences. Midazolam allows rapid induction of and recovery from anaesthesia. There was no retrograde amnesia and high proportion of the patients assessed the induction of anaesthesia as favourable. The local tolerance was very good. Midazolam seems to be a good alternative for induction of balanced anaesthesia.", 
    "10": "An in vitro test which discriminates benzodiazepine \"agonists' and 'antagonists' has been developed by exploiting the apparent differences in modulation of the benzodiazepine receptor by these classes of compounds. In the presence of 10 microM GABA, the potency of benzodiazepine 'agonists' (i.e., compounds which bind to the benzodiazepine receptor with a relatively high affinity and share pharmacologic properties with benzodiazepines) to displace [3H]3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline is significantly increased. In contrast, the potency of benzodiazepine 'antagonists' (compounds which have been demonstrated to antagonize some of the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines) is not altered by GABA. Several chemically diverse classes of compound have been examined in this test, and within the limited number of compounds examined, this test accurately predicts 'agonist' and 'antagonist' actions in vivo.", 
    "11": "With MS and NMR spectroscopic methods the structures of three additional by-products formed in the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of bromazepam were established. Some attention was paid to the analytical relevance of the by-products and indications are given to perform the hydrolysis in such a way that one specific product can be obtained.", 
    "12": "A screening procedure for fifteen 1,4-benzodiazepines in biological material (urine), suitable for clinical toxicology, is described. The benzodiazepines and/or their metabolites are hydrolysed to their benzophenones; after alkalinization, the benzophenones are extracted with chloroform. The extract is evaporated to dryness and the dried residue is dissolved in methanol and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column at 254 nm with methanol-water (1:1) as eluent.", 
    "13": "We examined the specific binding of [3H]CL 218,872, a novel triazolopyridazine to benzodiazepine receptors in the rat cerebral cortex. Two binding sites with KD values of about 10-30 nM and 200-600 nM were demonstrated. A number of benzodiazepine anxiolytics inhibited [3H]CL 218,872 binding in a manner which correlates with the potency of these drugs for inhibiting [3H]benzodiazepine binding. Our initial studies show that [3H]CL 218,872 can label the benzodiazepine receptors and may prove to be a useful probe for studying benzodiazepine heterogeneity and regulation.", 
    "14": "Specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding was determined for five brain regions in both sexes of the three Roman rat strains. Small strain differences and a large Sex-Region interaction were detected, benzodiazepine receptor binding being significantly higher in females in the two cortical areas and the cerebellum, but significantly lower in the striatum and hippocampus. These findings are discussed in the context of sex and strain differences in behavior and benzodiazepine sensitivity.", 
    "15": "The binding of [3H] beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester ([3H] beta-CCE), a ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor in the mammalian CNS, to rat cortical membranes, is enhanced by avermectin B1a and its therapeutic formulation, Ivermectin. In contrast to the effects of the avermectins on [3H]diazepam binding, which involve changes in both receptor affinity and number, increases in beta-CCE binding, which are much less than those observed for the benzodiazepine ligand, involve only alterations in receptor number. This Bmax increase is bicuculline insensitive whereas Ivermectin effects on benzodiazepine binding are partially antagonized by GABA antagonist. The data suggest a differential interaction by the avermectins on benzodiazepine and beta-CCE binding sites in rat cortical membranes and indicate that these macrolide anthelmintics may be a useful tool for characterizing benzodiazepine/anxiolytic receptor subtypes.", 
    "16": "Sedative dosages of the benzodiazepine, diazepam (76 micro mol/kg, i.p.), reduce the light-evoked increase in retinal dopamine turnover, while intraocular applications of the water-soluble benzodiazepine, flurazepam (0.50 or 1.0 micro mol/eyeball), produce a dose-dependent suppression of light-enhanced dopamine synthesis. These results provide the first evidence that the benzodiazepines alter a physiologically important retinal response in vivo. They also suggest that some the visual effects produced by the benzodiazepines may have an intraretinal locus of action.", 
    "17": "The interaction of barbiturates with benzodiazepine receptors was studied in extensively washed membrane preparations from rat brain. Sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic barbiturates such as pentobarbital, and convulsant barbiturates such as DMBB, enhanced [3H]diazepam binding in a stereospecific fashion. Freeze-thawing of membranes resulted in a decrease in the potency of barbiturates to enhance [3H]diazepam binding, while the maximum response to barbiturates remained unchanged. Significant differences in both the potency and maximum enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding by pentobarbital was observed among brain regions. The rank order potency of pentobarbital in different brain regions was: cerebellum greater than cortex greater than hippocampus, while the rank order efficacy of pentobarbital in these brain regions was reversed. The effects of a combination of anesthetic and/or convulsant barbiturates on [3H]diazepam binding suggested that these compounds function as partial agonists while a combination of anesthetic or convulsant barbiturates with phenobarbital suggested that latter compound antagonized the actions of both anesthetic and convulsant barbiturates. The convulsant benzodiazepine Ro-5-3663 and inosine were more potent as inhibitors of pentobarbital-enhanced than basal (non-pentobarbital enhanced) [3H]diazepam binding. Solubilization of benzodiazepine receptors with Lubrol-PX resulted in a complete loss of barbiturate enhanced [3H]diazepam binding, and greater than a 75% loss in efficacy in the remaining (insoluble receptor) tissue. These data, coupled with recent observations from this and other laboratories, suggests that the site(s) at which barbiturates act to enhance [3H]diazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors is distinct from the site at which GABA acts to enhance [3H]diazepam binding. The phenomenon of enhanced benzodiazepine binding by barbiturates may be related to the depressant actions of the barbiturates, that is, their direct effects to increase chloride conductance. Although it is premature to assign a pharmacologic correlate to this neurochemical phenomenon, it appears that this action may be related to the anesthetic effects of the barbiturates. However, the definitive assignment of either the electrophysiologic or pharmacologic sequelae to this neurochemical action will require further investigation.", 
    "18": "First experiences with Midazolam during parturition of 109 women show that this drug can help to ease delivery by psychical and muscular relaxation. This results also in a shorter length of the delivery period. Midazolam has a half-life of about two hours and can be applied simultaneously with oxytocin by motor driven syringe. Therefore, the application can be well controlled; and the placenta transfer is small. No fetal or maternal side-effect could be observed other than restricted undulatory amplitudes of the cardiotocogram. Midazolam itself does not exhibit analgetic action, but its application allows to break through the circulus vitiosus anxiety-tension-pain. This results in a reduction of breath depressing analgetics such as Pethidin.", 
    "19": "Apomorphine-induced hyperthermia in the rabbit was shown to be dependent upon the presence of stressors. Two types of stressors were used: 1) a physical stressor, foot shock; and 2) an emotional stressor, conditioned fear. Apomorphine (4 mg/kg i.v.), in the absence of a stressor, produced behavioral responses of arousal, stereotypic gnawing and hind foot thumping. Foot shock, which in control animals exerted no temperature effects, when paired with apomorphine administration, produced a hyperthermic response of 1.3 degrees C. This hyperthermia was abolished by pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg i.v.) or haloperidol (50 micrograms/kg i.v.). Classical conditioning was used to provide the emotional stressor and was accomplished by pairing a tone with foot shock. After conditioning the tone combined with apomorphine produced an increase in temperature of 1.3 degrees C, whereas the tone paired with saline (1 ml/kg i.v.) produced no hyperthermia. An intensity vs. effect curve was determined, and foot shock alone elicited increases of temperature in a dose-dependent manner. At a given shock intensity, apomorphine elicited a much greater response than shock alone and also decreased the threshold for response to shock. Our findings firmly establish the hypothesis that apomorphine elicits hyperthermia in the presence of stressors by increasing sensitivity and decreasing the threshold for response to stressors.", 
    "20": "The effect of unilateral eye extirpation on the development of the chick optic tectum has been studied in both the embryo and the newly hatched chick. Although the prevention of normal afferentation of the embryonic tectum retarded its growth, there appeared to be a significant increase of muscarinic acetylcholine binding site in the noninnervated tectum. This phenomenon was repeated also in the posthatch denervated system wherein the functioning optic nerve is severed. A significant increase in the number of binding sites as well as reduced dissociation constant of the interactions of this receptor with [3H]quinuclindinyl benzilate was found in the deafferented optic tectum. This may suggest the presence of a denervation-supersensitivity-like modulation. Similar increases were not detected with other binding sites studied in either the noninnervated embryonic or deafferented posthatch optic lobes. The possibility that acetylcholine is a primary neurotransmitter of the optic system is discussed.", 
    "21": "The kindling effect of the hippocampus was investigated in rats. The development of behavioral manifestations in hippocampal kindling was similar to that seen in the case of amygdaloid kindling, but many more stimulations were required to evoke behavioral convulsions in the former. The transfer phenomenon from amygdala to hippocampus was evident. There were no differences in effects of drugs on the seizure-discharge and the behavioral convulsions between the amygdaloid and the hippocampal kindled rats. The present results suggest that the amygdala plays an important role in the formation of hippocampal kindling, especially in the manifestation of behavioral changes. The hippocampal kindled rat, as well as amygdaloid kindled rat, is useful animal model for evaluating the antiepileptic effect of various drugs.", 
    "22": "The glucuronidation of morphine was investigated in kidney microsomes from human foetuses. This reaction was found to be catalyzed in all specimens investigated and the UDP-glucuronyltransferase activities varied between 0.18 and 0.30 nmol per min. per mg microsomal protein. Intraindividual comparisons with the hepatic glucuronidation rates revealed the renal enzyme rate to be about 50 percent of the hepatic. Oxazepam, and to a lesser extent salicylamide, inhibited the glucuronidation of morphine in kidney microsomes in similarity to what previously was shown in human foetal liver microsomes.", 
    "23": "The antidotal effect of physostigmine in a dose of 1 mg and 2 mg was investigated in 44 patients after diazepam-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. The degree of recovery was estimated using the Bender Motor Gestalt test, the post-operative recovery scores, the changes in hand force, and the cerebral function monitor (CFM) trace. Diazepam plasma levels were also determined. The improvement in the patients' alertness assessed by psychomotoric tests and the CFM trace was significant, but the recovery of the vital functions measured by the recovery scores (PARS) was marginal. Thus the indications for physostigmine in the treatment of postoperative somnolence induced by diazepam-nitrous oxide are relative and only in grave oversedation with diazepam can physostigmine be recommended as an antidote.", 
    "24": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) in extinction and punishment-conflict tasks were examined in rats after neonatal systemic administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to deplete forebrain norepinephrine (NE). At about 70 days of age the rats were water deprived and trained for three days to drink in a novel apparatus. On the fourth day (test day) drinking was either extinguished by elimination of water from the drinking tube or punished by lick-contingent shock. Just prior to this test session half of the vehicle and half of the 6-OHDA treated rats were given an injection of CDZ (8 mg/kg IP). Both the injection of CDZ and forebrain NE depletion prolonged responding during extinction and reduced the suppressant effects of punishment in male rats, and these effects were of similar magnitude. Furthermore, CDZ was as effective in neonatal 6-OHDA treated male rats as in vehicle treated rats indicating that decreased transmission is ascending NE fibers caused by CDZ is not solely responsible for its behavioral effects in extinction and conflict tasks. Rather, these effects may involve cooperative mediation by both noradrenergic and serotonergic forebrain terminals. Unexpectedly, CDZ's anti-extinction effect was absent in female rats and its anti-conflict effect observed only in NE depleted females.", 
    "25": "Midazolam was given intravenously to 100 children over the age of 8 years to induce anaesthesia and a similar control group was anaesthetised with diazepam. The actions of midazolam in children were found to be similar to those of diazepam. Midazolam acted more quickly in children than has been reported in adults. The effects on the circulation and respiration, and the incidence of postoperative amnesia were similar in children to that which has been reported in adults. The incidence of postoperative vomiting after midazolam was 1% in the recovery room and 32% during the first two postoperative days. Laboratory investigations did not demonstrate any adverse effects. Midazolam has a considerable advantage over diazepam being water soluble and injectable safely without dilution. This clinical trial suggests that midazolam is a satisfactory induction agent for children.", 
    "26": "The principles of clinical pharmacokinetics of intravenous and inhalation anaesthesia and the correlation with pharmacodynamics are reviewed with special reference to the commonly used anaesthetic agents. Pharmacokinetics is regarded mainly as an aid towards optimization of dosage. Dosage rules based on pharmacokinetic principles, for repeated administration and infusion are outlined for the induction, maintenance and termination of anaesthesia. Interindividual variations and biological disposition are not taken into account. The kinetic processes common to intravenous and inhalation anaesthesia are presented in the form of a multiexponential function for constant concentrations.", 
    "27": "The development of a specific high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay, having a quantitative detection limit of 0.4 microgram/ml, is described for plasma indocyanine green. In a preliminary study, the HPLC method demonstrated that te traditional spectrophotometric procedure inaccurately quantitates the dye's degradation in aqueous medium since degradation products that absorb light at 770- nm are formed. In a further study, the spectrophotometric method yielded an erroneously low clearance of indocyanine green in the rabbit. In addition, the HPLC assay points to the possibility of metabolite formation of the dye in vivo.", 
    "28": "In animals, self-administration procedures have been used to assess reinforcing properties of drugs and predict abuse liability. In humans, subjective effect have been used. In the present studies, there two approaches were combined in human subjects. During the first four sessions of a nine-session experiment, subjects were given opportunities to ingest two drugs. After ingestion, subjects were free to leave. Mood questionnaires were filled out before ingestion and 1, 3, and 6 h later. During the last five sessions, subjects chose which drug to ingest. In study I, subjects chose 5 mg d-amphetamine over placebo. Subjective effects were typical of amphetamines but were not correlated with amount of amphetamine preference. In study II this same comparison was repeated three times. The preference for amphetamine decreased but subjective effects did not change. In study III, subjects tended to prefer 5 mg d-amphetamine to 20 mg fenfluramine. Subjective effects after amphetamine were similar to those in study I but those after fenfluramine did not differ from placebo. In study IV, subjects preferred placebo to 5 or 10 mg diazepam. The subjective effects of diazepam were typical of sedatives. These results indicate that drug self-administration procedures with humans can be useful for testing abuse liability and that subjective measures do not always correlate with drug preference.", 
    "29": "Pressure sore are caused by multiple mechanisms. Preventive management requires relief of pressure, skin care, control of spasms, release of contractures and treatment of infection. Conservative treatment succeeds only when pressure on the ulcer site is relieved. Surgical treatment involves primary, secondary and tertiary procedures. Benefits of surgical closure include avoidance of protein loss, prevention of osteomyelitis and other infections, improved appearance and prevention of carcinoma and amyloidosis. A coordinated team approach, incorporating patient education, is effective.", 
    "30": "A 73-year-old woman with no previous psychiatric history received clonazepam maintenance therapy for essential blepharospasm. Visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations as well as paranoid delusions were documented. Dose reduction resulted in complete disappearance of the hallucinations and reduction of paranoia to an acceptable level, with no exacerbation during the subsequent 12 months. To our knowledge, this is the first well documented report of psychosis induced by clonazepam. Psychosis was probably related to clonazepam-induced increased central nervous system serotonin and possible predisposition to organic brain syndrome by undocumented causes. Dose reduction is suggested as an alternative to discontinuing the drug when hallucinations or paranoia arise during clonazepam therapy, if no other satisfactory treatment is available and if adequate patient monitoring and protection exist.", 
    "31": "Four methadone-maintained subjects were given diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) for 9 days. During the dual drug period, the effects and kinetics of methadone and of its major pyrrolidine metabolite were not altered. These findings indicate that, unlike its effects in rodents, diazepam does not inhibit the metabolism of methadone in man.", 
    "32": "The peripheral and central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory effects of midazolam 0.15 mg/kg, administered intravenously, were studied in 57 patients. Midazolam induced anaesthesia satisfactorily in 78% of the patients, the remainder required either further doses of midazolam, or alternative induction agents. There was no pain on injection. No evidence of thrombophlebitis was apparent up to 72 hours after injection. Mean systolic arterial pressure decreased from 128 mm Hg to 114 mm Hg and mean diastolic pressure decreased from 75 mm Hg to 67 mm Hg (P less than 0.005) four minutes after injection. Mean Apnoea occurred in 14 patients, with a mean onset time of 82 sec and a mean duration of 30 sec. Patients showed a decrease in mean respiratory rate from 13.7 breaths/min to 12.8 breaths/min two minutes after injection of midazolam. A larger dose than used in this study would be necessary for satisfactory use of midazolam as an induction agent for general anaesthesia.", 
    "33": "The effects of conscious sedation on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of seven healthy volunteers were studied. With mean dosages of meperidine, 0.41 mg/kg, diazepam, 0.13 mg/kg, and methohexital titrated incrementally to effect, there were statistically significant changes in PaO2, PaCO2, and arterial blood pH, and no statistically significant change in cardiac output as determined by arterial blood gas analysis and impedance cardiac output monitoring. No clinically significant changes were observed in cardiorespiratory function, and all patients were conscious according to the definition proposed by the American Dental Society of Anesthesiology. The variation in PaO2 showed only marginal statistical significance. There was no clinical indication for supplemental oxygen.", 
    "34": "Rat isolated hearts with the sympathetic nerves attached were perfused with (-)-3H-noradrenaline in order to label the storage vesicles of the adrenergic nerves. Release was induced either by electrical stimulation of the nerves (3 Hz, 1 min) or by perfusion with high K+ solution (54 mM). The overflow of 3H-noradrenaline and its metabolites was determined by liquid scintillation counting after separation of the compounds by column chromatography. The experimental conditions ensured a minor contribution of 3H-metabolites to the evoked total tritium overflow. The release of 3H-noradrenaline evoked by nerve stimulation or high K+ solution was decreased in the presence of the muscarinic agonist, methacholine, N-methylatropine reversed the inhibition completely. Thus, the rat heart contains inhibitory muscarine receptors modulating noradrenaline release from adrenergic nerve fibres. In order to compare the presynaptic muscarine receptors with postsynaptic muscarine receptors in one and the same organ, the pA2 values of N-methylatropine and pirenzepine at both of these sites were measured. The antagonism of methacholine-induced inhibition of 3H-noradrenaline overflow was determined as the presynaptic parameter. pA2 values of 9.61 for N-methylatropine and 6.63 for pirenzepine were found. The methacholine-induced inhibition of the atrial tension development of isolated left rat atria paced at 2Hz was measured as a postsynaptic parameter. pA2 values of 9.90 for N-methylatropine and 6.69 for pirenzepine were found. The postsynaptic pA2 values did not differ from the presynaptic affinity constants indicating that neither substance revealed differences in structure between neuronal and myocardial muscarine receptors in the rat heart.", 
    "35": "Patients suffering from manic-depressive psychosis, manic type (ICD 296.0), were treated with lithium carbonate and randomly allocated to two groups, one received digoxin and the other matching placebo for 7 days. Severity of mania was rated by psychiatrists on the Manic Rating Scale and Analogue Line on days 0 and 7 and by nurses daily on the Hargreaves Rating Scale, Psychotic Rating. Fourteen patients received digoxin and lithium carbonate and 14 patients received placebo and lithium carbonate. Improvement in the placebo lithium group was significantly greater than that in the digoxin lithium group. This trial suggests, therefore, that the effect of inhibition of membrane cation carrier is to reduce the response to lithium. This result is in keeping with our hypothesis that an increase in Na-K ATPase is essential to the therapeutic effect of lithium carbonate. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that the observations resulted from the inhibition by digoxin of lithium entry into the brain.", 
    "36": "The benzodiazepine/GABA (gammaaminobutyric acid) receptor complex was investigated during severe ethanol intoxication and withdrawal in the rat. The intragastric intubation technique was used to establish physical ethanol dependence in the animals. Cerebral cortex from male Wistar rats was studied 1) after 3 1/2 days of severe ethanol intoxication, 2) during the ethanol withdrawal reaction and 3) in a control group. The effect of GABA-ergic activation by muscimol and THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazole(5,4-c)pyridin-3-01) on 3H-diazepam binding was unchanged during ethanol intoxication and withdrawal, as was the affinity constant (KD) and the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) for 3H-flunitrazepam. In conclusion, the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex is unlikely to play any causal part in physical ethanol dependence.", 
    "37": "Characteristics of receptor binding of diazepam and flunitrazepam in three brain areas were compared. It was found that in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum the number of sites was similar for both ligands and that the affinity of diazepam was four times lower than the affinity of flunitrazepam. In contrast, when binding in the hippocampus was analyzed (assuming the presence of homogeneous binding sites), it was found that the number of binding sites was higher and that the affinity was 17 times lower for diazepam than for flunitrazepam. This difference is due to the presence of two diazepam binding sites in this brain area, as demonstrated by a Scatchard analysis.", 
    "38": "Esters of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid have recently been identified as potent inhibitors of brain benzodiazepine receptors in vitro. Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE), however, is a rather weak inhibitor in vivo of benzodiazepine receptors in mice. The ED50-value was 91 mg/kg intraperitoneally 35 min after administration (ED50 is that dose which inhibits by 50% the specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam intravenously). ED50 for beta-CCE was 2-20 fold lower in mice pretreated with organophosphorus esterase inhibitors, concomitantly with the observation of strong inhibition of liver and kidney hydrolyzing activity, using 3H-propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate as substrate. The rat brain contains only approximately 0.1% of the hydrolyzing activity as compared to the liver. It is concluded that some esters of beta-carboline-3-carboxylate exhibit only weak effects on benzodiazepine receptors in living animals due to hydrolysis outside the brain.", 
    "39": "When the benzodiazepine receptor in mouse cerebellar, striatal, and hippocampal membranes was photoaffinity labeled with nonradioactive flunitrazepam, specific [3H]diazepam binding determined with either unlabeled diazepam or ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (betaCCE) as displacer declined greater than 80%. In contrast, specific propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (PrCC) binding in these regions determined with betaCCE as displacer was basically unaltered after photolabeling. Photolabeling lowered specific [3H]PrCC binding with diazepam as displacer to an intermediate extent in the three regions. In cerebellum photolabeling had little effect on either the Kd or Bmax for specific [3H]PrCC binding determined with betaCCE as displacer but significantly lowered the Bmax for specific [3H]PrCC binding determined with diazepam as displacer. These results do not support the idea that [3H]PrCC and [3H]diazepam have a common recognition site on the benzodiazepine receptor. Instead, they suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor is a multicomponent complex.", 
    "40": "The correlation between the development of barbital (B)-withdrawal signs and alterations in the metabolism of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was studied. Barbital (B)-dependent rats were prepared by the B-Admixed Food method (DAF method). The B-dependent rats were grouped according to the following 5 states: G-I, B-dependent state; G-II, B-withdrawn state; G-III, cross-administration of nitrazepam (NZP) following B-withdrawal; G-IV, cross-administration of chlorpromazine (CPZ) following B-withdrawal; and G-V, cross-administration of phenytoin following B-withdrawal. The controls were comprised of naive rats (G-VI) and naive rats dosed in the same manner as the dependent rats. The brain 5-HT synthesis rate and the brain 5-hydraxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) elimination were measured at 44 to 48 hr after B-withdrawal in all groups (when withdrawal convulsion was still persisting in the B-withdrawn rats of the G-II group). The brain 5-HT synthesis rate was elevated significantly (P less than 0.001) in the rats with persistent B-withdrawal convulsion (G-II) as compared with that in the B-dependent rats (G-I). Cross-administration of nitrazepam caused the elevation of 5-HT synthesis rate with B-withdrawal to be inhibited to the dependent level in parallel with the inhibition of B-withdrawal signs. On the other hand, CPZ and phenytoin, which inhibit B-withdrawal convulsion slightly, failed to recover completely the 5-HT turnover rate during B-withdrawal. From these results, it is obvious that the elevation of the brain 5-HT synthesis rate with B-withdrawal plays an important role in eliciting B-withdrawal convulsion.", 
    "41": "The short-acting hypnotic, triazolam 0.5 mg, was compared in a 7-day double-blind study with the longer acting drug, nitrazepam 5 mg. Of the 60 patients enrolled, 29 in each drug treatment group completed the study and were evaluated. All significant differences found favoured triazolam. On the first night, triazolam was found to be significantly more effective than nitrazepam in inducing and maintaining sleep and in increasing its overall duration. The patients' subjective preference, reflecting the depth of sleep experienced and the effect of the medication, reached highly significant levels in favour of triazolam. Later in the study the differences between the drugs disappeared although the depth of sleep as judged in the study was better with triazolam.", 
    "42": "Acute administration of alprazolam and diazepam (50 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increased benzodiazepine receptors in distilled water-washed rat brain membrane preparation. Similar effects were not observed when rat brain membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Results are discussed with respect to solubilization of benzodiazepine receptors in distilled water.", 
    "43": "Fifty primigravidae were given either lorazepam (2 mg) or identical dummy tablets in early labour, in a randomized double-blind fashion. Analgesia (standardized at pethidine 100 mg) was given as required, and pain relief was assessed by visual analogue scale. Analgesia was significantly better in those mothers who had received lorazepam. There was a higher incidence of respiratory depression at birth in the infants in this group, although this was not statistically significant. Patients given lorazepam were all satisfied with their analgesic regimen compared with half of those given an inactive tablet. There was a higher incidence of amnesia for labour in the active group. There is a need for a similar study of the effects of other drugs which are given to supplement pethidine in labour.", 
    "44": "Ten healthy volunteers received single 2-mg doses of lorazepam on five occasions in random sequence. Modes of administration were: A, intravenous injection; B, deltoid intramuscular injection; C, oral tablets in the fasting state; D, sublingual dosage of oral tablets in the fasting state; and E, sublingual dosage of specially formulated tablets in the fasting state. Kinetic variables were determined from multiple plasma lorazepam concentrations measured during 48 hr postdose. After intravenous lorazepam, mean (+/- SE) values were: elimination half-life (t 1/2 beta), 12.9 (+/- 0.8) hr; volume of distribution, 1.3 (+/- 0.07) liters/kg; total clearance, 1.21 (+/- 0.1) ml/min/kg. Absorption of intramuscular lorazepam was rapid. Peak plasma levels were reached at 1.15 hr after dosage, with absorption half-life averaging 14.2 (+/- 4.7) min. Absorption or oral and sublingual lorazepam tended to be less rapid than intramuscular injection, although differences were not significant. Times of peak concentration were 2.37, 2.35, and 2.25 hr postdose for trials C,D, and E, respectively; values of absorption half-life were 32.5, 28.5, and 28.7 min. Absolute systemic availability for trials B, C, D, and E averaged 95.9, 99.8, 94.1, and 98.2%, respectively; none of these differed significantly from 100%. Values of t1/2 beta were highly replicable within individuals regardless of the administration route. Thus, sublingual lorazepam is completely absorbed and is a suitable administration route in clinical practice.", 
    "45": "The effect of antacid on steady-state plasma desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) concentrations during long-term treatment with clorazepate dipotassium (CZP) was evaluated in 10 subjects. Each took 7.5 mg CZP nightly for 30 consecutive nights divided into three 10-day treatments given in random sequence as follows: (1) 7.5 mg CZP nightly with no antacid, (2) CZP nightly for 30 ml Maalox, and (3) CZP nightly with Maalox with an additional 30 ml Maalox three times daily. The overall mean steady-state DMDZ plasma level, measured during the last 3 days of each treatment condition, was 175 ng/ml. Within-day means ranged from 159 to 202 ng/ml and were not influenced by treatment condition, time, or trial sequence. DMDZ washout after termination of the 30-day trial was slow, proceeding with a half-life of 75 hr (range, 63 to 109 hr). Thus, Maalox does not alter steady-state DMDZ levels during long-term CZP therapy.", 
    "46": "Lorazepam, 4 mg, was evaluated in an 18-night sleep-laboratory study involving five insomniac subjects. Hypnotic effectiveness and effects on sleep stages and related parameters were assessed. Placebo was given on baseline nights 1 to 4, lorazepam on nights 5 to 11, and placebo was given again on withdrawal nights 12 to 18. Subjective and objective data clearly demonstrated that lorazepam was effective for both inducing and maintaining sleep. Sleep latency was reduced from a baseline value of 34.6 min to 17.9 min (P less than 0.01) and total wake time was reduced from 75.9 to 38.5 min (P less than 0.01). On the third and fifth nights of drug withdrawal total wake time rose above baseline levels (termed rebound insomnia) and sleep latency increased by 77% and 60% over baseline (P less than 0.01). Subjective estimates of daytime anxiety also increased above baseline (rebound anxiety) during the withdrawal period. All subjects experienced severe hangover and varying degrees of impaired functioning during the first 3 days on drug. Three subjects also experienced anterograde amnesia during the day after the first drug night. These side effects diminished in intensity over the course of the study. Our results suggest that while 4 mg lorazepam may be effective in inducing and maintaining sleep, this dose induces clinically significant side effects that are followed by consistent rebound phenomena after withdrawal.",

    "48": "CGS 8216 is a novel nonbenzodiazepine that inhibited 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FLU) binding to rat synaptosomal membranes in vitro at subnanomolar concentrations. It prevented the in vivo labeling of brain benzodiazepine receptors by 3H-FLU with the same potency as diazepam when given orally to mice. Pharmacologic tests showed that it was devoid of benzodiazepine-like activity but it antagonized the actions of diazepam in these tests. It did not interact with alpha- or beta- adrenergic, H1-histaminergic or GABA receptors but it inhibited adenosine-activation of cyclic AMP formation. Studies with 3H-CGS 8216 demonstrated that it bound specifically and with high affinity to rat forebrain membranes and was displaced by drugs with an order of potencies similar to that observed when 3H-diazepam and 3H-FLU were used as radioligands. The regional distribution of 3H-CGS 8216 binding sites in the brain was also similar to that of 3H-FLU. Dissociation of 3H-CGS 8216 binding was slow at 0 degrees C but increased with temperature and was almost complete within 1 min at 37 degrees C. Scatchard analyses were linear, yielding KD values of 0.044, 0.11 and 0.18 nM at 0, 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively; the Bmax value did not change appreciably with temperature and was approximately 1000 fmoles/mg protein. Using 3H-FLU, the value for Bmax as well as for the KD increased with temperature. The total number of binding sites determined for 3H-FLU was greater than that for 3H-CGS 8216 at each temperature. CGS 8216 exhibited mixed-type inhibition of 3H-FLU binding. GABA did not stimulate 3H-CGS 8216 binding whereas it enhanced 3H-FLU binding. CGS 8216 may be a useful ligand for probing the antagonist properties of the benzodiazepine receptor and is likely to exhibit interesting therapeutic effects.", 
    "49": "The specific binding of 3H-diazepam in the cerebral cortex was investigated in membrane preparations from 6 and 30 month old Fisher-344 rats. No age-related differences in the association, equilibrium, or dissociation, binding characteristics were observed. The increased sensitivity of the elderly to the central sedative effects of the benzodiazepines does not, therefore, appear to involve changes in binding to the receptor site located in the cortex.", 
    "50": "Landauer (Med J Aust, 1981; 1: 624-626) contended that diazepam medication should not preclude car driving, since it relieves anxiety, aggression and depression. There is no clear evidence that diazepam's therapeutic effect improves driving. The bulk of evidence suggests that diazepam is harmful to driving ability even in appropriate patient populations. The detrimental effects of alcohol on driving ability are also exacerbated by diazepam. I would recommend that patients taking diazepam should avoid driving, especially if they have taken any alcohol.", 
    "51": "GTP decreases the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to cerebral cortical membrane sites. Scatchard analysis data show that GTP does not alter the maximum binding sites (Bmax), but increases the dissociation constant (KD) for [3H]flunitrazepam. GTP also inhibits the specific binding of the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]CGS-8216. The specific binding of [3H]CGS-8216 displaceable by clonazepam is inhibited to a greater extent by GTP than that displaceable by the benzodiazepine antagonists, CGS-8216 or beta-CCE.", 
    "52": "The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Cl- ion, and their combination were examined on the affinity for the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor of various ligands including BDZ's, putative endogenous ligands, and CL218872. When the binding was performed at 0 degrees, the ligands could be classified into four types according to the action of the modulators. The affinity of the first type including some BDZ's increased with GABA, Cl- ion, or their combination while that of the second type consisting of 3-hydroxy-benzodiazepines, CL218872, and inosine increased only with GABA. In the third type, designated as the beta-carboline type, only Cl- ion increased the affinity of the ligands. The fourth inactive type included pentylenetetrazole and nicotinamide and the affinities of these ligands were not affected by GABA or Cl- ion. At 37 degrees, although GABA still retained the property to increase the affinity of prototype compounds of the first and second types, the effect of C1- ion became somewhat ambiguous. Comparison of the present results with published data on the pharmacological and electrophysiological activities of the ligands suggested that the compounds with affinity increased by GABA act as BDZ-mimetics, while those belonging to types 3 and 4 act as antagonists. Also, our results seem to throw some additional light upon the relationships among the benzodiazepine receptor, the GABA receptor, and the chloride ionophore.", 
    "53": "The effect of pirenzepine and cimetidine on healing, symptoms, and relapse rate of duodenal ulcer was studied in a placebo controlled double blind trial. With regard to symptoms, cimetidine (1 g daily) was superior at the beginning of therapy to a low dose of pirenzepine (75 mg daily) and to placebo. No significant differences in ulcer healing were found between the 3 treatment groups. The relapse rate after treatment with pirenzepine was lower than after treatment with cimetidine.", 
    "54": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mammalian brain, is synthesised by gut bacteria. In a rabbit model the development of hepatic encephalopathy was associated with increased levels of GABA in plasma, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, increased numbers of binding-sites for GABA and benzodiazepines in the brain, and a pattern of neural activity similar to that induced by drugs which activate the GABA neurotransmitter system. It is postulated that in liver failure gut-derived GABA passes through a permeable blood-brain barrier and induces its own receptors in the brain, that gut-derived GABA contributes to the neural inhibition of hepatic encephalopathy, and that an increased number of drug-binding sites mediates enhanced sensitivity to barbiturates and benzodiazepines in liver failure.", 
    "55": "[(3)H]Muscimol binding at 23 degrees C and muscimol stimulated [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding at 37 degrees C to membranes of rat cerebral cortex have been investigated. In washed membrane preparations, 2 apparent populations of [(3)H]muscimol binding sites can be observed. At 23 degrees C [(3)H]muscimol binding is more sensitive to inhibition by NaCl and by other salts than at 0 degrees C. The CNS depressants etazolate and pentobarbital reversibly enhance [(3)H]muscimol binding and they increase the affinity of muscimol as a stimulator of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding. Conversely the CNS convulsants picrotoxin, picrotoxinin and isopropylbicyclophosphate (IPTBO) reversibly interfere with [(3)H]muscimol binding when NaCl is present and these drugs antagonize the effects of etazolate. In the presence of NaCl, picrotoxin, picrotoxinin and IPTBO also decrease the apparent affinity of muscimol or GABA as stimulator of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding. Binding of [(3)H]muscimol to GABA recognition sites of rat cerebral cortex is enhanced by Ag(+), Hg(+) and Cu(2+) in ?M concentrations, Ag(+) being most potent. The effects of 100 ?M AgNO(3) persist after repeated washing of the membranes. When membranes are pretreated with AgNO(3) only one apparent population of [(3)H]muscimol binding sites with high affinity (K(d): 6-8 nM) is found. In AgNO(3) pretreated membranes, the affinity of muscimol as stimulator of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding is increased 18 times (EC(50) 14 nM) when compared to control membranes, (EC(50) 253 nM). In AgNO(3) pretreated membranes, etazolate, pentobarbital and IPTBO fail to perturb either [(3)H]muscimol binding or baseline and muscimol stimulated [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding. The results demonstrate that the apparent sensitivity of GABA binding sites of the GABA-benzodiazepine-picrotoxin receptor complex can be increased by etazolate and pentobarbital and decreased by picrotoxin and IPTBO. These drugs have in common that they interfere with [(3)H]dihydropicrotoxinin binding.", 
    "56": "1. Sixteen human volunteers were administered 5mg of valium or placebo on 2 visits to the laboratory. 2. Their performance in a letter matching task was studied when it was self-paced and when externally-paced by the experimenter. 3. Self-paced performance was affected by the diazepam especially in letter matches by name. 4. This supported Mirsky and Kornetsky's conclusion (1964) rather than Frowein and Sanders (1978) recent findings.", 
    "57": "1. Stimulus control was established in rats with 600 mg/kg ethanol and saline by employing a two-lever response choice task and an FR10 schedule of food reinforcement. 2. Once trained, rats were tested with lower doses of ethanol (300-525 mg/kg) and with chlordiazepoxide (1.25-5.0 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.32-1.25 mg/kg). The highest doses of each of these treatments were observed to produce ethanol-like responding and decreasing doses produced dose-related effects upon discriminative performance. 3. The ED50 for ethanol was 300 mg/kg, for chlordiazepoxide, 1.20 mg/kg and for diazepam, 0.55 mg/kg. 4. Graphic representation of the dose-response relationships suggested that these anxiolytics share a common site and/or mechanism of action that differs from that of ethanol.", 
    "58": "1. This report describes two cases of psychotic syndrome from benztropine (Cogentin), which was used to treat haloperidol-induced extrapyramidal side effects. The patients' symptomatology meets DSM III criteria for delirium. Both patients displayed repetitive motor automatisms (stereotypy). 2. Symptomatology appeared one-to-two days after the start of benztropine 2 mg b.i.d. and subsided one-to-several days after benztropine was stopped. Treatment consisted of administration of sedative hypnotic drugs. 3. The literature on anticholinergic-induced psychotic syndromes is surveyed. Particular attention is drawn to the occurrence of stereotypy. 4. It is proposed, on the basis of a review of animal and clinical data, that stereotypies in delirious patients are related to muscarinic blockade in the central nervous system. This model is used to explain repetitive motor automatisms which are seen in Alzheimer's disease. 5. The paper concludes with brief guidelines for the management of anticholinergic delirium.", 
    "59": "The effects of drug addiction in perinatal period and its clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic problems have been considered. The authors reported five cases of newborns from addicted mothers. Neurologic symptoms were present in all cases, gastro-intestinal disturbances were present in two newborns. One presented with convulsions and died for severe hyaline membrane disease. One newborn was small for gestational age and one was premature. Treatment has been carried out successfully with diazepam and/or phenobarbital in four cases. The authors stress the importance for a careful methadone program during pregnancy in order to reduce prematurity and neurologic sequelae of the narcotic withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "60": "Following application of Silentan coated tablets (a combination of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, diazepam and dihydroergotamine (DHE) tartrate) in six healthy male volunteers serum concentrations were determined. The estimated relative bioavailabilities of these substances in the commercially available drug were compared to the encapsulated single substances. For acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine there were nearly no differences to be observed. Significant differences of the relative bioavailabilities are shown by Silentan-diazepam (= 118%) and Silentan-DHE-tartrate (= 310%) in comparison with the standard encapsulated preparations.", 
    "61": "We studied the effects of prenatal treatment with phenytoin (PHT) on the functional development of the rat brain. Pregnant rats were injected with varying doses (10, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg) of PHT on days 1-21, 1-10, 14-21 or day 15 of pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the sleeping effect of pentobarbital, ataxic effect of diazepam, or seizure effect of pentetrazol between control-F1 and PHT-F1 rats. Prenatal treatment with PHT on days 1-21 of pregnancy induced a marked increase in the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the male and female F1 rats when tested once a week, beginning on the 9th week and until the 13th week after birth. Hypersensitivity to haloperidol was induced to a greater extent in females. On the other hand, prenatal treatment with PHT on days 14-21 or on day 15 of pregnancy induced a decline in the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in both male and female F1 rats. There was no significant alteration in the growth of the PHT-F1 rats. However, their eye opening was accelerated. The present results suggest that prenatal exposure to phenytoin induces long-lasting alterations in the dopaminergic and/or other neurons related to the manifestation of cataleptic behavior in the rat brain.", 
    "62": "The potential of zopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotic, to induce physical dependence in normal human volunteers was investigated. 9 male subjects (age range 21-39 years) participated in a 56-day double-blind study with random assignment to initial treatment A or B: (A) zopiclone 7.5 mg p.o. nightly for 21 days followed by placebo for 7 days, and (B) placebo nightly for 21 days followed by placebo for 7 days. Heart rate, blood pressure, hand tremor and auditory-evoked EEG were repeatedly measured during the withdrawal periods. No differences in any of these variables between phases were found (beta = 0.90 for mean differences of 16% between phases). Subjects slept longer (mean 28 min, p less than 0.013) on zopiclone than on placebo. Symptoms of state anxiety were greater on days 2 and 4 after discontinuing zopiclone compared to all other withdrawal days (p less than 0.0021). The mean relative increase on days 2 and 4 was 30%. Sleep depth (self-rating scale) was no deeper on drug than on placebo, but during the withdrawal phases, sleep was less deep on days 2 and 4 of withdrawal from zopiclone compared to all other withdrawal days (p less than 0.0001). Subjects were unable to identify the pattern of drug administration on withdrawal, and none reported important symptoms. Discontinuation of zopiclone (7.5 mg for 21 days) is associated with detectable increase in state anxiety and lighter sleep on days 2 and 4 of withdrawal. Quantitatively, similar changes occur with other hypnotic drugs of relatively low dependence liability.", 
    "63": "The new non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, zopiclone, was investigated as a preanaesthetic medication in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy patients scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery. Initially a dose-finding study was conducted in which zopiclone 3.75 mg, 7.5, and 11.25 mg was compared with diazepam 10 mg and placebo; 7.5 mg was established as the optimum dose of zopiclone. In the main study zopiclone 7.5 mg was comparable to diazepam 10 mg at 20, 40, and 60 min after administration and more efficacious at 90 min.", 
    "64": "Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone derivative which exerts, in animal and man, an hypnotic activity comparable to that of flurazepam. In healthy adult insomniacs it was well tolerated upon repeated administration for 28 days. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, three dose levels of zopiclone (5, 7.5, and 10 mg) were compared to 15 mg of flurazepam in 30 geriatric insomniacs. The 7.5- and 10-mg doses demonstrated hypnotic potency comparable to that of flurazepam, and the active treatments were superior to placebo. For most sleep indices, 7.5 mg was the optimal therapeutic dose. Few side effects were reported. These were not clinically significant. Zopiclone is efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of geriatric patients suffering from insomnia. A dosage range of 7.5-10 mg is recommended.", 
    "65": "Zopiclone is a new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, the recommended dose of which is 7.5 mg. It was compared to flurazepam 30 mg in a sleep laboratory study. 12 women aged 40-60 years, with subjective sleep disorders for at least 2 months, were treated for 13 nights with each drug in a crossover double-blind design. Each active drug period was preceded by 5 days of placebo washout and followed by 35 days of withdrawal (no treatment). A baseline period of 4 nights (without treatment) was obtained before the study itself. The subjects slept in the sleep laboratory during the baseline period, during the last 3 nights on placebo, during the last 3 nights on active drug, and from the 11th to the 13th night after active drug discontinuation. Polygraphic recordings were obtained during each of these nights. The criteria of Kales and Rechtschaffen were used to score the tracings. Both drugs were shown to be effective when compared to placebo. Comparisons between the two periods with active treatment did not show significant differences for sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency index, stage 0, percent REM, number of REM periods, and REM latency. There was a trend towards an increase with zopiclone of the number of awakenings, percent of stage 3, percent of deep sleep, and an increase with flurazepam of the percent of light sleep. A significant difference was only found for percent of stage 2 (increased with flurazepam).", 
    "66": "Zopiclone, a new hypnotic with an original chemical structure, was compared in a sleep laboratory study with nitrazepam according to a double-blind, parallel group randomized design. Zopiclone (7.5 mg) and nitrazepam (5 mg) were each given for 14 nights to 5 insomniacs; a placebo washout period of 4 nights and a placebo withdrawal period of 10 nights were included in the design. Both drugs were found to be immediately and lastingly effective. Some slight insomnia rebound was found with nitrazepam, but not with zopiclone. Stage 2 was decreased, slow wave sleep (SWS) increased, and rapid eye movement unchanged by both drugs: however, only nitrazepam increased rapid eye movement latency. The differences between the effects of the drugs were quite limited. However, 3 out of 50 comparisons favoured zopiclone and none nitrazepam."
