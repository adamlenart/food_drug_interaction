    "0": "Benzodiazepines are relatively safe compounds. They do, however, have an adverse effect on psychomotor and cognitive functions. A variety of behavioural and mood disturbances have been reported, including increased hostility, depression, antisocial behaviour, paranoid ideation, and suicidal tendencies. Benzodiazepines may produce pharmacological dependence in therapeutic dosage. The typical pattern of a drug dependence syndrome is rare. Dependence is primarily manifested by an abstinence syndrome occurring after the dose of the drug is reduced or treatment is stopped. The problems of distinguishing between the abstinence syndrome and anxiety are highlighted. Withdrawing a patient from benzodiazepines is discussed, as well as the management of the withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "1": "The benzodiazepines are among the most widely prescribed of all drugs and are generally thought to be safe. A review of the pertinent research done in North America, the UK and Europe on their clinical use is presented. Major indications for the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders are discussed, as well as some differential indications for various benzodiazepines including their use in neurological disorders. Finally the question of whether benzodiazepines are overused is addressed and some principles regarding a sound basis for their administration are put forward.", 
    "2": "Twenty benzodiazepines (BDZs) are at present registered in the RSA. They are anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant and possibly muscle relaxant. Structure-activity relationships are important in modelling BDZ molecules for optimum binding to receptors. Electrophysiological, behavioural and neurochemical effects of BDZs are good indicators of therapeutic potential, and help to elucidate mechanism(s) of action. Specific BDZ receptors on neurons (gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor-associated) and on astrocytes (not associated with GABA receptors) exist in the mammalian central nervous system. BDZs enhance GABA neurotransmission. Selective BDZ antagonists (e.g. Ro 15-1788) are important as research tools, and potentially as diagnostic aids and therapeutic agents. Other possible mechanisms for BDZ action include the roles of adenosine and serotonin. Endogenous BDZ-receptor ligands (e.g. inosine, hypoxanthine, nicotinamide) may be important, but the physiological role of BDZ receptors remains speculative.", 
    "3": "At present several benzodiazepines are available for clinical use. Pharmacological and clinical studies have failed to show qualitative differences between them. The main variations among individual benzodiazepines are in their pharmacokinetics and metabolism. The differences in the rates of absorption, volumes of distribution, distribution half-lives, compartmental kinetics, metabolism and elimination half-lives between individual benzodiazepines are reviewed. These influence the selection of a particular benzodiazepine for a specific patient or condition. Guidelines for particular clinical situations are provided.", 
    "4": "The purified gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex from bovine cerebral cortex has been reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles by a cholate dialysis procedure. The reconstituted receptor bound [3H]flunitrazepam at a single class of sites with dissociation constant Kd = 2.9 +/- 0.3 nM, an increase in affinity to the membrane level from the 4-fold weakening found in detergent solution. It also bound [3H]muscimol with a Kd for the high-affinity sites of approximately 50 nM. [35S]tert.-Butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate, for which there is evidence in membranes for binding to a channel gating site on this receptor, showed similar binding to the reconstituted receptor.", 
    "5": "The ability of the triazolobenzodiazepines to antagonize the anxiogenic effects of three different compounds in the social interaction test was investigated. The compounds were selected for their different sites of action in the central nervous system: FG 7142, acting at the beta-carboline site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex; pentylenetetrazole, acting at the picrotoxin site on this complex, and yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Adinazolam (5 mg/kg) and U-43,465 (32 mg/kg) were able to antagonize the anxiogenic effects of all three compounds, unlike classical 1,4-benzodiazepines, that are not able to antagonize the effects of yohimbine. The results are discussed in terms of the anti-panic activity of the triazolobenzodiazepines.", 
    "6": "Stress-induced renin and prolactin secretion was investigated using a conditioned emotional response paradigm. Three minutes after placement in a chamber the rats received an electric shock to their feet via the grid floor, then were immediately returned to their home cage. This procedure was repeated for 3 consecutive days. On the fourth day, instead of receiving an electric shock, they were removed after 3 min and sacrificed by decapitation. Control rats were treated identically with the exception that shock was not administered at any time. There was a significant increase in plasma renin activity and prolactin level in the stressed rats. The administration of the antianxiety drugs chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.) or midazolam (0.125-2 mg/kg i.p.) blocked the stress-induced increase in prolactin levels but not the stress-induced rise in plasma renin activity. Administration of the beta-blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited, but did not completely block, stress-induced rise in plasma-renin activity and had no effect on stress-induced prolactin secretion. The opiate antagonist naloxone (0.1-10 mg/kg i.p.) and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) did not block stress-induced renin or prolactin secretion. It is concluded that stress-induced prolactin secretion is regulated by a benzodiazepine-mediated mechanism and that stress-induced renin but not prolactin secretion is mediated in part via beta-receptors.", 
    "7": "[35S]t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), a bicyclic cage convulsant, binds to the anion gating mechanism of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex. Using a carefully calibrated radiation inactivation technique, the molecular weight of [35S]TBPS binding complexes from frozen rat cerebral cortex was estimated to be 137,000 daltons. The GABA agonist muscimol reduced [35S]TBPS binding to 0-10% of the control value, in a way which is independent of the radiation dose. This shows that the GABA receptor (Mw = 55,000 daltons) is included in the 137,000-dalton [35S]-TBPS binding complex; the [35S]TBPS binding protein alone accounts for 137,000-55,000 = 82,000 daltons. The pyrazolopyridazine etazolate (SQ 20.009) and etomidate in appropriate concentrations both reduced specific binding of [35S]TBPS. The ability of SQ 20.009 and etomidate to reduce [35S]TBPS binding was greatly reduced by exposure to low radiation doses, suggesting that SQ 20.009 and etomidate reduce [35S]TBPS binding by an allosteric mechanism requiring a molecular structure of 450,000-500,000 daltons. Benzodiazepine agonists (ethyl 4-methoxymethyl-6-benzyloxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, ZK 93423) and inverse agonists (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, DMCM) enhance and reduce [35S]TBPS binding, respectively, in repeatedly frozen and washed membrane preparations. The effects of ZK 93423 and DMCM on [35S]TBPS binding disappeared upon exposure of membranes to low radiation doses. This suggests that the benzodiazepine receptor site interacts allosterically with the [35S]TBPS binding site, requiring a molecular complex of at least c. 400,000 daltons. The [35S]TBPS site alone in these latter conditions of membrane preparation (repeatedly frozen/washed) revealed a molecular weight of 221,000 daltons (TBPS-site + GABA receptor + unknown structures). The number of binding sites for [35S]TBPS (145 pmol/g tissue) was only slightly higher than for [3H]flunitrazepam (130 pmol/g tissue) in cerebral cortex. These results are all consonant with the conclusion that the GABA/BZ receptor chloride channel complex is composed of highly integrated multimeric subunits, tentatively accounted for by a tetramic complex of molecular weight 548,000 daltons.", 
    "8": "The localization of muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes was studied in the human spinal cord using in vitro labelling of cryostat sections with [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB) and [3H]pirenzepine (PZ) followed by autoradiography. The highest densities of [3H]QNB binding were localized in laminae II (substantia gelatinosa) and IX (motor neurons); in contrast, the highest density of [3H]PZ binding was localized to lamina II where the binding density was 22-32% higher than in lamina IX. These results suggest that the M1 and M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes may be differentially localized in sensory and motor regions of the human spinal cord.", 
    "9": "Owing to the pharmacological and clinical importance of the determination of plasma and urine levels of the hydroxy metabolites of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam in healthy volunteers and in epileptic patients, a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed that permits the determination of all these compounds in the same plasma or urine sample. The method involved ether extraction at pH 13 with diazepam as internal standard for the measurement of clobazam and N-desmethylcobazam, followed by ether extraction at pH 9 with nitrazepam as internal standard for the measurement of the hydroxy derivatives. The limit of detection was about 10-20 ng/ml for each of these compounds. Applications to patients were limited by chromatographic interferences between the hydroxy metabolites and some medications currently associated with clobazam in the treatment of epilepsy. The only interference in clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam analysis was from N-desmethyldiazepam. Despite these inconveniences, this HPLC procedure appears to be the only available method for the simultaneous quantification of clobazam and its three main metabolites.", 
    "10": "A new, competitive, nonpeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, asperlicin, was isolated from the fungus Aspergillus alliaceus. The compound has 300 to 400 times the affinity for pancreatic, ileal, and gallbladder CCK receptors than proglumide, a standard agent of this class. Moreover, asperlicin is highly selective for peripheral CCK receptors relative to brain CCK and gastrin receptors. Since asperlicin also exhibits long-lasting CCK antagonist activity in vivo, it should provide a valuable tool for investigating the physiological and pharmacological actions of CCK.", 
    "11": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of atenolol as compared with placebo in the treatment of patients hospitalized with the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In addition to receiving customary therapy, 61 patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol, and 59 to receive placebo. Outcome was assessed daily by the measurement of nine features in three categories: vital signs, clinical signs (e.g., tremor), and behavioral signs (e.g., agitation and anxiety). Compared with placebo patients, atenolol patients had a significant reduction in the mean length of hospital stay (four as compared with five days, P less than 0.02). On each treatment day, significantly fewer patients receiving atenolol required concomitant benzodiazepines, and patients receiving placebo required a significantly higher mean daily dose of benzodiazepines. Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at base line, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol, and their abnormal behavior and clinical characteristics also resolved more rapidly. We conclude that atenolol is helpful in the treatment of patients with the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "12": "The effect of several mu and kappa opioid receptor agonists on rat plasma corticosterone levels, measured using radioimmunoassay, was investigated. The mu agonists, morphine and fentanyl, and the kappa agonists, U-50,488, tifluadom and bremazocine, all produced dose-related increases in rat plasma corticosterone levels. The effects of both fentanyl and U-50,488 were reversed by naloxone, indicating an action at opioid receptors. Pretreatment of the rats with the irreversible, mu-selective antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine, reduced the effect of fentanyl, but not that of U-50,488, indicating that both mu and kappa opioid receptors are involved in mediating this effect.", 
    "13": "Valproate-Diazepam association is not unusual in the treatment of epilepsies. The present paper investigates in an experimental study the effect of sodium valproate (VPA) on the regional cerebral level of diazepam (DZP), and the relationship with plasma or erythrocytes amounts after subchronic administration. The VPA addition increases the DZP levels in peripheral and central compartments. The results shows a linear correlation between the drug concentration in all areas studied and the plasmatic or erythrocytic amounts during the CNS - impregnation phase. The VPA influence is greater in the CNS where the DZP impregnation is selectively increased, specially in cortex and cerebellum.", 
    "14": "Carbamazepine (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p., P less than 0.01; 40 mg/kg p.o., P less than 0.01), Li2CO3 (200 mg/kg, i.p., P less than 0.01; 200 mg/kg, p.o., P less than 0.05), diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., P less than 0.01) and haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., P less than 0.01) significantly decreased the number of fighting episodes induced by footshock in mice. Picrotoxin (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) and bicuculline (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) antagonized the effect of carbamazepine or diazepam completely. Our present results suggest that the taming property of carbamazepine in the footshock model have some relation with the GABAergic mechanism.", 
    "15": "A forty-two year old female with known alcoholic liver disease was given intravenous lorazepam and diazepam for delirium tremens. This resulted in a comatose state with depression of some brainstem reflexes. Her initial EEG showed a pattern of spindle coma with some responsivity of the background. Clinical improvement occurred with cessation of the benzodiazepines and the EEG showed a return to normal patterns. A review of the literature showed no previous description of this pattern in benzodiazepine coma. Two reports of spindle coma are noted with alcohol and imipramine. The prognostic significance of this pattern in drug overdose is therefore not definitive by itself. Outcome is probably more dependent on the clinical condition of the patient and the reversibility of the drug toxicity.", 
    "16": "The anxiety and pain-relieving effect of paracetamol 10 mg/kg or a combination of aminophenazone 4 mg/kg and diazepam 0.2 mg/kg suppositories was studied in 82 children after tonsillectomy in a double-blind study. Both suppositories were studied after halothane or enflurane anaesthesia. At 30 min after administration of coded suppositories, 88-90% of the children in various groups needed extra analgesics, and received pethidine 0.5 mg/kg i.v. Thereafter, the anxiety and pain relief was satisfactory in all groups. There was no significant difference between the effects caused by the drugs. No bleeding occurred from the operation site in any of the study groups. The results suggest that both paracetamol and a combination of aminophenazone and diazepam in the doses used here were weak analgesics for throat pain after tonsillectomy in children during the early postoperative period.", 
    "17": "In a randomized cross-over study on sedation in outpatient oral surgery, subcutaneous administration of morphine-scopolamine was compared with rectal administration of diazepam. The mean dose of morphine was 0.13 mg kg-1 (range 0.13-0.24) and of diazepam 0.57 mg kg-1 (range 0.50-0.71). Apprehension, the determining factor for patients' preference for sedation method, the recovery from sedation and the postoperative course were studied. Both methods produced the desired effects. For diazepam, the effect was scored higher by the patient than the nurse observer and for morphine-scopolamine the opposite was found. Postoperative pain and patients' preference for sedation did not differ between the methods and the determining factor for the patients' preference for sedation method was the experience of stronger tranquilization. Side-effects such as prolonged recovery, nausea, dizziness, and dysphoria were frequent during the postoperative course after the morphine-scopolamine sedation but were not seen during diazepam sedation. Thus, rectal administration of diazepam should be preferred to morphine and scopolamine for sedation in minor oral surgery performed under local anesthesia.", 
    "18": "Seventeen healthy children undergoing eye surgery in general anaesthesia were given morphine rectally for premedication. Six patients (Group I) were given morphine 0.15 mg X kg-1 in a propylene glycol solution also containing diazepam and hyoscine. Eleven patients (Group II) were given morphine 0.5 mg X kg-1 in a starch hydrogel preparation. The plasma concentrations of morphine (Groups I and II) and diazepam (Group I) were studied. After the lower dosage of morphine the plasma concentrations never exceeded 10 ng X ml-1, whereas the mean peak plasma concentration was 25.3 +/- 5.5 ng X ml-1 after the higher dosage. One child in each of Groups I and II needed postoperative analgesics. The simultaneous plasma concentration of morphine was then lower than 5 ng X ml-1. Postoperative nausea occurred to about the same extent in both groups. It is suggested that morphine given rectally in a starch hydrogel may be an alternative to oral and parenteral routes of administration.", 
    "19": "When either diazepam or imipramine hydrochloride was administered orally to rats with thioacetamide-induced hepatic cirrhosis, the biliary and faecal elimination of metabolites was significantly decreased compared with that in normal animals. However, renal excretion of metabolites of diazepam or imipramine was increased in the liver-damaged rats. Experiments in vitro showed that liver homogenates from cirrhotic rats metabolized diazepam or imipramine hydrochloride in qualitatively and quantitatively similar ways to those from normal rats. Clearance of radioactivity from the blood following i.v. administration of either diazepam or imipramine hydrochloride was prolonged in animals with experimental cirrhosis.", 
    "20": "In decerebrate, paralyzed and vagotomized cats, we recorded activities of hypoglossal and phrenic nerves and of the mylohyoid branch of the trigeminal nerve. At normocapnia, a respiratory-modulated trigeminal discharge could be discerned in most cats. This discharge was characterized by a diminution of activity during neural inspiration and a peak in expiration. In hypercapnia or hypoxia, peak activity increased and its time of occurrence moved to late inspiration. Augmentations of peak trigeminal, hypoglossal and phrenic activities were proportional. Peak trigeminal and hypoglossal activities increased more than phrenic following administrations of protriptyline, strychnine and, in some cats, cyanide or doxapram. Peak trigeminal activity fell more than phrenic after diazepam. Pentobarbital or halothane reduced peak hypoglossal, but not trigeminal, activity more than phrenic. However, after these anesthetics, trigeminal activity became restricted to the inspiratory-expiratory junction. We conclude that trigeminal and hypoglossal activities are more dependent upon processes within the reticular formation than is the bulbospinal-phrenic system. Central and peripheral chemoreceptor influences are distributed equivalently upon trigeminal, hypoglossal and phrenic motoneurons.", 
    "21": "Acute administration of phenytoin (40 and 75 mg/kg) was unable to counteract seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole and even prolonged them in some cases. These prolonged seizures remained with chronic (10 days) treatment but an anticonvulsant effect of phenytoin (40 and 75 mg/kg) also emerged, shown by a decrease in the incidence of seizures. This latter effect could be detected even 24 hr after the last dose. Both acute and chronic treatment with phenytoin (40 or 75 mg/kg) were able to enhance anticonvulsant efficacy of diazepam against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. The mechanisms underlying these three independent effects of phenytoin and their clinical relevance are discussed.", 
    "22": "From 1976 to 1980, there were 3,193 admissions due to acute drug overdosage at the Resuscitation Center of the Klinikum Charlottenburg of Berlin, Free University. We determined the frequency and characteristics of self-poisoning with antidepressants and some low potency neuroleptic drugs (perazine and thioridazine). These drugs were involved in 92 cases (i.e., 3%) during a 5-year period. Amitriptyline - in combination with a benzodiazepine - was the most common antidepressant taken by the patients. 10 of the patients required assisted ventilation. Complete ECG recordings were carried out in 24 patients; 21 of them had abnormalities comprising prolonged QTC and PR intervals (19, 15 and 8 patients, respectively). Sinus tachycardia was present in half of those patients. In no cases were convulsions or cardiac arrhythmias requiring special treatment described in the medical records. The percentage of patients showing ECG changes and respiratory depression was higher when other drugs such as ethanol were ingested along with antidepressants than when only antidepressants were taken. The incidence of antidepressant self-poisoning in this area was relatively low compared to the results of other studies. Possible explanations for its low frequency could be a low rate of prescription of antidepressants, a low dosage prescribed or the success of antidepressants in the treatment of depression and thereby in the prevention of attempted suicide.", 
    "23": "Survivors of car crashes often suffer from a post-traumatic fear of driving, generalized anxiety and depression. Unremitting pains are also common. As part of a pilot study 30 referred subjects were exposed to imagery of driving and accidents. Seventy-seven percent were phobic of driving. Fifty-three percent responded with increased anxiety to the imagery. Twelve treatment referrals received exposure therapy and six improved markedly. An additional four improved when a Benzodiazepine was added temporarily. Four out of eight subjects lost their unremitting pains along with their fears. When guided imagery evoked intense anxiety this seemed to predict a favourable outcome. A resumption of pleasure trips was a reliable criterion of recovery. The frequency of phobic symptomatology and it's importance to the understanding and management of post-traumatic anxiety states is discussed.", 
    "24": "Two hundred and eight healthy children who were to undergo minor elective surgery during halothane, nitrous oxide, oxygen anaesthesia were studied in a double blind investigation to evaluate the sedative and anticholinergic effects of two rectal premedications. Group I received diazepam 0.75 mg/kg rectally; Group II received a mixture of diazepam 0.5 mg/kg, morphine 0.15 mg/kg and hyoscine 0.01 mg/kg rectally. No significant difference was found between the two groups in sedative or anticholinergic effects during induction of anaesthesia or in the postoperative period. No adverse effects were seen.", 
    "25": "This paper reviews 146 cases of acute poisoning seen and treated by us at the adult accident and emergency centre of Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, between 1979 and 1982. Barbiturates (19%) and benzodiazepines (17%) were the commonest drugs used in acute poisoning. The highest incidence (41%) was found among persons aged 18-25 years. There were 67 males and 79 females (1:1.2). About 14% took a \"cocktail\" of more than one drug. Self-poisoning occurred in 74%; 8.6% were apparently suicidal; 15.8% were accidental; and 1.4% were homicidal. Fifty of the patients (33%) were unconscious on admission. The centre's management technique is briefly discussed and the need for a poisons information centre in the country is highlighted.", 
    "26": "All human beings are biologic, psychological, and sociologic creatures. The treatment program for agoraphobia at the University of Kansas Medical Center School of Medicine, Kansas City, is designed to deal effectively with problems in these three areas. The biologic area is dealt with by medication; tricyclic antidepressants are used to block panic attacks, and benzodiazepines are given, as needed, for anticipatory anxiety. Group therapy is particularly effective in the areas of individual psychopathology and social anxiety. We have not found agoraphobia difficult to treat and have demonstrated that it can be cured. The track record of primary care physicians and specialists in diagnosing and managing agoraphobia so far leaves much to be desired. If physicians obtain the appropriate history at initial contact with a patient and administer appropriate treatment, it may be possible to prevent full-blown agoraphobia from developing.", 
    "27": "Functional versus organic vocal cord paralysis can be difficult to differentiate at times. If a tracheostomy has already been performed, the distinction can be made by the use of intratracheal pressure monitoring while the patient is being sedated. If the problem is functional then rapid decannulation can be accomplished as described in this report.", 
    "28": "Choroid plexus contains an active transport (influx) and a facilitated diffusion (efflux) system for nucleosides. The ability of diazepam and thiopental to inhibit active transport or facilitated diffusion of thymidine in choroid plexus was measured in vitro under various conditions. When isolated rabbit choroid plexuses were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 1 microM [3H] thymidine for 10 min at 37 degrees C under 95% O2-5% CO2, diazepam (10 microM) and thiopental (500 microM) doubled the tissue-to-medium ratios of [3H] thymidine from 8 to 15 to 16. These results were not due to metabolism or intracellular binding but rather to inhibition of [3H] thymidine efflux from choroid plexus. Diazepam, unlike thiopental, inhibited [3H] thymidine efflux in a concentration-dependent manner. When isolated choroid plexuses were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing low concentrations of [3H] thymidine (6 nM) to allow intracellular conversion of [3H] thymidine into [3H] thymidine phosphates and [3H] DNA, both diazepam (10 microM) and thiopental (500 microM) altered [3H] thymidine accumulation and metabolism consistent with inhibition of facilitated diffusion but not active transport of thymidine. These studies provide evidence that, at toxic but not therapeutic concentrations, diazepam and thiopental alter facilitated nucleoside transport in the choroid plexus.", 
    "29": "Eighty-two patients suffering from panic attacks with or without phobias were examined for evidence of thyroid disease. None of the patients had abnormal total T4 or T3 resin uptake measurements, regardless of whether they were nonmedicated or treated with one of three antipanic drugs: alprazolam, phenelzine, or imipramine. A higher than expected incidence of undetectable TSH levels (22% overall) appeared in all groups. The clinical relevance of this finding is currently uncertain.", 
    "30": "Drugs like diazepam induce tranquilization in small doses and sedation in larger quantities. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured before and 5 min after the intravenous administration of nonsedating doses of diazepam or placebo (given on a double-blind basis) to 20 right-handed volunteers. Subjects who received diazepam showed marked right hemispheric rCBF decreases, especially in the frontal lobe, whereas controls did not show significant differences between the two sets of values. None of the subjects became sleepy during the experiment.", 
    "31": "Various pharmacokinetic parameters--disposition half-life, t1/2,z, metabolic clearance CLm, volume of distribution V, intrinsic clearance of unbound drug CLuint, and unbound volume of distribution of tissues (distributive tissue volume/fraction of drug in tissue unbound, VT/fuT--are compared in rat and human for nine weakly acidic drugs, phenytoin, hexobarbital, pentobarbital, phenylbutazone, warfarin, tolbutamide, valproate, phenobarbital, and amobarbital, and six weakly basic drugs, quinidine, chlorpromazine, propranolol, pentazocin, antipyrine, and diazepam. With regard to all parameters, statistically significant correlations are obtained when parameters are plotted on a log-log plot. Correlation coefficients between the intrinsic parameters (CLuint or VT/fuT) were higher than those between the hybrid parameters (t1/2,z, CLm or V). In general, these drugs were metabolized ten times more rapidly in rat than in human. With regard to the tissue distribution of these drugs, there was little difference between rat and human. Predictions of CLm, V, and t1/2, in humans using rat data were successful for most drugs, with a few marked exceptions.", 
    "32": "Pyknoleptic petit mal is a childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by frequent absence seizures and a specific EEG pattern. The EEG trait is dominantly inherited. It represents the paradigm of primary generalized epilepsy with cortico-reticular participation. The clinical features include disturbances of awareness and/or responsiveness and frequently associated events such as mild clonic components, postural changes and automatisms. Treatment is usually successful in eliminating seizures and the prognosis is favorable for terminal remission though generalized tonic-clonic seizures may ensue.", 
    "33": "Effects of four pesticides (carbaryl, propoxur, chlordimeform, and deltamethrin) and two reference drugs, physostigmine and chlordiazepoxide, were measured on the performance of rats trained on a continuous non-match (CNM) delayed comparison, working memory procedure. These same compounds were also tested in analogous, large and small stimulus difference discrimination (i.e., non working-memory) procedures. The effects of the pesticides and physostigmine on CNM performance were qualitatively similar, and also similar to their effects on discrimination performance. As dosage of these compounds increased, only small effects on accuracy were observed, followed at still larger doses by an abrupt and non-selective decrease in all responding. The pesticides and physostigmine did not selectively affect working memory: the magnitude of their effects did not increase with intertrial interval, and the compounds were equally effective in disrupting discrimination and CNM performance. Effects of chlordiazepoxide on performance in the CNM and discrimination control procedures differed qualitatively from those of the pesticides and physostigmine.", 
    "34": "Effects of four pesticides (carbaryl, propoxur, chlordimeform, and deltamethrin) and four reference drugs (physostigmine, scopolamine, methscopolamine, and chlordiazepoxide) were measured in two delayed response, working memory procedures: go-no go alternation in which rats initiated their own trials, and spatial reversals. Four of these compounds (carbaryl, propoxur, physostigmine, and scopolamine) were also tested in a go-no go alternation procedure in which animals did not initiate their trials. The pesticides and physostigmine did not selectively affect working memory in any of the procedures: low doses only moderately decreased response accuracy, whereas higher doses suppressed responding indiscriminately. The pesticides and physostigmine had similar effects on go-no go alternation (i.e., working memory) and analogous go-no go discrimination performance. Effects on go-no go alternation performance did not depend on whether the animals initiated their own trials. Scopolamine, in contrast, appeared to disrupt working memory. It profoundly disrupted accuracy at doses that only moderately decreased over-all responding and impaired go-no go alternation accuracy much more than discrimination accuracy.", 
    "35": "Plasma binding of imipramine and lidocaine, two drugs that bind predominantly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG), and of diazepam and phenytoin, albumin-bound drugs, were studied in fresh human plasma. Binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis with 0.1 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer at 37 degrees C. AAG was determined by immunodiffusion. Lidocaine free fraction (FF) (30-35%) was time-dependent, reaching equilibrium by five hours. However, dialysis time exceeding 8 hours greatly increased lidocaine FF (60%) accompanied by a decrease in AAG concentration. Lidocaine binding and AAG-concentration were not affected by plasma freezing, and were independent of lidocaine concentrations from 0.5-10 micrograms/ml. Imipramine behaved comparably, with FF increasing from 15% at 5 hours of dialysis to 30% at 24 h, concurrent with a drop in AAG concentration. Imipramine binding and AAG concentration were also independent of plasma freezing and drug concentration from 0.25 to 10.0 micrograms/ml. Binding of diazepam (FF = 1.2%) and phenytoin (FF = 17%) were stable at 24 hours, not affected by sample freezing or drug concentration, and were independent of AAG concentration. Therefore, changes in AAG concentration alter plasma protein binding of AAG-bound drugs lidocaine and imipramine. Extended dialysis results in decreased concentrations of immunoreactive AAG and increased FF. In contrast, the binding of albumin-bound drugs diazepam and phenytoin are not affected by these variables.", 
    "36": "LHRH (100 micrograms i.v. bolus) was given to six young healthy men under basal conditions and after the administration of pirenzepine (10, 20, 30 or 40 mg i.v. 10 min before LHRH), which is a selective blocker of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Pretreatment with 10 mg of pirenzepine did not modify LH and FSH responses to LHRH, whereas larger amounts of the drug significantly reduced gonadotrophin responses to LHRH. A dose-related effect of the drug was not observed, since a maximal reduction of LHRH-induced gonadotrophin secretion was already present when 20 mg of pirenzepine were used. When the effect of pirenzepine (20 mg) on the basal concentrations of FSH and LH was studied in four additional sex and age matched subjects, no significant changes were observed for at least 120 min after the injection. These results demonstrate that LHRH-induced LH and FSH secretion involves a muscarinic cholinergic mechanism.", 
    "37": "A severe withdrawal syndrome occurred in a patient after oxazepam 10 mg bid was substituted for diazepam 5 mg bid. The onset of symptoms was consistent with the rate of decline of diazepam and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam. Reintroduction of diazepam produced prompt symptom remission. This report and others suggest the need for caution when substituting a short-acting drug for a long-acting one, even when usual doses of each are used. The chronic use of benzodiazepines for eight months or longer prior to substitution or withdrawal appears to place the patient at a higher risk of incurring withdrawal phenomena. Slow and careful tapering of drug is required in such patients to reduce the risk of withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "38": "The muscle relaxant action of ZK 93423 (6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester), a novel beta-carboline with agonistic properties at the benzodiazepine receptor, was examined by assessing its effect on the tonic electromyogram (EMG) activity of the gastrocnemiussoleus (GS) muscle of genetically spastic rats and on ventral root reflexes, presynaptic inhibition and fusimotor activity in the spinal cord of decerebrate cats. ZK 93423 (0.1-10.0 mg kg-1) depressed the tonic EMG activity in mutant rats in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5.0 mg kg-1). Both ZK 93423 (0.5 mg kg-1) and diazepam (0.3 mg kg-1) enhanced the presynaptic inhibition of the GS muscle and associated dorsal root potentials in decerebrate cats in an almost identical manner. The actions of both drugs were reversed by Ro 15-1788 (5.0 mg kg-1). ZK 93423 (0.5 mg kg-1) and diazepam (0.3 mg kg-1) depressed the activity of both static and dynamic fusimotor neurones, as deduced from changes in the afferent responses of muscle spindle primary endings to low frequency (1 s-1) sinusoidal stretching. The depressant action of diazepam (0.3 mg kg-1) was weaker than that of ZK 93423 (0.5 mg kg-1). The actions of both drugs were reversed by Ro 15-1788 (5.0 mg kg-1). ZK 93423 (0.5 mg kg-1) failed to alter the magnitude of monosynaptic ventral root reflexes evoked by electrical stimulation of a flexor and an extensor nerve, whereas diazepam (0.3 mg kg-1) had a depressant effect on both types of monosynaptic reflexes, which was antagonized by Ro 15-1788 (5.0 mg kg-1). Neither ZK 93423 (0.5 mg kg-1) nor diazepam (0.3 mg kg-1) depressed polysynaptic ventral root reflexes evoked by electrical stimulation of a flexor and a cutaneous nerve. The present results demonstrate that ZK 93423 exerts a potent muscle relaxant action due to a specific interaction with benzodiazepine receptors. However, its profile of actions on spinal motor mechanisms is not identical to that of diazepam.", 
    "39": "Behavioral disturbances associated with the use of anticonvulsant therapy may be readily apparent and easily diagnosed. They are most commonly reported with the use of barbiturates and usually include hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, irritability, and emotional lability. But, subtle behavioral disturbances may also adversely affect performance and learning. Behavioral changes resulting from therapy with barbiturates and benzodiazepines tend to be idiosyncratic as opposed to the dose-related affects seen with phenytoin and valproate therapy. Carbamazepine and valproate can affect mood and behavior negatively, but, generally, this occurs less frequently than when several other anticonvulsants are used; this is especially true in patients without CNS damage. The suspicion that there may be a causal relationship between anticonvulsant therapy and impairment of cognitive skills in nonintoxicated patients is gaining increasing support. Neuropsychologic studies in acutely exposed normal volunteers, studies in epileptic patients receiving monotherapy, and crossover studies between drugs have incriminated barbiturates and hydantoin drugs. Memory/cognitive dysfunction, although affected to a greater extent with higher drug dosages, has been reported with levels within the therapeutic range. Thus, serum drug levels cannot be considered good predictors of which patients will have subtle side effects. Carbamazepine and valproate seem to be relatively free of many adverse neuropsychologic effects, although additional studies need to be performed. The complete separation of seizure effects from drug effects remains on ongoing goal. Similarly, in comparative studies to date, the issues of whether the differences between the drugs are due to negative effects of one or positive psychotropic effects of the other, or both, are not adequately addressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Many patients referred to specialized affective disorder units in the 1970s because of chronicity, treatment resistance, or treatment failure were found to have been inadequately treated--most typically with suboptimal trials of one to two tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). In the 1980s, patients are being declared \"treatment failures\" following a more sophisticated range of treatment efforts. In part, the change can be attributed to systematic feedback provided by mood clinics to referring clinicians and to nationwide educational efforts. Terminologic and conceptual issues are reviewed, and chronicity and treatment failure in patients with affective disorders are examined from a multifactorial perspective involving pharmacokinetic factors, patient compliance, adequacy of somatic treatments, physician countertransference, social and interpersonal aspects, nosologic considerations, and medical-neurologic contributions. A systematic approach for evaluating and treating such patients is outlined.", 
    "41": "In this rapid, sensitive method for simultaneously determining diazepam and its biologically active metabolites--nordiazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam--in serum, 250 to 1000 microL of serum is extracted with ether and the extracted compounds are quantified by \"high-performance\" liquid chromatography on a Shimpack FLC-C8 microparticulate column. Absorbance of the effluent is monitored at 254 nm. The limit of detection in serum is about 10 micrograms/L for each drug. Analytical recovery of each drug added to the serum varied from 91 to 102% for oxazepam and temazepam, from 82 to 99% for nordiazepam and diazepam. Within-day and between-day CVs ranged from 2 to 5% for oxazepam and temazepam, and from 2 to 7% for nordiazepam and diazepam. We also report results on using this assay in a pharmacokinetic study of high doses of diazepam used to treat chronic schizophrenic patients.", 
    "42": "Sixty-three out-patients suffering from primary non-agitated depression were included in a double-blind, between-patient randomized study. All patients were treated with imipramine (100-200 mg-day) combined with either placebo, diazepam (10 mg/day) or dixyrazine (50 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The clinical efficacy assessed with a subscale of CPRS was significantly (p1 less than or equal to 0.05) better for the imipramine-dixyrazine combination than for the imipramine-diazepam or imipramine-placebo combination. Serum concentration of imipramine was significantly higher (p1 less than or equal to 0.05) in the group treated with dixyrazine than in the other two groups. Further, serum concentration of imipramine in the diazepam group was significantly lower (p1 less than or equal to 0.05) than in the placebo group. At the end of the study, 67% in both the placebo and the diazepam group and 86% in the dixyrazine group were practically symptom-free.", 
    "43": "This paper reports the results of a single blind clinical study of drug treatment response of 20 patients with Tourette's syndrome to haloperidol and clonazepam. Because patients with Tourette's syndrome have been reported to have increased red blood cell choline levels, choline levels were examined in relation to treatment response. Differential drug treatment response was found among patients with high versus low red blood cell-to-plasma choline ratios. Patients with high red blood cell-to-plasma choline ratios responded better to clonazepam than to haloperidol. This suggests that there may be two distinct subtypes of patients with Tourette's syndrome.", 
    "44": "3H-Imipramine binding in platelets was measured in 63 severely depressed hospitalized patients, who had been drug free (with the exception of moderate doses of benzodiazepines) for at least 1 month, and in 53 healthy control subjects of comparable age and sex distribution. Bmax of 3H-imipramine binding was significantly lower in the depressed subjects (1012 +/- SD 295 vs. 1123 +/- SD 178 fmole/mg protein). Depressed patients who had attempted suicide by violent means tended to have higher Bmax than nonviolent attempters.", 
    "45": "The action of a new muscarinic antagonist drug on the pancreatic secretion has been studied in 12 healthy subjects. A stable pancreatic secretory plateau was obtained with submaximal hormonal stimulation (0.125 CU/kg/h secretin: 30 ng/kg/h caerulein). The highest dose of pirenzepine (40 mg) inhibited both volume and enzymatic concentration and output (-72.2% and -77.9% of plateau value for chymotrypsin and lipase output, respectively, 30 min after pirenzepine injection). The inhibition appeared immediately, lasted for more than 60 min, and was dose-related. The calcium dose-response curve paralleled those of lipase and chymotrypsin outputs. These results were comparable to those obtained with other anti-acetylcholine drugs and may be associated with the action of certain doses of ethanol on pancreatic secretion. In contrast, the lowest pirenzepine dose used (10 mg) induced a delayed stimulation of bicarbonate output, and bicarbonate concentration was not altered.", 
    "46": "In a group of 94 duodenal ulcer patients consecutively studied and followed-up for 1 year, subjects with maximal acid output (M.A.O.) above 60 mmol/hour (mostly heavy-smoking men), were found to relapse more frequently than those with lower M.A.O. values (72.2% versus 27.6%; p less than 0.0005). A significantly higher relapse rate was also detected in patients treated with maintenance dosages of effective antisecretory drugs (cimetidine, ranitidine, pirenzepine) and presenting M.A.O. over 60 mmol/hour. It is yet to be established whether an alternative therapeutic regime may prove effective in preventing ulcer recurrence in patients with gastric hypersecretion.", 
    "47": "The existence in rat frontal cerebral cortex of subtypes of muscarinic receptors was investigated by using as a receptor-mediated functional response the release of neurotransmitters from isolated nerve endings. Synaptosomes prelabeled with [3H]choline or [3H]dopamine were depolarized with 15 mM KCl. Acetylcholine (ACh) concentration-dependently decreased the release of [3H]ACh and increased that of [3H]dopamine. Both actions of ACh were counteracted by the classical muscarinic antagonists atropine and quinuclidinyl benzylate. The two antagonists did not discriminate between the muscarinic presynaptic receptors sited on cholinergic terminals (muscarinic autoreceptors) and those located on dopamine nerve endings (muscarinic heteroreceptors). The apparent affinity (pA2) values for the two receptors were: 8.41 and 8.57 with atropine and 8.55 and 8.34 with quinuclidinyl benzylate. However, other muscarinic antagonists behaved differently. Dicyclomine strongly antagonized ACh at the heteroreceptors (pA2 = 8.69), whereas it was ineffective at the autoreceptors when tested at 5 microM. Pirenzepine had a similar behavior, although its affinity at the heteroreceptors was lower (pA2 = 6.33). In contrast, secoverine antagonized ACh at the autoreceptors with an affinity (pA2 = 7.58) higher than that showed at the heteroreceptors (pA2 = 6.51). The data support the existence in the frontal cortex of muscarinic receptors that are located on different neurons, mediate different functional responses and are pharmacologically distinguishable.", 
    "48": "Biotransformations of chiral 1,4-benzodiazepine-2-ones, (S)- and (R)-1 (7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-3 (S and R)-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) in untreated and phenobarbital-pretreated rats were investigated. In urine, a 4'-oxygenated metabolite (compound 2) was identified as the biotransformation product from both enantiomers, (S)-2 being present in much higher amounts than (R)-2. Unchanged parent compounds were not found in urine. In plasma, 3'- and 4'-oxygenated metabolites were identified after administration of (S)-1 and (R)-1, respectively. The metabolite possessing an R-configuration was present in much lower amounts. The maximum concentrations of (R)-1 in plasma, following a single dose, was about 6 time as high as the maximum plasma concentration of (S)-1. Faster biotransformation and elimination of (S)-1 is assumed to be the explanation of these findings.", 
    "49": "Brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAERs) have been studied in five patients suffering from Lafora-type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy proven by skin biopsy and in ten healthy volunteers. At the time of examination the patients were not taking benzodiazepines and showed myoclonic jerks. In all patients the central conduction time (interpeak latencies I-V, I-III, III-V) and the amplitude (amplitude ratio I/V) of BAERs were within the +/- 2 S.D. limits of the normal values. Since Lafora disease is a neuropathologically prevalent grey-matter illness (typical inclusion bodies are stored intraneuronally) these data indicate that diseases primarily affecting the brainstem grey-matter are usually associated with normal BAERs.", 
    "50": "The effects of FG 7142, CGS 8216 and Ro 15-1788, three compounds that are believed to produce anxiety by an action at benzodiazepine receptors in the CNS, are investigated on the plasma corticosterone concentrations in the rat both in the home cage and after exposure to novelty stress. FG 7142 (5 mg/kg) and CGS 8216 (10 mg/kg), but not Ro 15-1788 (4 or 10 mg/kg) increased basal corticosterone levels in the home cage, and all three compounds potentiated the increase in corticosterone concentrations observed after exposure to a novel environment. The relationship between the effects of drugs on corticosterone concentrations and on anxiety is considered in the light of these results.", 
    "51": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists on the in vitro binding of several ligands which label different recognition sites of the GABA benzodiazepine receptor complex are summarized. Also, results with a novel biochemical in vitro functional model of the GABA benzodiazepine receptor complex are presented. They are compatible with the concept that drugs which act on benzodiazepine receptors can lead to a bidirectional modulation of the gain of GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "52": "This paper describes the EEG profiles, observed in rabbits, of drugs which affect GABA synaptic activity at GBB complex. Drugs which enhance GABA synaptic activity induce sedation associated with EEG synchronization. However, muscimol, THIP, GHB and baclofen induce signs of CNS stimulation (light tremors of the forelimbs, chewing, light nystagmus and hyperpnea) associated with EEG spikes. Signs of light stimulation (chewing and jerks of the head) also occur after BDZs and barbiturates, and are associated with the presence of 12-24 and 20-25 Hz waves, respectively. Drugs which reduce GABA synaptic activity (bicuculline, inverse BDZ agonists, PTZ, picrotoxin and Ro 5-3663) induce three dose-dependent stages of EEG changes: trains of slow waves, trains of spike-and-wave complexes and paroxysmal activity in the rostral encephalic structures without apparent changes of the electrical activity in the spinal cord. The first two stages are associated with a behavioral state of alert and the third stage with tonico-clonic convulsions. Among the inverse BDZ agonists, DMCM and beta-CCM elicit all three stages, whereas FG 7142 and beta-CCE induce only the first two and CGS 8216 only the first. The BDZ antagonists Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-3505 (0.2-30 mg/kg IV) do not significantly affect the EEG pattern. However, they selectively inhibit the effects of diazepam and of the inverse BDZ agonists. In both cases, the inhibition is observed with doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg IV and leads to an EEG desynchronization. The possible involvement of the modifications of GABA synaptic activity in the etiology of both petit mal and grand mal epilepsies is discussed.", 
    "53": "It has been reported that pentobarbital facilities binding to benzodiazepine receptors binding at anesthetic concentrations and that this action may play a role in the anesthetic potency of this barbiturate. The interaction between pentobarbital and benzodiazepine receptors was tested with Ro 15-1788 which is reported to be a pure benzodiazepine antagonist and 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline (3-HMC), an antagonist which has inverse activity alone. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) were measured in rats after injections of pentobarbital with and without the antagonists. Pentobarbital produced dose-dependent decreases in cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption at 15 and 30 mg/kg. The antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) stimulated cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption alone but did not alter the cerebral depression produced by pentobarbital. The cerebral metabolic stimulation produced by Ro 15-1788 was unexpected since the drug is reported to be a pure antagonist without agonistic activity, but the lack of effect on pentobarbital-induced cerebral depression is consistent with other reports. 3-Hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline at 10 mg/kg did not stimulate cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption but significantly antagonized the decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption produced by 15 mg/kg pentobarbital. 3-Hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline had no significant effect on decreases in cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption produced by phenobarbital, a barbiturate which is reported not to alter binding to benzodiazepine receptors. The ability of 3-HMC to antagonize the effects of pentobarbital would be consistent with an action of both drugs at the benzodiazepine receptor but not by altering binding to an endogenous receptor.", 
    "54": "There is increasing evidence to suggest that kappa opiate receptors may be importantly involved in the mediation of feeding responses in the rat. A series of experiments is reported in which the effects of four kappa receptor agonists (ethylketocyclazocine, U-50,488H, tifluadom, bremazocine) on the consumption of a highly palatable diet were investigated. Under one condition, non-deprived male rats were administered drug treatments before a 30 min feeding test. Bremazocine (0.1 mg/kg) and ethylketocyclazocine (3.0 mg/kg) both significantly decreased the level of food consumption. In contrast, U-50,488H and tifluadom each produced significant increases in food intake. In a second condition, non-deprived male rats were first allowed to consume some of the palatable diet to achieve partial satiation, prior to the administration of the drug treatments. In this case, evidence for hyperphagic effects of all four kappa agonists was obtained, within the first 30 min access to the palatable diet. Thus, hyperphagia occurred with 0.01 mg/kg bremazocine and 0.1 mg/kg ethylketocyclazocine. We conclude that some kappa agonists have mixed stimulant/inhibitory effects on food intake, whereas others are more consistent in producing hyperphagia. In neither condition did morphine (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) show any hyperphagic effect. Our data support an involvement of kappa opiate receptors in mechanisms which control palatable food consumption in non-deprived rats.", 
    "55": "The density of benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor binding sites was lower in the midbrain of seizure-susceptible gerbils compared to control seizure-resistant gerbils. Binding of [3H]diazepam to high-affinity brain-specific sites in membrane homogenates of gerbil brain showed a 20-30% lower binding in midbrain (but not other regions) in adult seizure-susceptible gerbils than in controls. This binding deficit was localized by tissue slice autoradiography with [3H]flunitrazepam to the substantia nigra and mesencephalic periaqueductal gray regions, while higher binding was observed in the interpeduncular nucleus. These differences were also seen in animals sacrificed immediately after a seizure. A parallel deficit of [3H]bicuculline methochloride binding to low-affinity gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors also was seen in the same midbrain regions. Scatchard plot analysis showed that the benzodiazepine binding deficit in the nigra was due to a lower number of binding sites with not significant difference in affinity. Lower [3H]flunitrazepam binding was likewise seen in younger animals (29% lower at 30 days of age, 38% at 60 days, and 21% at 90 days), indicating that the midbrain receptor deficit is present in the seizure-susceptible gerbil prior to the age of onset of seizures at 50-100 days. Therefore, these changes are not likely to result from seizures but reflect genetically determined biochemical differences that could play a role in the expression of seizure susceptibility. The deficit in midbrain benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in the seizure-susceptible gerbil would be consistent with the hypothesis that a deficit of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition might contribute to some kinds of epilepsy.", 
    "56": "CGS 9896, a pyrazoloquinoline that potently binds to benzodiazepine receptors, has been reported to have anticonflict activity in conventional footshock paradigms and to antagonize pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. In the present experiments, the pentylenetetrazol discriminative cue was blocked by CGS 9896 with a potency comparable to that of diazepam. CGS 9896 also selectively lengthened the latency to terminate self-initiated brain stimulation reward. These procedures extend the anxiolytic activity of CGS 9896 to models that do not rely upon footshock-induced conflict. CGS 9896 did not impair the traction reflex in mice, did not impair rotorod performance in rats, did not reduce unpunished operant responding and decreased motor activity only slightly, indicating no distinguishable sedation or muscle relaxation in rodent models. In fact, diazepam-induced rotorod impairment was blocked by CGS 9896. The anticonvulsant effects of CGS 9896, as indicated by audiogenic seizure and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure studies, were substantial but were weaker than those of diazepam, possibly because of the muscle relaxant component of diazepam. Ethanol-induced motor impairment was potentiated more markedly by diazepam than by CGS 9896. Mixed agonist-antagonist properties of CGS 9896 therefore emerge when a comprehensive battery of behavioral assessments is utilized. CGS 9896 may have clinical anxiolytic activity without sedation or muscle relaxation.", 
    "57": "Quantitative radiohistochemistry was utilized to study alterations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors in the kindling model of epilepsy. The radioligands used for GABA and benzodiazepine receptors were [3H] muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam, respectively. GABA receptor binding was increased by 22% in fascia dentata of the hippocampal formation but not in neocortex or substantia nigra of kindled rats. Within fascia dentata, GABA receptor binding was increased to an equivalent extent in stratum granulosum and throughout stratum moleculare; no increase was found in dentate hilus or stratum lacunosummoleculare or stratum radiatum of CA1. The increased binding was present at 24 hr but not at 28 days after the last kindled seizure. The direction, anatomic distribution, and time course of the increased GABA receptor binding were paralleled by increased benzodiazepine receptor binding. Unexpectedly, GABA receptor-mediated enhancement of benzodiazepine receptor binding was slightly attenuated in fascia dentata of kindled compared to control rats. The anatomic distribution of the increased GABA receptor binding is consistent with a localization to somata and dendritic trees of dentate granule cells. We suggest that increased GABA and benzodiazepine receptor binding may contribute to enhanced inhibition of dentate granule cells demonstrated electrophysiologically in kindled animals.", 
    "58": "\"New generation\" antidepressants are generally considered to include all agents introduced in recent years which are neither tricyclic in structure nor monoamine oxidase inhibitors. They include the tetracyclics (mianserin and maprotiline), the bicyclic serotonergic compounds (fluoxetine and citalopram), and the unicyclics (bupropion), as well as the triazolobenzodiazepine derivatives (alprazolam), the triazolopyridines (trazodone) and the tetrahydroisoquinolines (nomifensine). Methodologic and economic considerations have hampered attempts to develop agents with significantly greater specificity or safety than traditional agents. Traditional agents, while lacking specificity, do have extensive records of efficacy and long-term safety and are usually less expensive than new agents. Patients not responding to traditional agents often have medical or characterologic problems that exclude them from participating in controlled studies of new agents. These problems are discussed and potential approaches to the development of new agents are presented.", 
    "59": "This study was undertaken to investigate the possibility of an allosteric interaction between benzodiazepine receptors and the CNS nucleoside transport system. Irreversible (photoaffinity) labelling of the benzodiazepine receptors in guinea pig cortical membranes resulted in a marked reduction in the binding (Bmax) of both [3H]flunitrazepam (71%) and [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (22%) to the benzodiazepine receptors but had no effect on the binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine to the nucleoside transport system. Furthermore, although photoaffinity labelling resulted in a significant decrease in the affinities of flunitrazepam (approximately equal to 16-fold) and dipyridamole (approximately equal to sevenfold) for the [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding site of the benzodiazepine receptor complex, the affinities of these compounds for the nucleoside transport system were unaltered. These results suggest that the CNS nucleoside transport system and the benzodiazepine receptor complex are distinct, noninteractive ligand recognition sites.", 
    "60": "Regional blood flows and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) were measured following alcohol withdrawal in alcohol-dependent rats. In addition, the authors tested the ability of midazolam (0.057, 0.575, or 5.75 mg X kg-1) to modify alcohol-induced changes. Rats received a 3-week treatment of daily ad libitum access to a liquid diet containing 6.54% ethanol or a sham treatment with the same caloric intake but with white dextrin substituted for alcohol. Regional blood flow was measured 12 h after alcohol withdrawal with radioactive microspheres. Nitrous oxide (70% in oxygen) was used as the control anesthetic. Rats withdrawn from alcohol treatment had significantly increased heart rate, cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) (39 +/- 8%, mean +/- SE), and CMRO2 (41 +/- 9%) compared with sham-treated rats (P less than 0.05). Subcortical CBF (49 +/- 8%), myocardial (52 +/- 18%), and hepatic arterial blood flow (298 +/- 47%) also were increased in alcohol-withdrawn rats. Renal blood flow decreased 47 +/- 5%, while skeletal muscle and small intestinal blood flow were not significantly different between the two groups. Midazolam infusion decreased CBF, CMRO2, and hepatic arterial blood flow in alcohol-withdrawn rats to similar levels as sham-treated rats and increased renal blood flow in both groups. Skeletal muscle and intestinal tissues showed no change in blood flow in response to midazolam. The authors conclude that midazolam may be effective in lowering blood pressure and brain metabolism and reversing regional blood flow changes produced by alcohol withdrawal in the rat.", 
    "61": "Seventy-three patients who had taken a deliberate overdose were seen over a six-week period. Self poisoning was found to be most common in females aged 20 to 29 years and in the unemployed (60%). Most patients had also taken alcohol (63%). The benzodiazepines were the most common drug taken (56%) and most drugs taken were prescribed by the patient's General Practitioner (G.P.) (81%). One-third of those involved had consulted their G.P. within one week of taking the overdose and 40 per cent had a history of previous self poisoning. Eighty-six per cent were admitted to the wards directly from the casualty department and of these, three-quarters were referred for a psychiatric opinion. Fourteen per cent of all patients seen were admitted for further treatment to a psychiatric hospital.", 
    "62": "Intracisternally administered cholecystokinin produced long lasting hypothermia in mice, and the hypothermic effect was significantly antagonized by benzodiazepines like chlordiazepoxide and diazepam and by a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, that were administered intraperitoneally. Proglumide, a cholecystokinin antagonist, failed to prevent the hypothermia induced by cholecystokinin at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Benzodiazepines and Ro 15-1788 revealed a considerably strong hypothermic effect, but they still prevented the hypothermic effect of cholecystokinin. The precise mechanism of the antagonism between cholecystokinin and benzodiazepines remains unclear at present.", 
    "63": "The contractile response of the guinea-pig gallbladder to cholecystokinin (CCK) and acetylcholine (ACh) was irreversibly inhibited by 5 X 10(-5) M dibenamine, and the dibenamine-induced inhibition in the CCK response was prevented by 10(-4) M chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and diazepam (DZP), but not by 10(-2) M proglumide or 10(-6) M atropine. The dibenamine-induced inhibition in the ACh response was prevented by 10(-6) M atropine, but not by 10(-4) M CDP. These findings suggest that the binding of CCK to the CCK receptor can be inhibited by benzodiazepines.", 
    "64": "A sensitive and specific gas chromatographic method, using an electron capture detector, for the measurement of plasma concentrations of loprazolam (HR-158) is described. Retention times of the hydrolysis product of loprazolam (2-amino-2'-chloro-5-nitrobenzophenone) and of the internal standard (2-amino-2'-fluorobenzophenone) were, respectively, 9 and 7 minutes. The sensitivity of the assay was 1.0 ng ml-1 of plasma, and for drug concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 15 ng ml-1 the mean recovery from plasma was 94.4 per cent and the mean coefficient of variation 9.8 per cent. This method was used to determine some pharmacokinetic parameters of loprazolam after administration of 2 X 1 mg capsule doses to nine healthy, fasted volunteers. The mean t 1/2 was 6.4 h, mean AUC infinity 65.42 ng.h ml-1, and the mean clearance 0.51 l min-1.", 
    "65": "Two antipsychotic drugs, flumezapine and zotepine, resembled clozapine, not spiperone, in not acting synergistically with amfonelic acid to elevate striatal concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in rats. Since flumezapine, zotepine and clozapine antagonize 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors with potency similar to their potency in antagonizing dopamine receptors, the possibility that 5-HT receptor blockade prevented their synergism with amfonelic acid was considered. Methiothepin, a potent 5-HT antagonist and dopamine antagonist, mimicked spiperone in causing a marked increase in striatal DOPAC in amfonelic acid-treated rats, indicating that 5-HT antagonism is not involved in the lack of synergism of flumezapine and zotepine with amfonelic acid.", 
    "66": "The gastric antisecretory effects of two dose levels of pirenzepine given at night were investigated in a group of healthy male volunteers. Compared with placebo, three days of treatment with pirenzepine 100 mg nocte or 150 mg nocte inhibited mean nocturnal intragastric acidity by 54% and 53%, respectively (p less than 0.01). The volume of gastric juice secreted was reduced by 47% and 52% (p less than 0.005), by 100 mg and 150 mg nocte, respectively. Each dose suppressed mean gastric acid output by 67% (p less than 0.001). Pepsin output was not significantly altered. There were no differences in effect between the two dose levels studied, but side-effects such as dry mouth were only seen with the higher dose. Pirenzepine 100 mg is the optimum dose which can conveniently be given at night. This will limit side-effects, and may be a useful treatment for patients with duodenal ulcer.", 
    "67": "There is evidence to suggest that several different groups of drugs including the so-called coronary vasodilators, benzodiazepines, and calcium channel inhibitors may owe their vasoactivity, in part, to the potentiation of the vasorelaxant effects of endogenous adenosine. To measure the affinity of some of these agents for the membrane-located nucleoside transport system, competition binding assays have been performed using the high-affinity radioligand [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). Experiments were performed on human erythrocytes and cardiac membranes from guinea pigs and rats. Recognized nucleoside transport inhibitors had high affinity (less than 50 nM) for NBMPR recognition sites associated with the nucleoside transporter complex in human erythrocytes, whereas calcium channel inhibitors and benzodiazepines had predominantly low affinity (greater than 1 microM). Although some recognized transport inhibitors, such as dipyridamole, show marked differences in affinity for NBMPR sites in guinea pig and rat tissues, benzodiazepines and calcium channel blockers displayed no such species selectivity and had low affinity (greater than 1 microM) for NBMPR sites in both guinea pig and rat cardiac membranes. Consequently, it is unlikely that agents such as benzodiazepines and calcium channel inhibitors cause significant inhibition of adenosine transport, and hence potentiate adenosine actions, at the concentrations required to induce effects through occupation of their respective, specific high-affinity sites.", 
    "68": "The effects of six nightly doses of temazepam (20 mg), nitrazepam (10 mg) and placebo on saccadic eye movements, critical flicker fusion, choice reaction time and on subjective feelings were studied in a double blind cross-over study in eight volunteers. Testing was performed on nights 1 and 6 of treatment. Nitrazepam, a benzodiazepine with a long elimination half-life produced a residual performance impairment on night 1 that had disappeared by night 6, despite higher serum concentrations of the drug on the sixth night of treatment. Temazepam, with a shorter elimination half-life produced no significant performance impairment on night 1, but by night 6 a significant impairment of saccadic eye movements (P less than 0.05), was seen 1 h after drug intake. We conclude that tolerance developed to the sedative action of nitrazepam over the 6 night period of the study. No evidence of tolerance was seen with temazepam.", 
    "69": "The use of opioid analgesia in the awake, spontaneously breathing patient has not yet been published as an alternative to general anaesthesia or epidural analgesia. 297 patients were treated by injecting on demand up to 0.9 mg of fentanyl intravenously to abolish the considerable pain which is caused by extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy. In contrast to its alternatives, fentanyl analgesia had no effect on circulatory parameters when the patients were immersed in a bath at 37 degrees C. Arterial gas analysis showed only a slight increase in paCO2 values and a remarkably constant paO2 if oxygen was added to inhaled air. Breathing of pure air caused a dramatic decrease of paO2 6 to 15 minutes after the administration of the loading dose of fentanyl. The method is only practicable if the patient stays awake and is awakened whenever he is at the point of falling asleep.", 
    "70": "The effects were investigated of three putative anxiolytics, thought to act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, on basal corticosterone and novelty-induced rise in plasma corticosterone concentrations. The two phenylquinolines, PK 8165 and PK 9084, increased basal concentrations, but reduced the novelty-induced rise in corticosterone; these actions resemble those found with high doses of benzodiazepines. Tracazolate, a pyrazolopyridazine that enhances the binding of benzodiazepines to their receptors, was without significant effect in either situation.", 
    "71": "Clinical trials have demonstrated that buspirone (BuSpar) is effective in the treatment of anxiety with efficacy and dosage comparable to diazepam or chlorazepate. Buspirone has a unique structure and a pharmacologic profile which distinguishes it from the benzodiazepines. Because it lacks the anticonvulsant, sedative, and muscle-relaxant properties associated with other anxiolytics, buspirone has been termed \"anxioselective.\" Animal studies suggest that it lacks potential for abuse, and this finding is supported by clinical investigations. Further preclinical work supports the contention that buspirone lacks liability to produce physical dependence or to significantly interact with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. Moreover, biochemical investigations have not identified any direct interaction of buspirone with the benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acid-chloride ionophore complex. Pharmacologic studies on the molecular level indicate that buspirone interacts with dopamine and serotonin receptors. Recent behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical studies have clearly demonstrated that early hypotheses that buspirone might be considered a neuroleptic are no longer tenable. Recent evidence indicates that other neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine) mediate buspirone's effects. It is hoped that future studies can define the mechanism by which buspirone alleviates the clinical manifestations of anxiety.", 
    "72": "This paper reviews selected aspects of benzodiazepine binding site heterogeneity. These include receptor heterogeneity revealed by biochemical determinations of receptor numbers, autoradiographic localization in histological sections of brain, lesion studies, solubilization of receptors, and photoaffinity labelling. The data summarized support the concept of benzodiazepine receptor multiplicity. In addition, we have reviewed recent work on peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites and suggest that further study of these sites may increase our understanding of both the central and peripheral actions of benzodiazepines and other ligands.", 
    "73": "Pyrazolopyridines (PZP's) in general represent a chemically unique class of non-sedative anxiolytic agents. Tracazolate (ICI 136,753) is a member of pyrazolopyridine series that has shown anxiolytic properties in animal models. Tracazolate demonstrates a wider separation between sedative and therapeutic doses than do benzodiazepines. In addition, tracazolate appears to cause fewer adverse interactions than the benzodiazepines in combination with barbiturates and alcohol. In interaction studies, tracazolate potentiated both the antimetrazol and anticonflict effects of chlordiazepoxide. Pyrazolopyridines cause enhancement of both 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FLU) and 3H-GABA to their binding sites in brain. The enhancement of 3H-FLU binding by PZP's and GABA are additive and reversed by bicuculline. The enhancement of 3H-GABA binding by PZP's and benzodiazepines are additive and reversed by picrotoxin. It is hypothesized that the action of PZP's, and particularly tracazolate, may be related to their effects upon a GABA-stimulated chloride ionophore site. Finally, benzodiazepine antagonists (e.g., RO-15 1788) fail to reverse either the anxiolytic properties of 3H-FLU enhancers or their 3H-GABA binding enhancement effects. In contrast, benzodiazepine antagonists readily reverse the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines which cause 3H-FLU displacement. These data suggest that tracazolate, a non-benzodiazepine, has a pharmacological profile suggestive of novel anxiolytic activity."
