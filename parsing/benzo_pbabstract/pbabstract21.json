In order to apply this model correctly, it is essential to understand the time course of regional flow changes and of the development of penumbra and infarction.", 
    "1": "Multitracer micro-PET of ET1 focal ischemia in rats was performed using [11C]-flumazenil ([11C]FMZ) as a flow- and viability tracer and [18F]-fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) as hypoxia marker in order to characterize the physiological time-course of this model. Nine adult Sprague-Dawley rats received stereotaxic injections of ET1 into the right primary motor cortex, 3 served as controls. PET imaging was started 2, 3 and 20 h after the last ET1 injection. Histology was obtained at the end of the scans. Standardized uptake value ratios reflecting cerebral blood flow (CBF), [11C]FMZ-binding and [18F]FMISO-retention were calculated for the region of hypoperfusion and the normoperfused cortex.",

Brain may be exposed to hypoxia due to supply-demand imbalance of oxygen not only in general anesthesia procedures but also in sedation practices. The aim of the study is to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol which are widely used agents for pediatric catheterization procedures on brain oxygen saturation using Fore-Sight.",

    "8": "The pharmacological activation of the cholesterol-binding Translocator Protein (TSPO) leads to an increase of endogenous steroids and neurosteroids determining benefic pleiotropic effects in several pathological conditions, including anxiety disorders. The relatively poor relationship between TSPO ligand binding affinities and steroidogenic efficacies prompted us to investigate the time (Residence Time, RT) that a number of compounds with phenylindolylglyoxylamide structure (PIGAs) spends in contact with the target. Here, given the poor availability of TSPO ligand kinetic parameters, a kinetic radioligand binding assay was set up and validated for RT determination using a theoretical mathematical model successfully applied to other ligand-target systems. TSPO ligand RT was quantified and the obtained results showed a positive correlation between the period for which a drug interacts with TSPO and the compound ability to stimulate steroidogenesis. Specifically, the TSPO ligand RT significantly fitted both with steroidogenic efficacy (Emax) and with area under the dose-response curve, a parameter combining drug potency and efficacy. A positive relation between RT and anxiolytic activity of three compounds was evidenced. In conclusion, RT could be a relevant parameter to predict the steroidogenic efficacy and the in vivo anxiolytic action of new TSPO ligands.", 
    "9": "There is growing recognition that anxiety disorders have a greater impact on quality of life in Parkinson's disease than motor symptoms. Yet, little is known about the pathophysiology underlying this non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease which poses a considerable barrier in developing effective treatment strategies. Here, we administered diazepam to hemiparkinsonian and non-parkinsonian rats and assessed its efficacy in three anxiety behavioral tests. At present, no information about this exists in preclinical research with sparse data in the clinical literature. Moreover, diazepam is an acute anxiolytic which makes this drug a suitable research tool to unmask differences in anxiety-like behavior. Using the unilateral, medial forebrain bundle 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease, we noted that hemiparkinsonian rats had more baseline anxiety-like behavior with 60% of them exhibiting high anxiety (HA) behavior in the elevated plus maze. In contrast, 41% of sham-lesioned rats and 8% of na\u00efve rats exhibited HA behavior. Next, we employed the elevated plus maze and noted that diazepam (1.5mg/kg) was anxiolytic in low anxiety (LA) sham-lesioned (p=0.006) and HA sham-lesioned rats (p=0.016). Interestingly, diazepam was anxiolytic for LA hemiparkinsonian rats (p=0.017), but not for HA hemiparkinsonian rats (p=0.174) despite both groups having similar motor impairment and parkinsonian phenotype. Overall, diazepam administration unmasked differences in anxiolytic efficacy between HA hemiparkinsonian rats, LA hemiparkinsonian rats and non-parkinsonian rats. Our data suggests that neuro-circuits involved in anxiety-like behavior may differ within these groups and posits that diazepam may have reduced efficacy in certain individuals with PD anxiety disorders.",

In this study, rats were administered 5mg/kg/day of chlorpyrifos (CPF) for 6 months commencing at 3-months-of-age. The animals were examined 7 months later (at 16-months-of-age) for spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and locomotor activity. In addition, we assessed the chronic effects of CPF on glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) function using pharmacological challenges with dizocilpine (MK801) and diazepam. Impaired performance related to altered search patterns, including thigmotaxis and long-term spatial memory was noted in the MWM in animals exposed to CPF, pointing to dietary CPF-induced behavioral disturbances, such as anxiety. Twenty-four hours after the 31st session of repeated acquisition task, 0.1mg/kg MK801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected for 4 consecutive days. Decreased latencies in the MWM in the control group were noted after two sessions with MK801 treatment. Once the MWM assessment was completed, animals were administered 0.1 or 0.2mg/kg of MK801 and 1 or 3mg/kg of diazepam i.p., and tested for locomotor activity. Both groups, the CPF dietary and control, displayed analogous performance in motor activity. In conclusion, our data point to a connection between the long-term spatial memory, thigmotaxic response and CPF long after the exposure ended.",

Various reports of disturbances in glucose metabolism in the form of new onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, acute pancreatitis, and increased adiposity have been reported. We present a case of new onset diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient without a history of glucose intolerance who was being treated with olanzapine for bipolar disorder. He presented in hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar, hyperketotic state with hyperkalemia, and peaked T waves on electrocardiogram. He was treated with vigorous intravenous hydration, insulin, and kaexylate which stabilized his metabolic profile. He was discontinued off of his olanzapine and started on resperidol for his bipolar disorder. Over the course of 6 months, the patient was discontinued off of his insulin and has been doing well on his follow-up appointments. This case highlights the necessity of close blood glucose monitoring of patient on atypical antipsychotic medications irrespective of their diabetic status.", 
    "28": "A previously identified, non-peptidic oxytocin (OT) receptor agonist WAY-267,464 (1) and nine novel derivatives (3, 4a-7a, 4b-7b) were synthesised and evaluated in\u00a0vitro with the aim of systematically exploring hydrogen bonding interactions and ligand flexibility. All analogues were subjected to competition radioligand binding assays at human oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin 1a (V1a) receptors. Physiological activity was determined using whole cell IP1 accumulation assays. Under these conditions, WAY-267,464 had higher affinity for the V1a receptor compared to the OT receptor (8.5x more selective) with poor functional selectivity (2x selective for OT receptor agonism over V1a receptor antagonism). Methylation of the resorcinol moiety (3) reversed the OT receptor pharmacological profile, removing agonist activity and inducing antagonist activity, without altering V1a receptor pharmacology. All flexible tethered derivatives removed OT receptor affinity and activity resulting in the generation of highly selective V1a receptor ligands.", 
    "29": "Translocator protein (TSPO), also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, is a highly conserved outer mitochondrial membrane protein present in specific subpopulations of cells within different tissues. In recent studies, the presumptive model depicting mammalian TSPO as a critical cholesterol transporter for steroidogenesis has been refuted by studies examining effects of Tspo gene deletion in vivo and in vitro, biochemical testing of TSPO cholesterol transport function, and specificity of TSPO-mediated pharmacological responses. Nevertheless, high TSPO expression in steroid-producing cells seemed to indicate an alternate function for this protein in steroidogenic mitochondria. To seek an explanation, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TSPO knockout steroidogenic MA-10 Leydig cell (MA-10:Tspo\u0394/\u0394) clones to examine changes to core mitochondrial functions resulting from TSPO deficiency. We observed that 1) MA-10:Tspo\u0394/\u0394 cells had a shift in substrate utilization for energy production from glucose to fatty acids with significantly higher mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and increased reactive oxygen species production; and 2) oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and proton leak were not different between MA-10:Tspo\u0394/\u0394 and MA-10:Tspo+/+ control cells. Consistent with this finding, TSPO-deficient adrenal glands from global TSPO knockout (Tspo(-/-)) mice also showed up-regulation of genes involved in FAO compared with the TSPO floxed (Tspo(fl/fl)) controls. These results demonstrate the first experimental evidence that TSPO can affect mitochondrial energy homeostasis through modulation of FAO, a function that appears to be consistent with high levels of TSPO expression observed in cell types active in lipid storage/metabolism.", 
    "30": "Comorbid anxiety with depression predicts poor outcomes with a higher percentage of treatment resistance than either disorder occurring alone. Overlap of anxiety and depression complicates diagnosis and renders treatment challenging. A vital step in treatment of such comorbidity is careful and comprehensive diagnostic assessment. We attempt to explain various psychosocial and pharmacological approaches for treatment of comorbid anxiety and depression. For the psychosocial component, we focus only on generalized anxiety disorder based on the following theoretical models: (1) \"the avoidance model\"; (2) \"the intolerance of uncertainty model\"; (3) \"the meta-cognitive model\"; (4) \"the emotion dysregulation model\"; and (5) \"the acceptance based model\". For depression, the following theoretical models are explicated: (1) \"the cognitive model\"; (2) \"the behavioral activation model\"; and (3) \"the interpersonal model\". Integration of these approaches is suggested. The treatment of comorbid anxiety and depression necessitates specific psychopharmacological adjustments as compared to treating either condition alone. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered first-line treatment in uncomplicated depression comorbid with a spectrum of anxiety disorders. Short-acting benzodiazepines (BZDs) are an important \"bridging strategy\" to address an acute anxiety component. In patients with comorbid substance abuse, avoidance of BZDs is recommended and we advise using an atypical antipsychotic in lieu of BZDs. For mixed anxiety and depression comorbid with bipolar disorder, we recommend augmentation of an antidepressant with either lamotrigine or an atypical agent. Combination and augmentation therapies in the treatment of comorbid conditions vis-\u00e0-vis monotherapy may be necessary for positive outcomes. Combination therapy with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine) are specifically useful for comorbid chronic pain syndromes. Aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and other novel atypical agents may be effective as augmentations. For treatment-resistant patients, we recommend a \"stacking approach\" not dissimilar from treatment of hypertension In conclusion, we delineate a comprehensive approach comprising integration of various psychosocial approaches and incremental pharmacological interventions entailing bridging strategies, augmentation therapies and ultimately stacking approaches towards effectively treating comorbid anxiety and depression.", 
    "31": "We set out to determine the safety and efficacy of the use of three sedative regimens, namely propofol alone, propofol with benzodiazepine and/or opioids and benzodiazepine with opioids in Nigerian patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy at a Nigerian tertiary hospital.", 
    "32": "A total of 120 patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopy were assigned prospectively to one of the three treatment regimens. Patients in Group A (n = 40) received propofol alone (PRO), Group B (n = 40) received propofol with midazolam and/or fentanyl and Group C (n = 40) received opioids and midazolam (fentanyl and midazolam - conscious sedation). Study outcome measures include the level of sedation, length of the procedure, sedation/recovery time, patient satisfaction and adverse events.", 
    "33": "Patients receiving PRO alone received higher doses of PRO compared with PRO and additives (P = 0.043). The overall procedure and sedation duration were similar in both PRO containing groups but statistically significantly shorter than the conscious sedation group (P < 0.0001, P < 0.006). The recovery time was statistically shorter in the PRO additives group compared to the other two groups (P < 0.0001). While the drop in blood pressure was similar in all the groups (P = 0.227), the occurrence of hypoxaemia was higher in the PRO containing groups (P < 0.0001). Overall physicians and patients pain assessment scores were statistically different in the three groups (both P < 0.0001).", 
    "34": "Our data suggest that PRO sedation is safe when used for outpatient diagnostic colonoscopy in low-resource settings with better patients and physician satisfaction. The synergistic sedative effect of midazolam and/or opioids combined with PRO help reducing the dose of PRO used with better recovery.", 
    "35": "Although benzodiazepines and other GABAA receptors allosteric modulators are used to treat neonatal seizures, their efficacy may derive from actions on subcortical structures. Side effects of benzodiazepines in nonseizing human neonates include myoclonus, seizures, and abnormal movements. Excitatory actions of GABA may underlie both side effects and reduced anticonvulsant activity of benzodiazepines. Neocortical organotypic slice cultures were used to study: (1) spontaneous cortical epileptiform activity during early development; (2) developmental changes in [Cl(-)]i and (3) whether diazepam's anticonvulsant effect correlated with neuronal [Cl(-)]i.", 
    "36": "Epileptiform activity in neocortical organotypic slice cultures was measured by field potential recordings. Cl(-) changes during development were assessed by multiphoton imaging of neurons transgenically expressing a Cl-sensitive fluorophore. Clinically relevant concentrations of diazepam were used to test the anticonvulsant effectiveness at ages corresponding to premature neonates through early infancy.", 
    "37": "(1) Neocortical organotypic slices at days in vitro 5 (DIV5) exhibited spontaneous epileptiform activity. (2) Epileptiform event duration decreased with age. (3) There was a progressive decrease in [Cl(-)]i over the same age range. (4) Diazepam was ineffective in decreasing epileptiform activity at DIV5-6, but progressively more effective at older ages through DIV15. (5) At DIV5-6, diazepam worsened epileptiform activity in 50% of the slices.", 
    "38": "The neocortical organotypic slice is a useful model to study spontaneous epileptiform activity. Decreasing [Cl(-)]i during development correlates with decreasing duration of spontaneous epileptiform activity and increasing anticonvulsant efficacy of diazepam. We provide a potential explanation for the reports of seizures and myoclonus induction by benzodiazepines in newborn human neonates and the limited electrographic efficacy of benzodiazepines for the treatment of neonatal seizures.", 
    "39": "The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) localizes in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) of cells and is readily up-regulated under various pathological conditions such as cancer, inflammation, mechanical lesions and neurological diseases. Able to bind with high affinity synthetic and endogenous ligands, its core biochemical function resides in the translocation of cholesterol into the mitochondria influencing the subsequent steps of (neuro-)steroid synthesis and systemic endocrine regulation. Over the years, however, TSPO has also been linked to core cellular processes such as apoptosis and autophagy. It interacts and forms complexes with other mitochondrial proteins such as the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) via which signalling and regulatory transduction of these core cellular events may be influenced. Despite nearly 40 years of study, the precise functional role of TSPO beyond cholesterol trafficking remains elusive even though the recent breakthroughs on its high-resolution crystal structure and contribution to quality-control signalling of mitochondria. All this along with a captivating pharmacological profile provides novel opportunities to investigate and understand the significance of this highly conserved protein as well as contribute the development of specific therapeutics as presented and discussed in the present review.", 
    "40": "Benzodiazepines have been used clinically for more than 50 years to treat disorders such as insomnia, anxiety, and epilepsy, as well as to aid muscle relaxation and anesthesia. The therapeutic index for benzodiazepines if very high and the toxicity is low. However, their usefulness is limited by the development of either or both tolerance to most of their pharmacological actions and dependence. Tolerance develops at different rates depending on the pharmacological action, suggesting the existence of distinct mechanisms for each behavioral parameter. Alternatively, multiple mechanisms could coexist depending on the subtype of GABAA receptor expressed and the brain region involved. Because most of the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through GABAA receptor binding, adaptive alterations in the number, structure, and/or functions of these receptors may play an important role in the development of tolerance. This review is focused on the regulation of GABAA receptors induced by long-term benzodiazepine exposure and its relationship with the development of tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms behind benzodiazepine tolerance is critical for designing drugs that could maintain their efficacy during long-term treatments.", 
    "41": "The large class of CNS-depressant medications-the benzodiazepines-have been extensively used for over 50\u00a0years, anxiety disorders being one of the main indications. A substantial proportion (perhaps up to 20-30\u00a0%) of long-term users becomes physically dependent on them. Problems with their use became manifest, and dependence, withdrawal difficulties and abuse were documented by the 1980s. Many such users experience physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms on attempted cessation and may develop clinically troublesome syndromes even during slow tapering. Few studies have been conducted to establish the optimal withdrawal schedules. The usual management comprises slow withdrawal over weeks or months together with psychotherapy of various modalities. Pharmacological aids include antidepressants such as the SSRIs especially if depressive symptoms supervene. Other pharmacological agents such as the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, and the hormonal agent, melatonin, remain largely experimental. The purpose of this review is to analyse the evidence for the efficacy of the usual withdrawal regimes and the newer agents. It is concluded that little evidence exists outside the usual principles of drug withdrawal but there are some promising leads.", 
    "42": "The adult brain retains a substantial capacity for synaptic reorganization, which includes a wide range of modifications from molecular to structural plasticity. Previous reports have demonstrated that the structural remodeling of excitatory neurons seems to occur in parallel to changes in GABAergic neurotransmission. The function of neuronal inhibitory networks can be modified through GABAA receptors, which have a binding site for benzodiazepines (BZ). Although BZs are among the most prescribed drugs, is not known whether they modify the structure and connectivity of pyramidal neurons. In the present study we wish to elucidate the impact of a chronic treatment of 21 days with diazepam (2mg/kg, ip), a BZ that acts as an agonist of GABAA receptors, on the structural plasticity of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of adult mice. We have examined the density of dendritic spines and the density of axonal en passant boutons in the cingulate cortex. Although no significant changes were observed in their anxiety levels, animals treated with diazepam showed a decrease in the density of spines in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Most GFP-expressing en passant boutons in the upper layers of the cingulate cortex had an extracortical origin and no changes in their density were detected after diazepam treatment. These results indicate that the chronic potentiation of GABAergic synapses can induce the structural remodeling of postsynaptic elements in pyramidal neurons.", 
    "43": "The goal of this study is to report on the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a chronic disabling condition that often presents during childhood and adolescence. Reports on adults using clonazepam for the treatment of OCD are more numerous than on children. Clonazepam as an augmentative treatment in OCD is still controversial. Our aim is to illustrate in a case report the efficacy of clonazepam as an augmentative treatment for severe childhood onset OCD. We report on the case of a young teenage girl with an extremely severe form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (score of 32 on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale), who, after a mild improvement with a combination of serotonin recapture inhibitors and second generation antipsychotics at high doses, has responded to clonazepam (3mg/day) augmentation of sertraline (200mg/day) and olanzapine (15mg/day). Clonazepam was effective not only in reducing anxiety symptoms, but also in lowering compulsions and obsessions frequency within 6 weeks with a drop in the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale of 16 points. It may be asserted that clonazepam could be useful in the initial stage for severe OCD in young patients.",

These enzymes are some of the key mediators of cellular functions in the body and hence are attractive sites for drug-induced modulations. With the finding that Tofisopam, a new anxiolytic, inhibits PDEs, the authors were inspired to look into the role of PDE and drugs acting on them in psychiatry. Hence, the review was undertaken. We found several research materials available highlighting the role of PDE in cellular functions and the possible newer etiological mechanisms of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression/anxiety disorders, and cognitive dysfunction involving PDEs. We also found that there are many molecules acting on PDEs, which have the potential to alter the way we treat mental illnesses today. This article is intended to provide an in-depth look at these enzymes so that more cost-effective therapeutic molecules may be synthesized and marketed in India for managing mental illnesses.",

It provides the clinician with a guide to all the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved hypnotics (benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines, ramelteon, low dose sinequan, and suvorexant) including potential side effects. Frequently, chronic insomnia lasts longer than 2 years. Cognizant of this and as a result of longer-term studies, the FDA has approved all hypnotics since 2005 without restricting the duration of use. Our manuscript also reviews off-label hypnotics (sedating antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and antihistamines) which in reality, are more often prescribed than approved hypnotics. The choice of which hypnotic to choose is discussed partially being based on which segment of sleep is disturbed and whether co-morbid illnesses exist. Lastly, we discuss recent label changes required by the FDA inserting a warning about \"sleep-related complex behaviors\", e.g., sleep-driving for all hypnotics. In addition, we discuss FDA mandated dose reductions for most zolpidem preparations in women due to high zolpidem levels in the morning hours potentially causing daytime carry-over effects.",

Despite the established efficacy of antipsychotic medication, compliance to treatment is poor, particularly with oral formulation. The emergence of long acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic formulations in recent years has aimed to counteract the poor compliance rates observed and optimise long term patient outcomes.",

    "52": "A Markov model was developed to emulate the treatment pathway of a hypothetical cohort of patients initiating maintenance treatment with LAI antipsychotics. The economic analysis was conducted from a National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective over a 10 year time horizon. Efficacy and safety probabilities were derived from mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) where possible. Analyses were conducted assuming pooled dosing from randomised clinical trials included in the MTCs.",

In the deterministic analysis, AOM 400 dominated PLAI and OLAI; an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 3,686 per QALY gained was observed against RLAI. Results from the univariate sensitivity analyses highlighted the probability and cost of relapse as main drivers for cost-effectiveness. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, AOM 400 demonstrated a marginally higher probability of being cost-effective (51%) than RLAI, PLAI and OLAI (48%, 1% and 0%, respectively) at a willingness to pay threshold of GBP 20,000.", 
    "54": "The model was built to accommodate results of an adjusted MTC analysis. Furthermore the model effectively captures repercussions of deteriorating compliance to treatment by incorporating three levels of compliance with elevated risks of relapse for partial compliance and non-compliance. Limitations of the analysis include the limited number of studies incorporated in the MTC, the extrapolation of short term clinical data and the exclusion of the wider societal burden.", 
    "55": "Comparative to other atypical antipsychotics, AOM 400 represents value for money in the maintenance treatment of chronic, stable schizophrenia; however, in light of the PSA findings and comparable cost-effectiveness (i.e. against RLAI), the product profile and wider benefits of the respective treatments must be taken into account when prescribing antipsychotics.", 
    "56": "Future research should assess the use of LAI antipsychotics earlier in the disease course of schizophrenia to see whether improved compliance and outcomes shortly following the onset of psychosis has the potential to alter the disease trajectory. Moreover it should be assessed whether changes in the disease trajectory can alleviate cost and resource pressures placed on national health services.",

An association between prescription drug overdose and suicide risk has also been reported. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has expected pharmacists to act as \"gatekeepers\", facilitating early identification of individuals at high risk of prescription drug abuse including overdose, supplying medication counseling to patients, and helping to introduce these patients to appropriate medical care. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines are widely used in psychiatry. However, these drugs are prescribed not only by psychiatrists but also by other healthcare professionals including primary care physicians. Moreover, in recent years, the dispensing of prescriptions has moved rapidly from inside to outside hospitals, with prescription drugs being dispensed mainly at community pharmacies. Although all healthcare professionals including hospital pharmacists can play a role in preventing prescription drug abuse, the role of the community pharmacist is vital in addressing this problem. Formerly, community pharmacists were recognized as \"community scientists\", low-threshold accessible healthcare advisors. Now, community pharmacists should return to the role of community scientists to prevent prescription drug abuse. This article begins by reviewing the current situation of prescription drug abuse and dependence in Japan. The role of pharmacists as gatekeepers in preventing prescription drug abuse is then examined. Finally, this article discusses the effect of intervention in the form of gatekeeper training for community pharmacists.",

BZs are commonly used in several clinical areas as hypnotics or anti-anxiety drugs. However, these drugs once supplied by medical institutions often lead to abuse and dependence. Thus it is important for institutions to supply and manage BZs properly. At Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital educational activities about proper use of BZs are performed by not only medical doctors but also pharmacists. We coordinate distribution of leaflets and run an educational workshop. As a result of these activities, the number of patients receiving BZ prescriptions was reduced. Performing these activities, pharmacists were required to work for patients, doctors, and nurses; they acquired knowledge about BZs such as action mechanisms, efficacy, adverse effects, problems about co-prescription, and methods of discontinuing BZs, as well as information on coping techniques other than medication. The most important point to attend the patients is to answer their anxieties.",

A variety of mechanisms and brain sites have been proposed as contributors to the side effects; however, the role of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV), which plays a crucial role in the regulation of subdiaphragmatic organs and thus governs energy and glucose homeostasis, is largely unknown. Identifying the effect of olanzapine on the excitability of DMV neurons in both sexes is thus crucial to understanding possible underlying mechanisms. Whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings were conducted in stomach- and liver-related DMV neurons identified with retrograde viral tracers and in random DMV neurons. The effect of olanzapine on the neuronal excitability of DMV neurons both in male and female mice was established. Our data demonstrate that olanzapine hyperpolarizes the DMV neurons in both sexes and this effect is reversible. The hyperpolarization is associated with decreased firing rate and input resistance. Olanzapine also decreases the excitability of a subset of stomach- and liver-related DMV neurons. Our study demonstrates that olanzapine has a powerful effect on DMV neurons in both sexes, indicating its ability to reduce vagal output to the subdiaphragmatic organs, which likely contributes to the metabolic side effects observed in both humans and experimental models. These findings suggest that the metabolic side effects of olanzapine may partially originate in the DMV.",

Comorbidity of anxiety and addictive disorders may be due to interdependence of these states as well as common predisposing factors and pathogenic mechanisms. There are various medicines in the treatment of anxiety associated with substance abuse, including benzodiazepines, calcium channel modulators, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, antidepressants and antipsychotics. One of the best approaches to the treatment of chronic anxiety disorders in drug treatment clinic is a long course of treatment with antidepressants, primarily with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first line preparations. Such medications as pregabalin, buspirone, etifoxine and alimemazine are also of interest for the treatment of dual diagnosis patients.",

We determined the cumulative incidences and adjusted hazard ratios of acute pancreatitis.A significant association was observed between BZD poisoning and acute pancreatitis. After adjustment for potential risk factors, the patients with BZD poisoning had a 5.33-fold increased risk of acute pancreatitis compared with the controls without BZD poisoning (HR\u200a=\u200a5.33, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a2.26-12.60).

    "119": "The short-term effects of benzodiazepines on memory are well established and are suspected in the long term. Eleven studies have been published so far concerning benzodiazepine use and the risk of dementia disorders; nine of these studies concluded these drugs have a deleterious effect, one found a protective effect, and one (the most recently published) observed no effect. The positive association found in some studies could be due to a reverse causation bias since the main indications for benzodiazepines (e.g. sleep disorders, anxiety) can also be prodromes of dementia disorders. This bias is less likely for treatments started more than 10 years before the diagnosis. Among others, three mechanisms could underlie the potential influence of benzodiazepines on the development of dementia disorders. First, benzodiazepines can decrease beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) and \u03b3-secretase activity and slow down the accumulation of A\u03b2 oligomers in the brain. This potential positive effect has never been confirmed; the same is true for the prevention of excitotoxicity through benzodiazepine anti-glutamatergic action. Second, since astrocytes located in the area of amyloid plaques could have gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-secreting activity, patients with pre-dementia lesions could be at increased risk of presenting with more pronounced deleterious cognitive effects of benzodiazepines. Finally, owing to the neural compensation and cognitive reserve concepts, some subjects could cope with initial lesions by using/developing alternative networks. By lowering the brain activation level, benzodiazepines could limit this capacity. In conclusion, it is essential that animal studies explore the mechanistic hypotheses of this association found by most of the pharmacoepidemiological studies conducted on this topic.",

Antagonists of AMPA receptors are drug candidates for potential treatment of a number of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). How to make better inhibitors, such as 2,3-BDZs, has been an enduring quest in drug discovery. Among a few available tools to address this specific question for making better 2,3-BDZs, perhaps the best one is to use mechanistic clues from studies of the existing antagonists to design and discover more selective and more potent antagonists. Here I review recent work in this area, and propose some ideas in the continuing effort of developing newer 2,3-BDZs for tighter control of AMPA receptor activities in vivo.",

Previously, we showed that ubiquitous overexpression of Glo1 reduced concentrations of MG and increased anxiety-like behavior, whereas systemic injection of MG reduced anxiety-like behavior. We further showed that MG is a competitive partial agonist at GABA-A receptors. Based on those data we hypothesized that modulation of GABAergic signaling by MG underlies Glo1 and MG's effects on anxiety-like behavior. As previous studies used ubiquitous overexpression, we sought to determine whether neuronal Glo1 overexpression was sufficient to increase anxiety-like behavior. We generated ROSA26 knock-in mice with a floxed-stop codon upstream from human Glo1 (FLOXGlo1KI) and bred them with mice expressing CRE recombinase under the direction of the Synapsin 1 promoter (Syn-CRE) to limit overexpression of Glo1 specifically to neurons. Furthermore, since previous administration of MG had been systemic, we sought to determine if direct microinjection of MG into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was sufficient to reduce anxiety-like behavior. Thus, we performed bilateral microinjections of saline, MG (12\u03bcM or 24\u03bcM), or the positive control midazolam (4mM) directly into the BLA. FLOXGlo1KIxSyn-CRE mice showed significantly increased anxiety-like behavior compared to their FLOXGLO1xWT littermates. In addition, bilateral microinjection of MG and midazolam significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior compared to saline treated mice. These studies suggest that anatomically specific manipulations of Glo1 and MG are sufficient to induce changes in anxiety-like behavior.",

Drug must enter the brain by crossing from the blood into the brain tissue, called a transvascular route (TVR).

Encapsulating the drug within a nano scale delivering system, synthesising drugs with low molecular weight are the best mechanisms to deliver the drug to the brain. But through this article, we have explored a possibility of attaching a molecule 4-(trifluoromethyl) benzoic acid (TFMBA), that possess more number of fluorine atom, to benzodiazepine (BDZ) resulting in an ionic salt (S)-(+)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine5,11(10H,11aH)-dione with 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid. By this way, reducing the toxicity of BDZ than the conventional anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), increasing the solubility, reducing the melting point, enriching the TVR with excess oxygen content with the support of fluorine. With all these important prerequisites fulfilled, the drug along with the attached molecule is expected to travel more comfortably through the TVR without any external support than any other conventional AEDs.

The aim of this study was to identify the neuroprotective effects of 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-CD), a ligand of TSPO, against amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells and its mechanisms of action. A\u03b2 decreased the viability of SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, while 4'-CD had a neuroprotective effect at the doses of 1nM and 10nM. The neuroprotective effects of 4'-CD against A\u03b2 were associated with the inhibition of A\u03b2-induced upregulation of Bax and downregulation of survivin.

The human proteome comprises 46 bromodomain-containing proteins with a total of 61 bromodomains, which, despite highly conserved structural features, recognize a wide array of natural peptide ligands. Over the past five years, bromodomains have attracted great interest as promising new epigenetic targets for diverse human diseases, including inflammation, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The demonstration in 2010 that two small molecule compounds, JQ1 and I-BET762, potently inhibit proteins of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family with translational potential for cancer and inflammatory disease sparked intense efforts in academia and pharmaceutical industry to develop novel bromodomain antagonists for therapeutic applications.

The electro-oxidation of olanzapine at the surface of the BMBPBP/CdS-quantum dots/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (BMBPBP/CdS-QDs/MWCNTs) modified gold electrode was studied using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This sensor showed an excellent electrocatalytic oxidation activity toward olanzapine at less positive potential, pronounced current response, and good sensitivity. The diffusion coefficient and kinetic parameters (such as electron transfer coefficient and the heterogeneous rate constant) were determined for olanzapine oxidation, using the electrochemical approaches. Surface morphology and electrochemical properties of the prepared modified electrode were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The hydrodynamic amperometry at rotating modified electrode at constant potential versus reference electrode was used for detection of olanzapine.

Anhydrous olanzapine was added to water with or without those polymers prior to extrusion with microcrystalline cellulose. Assessment of olanzapine conversion was made by XRP-Diffraction; FTIR spectroscopy; calorimetry (DSC) and microscopy (SEM for crystal size and shape).

Both polyvinylpyrrolidone and hydroxypropylcellulose prevented the hydrate transformations of the anhydrous drug; the latter even in the presence of hydrate seeds. This may be explained by the higher H-bond ability; higher network association and higher hydrophobicity of hydroxypropylcellulose by comparison with polyethyleneglycol and polyvinylpyrrolidone; which could contribute to its higher affinity to the crystal surfaces of the hydrate nuclei/initial crystals and promoting steric hindrance to the incorporation of other drug molecules into the crystal lattice; thus, preventing the crystal growth.

However, there are contradictory results regarding antidepressant effects of minocycline in rodent models. Additionally, the possible anxiolytic effect of minocycline is still poorly investigated. Therefore, we aimed to clarify in the present study the influence of minocycline on behavioral correlates of mood disorders in standard tests for depression and anxiety, the Porsolt Forced Swim Test (FST), Elevated O-Maze, Dark-Light Box Test and Openfield Test in adult C57BL/6 mice. We found, unexpectedly, that mice treated with minocycline (20-40mg/kg, i.p.) did not display antidepressant- or anxiolytic-like behavioral changes in contrast to mice treated with diazepam (0.5mg/kg, anxiety tests) or imipramine (20mg/kg, depressive-like behavior).

    "179": "Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a short chain fatty acid endogenously produced within the central nervous system (CNS) and acts as a precursor and metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although, it is an illegal recreational drug of abuse, its sodium salt (sodium oxybate) has been utilized as a medication for a number of medical conditions. The first aim of this review was to focus on current applications of sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy, with a particular emphasis on the key symptoms of this disorder: cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Secondly, the effectiveness of sodium oxybate therapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and the maintenance of alcohol abstinence has been assessed. Nowadays, sodium oxybate is the first-line treatment for narcolepsy and it is highly effective in meliorating sleep architecture, decreasing EDS and the frequency of cataplexy attacks in narcoleptic patients. Sodium oxybate currently finds also application in the treatment of AWS and the maintenance of alcohol abstinence in alcoholics. Most of the studies evaluating the efficacy of GHB in the treatment of AWS use a dosage of 50 mg/kg divided in three or four administrations per day. Human studies showed that GHB (dose of 50 mg/kg, divided in three administrations per day) is capable to increase the number of abstinent days, reduce alcohol craving and decrease the number of drinks per day. However, there is limited randomized evidence and, thus, GHB cannot be reliably compared to clomethiazole or benzodiazepines. Some randomized data suggest that GHB is better than naltrexone and disulfiram regarding abstinence maintenance and prevention of craving in the medium term i.e. 3-12 months. It is recommended that GHB should be used only under strict medical supervision, since concerns about the abuse/misuse of the drug and the addiction potential have been arisen.",

Although TSPO is associated with stress- and disease-related processes in organisms from bacteria to mammals, full elucidation of the functional role of the TSPO protein is lacking for most organisms in which it is found. In this study, we describe the regulation and function of a TSPO homolog in the cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon, designated FdTSPO. Accumulation of the FdTSPO transcript is upregulated by green light and in response to nutrient deficiency and stress. A F. diplosiphon TSPO deletion mutant (i.e., \u0394FdTSPO) showed altered responses compared to the wild type (WT) strain under stress conditions, including salt treatment, osmotic stress, and induced oxidative stress. Under salt stress, the FdTSPO transcript is upregulated and a \u0394FdTSPO mutant accumulates lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and displays increased growth compared to WT. In response to osmotic stress, FdTSPO transcript levels are upregulated and \u0394FdTSPO mutant cells exhibit impaired growth compared to the WT. By comparison, methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress results in higher ROS levels in the \u0394FdTSPO mutant compared to the WT strain. Taken together, our results provide support for the involvement of membrane-localized FdTSPO in mediating cellular responses to stress in F. diplosiphon and represent detailed functional analysis of a cyanobacterial TSPO. This study advances our understanding of the functional roles of TSPO homologs in vivo.",

Full validation of the method was performed following procedures described by the French standard NF T90-210. Limits of quantification between 0.14 and 3.54 ng L(-1) were obtained. Method recoveries from 71 to 123% were observed with standard deviation below 10% in intermediate precision conditions. Accuracy was determined for every compound: measurement errors were between -4 and +1% and standard deviations in intermediate precision conditions were included within a 1-9% interval. Finally, measurement uncertainties were evaluated following the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM). Expanded uncertainties (k=2) ranged from 2% for carbamazepine, EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) and venlafaxine to 17% for diazepam. The validated method was implemented to Seine river surface waters demonstrating its fitness for purpose. All compounds were detected and 22 out of 25 analytes were quantified.

    "207": "Our paper proposes a methodological strategy to select optimal sampling designs for phenotyping studies including a cocktail of drugs. A cocktail approach is of high interest to determine the simultaneous activity of enzymes responsible for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, therefore useful in anticipating drug-drug interactions and in personalized medicine. Phenotyping indexes, which are area under the concentration-time curves, can be derived from a few samples using nonlinear mixed effect models and maximum a posteriori estimation. Because of clinical constraints in phenotyping studies, the number of samples that can be collected in individuals is limited and the sampling times must be as flexible as possible. Therefore to optimize joint design for several drugs (i.e., to determine a compromise between informative times that best characterize each drug's kinetics), we proposed to use a compound optimality criterion based on the expected population Fisher information matrix in nonlinear mixed effect models. This criterion allows weighting different models, which might be useful to take into account the importance accorded to each target in a phenotyping test. We also computed windows around the optimal times based on recursive random sampling and Monte-Carlo simulation while maintaining a reasonable level of efficiency for parameter estimation. We illustrated this strategy for two drugs often included in phenotyping cocktails, midazolam (probe for CYP3A) and digoxin (P-glycoprotein), based on the data of a previous study, and were able to find a sparse and flexible design. The obtained design was evaluated by clinical trial simulations and shown to be efficient for the estimation of population and individual parameters.",

Time-dependent changes in sedation and antinociception were evaluated by measuring a sedation score based on rabbit's posture, loss of the righting, palpebral and pedal withdrawal reflexes and by instrumental monitoring of rectal temperature, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, pulse-oximetry, and capnometry. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax ) of each drug was reached within 5\u00a0min (Tmax ) from DMB-TN administration along with deep sedation and analgesia. Such effects subsided after 45\u00a0min into a moderate sedation and analgesia lasting for additional 15\u00a0min. All rabbits awakened spontaneously and uneventfully 90\u00a0min after DMB-TN administration. During the anesthetic procedure, arterial blood pressure markedly decreased and respiratory depression ensued requiring oxygen supplementation. The results of this study show that all three molecules of the DMB combination were absorbed through the TN route, inducing deep sedation and analgesia suitable for minor surgical procedures. Such combination should be used with caution in rabbits bearing cardiovascular or respiratory diseases because of its ability to induce hypotension and respiratory depression.",

The anticonvulsant potential of the complexes, labeled [(DZP)PdCl]2 and [(DZP)PdOAc]2, was evaluated through two animal models: pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)- and picrotoxin (PTX)-induced convulsions. The organometallic DZP-palladium(II) acetate complex, [(DZP)PdOAc]2, significantly increased (p<0.01 or p<0.001) latencies and protected the animals against convulsions induced by PTZ and PTX, while the analogous chloro derivative, [(DZP)PdCl]2, was effective (p<0.01) only in the PTZ model. These effects appear to be mediated through the GABAergic system. The possible mechanism of action of the DZP-palladium(II) complexes was also confirmed with the use of flumazenil (FLU), a GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex site antagonist.

A recent influenza infection recorded within 30-180 days prior to the index date yielded an adjusted 1.57 (95%CI 1.36-1.81), and an increasing number of previous influenza infections was associated with increasing odds ratios (\u2a7e 3 recorded influenza infections, adjusted OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.22-1.81).", 
    "234": "This study suggests that influenza infections are associated with a moderately increased risk of developing depression.", 
    "235": "In contrast to humans and dogs, diazepam has been reported to induce severe hepatic side effects in cats, particularly after repeated dosing. With the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this apparent sensitivity of cats to drug-induced liver injury, in a series of in vitro experiments, the feline-specific biotransformation of diazepam was studied with liver microsomes obtained from cats and dogs and the possible inhibition of the bile salt export pump (Bsep) was measured in isolated membrane vesicles overexpressing feline and canine Bsep. In line with previous in vivo studies, the phase I metabolites nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam were measurable in microsomal incubations, although enzyme velocity of demethylases and hydroxylases differed significantly between cats and dogs. In cats, the main metabolite was temazepam, which also could be glucuronidated. In contrast to dogs, no other glucuronidated metabolites could be observed. In addition, in the membrane vesicles an inhibition of the transport of the Bsep substrate taurocholic acid could be observed in the presence of diazepam and its metabolites. It was concluded that both mechanisms, the slow biotransformation of diazepam as well the inhibition of the bile acid efflux that results in an accumulation of bile acids in the hepatocytes, seem to contribute to the liver injury observed in cats following repetitive treatment with diazepam.", 
    "236": "Palliative sedation involves the use of sedative medication to relieve refractory symptoms in patients by reducing their level of consciousness. Although it is considered an acceptable clinical practice from most ethical points of view, palliative sedation is still a widely debated procedure and merits better understanding.", 
    "237": "The relevant medical literature pertaining to palliative sedation was analyzed and reviewed from various technical, relational, and bioethical perspectives.", 
    "238": "Proportionate palliative sedation is considered to be the most clinically appropriate modality for performing palliative sedation. However, guidelines must be followed to ensure that it is performed correctly. Benzodiazepines represent the first therapeutic option and careful monitoring of dosages is essential to avoid oversedation or undersedation.", 
    "239": "Proportionate palliative sedation is used to manage and relieve refractory symptoms in patients with cancer during their last days or hours of life. Evidence suggests that its use has no detrimental effect on survival. A different decision-making process is used to manage the withdrawal of hydration than the process used to determine whether proportionate palliative sedation is appropriate. Communication between patients, their relatives, and the health care staff is important during this medical intervention.", 
    "240": "Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is the major technique for diagnosis of GI disease and treatment. Various sedation and analgesia regimens such as midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol can be used during GI endoscopy. The purpose of the study was to compare propofol alone and propofol combination with midazolam and fentanyl in moderate sedation for GI endoscopy. One hundred patients undergoing GI endoscopy were enrolled in this study. All patients received a propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) to maintain sedation during the procedure. Patients were randomly allocated into either Group P (propofol TCI alone) or Group C (combination of propofol TCI plus midazolam and fentanyl). Dermographic data, anesthetic parameters (sedation regimen, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation), procedure parameters (procedure time, colonoscopy, or panendoscopy), propofol consumption, and adverse events (hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia) were all recorded. Postprocedural records included recovery time, postoperative adverse events (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, recall, and pain) and satisfaction. The average propofol consumption was 251\u00a0\u00b1\u00a083\u00a0mg in Group P and 159\u00a0\u00b1\u00a073\u00a0mg in Group C (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The incidence of transient hypotension was higher in Group P (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). The recovery time and discharge time were both shorter in Group C (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.006 respectively). Overall, postprocedural adverse events were similar in both groups. The postanesthetic satisfaction was comparable in both groups. TCI of propofol combined with midazolam and fentanyl achieved sedation with fewer hypotension episodes and shorter recovery and discharge time than propofol TCI alone in patients undergoing GI endoscopy."
