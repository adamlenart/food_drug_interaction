    "0": "Steroids have often been associated with modulation of the GABAergic system in the central nervous system, mainly in ovariectomized rats. In the present study, the effect of the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) and testosterone (T) on the density of peripheral and central benzodiazepine (BZ) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors was evaluated in the frontoparietal cortex and whole cerebellum of female rats during the peripubertal period. The density of peripheral-type BZ receptors was not altered in either of these organs, whether or not treated with DES or T. The density of central BZ and GABAA receptors in either frontoparietal cortex or whole cerebellum was significantly reduced following treatment with DES or T; however, the effect of DES was much more pronounced. The similarity of the effect of T to that of DES may suggest that the effect of T is mediated at least partially by intraovarian biosynthesis of estradiol-17 beta from the exogenously administered T. Collectively, these results may suggest that in female rats during the peripubertal period, sex steroids produce a down-regulatory effect on expression of the brain GABAA/BZ complex, in contrast to their well-established up-regulatory effect in adult ovariectomized rats.", 
    "1": "The use of diazepam in solution, administered per rectum, as an adjunct to treatment of paediatric maxillofacial injuries, has not been previously reported. Its use in a series of nine cases is described. The authors recommend this route of administration as an alternative form of management in the treatment of maxillofacial injuries in anxious children.", 
    "2": "In this study we investigated the central effects of adinazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, by means of neurophysiological techniques (electroencephalogram, EEG, and quantified analysis of EEG, QEEG). The drug has been administered at the doses of 0.1-1-10 mg/kg i.v. The evaluation of the data obtained by QEEG has demonstrated that this substance acts on the central nervous system. Particularly we observed that the drug at the middle and high doses caused an increase of the \"slow waves sleep\" EEG pattern. This preclinical study has shown that adinazolam possesses a neuropharmacological profile similar to that of atypical antidepressive and/or anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "3": "High concentrations of quinine, the drug of choice for severe malaria, are toxic to the cardiovascular system, producing hypotension and abnormal myocardial conduction.", 
    "4": "An 8 year-old girl was admitted for fever, headache and arthralgias. Examination of a thick film of blood showed Plasmodium falciparum (parasitemia: 2%). She was given quinine intravenously. Ventricular tachycardia (150/min) and status epilepticus were seen 48 hours later, necessitating ventilatory support, plasma volume expander and IV sodium thiopental. On admission to an intensive care unit, the patient had hypothermia, was comatose (stage IV) with a reactive mydriasis and bradycardia (30/min). ECG confirmed bradycardia and showed a widened QRS complex. There was also a bilateral retinal edema. The blood level of quinine was 61 mumol/liter (therapeutic levels: 6-15). Retrospective inquiry revealed that the quinine initially administered had been incorrectly diluted. The child was treated with furosemide and adrenaline, followed by dobutamine and albumin infusion. She was then given diazepam (initial dose: 2 mg/kg then 6 mg/kg/day divided into 4 doses) intravenously, plus lidocaine, methylprednisolone and glycerol. The sinusal rhythm became normal 1 hour after the first bolus of diazepam. Consciousness gradually improved over the 10 days after admission while treatment was progressively discontinued. There were no sequelae, except for a transitory bilateral blindness.",

    "6": "Sound-induced seizures in genetically epilepsy-prone rats were used to compare the anticonvulsant effect of phenytoin and diazepam with compounds which decrease glutamatergic neurotransmission including excitatory amino acid antagonists acting at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors: D(-)CPPene, CGP 37849 and MK 801 or at the glycine/NMDA site: ACPC (1-aminocyclopropane-dicarboxylic acid) (partial agonist) or non-NMDA receptors: NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]-quinoxaline.Li) and GYKI 52466 (1-(aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylene-dioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepin e.HCl) or acting at sodium channels to decrease glutamate release: lamotrigine and BW 1003C87 (5(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl)-2,4-diaminopyrimidine ethane sulphonate). ED50 values against clonic seizures (in mumol/kg at the time of peak anticonvulsant effect) were: phenytoin 30.5 (2 h), diazepam 0.5 (0.5 h), MK 801 0.01 (4 h), D(-)CPPene 1.9 (4 h), CGP 37849 2 (1 h), GYKI 52466 24 (0.25 h), NBQX 40 (0.5 h), ACPC 1053 (0.5 h), BW 1003C87 2.2 (1 h), lamotrigine 4.8 (4 h). BW 1003C87, lamotrigine, MK 801, phenytoin, diazepam and CGP 37849 had the most favourable therapeutic indices (rotarod locomotor deficit ED50/anticonvulsant ED50).", 
    "7": "To assess the importance of benzodiazepines as a risk factor for road accidents, the number of blood samples positive for these drugs was compared among injured drivers responsible for a traffic accident and among injured non-responsible drivers and pedestrians. Benzodiazepines were detected by qualitative immunoenzymatic assay. A total of 3147 subjects were registered as accident victims, of whom 2852 had a complete file, including levels of blood alcohol and benzodiazepines and degree of responsibility for the accident. Benzodiazepines were detected in the serum of 8% of the study population. Comparison of the responsible and non-responsible groups did not show any significant difference between them when the part played by alcohol was disregarded, even after adjustment for age and sex. In conclusion, this study showed, once again, that alcohol is clearly an accident risk factor, but found no statistically significant evidence that this also applies to benzodiazepines.", 
    "8": "This work investigates consumption of benzodiazepines in Brazil during the years 1988 and 1989, using the following sources of information provided to the Brazilian Ministry of Health by institutions that deal with benzodiazepines: (a) benzodiazepine stocks recorded at the beginning and end of each year; (b) Brazilian (internal) production of benzodiazepines; (c) imported and exported amounts of benzodiazepines; (d) amounts employed in the manufacture of brand-name products and in the making of prescription formulas. The records a, b and c furnished the 'calculated consumption', of benzodiazepines, in kilograms. The d records, on the other hand, directly furnished the 'informed consumption', also in kilograms. The data obtained were also expressed in terms of defined daily doses (DDDs)/1,000 inhabitants/day, considering the informed consumption and the Brazilian population. As for the DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day, they were found to be 23.03 and 18.48 for the years 1988 and 1989, respectively. A striking discrepancy was detected between the calculated and the informed consumption figures, the latter having exceeded the former by 2096 kg in 1988 and by 4909 kg in 1989. Diazepam was the primary drug responsible for this difference. Such results may suggest that an illicit, unrecorded trade of benzodiazepines is occurring in Brazil.", 
    "9": "Drug treatment of panic disorder is reviewed with focus on recent controlled studies. The efficacy of alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, and imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, has consistently been demonstrated, but there is reasonable evidence that other benzodiazepines or antidepressants might also be effective if equipotent doses are used. Most controlled studies demonstrate drug efficacy on several psychopathological symptoms, including the core symptom panic attacks. Limited evidence indicates that alprazolam may be more efficacious in treating panic attacks than avoidance behaviour, and the reverse when imipramine is concerned. Drug efficacy appears to be most consistently documented in moderately to severely ill panic patients. The benzodiazepines are better tolerated than antidepressants in terms of patient acceptance, and the improvement sets in faster with benzodiazepines. In the presence of depressive symptoms considered secondary to panic attacks and/or agoraphobia, both types of drugs appear efficacious. Difficulty discontinuing high-dose benzodiazepine treatment remains the most important side effect of the treatment but sedation can, like anticholinergic side effects of the tricyclic antidepressants, be troublesome, thereby diminishing patient compliance. The role of newly developed antidepressants with a more specific mode of action and milder side effects awaits evaluation in controlled trials.", 
    "10": "Patients who discontinue early from clinical trials frequently give ambiguous or no reasons for leaving the study. Using Cloniger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, we examined the potential role of personality traits in early discontinuation in patients with panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Early dropouts and completers were comparable at baseline on demographic and clinical variables but differed significantly on the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. For panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder patients combined, early dropouts scored higher on total novelty seeking, as well as on the novelty-seeking traits of both disorderliness/dislike of regimentation and impulsiveness. There was no significant interaction between dropout status and diagnosis for this finding, indicating it applied equally to both groups. This study suggests that personality traits involving novelty seeking may contribute to early discontinuation from clinical trials, independent of side effects, lack of efficacy, or at baseline, significantly worse symptoms of anxiety.", 
    "11": "In the submitted paper the author reviews the literature on anxiolytics during the mentioned period, based on previous reviews. He discusses the extent to which anxiolytics are used. The majority of information pertains to benzodiazepine BD anxiolytics. He provides data on treatment of anxious conditions, on the administration of anxiolytics in impaired sleep, in gerontopsychiatry and alcohology. In broader indications anxiolytics are administered also in depressions, manias and other psychoses. Attention is paid also to the risk of development of dependence on anxiolytics, tolerance and withdrawal syndromes. In the conclusion the author present information on recent non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics.", 
    "12": "Increasing awareness of treatment resistance and the emergence of tolerance on once effective medications have facilitated acceptance of a variety of novel drug combination treatment strategies. Although clinical practice is based for the most part on a literature that is still seriously lacking in well-controlled and methodologically rigorous studies, the risk-benefit ratio in most cases seems acceptable if a clear understanding of the possible therapeutic and adverse interactions on the part of both the physician and the patient prevails. Historically, drug combinations have emerged out of serendipity, but increasingly, theories of complimentary drug action serve a heuristic propose in guiding clinical research efforts, and in testing the purposed mechanisms of actions for each of the drugs separately.", 
    "13": "A simple, rapid high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed for detecting and quantifying benzodiazepines in serum. Seven major benzodiazepines were extracted from spiked serum samples using solid-phase extraction with prazepam as the internal standard. The eluted drugs were then resolved isocratically by HPLC within 11 min using a reversed-phase C8 column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, methanol, water, and perchloric acid. All drugs gave responses that varied linearly with concentration over the ranges studied. Within-day imprecision (CV) varied from 3.9 to 14.9%, day-to-day CV from 4.8 to 17.0%, absolute recoveries from 67% to 114%, and detection limits from 10 to 110 ng/mL. Tricyclic antidepressants did not interfere, and clinical results were in good agreement with those obtained by a gas chromatographic method. The advantage of this method is that it uses a salt-free isocratic mobile phase that can be easily manipulated to effect difficult benzodiazepine separations.", 
    "14": "We have developed a simple, rapid method for determination of the antiepileptic drug clobazam and its major active metabolite, norclobazam in serum. Serum (200 microL) made alkaline with sodium borate buffer is extracted with toluene. After evaporation of the organic layer and reconstitution with toluene, the extract is analyzed within 5 min by capillary gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard HP 5890A GC; 63Ni electron-capture detector; HP-5 column). Linear calibrations for clobazam and norclobazam (clobazam: r = 0.999; norclobazam: r = 0.997) have permitted automated integrator calculation of results. Imprecision and accuracy were evaluated using an in-house control. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (CV) were 6.2% (n = 10) and 9.8% (n = 21), respectively for clobazam and 5.7% (n = 10) and 6.3% (n = 21), respectively for norclobazam. The mean concentrations for clobazam and norclobazam in the control were 3.5 mumol/L and 8.7 mumol/L respectively, representing 106% and 100% of the weighed-in values. Simplicity, specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity are attributes that make this assay suitable for monitoring of clobazam and norclobazam in serum.", 
    "15": "A cross-national randomised trial of alprazolam for chronic panic disorder with agoraphobia was run. Compared with previous trials it had three new features: an exposure therapy contrast group, a six-month treatment-free follow-up, and a low rate of early placebo drop-outs ('non-evaluables'). The dose of alprazolam was high (5 mg/day). The 154 patients had eight weeks of: alprazolam and exposure (combined treatment); or alprazolam and relaxation (a psychological placebo); or placebo and exposure; or placebo and relaxation (double placebo). Drug taper was from weeks 8 to 16. Follow-up was to week 43. Results were similar at both sites. Treatment integrity was good. All four treatment groups, including double placebo, improved well on panic throughout. On non-panic measures, by the end of treatment, both alprazolam and exposure were effective, but exposure had twice the effect size of alprazolam. During taper and follow-up, gains after alprazolam were lost, while gains after exposure were maintained. Combining alprazolam with exposure marginally enhanced gains during treatment, but impaired improvement thereafter. The new features put previous trails in a fresh light. By the end of treatment, though gains on alprazolam were largely as in previous studies, on phobias and disability they were half those with exposure. Relapse was usual after alprazolam was stopped, whereas gains persisted to six-month follow-up after exposure ceased. Panic improved as much with placebo as with alprazolam or exposure.", 
    "16": "In Experiment 1, the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP), two typical antipsychotics, haloperidol (HAL) and chlorpromazine (CPZ), and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (CLZ) were evaluated for antipunishment effects in rats in a modified Geller-Seifter conflict procedure [MULT fixed interval (FI) 60-s, fixed ratio (FR) 1 (food + shock)]. In Experiment 2, CDP and thioridazine (THD) were similarly tested. CLZ (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg), but not HAL, CPZ, or THD, selectively increased punished responding, although the magnitude of effect was smaller than that observed for CDP. Possible serotonergic mechanisms for CLZ's action in this model and the possible importance of serotonergic activity for the development of other atypical antipsychotic drugs are discussed.", 
    "17": "Present knowledge of the histopathology of cutaneous changes seen in drug-induced coma is very incomplete: Only 1 of the 11 papers on this subject mentions follicular or sebaceous gland damage, with very little attention focused on vascular changes. We made a careful study of serial sections from eight cutaneous biopsy specimens from seven patients who suffered drug-induced coma with the following findings: (a) The secretory portion of the eccrine sweat coil is the epithelium most susceptible to necrosis. It is followed by, ex aequo, eccrine sweat duct, hair follicle, and sebaceous gland, and, lastly, the epidermis. (b) In the eccrine sweat duct, the outer root sheath of the hair follicle, and the epidermis, necrosis does not usually appear first in the outermost (basal cell) layer. (c) Necrosis of the outer root sheath of the telogen \"club\" follicle is usually more advanced than that of the secondary hair germ, and, at times, a spared anagen bulb can be seen in closest proximity. (d) Vascular changes correlate proportionately with epidermal damage and consist of a largely neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate and blood vessel wall damage, mainly involving arterioles. Our findings contradict the widely accepted hypothesis that pressure is the main cause of the cutaneous changes in drug-induced coma.", 
    "18": "The purposes were to show that pentobarbital administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) antagonized the antinociceptive action of morphine given intrathecally in the tail-flick test in mice, determine whether this antagonistic action involved spinal release of dynorphin A (Dyn A) and demonstrate whether the mechanism involved gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Previously, it was shown that midazolam given i.c.v. antagonizes morphine-induced antinociception by release of Dyn A in the spinal cord. This antagonism by midazolam is reversed by a variety of benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor complex antagonists given i.c.v. The results indicated that the antagonistic action of pentobarbital given i.c.v. was not due to release of Dyn A based on presumptive tests for Dyn A release. 1) In the tail-flick test, the opioid receptor antagonists, naloxone and nor-binaltorphimine intrathecally, did not reverse the antagonism. 2) Pretreatment with dynorphin antiserum and morphine had no effect. The effect of pentobarbital was inhibited by a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, given i.c.v. but not by a GABA antagonist, bicuculline s.c. or a chloride ion channel antagonist, picrotoxin, i.c.v. In contrast, the duration of loss of the righting reflex from systematically administered pentobarbital was shortened by bicuculline and picrotoxin but not by flumazenil. These results taken together with the previous results on midazolam suggested that the antagonistic action of pentobarbital on morphine-induced antinociception appeared to involve different GABA receptors from those involved in release of Dyn A by midazolam and those involved in the pentobarbital-induced loss of the righting reflex.", 
    "19": "The behavioral effects of the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2R,4R,5S-2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoate (NPC 17742) were compared with those of its parent compound, 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoate (NPC 12626), and other reference agents in a variety of operant-based tasks in rodents. In mice trained to lever press under a fixed-ratio (FR) 20 reinforcement schedule, NPC 17742 was 6.2 times more potent than NPC 12626 and equipotent with the competitive NMDA antagonist [E]-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-penteneoic acid (CGP 37849) in reducing rates of responding. NPC 17742 was also 3.5 and 4.5 times more potent than [+-]cis-4-phosphonomethyl-2-piperidine carboxylate (CGS 19755) and [+-] 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP), respectively, and half as potent as 3SR, 4aRS, 6SR, 8aRS-6-(phosphonomethyl)-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a- decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylate (LY 274614) in this paradigm. In rats trained to discriminate 4.0 mg/kg NPC 17742 from saline, NPC 17742 was 5.7 times more potent than NPC 12626 in substituting for NPC 17742. CGS 19755 also substituted for NPC 17742, but a maximum of only 50% NPC 17742 lever responding was observed after LY 274614 administration. In rats trained to lever press in a modified Geller-Seifter procedure, NPC 17742 and NPC 12626, like the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide, increased rates of punished responding. Neither tolerance nor sensitization to the anti-punishment effects were observed upon administration of NPC 17742 for 5 consecutive days. The results are consistent with NPC 17742 being a potent, systemically active compound whose behavioral effects are mediated through interaction with the NMDA receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The Morris water-maze has been designed to test spatial orientation ability, learning and memory processes. In order to improve the analyse of the organization of the trajectory of rats, during the training phase, a computer program was elaborated. The study of the effect of a benzodiazepine, diazepam, was chosen to illustrate and validate this methodological approach. Results showed that rats pre-treated with diazepam (2 mg/kg) presented an impairment of spatial learning associated with the occurrence of a stereotyped circular swimming behaviour.", 
    "21": "Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCS) is rarely encountered and may appear with a psychiatric mask. As clouding of consciousness is the major ictal manifestation, the condition may easily be overlooked in the mentally retarded. We have studied 11 mentally retarded patients with NCS. Since NCS with a focal onset may have a generalized ictal EEG pattern, a classification of NCS solely based on the seizure classification may be misleading. In some patients, it is impossible, both clinically and on the basis of EEG recordings, to distinguish between continuous complex partial seizures and atypical absences. We therefore propose a revised classification of NCS based on the ictal EEG pattern and the epilepsy syndrome diagnosis (I) NCS in generalized epilepsy syndromes, (II) NCS in localization-related epilepsy, (a) with localized EEG features, (b) with generalized EEG features, and (c) with transitional EEG features, and (III) undetermined NCS. Four of our patients were classified as Group I, two as Group IIa, one as Group IIb, one as Group IIc, and three as Group III. Benzodiazepines at small or standard doses may be ineffective in terminating NCS, particularly in the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The identification of trigger factors is essential. Drugs seemed to be the most important precipitants in our patients; in three, NCS was induced by recurrent rectal diazepam over-administration. This complication of rectal diazepam treatment in epilepsy has not been addressed previously.", 
    "22": "We have investigated the role of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors on synaptic transmission in vivo between Ia primary afferents and cat spinal motoneurones using a selective non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptor antagonist, GYKI 52466. Both microionophoretic and intravenous application of GYKI 52466 depressed the excitatory post-synaptic potential (Ia EPSP) in a dose-dependent manner, without any apparent effect on membrane conductance or resting potential of the motoneurone. GYKI 52466 reduced selectively alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)- but not N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced depolarizations. Our results suggest that a large part of the Ia EPSP is mediated by AMPA receptors. The participation of other excitatory amino-acid receptors in the Ia EPSP is also discussed.", 
    "23": "1. Experiments using localized microinfusions of specific agonists and antagonists of neurotransmitter receptors have shown that the amygdala, hippocampus, medial septum and entorhinal cortex are involved in memory consolidation, storage and expression. The data are consistent with observations derived from lesion studies suggesting a role for these structures in memory processes, but permit many additional conclusions concerning the mechanisms involved and their timing. 2. Memories are initially processed by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in amygdala, hippocampus and medial septum, which are sensitive to amino-phosphono valerate (AP5). Memory of inhibitory avoidance is processed by the three structures; memory of habituation to a novel environment is processed only by the hippocampus. At the time of consolidation, immediately after training, gamma-aminobutyrate type A (GABA-A) receptors, modulated by endogenous benzodiazepines, play an inhibitory role, and cholinergic muscarinic and beta-noradrenergic transmission play a modulatory role. 3. From 90 to 180 min after training, memories are blocked by cyano-nitro-quinoxalinedione (CNQX) given into the amygdala, septum and hippocampus. CNQX blocks non-NMDA glutamatergic receptors. Also between 90 and 180 min after training, memory of the habituation and inhibitory avoidance tasks is blocked by the infusion of AP5 or of the GABA-A agonist, muscimol, into the entorhinal cortex. This late post-training intervention of the entorhinal cortex is essential for the integration of successively acquired memories, and occurs in response to the simultaneous activation of CNQX-sensitive synapses in amygdala and hippocampus. 4. The expression of memory is blocked by the infusion of CNQX, at the time of testing, into the amygdala and hippocampus (inhibitory avoidance), into the hippocampus but not the amygdala (habituation), or into the entorhinal cortex (for the two tasks). Since consolidation is blocked by AP5 infused into these structures (see above), the data agree with the hypothesis that memories are mediated by (or actually consist of) long-term potentiation (LTP) in these areas of the brain. LTP induction is blocked by AP5 and LTP expression is blocked by CNQX. It is possible that, at the time of memory expression, the entorhinal cortex is an output of the amygdala and hippocampus.", 
    "24": "The general aim of the present series of experiments was to contrast the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) partial agonist bretazenil and those of the partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 in two-choice tests between saline (0.9% or 1.8%) and water, using water-deprived rats. Since BZR agonists appear to enhance positive hedonic reactions to taste stimuli selectively, it was hypothesized that bretazenil (and a second BZR partial agonist Ro 17-1812) would selectively enhance intake of a preferred 0.9% salt solution, but not necessarily reduce the relative aversion to a more concentrated 1.8% salt solution, in these choice tests. The results were in general agreement with these hypotheses. Despite an earlier finding that Ro 15-4513 abolished sweet taste preference, there was no evidence here that it reduced the relative preference expressed for 0.9% NaCl solution. Moreover, Ro 15-4513 did not enhance the relative avoidance of the 1.8% NaCl solution. The BZR antagonist, flumazenil, had no effect on either salt preference or aversion. These results indicate that the type of taste stimulus (sweet or salt), the type of behavioural response (preference or aversion) and the type of BZR ligand (agonist, antagonist or inverse agonist) interact to determine the observed behavioural consequences in choice tests.", 
    "25": "The effects of chronic administration of naloxone, morphine and met-enkephalin on benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in rat brain were determined 2 and 50 days after treatments were accomplished. Two days after naloxone treatment (75 micrograms/h s.c. for 14 days), enhanced BDZ receptor binding was observed in cingulate, frontal, piriform, entorhinal and sensorimotor cortices; amygdala complex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and central gray. Two days after morphine treatment (20 mg/kg i.p. daily for 6 days), increased BDZ receptor binding was detected in cingulate, frontal, piriform, entorhinal and sensorimotor cortices; amygdala complex, hippocampus and substantia nigra. Two days after met-enkephalin treatment (10 micrograms/h i.c.v. for 6 days) enhanced BDZ receptor binding was shown only in sensorimotor cortex. No significant changes were observed 50 days after the treatments were completed. These data indicate an important interaction between GABAergic and opioid peptide systems.", 
    "26": "The synthesis of a series of 2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-one derivatives and their in vitro biological evaluation as ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor are described. The in vitro activities, as determined by an analysis of GABA shift ratios, and binding affinities of these compounds to BZR are compared in terms of the electronic, lipophilic, and steric effect changes of their substituents.", 
    "27": "Progesterone (P) stimulation to both the ventral medial hypothalamus (VMH) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is necessary to facilitate sexual receptivity in female hamsters, despite the sparse population of estrogen-induced P receptors found in the VTA. Instead, P may act at neuronal membranes in the VTA. These P effects may be mediated by actions on the gamma-aminobutyric acid A-(GABAA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex (GBR). Many progestin metabolites have a greater effect in vitro on benzodiazepine binding and Cl- flux than P. If P's actions are due to metabolism to a progestin more potent at the GBR, then applying one of those progestin metabolites directly to the VTA should facilitate receptivity, if coupled with P to the VMH. To test this hypothesis three P metabolites, in decreasing order of activity at cortical synaptosome GBR, were tested: 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP), 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one (5 alpha-THDOC) and 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one (5 beta-THDOC). Ovariectomized hamsters were implanted with chronic cannulae, one aimed above the VMH and the other over the contralateral VTA. Animals were estrogen-primed and tested for sexual receptivity 4 h after a P containing insert was applied to the VMH and a metabolite containing insert was applied to the VTA. The following week the contents of the tubes were reversed; on the third week P was applied to both sites. Facilitation of receptivity occurred only when P was applied to the VMH and either P or a metabolite was applied to the VTA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The effect of male rat sexual behavior on the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam (FNP) in frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus was measured. The groups included were: (A) control (no sexual experience) handled males; (B) male rats sacrificed 24 h after their fifth mating experience; (C) males sacrificed 48 h after their fifth mating experience; (D) male rats sacrificed after 5 intromissions during the sixth mating experience; and (E) males sacrificed immediately after the ejaculation during the sixth mating experience. Relative to handled controls, significant decreases in maximal [3H]-FNP binding (Bmax) were observed in frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals sacrificed after 5 intromissions and in frontal cortex of rats sacrificed 24 h after the last mating experience. Relative to males sacrificed after 5 intromissions, males sacrificed immediately after ejaculation exhibited a rapid increase in Bmax in frontal cortex and hippocampus. No between-group differences in Kd for [3H]-FNP were noted, and sexual experience had no effect on the Bmax of [3H]-FNP in the hypothalamus.", 
    "29": "The effects of desipramine and diazepam on the behavior of rats in the forced swimming test were studied. Desipramine significantly enhanced struggling behavior, the intensity of its effect being greater in rats previously exposed to the forced swimming test for 1 or 4 days before drug administration. The effect of desipramine on immobility was significantly only in rats previously exposed to the test. Acute diazepam administration did not modify the behavior of rats in the test. Chronic administration (6 days) of two different doses of diazepam did not alter the behavior of rats in the forced swimming test, but significantly decreased the defecation rate, suggesting that the drug was effective as an anxiolytic. The present results suggest that the behavior of rats in the forced swimming test might be related to mood states rather than to fear/anxiety and that efficacy of the test to detect antidepressant activity might be enhanced by repeated exposure of the rats to the situation.",

Microdensitometry of autoradiograms show that while both benzodiazepine subtypes are found in visual area 17 early in life, the type II benzodiazepine receptors predominate. In adult human visual cortex comparable mounts of type I and type II subtypes occur in a laminar specific distribution concentrated in layers 4c and 2/3. The results may suggest a role for age-dependent expression of benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in visual cortex development and neuroplasticity.",

    "37": "We have recently demonstrated the presence of specific high-affinity cholecystokinin binding sites of the central type on the Human JURKAT T Lymphocyte Cell line. In this paper, changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in response to CCK (cholecystokinin) peptides were measured in the Human JURKAT T Lymphocyte Cell line by fura-2 fluorometry. CCK-8 (the C-terminal octapeptide of CCK), the potent CCK analog Boc-[Nle28,31]CCK-7, stimulated ([Ca2+]i) mobilization in a dose-dependent manner in cells preloaded with fura-2 AM with an EC50 of 2.4 +/- 1 nM and 8 +/- 2 nM, respectively. The selective CCKB receptor agonists, namely Boc-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2 and the cyclic analog JMV320, [formula: see text], were also potent in stimulating mobilization of [Ca2+]i with an EC50 of 32 +/- 10 nM and 25 +/- 10 nM, respectively. Compound JMV180, Boc-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-Trp-Nle-Asp-2-phenylethyl ester, did not stimulate [Ca2+]i but inhibited the mobilization of [Ca2+]i elicited by 10 nM CCK-8 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 10 +/- 2 nM. The selective non-peptide CCKB receptor antagonist L-365,260 was more potent than the selective CCKA receptor antagonist MK-329 in inhibiting the [Ca2+]i mobilization elicited by 10 nM CCK-8 with IC50 values of 20 +/- 8 nM and 400 +/- 100 nM, respectively. These data indicated that CCK-8 and potent CCK analogs induced [Ca2+]i mobilization in the Human JURKAT T cell line through the CCKB/gastrin receptor type.", 
    "38": "Several nonnucleoside inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been described, including Nevirapine, thiobenzimidazolone (TIBO) derivatives, pyridinone derivatives such as L-697,661, and the bis(heteroaryl)piperazines (BHAPs). HIV-1 resistant to L-697,661 or Nevirapine emerges rapidly in infected patients treated with these drugs, and the resistance is caused primarily by substitutions at amino acids 181 and 103 of RT that also confer cross resistance to the other nonnucleoside inhibitors. We describe derivation and characterization of two BHAP-resistant HIV-1 variants that differ from this pattern of cross resistance. With both variants, HIV-1 resistance to BHAP RT inhibitors was caused by a RT mutation that results in a proline-to-leucine substitution at amino acid 236 (P236L). Rather than conferring cross resistance to other RT inhibitors, this substitution sensitized RT 7- to 10-fold to Nevirapine, TIBO R82913, and L-697,661 without influencing sensitivity to nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors. This sensitization caused by P236L was also observed in cell culture with BHAP-resistant HIV-1. The effects of the P236L RT substitution suggest that emergence of BHAP-resistant virus in vivo could produce a viral population sensitized to inhibition by these other nonnucleoside RT inhibitors.", 
    "39": "An experimental model for inducing tolerance to and dependence upon pentobarbital was characterized. Rats were infused with pentobarbital, 300 micrograms/10 microliter per h i.c.v. for 6 or 7 days, through pre-implanted cannulas by osmotic minipumps. Measurement of brain and serum levels showed that pentobarbital remained mainly inside of the brain. Measurements of sleeping time and susceptibility to convulsant-induced seizures indicated a substantial degree of tolerance and dependence (24 h after termination of infusion). Results of GABAA receptor binding assays showed marked regional variations. While [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding sites were increased in frontal cortices and striata of pentobarbital-dependent animals, KD was increased in striata of tolerant animals. Dependence upon pentobarbital was correlated with increased [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in all three regions examined. Both high and low affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites were increased in dependent animals, but low affinity sites were decreased in frontal cortices of tolerant animals. KDs of [3H]muscimol high affinity sites were increased in cerebellum after animals developed dependence upon pentobarbital. KDs of [3H]muscimol low affinity sites were decreased in striata of pentobarbital tolerant animals. These findings further support the hypothesis that GABAA receptors in discrete areas of the brain have different subunit compositions and are regulated differentially by pharmacological modulators.", 
    "40": "The benzodiazepine receptor agonists, flurazepam, zolpidem, ZK 93423, and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, FG 7142, all produced hypothermia when injected i.p. in mice. These compounds are structurally different and do not have the same affinity for the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. Pretreatment with flumazenil (30 mg/kg) completely blocked the hypothermia produced by flurazepam (30 mg/kg), zolpidem (3 mg/kg), and FG 7142 (60 mg/kg), only partially reversed ZK 93423 (3 mg/kg), and was ineffective against 10 mg/kg zolpidem. In comparison, 3 mg/kg of U-78875 completely antagonized all these benzodiazepine agonists. When injected before 30 mg/kg pentobarbital, U-78875 (3 mg/kg) slightly enhanced and prolonged the hypothermic effect of pentobarbital, while flumazenil had very little effect. The results show that U-78875 is a potent antagonist against benzodiazepine receptor agonists, while having demonstrable intrinsic activity.", 
    "41": "The specific binding sites of a homophthalazine, girisopam, in rat brain have been localized by qualitative and quantitative autoradiography.

    "42": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 mRNA have been found in the pancreas. We investigated the ability of ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 to interact with and alter dispersed rat pancreatic acinar cell function. Radiolabeled ETs bound in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion, which was specific and saturable. Analysis demonstrated two classes of receptors, one class (ETA receptor) had a high affinity for ET-1 but a low affinity for ET-3, and the other class (ETB receptor) had equally high affinities for ET-1 and ET-3. No specific receptor for ET-2 was identified. Pancreatic secretagogues that activate phospholipase C (PLC) inhibited binding of 125I-labeled ET-1 (125I-ET-1) or 125I-ET-3, whereas agents that act through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) did not. A23187 had no effect on 125I-ET-1 or 125I-ET-3 binding, whereas the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate reduced binding. The effect of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) was mediated through its own receptor. Stripping of surface bound ligand studies demonstrated that both 125I-labeled ET-1 and 125I-labeled ET-3 were rapidly internalized. CCK-8 decreased the internalization but did not change the amount of surface bound ligand. Endothelins neither stimulate nor alter changes in enzyme secretion, intracellular calcium, cAMP, or [3H]inositol trisphosphate (IP3). This study demonstrates the presence of ETA and ETB receptors on rat pancreatic acini; occupation of both receptors resulted in rapid internalization, which is regulated by PLC-activating secretagogues. Occupation of either ET receptor did not alter intracellular calcium, cAMP, IP3, or stimulate amylase release.", 
    "43": "The DS (diazepam-sensitive) and DR (diazepam-resistant) lines of mice, selected on the basis of their ataxic response to diazepam, also diverge in the physiologic response of their brain gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors to benzodiazepines, as indicated by augmentation of GABA-mediated chloride flux. Cross-sensitivity and -resistance to other sedatives known to interact with the GABAA-receptor have also been demonstrated in DS and DR mice. Based on the finding that these mice also show cross-sensitivity and -resistance to obtundation by halothane, we predicted that their GABAA-receptors would also exhibit a differential response to halothane as assayed by an in vitro 36Cl- influx assay using purified brain microvesicles. Consistent with this prediction, therapeutic concentrations of halothane enhanced 1 mumol/l GABA-gated flux with significantly greater potency in DS than in DR mice (halothane EC50 336 +/- 64 mumol/l (S.E.M.) vs. 605 +/- 110 mumol/l, respectively, P = 0.03), but there was no difference in maximal flux enhancement between the two lines (DS 4.7 +/- 0.4 nmol.mg-1 x 3 s-1, vs. DR 4.7 +/- 0.5 nmol.mg-1 x 3 s-1). Halothane (500 mumol/l) also shifted the entire GABA concentration-flux relationship significantly to the left, decreasing the EC50 for GABA in both the DS and DR lines. Importantly, the shift in the GABA concentration-flux response in the presence of halothane was more pronounced in the DS mice (GABA EC50 1.8 +/- 0.4 mumol/l vs. 14.7 +/- 0.9 mumol/l without halothane) than in the DR mice (GABA EC50 4.7 +/- 0.6 mumol/l vs. 14.7 +/- 0.9 mumol/l without halothane).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Methods to disturb equilibrium range from standing on foam surface, attaching vibrators to the calves to interfere with somatosensation, and exposure to body-position tracking environments, as in dynamic posturography (EquiTest). The EquiTest apparatus was modified by a menu-driven software to allow arbitrary movements of the support surface and visual surround, and force data were recorded for subsequent analysis. The support surface was randomly moved in the antero-posterior direction. First equilibrium was studied on the stable support surface, then low (RMS 1.3 cm) and high (RMS 2.6 cm) amplitude movements were used. Vision was either present or absent at all test amplitudes. Equilibrium was evaluated by the confidence (61%) ellipse sway area and average sway velocity during 45 s. Eleven healthy subjects aged 23-36 years (mean 29) were sedated with a short acting sedative, midazolam 0.1 mg/kg. Randomized perturbed posturography was conducted at baseline, and at about 60, 120 and 180 min after injection. Psychomotor tests were conducted at baseline, and at 30, 90, 150 and 210 min. Large interindividual variations were found. One subject could not be tested at all at 60 min due to sleepiness, whereas some subjects felt nearly full awake at 30 min. Sway areas were larger at 60 min, but not subsequently. At 60 min, sway velocities with open eyes were higher, just as when vision was absent and low amplitude movements were used.

    "51": "Progesterone is metabolized by ring-A reduction with subsequent oxidoreduction to 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone (3 alpha-OH-5 alpha-DHP), a naturally occurring metabolite that has been shown to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) binding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a commonly prescribed progestational agent, is a synthetic progesterone derivative that has a metabolic profile similar to that of progesterone. In this study, the effects of MPA and its ring-A reduced metabolites DHMPA and THMPA on [3H]FNZ binding were investigated. While known modulators of specific [3H]FNZ binding demonstrated expected effects in frozen and fresh rat cortical tissue, 3 alpha-OH-5 alpha-DHP enhanced [3H]FNZ binding only in fresh, not frozen, tissue. Neither DHMPA nor THMPA affected binding, while MPA partially inhibited [3H]FNZ binding by 40%. In addition, five test drugs were used to assess the effect of gender and hormonal status on [3H]FNZ binding. Neither gender nor hormonal status influenced binding. Thus, ring-A reduced metabolites of progesterone but not of MPA enhance [3H]FNZ binding. The clinical implications of these in vitro results are currently under investigation.", 
    "52": "The effects of acute pentobarbital treatment were assessed using a complex operant test battery containing five tasks in which correct performance is thought to depend upon processes associated with short-term memory and attention [delayed-matching-to-sample (DMTS)], color and position discrimination [conditioned position responding (CPR)], motivation [progressive ratio (PR)], time perception [temporal response differentiation (TRD)], and learning [incremental repeated acquisition (IRA)]. Adult, male rhesus monkeys were tested 15 min after IV injection of saline or pentobarbital (1, 3, 5.6, 10, or 15 mg/kg). Behavioral endpoints measured included percent task completed, response rate or latency, and response accuracy. The order of task sensitivity to disruption by PBT was TRD > IRA = DMTS = PR > CPR, in which sensitivity was defined as a significant disruption in any aspect of task performance. PBT slowed response rates at 10.0 and/or 15.0 mg/kg in all tasks. Accuracy was decreased in the TRD task at > or = 5.6 mg/kg but doses of > or = 10.0 mg/kg were required to decrease accuracy in the IRA, DMTS, and CPR tasks. Thus, behavior thought to model time perception (TRD) was more sensitive than behavior modeling learning (IRA), short-term memory and attention (DMTS), and motivation (PR). CPR was the least sensitive behavior. Because pentobarbital exerts its effects at least in part via GABA systems, the effects in the current study were compared with those of a previous study of the acute effects of diazepam. The two compounds exerted fundamentally different effects on operant test battery performance.",

We prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Overall, venous complications were more frequent with diazepam (22 of 62 patients) than with midazolam (4 of 60 patients) (p < 0.001). A palpable venous cord was present in 23% (14 of 62) of patients in the diazepam group, compared with 2% (1 of 60 patients) in the midazolam group (p < 0.002). Pain at the injection site occurred in 35% (22 of 62) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7% (4 of 60 patients) in the midazolam group (p < 0.001). Swelling and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups. Smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, intravenous catheter site, dwell time of the needle, alcohol use, and pain during the injection had no effect on the incidence of venous complications.", 
    "54": "To determine whether oxygen desaturation and cardiac arrhythmias occur in children during esophagogastroduodenoscopy with the use of conscious sedation, we prospectively studied 34 consecutive patients between the ages of 2 months and 18 years. Patients with pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic disorders were defined as high risk and those without were defined as normal. All patients received intravenous sedation with meperidine, diazepam, or midazolam, used alone or in combination. Pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, and lead II electrocardiogram were recorded throughout all episodes of desaturation and tachycardia. Oxygen desaturation to less than 90% occurred in 68% of normal patients and in 58% of high-risk patients during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Seventy-five percent of the high-risk patients and 82% of the normal patients had an arrhythmia during esophagogastroduodenoscopy usually associated with oxygen desaturation. Sinus tachycardia was the most common arrhythmia, although other arrhythmias were identified. Despite the frequency of oxygen desaturation and cardiac arrhythmias, no adverse outcome was observed in any patient. Most episodes of oxygen desaturation and cardiac arrhythmia resolved spontaneously. Subdivision of patients into high-risk groups by age, sex, weight, or diameter of endoscope used did not allow prediction of oxygen desaturation or cardiac arrhythmia. Our data suggest that conscious sedation in children undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy is safe and free of significant adverse clinical problems. However, conscious sedation during esophagogastroduodenoscopy continues to have certain inherent risks. Therefore we strongly advocate the routine use of continuous cardiac rhythm and pulse oximetry monitoring of all children during esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed with the use of conscious sedation.",

No statistically significant differences were observed between the vasovagal and control groups with regard to demographics, cardiopulmonary disease, cardiac medications, procedure success, the endoscopist, patient procedure tolerance, colon preparation, or procedure difficulty. A significant difference was seen in the mean dose of midazolam used in the vasovagal group as compared with that used in the control group (4.6 mg versus 3.9 mg, p < 0.04), and moderate to severe diverticulosis was more commonly seen in the vasovagal group as compared with the control group (43% versus 16%, p < 0.02).

All patients were sedated with diazepam after administration of the spray. Included in the study were 158 consecutive patients aged 18 years or older being treated at the endoscopy unit of Scunthorpe district general hospital. Tolerance to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as assessed by endoscopists and patients was evaluated. Of the 158 patients, 85 received the placebo spray and 73 the lidocaine spray. Patient acceptability for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was significantly greater in the lidocaine group than in the placebo group (p = 0.001), and tolerance to the procedure as assessed by the endoscopist was also significantly greater in the lidocaine group than in the placebo group (p = 0.008).

We studied 50 patients, scheduled for daycase laparoscopy, randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group P patients received 30 min before induction of anaesthesia, in a double-blind manner an infusion of 250 ml dextrose 5% while patients in Group E (n = 25) received 500 mg of erythromycin diluted in 250 ml dextrose 5%. An orogastric tube was inserted to measure both gastric pH using a pHmeter and residual gastric volume (RGV) using the phenol red dilutional technique. Six patients were excluded for surgical reasons. More patients in Group P (6/22) than in Group E (0/22) had RGV > 25 ml and more patients in Group P (17/22) presented with a gastric pH < 2.5 than in Group E (5/22), P < 0.05. Since coma and respiratory depression have been reported recently after midazolam and alfentanil administration in patients having received erythromycin, recovery conditions were assessed and were found to be comparable between groups. In conclusion, the administration of iv erythromycin before outpatient laparoscopy decreased residual gastric volume and increased gastric pH without affecting recovery from general anaesthesia.", 
    "58": "Outcome of anxiety disorder treatment with psychotherapy and medication is generally as good as or better than that of other psychiatric illnesses. Nevertheless, refractory cases occur. The first step in approaching the treatment-resistant patient with an anxiety disorder is to be certain that the treatment has been adequate. Failure to provide an adequate dose of medication for adequate periods of time may be the most common cause of \"treatment resistance.\" The second step is to reconsider the diagnosis and/or determine if new diagnoses have emerged since the original consultation. Depression and substance abuse are especially likely to complicate anxiety disorders. Several studies have shown that concomitant personality disorders (axis II) increase the occurrence of resistance to standard treatment and must be addressed through psychotherapy. Last, a variety of possible underlying medical conditions, including thyroid disorder, arrhythmia, and complex partial seizure, should be considered. Then, the clinician should consider a variety of pharmacologic approaches that are specific to each anxiety disorder. Panic disorder patients who are refractory to imipramine frequently respond to high-potency benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or various combinations. Generalized anxiety disorder, if unresponsive to benzodiazepines, may respond to buspirone or a tricyclic antidepressant. Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder who have failed to respond to clomipramine or fluoxetine and other serotonin reuptake blockers may benefit from augmentation strategies using combination therapies including buspirone, fenfluramine, and neuroleptics. Social phobia refractory to beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors may benefit from buspirone, fenfluramine, and neuroleptics.

However, many general psychiatrists have had minimal training in treating patients with addictions, and many experts on alcoholism have not fully mastered the armamentarium of approaches to treating anxiety. In general, special problems exist in treating anxiety in patients with alcoholism, particularly in those patients with anxiety disorders. The clinician must analyze and treat the complicated interaction between these disorders and target the right combination and sequences of treatment fitting the specific needs of the case. The effects of intoxication, withdrawal, and chronic use on anxiety and need to be taken into account and the primary vs. secondary nature of the disorders needs to be determined. Parameters for choosing setting, modality, pharmacologic approaches, and issues in treating special populations will be discussed. Decisions about treatment should be based on sound knowledge of the epidemiology, diagnostic issues, genetics, pathophysiology, biological aspects, clinical course, complications, and treatment-outcome studies of anxiety and alcohol disorders. The wise clinician also needs to show flexibility in approaching treatment-resistant cases.",

It was found that nifedipine alone had no significant effects on sleep and prevented sleep induction by triazolam. There were no drug-specific effects on core temperature in any treatment condition.

    "65": "Northern blot analysis of nerve growth factor (NGF) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), together with a two-site enzyme immunoassay for NGF protein, showed that a convulsive dose of bicuculline (0.4 mg/kg, IV) induced a rapid (within 1 hour) three-fold increase in hippocampal NGF mRNA. This increase was followed by a significant increase in NGF protein 5 hours later. No changes were detected in the cerebral cortex. The increase of rat hippocampal NGF mRNA and protein content was associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone content. Both responses were completely prevented by a pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg, IP), which suggested that adrenal steroids might be a stimulus underlying the rapid increase in NGF biosynthesis following bicuculline convulsions. Therefore, we tested to determine whether a convulsive dose of bicuculline could increase NGF mRNA in adrenalectomized and sham-operated rats. Bicuculline increases hippocampal NGF mRNA in sham-operated rats, but not in adrenalectomized rats despite the presence of convulsions in both experimental groups. Moreover, in adrenalectomized rats, dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg, SC) could partly restore the increase in hippocampal NGF mRNA content induced by bicuculline convulsions; thus, adrenal steroids might have an essential role in the induction of hippocampal NGF biosynthesis elicited by bicuculline convulsions.", 
    "66": "Table 4 provides a summary of the evidence that specific medications adversely affect the safety of the older driver. The preponderance of evidence suggests that benzodiazepines adversely affect the safety of the older driver, particularly for high doses and long half-life compounds. This conclusion is based upon the very consistent psychomotor function data showing pronounced dose-related impairment, the more limited epidemiologic data on crash involvement, epidemiologic data associating benzodiazepines with other types of injuries, and the fact that the reasons for most benzodiazepine use are not plausible confounders. This conclusion thus reinforces the need to prescribe benzodiazepines cautiously, including assessment of nonpharmacologic alternatives, use of the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time, and avoidance of the very long half-life compounds. As more new nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics become available, their effects on the safety of the elderly driver need to be determined. There is some evidence that cyclic antidepressants, currently the mainstay for treatment of depression in the elderly population, adversely affect driving safety; however, because of the paucity of experimental and epidemiologic data concerning the effects of depression per se on driving, further research is needed. Nevertheless, the existing data reinforce the need for careful prescribing of antidepressants, particularly avoidance of agents with high side-effect profiles (such as amitriptyline and imipramine) in the older driver. For hypoglycemics, although there is sufficient evidence of driving impairment to create a basis for concern, there are many unresolved questions. Currently, diabetic patients should be advised concerning the risk and management of hypoglycemia. For other sedating drugs, it always is prudent to advise patients concerning potential effects on driving. Unlike younger drivers, the typical older driver is a medication-taker. There now is a substantial body of evidence that commonly used medications can interfere with driving safety. Because many questions remain unanswered, there is a pressing need for further research that more fully elucidates how patient characteristics, disease, and drugs interact to affect driving safety; however, sufficient data are available to reinforce an underlying theme in geriatric medicine that is not yet fully implemented in practice: the need for caution in pharmacotherapy, with selection of a drug, dose, and regimen suitable for the unique characteristics of this population.", 
    "67": "White-crowned sparrows maintained on short days (9:15-h light-dark cycle) were peripherally injected with 1.0, 4.0, and 16 micrograms/kg ip of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8). Meal size over the subsequent 30 min was significantly depressed in a dose-dependent fashion. Water intake was not affected. The anorexic effect caused by 4.0 micrograms/kg was attenuated by 100 micrograms/kg of the type-A CCK receptor antagonist MK-329 but not by 300 micrograms/kg of the type-B CCK receptor antagonist L 365,260, suggesting that CCK-induced suppression of food intake in this species is mediated by a CCK-A receptor. Administration of both CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists alone resulted in no change in meal size. These experiments suggest that white-crowned sparrows, when weight stable, respond to CCK-8 in a manner comparable with several mammalian species.", 
    "68": "Opiate intoxication accounts for the majority of emergencies related to substance abuse. The concomitant intravenous and intramuscular administration of the specific narcotic antagonist naloxone is warranted in such cases. Further threatening complications of opiate abuse include rhabdomyolysis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and both peripheral and central nervous lesions. Opiate abuse is often associated with benzodiazepine abuse. Hence, intravenous administration of the antagonist flumazenil is indicated in patients with suspected acute opiate intoxication resistant to naloxone. Cocaine abuse is not frequent in this country but is usually very severe and clinically heterogeneous. The clinical pattern of cocaine intoxication is initially due to excitatory and later to depressant effects on central nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems. The treatment of acute cocaine intoxication is symptomatic. The internal concealment of cocaine and other drugs in packets (body-packing) may lead to bowel obstruction or to acute intoxication following leaking or breaking of packets.", 
    "69": "The effects of sigma ligands on the central acetylcholine (ACh) systems in the rat frontal cortex were examined. By using brain microdialysis techniques, we showed that nonbenzomorphan sigma ligands, (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine (DTG) dose-dependently increased the extracellular ACh level in this area. Similarly, benzomorphan sigma ligands, (+/-)-pentazocine and (+)-N-allylnormetazocine [(+)-SKF-10,047] also increased the extracellular ACh level. The increase in extracellular ACh level elicited by (+)-SKF-10,047 was greater than that by (-)-SKF-10,047. Moreover, the (+)-SKF-10,047- and DTG-induced increase in the extracellular ACh level were reduced significantly by simultaneous administration of haloperidol, a putative sigma receptor antagonist, whereas the (+)-SKF-10,047-induced increase was unaffected by (+/-)-3-(2- carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid, a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel antagonist. On the other hand, none of the sigma ligands tested in this study had any effects on acetylcholinesterase or choline acetyltransferase activity and sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake site in the rat frontal cortex. Ranking of potency for increasing extracellular ACh level was in the following order: (+/-)-pentazocine > (+)-SKF-10,047 > (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine > DTG. This order was positively correlated with the order of binding potency for the (+)-[3H]SKF-10,047 binding site in the rat frontal cortex, but was not correlated with binding to the [3H]DTG, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate and [3H]AF-DX116 ([3H]11-[(2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "1. The effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists considered to be selective for M1 receptors (pirenzepine; PZ), M2 receptors (AFDX-116), and for M3 receptors (4-diphenyl acetoxy N-methyl-piperidine (4-DAMP)) were used to investigate the existence of muscarinic receptors subtypes in murine airways. Atropine was used as a nonselective antagonist. The effects of these antagonists were studied upon tracheal contractions induced either by EFS (electric field stimulation) or by application of an exogenous cholinoceptor agonist (arecoline). 2. The muscarinic receptor antagonists tested inhibited arecoline-induced tracheal contractions with the following rank order of potency: 4-DAMP = atropine > pirenzepine = AFDX-116. The rank order of potency of the muscarinic antagonists used in inhibiting EFS-induced tracheal contractions was: 4-DAMP = atropine > PZ > AFDX-116. The pA2 values for these antagonists were similar when compared to the pA2 values determined in guinea-pig and bovine airway smooth muscle. 3. In addition to in vitro studies, the effects of inhalation of the different muscarinic antagonists on lung function parameters in vivo were investigated. Inhalation of 4-DAMP induced a decrease in airway resistance and an increase in lung compliance. In contrast, inhalation of AFDX-116 induced an increase in airway resistance and almost no change in lung compliance. Apart from some minor effects of atropine on airway resistance, atropine, PZ, and pilocarpine failed to induce changes in lung mechanics as determined by in vivo lung function measurements. 4. The results provide evidence for the existence of M3 receptors on murine tracheae that are involved in the contraction of tracheal smooth muscle. This is in agreement with other animal species such as the guinea-pig and bovine. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that in the mouse, M3 receptors play an important role in bronchial smooth muscle contraction and thus in bronchoconstriction. Interestingly we have also demonstrated that M2 receptors can play a role in bronchodilatation. Inhalation of an M2 receptor antagonist induced an increase in airway resistance whereas inhalation of an M3 receptor antagonist induced a decrease in airway resistance. It is therefore likely that an M3/M2 receptor balance plays an important role in the regulation of airway function.",

The content of amino acids (taurine, glycine, glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and aspartic acid) and monoamines (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and noradrenaline) in homogenates of rat cortical and hippocampal tissue were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) with fluorescent and electrochemical detection respectively, after two anxiogenic treatments: exposure to a phobic stimulus (cat odour) and withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment. 2. In neither of the two anxiogenic situations was there a significant change in any amino acid content, in either brain area. 3. In the group withdrawn from chronic diazepam, cortical 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels and hippocampal 5-HT levels were significantly increased. Noradrenaline content was significantly decreased in the hippocampus. 4. The changes in 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels following cat odour exposure were area-specific in that they decreased in the hippocampus, but increased in the cortex. 5. Following cat odour exposure, noradrenaline levels appeared not to change in either area studied. However during exposure to cat odour, it was found that half the animals avoided the odour source and half were indifferent. The animals showing marked avoidance had significantly higher cortical noradrenaline content and this was significantly different from control, whereas hippocampal noradrenaline levels were not dependent upon the differences in avoidance of the odour source. 6. The results show clearly different neurochemical changes in the rat following exposure to a phobic stimulus and withdrawal from diazepam. It is hoped comparative studies such as this will enable better understanding of anxiety states in the rat which could parallel the different classes of anxiety recognised in the clinic", 
    "72": "The feasibility of incorporating blood sampling for population pharmacokinetic analysis into postmarketing surveillance was evaluated. Demographic and drug disposition data, consisting of two blood samples collected at a random time during two different dose intervals, was prospectively collected for 94 psychiatric inpatients (mean age, 48 +/- 13 years) receiving alprazolam. Mixed-effect modeling was used to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean alprazolam clearance, volume of distribution, and absorption rate constant were 0.05 L/hr/kg, 0.7 L/kg, and 1.1 hr-1, respectively. Clearance was increased by 59% in women, decreased by 26% in patients with multiple organ disease, and decreased by 23% in patients older than 60 years of age. These estimates are similar to those determined from rigorous premarketing clinical trials. Interindividual variability in alprazolam clearance was relatively small (40%) after adjustment for significant patient covariates. Population pharmacokinetic analysis represents a reasonable approach to assessment of pharmacokinetic variability in a large, heterogenous patient population.",

Patients who do not respond to this treatment are generally treated with phenobarbital or general anesthetics both of which may require intubation to maintain respiration. Our experience of four cases with status epilepticus treated with intravenous lidocaine who had failed to respond to diazepam and phenytoin therapy is presented. Two cases responded to a single dose of lidocaine, one required a second dose of lidocaine to control seizures, and the fourth patient failed to respond and died as a result of associated severe head injury. Therefore, there is a need to conduct further studies to establish the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine in the treatment of refractory status epilepticus.",

They were randomized to receive 0.2 mg/kg of midazolam in the nose or under the tongue without or with additional flavoring. For the group receiving sublingual flavored midazolam, the syringe tip was dipped in candy flavor and sugar. Duration of crying and compliance with instructions for sublingual drug administration were recorded.

Lack of total compliance with instructions for sublingual administration did not alter drug effect, and there were no differences between the three study groups in maximum sedation, response to separation from parents, and behavior at induction of anesthesia; 80% displayed adequate or excellent behavior.

These patients were randomized to receive an initial bolus of either phenylephrine (1 micrograms/kg) or norepinephrine (0.05 micrograms/kg) followed by a bolus of the other drug after arterial pressure and heart rate (HR) had returned to baseline. Transesophageal echocardiography was used to evaluate LVF. Arterial pressure, HR, ejection time, and LV diameter, area, and wall thickness were recorded immediately before and for 3 min after bolus administration. Fractional diameter shortening, fractional area change, mean heart rate corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (mVcfc), and LV meridional end-systolic wall stress (ESWS) were calculated.",

    "82": "Ondansetron hydrochloride is a new serotonin receptor antagonist that is effective in preventing emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy. The antiemetic effect appears to be exerted through a peripheral vagal blocking within the gastrointestinal tract, as well as an inhibitory effect within the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). Plasma concentrations of ondansetron peak 1 hour after an oral dose, and the tablet has an absolute bioavailability of 59%. Ondansetron undergoes extensive hepatic oxidative metabolism in the liver. The half-life of ondansetron is 3.5 hours in healthy volunteers; elderly patients have a slightly reduced clearance, and pediatric patients have increased clearance. Although less than 10% of ondansetron is recovered unchanged in the urine, most metabolites are eliminated by this route. The recommended dose of ondansetron is 0.15 mg/kg for three doses on the day of chemotherapy (30 minutes before chemotherapy and 4 and 8 hours afterward). An alternative regimen includes a single-day dose of 32 mg IV in adult patients before chemotherapy. The efficacy of ondansetron therapy for delayed emesis has not been determined. Ondansetron has proven to be appropriate as a single agent or as an addition to standard antiemetic therapy (ie, corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, neurotransmitter blockers) in preventing and treating acute chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE). Initial results of clinical trials in prevention of radiotherapy-induced emesis and anesthesia-induced emesis appear positive. Ondansetron is well tolerated, with few adverse events (eg, headache, sedation).", 
    "83": "Plasma levels of fentanyl were analyzed in 12 infants undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation who received a fentanyl bolus (5 to 10 micrograms/kg) followed by infusion at 1 to 6.3 micrograms/kg/hr. Fentanyl levels, averaging 11 samples/infant, were measured by radioimmunoassay (mean 19.7 +/- 35.7 ng/ml; n = 140). Eight of the infants, all with a primary diagnosis other than congenital diaphragmatic hernia, survived with relatively short (< 7 days) courses on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; this group of infants did not develop tolerance to fentanyl and could be maintained on infusion rates of < 5 micrograms/kg/hr throughout. The four infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia had longer extracorporeal membrane oxygenation runs and three did not survive; their plasma fentanyl levels were consistently higher and while the infusion rates were higher early on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, they did not exceed 7 micrograms/kg/hr and actually decreased after 5 days on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Five infants (42%) received lorazepam in addition to fentanyl for at least one sampling time. The fentanyl infusion dose and plasma level were higher in the congenital diaphragmatic hernia nonsurvivors who did not receive lorazepam (p < 0.001). A decrease in fentanyl clearance correlated with renal dysfunction (p < 0.01). A bolus of fentanyl followed by infusion of relatively low doses (1 to 5 micrograms/kg/hr) provides adequate analgesia for infants on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, particularly when it is supplemented with intravenous lorazepam whenever needed to control infant movement.",

We present a patient with COPD and major depression who developed hypercapnic respiratory failure while receiving nortriptyline and oxazepam. Because of known respiratory depressant effects of the latter drug, nortriptyline alone was resumed upon recovery. Depression of CO2 sensitivity and ventilatory load compensation with a concomitant increase in exercise tolerance with decreased dyspnea was observed while she was receiving nortriptyline. These results demonstrate a previously unreported depressant effect of nortriptyline on ventilatory control, and they suggest the need for further investigation of the ventilatory effects of this drug in patients with pulmonary disease.", 
    "85": "The effects of sedative infusions of propofol on the processed electroencephalograms (EEG) of eight healthy male volunteers were studied. EEG data for aperiodic analysis were collected during three 5-min periods: before propofol, during propofol infusion, and 30 min after termination of the infusion. After an initial dose of 1 mg/kg, subjects received a propofol infusion titrated to produce a standard level of conscious sedation. The infusion rate was 84 +/- 27 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1 (mean +/- SE) and plasma propofol levels were 2180 +/- 43 ng/mL. Total EEG power, defined as the sum of the squares of peak-to-peak amplitudes during each 5-s epoch, increased from 1350 +/- 295 microV2 x epoch-1 to 9675 +/- 2390 microV2 x epoch-1 during the propofol infusion (P < 0.05); it returned to 1445 +/- 145 microV2 x epoch-1 30 min after the infusion was discontinued (P < 0.05 vs the result during propofol). The change in total power was accompanied by a change in the distribution of power within the EEG spectrum, as the fraction of activity in the beta-band (12-35 Hz) increased during the infusion from 23% +/- 3% to 44% +/- 5% (P < 0.05). Thirty minutes after the infusion was terminated, the distribution of activity within the EEG spectrum had reverted to pre-propofol patterns. The similarity of EEG effects seen with sedative doses of propofol and benzodiazepines suggests that these drugs may share some neurochemical effects.",

All patients received preanesthetic medication including morphine, a benzodiazepine, and/or scopolamine. Anesthesia was induced and maintained by one of two fentanyl infusion regimens: HIGH-FEN (n = 6), a priming infusion of 2.4 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1 for 20 min in combination with a continuous infusion of 0.3 microgram.kg-1.min-1 for the duration of the operation to produce a plasma fentanyl concentration of 20-25 ng/mL; or LOW-FEN (n = 11), priming and maintenance infusions of 2.4 and 0.15 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1 designed to produce a fentanyl concentration of 12-15 ng/mL of plasma. The six patients receiving HIGH-FEN had plasma fentanyl concentrations maintained between 20 and 27 ng/mL and none required anesthetic supplementation before CPB; one patient required a single dose of thiopental 50 mg after the termination of CPB. The total fentanyl dose for the operation (3.2 +/- 0.1 h) averaged 107 +/- 2 micrograms/kg (range 100.5-115.5 micrograms/kg). The 11 patients receiving LOW-FEN had a plasma fentanyl concentration maintained below 20 ng/mL (range 13-17 ng/mL). Eight patients before and 10 patients after CPB required anesthetic supplementation for adverse hemodynamic or somatic responses.

    "87": "This randomized, prospective clinical study investigated the effects of supplemental inspired oxygen on arterial hemoglobin desaturation and myocardial ischemia in premedicated patients who have critical coronary artery stenosis, identified predictors for these adverse events, and examined the temporal relationship between hemoglobin desaturation and myocardial ischemia. Before elective coronary artery bypass surgery, 104 patients were monitored continuously by using a real-time electrocardiogram (V4 and V5 leads) recorder and a digital pulse oximeter. After a 2-h baseline monitoring period (Interval A), patients were given sublingual lorazepam 0.03 mg/kg, and were randomized to receive continuous supplemental inspired oxygen by nasal catheters [4 L/min (Oxygen Group, n = 52)] or to receive no supplemental inspired oxygen (Control Group, n = 52) (Interval B). One hour later, all patients received intramuscular morphine 0.15 mg/kg with perphenazine 0.05 mg/kg (Interval C). Interval C lasted 1 h, and the study was terminated. In the Oxygen Group, the incidence of desaturation was 25% before premedication and 11.5% after premedication (NS). In the Control Group after premedication, the incidence of desaturation increased from 25% to 56.9% (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of myocardial ischemia before or after premedication within or between the two groups. Arterial hemoglobin desaturation was not associated temporally with myocardial ischemia at any time. Predictors of desaturation after premedication included absence of supplemental O2, increased weight, age, and occurrence of desaturation before premedication. There were no identifiable predictors for myocardial ischemia after premedication.

    "88": "We investigated whether midazolam administration influenced morphine-induced antinociception and tolerance and dependence in the rat. Antinociception was assessed by the tail-flick (TF) and the hot-plate test (HP 52 degrees C). Morphine tolerance developed after daily single injections of morphine for 11 days. The effect of midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception and tolerance was assessed by giving daily injections of various doses of midazolam for 11 days. The first injection of saline or midazolam was given intraperitoneally and 30 min later morphine (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered subcutaneously. Antinociception was monitored by measuring TF and HP latencies 60 min after the second injection. Midazolam was injected at four different concentrations: 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 3 mg/kg body weight. Chronic administration of morphine resulted in the development of tolerance to antinociception in both TF and HP tests, with rats exhibiting baseline antinociception on Day 9. Animals treated with midazolam alone showed little antinociception on Days 3-9. However, midazolam administration in morphine-treated animals attenuated morphine-induced tolerance to antinociception on Days 1-11 as measured by the tail-flick test. Midazolam also decreased the jumping behavior following naloxone injections in morphine-dependent rats. These results suggest that midazolam may prolong the effects of morphine by delaying morphine-induced development of tolerance to antinociception. Midazolam also attenuated a decrease in weight gain induced by chronic injections of morphine.", 
    "89": "The exocrine pancreatic secretion of control and adrenalectomized rats treated with L-364,718 was studied. The blockade of the action of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) in the control animals was reflected in a reduction of basal pancreatic secretion. This effect was reversed by the administration of submaximal doses of CCK-8. Under treatment with L-364,718, no decrease in pancreatic weight was observed. From this it may be deduced that factors other than CCK act on the pancreas to maintain the processes of enzyme synthesis and storage. Adrenalectomy reduced the weight of the pancreata; the main cause of this was the depletion of zymogen granules, which has been reported in adrenalectomized rats and is accompanied by a reduction in enzyme secretion, especially that of amylase. By contrast, the administration of L-364,718 from the very first moments after adrenalectomy leads to a retention of pancreatic enzymes. This effect is reflected in the maintenance of pancreatic weight and a secretory capacity in response to submaximal doses of CCK-8 similar to that of nonadrenalectomized animals. Accordingly, in the absence of glucocorticoids, endogenous CCK dominates the secretory process because when the action of this secretagogue is prevented by the administration of L-364,718, the discharge of proteins able to be secreted in response to a suitable stimulus is inhibited.", 
    "90": "Spinal cord injury patients are at increased risk for urolithiasis and many will require treatment, most commonly with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. New, second generation lithotripsy devices allow treatment without tub immersion, and without general or regional anesthesia for most patients. Spinal cord injury patients, with loss of sensation below the level of injury, would seem to be ideal candidates for such treatment. We present our experience with 20 consecutive spinal cord injury patients treated without anesthesia on the Medstone STS second generation lithotriptor. All patients were awake and experienced no direct sensation from the shock waves. All but 1 patient (T12 level), however, experienced autonomic dysreflexia, with significant elevations in systolic blood pressure (mean increase 44 mm. Hg, maximum 74) and diastolic blood pressure (mean increase 24 mm. Hg, maximum 61), with reflex bradycardia (mean decrease -22 beats per minute). Autonomic dysreflexia was successfully treated in this setting with short-acting sublingual nifedipine. Associated bradycardia was treated with atropine in 6 patients. Preoperative bowel preparation proved to be useful in spinal cord injury patients to maximize stone imaging and may decrease autonomic dysreflexia if this is caused by shock waves impacting on the distended bowel. Other problems included uncontrolled skeletal muscle spasms elicited by shock waves, which proved to be troublesome in maintaining patient position and stone localization. Muscle spasms were decreased with benzodiazepines. Care was also observed in spinal cord injury patients to pad all pressure points on the hard, dry treatment surfaces associated with second generation lithotriptors and, thus, prevent skin breakdown.", 
    "91": "Using an ultrastructural assay developed to quantify the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide-containing granules, release of the hormone, in response to different degrees of atrial distension, is directly demonstrated at the cellular level. The ultrastructural assay developed uses an in situ tannic acid perfusion technique to arrest the exocytosis of atrial granules in the anesthetized rat. Secretory granules, which retain the capacity to undergo exocytosis throughout a 30-minute tannic acid perfusion, accumulate at the cell surface in a state of fusion with the plasma membrane, with the core contents retained. Quantification of arrested granules thus provides a measure of the rate of granule release and allows the responses to different stimuli to be assessed. By altering the height of the perfusate, perfusion pressure and hence the degree of distension of the right atrium can be increased, and this causes a proportional rise in the release of secretory granules from individual myocytes. An anesthetic regime incorporating fentanyl citrate was found to increase significantly the rate of granule release, and this was further augmented by atrial distension. Quantification of the numbers of cytoplasmic granules under the same conditions did not reveal a reduction in granules. This is thought to be because only a small pool of granules is recruited for exocytosis, and granule production may continue during the perfusion period. Our assay of atrial secretory granule release allows the effect of a variety of stimulatory and inhibitory agents to be assessed directly at the cellular level and provides an independent comparison with previous biochemical data from whole animal and isolated organ studies.", 
    "92": "Rectally administered midazolam (0.35 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.70 mg/kg) were compared with each other and with placebo for preanesthetic medication in children undergoing dental extractions. All rectal medications were very well accepted, but mask acceptance, improvement in anxiety, and sedation were best in the midazolam group. Improvement in anxiety and sedation were significantly better in the two drug groups than in those patients who had received placebo. Thirty minutes after rectal administration of midazolam, patients showed a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Although these decreases differed significantly from the premedication values, they were probably of little clinical importance. Only minor adverse effects were observed in this study. Overall rectally administered midazolam appeared to be somewhat more efficacious than diazepam.", 
    "93": "Long-term potentiation of synpatic transmission (LTP) of the perforant path--dentate gyrus synapse is induced by 5 Hz, theta-like stimulation patterns. Such stimuli induce plasticity that is most likely driven by a decrease in synaptic inhibition (disinhibition) mediated by GABAB autoreceptors. In the present study, we demonstrate that LTP induced in this manner is completely antagonized by ethanol. In order to determine the site of ethanol inhibition of LTP induced by theta-like stimulation, we combined slice patch recordings with pharmacologic isolation of the individual glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents. The present experiments revealed that ethanol inhibited NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents without potentiation of GABAA currents or attenuation of GABAB-mediated fading of GABAA synaptic currents. These observations with ethanol contrasted with the actions of the water-soluble benzodiazepine midazolam, which strongly potentiated GABAA synaptic currents, reversed the effect of GABAB-mediated fading of GABAA synaptic currents, and therefore blocked the resulting NMDA synaptic currents. These data indicate that the effects of ethanol on long-term changes in synaptic strength in the rat hippocampal formation are due primarily to an action at the NMDA receptor-channel complex.", 
    "94": "The multi-injection modeling approach was used for the in vivo quantitation of benzodiazepine receptors in baboon brain using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]flumazenil (RO 15-1788) as a specific ligand. The model included three compartments (plasma, free, and bound ligand) and five parameters (including the benzodiazepine receptor concentration). The plasma concentration after correction for the metabolites was used as the input function. The experimental protocol consisted of four injections of labeled and/or unlabeled ligand. This protocol allows the evaluation, from a single experiment, of the five model parameters in various regions of interest. For example, in the temporal cortex, the concentration of receptor sites available for binding (B'max) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) were estimated to be 70 +/- 15 pmol/ml and 15.8 +/- 2.2 nM, respectively. The validity of the equilibrium approach, which is the most often used quantitation method, has been studied from simulated data calculated using these model parameters. The equilibrium approaches consist of reproducing in PET studies the experimental conditions that permit the use of the usual in vitro methods such as Scatchard analysis. These approaches are often open to criticism because of the difficulty of defining the notion of equilibrium in in vivo studies. However, it appears that the basic relation of Scatchard analysis is valid over a broader range of conditions than those normally used, such as the requirement of a constant bound/free ratio. Simulations showed that the values of the receptor concentration (B'max) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) found using Scatchard analysis are always underestimated. These simulations also suggest an explanation concerning the dependency of B'max and Kd on the time point employed for the Scatchard analysis, a phenomenon found by several authors. To conclude, we propose new protocols that allow the estimation of the B'max and Kd parameters using a Scatchard analysis but based on a protocol including only one or two injections. These protocols being entirely noninvasive, it thus becomes possible to investigate possible changes in receptor density and/or affinity in patients.", 
    "95": "1. The charts of 78 panic disorder outpatients treated with alprazolam (mean dose 4.30 mg/day, mean duration 31.9 months) were reviewed for demographics, past history (including substance abuse and major depression), and evidence of alprazolam abuse. In addition, the patients were evaluated by Clinical Global Index for improvement at last contact. 2. Moderate to significant recovery was found in 77% of patients. Major depression was seen in 41%. Depressed patients were more likely to have coexisting agoraphobia and a past history of alcohol abuse than non-depressives. 3. There was no DSM-III-R anxiolytic abuse, but 12% showed unauthorized use of the alprazolam. These subjects were three times more likely to have a history of drug abuse than non-misusers. 4. These results indicate that alprazolam is effective in the long-term treatment of panic disorder, but that prolonged management may be required. Further, the data raise concerns about use in panic patients with substance abuse histories.", 
    "96": "1. The effects of a number of hypnotics were compared to a range of results collected for triazolam on objective measures of CNS sedation (critical flicker fusion) and short-term memory function (memory scanning). 2. Assessments taken after the drugs had been administered but prior to the onset of sleep showed that in comparison to placebo most of the compounds were effective sedatives and this correlated highly (r = 0.734, p < 0.04) with amnestic effects found at the same time, suggesting that general CNS sedation is a major component of anterograde amnesia. 3. Residual effects assessed the morning after the hypnotics had been used showed a similar relationship (r = 0.896, p < 0.005). 4. The distribution of results indicates that 0.25 mg triazolam has an acute amnestic profile which is similar to other hypnotics, but possesses a distinct lack of residual effects.", 
    "97": "The distribution and down-regulation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) were studied in dissociated cells from right (RCC) and left (LCC) cerebral cortex. For this purpose [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and [3H]pirenzepine (Pz), two muscarinic antagonists, were used. The mAChR binding sites detected with [3H]QNB were asymmetrically distributed between the two hemispheres, the majority being found in the RCC. Asymmetry was also evident in the distribution of the mAChR subtypes (M1 and M2) detected with [3H]Pz. Under basal conditions the RCC had roughly 50% more M1 subtype than the LCC. The pharmacological and kinetic parameters were similar for both antagonists in RCC and LCC, indicating that the observed lateralization was due to a different density of the receptor rather than to different kinetics of binding of the two radioligands. After sustained stimulation with the agonist carbamoylcholine, the receptor sites detected with [3H]Pz, i.e. the M1 subtype of mAChR, decreased at a higher rate in the RCC (44%) than in the LCC (25% of controls), demonstrating that the down-regulation process is more active in the right than in the left cortex, and thus implying that there is better coupling between the stimulated mAChR and its effector system in the former.", 
    "98": "The AMUP study (AMUP = Arzneimittel\u00fcberwachung in der Psychiatrie (Drug Monitoring in Psychiatry)) was conducted from 1979 to 1989 in order to provide for a systematic and standardized assessment of all adverse reactions to psychotropic drugs under the conditions of routine clinical treatment at two psychiatric hospitals. This paper presents data from the AMUP study on the type and frequency of adverse psychic reactions to psychotropic drug groups and relevant single drugs. Psychic ADR leading to drug discontinuation were observed in 4.5% of 15,264 inpatients monitored over an eight-year period. Only neurological ADR were more frequent (4.9%). Neuroleptics and antidepressants were involved with similar frequencies in ADR that were at least \"probably\" drug-related (3.3 and 3.5%). Lithium salts and benzodiazepines were only rarely involved in psychic ADR. Toxic delirium (1.0%), agitation (0.9%), and sedation (0.8%) were the most frequent single events, usually rated as \"probably\" drug-related. Depression and psychotic states were next in frequency, but judged as only \"possibly\" drug-related in a considerable proportion of cases. Haloperidol, the most common high-potency neuroleptic, was imputed mainly for depression, sedation, agitation, and (malignant) neuroleptic syndrome; with medium-potency perazine, toxic delirium and sedation prevailed; among the most common antidepressants, amitriptyline was above all connected with toxic delirium, while with clomipramine agitation predominated. The paper discusses the particular difficulties encountered in the field of psychic ADR in psychiatric patients regarding causality assessment, and emphasizes the need for continuous ADR assessment studies including state hospitals.", 
    "99": "The effects of sex steroid hormones on the different receptor binding sites of the GABAA molecule remain unclear. In this report we have demonstrated, using autoradiography techniques, that the distribution pattern of the benzodiazepine receptors (a component of the GABAA molecule) in some extrahypothalamic brain regions is altered by both in vivo and in vitro sex steroid hormone treatment. In vivo administration of the sex steroids estradiol and progesterone induced a significant change in [3H]flunitrazepam (benzodiazepine agonist) binding levels in the amygdala, and cortico and posterior brain nuclei of the female rat. In fact, elevated and diminished receptor-binding levels were obtained in the corticomedial amygdala nucleus and in the pontine central gray matter respectively, following the administration of estradiol. Significant hormonal effects were also shown for animals that received only a progesterone dose, as demonstrated by the increased and decreased receptor levels in the basolateral amygdala nucleus and cortex lamina VI and in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, respectively. It was interesting, at this point, to investigate whether the hormone effects on [3H]flunitrazepam binding changes might be mediated through a GABA-dependent activity, because the benzodiazepine and GABAA receptors are coupled to a chloride ion channel in an allosteric manner. When 50 microM GABA was added to the incubation medium, substantially altered binding levels were recorded in animals that received progesterone replacement therapy only. The GABA-induced progesterone effects both increased substantially the binding levels in the oriens-pyramidalis CA1 layer of the hippocampus and in the intermediate gray layer of the superior colliculus as well as reducing receptor levels in the substantia nigra pars reticulata.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
