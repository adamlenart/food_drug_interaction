    "0": "The Japanese Society of Mood Disorders (JSMD) published the \"Treatment Guideline II: Major Depressive Disorder, 2012 Ver. 1\" on July 26, 2012. This guideline (GL) is the first one published by an academic society in Japan. Presently in Japan, many people have depressive symptoms, and the socioeconomic loss (suicide, absence from work, etc.) induced by this condition cannot be overlooked. Although the Japanese society, including mass media and psychiatrists, has attempted to solve this public problem, a solution has not been found. JSMD regarded diagnosis and psychiatric management of depression, among other factors, as the key to solving this problem. For example, patients who meet the DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) criteria still have numerous subtypes, and they often have other psychiatric comorbidities that a diagnosis of MDD alone cannot detect. Although the process for differential diagnosis and treatment planning is indispensable, its methodology has not been necessarily shared even among psychiatrists until today. In this GL, considering the research evidence and its limitations, JSMD suggests necessary steps for appropriate information intake, diagnosis, therapeutic alliance formation, psychoeducation, and treatment modality choice in every phase (acute and continuation/maintenance). This GL also considers pharmaco-, psycho-, and electroconvulsive therapy for major depressive subtypes (mild, moderate/severe, and psychotic). Simultaneously, psychiatrists are required to be alert to the risk from diffuse and multiple prescription of benzodiazepine receptor agonists (dependence, deterioration of sleep apnea, cognitive decline, paradoxical reaction, etc.), especially barbiturates. This GL will be revised on the basis of public comments, including criticism. In the future, treatment GLs for comorbid patients, return-to-work cases, primary care physicians, psychiatric residents, and patients with depressions other than MDD (subthreshold depression, dysthymic disorder, and adaptation disorder) may be needed.", 
    "1": "High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) associated with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) are speculated to be linked to the disturbance of higher brain function. We intended to investigate the generative mechanisms of HFOs in CSWS by clarifying the effects of intravenous injection (IV) of diazepam (DZP), an agonist for the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor in the GABAergic interneuron system, in patients who had previously been treated with IV DZP. The subjects were three patients with epilepsy with CSWS. For each patient, EEG data before and after IV DZP were separated into consecutive 5-min sections. Time-frequency power spectral analysis was performed on the spikes of each section, and peak-power and frequency of detected high-frequency spectral spots were compared before and after IV DZP. Spectral spots with peak-frequencies at 85.9-121.1Hz in the ripple band were revealed in all three patients. Although the amplitudes of the spikes largely returned to the baseline levels 20-25min after IV DZP, the recovery of the peak-power levels of HFOs lagged behind that of the spike amplitudes, and the power levels of HFOs were lower than the baseline data within 25min after the injection of DZP. No consistent changes were found regarding the spectral frequencies of HFOs. The dissociation of the effect of IV DZP in terms of recovery when comparing spike-amplitudes and the power of HFOs may correspond to an already suggested difference in the pathophysiological mechanisms that generate the spikes and HFOs.", 
    "2": "GABA(A) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels involved in fast inhibitory neurotransmission and are allosterically modulated by the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative-hypnotic benzodiazepines. Here we show that the prokaryotic homolog ELIC also is activated by GABA and is modulated by benzodiazepines with effects comparable to those at GABA(A) receptors. Crystal structures reveal important features of GABA recognition and indicate that benzodiazepines, depending on their concentration, occupy two possible sites in ELIC. An intrasubunit site is adjacent to the GABA-recognition site but faces the channel vestibule. A second intersubunit site partially overlaps with the GABA site and likely corresponds to a low-affinity benzodiazepine-binding site in GABA(A) receptors that mediates inhibitory effects of the benzodiazepine flurazepam. Our study offers a structural view how GABA and benzodiazepines are recognized at a GABA-activated ion channel.", 
    "3": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory arthritis, of unknown aetiology and a propensity to involve almost all organ systems. The anaesthesiologists should be aware of the associated airway pathologies, pain management techniques and adverse effects of drug therapies being used to treat RA. In this respect, we describe a 60-year-old female patient who presented with a diagnosis of RA with pulmonary fibrosis, and was scheduled for orthopaedic surgery for subcapital fracture of femur which was successfully managed using intrathecal bupivacaine and midazolam.", 
    "4": "Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic used in the short-term treatment of insomnia. A sublingual orally disintegrating tablet formulation of zolpidem (Edluar\u2122; Sublinox\u2122) has been developed to provide a more rapid onset of action than oral immediate-release zolpidem. Sublingual zolpidem has demonstrated bioequivalence to oral zolpidem. In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover, multi-centre study in adult patients with primary insomnia (n\u00a0=\u00a070), a single 10-mg dose of sublingual zolpidem significantly reduced latency to persistent sleep (primary endpoint) compared with a single 10-mg dose of oral immediate-release zolpidem. Sleep-onset latency and latency to stage 1 sleep were also significantly shorter with sublingual zolpidem than with oral zolpidem. Moreover, compared with the oral formulation, sublingual zolpidem was noninferior in terms of total sleep time and did not significantly differ in terms of duration of wake after sleep onset. Sublingual zolpidem was generally well tolerated in this trial, with most adverse events being of mild or moderate severity. The overall tolerability profile of sublingual zolpidem was similar to that of oral zolpidem.", 
    "5": "Clobazam, as with other benzodiazepines, has a long history of use in the treatment of epilepsy. More recently, it was approved in the USA as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged \u22652\u00a0years. In the pivotal, placebo-controlled CONTAIN trial in paediatric and adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a0217 evaluable), adjunctive therapy with clobazam 5-40\u00a0mg/day for 12\u00a0weeks significantly reduced mean weekly drop seizure rates from baseline compared with adjunctive placebo (primary endpoint), with a significant dosage-dependent improvement in these rates. Results from a dosage-ranging, double-blind, multi-centre, phase II trial add further support for the efficacy of clobazam in paediatric and adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a061 evaluable). Improvements in mean weekly drop seizure rates with adjunctive clobazam treatment in these short-term trials was maintained in an ongoing, open-label extension study, with a 91.6\u00a0% reduction in mean weekly drop seizure rates from baseline (at randomization in the initial trials) to 24\u00a0months in the overall population. Treatment with adjunctive clobazam was generally well tolerated in these clinical trials and after at least 2\u00a0years of treatment in an open-label extension study. Most adverse events were mild or moderate and similar to those typically observed with other benzodiazepines.",

    "7": "To examine somatic comorbidity in patients with substance use disorders (SUD) compared to patients with mental disorders but no SUD.", 
    "8": "Lifetime prevalence data on mental and physical health status were collected from inpatients in 12 mental health care facilities in five different countries. Differences in somatic comorbidity were examined by means of logistic regression analysis controlling for age and gender.", 
    "9": "Of 2,338 patients, 447 (19%) had a primary or secondary SUD diagnosis. In comparison to patients with other mental disorders, patients with SUD had a higher prevalence of infectious and digestive diseases but a lower prevalence of endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disorders. Patterns of physical comorbidities differed according to type of substance used (alcohol use - cardiovascular; tobacco use - respiratory, neoplasms; cannabinoid use - injuries; opioid use - infectious, digestive; benzodiazepine use - endocrine, nutritional, metabolic; stimulants - urogenital).", 
    "10": "SUD are related to specific somatic health risks while some of our findings point to potentially protective effects. The widespread prescription of benzodiazepines requires research on physical health effects. Early detection of SUD and their integration into programmes targeting physical comorbidity should be a priority in organizing mental health care.", 
    "11": "Uncontrolled studies suggest that magnesium sulphate controls spasms in patients with established tetanus. We performed a meta-analysis of controlled trials that compared magnesium sulphate with placebo or diazepam for the treatment of patients with tetanus. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase and the Cochrane clinical trials registry. Three studies met the inclusion criteria, containing 275 participants (199 male patients, 72.4%). Magnesium sulphate did not reduce mortality, relative risk (95% CI): vs placebo, 0.80 (0.41-1.58); vs diazepam, 1.11 (0.70-1.75). The data on duration of total intensive care unit stay, total hospital stay and the need for ventilatory support were conflicting and pooling of results could not be done due to methodological differences of individual trials. More controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium sulphate on reducing autonomic instability, spasms, duration of intensive care and hospital stays and the need for mechanical ventilation.", 
    "12": "Effects of EMR on the behavior of Wistar rats (196 males, 180-240 g of mass) under the conflict of opposed motivations: strong positive, drinking, motivation, and strong negative, pain, motivation were studied. The animals were exposed to low intensity EMR (40 microW/cm2) produced by two independent sources, 475 MHz (Albatross) with two orthogonal E vectors, and synchronization of rhythm modulation in the range of electroencephalography (EEG) frequency. The effect on behavior was observed during 10 min: 1) following the 5-minute exposure to EMR and 2) during the 10-minute exposure. Low intensity EMR of the above mentioned parameters and pulse modulation of 4, 8, 10 and 13 Hz was found to inhibit development of phobia to pain, increase the number of punishable contacts. It testifies to the existence of a weak anxiolytic effect which is similar to the effect of tranquilizers. If animals were exposed to EMR following administration of phenazepam, the radiation was shown to produce potentiation of the anxiolytic effect ofphenazepam. Effect of phenazepam is associated with activation ofbenzdiazipine receptors in the structure ofGABA-ergic receptor complex, which regulates neural membrane chloride channel conductance. We can suggest that anxiolytic and neurodepressive effects of EMR are realized to some extent at the level of ionophore and regulatory receptor complexes.", 
    "13": "No strong recommendation was reported in management analgesia and sedation of critically ill children. The present study was performed to describe the current practice of analgesia and sedation in Pediatric Italian Intensive Care Units, in order to evaluate the adherence to last published pediatric guidelines.", 
    "14": "A questionnaire was sent to 24 Italian Paediatric Intensive Care Units during 2010.", 
    "15": "One Hundred percent of contacted centers returned the filled form. All Pediatric Italian Intensive Care Units used the same combination (opioid plus benzodiazepine); 50% of centers referred to regularly monitor the level of sedation, but only 37% of them used validate tools. Withdrawal syndrome was regularly monitored in 25% of contacted Pediatric Italian Intensive Care Units; Finnegan scale was the only adopted scale.", 
    "16": "National pediatric intensivists identified the same drug strategy to obtain analgesia and sedation in their patients, according to last published guidelines. Assessment of analgesia and sedation was more diffuse but not regularly performed and different methods were used. Withdrawal syndrome was monitored in a minority of contacted centres. Considering our data the practice of analgesia and sedation in Italian Pediatric Intensive Care Units is improved but not yet completely adherent to last international recommendations.", 
    "17": "Conscious sedation has become an integral part of dentistry; it is often used to reduce anxiety or fear in some patients during oral surgery, periodontal surgery, implant placement, and general dentistry procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of adverse events during IV conscious sedation provided by credentialed general dentists and periodontists in the United States Air Force (USAF). Sedation clinical records (Air Force Form 1417) from calendar year 2009 were requested from all USAF bases. A total of 1,468 records were reviewed and 19 adverse events were noted in 17 patients. IV complication (infiltration) was the most common adverse event. The overall adverse event rate was 1.3 per 100 patients treated. The results of this study show that moderate sedation provided by general dentists and periodontists in the USAF has a low incidence of adverse events, and conscious sedation remains a viable option for providers for the reduction of anxiety in select patients.", 
    "18": "We describe and compare the antiepileptic drug (AED) management in patients with severe intellectual disability (ID) and those with normal intellect (NI) and focal epilepsy at a tertiary epilepsy center. Fifty patients with ID were compared to a control group of 50 patients with NI; the majority of the patients in both groups had medically refractory epilepsy. Patients with ID were currently taking and had been previously exposed to a greater number of different AEDs. Despite the fact that both groups of patients had beene qually exposed to both old and newer AEDs, patients with ID were more likely to be taking at least one old AED and were more commonly treated with benzodiazepines (clobazam was the most commonly used drug in this group). This difference is likely related to greater seizure frequency and co-morbid behavioral disturbance in the ID group as no bias was identified against utilization of the newer AEDs in patients with ID.", 
    "19": "One of the genes suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BPD) is PDLIM5, which encodes LIM domain protein. Our main objective was to examine the effect of olanzapine treatment on PDLIM5 mRNA expression in the peripheral blood leukocytes of BPD patients.", 
    "20": "We measured the expression of PDLIM5 mRNA from 16 patients with BPD Type I after 0, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment with olanzapine using quantitative real-time PCR. The Young Mania Rating Scale was used to evaluate the severity of manic symptoms in BPD patients. We also compared PDLIM5 mRNA expression in treatment-na\u00efve BPD patients with that in healthy control subjects.", 
    "21": "No significant difference was found in PDLIM5 mRNA expression between patients before olanzapine treatment and following 4 and 8 weeks of treatment (p>0.05). Although we observed a significant reduction in the severity of manic symptoms in all BPD patients (p<0.05), the effectiveness of the medication did not significantly correlate with the expression of PDLIM5 mRNA (p>0.05). Interestingly, PDLIM5 mRNA expression differed significantly between treatment-na\u00efve BPD patients and healthy control subjects (p=0.002).", 
    "22": "PDLIM5 mRNA expression did not appear to be a reflection of the efficacy of olanzapine in reducing the manic symptoms of BPD. The significant difference in expression of PDLIM5 mRNA in the peripheral blood leukocytes of treatment-na\u00efve BPD patients versus that of healthy control subjects, however, suggests that it may be a good biological marker for BPD.", 
    "23": "Members of the asperlicin family of fungal metabolites produced by Aspergillus alliaceus are known potent CCK(A) antagonists. Herein, we report the identification of the gene cluster responsible for directing their biosynthesis. We validate and probe the pathway by genetic manipulation, and provide the first biochemical characterization of the oxidative cyclization en route to the heptacyclic asperlicin E by reconstituting the activity of the FAD depend monooxygenase AspB. This report provides the first genetic characterization of a NRPS assembly line that efficiently activates two anthranilate building blocks and illustrates the remarkably efficient biosynthesis of the complex heptacyclic asperlicin E.", 
    "24": "Clinical outcome following 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) intake ranges from mild entactogenic effects to a life-threatening intoxication. Despite ongoing research, the clinically most relevant mechanisms causing acute MDMA-induced adverse effects remain largely unclear. This complicates the triage and treatment of MDMA users needing medical care. The user's genetic profile and interactions resulting from polydrug use are key factors that modulate the individual response to MDMA and influence MDMA pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and thus clinical outcome. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6, resulting in poor metabolism status, as well as co-exposure of MDMA with specific substances (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) can increase MDMA plasma levels, but can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites and subsequent cellular damage. While pre-exposure to e.g. SSRIs can increase MDMA plasma levels, clinical effects (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) can be reduced, possibly due to a pharmacodynamic interaction at the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). Pretreatment with inhibitors of the dopamine or norepinephrine reuptake transporter (DAT or NET), 5-HT(2A) or \u03b1-\u03b2 adrenergic receptor antagonists or antipsychotics prior to MDMA exposure can also decrease one or more MDMA-induced physiological and/or subjective effects. Carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol can reduce multiple MDMA-induced clinical and neurotoxic effects. Thus besides supportive care, i.e. sedation using benzodiazepines, intravenous hydration, aggressive cooling and correction of electrolytes, it is worthwhile to investigate the usefulness of carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol in the treatment of MDMA-intoxicated patients.", 
    "25": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first-degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.", 
    "26": "Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that, when administered acutely, results in impairments in several aspects of cognition, including attention, learning, and memory. However, the profile (i.e., component processes) that underlie alprazolam-related decrements in visual paired associate learning has not been fully explored.", 
    "27": "In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study of healthy older adults, we used a novel, \"process-based\" computerized measure of visual paired associate learning to examine the effect of a single, acute 1-mg dose of alprazolam on component processes of visual paired associate learning and memory.", 
    "28": "Acute alprazolam challenge was associated with a large magnitude reduction in visual paired associate learning and memory performance (d = 1.05). Process-based analyses revealed significant increases in distractor, exploratory, between-search, and within-search error types. Analyses of percentages of each error type suggested that, relative to placebo, alprazolam challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of exploratory errors and an increase in the percentage of distractor errors, both of which reflect memory processes.", 
    "29": "Results of this study suggest that acute alprazolam challenge decreases visual paired associate learning and memory performance by reducing the strength of the association between pattern and location, which may reflect a general breakdown in memory consolidation, with less evidence of reductions in executive processes (e.g., working memory) that facilitate visual paired associate learning and memory.", 
    "30": "Symptoms of anxiety induced by 7.5% CO\u2082 inhalation can be attenuated by acute administration of GABA(A) receptor anxiolytics such as lorazepam and alprazolam. This study investigated if these effects are dose-related, by comparing a 0.5 mg dose (considered non-clinically effective) and a 2 mg dose of lorazepam (clinically effective) on 7.5% CO\u2082 inhalation. Eighteen healthy males (mean age 20.6 years, SD 1.29), judged physically and mentally fit, attended three visits, each one week apart, to take each treatment in a randomised double-blind crossover design. Drugs were given 60 min prior to 20 min air inhalation, followed by 20 min 7.5% CO\u2082 inhalation. The order of gas presentation was single blind. Subjective ratings using visual analogue scales (VAS) and questionnaires were recorded before and after each inhalation. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and expired CO\u2082 were recorded during each inhalation. Inhalation of 7.5% CO\u2082 significantly raised BP, HR, RR and expired CO\u2082. Ratings of feeling like leaving the room were significantly lower on 2 mg compared with 0.5 mg and placebo, and dose-dependent trends were seen in scores for VAS fearful, anxious, stressed, tense, and worried. Results may be indicative of dose-dependent effects of lorazepam in a CO\u2082 model of anxiety.", 
    "31": "Many women with psychiatric disorders want to become mothers and only a minority seek advise prior to becoming pregnant. In those women, in whom pregnancy can be planned, the decision, if a medication is required for stabilisation and which one to choose if this is the case, is easier to make than in women in whom pregnancy occurs unplanned. The physician has to weigh the risk that a relapse of the psychiatric disorder during pregnancy poses to the foetus against the reproductive risk of psychotropic drugs. This presentation is intended to assist in understanding the general principles of pharmacotherapy during pregnancy as well as the morphological, perinatal and neurobehavioural toxicity of antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and mood stabilisers.", 
    "32": "There are still considerable differences in the medication supply for men and women. While the prescription volumes for both men and women have, for some time, been similar or have even risen for the men, there are still characteristic differences between the sexes when it comes to the prescription of certain indication groups. Women are still prescribed clearly more drugs in the field of psychotropic medication, especially antidepressants, hypnotic drugs, and tranquilisers. As the American Beers criteria for quite some time now and, more recently, the German PRISCUS list have shown, the effects of such drugs are potentially dangerous, particularly for older women. The known adverse effects are, apart from dependence problems, restricted cognitive capacities, insecure or instable walking, and badly healing wounds from falling accidents that are followed by patient's nursing care dependency. In secondary prophylaxis after acute myocardial infarction, the characteristic prescription features of the various medicinal products that are used for both men and women (such as platelet aggregation inhibitors, beta-receptor blockers, ACE-inhibitors, statins) have become similar; women's still higher mortality risk appears to go back to the fact that too much time is spent before proper hospital treatment commences. In general, more attention should be paid to the right medication, the right length of treatment, and the right dosage of the medication prescribed to women; the evidence concerning women's supply of medicinal products should also be improved.", 
    "33": "Antipsychotic drugs suppress animals' ability to avoid an aversive stimulus in the conditioned avoidance response model (CAR). This behavioral effect is thought to reflect antipsychotic activity and is suggested to be mediated by a drug's action in attenuating the motivational salience of a conditioned stimulus (CS). In the present study, we tested whether atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine act through this behavioral mechanism by manipulating the number of avoidance test trials. We reasoned that more CS trials in the presence of clozapine or olanzapine would afford the drug more opportunities to decrease the motivational salience of the CS, thus avoidance decline would be greater with the increase of CS trials in each test session. In two separate experiments, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were tested under clozapine (5.0mg/kg, sc), olanzapine (0.5mg/kg, sc) or vehicle (sterile water) for 6 consecutive days in three CS trial conditions (i.e. 3, 10, and 40 CS trials per session). Two days later, all rats were tested under the same 40-trial session after receiving clozapine (5.0mg/kg, sc) or olanzapine (0.5mg/kg, sc). Results show that repeated clozapine and olanzapine treatment persistently decreased avoidance response, and this effect was potentiated by the increase of number of CS trials in the test sessions, as the clozapine-treated or olanzapine-treated rats tested under the 40-trial or 10-trial condition had significantly lower avoidance and faster decline across-sessions than those tested under the 3-trial condition. This potentiated effect was not only seen in the total avoidance percentage, but also observed in the within-session decline pattern in the last three drug test sessions and in the final 40-trial test session. These findings suggest that the clinical efficacy of a drug can be enhanced by increasing the exposure of symptoms in the presence of the drug.",

    "35": "This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, controlled trial recruited 253 outpatients randomized to receive either brotizolam (n = 126) or estazolam (n = 127) for 14 days followed by 1 week of follow-up for rebound detection. Sleep Dysfunction Rating Scale (SDRS) and Clinical General Impression Scale were applied for efficacy evaluation. Safety evaluation was based on data regarding vital signs, physical examination, lab tests, ECG and collection of adverse events.",

Per Protocol Set (PPS) analysis included data of 235 subjects, with 121 and 114 from each group. After 14 days of treatment, there was no difference with statistical significance between the two groups regarding SDRS total score change from baseline. FAS and PPS analysis showed that the brotizolam is non-inferior to estazolam in efficacy evaluation. There was also no difference with statistical significance regarding rebound rate between brotizolam and estazolam group in FAS.

    "38": "The neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), has been reported to block tolerance formation to alcohol and decrease withdrawal symptoms in alcohol-dependent rodents. Numerous recent studies in human subjects indicate that OT administered by the intranasal route penetrates into and exerts effects within the brain.", 
    "39": "In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, intranasal OT (24 IU/dose, N = 7) or placebo (N = 4) was given twice daily for 3 days in alcohol-dependent subjects admitted to a research unit for medical detoxification using Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) score-driven PRN administration of lorazepam. Subjects rated themselves on the Alcohol Withdrawal Symptom Checklist (AWSC) each time CIWA scores were obtained. Subjects also completed the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale, an Alcohol Craving Visual Analog Scale (ACVAS) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) on inpatient days 2 and 3.", 
    "40": "All subjects had drunk heavily each day for at least 2 weeks prior to study and had previously experienced withdrawal upon stopping/decreasing alcohol consumption. OT was superior to placebo in reducing alcohol withdrawal as evidenced by: less total lorazepam required to complete detoxification (3.4 mg [4.7, SD] vs. 16.5 [4.4], p = 0.0015), lower mean CIWA scores on admission day 1 (4.3 [2.3] vs. 11.8 [0.4], p < 0.0001) and day 2 (3.4 [2.2] vs. 11.1 [3.6], p < 0.002), lower AWSC scores on days 1 and 2 (p < 0.02; p = 0.07), and lower ACVAS ratings (p = 0.01) and lower POMS Tension/Anxiety subscale scores on day 2 (p < 0.01).", 
    "41": "This is the first demonstration that OT treatment may block alcohol withdrawal in human subjects. Our results are consistent with previous findings in rodents that OT inhibits neuroadaptation to and withdrawal from alcohol. OT could have advantages over benzodiazepines in managing alcohol withdrawal because it may reverse rather than maintain sedative-hypnotic tolerance. It will be important to test whether OT treatment is effective in reducing drinking in alcohol-dependent outpatients.", 
    "42": "Neuroimaging data suggest that emotional brain systems are more strongly engaged by moral dilemmas in which innocent people are directly harmed than by dilemmas in which harm is remotely inflicted. In order to test the possibility that this emotional engagement involves anxiety, we investigated the effects of 1 mg and 2 mg of the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam on the response choices of 40 healthy volunteers (20 male) in moral-personal, moral-impersonal, and nonmoral dilemmas. We found that lorazepam caused a dose-dependent increase in participants' willingness to endorse responses that directly harm other humans in moral-personal dilemmas but did not significantly affect response choices in moral-impersonal dilemmas or nonmoral dilemmas. Within the set of moral-personal dilemmas that we administered, lorazepam increased the willingness to harm others in dilemmas where harm was inflicted for selfish reasons (dubbed low-conflict dilemmas) as well as responses to dilemmas where others were harmed for utilitarian reasons (i.e., for the greater good, dubbed high-conflict dilemmas). This suggests that anxiety exerts a general inhibitory effect on harmful acts toward other humans regardless of whether the motivation for those harmful acts is selfish or utilitarian. Lorazepam is also a sedative drug, but we found that lorazepam slowed decision times equally in all 3 dilemma types. This finding implies that its specific capacity to increase ruthlessness in moral-personal dilemmas was not a confound caused by sedation.", 
    "43": "We conducted this single blind randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of oral chloral hydrate and intranasal midazolam for induction of sedation for computerized tomography scan of brain in children. Participants aged 1-10 years (n=60) were randomized to receive 100 mg/kg chloral hydrate orally with intra nasal normal saline OR intranasal midazolam 0.2 mg/kg with oral normal saline. Adequate sedation (Ramsay sedation score of four) was obtained and CT scan completed successfully in 76.7% of chloral hydrate group and in 40% of midazolam group (P=0.004). No significant difference was seen for side effects frequency between the two drugs (10% in chloral hydrate, 3.3% in midazolam group; P=0.34). We conclude that oral chloral hydrate can be considered as a safe and effective drug for sedation in children undergoing CT scan of brain.",

Historically, the underlying cause of sleep disturbance was thought to be due to the effect of periodic breathing.

Instead, it appears that hypoxia has a far wider effect upon sleep at altitude than was previously thought.

Ease of synthesis, water solubility, potency, and difficulty to treat make TMDT a potential weapon for terrorist activity. We characterized TMDT-induced convulsions and mortality in male C57BL/6 mice. TMDT (ip) produced a continuum of twitches, clonic, and tonic-clonic seizures decreasing in onset latency and increasing in severity with increasing dose; 0.4mg/kg was 100% lethal. The NMDA antagonist, ketamine (35mg/kg) injected ip immediately after the first TMDT-induced seizure, did not change number of tonic-clonic seizures or lethality, but increased the number of clonic seizures. Doubling the ketamine dose decreased tonic-clonic seizures and eliminated lethality through a 60min observation period. Treating mice with another NMDA antagonist, MK-801, 0.5 or 1mg/kg ip, showed similar effects as low and high doses of ketamine, respectively, and prevented lethality, converting status epilepticus EEG activity to isolated interictal discharges. Treatment with these agents 15min prior to TMDT administration did not increase their effectiveness. Post-treatment with the GABA(A) receptor allosteric enhancer diazepam (5mg/kg) greatly reduced seizure manifestations and prevented lethality 60min post-TMDT, but ictal events were evident in EEG recordings and, hours post-treatment, mice experienced status epilepticus and died. Thus, TMDT is a highly potent and lethal convulsant for which single-dose benzodiazepine treatment is inadequate in managing electrographic seizures or lethality. Repeated benzodiazepine dosing or combined application of benzodiazepines and NMDA receptor antagonists is more likely to be effective in treating TMDT poisoning.",

Removing undifferentiated cells from the donor population is critical to reduce tumorigenesis. Moreover, immature neural progenitors in transplants can proliferate unpredictably, resulting in neural overgrowth and long-term risks of compressing the surrounding host tissue. Because Notch signaling plays a role in maintaining the multipotency and proliferative capacity of neural progenitors, we used \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) to dampen Notch signaling in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors before transplantation and examined the effects on the growth of proliferative grafts. We observed a marked reduction in the percentage of dividing cells and increased neuronal maturation in GSI-treated samples in vitro. Next, grafts were transplanted into the striata of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficiency mice. Histological analyses performed 8 weeks after the operation showed that grafts pretreated with GSIs--N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester or compound E--were significantly smaller than control samples. Immunohistologic analyses revealed that briefly treating the donor population with GSIs not only reduced the graft volume, but also altered the composition of the graft; control grafts showed neural overgrowth with numerous PAX6+ and Ki67+ neural rosettes, whereas GSI-treated samples developed into mature neuronal grafts containing primarily Tub\u03b23+ cells. These results suggest that pretreating potentially proliferative progenitors with GSIs may improve the safety of cell replacement therapies using pluripotent stem cells.",

This article reviews the pharmacotherapy recommendations from the 2010 revised Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for PTSD and provides practical PTSD treatment recommendations for clinicians. While evidence-based, trauma-focused psychotherapy is the preferred treatment for PTSD, pharmacotherapy is also an important treatment option.

Second-line agents have less evidence for their usefulness in PTSD and carry a potentially greater side effect burden. They include nefazodone, mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Prazosin is beneficial for nightmares. Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, either as monotherapy or used adjunctively, are not recommended in the treatment of PTSD.

    "111": "In DSM-III (1980), depressive states of neurosis and those of manic-depressive illness (melancholia or endogenous depression) were combined into the single category \"major depression,\" which is the progenitor of \"major depressive disorder\" in DSM-IV-TR (2000). According to Hamilton, the word \"depression\" is used in three different ways. In common speech, it is used to describe the state of sadness that all persons experience when they lose something of importance to them. In psychiatry, the word is used to signify an abnormal mood, analogous to the sadness, unhappiness, and misery of everyday experiences. Moreover, the depression discussed in psychiatry often has another quality that makes it distinctive, and this quality appears to be related to an inability to experience any pleasure (anhedonia) regardless of experience. Accordingly, we classify these three uses of the term \"depression\" into sadness, depression, and melancholia in order of appearance within this paper. According to DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive disorder, depression corresponds closely to A1 \"depressed mood\", while melancholia is roughly compatible with A2 \"markedly diminished interest or pleasure.\" Depression and melancholia differ in terms of origin, psychopathology, and therapy. Before DSM-III, depression had not been considered as a diagnosis, but was a ubiquitous symptom that was seen in such conditions as neurasthenia, psychasthenia, nervousness, and neurosis. Melancholia has a history that reaches back to Hippocratic times. Its modern meaning was established based on Kraepelin's manic-depressive illness. Depression is a deepened or prolonged sadness in everyday life, but melancholia has a distinct quality of mood that cannot be interpreted as severe depression. In modern times, depression has been treated with a diverse range of methods, including rest, talk therapy, amphetamines (1930s), meprobamate (1950s), and benzodiazepines (1970s). Melancholia has primarily been treated with somatic therapy, such as electroconvulsive therapy, and tricyclic antidepressants. When preparing diagnostic criteria for DSM-III, Spitzer referred not to DSM-II but to Feighner's (1972) criteria as a model because Feighner's operational criteria were considered to be effective in establishing inter-rater reliability. At the outset, Spitzer established Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC, 1975), which he revised in 1978. In the first edition of RDC, Spitzer adopted most of the Feighner criteria, including essential criteria A \"dysphoric mood\" and eight optional criteria (B1-B8). However, he reduced the minimal morbid duration for diagnosis. Moreover, for the purpose of excluding neurosis from the diagnostic criteria, Spitzer eliminated the distinction between primary and secondary depression, which had been used to differentiate melancholia from depression. In the revised RDC, Spitzer upgraded optional criteria B5 \"loss of pleasure or interest\" to one of the essential criteria A with \"dysphoric mood.\" This revision reflects the fact that \"loss of pleasure or interest\" has been designated as an essential feature of Klein's concept of \"endogenomorphic depression\" (1974), which is equivalent to melancholia or endogenous depression. At that time, depression and melancholia were completely amalgamated into a single category. DSM-III followed almost all of the revisions in the revised RDC and accepted the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy. However, Klein's endogenomorphic depression was downgraded to the specifier \"with melancholia\", which has been used only rarely. Thus, as depression and melancholia were fused into major depressive disorder, we have only limited evidence of the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. DSM-IV divided major depression into major depressive disorder and bipolar II disorder. Consequently, some depression and some melancholia were moved from unipolar depression to bipolar disorder, although the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy was proposed for manic-depressive illness and recurrent unipolar melancholia, but not depression. Therefore, we suspect that we will not obtain strong therapeutic evidence for bipolar II disorder as well.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of liver sinusoidal endothelium fenestrations on the hepatic uptake of the highly protein-bound drug diazepam. We hypothesized that defenestration will reduce the hepatic extraction of drugs which are highly bound to albumin.",

We studied separately chronic (N = 8,037) and recent onset (N = 8,046) schizophrenia patients. Antipsychotic polypharmacy was defined as overlapping of two or more filled prescriptions of antipsychotics for over 60 days.",

    "127": "Facilitation of spinal GABAergic inhibition with benzodiazepines (BZDs) reverses pain sensitization in animals; however, the use of BZDs in man is limited by their sedative effect. The antihyperalgesic effects of GABA(A) agonists are mediated by GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b12 subunits, whereas sedation is linked to \u03b11 subunit-containing receptors. \u03b12 and \u03b13 selective GABA(A) receptor modulators have been tested in animals but are not yet available for use in human beings. Clobazam is a 1,5-BZD, which exhibits less cognitive side effects than other benzodiazepines. Here, we studied its antihyperalgesic effects in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Clobazam showed a dose-dependent antihyperalgesic effect in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, peaking at 1 hr after administration and lasting for 4 hr with no relevant sedation at a dose of 3 mg/kg. At higher doses, the antihyperalgesic effect was stronger, but sedation became significant. The blood and brain kinetics of clobazam were linear over the range of doses tested with a short half-life of the parent compound and a ready penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Clobazam blood concentrations decreased rapidly, falling below the limit of detection at 120 min. after drug application. Its main metabolite, N-desmethyl-clobazam, showed more delayed and prolonged pharmacokinetics, partly explaining why antihyperalgesia persisted when clobazam was no longer detectable in the blood. Considering its therapeutic margin and its pharmacokinetic properties, clobazam would be a valuable compound to assess the role of the GABAergic pathway in pain transmission in human beings.", 
    "128": "This study tested whether lines of Japanese quails divergently selected for a fear response, the tonic immobility, might constitute a reliable bird model for studying anxiety. Previous studies demonstrated that the selection modifies the general underlying emotionality of the birds rather than exerting its effect only on tonic immobility. The behavioural effects of intraperitoneal injections of diazepam, an anxiolytic drug, were assessed in two lines of quail selected either for their short (STI) or long (LTI) duration of tonic immobility. Effects of diazepam were examined in two tests used for measuring emotionality in birds, the open field and the tonic immobility tests. After being placed in the centre of the open field, birds with a high emotionality (LTI quails) stayed longer in the centre of the apparatus than STI quail. Diazepam had anxiolytic effect in LTI birds as it increased the time spent in the outer area. This effect of diazepam appears to be selective because the drug has no effect on other behaviours such as distress calls or escape attempts. The drug has also no effect on the tonic immobility response in any of the two lines. These findings reveal an \"anxiogenic\" trait of LTI birds in the open field test that can be modulated by the administration of an anxiolytic drug. Therefore quails selected for LTI and STI represent a valuable model to study the mechanisms underlying anxiety in birds.", 
    "129": "This study is part of a larger project designed to investigate the prevalence of psychoactive drug (PAD) use among Brazilian drivers. In this paper we describe the development and validation of an analytical method to analyze 32 prescription and illicit PADs (amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabis, opioids, ketamine and m-CPP) and metabolites in oral fluid samples collected with a Quantisal\u2122 device. Samples were extracted with ethyl acetate:hexane and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Instrumental LOD ranged from 0.26 to 0.65 ng/mL. Mean procedural recoveries at 1.3 ng/mL (LLOQ) ranged from 50% to 120% for 24 compounds. Recoveries were concentration independent, with the exception of femproporex, heroin and ecgonine methyl-ester (EME) for which the recovery decreased significantly at higher levels (13 and 52 ng/mL). RSD was <20% for all compounds at all spiking levels. Ion suppression due to the matrix was <20% for most compounds, and higher than 60% for EME and diethylpropion. Analysis was performed against a in-matrix standard curve. About 10% of the 2235 oral fluid samples collected from drivers on Brazilian Federal highways were positive (\u2265LOD) for at least one analyte investigated. Alone or in combination with other drugs, cocaine/metabolites were the analytes most detected in the samples (129; 5.8%), followed by amphetamines/metabolite (69; 3.1%), benzodiazepines (28; 1.2%), cannabinoids (23; 1.1%) and opioids (8; 0.4%). Detection of at least two PADs from different classes accounted for 9.3% of the 236 positive samples. Cocaine was found at higher levels in the samples (up to 1165 ng/mL). Preventive measures aimed at reducing the use of PADs by drivers in Brazil will certainly contribute to decrease the country's highway death rates.",

The present literature revie explores benzodiazepine abuse in this population from a biological, psychological, and environmental perspective. A further objective is the identification of intervention strategies for addressing this problem. The scientific literature reveals a lack of consensus and validity concerning the description of BZD abuse. The prescription practices and somewhat lax attitudes of doctors working with the elderly contribute substantially to the lack of acknowledgement of the magnitude of this problem. Complications specific to the elderly, such as attitudes toward mental illness and differential manifestation of distress, are discussed. Difficulties related to the evaluation of anxiety and depression in elderly patients, have also been identified to contribute too many cases of BZD abuse. In conclusion, it is proposed that research in this area investigate integrative methods for evaluating BZD abuse in the elderly.", 
    "136": "A simple, accurate, and sensitive microextraction by packed sorbent-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method has been developed for the simultaneous quantification of four antiepileptic drugs; oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and alprazolam in human plasma and urine as a tool for drug monitoring. Caffeine was used as internal standards for the electron ionization mode. An original pretreatment procedure on biological samples, based on microextraction in packed syringe using C(18) as packing material gave high extraction yields (69.92-99.38%), satisfactory precision (RSD < 4.7%) and good selectivity. Linearity was found in the 0.1-500 ng/mL range for these drugs with limits of detection (LODs) between 0.0018 and 0.0036 ng/mL. Therefore, the method has been found to be suitable for the therapeutic drug monitoring of patients treated with oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and alprazolam. After validation, the method was successfully applied to some plasma samples from patients undergoing therapy with one or more of these drugs. A comparison of the detection limit with similar methods indicates high sensitivity of the present method over the earlier reported methods. The present method is applied for the analysis of these drugs in the real urine and plasma samples of the epileptic patients.", 
    "137": "Awareness is an essential feature of the human mind that can be directed internally, that is, toward our self, or externally, that is, toward the environment. The combination of internal and external information is crucial to constitute our sense of self. Although the underlying neuronal networks, the so-called intrinsic and extrinsic systems, have been well-defined, the associated biochemical mechanisms still remain unclear. We used a well-established functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm for internal (heartbeat counting) and external (tone counting) awareness and combined this technique with [(18)F]FMZ-PET imaging in the same healthy subjects. Focusing on cortical midline regions, the results showed that both stimuli types induce negative BOLD responses in the mPFC and the precuneus. Carefully controlling for structured noise in fMRI data, these results were also confirmed in an independent data sample using the same paradigm. Moreover, the degree of the GABAA receptor binding potential within these regions was correlated with the neuronal activity changes associated with external, rather than internal awareness when compared to fixation. These data support evidence that the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is an influencing factor in the differential processing of internally and externally guided awareness. This in turn has implications for our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying awareness in general and its potential impact on psychiatric disorders.",

In order to investigate whether early onset of efficacy correlates with week-6 response for the selective fast-dissociating D2 receptor antagonist JNJ-37822681, we analysed data from a 12-week placebo- and active-controlled (olanzapine) study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of JNJ-37822681. Factors, including baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, waist circumference, weight, body mass index group, number of previous hospitalisations, age at diagnosis, race, sex and age at study entry, and relative (%) change from baseline on day 3 (early improvement) in PANSS total score, were analysed using logistic regression models and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, to predict the week-6 efficacy response (\u2265 30% improvement in PANSS total score). Results showed that week-6 response with JNJ-37822681 30 mg bid treatment could be reliably predicted by improvement in PANSS total score on day 3, the number of previous hospitalisations, and race (80% accuracy [ROC area under curve]). Early improvement (day 3) in PANSS score had the highest predictive value as a single factor across all JNJ-37822681 doses. At a specificity of 70%, sensitivity for predicting week-6 response was: 0.60, 0.64, and 0.74 in the 10-, 20-, and 30 mg bid JNJ-37822681 groups, respectively; 0.40 in olanzapine group. Early improvement in PANSS may be a simple and reliable way to predict sustained response with JNJ-37822681 in patients with acute schizophrenia.",

Mean recovery times to both eye opening and to obeying commands were significantly shorter in group PF than those in groups P and PMF, while there were no significant differences among the three groups of etomidate. Compared with the etomidate groups, the incidence of injection-induced pain was significantly higher, while the scores of myoclonus and postoperative nausea and vomiting were lower, in the three propofol groups. Moreover, myoclonus scores as well as nausea and vomiting scores were lower in group EMF than in groups E and EF.",

However, few scientific studies have been conducted with these oils to confirm their therapeutic efficacy. (+)-Limonene is a chemical constituent of various bioactive essential oils. The present study reports on the anxiolytic-like effects of (+)-limonene in an elevated maze model of anxiety in mice. At concentrations of 0.5% and 1.0%, (+)-limonene, administered to mice by inhalation, significantly modified all the parameters evaluated in the elevated plus maze test. The pharmacological effect of inhaled (+)-limonene (1%) was not blocked by flumazenil. Analysis of (+)-limonene using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed its volatility to be high. These data suggest possible connections between the volatility of (+)-limonene and its anxiolytic-like effect on the parameters evaluated in the elevated plus maze test. The data indicate that (+)-limonene could be used in aromatherapy as an antianxiety agent.",

    "149": "An ischemic penumbra has the potential for functional recovery provided that local blood flow can be reestablished, but irreversible damage will develop without sufficient reperfusion, depending on the interaction of severity and duration of ischemia. With acute flows below the threshold required for maintenance of basic housekeeping, injury in the core is established within a few minutes. During the subacute phase, the irreversible damage expands into the penumbra: multiple electrical and biological signals are triggered by periinfarct, spreading depression-like depolarizations leading to hypoxia and stepwise increase in lactate. Usually within 6 to 8 hours, all the penumbra are converted into irreversible infarcts. In a delayed phase, secondary phenomena may cause additional tissue damage: disruption of the tight junctions results in vasogenic edema, leading to increase of water content and damage expansion. Neutrophils and cytokinins cause secondary inflammation, inducing further damage in periinfarct regions and connecting fiber tracts. Multimodal imaging might be able to differentiate among the tissue compartments affected by acute, subacute, or delayed ischemic damage, and thereby might provide the basis for phase-specific treatment strategies.", 
    "150": "Ammonia is metabolized by the liver and has established neurological effects. The current study examined the possibility that ammonia contributes to the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine (METH). The results show that a binge dosing regimen of METH to the rat increased plasma and brain ammonia concentrations that were paralleled by evidence of hepatotoxicity. The role of peripheral ammonia in the neurotoxic effects of METH was further substantiated by the demonstration that the enhancement of peripheral ammonia excretion blocked the increases in brain and plasma ammonia and attenuated the long-term depletions of dopamine and serotonin typically produced by METH. Conversely, the localized perfusion of ammonia in combination with METH, but not METH alone or ammonia alone, into the striatum recapitulated the neuronal damage produced by the systemic administration of METH. Furthermore, this damage produced by the local administration of ammonia and METH was blocked by the GYKI 52466 [4-(8-methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepin-5-yl)-benzamine hydrochloride], an AMPA receptor antagonist. These findings highlight the importance of ammonia derived from the periphery as a small-molecule mediator of METH neurotoxicity and more broadly emphasize the importance of peripheral organ damage as a possible mechanism that mediates the neuropathology produced by drugs of abuse and other neuroactive molecules.", 
    "151": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) significantly affects quality of life. We recently cloned synoviolin, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Synoviolin is highly expressed in rheumatoid synovial cells and may be involved in the pathogenesis of RA. Inhibition of synoviolin activity is a potentially useful therapeutic approach for the treatment of RA. We conducted a high-throughput screen of small molecules to find inhibitors of synoviolin autoubiquitination activity. We identified two classes of small molecules, named LS-101 and LS-102, which inhibited synoviolin activity. LS-102 selectively inhibited synoviolin enzymatic activity, while LS-101 inhibited a broad array of RING-type E3 ligases. Moreover, these inhibitors suppressed the proliferation of rheumatoid synovial cells, and significantly reduced the severity of disease in a mouse model of RA. Our results suggest that inhibition of synoviolin is a potentially useful approach in the treatment of RA.", 
    "152": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is critical for the endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stressors, and it has been shown to modulate fear and anxiety. The CRF receptor is widely expressed across a variety of cell types, impeding progress toward understanding the contribution of specific CRF-containing neurons to fear dysregulation. We used a unique CRF-Cre driver transgenic mouse line to remove floxed GABA(A)\u03b11 subunits specifically from CRF neurons [CRF-GABA(A)\u03b11 KO]. This process resulted in mice with decreased GABA(A)\u03b11 expression only in CRF neurons and increased CRF mRNA within the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. These mice show normal locomotor and pain responses and no difference in depressive-like behavior or Pavlovian fear conditioning. However, CRF-GABA(A)\u03b11 KO increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired extinction of conditioned fear, coincident with an increase in plasma corticosterone concentration. These behavioral impairments were rescued with systemic or BNST infusion of the CRF antagonist R121919. Infusion of Zolpidem, a GABA(A)\u03b11-preferring benzodiazepine-site agonist, into the BNST of the CRF-GABA(A)\u03b11 KO was ineffective at decreasing anxiety. Electrophysiological findings suggest a disruption in inhibitory current may play a role in these changes. These data indicate that disturbance of CRF containing GABA(A)\u03b11 neurons causes increased anxiety and impaired fear extinction, both of which are symptoms diagnostic for anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder.",

Although it is well known that anoxic or hypoxic injury produces acute neurologic deficits, DPL typically manifests days to weeks after apparent recovery from an obtunded state, and patients with DPL demonstrate cognitive impairment, high brain dysfunction, parkinsonism, or psychosis. MRI findings of the brain demonstrate deep white matter abnormalities. We report 2 cases of DPL after hypoxia due to benzodiazepine overdose. Both of our patients had normal arylsulfatase A activity. Although DPL is seen in carbon monoxide poisoning, pseudodeficiency of arylsulfatase A activity, or drug overdose with heroin or morphine, there are only some previous studies of DPL caused by an overdose with benzodiazepine. It is unclear whether neurotoxicity from the drug in addition to hypoxia alone is involved, however, it is important to note that overdose of common drugs as sleeping medicine can cause DPL. Since DPL may often be misdiagnosed and be subjected to unnecessary treatments, it is also important to understand its unique clinical course and MRI findings. With prompt recognition of DPL, we expect that more cases of DPL caused by overdose with benzodiazepine will be diagnosed, because benzodiazepine overdoses are common.",

The etomidate (24%) and phenytoin/midazolam (16%) treatments were most effective in preventing lethality (P<0.001). Conversely, compared to the vehicle group (72%), cocaine-induced lethality was higher in the ketamine (84%) and phenytoin (92%) groups. All treatments prolonged the time to seizure, but this effect was most pronounced in the etomidate and phenytoin/midazolam groups, which also had the longest average time to lethality.", 
    "165": "The present study provides the first experimental evidence supporting the use of etomidate to treat cocaine-induced seizures. Notably, ketamine and phenytoin were ineffective.

Factors associated with PPX effectiveness were examined: the ratio of REM sleep without atonia to total REM sleep (RWA/REM), length of RBD morbidity, frequency of vocalization or abnormal behavior, and Sniffin' Stick Test scores. These factors were also compared among the responders to PPX monotherapy, CNZP monotherapy, and PPX\u00a0+\u00a0CNZP combined therapy.",

Impairments observed following doses of 100-300 mg/70 kg DXM were generally smaller in magnitude than those observed after 0.5mg/70 kg triazolam. Doses of DXM that impaired performance to the same extent as triazolam were in excess of 10-30 times the therapeutic dose of DXM.", 
    "173": "The magnitude of the doses required for these effects and the absence of effects on some tasks within the 100-300 mg/70 kg dose range of DXM, speak to the relatively broad therapeutic window of over-the-counter DXM preparations when used appropriately. However, the administration of supratherapeutic doses of DXM resulted in acute cognitive impairments on all tasks that were examined. These findings are likely relevant to cases of high-dose DXM abuse.",

Serious physiological, psychological, social and legal problems are thought to affect many more. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a potentially life-threatening condition that often occurs in those individuals who significantly reduce or stop their intake after a prolonged and excessive period of drinking. Pharmacological treatment of the AWS has traditionally been undertaken by the use of the benzodiazepines, but recent years have witnessed the emergence of several alternatives. The aim of this paper was (1) to review the evidence base supporting the use of various pharmacological agents currently employed to treat AWS, and (2) to consider the efficacy and safety of the emerging alternatives to the benzodiazepines. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and BNI databases were extensively searched in order to retrieve the maximum number of relevant articles. Reference lists from relevant literature were also used to identify other potential studies for inclusion. All studies concerned with measuring the efficacy and safety of the various pharmacological treatment options for AWS were considered and a total of 63 trials were included in this review. Findings support the use of benzodiazepines as the recommended drug of choice for the treatment of AWS in the absence of adequate evidence to support the use of alternative agents. There is a lack of evidence of a superior pharmacological agent to the benzodiazepines for the treatment of AWS. There are several studies that have shown that there are pharmacological alternatives that could compete or act as an adjunct with the benzodiazepines in terms of high efficacy and safety in the treatment of AWS, but there is a need for further quality research to be carried out before definitive conclusions can be drawn.",

In the absence of a proper drug history, the diagnosis becomes challenging. Proper clinical assessment, urine assays and imaging play a very important role in reaching the diagnosis. We present a case of acute benzodiazepine poisoning without a history of drug intake. The key pointers toward diagnosis were an unarousable state with obstructive apnea.

Failure to detect mania leads to misdiagnosis and suboptimal treatment. To diagnose mania, clinicians should include a detailed mood history within their assessment of patients presenting with depression, agitation, psychosis or insomnia. With regards to treatment, by synthesizing the findings from recent treatment guidelines, and reviewing relevant literature, this paper has distilled recommendations for both acute and long-term management. Antimanic agents including atypical antipsychotics and traditional mood stabilizers are employed to reduce acute manic symptoms, augmented by benzodiazepines if needed, and in refractory or severe cases with behavioural and/or psychotic disturbance, electroconvulsive therapy may occasionally be necessary. Maintenance/prophylaxis therapy aims to reduce recurrences/relapse, for which the combination of psychological interventions with pharmacotherapy is beneficial as it ensures adherence and monitoring of tolerability.", 
    "181": "GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) mediate robust analgesia in animal models of pathological pain, in part via enhancing injury-induced loss of GABA-A-\u03b12 and -\u03b13 receptor function within the spinal cord. As yet, a lack of clinically suitable tool compounds has prevented this concept being tested in humans. Prior to assessing the efficacy of GABA-A receptor PAMs in a human volunteer pain model we have compared compounds capable of variously modulating GABA-A receptor function in comparable rat models of capsaicin-induced acute nocifensive flinching behaviour and secondary mechanical hypersensitivity. The subtype-selective PAM NS11394 (0.3-10\u00a0mg/kg), and the non-selective PAM diazepam (1-5\u00a0mg/kg) variously reduced capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hypersensitivity (180\u00a0min post-injection). However, the low efficacy subtype-selective PAM TPA023 (3-30\u00a0mg/kg) was completely ineffective. This was surprising as both NS11394 and TPA023 robustly attenuated late phase (6-30\u00a0min post-injection) capsaicin-induced flinching, a pain-like behaviour that is putatively driven by peripheral and central sensitizing mechanisms. Diazepam also attenuated capsaicin-induced nocifensive behaviours, albeit at doses previously shown to impair locomotor function. Our data indicate that GABA-A receptor PAMs with optimal selectivity and efficacy profiles reduce centrally-mediated mechanical hypersensitivity in capsaicin-injected rats, an observation that we expect can translate directly to human volunteer studies.",

In 22 patients with SCS, 10 with overt Cushing's syndrome (CS), 11 with non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas (NF) and 14 normal subjects (NS) we studied the effect of ALP (1 mg, p.o. at 2300 hours) on cortisol levels after 1-mg DST. Cortisol levels (mean \u00b1 SEM) after DST were lower (P = 0.012) in SCS (3.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/dl) than in overt CS (10.4 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcg/dl), while they were higher (P = 0.0005) than in NF (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg/dl) and NS (1.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg/dl). After ALP pre-treatment, cortisol levels further decreased (P = 0.004) in SCS (3.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/dl), but neither in CS (9.3 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcg/dl) nor in NF (1.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg/dl) and in NS (1.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg/dl). In SCS, cortisol levels after ALP + 1-mg DST persisted lower (P = 0.0005) than those in CS, but higher (P = 0.0005) than those in NF and NS. Considering individual cases, ALP pre-treatment reduced cortisol levels < 3 and < 1.8 \u03bcg/dl in 50 and 23 % of SCS patients, respectively. ALP amplifies the cortisol inhibition exerted by 1-mg DST in patients with SCS but not in those with CS. The clinical usefulness of ALP to increase the sensitivity of 1-mg DST to identify true autonomous cortisol release in patients with adrenal incidentalomas as well as to predict different clinical outcomes remains to be clarified.", 
    "195": "The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of midazolam given intranasally with diazepam given intravenously in the treatment of acute childhood seizures. A randomized controlled study was conducted in a pediatric emergency department in a tertiary general hospital. Fifty children aged from 1 month to 12 years presenting with acute seizures of at least 10 min duration were enrolled during a 12 month period. Intranasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and intravenous diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) were administered. The main outcome measures were interval between arrival at hospital and starting treatment and interval between arrival at hospital and cessation of seizures. Intranasal midazolam and intravenous diazepam were equally effective. Overall 18 of 27 seizures were controlled with midazolam and 15 of 23 with diazepam. The mean interval between arrival at hospital and starting treatment was significantly shorter in the midazolam group [3.37 min (SD 2.46)] as compared to the diazepam group [14.13 min (SD 3.39)]. The mean interval between cessation of seizures and arrival at hospital was significantly shorter in the midazolam group [6.67 min (SD 3.12)] as compared to the diazepam group [17.18 min (SD 5.09)]. The mean interval between control of seizures and administration of the drug was shorter in the diazepam group [2.67 min (SD 2.31)] as compared to the midazolam group [3.01 min (SD 2.79)]. No significant side effects were observed in either group. Seizures were controlled more quickly with intravenous diazepam than with intranasal midazolam. Midazolam was as safe and effective as diazepam. The overall interval between arrival at hospital and cessation of seizures was shorter with intranasal midazolam than with intravenous diazepam. The intranasal route can be possibly used not only in medical centres, but with appropriate instruction by the parents of children with acute seizures at home.",

Furthermore six systematic reviews exist. Evidence for any drug used as an antiemetic is low. Concerning 5HT3 receptor antagonists data are insufficient for recommendations on the treatment of patients with AIDS and MS due to the small size of included patient groups. For patients with cancer contradictory results were published: the larger studies showed a positive effect of 5HT3 receptor antagonists and better efficacy, as compared to metoclopramide, dexamethasone and neuroleptics. Heterogeneous results were found for steroids, with a positive trend for patients with cancer. Data are insufficient for antihistamines. Studies prove effectiveness of butylscopolammonium in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by malignant gastrointestinal obstruction, whereas octreotide is superior to butylscopolammonium. Regarding benzodiazepines for symptom control of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients no studies were detected. Cannabinoids were found to relieve nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer and AIDS but with notable side effects. Furthermore, the studies compared cannabinoids to less recent antiemetic drugs but not, for example to 5HT3 receptor antagonists.

There is a trend that steroids in combination with other antiemetics improve symptom relief. Cannabinoids rather have a status as a second line antiemetic. In cases of nausea and vomiting caused by malignant gastrointestinal obstruction octreotide showed the best and butylscopolammonium bromide the second best results. Concerning antihistamines and benzodiazepines insufficient data was found. Recommendations in the literature are mainly based on studies in patients with cancer.

    "201": "Clobazam (CLB) is known to increase hepatobiliary thyroxine (T4) clearance in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, which results in hypothyroidism followed by thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy. However, the mechanism of the acceleration of T4-clearance has not been fully investigated. In the present study, we tried to clarify the roles of hepatic UDP-glucronosyltransferase (UGT) isoenzymes (UGT1A and UGT2B) and efflux transporter (multidrug resistance-associated protein-2; MRP2) in the CLB-induced acceleration of T4-clearance using two mutant rat strains, UGT1A-deficient mutant (Gunn) and MRP2-deficient mutant (EHBR) rats, especially focusing on thyroid morphology, levels of circulating hormones (T4 and triiodothyronine (T3)) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and mRNA or protein expressions of UGTs (Ugt1a1, Ugt1a6, and Ugt2b1/2) and MRP2 (Mrp). CLB induced thyroid morphological changes with increases in TSH in SD and Gunn rats, but not in EHBR rats. T4 was slightly decreased in SD and Gunn rats, and T3 was decreased in Gunn rats, whereas these hormones were maintained in EHBR rats. Hepatic Ugt1a1, Ugt1a6, Ugt2b1/2, and Mrp2 mRNAs were upregulated in SD rats. In Gunn rats, UGT1A mRNAs (Ugt1a1/6) and protein levels were quite low, but UGT2B mRNAs (Ugt2b1/2) and protein were prominently upregulated. In SD and Gunn rats, MRP2 mRNA and protein were upregulated to the same degree. These results suggest that MRP2 is an important contributor in development of the thyroid cellular hypertrophy in CLB-treated rats, and that UGT1A and UGT2B work in concert with MRP2 in the presence of MRP2 function to enable the effective elimination of thyroid hormones.", 
    "202": "Dominance and submissiveness are two opposite poles of behavior representing important functional elements in the development of social interactions. We previously demonstrated the inheritability of these traits by selective breeding based upon the dominant-submissive relationships (DSR) food competition paradigm. Continued multigenerational behavioral selection of Sabra mice yielded animal populations with strong and stable features of dominance and submissiveness. We found that these animals react differentially to stressogenic triggers, antidepressants and mood stabilizing agents. The anxiolytic compound diazepam (1.5mg/kg, i.p.) reduced anxiety-like behavior of submissive animals, but showed anxiogenic effects among dominant animals. In the Forced Swim test, the antidepressant paroxetine (1, 3 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) markedly reduced immobility of submissive animals, demonstrating antidepressant-like effect. In contrast, when administered to dominant animals, paroxetine caused extreme (frenetic) activity. The mood stabilizer lithium (0.4%, p.o.) selectively influenced dominant mice, without affecting the behavior of submissive animals. In summary, we describe here two distinct animal populations possessing strong dominant and submissive phenotypes. We suggest that these populations hold potential as tools for studying the molecular basis and pharmacogenetics of dominant and submissive behavior.",

    "207": "Potent organophosphorous (OP) agents, such as VX, are hazardous by absorption through the skin and are resistant to conventional pharmacological antidotal treatments. The residence time of a stoichiometric bioscavenger, human butyrylcholinesterase (huBuChE), in the plasma more closely matches that of VX than do the residence times of conventional therapy drugs (oxime, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant). Intramuscular (i.m.) huBuChE afforded almost complete protection when administered prior to the onset of observable cholinergic signs of VX poisoning, but once signs of poisoning became evident the efficacy of i.m. huBuChE decreased. A combination of nerve agent therapy drugs (oxime, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant) with huBuChE (i.m.) protected 100% (8/8) of guinea-pigs from a lethal dose of VX (0.74 mg/kg) to 48 h, even when administered on signs of poisoning. Survival was presumed to be due to immediate alleviation of the cholinergic crisis by the conventional pharmacological treatment drugs, in conjunction with bioscavenger that prevented further absorbed agent reaching the AChE targets. Evidence to support this proposed mechanism of action was obtained from PKPD experiments in which multiple blood samples and microdialysate samples were collected from individual conscious ambulatory animals. Plasma concentrations of intramuscularly-administered atropine, diazepam and HI-6 reached a peak within 15 min and were eliminated rapidly within 4h. Plasma concentrations of huBuChE administered by the i.m. route took approximately 24h to reach a peak, but were well-maintained over the subsequent 7days. Thus, the pharmacological therapy rapidly treated the initial signs of poisoning, whilst the bioscavenger provided prolonged protection by neutralising further nerve agent entering the bloodstream and preventing it from reaching the target organs.", 
    "208": "The discovery of benzodiazepine receptors provided the impetus to discover and develop anxioselective anxiolytics ('Valium without the side effects'). The market potential for an anxioselective based on the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor resulted in clinical trials of multiple compounds. In contrast to the anxioselective profile displayed in preclinical models, compounds such as bretazenil, TPA023, and MRK 409 produced benzodiazepine-like side effects (sedation, dizziness) in Phase I studies, whereas alpidem and ocinaplon exhibited many of the characteristics of an anxioselective in the clinic. Alpidem was briefly marketed for the treatment of anxiety, but was withdrawn because of liver toxicity. Reversible elevations in liver enzymes halted development of ocinaplon in Phase III. The clinical profiles of these two molecules demonstrate that it is possible to develop GABA(A) receptor-based anxioselectives. However, despite the formidable molecular toolbox at our disposal, we are no better informed about the GABA(A) receptors responsible for an anxioselective profile in the clinic. Here, I discuss the evolution of a quest, spanning four decades, for molecules that retain the rapid and robust anti-anxiety actions of benzodiazepines without the side effects that limit their usefulness.", 
    "209": "There remains an unmet medical need in the out-of-hospital management of seizure emergencies because older children and adults often refuse treatment with diazepam rectal gel due to social objections. We have previously reported that intranasal diazepam (DZP) administration is feasible, with maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) and time to maximum concentration (T(max)) that are comparable to rectal DZP; but tolerability was poor. In the present study, the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of two investigational nasal formulations were compared with DZP rectal gel. Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled into an active-control, double-blind, four-period, crossover pharmacokinetic and tolerability study. Three intranasal treatments (Nas-A 10mg, Nas-B 10mg and Nas-B 13.4 mg) were compared to a 10mg dose of the rectal gel. A single dose of each formulation was administered followed by at least a 14 day washout period. Blood samples for plasma DZP concentration-time characterization were collected pre-dose and at regular intervals to 240 h post-dose. Tolerability and sedation were assessed using visual analog scales. Mean DZP C(max) (\u00b1SD) was 181.8 \u00b1 84.16, 151.3 \u00b1 108.1 and 180.7 \u00b1 82.1 ng/mL for Nas-A 10mg, Nas-B 10 and Nas-B 13.4 mg respectively; in comparison the C(max) for the rectal gel was 160.9 \u00b1 109.4 ng/mL. Median T(max) was 0.75 h for all treatments. Both intranasal formulations were well tolerated and exhibited relatively rapid, but variable, absorption with bioavailability of 70-90% relative to DZP rectal gel. This study shows that the development of a well-tolerated nasal formulation is possible and that the rate and extent of absorption approximates that of DZP rectal gel. We conclude that intranasal DZP offers a viable alternative to rectal administration, but enhancement of formulations is needed to improve the extent and consistency of absorption.", 
    "210": "Cocaine is a potent sympathomimetic drug that is associated with cardiotoxicity, including ventricular arrhythmia, systemic hypertension, acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy. The use of cocaine in Australia has risen steadily since the late 1990s. What remains unclear in the literature is whether cocaine-associated death can occur in the absence of other contributing factors, such as concomitant drug use or natural disease. A search was conducted on the National Coroners Information System database, to identify all deaths occurring in Victoria, Australia, between January 2000 and December 2011, where cocaine or its metabolites were detected by post-mortem toxicological analysis. All cases were closed by the Coroner. These cases were examined with regards to case circumstances, pathology and toxicology results, and coronial findings, to determine the prevalence of cardiotoxicity and the involvement of cocaine in the deaths compared with other contributing factors. There were 49 cases where cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester, methylecgonine or cocaethylene, were detected in the 11-year period. The individuals ranged in age from 16 to 70 years (median 30). There were 36 males. In 22 cases the cause of death was determined to be drug toxicity, 22 were external injury and 5 were attributed to natural disease. The concentration of cocaine in the cases was relatively low (range 0.01-3 mg/L, median 0.1 mg/L). Cocaine metabolites were detected frequently in blood and urine: benzoylecgonine (46 cases); ecgonine methyl ester (12 cases); cocaethylene (8 cases); and methylecgonine (9 cases). Opioids were commonly detected (23 cases), in addition to amphetamines (15 cases), ethanol (17 cases) and benzodiazepines (12 cases). Of the 43 cases receiving a full autopsy, there were 14 cases involving significant heart disease. This included coronary artery disease (11 cases), an enlarged heart (5 cases), myocarditis and contraction band necrosis. Cocaine is detected relatively infrequently in Victorian coronial cases. However it appears to be associated with a significant degree of cardiotoxicity, particularly coronary artery disease and ventricular hypertrophy, independent of cocaine concentration.", 
    "211": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain stimulation technique that has been investigated as a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders, notably in major depression, and has shown statistically significant effects. The authors found it necessary to propose an up-to-date review of positive predictors for antidepressive response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.", 
    "212": "Based on an exhaustive consultation of Medline data, supplemented by a manual research, only works evaluating response factors of rTMS in major depression were retained.", 
    "213": "Twenty-nine studies were retained, including meta-analyses, reviews, randomized controlled trials and open trials. The most concordant data clearly indicate that a high score of treatment resistance, a long duration of current episode, advanced age, and psychotic symptoms are negative predictors for treatment response to rTMS. In the older patients, menopausal women are especially concerned. However, some parameters should be adapted to the degree of cortical atrophy such as intensity of stimulation or total number of rTMS sessions. Previous response to rTMS therapy seems to be a good predictor contrary to non-response to electroconvulsive therapy. Adjunctive antidepressant treatment shows greater responsiveness to rTMS contrary to benzodiazepine or anticonvulsant treatment. To our knowledge, no study compares unipolar and bipolar depression, the profile of depression is not established yet. Imaging studies show that TMS antidepressant responders differed from non-responders in inferior frontal activity, at baseline, and even more so following treatment. Furthermore, reduced baseline cerebral metabolism in cerebellar, temporal, anterior cingulate and occipital regions of the brain was correlated with improvement after two weeks of fast (20Hz) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) rTMS. Additionally, a right frontal region emerges with divergent polarity in the metabolic prediction of response to low rTMS. Inhibiting right DLPFC or stimulating DLPFC shows similar results, the choice on the side of stimulation does not seem determining. Bilateral stimulation for the moment does not seem superior to unilateral stimulation. Parameters of stimulation associated with effectiveness of rTMS are an intensity of stimulation higher than 100% of the motor threshold, a number of stimulations per sessions superior to 1000, and a full number of days of treatment greater than 10.", 
    "214": "Parameters of stimulation must be adapted according to the treated patients. For example, older patients who present cortical atrophy need higher intensity of stimulation. Other criteria could influence effectiveness of rTMS in the same way. Would it be necessary, for example, to adapt the duration or the intensity of stimulation according to the severity of the depressive episode or its duration of evolution? Do antecedents of resistance to a pharmacological treatment oblige us to stimulate differently? Few studies exceed 10 days of treatment; will longer duration of treatment be more effective? Also, we did not find any data on the interest of maintenance treatment among responders. Should the characteristics of the depressive disorder or its evolution require maintenance treatment? What will be its rhythm and its duration? Should we adapt rTMS parameters to abnormalities highlighted by functional neuroimagery? The prospects for work remain numerous.", 
    "215": "Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, and even more among psychiatric patients, but rarely seen as a sign of seriousness. It is a cause of death by suffocation, and more or less serious complications, and therefore should be diagnosed and treated. Among psychiatric patients, organic and iatrogenic aetiologies, as well as risk factors are identified, which worsen this symptom when associated. It is now accepted that neuroleptics can aggravate or cause dysphagia. They act by several pathophysiological ways on the different components of swallowing, which can be identified by dynamic tests in the upper aerodigestive tract endoscopy.", 
    "216": "This symptom is rarely reported by patients and often underestimated by caregivers. The frequency of swallowing disorders is not known. Dysphagia is a cause of complications and an increase in mortality rates among psychiatric patients. It has also been found that the average number of psychotropic drugs in patients who die by cafe coronary is significantly higher than in other patients. There are several phases in swallowing: oral, pharyngeal, and oesophageal. Swallowing disorders can affect each of these phases, or several at once: (a) Extrapyramidal syndrome: dysphagia is present in drug induced Parkinson's syndromes, but prevalence is not known. It is most often associated with another symptom of the extrapyramidal syndrome, but can also be isolated, making its diagnosis more difficult. Dysphagia is due to a slowing down in the oral and pharyngeal reflex, called bradykinesia; (b) Tardive dyskinesia: the oro-pharyngo-oesophageal dyskinesia is the most common type. Oesophageal dyskinesia causes asynchronous and random movements of the oesophagus, resulting in dysphagia. It appears mostly beyond 3 months of treatment with neuroleptics; (c) Acute laryngeal or oesophageal dystonia, associated or not with orofacial dystonia, is characterised by an impairment in the oesophageal muscle contraction and a hypertonia of the upper sphincter of the oesophagus; (d) Polyphagia or \"binge eating\", is frequent in psychotic patients; (e) Finally, there are risk factors for dysphagia: xerostomia, poor dental status, advanced age, neurological diseases, polypharmacy, sedative drugs, CNS depression, etc., which worsen the symptom.", 
    "217": "Mr J., aged 28, with no psychiatric history, is admitted to the Unit for Difficult Patients in Villejuif for behavioural disorder with homicide on the street. The patient was restrained by passers-by and suffers a head injury and a fracture of the transverse process of L1 vertebra. A cranial CT scan is performed in the emergency room, it is normal. The patient is not known to psychiatric services, and has never taken neuroleptics. Mr J. is homeless, known in his neighbourhood for \"his noisy delirium on the street and repeated alcohol abuse.\" After being arrested by the police in this context, a first psychiatric examination is conducted. The medical certificate states that his condition is not compatible with custody. Mr J. remains mute; he has stereotyped gestures and strange attitudes. No delusion is verbalized. He receives vials of loxapine 50mg causing sedation. At his arrival in the department, Mr J. has the same clinical picture, with a rigid and inexpressive face, reluctance, major unconformity, poor speech. The search for drugs in urine is positive for cannabis. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is rapidly raised, motivating further prescription of loxapine 300 mg daily in combination with clonazepam 6 mg daily. From the earliest days, dysphagia to solids with choking and regurgitation is noted, aggravated by the increase of loxapine treatment of 450 mg / day to 700 mg / day, 7 days after admission. A physical examination is performed before the worsening of dysphagia, it is normal, and in particular, reveals no extrapyramidal syndrome. An anti-cholinergic corrector is introduced, without clinical improvement. A new physical examination is performed; it is normal except for sedation and a slight deviation of the uvula. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows no anatomical lesion. No functional assessment of swallowing is done however. At this stage, the suspicion of neuroleptic induced dysphagia appears to be the most likely hypothesis. Treatment with loxapine is then stopped, resulting in a very rapid clinical improvement. Aripiprazole 15 mg / d is introduced. Dysphagia does not reoccur.", 
    "218": "Loxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, with a lower risk of neurological side effects than first generation of antipsychotics. These side effects are however numerous and from diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Loxapine is an antagonist of dopamine and serotonin which is involved in the regulation of several neurotransmitters, explaining the multiple mechanisms involved in the onset of dysphagia: first, blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum, causing motor side-effects of central origin, in addition to peripheral effects of the molecule, which impairs swallowing. In principle, the antagonist activity on serotonin 5-HT2A receptors increases dopaminergic activity in the striatum, reducing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, without avoiding them completely. In addition to these mechanisms, cholinergic blockade reduces oesophageal mobility and pharyngeal reflex. Moreover, the antihistamine, anti-cholinergic and adrenergic receptor blocking alpha-1 can cause sedation, which aggravates the symptom. Finally, the depression of the bulbar centres reduces the swallowing reflex and gag reflex altering the intake of food.", 
    "219": "The swallowing disorder caused by neuroleptics may occur regardless of the molecule or drug class to which it belongs. It can be found even in the absence of any other neurological signs. It is important to search for the aetiological diagnosis for treatment. At the crossroads of several specialties, swallowing disorders are difficult to diagnose and treat. They are frequently underestimated, partly because patients rarely complain. In our case report, the diagnosis was ascertained by the removal of the medication, without functional evidence, probably by a lack of collaboration between the physician and the endoscopist who had not performed any dynamic investigation of swallowing. This case illustrates the importance of knowing the different mechanisms underlying dysphagia in psychiatric patients, and good communication with gastroenterologists to establish a precise diagnosis of the disorder, and adapt the therapy.",
