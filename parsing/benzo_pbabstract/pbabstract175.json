An imbalance between mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and scavenging was previously implicated in the activation of an inner membrane anion channel (IMAC), distinct from the permeability transition pore (PTP), as the first response to metabolic stress in cardiomyocytes. The glutathione redox couple, GSH/GSSG, oscillated in parallel with DeltaPsi(m) and the NADH/NAD(+) redox state. Here we show that depletion of reduced glutathione is an alternative trigger of synchronized mitochondrial oscillation in cardiomyocytes and that intermediate GSH/GSSG ratios cause reversible DeltaPsi(m) depolarization, although irreversible PTP activation is induced by extensive thiol oxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction in response to diamide occurred in stages, progressing from oscillations in DeltaPsi(m) to sustained depolarization, in association with depletion of GSH. Mitochondrial oscillations were abrogated by 4'-chlorodiazepam, an IMAC inhibitor, whereas cyclosporin A was ineffective. In saponin-permeabilized cardiomyocytes, the thiol redox status was systematically clamped at GSH/GSSG ratios ranging from 300:1 to 20:1. At ratios of 150:1-100:1, DeltaPsi(m) depolarized reversibly, and a matrix-localized fluorescent marker was retained; however, decreasing the GSH/GSSG to 50:1 irreversibly depolarized DeltaPsi(m) and induced maximal rates of reactive oxygen species production, NAD(P)H oxidation, and loss of matrix constituents. Mitochondrial GSH sensitivity was altered by inhibiting either GSH uptake, the NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase, or the NADH/NADPH transhydrogenase, indicating that matrix GSH regeneration or replenishment was crucial. The results indicate that GSH/GSSG redox status governs the sequential opening of mitochondrial ion channels (IMAC before PTP) triggered by thiol oxidation in cardiomyocytes.", 
    "1": "Elevated levels of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in glia have been documented in diverse nervous system injuries, while the identity and spatiotemporal characteristics of the cells showing upregulation of PBR remain elusive. We examined the astrocytic and microglial expressions of PBR in rat brains during the duration of ethanol-induced neuronal insults in order to clarify the significance of PBR as a biomarker capable of detecting a distinctive subpopulation of these glial cells involved in the impairment and protection of neurons. The levels of PBR, as determined by autoradiographic analysis using a specific radioligand, [11C]DAA1106, began to significantly increase at 3 days after intrastriatal injection of ethanol, and peaked at 7 days. This was consistent with the results of double immunofluorescence staining and high-resolution emulsion autoradiography, which revealed upregulation of PBR in both microglia and astrocytes proliferating in nonoverlapping compartments of the injury site. Notably, increased expression of PBR in astrocytes was transiently observed in a manner parallel to the centripetal migration of these cells to the inflammatory lesion, which may be a response indispensable to the protection of intact tissue. Thereafter, astrocytic PBR was barely detectable, despite the presence of numerous glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes forming glial scarring. By contrast, intense PBR signals were persistently present in microglia localized to the injury epicenter up to 90 days, notwithstanding a gradual reduction in the number of ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1-positive amoeboid microglia between 7 and 90 days. The long-lasting PBR expression in microglia was finally supported by in vivo positron emission tomography imaging, and suggests that inflammatory tissue damage is potentially expandable unless it is tightly sealed by astrocytic scar. The present findings collectively support the utility of PBR in identifying a unique temporal pattern of astrocytic and microglial activation that conventional glial markers hardly pursue.", 
    "2": "Given that protein malnutrition induces structural, neurochemical and functional changes in the CNS, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of different early periods of protein malnutrition on the behavior and reactivity to diazepam (DZ) in a model of anxiety: the fear-potentiated startle (FPS). Male Wistar rats (n = 110) from well-nourished (16 %-protein) or malnourished (6%-protein) litters were distributed in five different groups: W (well-nourished), M7 (malnourished for 7-days, since day 0), M14 (14-days), M21 (21-days) and M28 (28-days). The results obtained in FPS revealed that malnourished-animals acquired the startle response, irrespective of the time they were exposed to the diet. Besides, DZ reduced the startle amplitude in the noise-alone and light-noise trials. The data concerning the total freezing time showed that the expression of this response was affected by malnutrition and varied in accordance with the findings of previous studies in which malnutrition procedures was imposed for long periods (more than 50 days). Therefore, we suggest that early protein malnutrition: (a) did not produce deficits in the associative learning process of these animals in the FPS, and (b) decreased freezing time in the FPS and produce hyporeactivity to the effects of DZ in rats malnourished for 21 days or more, indicating alterations in the GABAergic neurotransmitter system.", 
    "3": "The behavior of isolation-reared mice has not yet been studied in the staircase test. The present study examined the effects of anxiolytic or anxiogenic agents and isolation rearing on the behavior of ddY (outbred) strain mice in the staircase test. Diazepam and phenobarbital increased the number of steps climbed, but did not affect rearing behavior in group-reared mice. FG-7142, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, significantly increased the number of rearing with no changes in the number of steps climbed in group-reared mice. Methamphetamine increased the number of steps climbed and decreased the number of rearing in group-reared mice. Although isolation-reared mice showed hyperactivity, there was no difference in locomotor activity for the test period of 3 min between isolation- and group-reared mice. Under these conditions, isolation rearing increased the numbers of steps climbed and rearing compared to group-reared controls. Microanalysis of locomotor patterns of group-reared mice in the staircase test showed that anxiolytic drugs increased the number of climbing to the top step of the staircase and methamphetamine increased the number of climbing to the first to third step. These results suggest that isolation rearing causes an anxiety-like state with increased exploratory behavior in mice.", 
    "4": "Involvement of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the regulation of social behavior has been suggested by experiments with mice deficient for the GluR-A subunit-containing AMPA receptors showing reduced intermale aggression. In the present study, effects of AMPA receptor antagonists on mouse social behavior towards unfamiliar Swiss-Webster males on a neutral territory were tested using male subjects from the Turku Aggressive (TA) and Turku Non-Aggressive (TNA) mouse lines bidirectionally selected for high and low levels of offensive aggression. The drugs were the competitive antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX), and the non-competitive antagonist 4-(8-methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepin-5-yl)-benzenamine (GYKI 52466). In TA mice, CNQX and NBQX decreased the biting component of aggressive structure, while GYKI 52466 suppressed all aggressive manifestations. All drugs increased anxiety-like behavior towards the partner. In TNA mice, NBQX activated mouse social behavior and ambivalent aggression, while CNQX and GYKI 52466 only increased anxiety. Thus, AMPA receptor antagonists affect aggressive behaviors in TA mice supporting the idea that AMPA receptors are involved in the modulation of agonistic impulsive behavioral pattern. GYKI 52466 appeared to be the most selective and efficacious in suppressing the aggression.", 
    "5": "It is well established that the most persistent sign of withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepine use in humans is anxiety. In contrast to other types of drugs of abuse, the emergence of this anxiety does not seem to be linked directly to alterations in the levels of dopamine in the mesolimbic system. Some studies have proposed that fear-like behaviors elicited by benzodiazepine withdrawal could be the result either of alterations in the sensitivity of GABAA receptors or in the neuronal hyperexcitability that results from neuroadaptative responses to chronic treatment, probably mediated by glutamate. The increased fear-like behaviors induced by benzodiazepine withdrawal are similar to the defense reaction displayed by animals exposed to dangerous situations or submitted to electrical or chemical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), a key structure of the brain aversive system. However, the involvement of the dPAG in drug abuse has been investigated only in the context of the physical effects of drug dependence. Thus, in this study we investigated the effects of injections into the dPAG of the glutamic acid diethyl ester (GDEE) and 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (AP-7) (AMPA-kainate and NMDA receptors antagonists, respectively) on fear-like behaviors promoted by benzodiazepine withdrawal in rats submitted to aversive events (foot-shocks) immediately before chronic diazepam administration in a conditioning place-preference paradigm, using a light-dark box. Our results showed that inhibition of the glutamatergic neurotransmission in the dPAG reduces the consequence of the diazepam withdrawal in rats, implicating the excitatory amino acids of the dPAG in the modulation of the aversive state induced by benzodiazepine drugs withdrawal.",

Seventy-one (18%) nurses surveyed had administered rectal diazepam gel in a school setting, while 54 (13%) nurses reported that either their state practice act or school district prohibited them from giving rectal medications in the school. Medication administration benefits, such as early intervention for treatment of acute seizure emergencies, were noted. Barriers were also identified, with lack of privacy as the most frequently listed. Scope of practice as it pertains to administering medication in the school and the extent to which delegation of duties can be used in the situation of administering rectal medication in a seizure emergency remain issues for school nurses.",

The ability to respond appropriately to a seizure is of concern to parents and school personnel. Implementation of a seizure emergency treatment plan empowers school personnel to quickly treat the child. Diazepam rectal gel is commonly used in seizure emergency treatment plans. It is safe and effective in terminating seizures and reduces the time to treatment and the need for emergency department visits when used in the school setting, and can be administered by medical and delegated to trained nonmedical personnel.

    "16": "Starting from a novel, achiral 1,3,4-benzotriazepine-based CCK2 receptor antagonist, a process of optimization has afforded further compounds of this type that maintain the nanomolar affinity for recombinant, human CCK2 receptors and high selectivity over CCK1 receptors observed in the initial lead but display more potent inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in vivo. Moreover, this has largely been achieved without altering their potency at wild-type canine and rat receptors, as judged by their displacement of [125I]-BH-CCK-8S in a radioligand binding assay and by their activity in an isolated, perfused rat stomach bioassay, respectively. 2-(5-Cyclohexyl-1-(2-cyclopentyl-2-oxo-ethyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,3,4-benzotriazepin-3-yl)-N-(3-(5-oxo-2,5-dihydro- [1,2,4]oxadiazol-3-yl)-phenyl)-acetamide (47) was identified as the most effective compound stemming from this approach, proving to be a potent inhibitor of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in rats and dogs by intravenous bolus as well as by enteral administration.", 
    "17": "Olanzapine is a widely used second generation antipsychotic drug. Case reports of intoxications have been published, but reports in the literature of non-fatal intoxications of olanzapine containing repeated measurements of serum levels are scarce. Therefore, this case of non-fatal olanzapine intoxication is presented, in which 19 blood samples were drawn during 2 weeks. The highest (initial) measured value was estimated at 800 pg/L. This patient ingested 550 mg of olanzapine resulting in clinical signs of intoxication, including seizures. Because the patient was found the day after the intoxication, the initial concentration had probably been higher. The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine has been described as linear and dose-proportional throughout the therapeutic dosing range. Large overdoses, however, have been described to show non-linear pharmacokinetics. In this study's series of serum concentrations, a two-phase elimination was seen, with an initial elimination half-life of about 24 h during the first 3 days, followed by a second phase with a half-life of about 2.5 days. The patient in this case recovered completely. Because the elimination time after intoxication can be considerably longer than expected, it is recommended that the patient's serum concentrations after intoxication be monitored.", 
    "18": "The present QSAR study has attempted to explore the structural and physicochemical requirements of ligands N,N-dialkyl-2-phenylindol-3-yl-glyoxylamides for binding with peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). The calculated partition coefficient values show parabolic relations with the PBR binding affinity, suggesting that the binding affinity increases with increase in the partition coefficient of the compounds until it reaches the critical value after which the affinity decreases. The critical value of logP is within range of 6.052-6.410. Furthermore, positive Wang-Ford.charge values of carbonyl oxygens of the glyoxamide moiety and negative Wang-Ford charge value of the glyoxamide nitrogen are conducive for the binding affinity. Again, the indole moiety should have favorable charge distribution. Higher values of the parameters dipole moment (Dipole) and moment of inertia (I_z) of the ligands are conducive for the binding affinity. The presence of hydrogen atom at R2 and cyclic moiety at R1 and R2 positions are detrimental to the binding affinity.",

Insomnia is a subjective perception of dissatisfaction with the amount and/or quality of sleep. It includes difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or early awakening with inability to fall asleep again. It is associated with complaints of non-restorative sleep and dysfunction of diurnal alertness, energy, cognitive function, behaviour or emotional state, with a decrease in quality of life. The diagnosis is based on clinical and sleep history, physical examination and additional tests, although polysomnography is not routinely indicated. Therapy should include treatment of the underlying causes, cognitive and behavioural measures and drug treatment. Hypnotic therapy can be prescribed from the onset of insomnia and non-benzodiazepine selective agonists of the GABA-A receptor complex are the drugs of first choice. It is recommended that hypnotic treatment be maintained in cases where withdrawal impairs the patient's quality of life and when all other therapeutic measures have failed. Experience suggests that intermittent treatment is better than continuous therapy. The available data do not confirm safety of hypnotics in pregnancy, lactation and childhood insomnia. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in decompensated chronic pulmonary disease but no significant adverse effects on respiratory function have been reported with zolpidem and zopiclone in stable mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in treated obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Data for zaleplon are inconclusive. If the patient recovers subjective control over the sleep process, gradual discontinuation of hypnotic treatment can be considered.", 
    "26": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In contrast to Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), replacement therapy with dopaminergic and cholinergic agents in PSP has been disappointing. The neurochemical basis for this is unclear. Our objective was to measure dopaminergic and cholinergic receptors in the basal ganglia of PSP and control brains. We measured, autoradiographically, dopaminergic (dopamine transporter, 125I PE2I and dopamine D2 receptors, 125I epidepride) and cholinergic (nicotinic alpha4beta2 receptors, 125I 5IA85380 and muscarinic M1 receptors, 3H pirenzepine) parameters in the striatum and pallidum of pathologically confirmed PSP cases (n=15) and controls (n=32). In PSP, there was a marked loss of dopamine transporter and nicotinic alpha4beta2 binding in the striatum and pallidum, consistent with loss of nigrostriatal neurones. Striatal D2 receptors were increased in the caudate and muscarinic M1 receptors were unchanged compared with controls. These results do not account for the poor response to dopaminergic and cholinergic replacement therapies in PSP, and suggest relative preservation of postsynaptic striatal projection neurones bearing D2/M1 receptors.",

    "34": "Tsc-22 is a novel tumor suppressor gene that represents a new class of transcription factors that has transcriptional repressor activity. We found Tsc-22 downregulation in livers from B6C3F1 mice following treatment for 2 weeks with carcinogenic doses of the antianxiety drug oxazepam (2500 ppm) or the peroxisome proliferator Wyeth-14,643 (500 ppm) but not with two other carcinogens such as o-nitrotoluene or methyleugenol or three noncarcinogens including p-nitrotoluene, eugenol, or acetaminophen. The expression of Tsc-22 was also repressed in B6C3F1 mouse liver tumors that were induced by several chemicals from 2-year carcinogenicity studies as well as in spontaneous liver tumors. To identify potential Tsc-22 target genes in mouse liver, we transfected small interference RNA (SiRNA) designed to inhibit Tsc-22 into murine liver BNL-CL.2 cells. We selected two potential transcriptional targets of Tsc-22, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45 beta (Gadd45b) and leucine zipper, putative tumor suppressor 2 (Lzts2) to test based on our previous complementary DNA microarray studies, showing that expression of these cancer-associated genes was increased when Tsc-22 was repressed. SiRNA treatment of BNL-CL.2 cells with Tsc-22 oligonucleotides but not nonspecific oligonucleotides decreased RNA and protein expression of Tsc-22 by 80-90%, while expression of Gadd45b gene, but not Lzts2, was increased over time after an initial decrease. Treatment of these cells with oxazepam for 48 h also resulted in decreased Tsc-22 and increased Gadd45b expression. These data provide evidence that Tsc-22 is a suppressor of Gadd45b expression, which may contribute to an early antiapoptotic response.", 
    "35": "Insomnia is an extremely common condition with major social and economic consequences worldwide. Two large epidemiological studies (Morfeo 1 and Morfeo 2) recently performed in Italy provided much-needed novel data on the impact of insomnia in patients whose primary healthcare is provided by general practitioners (GPs). These studies found that insomnia is managed relatively well by GPs in Italy, although diagnosis and treatment can be compromised because of the lack of standardised criteria. Although a number of consensus reports on insomnia have been published, these are mainly highly specific documents that are difficult to implement in general practice. To address this, a consensus group involving 695 GPs and over 60 specialists from the Italian Association of Sleep Medicine was established. The major objectives of the consensus study were to establish basic knowledge for the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia, and to produce guidelines for the management of insomnia by GPs. This is the first time that GPs have been directly involved in producing insomnia guidelines of this type, and this approach reflects their pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of this condition. Participants were carefully selected to ensure adequate representation of sleep specialists and GPs, with the group being headed by a steering committee and an advisory board. Guideline statements were selected following careful literature review and were voted on using formalised consensus procedures. This review describes current views on the diagnosis and management of insomnia from the perspective of the GP. In addition, the results of the consensus study are presented. They include recognition of the following principles: (i) insomnia is a genuine pathology that must be appropriately diagnosed and treated; (ii) when concomitant pathologies are present, additional significance should be given to treatment of insomnia since it can influence prognosis of coexistent disorders; (iii) appropriate treatment should consider the cause of insomnia as well as the characteristics of available pharmacological agents; (iv) with regard to hypnotic drugs, preference should be given to medications with a short half-life in order to limit residual effects; (v) non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are preferred to classic benzodiazepines as they have higher selectivity and present a lower risk of undesirable effects; (vi) tablets are preferable to liquid preparations as they are less likely to lead to dependence and to overdosing by the patient; and (vi) once treatment has been initiated, insomnia patients should be carefully followed up. These statements provide much needed criteria for better management of insomnia by GPs in Italy.", 
    "36": "Gastrin regulates ECL cell histamine release and is a critical determinant of acid secretion. ECL cell secretion and proliferation is inhibited by gastrin antagonists and somatostatin but little is known about the role of dopamine agonists in this process. Since the ECL cell exhibits all three classes of receptor we evaluated and compared the effects of the gastrin receptor antagonist, (YF476), lanreotide (SST agonist) and novel dopaminergic agents (BIM53061 and BIM27A760) on ECL cell histamine secretion and proliferation. Highly enriched (>98%) ECL cell preparations prepared from rat gastric mucosa using a FACS approach were studied. Real-time PCR confirmed presence of the CCK2, SS2 and SS5 and D1 receptors on ECL cells. YF476 inhibited histamine secretion and proliferation with IC(50)s of 1.25 nM and 1.3 x 10(-11) M respectively, values 10-1000x more potent than L365,260. Lanreotide inhibited secretion and proliferation (2.2 nM, 1.9 x 10(-10) M) and increased YF476-inhibited proliferation a further 5-fold. The dopamine agonist, BIM53061, inhibited gastrin-mediated ECL cell secretion and proliferation (17 nM, 6 x 10(-10) M) as did the novel dopamine/somatostatin chimera BIM23A760 (22 nM, 4.9 x 10(-10) M). Our studies demonstrate that the gastrin receptor antagonist, YF476, is the most potent inhibitor of ECL cell histamine secretion and proliferation. Lanreotide, a dopamine agonist and a dopamine/somatostatin chimera inhibited ECL cell function but were 10-1000x less potent than YF476. Agents that selectively target the CCK2 receptor may provide alternative therapeutic strategies for gastrin-mediated gastrointestinal cell secretion and proliferation such as evident in the hypergastrinemic gastric carcinoids associated with low acid states.",

    "42": "Previous studies demonstrate that cholecystokinin type-1 (CCK(1)) and serotonin type-3 (5-HT(3)) dependent pathways are independently involved in intestinal nutrient-induced meal termination. In the current study, we employed selective antagonists to investigate the relative contribution of CCK(1) and 5-HT(3) receptors in mediating the anorexia produced by duodenal infusion of Polycose or Intralipid in rats. Combined administration of 1 mg/kg ondansetron (Ond) and 1 mg/kg devazepide (Dev) reversed 132 mM Polycose-induced suppression to the level of control intake and significantly attenuated 263 mM Polycose-induced suppression greater than either antagonist alone. Similar results were observed when subthreshold doses of Ond (500 microg/kg) and Dev (5 microg/kg) were co-administered prior to 263 mM Polycose infusion. Suppression of intake resulting from 130 mM Intralipid was reversed to the level of control when Ond and Dev were co-administered at both independent effective doses (1 mg/kg each) and subthreshold doses (500 microg/kg and 5 microg/kg, respectively). Finally, combined administration of the antagonists increased sucrose intakes beyond intakes following control or treatment with either antagonist alone when rats were infused with saline. These data demonstrate that intestinal carbohydrates and lipids inhibit food intake through simultaneous CCK(1) and 5-HT(3) receptor activation and that these receptors appear to completely mediate the Intralipid-induced suppression of intake.", 
    "43": "DC-81, an antitumor antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces species, belongs to pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD), which are potent inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis. We previously reported an efficient synthesis of PBD hybrids linked with indole carboxylates. This is the first demonstration on the mechanism of the anticancer effect of PBD hybrid (IN6CPBD) agent on human melanoma A375 cells. IN6CPBD-treated cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity than DC-81 and displayed several features of apoptosis, including an increase in the sub-G1 population, a significantly increased annexin V binding, a degradation of caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Because degradative changes associated with apoptosis are often preceded by the disruption of mitochondrial function, the assessment of mitochondrial function in IN6CPBD-treated cells is worthy of investigation. Our data revealed that treatment of A375 cells with IN6CPBD resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsimt), a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi), a reduction of ATP synthesis, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and cytochrome c release. Collectively, our studies indicate that IN6CPBD induces apoptosis in A375 cells through a mitochondrial dysfunction pathway, leading to caspase-3 substrate PARP cleavage and subsequent apoptotic cell death.",

Midazolam is the most commonly used drug for continuous sedation of critically ill children. Opioid derivatives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most widely used analgesics in critically ill children. Opioids combined with benzodiazepines, given in continuous infusion, are the drugs of choice in mechanically ventilated children, especially morphine and fentanyl. The use of protocols and monitoring through clinical scores and objective methods (e.g. bispectral index) allow adjusting medication more appropriately, preventing oversedation, undersedation, and the withdrawal syndrome.

    "48": "Weight gain induced by antipsychotics is the second most frequently given reason for noncompliance with pharmacologic therapy; excessive sedative effects rank first, with extrapyramidal side effects ranking third. Frequently, weight gain leads to inconsistent pharmacologic treatment; this exposes patients to the risk of recurrent symptoms. In fact, one of the key contributors to good clinical outcomes in schizophrenic patients is compliance with pharmacologic treatment. The goals of this study were to evaluate weight gain in a group of patients treated with olanzapine, diet modifications, and moderate physical activity and to compare the findings with those from a second group of patients who were given only olanzapine treatment. For 8 wk, investigators followed 2 groups of patients suffering from schizophrenia and hypomania in bipolar disorder, according to the nosographic criteria of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). The first group (A) of 18 patients (9 female, 9 male) affected by manic episodes in bipolar disorder received olanzapine (10-20 mg/d), jogged lightly for 30 min 3 times a week, and complied with a diet that consisted of 500 kcal/d less than usual. The second group (B) of 10 patients (4 female, 6 male) with schizophrenia received only olanzapine (10-20 mg/d). All patients from both groups were weighed at the beginning of the observation period and weekly thereafter for 2 mo. After 2 mo of observation, group A showed a mean weight gain of 1.47 kg, whereas group B exhibited a mean weight gain of 3.5 kg; the difference between the 2 groups was almost 2 kg (P<.005). Group A showed a statistically significant reduction in weight gain compared with group B, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of moderate physical activity and diet therapy in reducing weight gain in atypical antipsychotic treatment. Therefore, patient weight and body mass index must be monitored during the first weeks of antipsychotic treatment, with the goals of avoiding significant weight gain and treatment interruption.", 
    "49": "In drug discovery today, drug exposure is determined in preclinical efficacy and safety studies and drug effects are related to measured concentrations rather than to the administered dose. This leads to a strong increase in the number of bioanalytical samples, demanding the development of higher throughput methods to cope with the increased workload. Here, a combined approach is described for the high-throughput preparation and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of drug levels in plasma samples from the preclinical efficacy and safety studies, i.e. exposure studies. Appropriate pharmacokinetic (PK) compartmental models were fitted to data from PK screening studies in the rat, which were subsequently used to simulate the expected plasma concentrations of the respective exposure studies. Information on the estimated drug concentrations was used to dilute the samples to appropriate concentration levels. A Tecan Genesis RSP liquid handling system was utilized to perform automated plasma sample preparation including serial dilution of standard solutions, dilution of plasma samples, addition of internal standard solution and precipitation with acetonitrile. This robotic sample preparation process permitted two studies of 1-96 samples each to be run simultaneously. To ensure the performance of this method the accuracy and precision for diazepam were examined. Two novel drugs were used to illustrate the suggested approach. In conclusion, our method for sample preparation of exposure samples, based on the combined use of PK simulations, a liquid handling system and a fast LC/MS/MS method, increased the throughput more than three times and minimized the errors, while maintaining the required accuracy and precision.",

    "56": "The authors studied the duration of intragastric acid production at 20 mg of pariet in patients with hypergastric gastritis after determination of the individual type of parietal gastric cell reception. The study included 40 patients (12 women and 28 men aged 33.3 +/- 6.7 years). Predominant activity of H2 receptors was detected in 32 patients, while M-cholinoreceptor activity prevailed in six patients; in two patients receptor type was not defined. Latent period (3.1 +/- 0.5 hours), pH(max) (5.4 +/- 0.7), pH24h (3.5 +/- 0.4), pH(stimulated24h) (3.0 +/- 0.7) did not depend on the predominant sensitivity of either receptor type and was significantly higher in patients taking pariet than in patients receiving standard doses of omeprazole (2.2 +/- 0.5 h, 4.0 +/- 0.3, 2.4 +/- 0.3, and 1.2 +/- 0.3, respectively) or lansoprazole (2.2 +/- 0.6, 4.3 +/- 0.6, 2.6 +/- 0.3, and 1.3 +/- 0.3, respectively). The clinical effectiveness of pariet was evaluated in 20 patients (15 men and 5 women aged 51.6 +/- 5.4) after gastric resection, needing antisecretory therapy. Individual reception type was studied. The effects of pirenzepine and ranitidine (or famotidine) given in standard doses at the beginning of the week were studied in patients with predominant H2-hystaminergic, M-cholinergic, or unclear type. After that all patients received pariet 20 mg a day. None of the patients displayed predominant H2 receptor activity. In 14 patients predominant M-cholinoreceptor activity was noted; in six patients receptor type remained unclear. All the patients were administered ranitidine (or famotidine) during one week with no clinical effect. Six patients with unclear reception type were given gastrozepine for one more week, with no effect either. After the beginning of pariet 20 mg a day complaints disappeared in all patients within one or two days. The conclusion is that pariet in a standard dose possesses higher antisecretory effect vs. other proton pump inhibitors, unlike that of H2 histamine blockers, the latter not depending on the individual type of gastric parietal cell reception.", 
    "57": "The acute administration of the noncompetitive glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK 801) is known to increase central dopaminergic activity in rats and to elicit schizophreniform behavior in human. The current study was undertaken to compare the effects of different acute or chronic neuroleptic treatments, on the response of ventral tegmental area dopamine (DA) neurons to MK 801, using the in vivo electrophysiological paradigm in anesthetized preparations. Sprague Dawley male rats were treated, acutely or chronically during 3 weeks, with saline, olanzapine (10 mg/kg), haloperidol (1 mg/kg) or the combination of haloperidol with D-serine (1 mg/kg/300 mg/kg), a gliotransmitter coagonist of the NMDA receptor that has been shown to improve the efficacy of typical neuroleptics. In control animals, the acute administration of MK 801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) increased significantly both the firing and burst activity of DA neurons by 20 and 26%, respectively, the latter effect being partially reversed by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist M 100,907 (0.4 mg/kg, i.v.). The acute preadministration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and olanzapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to prevent or reverse the activatory effect of MK 801 on firing activity. On the other hand, MK 801-induced burst activity, was partially prevented by olanzapine, but not by haloperidol pretreatment. All antipsychotic treatments, when administered chronically, prevent the activatory effect of MK 801 on both firing and burst activity, and occasionally convert the response to MK 801 on burst activity to an inhibitory response, the latter occurring more predominantly in rats treated with the combination haloperidol/D-serine. These results suggest that a chronic antipsychotic regime alters the function of the NMDA receptors that tonically control the firing activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.", 
    "58": "Neonatal seizures are the clinical or subclinical manifestations of epileptic nature during the first 28 days of life.

Clinical research studies also suggest that neonatal seizures, even when they are only electrographic, may cause brain lesion independently from their cause. Multiple experimental investigations using mostly rat models of isolated or repeated induced seizures, have demonstrated that neonatal seizures may alter brain metabolic content, maturation of glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors, future cognitive development and epileptogenic risk, neuroneogenesis, intranuclear penetration of calcium, and neuronal apoptotic activation. On the other hand, some experimental studies suggest that phenobarbital, phenytoin and benzodiazepines may have a negative effect on brain development.",

Analysis 1 looked at data from \"nonsedated\" patients (i.e., patients with scores < 8 [deep sleep] or 9 [unarousable] on the Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale [ACES]). In analysis 2, patients were subdivided into \"higher\" and \"lower\" agitation groups according to a median split on the baseline score for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (PEC) (median = 18). Analysis 3 looked at the patients who received a second injection within the 24-hour study period. In each analysis, the mean change from baseline in PEC scores was re-evaluated.",

Analysis 2 found that aripiprazole IM significantly reduced agitation compared with placebo in patients with bipolar I disorder who had lower baseline agitation (p < 0.01), while patients with bipolar I disorder who had higher baseline agitation showed similarly large PEC decreases with aripiprazole (-9.9) and placebo (-7.9). Patients with schizophrenia showed significant reductions in PEC scores compared with placebo regardless of baseline level of agitation (p < 0.01). Analysis 3 found that a second injection of aripiprazole IM significantly reduced agitation in patients with bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia (p < 0.05); repeated injections were safe and well tolerated.", 
    "64": "Improvements with aripiprazole IM appeared to be specific to core agitation symptoms, as opposed to nonspecific sedation, and to be independent of baseline level of agitation. Furthermore, patients benefited from a repeated aripiprazole injection when clinically warranted. These results address important clinical issues regarding use of aripiprazole IM in treating agitation.", 
    "65": "During ischemia or hypoxia an increase in intracellular cytosolic Ca(2+) induces deleterious events but is also implicated in signaling processes triggered in such conditions. In MDCK cells (distal tubular origin), it was shown that mitochondria confer protection during metabolic inhibition (MI), by buffering the Ca(2+) overload via mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX). To further assess this process in cells of human origin, human cortical renal epithelial cells (proximal tubular origin) were subjected to MI and changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)), Na(+), and ATP concentrations were monitored. MI was accomplished with both antimycin A and 2-deoxyglucose and induced a 3.5-fold increase in [Ca(2+)](i), reaching 136.5 +/- 15.8 nM in the first 3.45 min. Subsequently [Ca(2+)](i) dropped and stabilized to 62.7 +/- 7.3 nM by 30 min. The first phase of the transient increase was La(3+) sensitive, not influenced by diltiazem, and abolished when mitochondria were deenergized with the protonophore carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. The subsequent recovery phase was impaired in a Na(+)-free medium and weakened when the mitochondrial NCX was blocked with 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one (CGP-37157). Thus Ca(2+) entry is likely mediated by store-operated Ca(2+) channels and depends on energized mitochondria, whereas [Ca(2+)](i) recovery relied partially on the activity of mitochondrial NCX. These results indicate a possible mitochondrial-mediated signaling process triggered by MI, support the hypothesis that mitochondrial NCX has an important role in the Ca(2+) clearance, and overall suggest that mitochondria play a preponderant role in the regulation of responses to MI in human renal epithelial cells.", 
    "66": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has long been implicated in the anxiolytic, amnesic, and sedative behavioral effects of alcohol. A large number of studies have investigated the interactions of alcohol with GABA receptors. Many investigators have reported effects of \"high concentrations\" (50-100 mM) of alcohol on GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition, but effects of the \"low concentrations\" (1-30 mM) of alcohol normally associated with mild intoxication have been elusive until recently. A novel form of \"tonic inhibition\" has been described in the central nervous system (CNS) that is generated by the persistent activation of extrasynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA-Rs). These receptors are specific GABAA-R subtypes and distinct from the synaptic subtypes. Tonic inhibition regulates the excitability of individual neurons and the activity and rhythmicity of neural networks. Interestingly, several reports show that tonic inhibition is sensitive to low concentrations of alcohol. The thalamus is a structure that is critically important in the control of sleep and wakefulness. GABAergic inhibition in the thalamus plays a crucial role in the generation of sleep waves. Among the various GABAA-R subunits, the alpha1, alpha4, beta2, and delta subunits are heavily expressed in thalamic relay nuclei. Tonic inhibition has been demonstrated in thalamocortical relay neurons, where it is mediated by alpha4beta2delta GABAA-Rs. These extrasynaptic receptors are highly sensitive to gaboxadol, a novel hypnotic, but insensitive to benzodiazepines. Tonic inhibition is absent in thalamic relay neurons from alpha4 knockout mice, as are the sedative and analgesic effects of gaboxadol. The sedative effects of alcohol can promote sleep. However, alcohol also disrupts the normal sleep pattern and reduces sleep quality. As a result, sleep disturbance caused by alcohol can play a role in the progression of alcoholism. As an important regulator of sleep cycles, inhibition in the thalamus may therefore be involved in both the sedative effects of alcohol and the development of alcoholism. Investigating the effects of alcohol on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA-Rs in the thalamus should help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between alcohol and sleep.", 
    "67": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA-Rs) display a wide variety of subunit combinations. Drugs such as benzodiazepines have shown differential effects based on GABAA-R subunit composition. Actions of alcohols and volatile anesthetics generally do not vary markedly with subunit composition, with low concentrations of ethanol being poor modulators of these receptors. Recent studies showed alpha(4/6)- and delta-containing GABAA-Rs (located extrasynaptically and responsible for tonic currents in selective brain regions) presenting high sensitivity to low concentrations of ethanol, but these results have not been obtained in other laboratories. We carried out additional experiments varying the receptor level of expression, and GABA and ethanol concentration, but no sensitivity to low concentrations of ethanol was detected. We will discuss these results and attempt an analysis of the possible causes for the discrepancies.", 
    "68": "Oleamide (cis-9,10-octadecenoamide) is an endogenous sleep-inducing lipid and prototypic member of a new class of biological signaling molecules identified in recent years. In the present study, the anxiolytic-like effect of oleamide was studied in several experimental models of anxiety in group-housed and socially isolated mice. As the results show, socially isolated mice exhibited an anxiogenic-like profile in the elevated plus-maze test, the light/dark test, and the hole-board test, which could be significantly reversed by oleamide (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.). Moreover, oleamide significantly reduced the anxiety levels in grouped-housed mice. In the isolation-induced aggressive test, oleamide markedly reduced the attacking duration and increased the attacking latency. It is concluded that oleamide has an anxiolytic-like effect in socially isolated or group-housed mice, which suggests that fatty acid amides might be involved in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior in mice.", 
    "69": "Manic symptoms frequently occur in patients with comorbid medical disorders and present a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Manic symptoms may be due to an independent psychiatric illness, may be induced or precipitated by a medical condition, or may result from medication or substance use. The presence of manic symptoms in medically ill patients can lead to misdiagnosis or complicate the management of comorbid medical illness. It is of paramount importance to identify the etiology of the mania and, in particular, differentiate primary from secondary mania. Management of mania in the medically ill should focus on treating the underlying medical condition, medication management (antipsychotic agents, mood stabilizers, and/or benzodiazepines), and psychotherapy (if needed). Selecting appropriate medication for treatment requires basic knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of the medications, their side effect profile, and drug-drug interaction. The majority of deficits accompanying secondary mania resolve with treatment of the underlying cause, and supportive psychopharmacology may be all that is needed, but if symptoms persist, patients may need medications for a longer duration.", 
    "70": "The aim of this study was to investigate which principal human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are affected by artemisinin and to what degree the artemisinin derivatives differ with respect to their respective induction and inhibition capacity. Seventy-five healthy adults were randomized to receive therapeutic oral doses of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, arteether, artemether or artesunate for 5 days (days 1-5). A six-drug cocktail consisting of caffeine, coumarin, mephenytoin, metoprolol, chlorzoxazone and midazolam was administered orally on days -6, 1, 5 and 10 to assess the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A, respectively. Four-hour plasma concentrations of parent drugs and corresponding metabolites and 7-hydroxycoumarin urine concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The 1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam 4-h plasma concentration ratio (CYP3A) was increased on day 5 by artemisinin [2.66-fold (98.75% CI: 2.10-3.36)], artemether [1.54 (1.14-2.09)] and dihydroartemisinin [1.25 (1.06-1.47)] compared with day -6. The S-4'-hydroxymephenytoin/S-mephenytoin ratio (CYP2C19) was increased on day 5 by artemisinin [1.69 (1.47-1.94)] and arteether [1.33 (1.15-1.55)] compared with day -6. The paraxanthine/caffeine ratio (CYP1A2) was decreased on day 1 after administration of artemisinin [0.27 (0.18-0.39)], arteether [0.70 (0.55-0.89)] and dihydroartemisinin [0.73 (0.59-0.90)] compared with day -6. The alpha-hydroxymetoprolol/metoprolol ratio (CYP2D6) was lower on day 1 compared with day -6 in the artemisinin [0.82 (0.70-0.96)] and dihydroartemisinin [0.83 (0.71-0.96)] groups, respectively. In the artemisinin-treated subjects this decrease was followed by a 1.34-fold (1.14-1.58) increase from day 1 to day 5. These results show that intake of artemisinin antimalarials affect the activities of several principal human drug metabolizing CYP450 enzymes. Even though not significant in all treatment groups, changes in the individual metrics were of the same direction for all the artemisinin drugs, suggesting a class effect that needs to be considered in the development of new artemisinin derivatives and combination treatments of malaria.", 
    "71": "Driving a motor vehicle is central to the functional autonomy of patients with psychiatric illnesses. There have been many studies of the deleterious effects of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines, typical antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) on human motor skills; however, in the literature little attention has been paid to how such impairment affects driving ability. Computerised driving simulators offer a laboratory-based method of assessing the effects of specific psychotropic medications on driving abilities, in a standardised, controlled and safe manner. The purpose of the present article is to review research undertaken to-date on the effects of psychotropic medications on computer-simulated driving. A search of various databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo, was conducted. Forty-one articles assessing the impact of psychotropics on computer-simulated driving were identified. The pooled total number of subjects assessed in these simulator studies was 1336 (mean sample size 30.36 [SD 35.8]). The most common outcome measures in the various studies were speed, steering, deviation from lateral position (tracking, lane drifting), reaction time or braking accuracy, driving errors (e.g. errors in turning, coordination, gap acceptance, signalling, following distance) and vehicle collisions. The results of the studies were quite variable; however, the most common drug-related impairments included those of tracking and reaction time. Benzodiazepines and TCAs were most commonly associated with impairment, although the level of impairment was dependent on the population studied, the dose and the time of testing relative to drug administration. Computer-simulated driving provides a useful tool to research psychotropic-related impairment of driving abilities. Limitations of currently available data include the lack of generalisability, standardisation and small sample sizes.", 
    "72": "The objective of this case report is to describe a patient with prolonged alcohol withdrawal requiring massive standing doses of benzodiazepines. The setting is the medical intensive care unit of the Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii. The patient is a 58-year-old alcohol-dependent male presenting with mental status changes and agitation following an uncomplicated cystoprostatectomy, who ultimately required massive doses of benzodiazepines to treat his symptoms effectively. We conclude that symptom-triggered therapy proved ineffective in this case due to inability to achieve adequate frequency of assessments. Ultimately, a lengthy, high-dose, fixed interval benzodiazepine regimen was required. The 5-week period of intensive care illustrated that scheduled doses of benzodiazepines may be required and massive and prolonged doses are sometimes necessary. Adherence to a slow-weaning protocol understood by an interdisciplinary team was critical to this patient's recovery. Additionally, toxicity from the high-dose medication was not observed.",

    "78": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a 18 kDa molecule mainly involved in cholesterol transport through the mitochondrial membrane. In microglia, PBR is expressed from the earliest stages of activation and appears to exert a pro-inflammatory function. This molecule is commonly up-regulated in inflammatory, degenerative, infective and ischaemic lesions of the central nervous system but it has never been reported in glioma-infiltrating microglia. We examined two anaplastic astrocytomas showing minimal contrast-enhancement and therefore little damage of the blood brain barrier to minimise the presence of blood borne macrophages within tumour tissue. The two lesions were studied in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) with the specific PBR ligand [(11)C](R)-PK11195 and the corresponding tumour tissue was investigated with an anti-PBR antibody. Glioma-infiltrating microglia were characterised for molecules involved in antigen presentation and cytotoxic activity. As comparison, PBR was investigated in three brains with multiple sclerosis (MS) and three with Parkinson's disease (PD). The expression profile of four anaplastic astrocytomas was also exploited and results were compared to the profile of eleven samples of normal temporal lobe and nine cases of PD. PET studies showed that [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding was markedly lower in tumours than in the contralateral grey matter. Pathological investigation revealed that glioma-infiltrating microglia failed to express PBR and cytotoxic molecules although some cells still expressed antigen presenting molecules. PBR and cytotoxic molecules were highly represented in MS and PD. Evaluation of microarray datasets confirmed these differences. Our results demonstrated PBR suppression in glioma-infiltrating microglia and suggested that PBR may have a relevant role in modulating the anti-tumour inflammatory response in astrocytic tumours.",

Group F1 received a fentanyl bolus of 0.7 microg/kg before infiltration with local anaesthetics; group F2 received the same bolus plus 0.6 microg/kg fentanyl every 45 minutes. All patients received a midazolam bolus of 0.05 mg/kg plus continuous infusion 0.08 mg/kg per hour.", 
    "81": "High-quality analgesia was obtained in every group, without significant differences between the two fentanyl regimens. Group F2 was associated with lower intraoperative mean blood pressure and SpO2 values compared with group F1. No differences were detected between the two groups in perioperative side effects or postoperative pain.",

    "83": "Melkersson proposed leptin dysregulation as a factor in the olanzapine-induced metabolic dysfunction. Their suggestion was based on the absence of the expected positive correlation between serum leptin levels and the BMI, and the loss of the sex-dependent difference in leptin levels, which are higher in women. Although subsequent studies did not confirm that proposal, few of them assessed basal leptin levels and corrected for body fat percentage. Along with these variables, we added a precise definition of participants out of the expected positive correlation in a large sample of schizophrenia patients. Sixty patients (26 women and 34 men) with severe schizophrenia undergoing chronic hospitalization and conventional antipsychotic treatment were switched to olanzapine (10-20 mg/day). We assessed at baseline, and at weeks 8 and 16 of treatment, the percentage of participants with abnormal correlation (out of the 95% confidence interval in the regression line) between leptin levels and the BMI, and the correlation between leptin and insulin, glucose, the insulin resistance index, c-reactive protein (CRP) and treatment response. Leptin levels were higher in women than in men (P<0.01). The positive correlation between leptin levels, BMI and percentage of fat were preserved. After olanzapine, 3.8% of women and 2.9-5.8% of men were out the 95% confidence interval, and the proportion was similar at baseline. Glucose, insulin, the insulin resistance index and the CRP levels significantly increased after olanzapine. The impact of olanzapine on leptin regulation appears discrete and limited to a small number of participants. Additional studies must clarify the features that render them to metabolic dysregulation.",

Thirty anorexics, 18 restricted and 12 bingeing-purging, underwent a 3-month course of cognitive behavioral therapy, plus at random and double-blinded oral olanzapine (2.5 mg for 1 month, 5 mg for 2 months) in half and oral placebo in the other half of them. BMI, psychopathological aspects (eating disorder inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale, Buss-Durkee Rating Scale, Yale Brown Cornell for Eating Disorders Rating Scale, temperament-character inventory), and homovanillic acid blood concentrations for dopamine secretion, were monitored at baseline and then monthly during the trial. At the end of the trial BMI, total eating disorder inventory, total Yale Brown Cornell for Eating Disorders Rating Scale, Buss-Durkee Rating Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale scores and in olanzapine-treated patients the subitems of eating disorder inventory ineffectiveness and maturity fear, of Buss-Durkee Rating Scale direct aggressiveness, of temperament-characteristic inventory persistence had improved significantly. When stratified for anorexia nervosa subtype, BMI changes were significant among anorexia nervosa bingeing-purging patient, 'depression' (Hamilton Rating Scale) and 'direct aggressiveness' (Buss-Durkee Rating Scale) among anorexia nervosa bingeing-purging patients, 'persistence' (temprerament-characteristic inventory), among anorexics restricted patients, with a trend toward significance for obsessivity-compulsivity (Yale Brown Cornell for Eating Disorders Rating Scale). homovanilic acid blood levels increased significantly in the cognitive behavioral therapy+olanzapine group. No correlations were observed between homovanilic acid concentrations and psychopathological parameters. The pharmacological treatment can significantly improve specific aspects of anorexia nervosa.",

    "86": "A decision analysis model was created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two atypical antipsychotics (risperidone and olanzapine) and haloperidol. Outcome probabilities were determined from published clinical trials. The main dependent variable of interest was to compare the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of the atypical antipsychotic with haloperidol, and also to compare the ICER of olanzapine and risperidone. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for olanzapine and risperidone to determine the effects of altering drug cost, efficacy and re-hospitalization rate on total costs.", 
    "87": "Risperidone and olanzapine were dominant strategies compared with haloperidol (less costly and more effective). Risperidone was also dominant when compared with olanzapine. A one-way sensitivity analysis for efficacy indicated that the efficacy of risperidone would need to decrease by approximately 3% from the base-case in order for olanzapine and risperidone to have equal total costs. In a two-way sensitivity analysis varying both the cost of olanzapine and risperidone, the difference in drug costs between them would have to increase from $2.12 per day to $4.12 per day in order to have equal total costs. In terms of varying re-hospitalization rates, the re-hospitalization rate for risperidone would have to increase from 3% to 33% greater than the re-hospitalization rate for olanzapine in order to have equal total direct costs.", 
    "88": "Based on this decision model, atypical antipsychotics were a dominant strategy over haloperidol primarily because of increased efficacy and lower re-hospitalizations. The ICER indicated that risperidone was dominant over olanzapine because of lower drug costs and increased number of responders, which leads to decreased total costs.", 
    "89": "The author relates the case study of a 38-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type) refractory to multiple medications. This patient had a long history of psychiatric illness and had been hospitalized at least 15 times because of aggression, hostility, and psychosis. Two separate trials of risperidone and olanzapine resulted in adverse effects, including possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Quetiapine, as part of combination therapy, led to substantial reductions in the patient's schizoaffective disorder symptoms and problematic behaviors. The patient tolerated quetiapine and did not experience any adverse effects. Quetiapine may be a suitable treatment option in patients with schizoaffective disorder.",

    "91": "Data on self-harm presentations to general hospitals in Oxford (one hospital), Manchester (three hospitals) and Leeds (two hospitals), collected through monitoring systems in each centre, were analysed for the 18-month period March 2000 to August 2001.", 
    "92": "The findings were based on 7344 persons who presented following 10,498 episodes of self-harm. Gender and age patterns were similar in the three centres, 57.0% of patients being female and two-thirds (62.9%) under 35 years of age. The largest numbers by age groups were 15-19 year-old females and 20-24 year-old males. The female to male ratio decreased with age. Rates of self-harm were higher in Manchester than Oxford or Leeds, in keeping with local suicide rates. The proportion of patients receiving a specialist psychosocial assessment varied between centres and was strongly associated with admission to the general hospital. Approximately 80% of self-harm involved self-poisoning. Overdoses of paracetamol, the most frequent method, were more common in younger age groups, antidepressants in middle age groups, and benzodiazepines and sedatives in older age groups. Alcohol was involved in more than half (54.9%) of assessed episodes. The most common time of presentation to hospital was between 10 pm and 2 am.", 
    "93": "Multicentre monitoring of self-harm in England has demonstrated similar overall patterns of self-harm in Oxford, Manchester and Leeds, with some differences reflecting local suicide rates. Diurnal variation in time of presentation to hospital and the need for assessment of non-admitted patients have implications for service provision.",

    "96": "Patients with PNKD with MR-1 mutations had their attack onset in youth (infancy and early childhood). Typical attacks consisted of a mixture of chorea and dystonia in the limbs, face, and trunk, and typical attack duration lasted from 10 minutes to 1 hour. Caffeine, alcohol, and emotional stress were prominent precipitants. Attacks had a favorable response to benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam and diazepam. Attacks in families without MR-1 mutations were more variable in their age at onset, precipitants, clinical features, and response to medications. Several were induced by persistent exercise.", 
    "97": "Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) should be strictly defined based on age at onset and ability to precipitate attacks with caffeine and alcohol. Patients with this clinical presentation (which is similar to the phenotype initially reported by Mount and Reback) are likely to harbor myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1) gene mutations. Other \"PNKD-like\" families exist, but atypical features suggests that these subjects are clinically distinct from PNKD and do not have MR-1 mutations. Some may represent paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia.",

Selected derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one are poorly water soluble drugs. The aim of this work was to report the properties of diazepam- and nitrazepam-PEG 6000 solid dispersions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the solid dispersions. The effect of PEG 6000 on the dissolution of selected derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one was investigated. The dissolution of diazepam, oxazepam and nitrazepam from its solid dispersions increased in the presence of PEG 6000.", 
    "99": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), the active principle of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), was discovered as a vasoconstrictive, fluid retentive circulating hormone. It was revealed later that there are local RAS in many organs, including the brain. The physiological receptor for Ang II, the AT(1) receptor type, was found to be highly expressed in many tissues and brain areas involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and in the sympathoadrenal system. The production of circulating and local Ang II, and the expression of AT(1) receptors increase during stress. Blockade of peripheral and brain AT(1) receptors with receptor antagonists administered peripherally prevented the hormonal and sympathoadrenal response to isolation stress, the stress-related alterations in cortical CRF(1) and benzodiazepine receptors, part of the GABA(A) complex, and reduced anxiety in rodents. AT(1) receptor blockade prevented the ulcerations of the gastric mucosa produced by cold-restraint stress, by preservation of the gastric blood flow, prevention of the stress-induced inflammatory response of the gastric mucosa, and partial blockade of the sympathoadrenal response to the stress. Our observations demonstrate that Ang II is an important stress hormone, and that blockade of AT(1) receptors could be proposed as a potentially useful therapy for stress-induced disorders.", 
    "100": "Pharmacological concepts tailored to status epilepticus, to epileptogenesis following acquired brain insults, and to ictogenesis in established epilepsy vary considerably and should ideally be directed at those pathophysiological mechanisms that presumably underly these conditions. Currently known important molecular targets include voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system and ionotropic glutamate receptors. Metabotropic glutamate receptors, potassium channels, and neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, glycine, and monoamines are beyond the scope of this review. In status epilepticus, immediate failure of GABAergic inhibition occurs, and administration of benzodiazepines and barbiturates displays the pharmacostrategic mainstay. In epileptogenesis within limbic structures, the most important underlying pathophysiological mechanisms currently discussed are transient loss of inhibition and aberrant mossy fiber sprouting. Both processes may be facilitated by N-methy-D: -aspartat (NMDA) receptor regulation. NMDA antagonists may exhibit antiepileptogenic properties in experimental animals, but reliable data in humans are lacking. In established epilepsy, voltage-gated ion channels and impairment of GABAergic functions contribute to mechanisms facilitating ictogenesis. Blockade of sodium and calcium channels and enhancement of GABAergic inhibition are currently the most important tools to prevent the occurrence of seizures.", 
    "101": "This study compares the speed of onset of action of the extended release (XR) formulation of alprazolam with that of the compressed tablet (CT) formulation in a sample of outpatients with DSM-IV panic disorder. Diary records of hourly antianxiety benefit from a 9-week open label switch study of 30-patients stabilized on alprazolam- CT for 3 weeks and then switched to an equivalent dose of alprazolam-XR, were used to examine the timing and magnitude of clinical benefit on both formulations. The magnitude of benefit at the first hour after the first morning dose was similar for both formulations. The peak benefit, over the hours after the first morning dose, was also similar and 90% of peak benefit that was achieved in the first hour on both formulations. Mean time to peak benefit was similar (1.5 h for alprazolam-CT vs. 1.6 h for alprazolam-XR) and the percent of patients achieving peak benefit in the first hour was also similar. Compared to the CT formulation, alprazolam-XR had a much longer duration of therapeutic action (11.3 +/- 4.2 h vs. 5.1 +/- 1.7 h). The results, which may be related to the biotechnology (and resultant pharmacokinetic profile) of the XR preparation, suggest that alprazolam-XR has value as a \"rescue\" as well as a prophylactic or maintenance treatment in panic disorder. These results must be viewed in the context of the study limitations including its small size, the lack of independence of groups in a switch study, and the limitations of the diary records used.", 
    "102": "Although the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are more likely than the negative symptoms to result in a patient's hospitalization, positive symptoms tend to respond more completely to antipsychotic drugs.When positive symptoms are controlled, residual negative symptoms may remain. If these negative symptoms persist, they can have a considerable impact on a patient's ability to function in society. Current therapies have only a limited effect on negative symptoms. Consequently, broad-spectrum agents that effectively treat both positive and negative symptoms are needed. One obstacle to the regulatory approval of an agent for treating negative symptoms is the difficulty of designing a trial to demonstrate efficacy for these symptoms. Agreeing on a definition of negative symptoms, establishing patient inclusion criteria, and determining how to account for confounding factors represent only a few of the challenges to study design. How these challenges can be met is illustrated in the design of a series of clinical trials to assess the efficacy of asenapine, a psychopharmacologic agent being developed for the treatment of schizophrenia and, in particular, the treatment of negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. These trials, the protocols for which are described in this paper, will not only determine the efficacy of asenapine but will add to our knowledge of patients with predominant, persistent negative symptoms, an understudied and inadequately treated patient population.", 
    "103": "Classical conditioning models of addiction provide keys to understanding the vexing discrepancy between substance abuse patients' desire to abstain when they are in therapy sessions and their tendency to relapse. Experiments using these models demonstrate the power of environmental relapse cues and support clinical approaches, including active exposure, aimed at helping patients recognize and withstand them. Internal cues, including emotions and somatic states such as withdrawal, can trigger urges as powerfully as external cues such as people, places, and things associated with prior abuse. The authors describe a cognitive-behavioral therapy approach that focuses on identifying and actively inducing each patient's high-risk emotions, then helping him or her develop and practice healthy responses. Clinical trials support the approach for patients with panic disorder who have trouble discontinuing benzodiazepines, and early trials suggest it may be useful for patients addicted to other drugs as well.", 
    "104": "Tardive dyskinesia is a serious motor side effect of chronic anti-psychotic therapy. The pathophysiology of this disabling and commonly irreversible movement disorder continues obscure and may be caused due to GABAergic hypofunction or increased oxidative damage and free radical generation. Chronic treatment with typical antipsychotics leads to the development of abnormal hyperkinetic orofacial movements (vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and facial jerking) in rats and is widely accepted as the animal model for tardive dyskinesia. Zolpidem, a GABA-mimetic drug is structurally related to melatonin and has been reported to possess anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effects both in vivo and in vitro. The study was carried out to investigate whether zolpidem can be used in the treatment of typical anti-psychotic-induced orofacial dyskinesia. Chronic haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p. for 21 days) and chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg, i.p. for 21 days) treatment significantly induced orofacial hyperkinetic movements and zolpidem [N, N, 6-trimethyl-2-p-tolyl-imidazo (1, 2-a) pyridine 3-acetamideL-(+)] dose dependently (1, 2, 5 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) reduced these haloperidol and chlorpromazine-induced hyperkinetic orofacial movements. Biochemical analysis revealed that haloperidol and chlorpromazine treatment significantly induced increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in the levels of total nitric oxide levels, non-protein thiols (NPSH) and of anti-oxidant defense enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in the striatum of rat brain. Co-administration of zolpidem (1, 2, 5 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and restored the non-protein thiols and total nitric oxide levels induced by chronic haloperidol and chlorpromazine treatment. It also significantly reversed the haloperidol and chlorpromazine-induced decrease in brain SOD and catalase activity. Neurochemical analysis (Neurotransmitter and their metabolite level estimation) revealed that haloperidol and chlorpromazine significantly decreased the dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin levels in brain homogenates where as it caused a significant increase in the metabolite (VMA and HVA) levels in urine, which were significantly reversed by zolpidem at higher doses. Result of the present study support the therapeutic use of zolpidem in the treatment of typical anti-psychotic-induced orofacial dyskinesia.", 
    "105": "Neurosteroids, such as the progesterone metabolite 3alpha-OH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one (THP or [allo]pregnanolone), function as potent positive modulators of the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) when acutely administered. However, fluctuations in the circulating levels of this steroid at puberty, across endogenous ovarian cycles, during pregnancy or following chronic stress produce periods of prolonged exposure and withdrawal, where changes in GABAR subunit composition may occur as compensatory responses to sustained levels of inhibition. A number of laboratories have demonstrated that both chronic administration of THP as well as its withdrawal transiently increase expression of the alpha4 subunit of the GABAR in several areas of the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in in vitro neuronal systems. Receptors containing this subunit are insensitive to benzodiazepine (BDZ) modulation and display faster deactivation kinetics, which studies suggest underlie hyperexcitability states. Similar increases in alpha4 expression are triggered by withdrawal from other GABA-modulatory compounds, such as ethanol and BDZ, suggesting a common mechanism. Other studies have reported puberty or estrous cycle-associated increases in delta-GABAR, the most sensitive target of these steroids which underlies a tonic inhibitory current. In the studies reported here, the effect of steroids on inhibition, which influence anxiety state and seizure susceptibility, depend not only on the subunit composition of the receptor but also on the direction of Cl(-) current generated by these target receptors. The effect of neurosteroids on GABAR function thus results in behavioral outcomes relevant for pubertal mood swings, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and catamenial epilepsy, which are due to fluctuations in endogenous steroids.", 
    "106": "An elevated plus maze (EPM) test was used to determine if the 5-HT1A, GABAA, and benzodiazepine receptors play a role in the anxiolytic-like effects of a 50% EtOH extract of Cinnamomum cassia (C. cassia) in mice. A single treatment with C. cassia (750 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly increased the number of entries into and the time spent in the open arms of the EPM compared with the controls. A repeated treatment with C. cassia (100 mg/kg, 5 days, p.o.) significantly increased the time spent in the open arms of the EPM. Moreover, WAY 100635, (+)-bicuculline, and flumazenil blocked the effect of C. cassia. However, there were no changes in the locomotor activity and horizontal wire test observed in any group compared with the controls. Taken together, these results show that C. cassia has no adverse effects, such as myorelaxant effects, and might be an effective anxiolytic agent by regulating the serotonergic and GABAergic system.",

    "119": "Modification of glutamatergic synaptic function, a mechanism central to neuronal plasticity, may also mediate long-term drug effects, including dependence and addiction. Benzodiazepine withdrawal results in increased glutamatergic strength, but whether alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) are functionally and structurally remodeled during benzodiazepine withdrawal is uncertain. Whole-cell recordings of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, either acutely dissociated or in hippocampal slices, revealed that AMPAR function was enhanced up to 50% during flurazepam (FZP) withdrawal, without changes in whole-cell channel kinetic properties. Agonist-elicited AMPA currents showed a negative shift in rectification in the presence of spermine, suggesting augmented membrane incorporation of glutamate receptor (GluR) 2-lacking AMPARs. As GluR1-containing AMPARs are critical for activity-dependent alterations in excitatory strength, we sought to determine whether changes in GluR1 subunit distribution in CA1 neurons occurred during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Confocal image analysis revealed that FZP withdrawal promoted GluR1 subunit incorporation into somatic and proximal dendritic membranes of CA1 neurons without GluR2 subunit alterations. Findings of immunoblot studies were consistent with immunofluorescent studies indicating increased GluR1, but not GluR2, subunit protein levels in cytosolic, crude membrane and postsynaptic density-enriched fractions from CA1 minislices. As with long-term potentiation (LTP), the FZP-withdrawal-induced GluR1 incorporation into CA1 neuron membranes may require the GluR1-trafficking protein, synapse-associated protein 97, which was also elevated in membrane-associated fractions. Together, our findings provide evidence that during FZP withdrawal, increased membrane incorporation of GluR1-containing AMPARs and associated up-regulation of AMPAR functions in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons share fundamental similarities with the mechanisms underlying LTP. This implies that glutamatergic neuronal remodeling observed in LTP also subserves physiological adaptations to drug withdrawal.",

In >50% of all human cancers, the tumor suppressor 53 KDa phospho-protein p53 is either mutated or deleted. The discovery that MDM2 (HDM2) negatively regulates p53 and therefore inhibits the tumor-suppressor activity of p53 has instigated numerous drug discovery campaigns aimed at disrupting this protein-protein interaction as a potential cancer therapy. Once regarded as intractable targets disrupted by only large macromolecules, protein-protein interactions (PPI) are now mainstream targets due in large part to the intensive effort applied to the study of p53 and the surprising diversity of small molecules (peptides, natural products, terphenyl and other alpha-helix mimetics, chalcones, piperidines, piperazines, fused indoles, isoindolinones, spiro-oxindoles, cis-imidazolines (nutlins), quinolinol and benzodiazepines) capable of disrupting the p53-HDM2 PPI. In addition, drug discovery researchers have employed a number of screening approaches and technologies to identify SMPPIs of the p53-HDM2 interaction, and these discovery paradigms will be discussed. This review will detail the biology of the p53-MDM2 interaction, the major classes of SMPPIs and key medicinal chemistry and in vitro/in vivo biological data reported through October 2006.",

Chemical restrain may potentially alter the indices although it is required to perform ultrasonography in some patients. The purpose of this study was to describe values for both intrarenal and ocular RI and PI within the same subject in clinically normal dogs sedated with a midazolam and butorphanol combination and evaluate if there are any significant changes between sedated and nonsedated dogs. Fifteen healthy Beagle dogs were studied by Duplex Doppler interrogation in interlobar or arcuate arteries of the kidney and long posterior ciliary artery. Pulse rate and systolic blood pressure were also determined. All measurements were recorded before and after the administration of a sedative combination of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg). Mean comparison tests (paired t-tests or Wilcoxon's rank-sum test) were used to determine if any significant differences existed between right and left renal values or right and left ocular values. A correlation study (Pearson or Spearman) was applied between RI, PI, and systolic pressure, and pulse rate. RI and PI were significantly higher in sedated Beagles than in unsedated Beagles. There was neither correlation between index and systolic blood pressure nor pulse rate. In conclusion, provided that normal RI and PI increase in sedated animals, then reference ranges should be higher when sedated--healthy or ill--animals are evaluated.",

Induced circular dichroism spectra for the binding of diazepam and its 3,3-dimethyl substituted analogues to alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) revealed that opposite to human serum albumin, AGP preferably binds the P-conformers. Accordingly, slightly favoured binding of (R)-enantiomers of 3-alkyl derivatives having P-conformation was found. In case of 3-acyloxy derivatives, however, AGP preferably binds the (S)-enantiomers. Studies with the separated genetic variants of AGP proved similar binding affinities, but markedly different conformation selectivities. For diazepam bound by the F1-S variant, a P/M selectivity of about 2 could be estimated.",

The latter was measured by spectral analysis using the maximum-entropy method to calculate the following: the low frequency component (LF), which reflects both the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, the high frequency component (HF) and entropy, which reflects the cardiac parasympathetic activity, the total power (TP), calculated by the addition of LF and HF, and the LF/HF ratio, which reflects the balance between the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity. Forty patients were randomly allocated to the propofol group and the midazolam-propofol group, and the parameters described above were calculated at baseline (T1), post induction (T2), after tracheal intubation (T3), and 3 min (T4) and 5 min after intubation (T5). Propofol was administered at 2.5 mg.kg(-1) in the propofol group and midazolam at 0.1 mg.kg(-1) followed by propofol at 1.5 mg.kg(-1) in the midazolam-propofol group for anaesthesia induction. Then, propofol was administered at 4-6 mg.kg(-1)propofol for maintenance in both groups. The midazolam-propofol group showed compensated haemodynamic changes, which were related to significant increases in the LF/HF ratio at T2, T4 and T5 (p = 0.011, 0.038 and 0.034). These results suggest that the midazolam-propofol combination yielded compensated modulatory effects on the cardiovascular system, including preserved baroreflex activity.",

Activated microglial cells can cause oligodendrocyte damage and white matter injury by release of inflammatory cytokines and production of excitotoxic metabolites. We hypothesized that exposure to endotoxin in utero leads to microglial activation in the fetal brain that can be monitored in vivo by (11)C-(R)-PK11195 (1-[2-chlorophenyl]-N-methyl-N-[1-methylpropyl]-3-isoquinoline carboxamide)--a positron-emitting ligand that binds peripheral benzodiazepine receptor sites in activated microglia--using small-animal PET.",

In order to determine whether baseline agitation level influences treatment response, the effects of oral aripiprazole in acute patients with schizophrenia experiencing either higher or lower levels of agitation were examined.", 
    "161": "A post hoc analysis of pooled data from the first 4 or 6 weeks of 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled aripiprazole trials was conducted. Patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of acute schizophrenia randomly assigned to treatment with either aripiprazole 10, 15, 20, or 30 mg/day (N = 790) or placebo (N = 397) were divided into groups experiencing higher or lower agitation at baseline. Higher agitation was defined as a baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-Excited Component (PEC) score of > or = 14 and a score of > or = 4 on at least 1 PEC item (excitement, hostility, tension, uncooperativeness, or poor impulse control). Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate PANSS total, Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I), and PEC scores between aripiprazole and placebo within the higher and lower agitation groups.",

    "164": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) coordinate various stress responses. Although the effects of stressors on mPFC and BLA activity have been previously examined, it remains unclear to what extent stressors affect functional interactions between these regions. In vivo electrophysiology in the anesthetized rat was used to examine mPFC and BLA activity simultaneously in response to FG-7142, a benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist that mimics various stress responses, in an attempt to model the effects of stressors on corticolimbic functional connectivity. Extracellular unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings, using multielectrode arrays positioned in mPFC and BLA, were conducted under basal conditions and in response to systemic FG-7142 administration. This drug increased mPFC and BLA unit firing at the lowest dose tested, whereas higher doses of FG-7142 decreased various burst firing parameters in both regions. Moreover, LFP power was attenuated at lower (<1 Hz) and potentiated at higher frequencies in mPFC (1-12 Hz) and BLA (4-8 Hz). Interestingly, FG-7142 diminished synchronized unit firing, both within and between mPFC and BLA. Finally, FG-7142 decreased LFP synchronization between these regions. In a separate group of animals, pretreatment with the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil blocked the changes in burst firing, LFP power and synchronized activity induced by FG-7142, confirming direct benzodiazepine receptor-mediated effects. These results indicate that FG-7142 disrupts corticolimbic network interactions via benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonism. Perturbation of mPFC-BLA functional connectivity induced by FG-7142 may provide a useful model of corticolimbic dysfunction induced by stressors.", 
    "165": "Choline acetyltransferase (ChAt) is extensively distributed throughout the CNS where, by catalyzing acetylcholine synthesis, it participates in modulating wide-ranging cholinergic-dependent functions including cognitive performance, sleep, arousal, movement, and visual information processing. Recently, compelling evidence has mounted implicating ChAt in schizophrenia. In particular, studies have identified significant reductions in ChAt activity in the nucleus accumbens and pontine tegmentum of such patients, which furthermore correlate significantly with measures of cognitive performance in the disorder. Similarly, elevated levels of choline, the acetylcholine precursor, have been identified among patients, implicating altered ChAt activity in these individuals. We sought to investigate the potential contribution of three ChAt gene polymorphisms in schizophrenia, and uncovered evidence for significant association between one of these, rs1880676G/A, and disease susceptibility among Basque individuals (genotypewise chi(2) = 20.7, P = 0.00003; allelewise chi(2) = 10.1, P = 0.002). A similar trend for association with susceptibility was observed for a second SNP, rs3810950G/A, (genotypwise chi(2) = 6.4, P = 0.05; allelewise chi(2) = 3.75, P = 0.05). Evidence was also uncovered for a potential influence of these polymorphisms on olanzapine treatment outcome among Spanish patients (F-statistic = 5.02, P = 0.03; F-statistic = 6.53, P = 0.02 respectively), and on improvements in positive symptoms in the case of rs3810950 (F-statistic = 5.3, P = 0.03) and general psychopathology in the case of rs1880676 and rs3810950 (F-statistic = 5.24, P = 0.03; F-statistic = 5.31, P = 0.03 respectively) during therapy. While more comprehensive studies are warranted to determine the precise contribution of ChAt mediated mechanisms in schizophrenia, our findings tentatively implicate a genetic influence of ChAt in the disorder's susceptibility and treatment.",

This study compared the abuse potential of indiplon, a compound with preferential affinity for GABA(A) receptors containing an alpha(1) subunit, with triazolam in 21 volunteers with histories of drug abuse. Placebo, triazolam (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg), and indiplon (30, 50, and 80 mg) were studied in counterbalanced order under double-blind conditions at two different residential research facilities. Both drugs impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance and produced similar dose-related increases in participant and observer ratings of drug strength. The onset of action of both drugs was rapid (30 min); however, the duration of action of indiplon (3-4 h) was shorter than that of triazolam (4-6 h). The profiles of subjective effects of triazolam and indiplon were similar; however, a maximum of 52% of participants identified indiplon as a benzodiazepine or barbiturate, compared with 81% of participants after 0.75 mg of triazolam. On participantrated subjective effects relevant to sedation, the slope of the triazolam dose-effect curve was significantly steeper than that of indiplon. Neither the largest doses of indiplon and triazolam nor the slope of the indiplon and triazolam dose-effect curves were significantly different from each other on any of the same-day or next-day measures of positive drug effects or next-day measures of reinforcing effects. Together, these data suggest that although the abuse potential of indiplon is not different from that of triazolam at these doses, psychomotor and cognitive impairment after large doses of indiplon might be less.",
