We examined the interaction of several predictors such as gender, severity of illness, attitudes toward medications, side effects, and dose frequency.", 
    "1": "The sample consisted of consecutive randomized and nonrandomized patients who were discharged from an inpatient unit with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder between December 1995 and July 1999. All patients were taking oral antipsychotics and consented to the use of an electronic adherence monitor at discharge. Medications were prescribed by usual care providers, and medication adherence was followed weekly for 3 months. The outcome measure was the medication adherence rate registered in the electronic monitors.", 
    "2": "We found no significant difference in adherence between the combined groups of atypical and conventional antipsychotics. Individual medication analysis found better medication adherence with olanzapine in comparison with risperidone and conventional antipsychotics, but the difference disappeared in the final model controlling for dose frequency. Dose frequency, gender, and akathisia predicted adherence.", 
    "3": "Olanzapine initially appeared to be associated with an adherence advantage over risperidone and conventional antipsychotics, but the apparent advantage may have been due to a usual care dose frequency practice that associated olanzapine more often with once-daily dosing. This study suggests that dose frequency is an important predictor of medication adherence. An important caveat is that these results apply only to short-term adherence.",

Efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness rating scale (CGI-S), inclusive of subscales for positive, negative, depressive, and cognitive symptoms. Tolerability was assessed by adverse event questionnaires and weight measurements. Six-month findings are described.", 
    "6": "At baseline, 5833 participants were prescribed monotherapy and the mean severity of illness was moderate to marked (CGI-S). At 6 months, olanzapine resulted in significantly greater improvements in overall, positive, negative, depressive, and cognitive symptoms compared with quetiapine, risperidone or haloperidol (p <.001). Improvements in overall, negative, and cognitive symptoms were significantly higher for risperidone compared with haloperidol (p <.001), whereas improvements across all symptoms were comparable for quetiapine and haloperidol. Extra-pyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia decreased compared with baseline in the olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone groups but increased in the haloperidol group (p <.001, likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms with haloperidol compared with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone).

The great majority of both EMRs and PEMFs report use of physical and chemical restraint in 5% or less of pediatric psychiatric patients. Forty of 47 EMRs and 29 of 32 PEMFs have formal policies on physical restraint use. Far fewer programs have formal policies for chemical restraint (13/33 EMRs and 5/28 PEMFs). A large percentage of both EMRs and PEMFs do not teach their trainees about the application of restraints (EMR = 52%, PEMF = 82%) or the appropriate situations in which to use restraint (EMR = 35%, PEMF = 64%). However, EMRs were more likely than PEMFs to teach about both appropriate restraint application and appropriate situations for their use (RR = 2.6, 1.2-5.8 and RR = 1.8, 1.1-2.9, respectively). The supine position was the position favored by both groups for physical restraint. Therapeutic holding was infrequently used, mostly for younger children. Seventy-two percent of EMRs and 85% of PEMFs used chemical restraint in children. Benzodiazepines and butyrophenones were the most commonly used agents. However, butyrophenones were often misclassified as phenothiazines by both EMRs and PEMFs.",

    "17": "The driving performance is easily impaired as a consequence of the use of alcohol and/or licit and illicit drugs. However, the role of drugs other than alcohol in motor vehicle accidents has not been well established. The objective of this study was to estimate the association between psychoactive drug use and motor vehicle accidents requiring hospitalisation. A prospective observational case-control study was conducted in the Tilburg region of The Netherlands from May 2000 to August 2001. Cases were car or van drivers involved in road crashes needing hospitalisation. Demographic and trauma related data was collected from hospital and ambulance records. Urine and/or blood samples were collected on admission. Controls were drivers recruited at random while driving on public roads. Sampling was conducted by researchers, in close collaboration with the Tilburg police, covering different days of the week and times of the day. Respondents were interviewed and asked for a urine sample. If no urine sample could be collected, a blood sample was requested. All blood and urine samples were tested for alcohol and a number of licit and illicit drugs. The main outcome measures were odds ratios (OR) for injury crash associated with single or multiple use of several drugs by drivers. The risk for road trauma was increased for single use of benzodiazepines (adjusted OR 5.1 (95% Cl: 1.8-14.0)) and alcohol (blood alcohol concentrations of 0.50-0.79 g/l, adjusted OR 5.5 (95% Cl: 1.3-23.2) and >or=0.8 g/l, adjusted OR 15.5 (95% Cl: 7.1-33.9)). High relative risks were estimated for drivers using combinations of drugs (adjusted OR 6.1 (95% Cl: 2.6-14.1)) and those using a combination of drugs and alcohol (OR 112.2 (95% Cl: 14.1-892)). Increased risks, although not statistically significantly, were assessed for drivers using amphetamines, cocaine, or opiates. No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis. The study concludes that drug use, especially alcohol, benzodiazepines and multiple drug use and drug-alcohol combinations, among vehicle drivers increases the risk for a road trauma accident requiring hospitalisation.", 
    "18": "As a follow-up to our previous study of clozapine, medical records of a state psychiatric hospital were reviewed for patients who were prescribed an atypical antipsychotic. From that sample, demographic and clinical data were obtained for individuals with an initial score of 35 or greater on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and at least two additional successive monthly BPRS ratings. A total of 100 patients met the criteria. Most received either olanzapine (46%) or risperidone (36%), with few administered quetiapine (11%) or clozapine (7%). Most also received adjunctive medications, including conventional antipsychotics, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antiparkinsonian agents. The number of patients whose BPRS total scores decreased by 20% or more from baseline was significantly greater for those who received olanzapine than those who received risperidone. However, there was no difference between the two antipsychotics in the number of patients who maintained that degree of improvement, in the average latency to achieve that decrease (1.67 and 1.47 months, respectively), or the average length of stay (LOS; 332 and 376 days, respectively). These results indicate a modest therapeutic advantage of olanzapine compared to risperidone, and a substantial degree of polypharmacy in the use of atypical antipsychotics. This uncontrolled \"real-world\" evaluation supports data from controlled clinical trials, showing that either risperidone or olanzapine would be a reasonable first choice in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with the decision based on the least adverse side effect profile and economic constraints. When compared to our previous clozapine study, we confirm a slight advantage for the effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of this refractory population.", 
    "19": "The management of insomnia in patients experiencing chronic pain requires careful evaluation, good diagnostic skills, familiarity with cognitive-behavioural interventions and a sound knowledge of pharmacological treatments. Sleep disorders are characterised by a circular interrelationship with chronic pain such that pain leads to sleep disorders and sleep disorders increase the perception of pain. Sleep disorders in individuals with chronic pain remain under-reported, under-diagnosed and under-treated, which may lead--together with the individual's emotional, cognitive and behavioural maladaptive responses--to the frequent development of chronic sleep disorders. The moderately positive relationship between pain severity and sleep complaints, and the specificity of pain-related arousal and mediating variables such as depression, illustrate that insomnia in relation to chronic pain is multifaceted and poorly understood. This may explain the limited success of the available treatments. This article discusses the evaluation of patients with chronic pain and insomnia and the available pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to manage the sleep disorder. Non-pharmacological interventions should not be considered as single interventions, but in association with one another. Some non-pharmacological interventions especially the cognitive and behavioural approaches, can be easily implemented in general practice (e.g. stimulus control, sleep restriction, imagery training and progressive muscle relaxation). Hypnotics are routinely prescribed in the medically ill, regardless of their adverse effects; however, their long-term efficacy is not supported by robust evidence. Antidepressants provide an interesting alternative to hypnotics, since they can improve pain perception as well as sleep disorders in selected patients. Sedative antipsychotics can be considered for sleep disturbances in those patients exhibiting psychotic features, or for those with contraindications to benzodiazepines. Low doses of sedative antipsychotics may improve chronic insomnia in the elderly. However, no intervention is likely to be effective unless a good physician-patient relationship is developed.", 
    "20": "In the present study, the authors examined the effects of diazepam (Valium) on various physical, social, and emotional variables within the framework of a task designed to test risk-taking behavior. Participants received either 10 mg of diazepam or a placebo. After the participants tasted strong-flavored liquids, they were able to engage in a risky behavior (i.e., drinking from a confederate's \"used\" water bottle). Half the participants received additional verbal pressure to drink from the bottle. The authors expected that diazepam would increase health-risk behavior, but the results were inconsistent with that prediction. The second goal of the experiment was to explore diazepam's effects on arousal, mood, social anxiety, and taste. Diazepam users exhibited differences in taste perception and social anxiety, which might in part explain the health-risk results.", 
    "21": "We have reported recently that high-speed normal-phase (NP) HPLC separations of a broad range of organic compounds can be performed on cyano columns using gradients of methanol in hexane-like solvent-ethoxynonafluorobutane (ENFB), available commercially. In this communication, we demonstrate that atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) can be effectively used for detection in such separations. The efficiency of APCI under conditions studied has also been compared to the efficiency of traditional electrospray ionization (ESI) in combination with MS for reversed-phase (RP) HPLC of the same compounds. The compounds included in this study were steroids, benzodiazepines, and other central nervous system-active substances, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, and beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Non-polar compounds were found to respond stronger when APCI-MS technique was used, whereas APCI and ESI ionization efficiencies were comparable when polar substances were studied. The combination of normal-phase HPLC separation conditions with mass spectral detection may expand the range of LC-MS applications traditionally associated with reversed-phase HPLC and ESI-MS detection.",

Fifty-one surgical procedures were performed in 45 patients, in whom ear, nose and throat surgery was the main procedure (64.7 %). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium and was maintained by sevoflurane or isoflurane. Fentanyl was used for early postoperative pain relief. No complications appeared in relation to anesthesia or early pain management except in a 44-year-old AIA woman who had a reaction in the postoperative period after receiving an inappropriate analgesic.", 
    "26": "None of the patients had anesthesia-related allergic problems. Atropine and diazepam in the premedication, propofol and fentanyl during induction, muscle relaxation facilitation by vecuronium, and sevoflurane or isoflurane for maintenance seem to be a safe general anesthetic choice for analgesic intolerant patients with and without asthma.", 
    "27": "Depressive and anxiety disorders appear during the transplant process due to psychological stressors, medications and physiological disturbances. Treatment is necessary to prevent impact on patient compliance, morbidity and mortality. Psychotropic medications provide an effective option, although most are only available as oral formulations. Because of this, they are more susceptible to alterations in pharmacokinetic behaviour arising from organ dysfunction in the pretransplant period. Kinetics are also an issue when considering potential drug-drug interactions before and after transplantation. Prior to transplant, organ dysfunction can change the pharmacokinetic behaviour of some psychotropic agents, requiring adjustment of dosage and schedules. Thoracic or abdominal organ failure may reduce drug absorption through disturbances in intestinal motility, perfusion and function. Cirrhotic patients experience increased drug bioavailability due to portosystemic shunting, and thus dosage is adjusted downward. In contrast, dosage needs to be raised when peripheral oedema expands the drug distribution volume for hydrophilic and protein-bound agents. Drug clearance for most psychotropic medications is dependent upon hepatic metabolism, which is often disrupted by endstage organ disease. Selection of drugs or their dosage may need to be adjusted to lower the risk of drug accumulation. Further adjustments in dosage may be called for when renal failure accompanies thoracic or abdominal organ failure, resulting in further impairment of clearance. Studies regarding the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders in the medically ill are limited in number, but recommendations are possible by review of clinical and pharmacokinetic data. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are well tolerated and efficacious for depression, panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Adjustments in dosage are required when renal or hepatic impairment is present. Among them, citalopram and escitalopram appear to have the least risk of drug-drug interactions. Paroxetine has demonstrated evidence supporting its use with generalised anxiety disorder. Venlafaxine is an alternative option, beneficial in depression, post-traumatic stress and generalised anxiety disorders. Nefazodone may also be considered, but there is some risk of hepatotoxicity and interactions with immunosuppressant drugs. Mirtazapine still needs to be studied further in anxiety disorders, but can be helpful for depression accompanied by anorexia and insomnia. Bupropion is effective in the treatment of depression, but data are sparse about its use in anxiety disorders. Psychostimulants are a unique approach if rapid onset of antidepressant action is desired. Acute or short-term anxiolysis is obtained with benzodiazepines, and selection of particular agents entails consideration of distribution rate, half-life and metabolic route.",

The TEE was evaluated using continuous indirect calorimetry during the first 5 days after admission to the intensive care unit. The serum albumin concentration was determined on admission and on Day 5. The TEE varied from 1560 +/- 240 to 1623 +/- 251 kcal/day.

    "31": "Cardiac dysrhythmias are common in acute intoxications. However, epidemiological data is rare and restricted to specific substances. From 1995 to 2003 (until September) 91 285 inquiries of physicians and paramedics to a poison center regarding acute intoxications were analyzed revealing 9888 patients (10.8%) suffering from disturbances of the cardiac rhythm. In a first step of the explorative data analysis dysrhythmias were graduated into three categories (I: tachycardia/bradycardia; II: arrhythmia/conduction disorder; III: ventricular dysrhythmia/cardiac arrest) and the frequencies of the involved substances were determined. In a second step substances which resulted to be of significant interest were investigated for their specific pattern of dysrhythmias. For category I (n = 8730) predominantly tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, betablockers, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were registered (II: [n = 949] tricyclic antidepressants, digitalis glycosides, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, Ca antagonists; III: [n = 209] tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, sotalol, ethanol, central nervous system stimulants). Tricyclic antidepressants resulted in 23.4% of the reported cases in symptoms of category I (II: 2.3%, III: 0.6%; n = 8535). The highest rates of dysrhythmias were observed for sotalol (I: 34.7%, II: 21.6%, III: 8.0%; n = 176) as compared to the lowest rates found for paracetamol (I: 5.2%, II: 0.3%, III: 0.1%; n = 6429). The present investigation provided a comprehensive clinical overview about the frequency of dysrhythmias and involved substances during acute poisonings in emergency medicine. Furthermore, the specific effects of selected substances concerning dysrhythmias could be determined in view of a clinical database.", 
    "32": "The generation of new cells in the adult mammalian brain may significantly modify pathophysiological processes in neuropsychiatric disorders. We examined the ability of chronic treatment with the antipsychotic drugs (APDs) olanzapine and haloperidol to increase the number and survival of newly generated cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatal complex of adult male rats. Animals were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol for 3 weeks and then injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label mitotic cells. Half of the animals continued on the same APD for two more weeks after BrdU challenge, with the other half receiving vehicle during this period. Olanzapine but not haloperidol significantly increased both the total number and density of BrdU-labeled cells in the PFC and dorsal striatum; no effect was observed in the nucleus accumbens. Continued olanzapine treatment after the BrdU challenge did not increase the survival of newly generated cells. The newly generated cells in the PFC did not express the neuronal marker NeuN. Despite the significant increase in newly generated cells in the PFC of olanzapine-treated rats, the total number of these cells is low, suggesting that the therapeutic effects of atypical APD treatment may not be due to the presence of newly generated cells that have migrated to the cortex.", 
    "33": "Inbred strains of mice, such as BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6ByJ, have been used repeatedly to study genotype-phenotype relations. These strains differ on behavioral measures of fear. In novel environments, for example, BALB/c mice are substantially more neophobic than C57BL/6 animals. The benzodiazepine (BZ)/GABAA receptor system has been proposed as a regulator of behavioral responses to stress, and BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice differ in BZ/GABAA receptor binding. In the present study, we found increased BZ receptor levels in C57BL/6 mice in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala as well as the locus coeruleus using either flunitrazepam (nonselective) or zolpidem (alpha1 subtype selective) as radioligands. Differences in receptor binding were most pronounced in the amygdala and locus coeruleus using [3H]zolpidem. C57BL/6 mice showed increased alpha1 mRNA levels in the locus coeuruleus compared to BALB/c mice. In addition, gamma2 mRNA expression in BALB/c mice was decreased in the central nucleus of the amygdala to levels that were 2-2.5-fold lower than those of C57BL/6 mice. The results of an adoption study revealed that the biological offspring of C57BL/6 mothers fostered after birth to BALB/c dams showed decreased levels of gamma2 mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala in comparison to peers fostered to other C57BL/6 mothers (the reverse was found for the biological offspring of BALB/c mothers). In a step-down exploration paradigm, BALB/cByJ mice crossfostered onto a C57BL/6ByJ dam expressed reduced anxiety responses. However, among C57BL/6ByJ mice, the relatively low levels of anxiety ordinarily evident were not increased when mice of this strain were reared by a BALB/cByJ dam. These preliminary findings suggest that the strain differences in the BZ/GABAA receptor system occur, at least in part, as a function of parental care. Such findings may reflect a mammalian example of an indirect genetic effect mediated by maternal care.", 
    "34": "To develop a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for imaging the 'peripheral benzodiazepine receptor' (PBR) in brain and elucidating the relationship between PBR and brain diseases, four analogues (4-7) of N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (2) were synthesized and evaluated as ligands for PBR. Of these compounds, fluoromethyl (4) and fluoroethyl (5) analogues had similar or higher affinities for PBR than the parent compound 2 (K(i) = 0.16 nM for PBR in rat brain sections). Iodomethyl analogue 6 displayed a moderate affinity, whereas tosyloxyethyl analogue 7 had weak affinity. Radiolabeling was performed for the fluoroalkyl analogues 4 and 5 using fluorine-18 ((18)F, beta(+); 96.7%, T(1/2) = 109.8 min). Ligands [(18)F]4 and [(18)F]5 were respectively synthesized by the alkylation of desmethyl precursor 3 with [(18)F]fluoromethyl iodide ([(18)F]8) and 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl bromide ([(18)F]9). The distribution patterns of [(18)F]4 and [(18)F]5 in mice were consistent with the known distribution of PBR. However, compared with [(18)F]5, [(18)F]4 displayed a high uptake in the bone of mice. The PET image of [(18)F]4 for monkey brain also showed significant radioactivity in the bone, suggesting that this ligand was unstable for in vivo defluorination and was not a useful PET ligand. Ligand [(18)F]5 displayed a high uptake in monkey brain especially in the occipital cortex, a region with richer PBR than the other regions in the brain. The radioactivity level of [(18)F]5 in monkey brain was 1.5 times higher than that of [(11)C]2, and 6 times higher than that of (R)-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[(11)C]methyl,N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline ([(11)C]1). Moreover, the in vivo binding of [(18)F]5 was significantly inhibited by PBR-selective 2 or 1, indicating that the binding of [(18)F]5 in the monkey brain was mainly due to PBR. Metabolite analysis revealed that [(18)F]4 was rapidly metabolized by defluorination to [(18)F]F(-) in the plasma and brain of mice, whereas [(18)F]5 was metabolized by debenzylation to a polar product [(18)F]13 only in the plasma. No radioactive metabolite of [(18)F]5 was detected in the mouse brain. The biological data indicate that [(18)F]5 is a useful PET ligand for PBR and is currently used for imaging PBR in human brain.",

Except for group 4, the bitches were intubated and anaesthesia was maintained with enflurane. The puppies' heart and respiratory rates and their pain, sucking, anogenital, magnum and flexion reflexes were measured as they were removed from the uterus. The puppies' respiratory rate was higher after epidural anaesthesia. In general the puppies' neurological reflexes were most depressed after midazolam/ketamine, followed by thiopentone, propofol and epidural anaesthesia.",

Five of these patients also demonstrated marked miosis. All patients recovered within 48h. One patient with severe poisoning (560 mg) had coma and convulsions. Moderate (and severe) symptoms occurred only at ingested doses above 120 mg. There was a statistically significant association between increasing ingested olanzapine doses and poisoning severity.",

Specifically, we investigated whether a neuronal inhibitory system in the brain mediates functional decoupling of cortical areas. Single-dose lorazepam administration resulted in a widespread increase in the inter-area functional connectivity and an increase in the strength of functional long-range and interhemispheric connections. These results suggest that inhibition can be an efficient mechanism for synchronization of large neuronal populations.",

Data from our previous study were used to calculate the occupancy of striatal D2 receptors by antipsychotic medications required to reduce the occupancy of these receptors by endogenous dopamine to control values. In medication-free patients with schizophrenia, the occupancy of striatal D2 receptors by endogenous dopamine is estimated at 15.8%.

In the present study, over 6 h, we measured the kinetics of a 75 microg oral dose of midazolam, a CYP3A substrate, in 21 healthy subjects genotyped for the MDR13435 C >T and 2677 G >T polymorphism. No statistically significant differences were found in the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters between the three 3435 C >T genotypes (TT, CT and CC group, respectively: Cmax (mean +/- SD: 0.30 +/- 0.08 ng/ml, 0.31 +/- 0.09 ng/ml and 0.31 +/- 0.11 ng/ml; Apparent clearance: 122 +/- 29 l/h, 156 +/- 92 l/h and 111 +/- 35 l/h; t1/2: 1.9 +/- 1.1 h, 1.6 +/- 0.90 h and 1.7 +/- 0.7 h). In addition, the 30-min 1'OH midazolam to midazolam ratio, a marker of CYP3A activity, determined in 74 HIV-positive patients before the introduction of antiretroviral treatment, was not significantly different between the three 3435 C >T genotypes (mean ratio +/- SD: 3.65 +/- 2.24, 4.22 +/- 3.49 and 4.24 +/- 2.03, in the TT, CT and CC groups, respectively).

    "58": "The Alcohol Tolerant (AT) and Alcohol Nontolerant (ANT) rats, selectively bred for ethanol-induced ataxia on the inclined plane at ALKO in Finland, were moved to the University of Colorado in 1998. The selection phenotype was tested on generation 60 animals in Colorado. In week one, ataxia was measured on the inclined plane 30 minutes after an intraperitoneal dose of 2 g/kg 15% w/v ethanol. Differences in ethanol-induced ataxia between the AT and ANT lines at the University of Colorado were similar to those in the original lines in Finland. In week two, ataxia was measured on the inclined plane at 5 and 30 minutes, and tolerance was measured as the time to regain the original angle of sliding. The AT rats rapidly developed tolerance to 2 g/kg ethanol on the inclined plane; tolerance development was significantly slower in the ANT rats. In week three, the animals were tested for the duration of loss of righting reflex (LORR) and blood ethanol concentration at regain of the righting reflex (BECRRR) following a dose of 3.5 g/kg. The AT rats had a significantly higher BECRRR than did the ANT rats, but did not differ in LORR. A separate experiment with previously untreated rats demonstrated that na\u00efve animals of the two lines did not differ in BECRRR or LORR. AT and ANT rats were genotyped for the mutation that occurs in the gene for the alpha6 subunit of the GABAA receptor, a natural mutation that is known to affect benzodiazepine responses. All ANT animals tested carried the mutant allele, whereas some AT families carried the mutation and others were wild type. There was no effect of the mutation in AT rats for any of the phenotypes that were tested. After several generations of brother-sister mating, the AT and ANT lines were more than 90% inbred as determined by genotyping. One AT (wild-type) line and one ANT (mutant) line were selected for breeding an F2 intercross generation of 1200 animals. They were phenotyped for sensitivity and tolerance to ethanol on each of three consecutive weeks. Order of testing had a modest effect on some of the phenotypes: when tested during the third week as compared to weeks one or two, BECRRR was increased, 30-minute sensitivity was increased, and development of acute tolerance was increased. Statistically significant correlations were found between tolerance and sensitivity at both 5 and 30 minutes, and between LORR and BECRRR. The smaller (or absence of) significant correlations between others of the phenotypes indicate(s) that they are most likely controlled by different sets of genes.", 
    "59": "In the present study we examined the effects of 1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA), regarded as a selective and competitive mGluR1 antagonist, in animal models of anxiety. Diazepam (1-10 mg/kg) was used as a reference drug. After intraperitoneal administration, AIDA (0.5-2 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze test in rats; however, in doses up to 8 mg/kg, it was inactive in the four-plate test in mice. AIDA tested at the effective doses in the conflict drinking test changed neither the treshold current nor water intake in rats compared to vehicle treatment. AIDA (in a dose of 4 mg/kg, but not lower) increased the exploratory locomotor activity of rats measured in the open-field test, but it did not disturb rat motor coordination in the rota-rod test. The above results indicate that selective mGluR1 antagonist AIDA induces antianxiety-like effects at a low risk of acute side effects characteristic of benzodiazepines. Further studies are required to identify the sites and the mechanism of action of AIDA.",

The percentage increases in the brain and plasma concentrations of these neuroactive steroids apparent 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand CB 34 (25 mg/kg) have now been shown to be markedly greater in isolated rats than in group-housed controls. The CB 34-induced increase in the abundance of 3alpha,5alpha-TH PROG was more pronounced in the brain than in the plasma of isolated rats. Analysis of [3H]PK 11195 binding to membranes prepared from the cerebral cortex, adrenals, or testis revealed no significant difference in either the maximal number of binding sites for this PBR ligand or its dissociation constant between isolated and group-housed animals. Social isolation also induced a small but significant decrease in the plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Moreover, CB 34 increased the plasma concentration of this hormone to a greater extent in isolated rats than in group-housed animals. The persistent decrease in the concentrations of neuroactive steroids induced by social isolation might thus be due to an adaptive decrease in the activity either of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or of PBRs during the prolonged stress, reflecting a defense mechanism to limit glucocorticoid production. The larger increase in neuroactive steroid concentrations induced by CB 34 and the enhanced pituitary response to this compound in isolated rats indicate that this mild stressor increases the response of PBRs.", 
    "66": "Specific ligands of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) activate pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative signaling pathways. Previously, we found that PBR ligands activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in esophageal cancer cells, and that the activation of p38MAPK contributed to tumor cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Here, we report that PBR ligands also activate the pro-survival MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in esophageal cancer cells, which might compromise the efficacy of PBR ligands. Hence, a combination treatment of PBR ligands and MEK inhibitors, which are emerging as promising anticancer agents, was pursued to determine whether this treatment could lead to enhanced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Using Western blotting we demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to PBR ligands. Apoptosis was investigated by assessment of mitochondrial alterations and caspase-3 activity. Cell cycle arrest was measured by flow cytometric analysis of stained isolated nuclei. The inhibition of MEK/ERK with a pharmacologic inhibitor, 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD 98059), resulted in a synergistic enhancement of PBR-ligand-induced growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Specifity of the pharmacologic inhibitor was confirmed by the use of 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene (U 0126), a second MEK/ERK inhibitor, and 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(methylthio)butadiene (U 0124), a structural analogue of it which does not display any affinity to MEK. Enhanced pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects were observed both in KYSE-140 esophageal squamous cancer and OE-33 adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that this effect was not cell-type specific. In addition, the PBR-mediated overexpression of the stress response gene (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene gadd153) was synergistically enhanced by MEK inhibition. This is the first report of enhanced PBR-ligand-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by simultaneous MEK inhibition, suggesting a new anticancer strategy.", 
    "67": "The chronic diazepam administration in rats has been show from our previous results, to produce an increased synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, this occurs with a concomitant over expression of the mRNA NR1 and NR2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits. MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, impairs both the development of conditioned tolerance to diazepam and the hippocampal long-term potentiation generation. In the present study, we have further investigated the hippocampal glutamatergic transmission in the development of tolerance to diazepam. Our results demonstrate that the development of tolerance to the hypolocomotive effect of diazepam, along with the increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the associated over expression of the mRNA NR1 and NR2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits, were blocked by previous MK-801 administration. We suggest that the participation of hippocampal glutamatergic transmission is relevant to increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity, the latter being a neurobiological mechanism behind the development of the conditioned tolerance to diazepam.",

Selection criteria included good health (ASA I), 2 to 5 years of age, uncooperative behavior, and the need for multiple restorative visits. In a double-blind crossover design, patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral CH (50 mg/kg) and SM midazolam (0.2 mg/kg), or oral CH (50 mg/kg) and SM saline placebo on their first sedation visit. On the second sedation visit, the patient received the opposite drug regimen than the first visit. Nitrous oxide (50%) was used during each sedation visit. Behavior response was rated as quiet (Q), crying (C), movement (M), or struggling (S) every 2.5 minutes through 40 minutes of operative procedures. Sedations were monitored using a capnograph, pulse oximeter, an automated blood pressure cuff, and precordial stethoscope.

    "72": "Antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs induce structural alterations in synaptic terminals and changes in the expression of presynaptic protein genes. Whether there are also changes in corresponding postsynaptic (dendritic) markers has not been determined. We describe the effect of 14-day treatment with typical (haloperidol, chlorpromazine) or atypical (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone) antipsychotics on the expression of two dendritic protein genes, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and spinophilin, using in situ hybridization, in the rat hippocampus, retrosplenial, and occipitoparietal cortices. MAP2 mRNA was increased modestly in the dentate gyrus and retrosplenial cortex by chlorpromazine, risperidone, and olanzapine and in the occipitoparietal cortex by chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and risperidone. None of the antipsychotics affected spinophilin mRNA in any area. Overall, these results show a modulation of MAP2 gene expression, likely reflecting functional or structural changes in the dendritic tree in response to some typical and atypical antipsychotics. The lack of change in spinophilin mRNA suggests that dendritic spines are not affected selectively by the drugs. The data provide further evidence that antipsychotics regulate genes involved in synaptic structure and function. Such actions may underlie their long-term effects on neural plasticity in areas of the brain implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia.",

    "80": "The enhancement of GABA-mediated synaptic transmission underlies the pharmacotherapy of various neurological diseases. GABAA receptors are thus targets for neuroactive drugs, including classical benzodiazepines, mediating their anxiolytic, hypnotic and anticonvulsant effects via the benzodiazepine site (BZS). Based on findings that low intrinsic efficacy and subtype selectivity can greatly improve the specificity of drugs targeting the BZS, recent research has identified possible drug leads with apparently little side effects. In particular, drug leads of natural sources have been identified as promising candidates. This review describes the advances in the design of effective therapeutics targeting the GABAA receptor, focusing on the more recent research on naturally occurring drug leads. This includes discussion on the isolation of neuroactive alkaloids and flavonoids from herbal medicines and their rational development based on structure-activity relationships studies. Interest in the development of effective therapeutics from natural sources is clear and awaits to be seen whether their medicinal potential can be fulfilled.", 
    "81": "Benzodiazepines are advantageous treatments for anxiety disorders because they work quickly. However, benzodiazepines can vary in terms of efficacy across anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines have been found to be a superior treatment in social anxiety disorder. While benzodiazepines are effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, other treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be more effective. Also, research indicates that benzodiazepines may not be effective in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Therefore, physicians need to consider the type of anxiety disorder before prescribing a benzodiazepine as a treatment.", 
    "82": "Panic disorder is a chronic, disabling condition that is often associated with a need for long-term clinical treatment. While a variety of pharmacotherapy options, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and benzodiazepines, are effective in reducing symptoms in the acute phase, a significant number of patients do not fully respond to initial treatment, and a large majority of patients experience relapse after medication discontinuation. Optimal long-term treatment of panic disorder involves attention to adequate medication dosing and adequate duration of treatment to achieve maximum improvement before discontinuing. Recent reports suggest the efficacy of adjunctive pharmacotherapies and combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral therapy to improve treatment response. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effectiveness of these multifaceted treatment strategies among patients suffering from refractory panic disorder.", 
    "83": "As high-potency benzodiazepines, essentially alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam, have been used to treat anxiety disorders for almost 2 decades, most efficacy and safety data appeared several years ago. The release of new formulations of 2 of them, clonazepam and alprazolam, invites review of these broadly effective anxiolytics. Clonazepam has recently become available in a lyophilized wafer that disintegrates when exposed to saliva and enhances ease of administration without altering its pharmacology, as shown by bioequivalence studies. Two U.S. multicenter trials carried out in the 1990s, among others, have provided strong confirmatory evidence for the use of clonazepam in panic disorder. Other recently published data on clonazepam pertain to its use as augmentation therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and in the prevention of recurrences of major depressive disorder. A new, extended-release formulation of alprazolam now allows for once-daily rather than t.i.d. or q.i.d. dosing. With extended release, the blood drug concentrations of alprazolam remain within the therapeutic window for several hours, which should reduce fluctuation in therapeutic effect and curb the clock-watching phenomenon between doses. The literature concerning the use of this new formulation of alprazolam in panic disorder is reviewed.", 
    "84": "Low and medium potency benzodiazepines were initially introduced for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Their therapeutic actions as anxiolytics, sedative hypnotics, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants (with their low toxicity) have led to their use as first-line treatments, and they have become one of the most prescribed classes of drugs. Novel therapeutic uses of benzodiazepines were discovered with the introduction of the high-potency benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam). They were found to be effective in treating panic disorder and panic attacks with or without agoraphobia, as add-on therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorders, and as adjunctive therapy in treating patients with acute mania or acute agitation. High-potency benzodiazepines have replaced low and medium potency benzodiazepines in all benzodiazepine clinical indications due to their greater therapeutic effects and rapid onset of action. Differences in distribution, elimination half-life, and rate of absorption are important considerations when choosing a high-potency benzodiazepine. Typically, a benzodiazepine with long distribution and elimination half-lives is preferred. A maximum dose of 2 mg/day of any of the high-potency benzodiazepines when given for more than 1 week is recommended. Although as a class benzodiazepines act rapidly and are well tolerated, their use presents clinical issues such as dependence, rebound anxiety, memory impairment, and discontinuation syndrome.", 
    "85": "The pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is not clearly understood; therefore, clinical observation, case reports, and case reviews continue to enhance physicians' understanding of disease and treatment mechanisms. At Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), physicians and researchers are guided by the recognition that available approved treatments are a small subset of what is sensible to try in anxiety disorders and have thus chosen to remain open minded and prepared to challenge assumptions about therapeutic agents and to explore new uses, including early work with high-potency benzodiazepines. Clinical trials established alprazolam as efficacious for panic disorder, and the agent was widely prescribed for patients at MGH after its approval. Soon, however, clinical observation suggested a short duration of benefit for a given dose in some patients. In some cases, patients who missed a dose reported rebound worsening. In response to the apparent problematic pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, members of the MGH psychiatry department pursued investigation that ultimately established the antipanic efficacy of clonazepam as well as examined its effectiveness in the treatment of other disorders, such as bipolar disorder and social phobia. The process of exploring new uses of older agents remains a worthy effort while we await newer agents with innovative mechanisms of action.",

Self-reports of substance use were compared with urinalysis results. Seventy-three percent of the participants reported use of two or more substances. Single substance users were primarily alcohol users. Kappa agreement between self-report and urinalysis results was of acceptable concordance (> or = 0.65) except for alcohol (kappa = 0.19). Conditional kappa values were good (> or = 0.85) with exception of opiates (cond. kappa = 0.57). The self-reports were generally reliable among young people seeking treatment.

Thirty-eight insomniacs took part in a 5-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of 2 weeks of administration of temazepam 20 mg on sleep. Outcome measures were actigraphy and daily St Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaires (SMHSQ). Actigraphy was performed using Actiwatch (CNT) and analysed using both the automated Actiwatch sleep analysis software and non-parametric analysis of rest-activity rhythms. The questionnaires were administered as straightforward pencil-and-paper for half of the time and an automated telephoned system for the other half. The experimental paradigm allowed within-subject comparison of traditional and automated data collection, both on and off drug. Actigraphy showed a high degree of inter-subject variability but, nevertheless, some sleep variables (Fragmentation Index, Actual Sleep Time %) showed significant improvement during drug treatment, and Sleep Efficiency and Actual Sleep Time were significantly worsened during the first post-drug week. Nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis showed no significant effect. Subjective data from the SMHSQ showed significant drug effects and there was no significant difference in scores between the automated and pencil-and-paper methods; automated data collection was slightly more acceptable to patients and minimized data entry and management. Effect sizes using within-subject and between-subject comparisons were calculated for the subjective and objective measures to inform future studies",

A multicentre, double-blind, randomized trial was performed to compare amisulpride and olanzapine in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. Adult schizophrenic patients with dominant positive symptomatology received amisulpride (200-800 mg/day) or olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) for 6 months. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score, assessed with a non-inferiority analysis. The evolution of positive and negative symptomatology, depression, social functioning and quality of life were assessed. Safety evaluation included adverse event reporting, neurological status and body weight. The improvement of BPRS score was 32.7% in the amisulpride group and 33.0% in the olanzapine group; thus, the efficacy of amisulpride was not inferior to that of olanzapine. All other secondary efficacy outcome variables evolved to a similar extent in both groups. Adverse event frequency was similar in both groups. Amenorrhoea was encountered only in the amisulpride group (6.2% of patients), whereas elevations of liver transaminases were more frequent in the olanzapine group (17% versus 3.7% of patients). The incidence and mean extent of clinically relevant weight gain were higher in the olanzapine group (35.1% and 3.9 kg) than in the amisulpride group (20.6% and 1.6 kg). The efficacy of amisulpride is not inferior to that of olanzapine in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. The side-effect profile of the two drugs differed.", 
    "93": "A learned avoidance response has been one of the hypotheses proposed to explain the 'one-trial tolerance' (OTT) phenomenon, which represents a drug's loss of anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test in experienced rodents. Based on these facts, if some kind of learning occurs throughout Trial 1, then an impairment of its acquisition would maintain the drug's anxiolytic-like effect on Trial 2. Using male Wistar rats, the present study examined whether scopolamine (SCO; 0.5-1.5 mg/kg), a drug that impairs learning acquisition, given 30 min prior to Trial 1, actually prevents the OTT phenomenon to either the midazolam (MDZ; 0.5 mg/kg) or the memantine (MEM; 8.0 mg/kg) anxiolytic-like effect on the EPM Trial 2 (48 h later). According to the results, both MDZ and MEM increased open-arm exploration (indicating anxiolysis) on Trial 2 only in rats that had been treated previously with 1.5 mg/kg SCO. These results were observed in the absence of change in general exploratory activity. The present findings suggest that SCO impaired the acquisition of the behavioral strategy to cope with the subsequent EPM exposure that supposedly underlies the OTT phenomenon, thereby revealing the anxiolytic-like effects of MDZ and MEM on Trial 2.",

In 80.3% of 71 S\u00e3o Paulo visits, as well as in 47.2% of 36 Recife visits, compounded preparations were prescribed. Four to six active components predominated, but there were prescriptions listing as many as 17 components. All contained anorectic substances and benzodiazepines. Diuretics, thyroid agents, laxatives, medicinal plants, and a variety of other substances were often included. The prescribed doses were frequently above recommended limits, reaching amounts as much as five times the internationally defined standard doses. In some instances two anorectic substances were prescribed simultaneously. Most doctors failed to warn volunteers of the possible occurrence of adverse reactions to the prescribed substances. Furthermore, in the case of all volunteers involved, antiobesity prescriptions would be completely unnecessary, a fact that points to improper medical conduct on the part of doctors. It is concluded that the practice by some Brazilian medical doctors of prescribing manipulation formulas based on anorectic and benzodiazepine drugs is a greater hazard than a benefit to patients.",

A significant correlation was found between the type of benzodiazepine in cases of acute poisoning seen in the emergency department and (1) the benzodiazepines used as apparent from a sample of the population of the province of East Flanders (Spearman r=0.70, P=0.002), (2) benzodiazepine prescriptions made during a period of 7 weeks by 131 general practitioners (r=0.66, P=0.039, (3) the number of packages of the different benzodiazepines sold in Belgium (r=0.69, P=0.001) and (4) the number of packages sold in Belgium (expressed in DDD; r=0.58, P=0.047). This correlation was found despite the differences in age and geographic characteristics of the populations we studied.

Using multivariate logistic regression, the probability of benzodiazepine prescription was found to be closely related to age, gender and employment status, but not with educational level. Prescribed Daily Doses were lower than Defined Daily Doses (DDD) in 77.1% of all anxiolytic prescriptions, but were in agreement with DDD in 90% of hypnotic prescriptions. The duration of treatment recorded in the clinical records was 25+/-21 months, with a range of 1 and 144 months. General Practitioners were responsible for 67% of all benzodiazepine prescription.

Anxiolytics are prescribed in doses which are much lower than those used as DDD and were used only 'at night' in almost half of the cases. This could represent an overlapping of the indications with hypnotics, and explain part of the huge difference in the use of anxiolytics in Spain compared with other figures in Europe. This fact must also be taken into account when making inferences of benzodiazepine use from sales statistics, which are very imprecise measures of drug use.",

Within the group of benzodiazepine users, longer exposure to benzodiazepines as well as a history of different benzodiazepines were associated with a higher risk of chronic morbidity. Duration of episodes of use and daily dose were not found to be significantly associated with chronic disease. A pattern of increased benzodiazepine use showed a higher risk of chronic morbidity compared with benzodiazepine users with a stable use. Moreover, a history of benzodiazepine use was found to predict a sharp increase in chronic morbidity.

    "122": "The effect of kainate, an agonist selective for ionotropic AMPA/kainate type of glutamate receptors, on GABAA receptor subunit expression in cultured mouse cerebellar granule cells was studied using quantitative RT-PCR, ligand binding and electrophysiology. Chronic kainate treatment, without producing excitotoxicity, resulted in preferential, dose- and time-dependent down-regulation of alpha1, alpha6 and beta2 subunit mRNA expression, the expression of beta3, gamma2 and delta subunit mRNAs being less affected. The down-regulation was reversed by DNQX, an AMPA/kainate-selective glutamate receptor antagonist. A 14-day kainate treatment resulted in 46% decrease of total [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to the benzodiazepine sites. Diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was decreased by 89% in accordance with very low amount of alpha6 subunit mRNA present. Diazepam-sensitive [3H]Ro 154513 binding was decreased only by 40%, contrasting >90% decrease in alpha1 subunit mRNA expression. However, this was consistent with lower potentiation of GABA-evoked currents in kainate-treated than control cells by the alpha1-selective benzodiazepine site ligand zolpidem, suggesting compensatory expression of alpha5 (and/or alpha2 or alpha3) subunits producing diazepam-sensitive but zolpidem-insensitive receptor subtypes. In conclusion, chronic kainate treatment of cerebellar granule cells selectively down-regulates oil, alpha6 and beta2 subunits resulting in altered GABAA receptor pharmacology.", 
    "123": "Although the main site of action of diazepam, as with other benzodiazepines, is at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor, the degree to which the beneficial actions of diazepam in organophosphorus (OP) ester pesticide poisoning are mediated through the GABAA receptor has been a matter of controversy. Although in most series of OP intoxications, convulsions have been relatively uncommon, it is probable that convulsions produce long-term sequelae in the central nervous system by causing structural damage. Animal studies have demonstrated that diazepam prevents and treats convulsions produced by OPs and may prevent the late effects caused by damage to the central nervous system induced by such convulsions. Consequently, the use of diazepam is an important part of the treatment regimen of severe OP poisoning as it prevents, or at least reduces the duration of, convulsions. In addition, case reports suggest that diazepam will also ameliorate muscle fasciculation, a subjectively unpleasant feature of OP pesticide poisoning. There are no data, either experimental or clinical, demonstrating any clear effect of diazepam alone on lethality in OP poisoning. In fact, in one study of large animals, diazepam, given alone, increased lethality. In animals experimentally poisoned with OPs, combined treatment with atropine and diazepam significantly lowered lethality compared with atropine treatment alone, indicating a clear beneficial effect. There are numerous case reports of the use of diazepam, generally as an adjunct to other more specific OP antidotes such as atropine and/or pyridinium oximes. Based on this evidence and pharmacodynamic studies in experimental animals, diazepam should be given to patients poisoned with OPs whenever convulsions or pronounced muscle fasciculation are present. In severe poisoning, diazepam administration should be considered even before these complications develop. Although diazepam has a large therapeutic index, there appears to be no place for its routine use in OP poisoning. Diazepam should be given intravenously to patients treated in hospital for OP poisoning, although the intramuscular route is used to administer diazepam outside hospital, such as on the battlefield, when an auto-injector is employed. It should be recognised, however, that absorption by the intramuscular route is poor.", 
    "124": "The Fallopian tubes are sparsely innervated with cholinergic nerve fibers. Acetylcholine is released from these nerves and contracts the smooth muscles of the tubes. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of acetylcholine on the isthmic segment of the Fallopian tubes using selective antagonists in different hormonal settings. We investigated the effects of acetylcholine on the isolated isthmus of Fallopian tubes taken from 83 patients during abdominal hysterectomy with adnexectomy. Twenty-eight patients were in the follicular phase, 36 were in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and 19 patients were in menopause. Selective and non-selective muscarinic and nicotinic receptor antagonists were used. Acetylcholine (1.8-658.6 micro M) produced concentration-dependent tonic contraction of isthmus taken from the patients in the follicular phase, the luteal phase and menopause. The nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (6.5 micro M) and local anesthetic lidocaine (230.8 micro M) did not alter the effect of acetylcholine. While M(1) and M(2)-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists pirenzepine (1.6 micro M) and methoctramine (0.9 micro M) did not show specific effect, atropine (0.01 micro M) and the selective M(3)-receptor antagonist p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pFHHSiD; 0.2 micro M) effectively blocked contractions caused by acetylcholine (maximal pA(2) values 9.74 and 7.54, respectively). The affinity of pFHHSiD for muscarinic receptors was highest in the follicular phase.

    "129": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been used as a sensitive marker to visualize and measure glial cell activation associated with various forms of brain injury and inflammation. Previous studies have shown that increased PBR levels following brain injury are specific to areas expressing activated glial cells. However, the contribution of glial cell types responsible for the increases in PBR levels following brain injury is not well defined. In the present study, we used a murine model of cuprizone-induced demyelination to broaden the application of PBR as a marker of brain injury and to validate the relationship between PBR levels and glial cell types. C57BL/6J mice were maintained on a cuprizone-containing or control diet and sacrificed at specific time points after initiation of treatment. Quantitative autoradiography of the PBR-selective ligand [(3)H]-(R)-PK11195 and [(125)I]-(R)-PK11195 showed that increased PBR levels were associated with the degree of demyelination assessed by Black-Gold histochemistry and activation of glial cells assessed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry for astrocytes and CD11b (Mac-1) for microglia. Our findings indicate that brain PBR levels increased as a function of dose and duration of cuprizone treatment and it was detectable prior to observable demyelination. Increased PBR levels were associated with the degree of demyelination and temporal activation of glial cell types in different anatomical regions. In the corpus striatum, we found a close anatomical correlation between microglial activation and increased PBR levels in demyelinating fibre tracts. In the deep cerebellar nuclei, the temporal increases in PBR paralleled demyelination and microglia and astrocyte activation. On the other hand, in the corpus callosum there was an apparent temporal shift in the increase in PBR levels by different glial cell types from an early and predominantly microglial contribution to a late microglial and astrocytic response. High-resolution emulsion autoradiography of [(3)H]-(R)-PK11195 binding to PBR coupled with GFAP or Mac-1 immunohistochemistry showed that demyelination-induced increases in PBR levels were co-localized to both microglia and astrocytes. These findings support the notion that PBR is a sensitive and specific marker for the in vitro and in vivo visualization and quantification of neuropathological changes in the brain.", 
    "130": "The basolateral amygdala (ABL) is essential for the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines in aversive learning tasks. Because the alpha1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor is critical for these amnestic actions, knowledge of the neuronal localization of this subunit in the ABL should contribute to an understanding of the candidate neuronal mechanisms involved. To examine this question, we used dual-labeling immunohistochemical techniques to study the localization of the alpha1 subunit in the ABL. Our results suggest that the alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is localized primarily in GABAergic interneurons in the ABL at the somal level, although the intense neuropil staining in the lateral nucleus suggests that distal dendrites of pyramidal projection neurons in this nucleus may also contain high levels of the alpha1 subunit. The great majority of alpha1-immunoreactive interneurons also exhibit immunoreactivity for the beta2/3 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons are the main interneuronal subpopulation exhibiting alpha1 immunoreactivity, but some calretinin-positive interneurons also express this subunit. These data suggest that certain subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons in the ABL, especially PV+ cells, receive a robust GABAergic innervation. Because the most likely source of this innervation is intrinsic, these results suggest that PV+ interneurons could constitute an important component of interneuronal networks in the ABL. These networks may be critical for the generation of synchronized rhythmic oscillations involved in consolidation of emotional memories. The activation of alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors in the ABL by benzodiazepines may disrupt rhythmic oscillations critical for memory consolidation.", 
    "131": "We observed variations in the metabolism of diazepam in Wistar rats. We studied these variations carefully, and found that the variations are dimorphic and about 17% of male rats of Wistar strain we examined showed two times higher diazepam metabolic activities in their liver microsomes than the rest of animals at the substrate concentrations less than 5 microM. We classified them as extensive metabolizer (EM) and poor metabolizer (PM) of diazepam. No sex difference was observed in the frequency of appearance of EM. Activities of the primary metabolic pathways of diazepam were examined to elucidate the cause of this polymorphism in male Wistar rats. No significant differences were observed in activities of neither diazepam 3-hydroxylation or N-desmethylation between EM and PM rats, while activity of diazepam p-hydroxylation was markedly (more than 200 times) higher in EM rats, indicating that this reaction is responsible for the polymorphism of diazepam metabolism in Wistar rats. We examined the expression levels of CYP2D1, which was reported to catalyze diazepam p-hydroxylation in Wistar rats to find no differences in the expression levels of CYP2D1 between EM and PM rats. The kinetic study on diazepam metabolism in male Wistar rats revealed that EM rats had markedly higher V(max) and smaller K(m) in diazepam p-hydroxylation than those of PM rats, indicating the presence of high affinity high capacity p-hydroxylase enzyme in EM rats. As a consequence, at low concentrations of diazepam, major pathways of diazepam metabolism were p-hydroxylation and 3-hydroxylation in male EM rats, while in male PM rats, 3-hydroxylation followed by N-desmethylation. Due to this kinetic nature of p-hydroxylase activity, EM rats had markedly higher total CL(int) of diazepam than that of PM rats. Polymorphism in diazepam metabolism in humans is well documented, but this is the first report revealing the presence of the polymorphism in diazepam metabolism in rats. The current results infer polymorphic expression of new diazepam p-hydroxylating enzyme with lower K(m) than CYP2D1 in EM Wistar rats.",

Toxicologists would greatly benefit from a screening method that allows for the simultaneous detection of both groups of substances. A new capillary electrophoresis (CE) method has been developed in the micellar mode to accomplish this separation in under 16 min using a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/sodium tetraborate/boric acid buffer with an acetonitrile organic modifier. Optimization of SDS and organic modifier concentration, along with pH, were performed on a set of standards containing eight benzodiazepines, GHB, gamma-butyrolactone, and the internal standard, sulfanilic acid. The method was shown to have a detection limit of less than 2 microg/ml for five out of eight benzodiazepines with a linear range of 2.5-100 microg/ml. The detection limit for GHB was 32 mg/ml with a linear range to 2500 microg/ml. This method was applied to the rapid analysis of spiked beverages. GHB spiked beverages were monitored after using a series of simple dilutions to determine the effects of time on the drug analysis.

    "134": "The effects of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (betaCCM, an inverse agonists of GABA/benzodiazepine receptors) or physostigmine (a cholinesterase inhibitor) on retrieval processes and relationships with anxiety have been only marginally studied.", 
    "135": "This study investigates in mice the effects of acute betaCCM or physostigmine injections on retrieval of previously acquired discriminations involving distinct contextual cues (serial contextual discrimination; SCD) in a four-hole-board. Animals submitted to SCD were also evaluated for emotional reactivity in an elevated-plus maze.", 
    "136": "Mice were injected before the learning session began with a saline solution. Twenty-four hours later, mice were replaced on the context of the initial acquisition and a single dose of saline or betaCCM (0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg) or physostigmine (0.05 and 1.0 mg/kg) was injected 20 min before testing.", 
    "137": "The highest dose of either betaCCM or physostigmine improved performance of the first discrimination in the SCD task. The higher dose of betaCCM produced anxiety-like reactivity in the plus maze, and scores of \"anxiety\" were significantly correlated with memory scores; in contrast, memory performance of physostigmine-treated subjects were totally independent of emotional reactivity.", 
    "138": "These results show that, as opposed to physostigmine, betaCCM acts on retrieval processes specifically through its emotional component.",

    "141": "Fifty-five male war veterans with psychotic PTSD (DSM-IV criteria) were treated for 6 weeks with olanzapine (n=28) or fluphenazine (n=27) in a 5-10 mg/day dose range, once or twice daily. Patients were evaluated at baseline, and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, using Watson's PTSD scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I), Patient Global Impression Improvement Scale (PGI-I) and Drug Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS).", 
    "142": "At baseline, patient's data (age, duration of combat experience and scores in all measurement instruments) did not differ. After 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, olanzapine was significantly more efficacious than fluphenazine in reducing symptoms in PANSS (negative, general psychopathology subscale, supplementary items), Watson's PTSD (avoidance, increased arousal) subscales, CGI-S, CGI-I, and PGI-I scale. Both treatments affected similarly the symptoms listed in PANSS positive and Watson's trauma re-experiencing subscales. Fluphenazine induced more extrapyramidal symptoms. Prolongation of the treatment for 3 additional weeks did not affect the efficacy of either drug.", 
    "143": "Our data indicate that both fluphenazine and olanzapine were effective for particular symptom profile in psychotic combat-related PTSD. Olanzapine was better than fluphenazine in reducing most of the psychotic and PTSD symptoms, and was better tolerated in psychotic PTSD patients.",

Pain was assessed at baseline and every 15 min thereafter. Patients' and urologist's satisfaction with analgesia and sedation were determined on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (extremely dissatisfied) to 7 (extremely satisfied). Patient's discharge time was also documented.",

    "148": "Long-term GABA(A) receptor alterations occur in hippocampal dentate granule neurons of rats that develop epilepsy after status epilepticus in adulthood. Hippocampal GABA(A) receptor expression undergoes marked reorganization during the postnatal period, however, and the effects of neonatal status epilepticus on subsequent GABA(A) receptor development are unknown. In the current study, we utilize single cell electrophysiology and antisense mRNA amplification to determine the effect of status-epilepticus induced by lithium-pilocarpine in postnatal day 10 rat pups on GABA(A) receptor subunit expression and function in hippocampal dentate granule neurons. We find that rats subjected to lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus at postnatal day 10 show long-term GABA(A) receptor changes including a two-fold increase in alpha1 subunit expression (compared with lithium-injected controls) and enhanced type I benzodiazepine augmentation that are opposite of those seen after status epilepticus in adulthood and may serve to enhance dentate gyrus inhibition. Further, unlike adult rats, postnatal day 10 rats subjected to status epilepticus do not become epileptic. These findings suggest age-dependent differences in the effects of status epilepticus on hippocampal GABA(A) receptors that could contribute to the selective resistance of the immature brain to epileptogenesis.", 
    "149": "Sleep disturbances are almost always present in patients with depression. Though sleep disturbances generally abate with the resolution of depression, some patients continue to report poor sleep. Since a number of studies have demonstrated that insomnia increases the risk of new-onset depression and recurrence of depression, optimal management of insomnia associated with depression becomes an important clinical goal. Antidepressant agents have variable effects on sleep and in fact, some antidepressants seem to worsen sleep in patients with depression. This article reviews various treatment options in the management of patients presenting with insomnia and depression, including single agents, combination strategies and behavioral interventions.", 
    "150": "This paper summarizes a group of presentations and panel discussions on chronic insomnia at the 2001 NCDEU meeting. The presentations and discussions focused on the twin issues of efficacy and concerns of abuse liability with long-term hypnotic therapy. The panel concluded that insomnia may be an epidemiological marker for a variety of difficulties including accidents, increased health care utilization and subsequent development of major depression. Whether or not treatment of insomnia will prevent these long-term problems has not yet been determined. Since the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia. Some participants expressed concern at the lack of data for this practice, particularly the absence of dose-response and tolerance information, and noted that the small amount of efficacy data available is not encouraging. Similarly, there are minimal data to support the use of antihistamines as sleep aids; moreover, their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be under appreciated. The limited data available on nightly long-term usage of the newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, primarily of six-months' duration, suggest an absence of tolerance, but more data for both nightly and non-nightly administration are needed. Insomniacs tend to show therapy-seeking, rather than drug-seeking behavior, and patients without histories of drug abuse are unlikely to self-escalate dosage of currently available hypnotics. There is fairly good agreement on the characteristics of an ideal hypnotic. All currently available agents, while effective and safe, do not achieve this ideal. The next few years are likely to see the appearance of a variety of agents with new and promising mechanisms of action.",

The intravenous anesthesia group was further divided into 9 subgroups of 10 patients treated with different anesthetics of different dosages: propofol (1.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 3 mg/kg), midazolam (0.2 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg), and etomidate (0.15 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg). The intravenous anesthetics were given and upper limb SLSEP was monitored continuously. The inhalation anesthesia group was further divided into enflurane, isoflurane and desflurane subgroups of 20 patients each. The inhalational anesthetics were given at the concentrations corresponding to the end-expiratory concentrations of 0 to 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 MAC. The changes of N(14), N(20) and central conduction time (CCT) were recorded. In addition to SLSEP, EKG, NIBP, SpO(2), P(ET) CO(2) were monitored as well as end-tidal anesthetic concentration. During the experiment SpO(2) was maintained > 95% and P(ET) CO(2) was maintained at the range of 35 - 45 mmHg by mask oxygen or assisted ventilation.", 
    "153": "The intravenous anesthetic propofol significantly decreased N(20) amplitude and produced less effect on the latency of N(14), N(20) and CCT. Midazolam significantly decreased the N(20) amplitude and prolonged the latency of N(20) and CCT. Etomidate significantly increased the N(20) amplitude, and the change did not recover when the patients had opened their eyes 10 minutes after medication. All three inhalational anesthetics significantly decreased the N(20) amplitude and prolonged the N(20) latency and CCT. N(20) amplitude disappeared in some patients treated with enflurane when the end-expiratory concentration was 1.0 MAC, while disappeared in some patients treated with isoflurane and desflurane when the end-expiratory concentration was 1.5 MAC for these 2 drugs.",

Olanzapine was associated with significantly greater weight gain than was risperidone across all measures in both adult and elderly patients.", 
    "158": "These findings support a quantitatively or qualitatively different effect of risperidone and olanzapine on the metabolic changes underlying antipsychotic-associated weight gain. Mechanisms responsible for olanzapine's effect on weight appear to counteract smokers' physiologic bias toward weight loss, an effect not seen among risperidone-treated patients.",

Available but limited data suggest that substance use disorders (especially cannabis use disorders) may also be common in first-episode patients and appear linked to a poor outcome in these patients. Strategies to curtail substance use form an important dimension of the treatment program for both first-episode and chronic patients. We report on rates of co-occurring substance use disorders in patients within their first episode of schizophrenia-related psychosis from a multicenter, international treatment trial of olanzapine vs. haloperidol.",

Patients with SUD were more likely to be men. Those with CUD had a lower age of onset than those without. Patients with SUD had more positive symptoms and fewer negative symptoms than those without SUD, and they had a longer duration of untreated psychosis. The 12-week response data indicated that 27% of patients with SUD were responders compared to 35% of those without SUD. Patients with AUD were less likely to respond to olanzapine than those without AUD.", 
    "162": "These data suggest that first-episode patients are quite likely to have comorbid substance use disorders, and that the presence of these disorders may negatively influence response to antipsychotic medications, both typical and atypical antipsychotics, over the first 12 weeks of treatment.",

No or only very slight recall of the procedure were noted in 86% of 133 procedures. Only in 7% of 132 procedures were the patients able to recollect most of the procedure. No, or only a small amount of pain was recollected in 93% of 131 procedures. The most important complication was a slight decrease in oxygen saturation in 23 procedures. In the second part of the study we compared the effects of sedation with midazolam alone versus the combination of midazolam and fentanyl for the introduction of Tesio catheters. Amnesia, ease of procedure and the recollection of pain were equivalent. Oxygen desaturation occurred significantly less often with the use of midazolam alone.",

    "172": "We determined the effect of the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone on aggression, emotion, feeder control, and eating behavior in high and low aggression female pigeons maintained at 80% of their normal weight and exposed to food competition interactions. Pigeons were divided into pairs by previously ranked high aggression (total time spent in offensive aggression exceeding 60 s/5 min; N=6 pairs) and low aggression females (time spent in offensive aggression less than 10 s/5 min; N=6 pairs). A pigeon in each pair received an s.c. dose of naloxone (1 mg kg(-1) ml saline(-1)) and the other animal received the vehicle. Trials (10 min) were performed 30 min after the naloxone/vehicle administration. The naloxone group of high aggression pigeons showed lower scores of total time spent in offensive aggression (control: 98.6 +/- 12.0; naloxone: 46.8 +/- 6.6 s; P<0.05) and higher scores of time spent in emotional responses (control: 3.5 +/- 0.6; naloxone: 10.8 +/- 2.4 s; P<0.05) than controls. The other behaviors scored, feeder control and eating behavior, were not affected in this group. The naloxone group of low aggression pigeons, however, showed higher scores of offensive aggression than their controls (5.3 +/- 1.3; naloxone: 28.7 +/- 8.0 s; P<0.05). The present results suggest that opiate receptor mechanisms are implicated in offensive aggression responses in high and low aggression pigeons. However, as reported for brain 5-hydroxytryptamine manipulation and GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptor manipulation, the effect of the opiate receptor antagonist on food competition aggression in pigeons was related to their pretreatment level of aggression.", 
    "173": "High rates of psychiatric morbidity have been documented in survivors of gross human rights abuses. Nevertheless, there has been relatively little focus on such patients in the context of primary care medicine. A sample of 134 survivors of gross human rights violations was assessed using a structured interview to determine exposure to violations and psychiatric status. In addition, psychiatric treatment history was probed with an open-ended interview. The study found that of the 95 of 134 (72%) participants who were assessed and found to have a current psychiatric diagnosis, only three were receiving treatment for such a disorder. Many subjects had presented to primary care clinics with somatic symptoms and had been prescribed benzodiazepines. Reasons for not reporting trauma or not seeking treatment included issues revolving around fear and mistrust, privacy and confidentiality, re-experiencing the trauma, and lack of awareness. Misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment of survivors of human rights abuses are likely to pose a significant drain on primary care resources. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important challenges in primary care settings.", 
    "174": "The benzodiazepine midazolam produces a dense anterograde amnesia. Recent findings (see, e.g., Hirshman, Passannante, & Arndt, 2001) have demonstrated that midazolam produces larger impairments on explicit memory tests such as free recall and recognition memory than on implicit memory tests such as perceptual identification and free association. Such findings suggest that midazolam impairs conscious, controlled memory processes. In the present experiments, we used Jacoby's (1991, 1998) process-dissociation procedure to examine this hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that midazolam increases the production of old items on the exclusion task and reduces the production of old items on the inclusion task. Moreover, generation effects, hypothesized to arise from conscious processes, are reduced by midazolam on both tasks. Analyses using both independence and redundancy models of the process-dissociation procedure confirm the conclusion that midazolam impairs conscious memory processes.", 
    "175": "This study demonstrated the analysis of midazolam and its metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with a sonic spray ionization (SSI) interface. The analytical column was a YMC-Pak Pro C18 (50 mm x 2.0 mm i.d.) using 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.8)-methanol (1:1) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min(-1). The drift voltage was 100 V. The sampling aperture was heated at 110 degrees C and the shield temperature was 230 degrees C. The lower limits for the detection of midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were 26.3 and 112.76 pg injected, respectively. The calibration curves for midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were linear in the range of 0.1-5 microg ml(-1). Within-day relative standard deviations was less than 7%. The method was applied to the determination of midazolam in monkey plasma, and the analysis of midazolam and its metabolites in an in vitro study with recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. This method is sufficiently sensitive and useful to elucidate the kinetics of midazolam metabolite formation. We also investigated the effect of propofol on the metabolism of midazolam using recombinant CYP3A4. Propofol competitively inhibited the metabolism of midazolam to 1'-hydroxymidazolam by CYP3A4.", 
    "176": "The use of chiral stationary phases (CSPs) obtained from cholic and deoxycholic acid derivatives in the HPLC resolution of racemic compounds is presented. The CSPs containing arylcarbamoyl derivatives of bile acids show enantiodiscriminating capabilities depending on the electronic character of the aryl substituents: the CSPs obtained starting from heteroderivatized selectors, i.e. bile acid derivatives containing both pi-acidic and pi-basic arylcarbamoyl moieties, show enantiodiscriminating capabilities strongly dependent on the arrangement of the electronically different arylcarbamates on the cholestanic backbone. The CSPs obtained starting from deoxycholic acid derivatives possessing both arylamido and arycarbamoyl substituents show enantiodiscriminating capabilities restricted to the resolution of benzodiazepine derivatives. Again, the enantioresolution properties depend not only on the electronic nature of the aromatic substituents but also on their arrangement on the cholestanic backbone. The comparison among the different families of bile acid based CSPs allows us to find likeness and differences in the enantiorecognition mechanism exhibited by the different chiral selectors.", 
    "177": "Recent observations suggest the existence of trihexyphenidyl abuse linked to its hallucinogenic and euphoric effects. In order to determine the importance of this practice and the characteristics of those involved, a study based on data from the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur and the Corsica health reimbursement system was carried out. Individuals from these regions affiliated to the French health reimbursement system who had a prescription for trihexyphenidyl (Artane, Parkinane) reimbursed between January 1, 2001, and February 15, 2001, were selected. The delivery of prescriptions was monitored over a 9-month period. In total, 3028 subjects were selected. A subgroup comprising 2.1% of subjects with deviant behaviour was identified by factorial analysis and compared with the subgroup without deviant behaviour. The subjects with deviant behaviour were young and mostly male. The dosage of trihexyphenidyl was higher in these subjects (28 mg/day versus 7 mg/day) and a greater proportion used benzodiazepine and high-dose buprenorphine compared with those without deviant behaviour. The number of prescriptions delivered was higher (23.0 versus 7.7) as well the number of different physicians (4.9 versus 1.5) and pharmacies (5.0 versus 1.3) for those subjects with deviant behaviour. This study confirms the abuse and dependence potential associated with trihexyphenidyl use and the need to increase the supervision of this drug.", 
    "178": "Pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has not been fully revealed and there are many factors which may affect its development. Ammonia and changes in GABA-ergic neurotransmission seem to be the most essential of these factors. Hepatic encephalopathy is frequently, though not always, accompanied by elevated blood ammonia level. Due to the changes in permeability of blood-brain barrier the ammonia level in the brain also increases which results in both stimulating and inhibitory neurotransmission disturbances. Ammonia also affects abnormal interaction of metabolic neurones and astrocytes as well as glutamine-serotonin balance. Another essential factor affecting hepatic encephalopathy development are disturbances in GABA-ergic neurotransmission connected with GABAA receptor complex. When the liver is damaged GABA-ergic neurotransmission increases due to a higher GABA level, natural benzodiazepine receptor agonists as well as neurosteroids synthesised in astrocytes. Many studies point to the fact that ammonia and GABA-ergic neurotransmission disturbances interrelate with each other. There is a concept saying that both these factors cause hepatic encephalopathy. Ammonia may indirectly increase GABA-ergic neurotransmission and also inhibit the function of the central nervous system by synergistic activity with benzodiazepine receptor ligands. So far it is not known whether GABA-ergic neurotransmission is affected by ammonia only or by other factors as well.", 
    "179": "Benzodiazepines are among the most prescribed drugs indicated as anxiolytics, hypnotics, myorrelaxants or antiepileptics.

It suggested that the medical orientation was precarious and its quality was not influenced by the patients' educational level, the kind of medical attendance or the specialty of the physician. The main orientation cited was \"don't drink\" (85%), followed by \"don't drive or operate machines\" (46%), while few orientations about the risk to develop dependence on benzodiazepines was observed (31%).", 
    "182": "This suggests that physicians were worried about the alcohol interaction risk, which can be dangerous for the patients. The high number of patients using benzodiazepines continuously for more than one year (61%), the unsuccessfully attempt to stop using BZD (94%) and the poor information about the duration of the treatment (22%) were all related to the low medical worry about dependence on benzodiazepines.", 
    "183": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular parameters during dental procedures: systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, and heart rate. Nineteen healthy normotensive patients (18-56 years of age) received restorative treatment on three maxillary molars. The patients were continuously monitored by a non-invasive automatic monitor for blood pressure and heart rate during the pre-, trans-, and post-operative periods at the following stages: 15 min prior to anesthesia; during topical anesthesia; during infiltrative anesthesia; for 5 minutes immediately after; during cavity preparation; during restorative procedure; for 10 min after completion. Patients were divided into three groups: A (without pre-medication), B (preceded by 10 mg diazepam), and C (preceded by placebo). All patients received infiltrative anesthesia containing 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine (36 mg) with epinephrine 1:100,000 (18 microg). There were no changes in the parameters during the clinical procedures. When groups were compared, there were significant differences in diastolic arterial pressures during anesthesia."
