When the tubes contained disparate concentrations (32% versus 4%), lick-rate was higher for the 32% solution than it was when both tubes contained 32% (a positive contrast effect) and less for 4% than when both tubes contained 4% (a negative contrast effect). Similar, but generally less pronounced, contrast effects were obtained in latency to initiate drinking. These contrast effects showed no sign of diminution with repeated exposure (32 days of repeated shifts in Experiments 1 and 3); they were not greatly influenced by injections of imipramine (Experiment 2) or chlordiazepoxide (Experiment 3), nor by deprivation conditions (Experiment 3), nor by deprivation conditions (Experiment 3). The results supported an explanation of simultaneous contrast in terms of sensory-perceptual processes rather than in terms of generalization decrement or emotional responses.", 
    "1": "The authors investigated, in 22 normal subjects and 22 bronchopneumopathic patients, the action of two anxiolytic drugs on ventilatory function and on the associated respiratory function. The analyses carried out before drug administration and 1, 2, 6 hours later showed that while a drug did not cause any important variation in the ventilatory parameters and O2 uptake, both in healthy subjects and in patients, the second one clearly reduced the ventilatory efficacy and O2 uptake. This behavior was quite evident 1 and 2 hours after the assumption of the drug while after 6 hours the parameters returned to the initial values. The influence of the circadian rhythm after 6 hours was more evident in both groups after the assumption of the second anxyolitic drug than with the first. Furthermore, evaluation drawn up among the healthy subjects, during simulated driving tests, demonstrated that the second anxyolytic drug provoked a standard depression unevenly distributed like that obtained after the ingestion of a fixed dose of an alcoholic drink.", 
    "2": "We obtained drug histories for the first trimester of pregnancy for 836 mothers of congenitally malformed babies and for an equal number of control mothers of normal babies from the same doctors' practices. There was an association between the use of a hormonal pregnancy test and the subsequent birht of a malformed baby. There was also a greater use of barbiturates by mothers of affected children compared with mothers of control babies, mainly accounted for by treatment of epileptic mothers with phenobarbitone. For all other drugs usage was similar in both sets of mothers.", 
    "3": "Among 302 neonates passively addicted to narcotics, 18 had seizures that were attributed to withdrawal. Of those 18 infants, 10 were among the 127 infants exposed to methadone (7.8%), whereas only one of them was among the 83 infants exposed to heroin (1.2%). Generalized motor seizures and myoclonic jerks were the predominant convulsive manifestations. Paregoric was more effective than was diazepam in controlling and preventing these seizures once they occurred. Electroencephalograms were obtained on 13 neonates in the interictal period; 12 of these ECGs were normal. Three infants, two with myoclonic jerks, had paroxysmal brain wave activity at the time of the seizures.", 
    "4": "Blood samples from deceased narcotic addicts were analyzed for morphine, and the results form persons who died from narcotic addiction were compared with those from homicide victims. In most instances morphine was detectable in both types of death, and usually the values obtained were less than 30 microgram/dl. Narcotic addiction deaths involving only morphine, or morphine plus a combination of ethanol, quinine, or diazepam (Valium), were also evaluated. In some cases high quantities of ethanol were present, and death could be attributed to the combined CNS depressant effects of morphine and ethanol. The quinine levels would not normally be considered toxic, however, and it could not be ascertained that the quantity of this drug present contributed to death. Diazepam was present in elevated concentrations, and its depressant effect may have been a factor in some narcotic addiction deaths.", 
    "5": "The focal involuntary muscular contractions of spinal myoclonus have been associated with neoplastic, infectious, traumatic, and degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Four patients are described here. In two, the myoclonus is associated with severe cervical spondylitis. One patient had herpes zoster. In the fourth, a segment of thoracic spinal cord is narrow and probably atrophic. Both tetrabenazine and clonazepam were therapeutically effective.", 
    "6": "Analogues of bromazepam [7-bromo-1,3-dihydro-5(2-pyridyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, A], which is a clinically useful minor tranquilizer, have been prepared by replacing the 2-pyridyl group at position 5 with 4-pyrimidyl (5), 2-pyrazinyl (8), 2,5-dimethylpyrazin-3-yl (10), and 2-pyrimidyl (12) groups. Low to moderate CNS activities in both mice and cat were found for all the new compounds. For the screening procedures used, the 2-pyrimidyl-substituted derivatives were found to be the most active new analogues although none of the activities exceeded those observed for bromazepam.", 
    "7": "The effect of diazepam on uterine activity was assessed in a series of 30 patients in established spontaneous labor. The action of diazepam on the frequency and amplitude of contractions, uterine tone and fetal heart rate was monitored internally. An i.v. dose of 10 mg diazepam significantly decreased uterine activity by its direct effect on contraction frequency. No effect on uterine tone was seen. This effect of diazepam on contraction frequency was additional to its tranquilizing and muscle relaxant action.", 
    "8": "Three structurally related benzodiazepines were studied as substrates for hydroxylation by liver microsomal enzymes of rats and mice. The Vmax was comparable for dechlorodesmethyldiazepam, desmethyldiazepam, and 2'-chlorodesmethyldiazepam in the two animal species. The apparent Km decreased from dechlorodesmethyldiazepam to 2'-chlorodesmethyldiazepam for liver microsomal enzymes from both animal species. The hydroxylation of desmethyldiazepam and 2'-chlorodesmethyldiazepam yielded two pharmacologically active metabolites, oxazepam and lorazepam, respectively.", 
    "9": "A 22-year-old Japanese male with hyperdynamic beta-adrenergic circulatr without premedication. An abnormal electrocardiographic pattern was observed during the dental treatment, which was analyzed from the standpoint of beta-adrenergic receptors and drugs. During treatment, local anesthetics without adrenergic beta-stimulant would be desirable but premedication with beta blocker may be enough even when anesthetic agents with beta-stimulators are used. Furthermore, premedication with minor tranquilizers is also effective.", 
    "10": "20 mg of medazepam were taken by mouth by 9 healthy volunteers in an acute absorption study. About a 10-fold variation was found during the first 6 hours after the drug in individual serum medazepam, diazepam, and N-desmethyldiazepam levels. In a subacute study 10 mg of medazepam t.i.d. was given to 10 institutionalized mentally subnormal adults with emotional disorders. After 14 days' treatment serum N-desmethyldiazepam levels were generally above 800 ng/ml, 7 to 8 times higher than the serum medazepam or diazepam levels measured 12 hours after the last dose. No correlation was observed between the serum concentration and efficacy of medazepam.", 
    "11": "One hundred-and-eighty-three patients having general anaesthesia for Caesarian section were given lorazepam or diazepam intravenously immediately following delivery. The incidence of unpleasant recall was comparable with the reports of other workers. There was no evidence of a specific retrograde amnesic effect by either drug. Neither agent appeared to affect cardiovascular stability, uterine contraction, the reversal of muscle relaxant or the time to recovery of protective reflexes. The patients tended to be drowsier after lorazepam but as safe as after diazepam so far as circulation, respiration and protective reflexes were concerned.", 
    "12": "Drugs of the benzodiazepine series (clonazepam, lorazepam, diazepam and medazepam) increase the inhibitory processes in the cerebral cortex as it has been shown by means of the recovery cycles of the intracortical response. There is a correlation between the effect on the recovery cycles and their protective action against convulsions induced by GABA deficit. Diazepam enhances the inhibitory effect of GABA applied iontophoretically to rabbit sensorymotor cortex neurons. The drug GABA-ergic effect seems to be specific since it fails to modify the effects of other putative neurotransmitters (glutamate, glycine, acetylcholine). The alteration of rat conflict situation behaviour under diazepam has been eliminated due to the blockade of GABA-receptors by gicuculline and the decrease of the GABA level by thiosemicarbazide. It is inferred that the main effects of benzodiazepines are mediated by GABA and suggested that these agents increase the sensitivity of postsynaptic GABA-ergic receptors.", 
    "13": "Utilizing computerized quantitative analysis of the human scalp recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), it is possible to classify psychotropic drugs. While neuroleptic compounds produce an increase of slow and decrease of fast activities, anxiolytic substances induce an augmentation of fast waves, decrease of alpha waves and--according to the sedative properties of the drug--an increase or decrease of slow waves. Antidepressants produce a concomitant augmentation of slow and fast activities as well as an attenuation of alpha waves. Nootropic substances attenuate slow activities, augment alpha and slow beta waves and decrease fast beta waves. The latter alterations are quite opposite to age-related changes. Since the main psychopharmacological classes seem to have characteristic pharmaco-EEG profiles, the method proved to be useful for determination of psychoactivity and cerebral bioavailability of newly developed substances as for instance AX-A411-BS, a new benzodiazepine. The latter substance was found to be CNS-active and was classified as anxiolytic. It induced dosedependent changes, which were barely visible in the 2nd hour post-drug, became quite obvious in the 4th hour and increased until the 8th hour after oral administration of one single dose. In the higher dosage range, slow activities came to the fore, indicating aoditional sedative properties. Psychometric tests measuring attention, psychomotor activity. mood, vigilance, extroversion, concentration aith a long-lasting effect. The implications of these methods are discussed.", 
    "14": "Lorazepam has been studied as preanaesthetic medication given by mouth, i.m. and i.v. Sediation and side-effects and the incidence of anterograde amnesia in patients having a standard operation under methohexitone-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia were assessed. In a preliminary study of three i.m. (2-, 4- and 8-mg) and six oral (1-,2-,2.5-,4-,5- and 8-mg) doses, the optimum dose was found to be 4 mg for patients with an average weight of 60 kg. This dose was studied in detail when given by all three routes and compared with the commercially available 2.5- and 5-mg tablets. Even when given i.v., there was a delay of 30-40 min in the onset of maximum sedative effect and drowsiness persisted for at least 4 h. Although the onset of action by i.m. injection was slightly faster than when the drug was given by mouth this advantage was more than offset by the high frequencies of pain at the site of injection and restlessness which persisted for 20-40 min. Oral lorazepam in doses of 2.5-5.0 mg was a reliable, effective sedative which could be recommended for routine preanaesthetic medication, provided rapid recovery was not essential. Its soporific effect was accompanied by an appreciable incidence of anterograde amnesia.", 
    "15": "The effects of flunitrazepam and Althesin as anaesthetic induction agents were studied in a double-blind trial in 97 patients undergoing abdominal or gynaecological surgery. There was no difference between the two preparations in respect of the quality of induction. A marked difference in the quality of maintenance of anaesthesia were seen, in favour of flunitrazepam. Recovery was more rapid from Althesin anaesthesia. A low incidence of nausea was observed in both groups.", 
    "16": "A comparative study of the effect of some benzodiazepine deprivatives (chlonazepam, lorazepam, diazepam, and medazepam) on the recovery cycles of the interzonal response was carried out on unanesthetized curare-immobilized cats. These drugs proved to selectively inhibit the testing potential within the range of 20 to 100 msec. between the conditioning and the testing stimuli. This indicates that potentiation of GABA-ergic inhibition in the cerebral cortex. The threshold doses of the drugs inducing the depression of the test response and of ED50, preventing the development of convulsions, caused by GABA deficiency or by GABA-ergic receptor block, were compared; a correlation between the mentioned effects was demonstrated. The significance of GABA-positive effect of benzodiazepines in the mechanism of their anticonvulsive activity is suggested.", 
    "17": "1 The effects of clobazam, a new anxiolytic agent (a 1,5-benzodiazepine) on car-driving ability and other tests of psychomotor performance were investigated in a double-blind, cross-over study v. placebo in normal volunteers. 2 Clobazam (20 mg) or placebo was given nightly for six nights to ten volunteers and subjective ratings of sleep and subjective and objective assessments of behaviour and psychomotor performance on the morning following drug ingestion were recorded. 3 Clobazam significantly improved the subjective ratings of sleep induction and quality of induced sleep. 4 Clobazam did not significantly impair performance in a variety of psychomotor tests and car-driving ability. 5 The validity of the measures used and the relevance of the findings to real life car-driving situations are discussed.", 
    "18": "1 The effect of the 1,5-benzodiazepines, clobazam (10 and 20 mg) and triflubazam (20 and 40 mg), on sleep was studied in six healthy males using electroencephalography for sleep measures and analogue scales for subjective assessments of well being and sleep quality. The effect of clobazam was limited to the night of ingestion. There was some evidence from subjective assessments that the effect of triflubazam may have persisted beyond the night of ingestion. 2 No effect of clobazam or triflubazam was observed on total sleep time, stage shifts in the first 6 h or latency to the first rapid eye movement period of sleep. With clobazam sleep onset latency was shortened (P less than 0.05), but this effect was not seen with triflubazam. The latency to stage 3 was shortened by both drugs. There was evidence of reduced duration of awake (stage 0) activity and drowsy (stage 1) sleep with both drugs. 3 The percentage stage 1 sleep was reduced by clobazam (10 and 20 mg) and by triflubazam (20 mg) (P less than 0.05), though the effect was not significant with triflubazam (40 mg). Clobazam (20 mg) increased the percentage stage 2 sleep (P less than 0.05), but reduced the percentage stage 3 (P less than 0.01) and stages 3 + 4 (P less than 0.05) sleep. There were no other effects on percentage of total sleep time occupied by various sleep stages or in duration (min) of sleep stages, except that the duration (min) of sleep stages, except that the duration (min) of stage 2 sleep in the second 2 h interval of sleep was increased with clobazam (20 mg) (P less than 0.01). 4 Subjects reported impaired sleep with triflubazam (40 mg) (P less than 0.05), and a sense of less wakefulness the morning after ingestion of clobazam (10 and 20 mg) (P less than 0.01) and triflubazam (40 mg) (P less than 0.05).", 
    "19": "In a double blind cross-over study in 40 patients with mild to moderate anxiety, clorazepate 15 mg at bedtime was as effective as diazepam on global rating and slightly superior on target symptom assessment. There was a significantly higher incidence and frequency of side effects during diazepam treatment. Occurrence of side effect related to plasma diazepam, and anxiolytic effect related to plasma nordiazepam. These results are discussed in relation to convenience of the single dose regimen and psychomotor performance.", 
    "20": "Extensive digestion of human serum albumin with trypsin at pH 8.8 yields essentially one main fragment which is resistant to further tryptic degradation. The fragment has been characterized by amino acid analysis, N- and C-terminal analyses, cyanogen bromide digestion, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation and gelfiltration, and circular dichroism measurements. The results indicate that the main fragment consists of the amino acids 182-585. Repeated digestion did not degrade the isolated fragment further. The fragment mainly retains the secondary and tertiary structure of intact human serum albumin as well as its capacity to bind bilirubin and diazepam. The localization of the binding sites for these substances is discussed.", 
    "21": "Administration of 2 mg flunitrazepam (Rohypnol; Roche) to patients before gastro-intestinal endoscopy caused significantly less anxiety and achieved significantly greater sedation than diazepam (Vallium; Roche). No differences were found between any of the trial groups with respect to ease of intubation, tolerance of the procedure, gastric peristalsis, and the state of the pylorus. Memory of the procedure was significantly less vivid in the groups who received 2 mg flunitrazepam, than in the other groups. The patients who received 2 mg flunitrazepam showed a significantly greater willingness to undergo a repeat procedure, both when asked immediately after the procedure, and when asked on the next visit. Pulse rate increased in all groups during the procedure. No change in respiratory rate or in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in any group.", 
    "22": "Diazepam inconcentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) M effectively blocks trains of action potentials (AP) in individual rat diaphragm muscle fibres 'in vitro'. Single APs, evoked and recorded intracellularly with double microelectrodes, were not affected by diazepam. Trains of APs, evoked in diaphragm fibers in a SO42-- -medium (Cl-- -free), were not affected by diazepam. Diazepam decreased the dependence of the membrane resting potential of muscle cells in chloride media on elevated external potassium whereas no effect was observed in SO42-- --Cl-- -free saline. Similar to in the rat diaphragm, diazepam blocked the trains of AP of individual muscle fibres in the frog sartorius muscle (Cl-- -medium). Diazepam did not affect the spontaneous fibrillatory APs recorded extracellularly from rat gastrocnemius muscles 10 days after denervation. Diazepam apparently increases the resting permeability of the muscle fibre memebrane for chloride ions. In the presence of the drug, the higher permeability for Cl- diminishes the depolarization caused by the potassium released and accumulated in the vicinity of the membrane in the course of AP. The muscle fibre membrane thus does not respond by repetitive activity when partially depolarized and only one AP can be evoked when diazepam is present. It is suggested that similar changes in Cl-- permeability may occur in brain excitable structures after diazepam administration and may account for some of the therapeutic effects of the drug.", 
    "23": "Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) was investigated as an intravenous induction agent for dental procedures in 15 patients in a private anaesthetic practice. During this study it was noted that the normal halothane requirement could be reduced substantially. A second study to investigate this new phenomenon was done on 50 patients who underwent major surgery. The results indicate that adequate anaesthesia can be maintained with flunitrazepam.", 
    "24": "Six rats lever-pressed under a variable-interval 80-sec food reinforcement schedule. After responding had stabilized, an 8-sec tone terminating with food delivery was superimposed on the variable-interval schedule on the average once every five minutes without regard to the animal's behavior. This positive conditioned suppression procedure consistently reduced responding during the pre-food stimulus (tone). Neither d-amphetamine (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/kg) nor chlordiazepoxide (7.5, 15, 30 mg/kg) significantly affected the relative suppression produced by the tone. Instead, both drugs produced generally non-selective effects, similarly affecting response rate in the presence and absence of the tone.", 
    "25": "Some significant correlations are observed between the CNS activities of a series of 59 benzodiazepines and some calculated electronic indices. The parameters concerned are the net charge on the carbonyl oxygen atom of the lactam ring and the total molecular dipole moment, correlations with the latter index being superior. The utility of the observed relationships is discussed.", 
    "26": "Chromosome aberrations induced by MS-4101, diazepam, and nitrazepam were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. Female rats were administered orally via stomach tube daily doses of 200, 500 and 2000 mg/kg of MS-4101, 200 and 500mg/kg of diazepam, 40 and 200mg/kg of nitrazepam and 20 and 50 mg/kg of cylcophosphamide as the positive control for one, 5 and 10 days. In this study, we used bone marrow cells derived from rat femur at 6 or 24 hours after the last drug administration. No significant chromosome aberrations were seen in the treated groups with MS-4101, diazepam, and nitrazepam when compared with the nontreated control. The increase of structural aberration on gap and break was observed in the group of cyclophosphamide as the positive control. These findings indicate that MS-4101, and diazepam and nitrazepam as similar comparative drugs, do not have the potential of induction of chromosome aberrations in rat bone marrow cells.", 
    "27": "Therapeutic aspects of convulsive and non convulsive status epilepticus observed in fourteen patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were studied. A temporal relationship between the status epilepticus onset and the beginning of treatment with chlonazepam and diphenylhydantoin was observed; these drugs withdrawal was followed by suppression of symptoms. The possibility of treating status epilepticus by altering the orally administered therapy and leaving parenteral therapy for such cases with progressive impairment of consciousness and/or neuvoregetative disorders was indicated.", 
    "28": "Twenty infants aged 1-2 years who had previously had one attack of febrile convulsions were randomly given a single dose of diazepam rectally, either as a solution (0.7 mg/kg) or by suppository (5 mg). Plasma-diazepam levels were determined repeatedly during the first hour using gas chromatography. Rectal administration of diazepam in solution resulted in anticonvulsant plasma values within 4 +/- 1 min. Similar plasma levels were obtained only after 20-30 min in the group treated with suppositories. Diazepam in solution given rectally may therefore be useful in the acute treatment of febrile convulsions, while treatment by suppository would seem to be of little value in this respect. Moreover, diazepam in solution given rectally seems suitable for use at home in case of recurrent febrile convulsions. This treatment, however, cannot be recommended until the anticonvulsant effect and side-effects have been elucidated further.", 
    "29": "Phenytoin elimination is a saturable process obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Plasma phenytoin levels are not related linearly to dose, and small changes in enzyme activity produced by concurrent drug therapy could alter plasma levels. Two cases of phenytoin intoxication associated with simultaneous administration of diazepam are reported. Intravenous phenytoin infusions were given and the apparent K(m) and V(max) computed from the resulting plasma phenytoin levels. In one case `K(m)' and `V(max)' were 0.8 \u03bcmol/1 and 1.3 \u03bcmol/1/hour respectively during concurrent diazepam administration, and 50.3 \u03bcmol/1 and 4.4 \u03bcmol/1/hour after discontinuation of diazepam. In the second case phenytoin infusion with diazepam gave `K(m)' and `V(max)' values of 0.012 \u03bcmol/1 and 0.95 \u03bcmol/1/hour. Without diazepam these were 28.8 \u03bcmol/1 and 0.92 \u03bcmol/1/hour respectively.", 
    "30": "Several antitussive agents were assessed for their cough-suppressant activity. Cough responses were obtained by electrically stimulating the lower brainstem, in cats lightly anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital or in unanesthetized midcollicular decerebrate preparations. Cough sounds were recorded with the aid of a microphone. The cough reactive region was concentrated in an area dorsomedial to the trigeminal tract and nucleus. The potency of these antitussive agents (dextromethorphan, RO 21-4790-001, codeine, clonazepam, diazepam and caramiphen) were determined by studying their effect on the centrally induced cough responses. Each of these agents was administered in graded doses intravenously to determine the minimal effective doses for suppressing the cough responses. They are 0.57, 2.55, 1.71, 0.048, 0.28 and 3.18 mg/kg for the above listed drugs. The results indicate that clonazepam was found to be the most potent antitussive among these agents, the mean effective dose being about 1/35 of that of codeine. The antitussive potency of benzodiazepines is not well correlated with their muscle relaxant activity. For instance, clonazepam and diazepam have the same potency in depressing polysynaptic spinal reflexes, whereas the former is six times more potent than diazepam as an antitussive. This finding indicates that clonazepam has a high specificity as an antitussive.", 
    "31": "Diazepam did not appreciably alter the exocrine pancreatic response to exogenous hormones in nonalcoholic and chronicalcoholic dogs. The use of diazepam during experiments in dogs will therefore not significantly affect measurement of pancreatic secretory capacity.", 
    "32": "Fifteen patients with a variety of myoclonic syndromes were studied clinically, pharmacologically, and physiologically. CSF tryptophan, 5HIAA, and HVA were also measured. Of these patients, 8 were improved to varying degrees by therapy with 5HTP, tryptophan in combination with MAOI (but not tryptophan alone), and clonazepam. This group included 6 cases of post-anoxic myoclonus, one case of post-traumatic myoclonus and one undiagnosed case of non-progressive focal myoclonus and epilepsy. In this group low levels of CSF 5HIAA were found compared to non-responsive cases and controls. Two cases of dysynergia cerebellaris myoclonica, 2 cases of undiagnosed aetiology, 2 cases of essential myoclonus, and one case of palatal myoclonus failed to respond to drug therapy. However, even amongst the responsive group the improvement varied. The most dramatic responses were seen in those patients in whom physiological study suggested that myoclonus was mediated by brain-stem structures. Less dramatic responses were seen in patients in whom the myoclonus appeared to originate from cortical structures. The neurochemical basis of myoclonus responding to 5HT precursors and clonazepam is discussed. It is suggested that such myoclonus arises from a relative hypoactivity of the 5HT neuronal system which results in a release of abnormal responses to sensory stimuli which characterize this type of myoclonus.", 
    "33": "Plasma levels of DPA and CNP and associated antiepileptic drugs were measured in groups of respectively 106 and 30 epileptic patients aged from 3 to 49 years. A poor correlation between daily oral dose and plasma levels of both drug was observed when the whole group of patients was considered. A better correlation was seen in a group of adult patients who received DPA and PB. Children below 10 years of age disposed both drugs faster than adults and the difference was significant (p less than 0.01) in groups receiving PB as associated drug. Patients medicated with PB and DPA or CNP showed lower plasma levels of both drugs; on the other hand DPA appeared to cause a decrease of PB clearance which was more marked in children. The clinical significance of the fluctuations of daily plasma levels of both drugs are discussed in relationship to the schedule of administration and plasma sampling. Observations on the therapeutic ranges and adverse effect of the drugs are reported.", 
    "34": "Diazepam and hydroxyzine as i.v. surgical premedicants were compared. A double-blind randomized sequence was used employing 7.5 and 15 mg of diazepam v. 75 and 150 mg of hydroxyzine. Each group consisted of 35 patients. Anxiety relief, sedation, lack of recall and patient acceptance were the principal assessments. Diazepam was superior to hydroxyzine in all respects. No serious side-effects were noted with either drug.", 
    "35": "Bioavailability of drugs following intramuscular injection is reviewed, with particular emphasis on diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, phenytoin, digoxin and lidocaine. Clinical experience with these drugs has shown that i.m. absorption may be slow, erratic or incomplete. Factors which play a role in the bioavailability of i.m. medications include the water solubility of the drug, dispersion of the injected solution and blood flow at the muscle site. For many drugs, intravenous injection is the parenteral route of choice, and oral administration may be more efficacious than i.m. injection.", 
    "36": "Bullous skin lesions that indicate sweat gland necrosis have been known to occur in drug-induced coma resulting from barbiturates and in carbon monoxide poisoning. To our knowledge, this is the first cases in which diazepam is implicated in causing bullous lesions over pressure points, and the first case showing on biopsy specimen eccrine sweat gland and sweat duct necrosis. Penile and oral lesions are being described here for the first time to our knowledge. The following mechanisms could be responsible for the skin lesions: hypoxia, local pressure, hyperthermia with excessive sweating, and a specific toxic effect on the eccrine gland. With the increasing use of the benzodiazepines, such lesions could be seen more frequently in the future.", 
    "37": "This paper reviews major research developments in the biology of mental illness. Theories concerning schizophrenia and affective disease are shown to be based on the mode of action of drugs discovered in the 1950s and used in the treatment of these disorders. Discovery of the endorphins and the development of a new receptor site neurobiology are shown to have a potential major impact on the future of psychiatric research.", 
    "38": "Halothane-nitrous oxide-oxygen (GOF), nitrous oxide-oxygen with diallyl-nor-toxiferine (Jackson-Rees method), or nitrous oxide-oxygen with droperidol-pentazocine (modified NLA) were administered in 190 instances of repair of cleft lips and cleft palates. Epinephrine, 1:30,000, 1:100,000, or 1:300,000, was injected as the vasoconstrictor around the operative field. Epinephrine concentration of 1:100,000 provided sufficient hemostasis, whereas 1:300,000 was insufficient. With the same concentration of epinephrine, GOF and modified NLA seemed to be better than the Jackson-Rees method, since the GOF and modified NLA groups showed less increase of pulse rate, blood pressure, and plethysmographic changes. A 1:30,000 concentration of epinephrine could be used safely with the Jackson-Rees method and the hemostasis with this concentration was superior to 1:100,000. However, it is recommended only for the cleft lip operation, since these patients are younger and need better hemostasis, and hypersalivation after reversal does not disturb the postoperative course. So-called epinephrine-induced arrhythmia with halothane anesthesia occurred in 1 of 34 instances with 1:300,000 solution and in 5 of 48 instances with 1:100,000 solution. Propranolol was given in only one instance. All others returned to normal rhythm with hyperventilation with pure oxygen. The use of 1:100,000 solution of epinephrine as an adjunct with modified NLA is the most satisfactory and safe method for cleft palate operations, and 1:30,000 with the Jackson-Rees is the better method for cleft lip repairs.", 
    "39": "The therapeutics results with the use of different drugs (diazepam, nitrazepam, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin, barbiturates--phenobarbital and primidone--, sodium dipropylacetate and ACTH) in twenty-nine patients with Lennox--Gastaut syndrome are carefully analysed. The effect of each drug on seizures (tonic, tonic-clonic, clonic, myoclonic or myoclonic-atonic, atonic and atypical absences) during the first month of each treatment is discussed. The \"specific\" use of each drug on the various forms of epileptic seizures is determined and the possibility of crisis control with reduction of the drugs dosage is verified.", 
    "40": "Five patients suffering from choreo-athetotic syndromes of different genesis were treated with the benzodiazepine-derivative Ro 06-9098/000 (7-Nitro-1(methylmethoxy)-1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2 H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one). The existing hyperkinesias could be well influenced in four cases of male patients, sufficiently in one case of a female patient. The sedative effect, accompanied by a muscle hypotonia appearing simultaneously under the medication, did not represent and essential limiting factors at the chosen dose of 5--20 mg/die. The observed successes in therapy point at the result and effect of benzodiazepine derivatives on extra-pyramidalmotoric hyperkinesias which got little attention until now.",
