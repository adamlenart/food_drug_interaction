Patients qualified for enrollment if they have experienced an acute coronary syndrome within the prior 30 to 365 days, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack; if they have peripheral vascular disease; or they have diabetes with coronary artery disease. A total of 12,092 patients were randomized to evacetrapib 130 mg or placebo daily in addition to standard medical therapy. The primary efficacy end point is time to first event of CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. Treatment will continue until 1,670 patients reached the primary end point; at least 700 patients reach the key secondary efficacy end point of CV death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and the last patient randomized has been followed up for at least 1.5 years.",

    "3": "Glutamate (Glu) is a major excitatory neurotransmitter involved in epilepsy. Glu is synthesized by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, E.C. 1.4.1.3) and dysfunction of the enzymatic activity of GDH is associated with brain pathologies. The main goal of this work is to establish the role of GDH in the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as valproate (VALP), diazepam (DIAZ) and diphenylhydantoin (DPH) and its repercussions on oxygen consumption. Oxidative deamination of Glu and reductive amination of \u03b1ketoglutarate (\u03b1K) in mice brain were investigated. Our results show that AEDs decrease GDH activity and oxygen consumption in vitro. In ex vivo experiments, AEDs increased GDH activity but decreased oxygen consumption during Glu oxidative deamination. VALP and DPH reversed the increase in reductive amination of \u03b1K caused by the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol. These results suggest that AEDs act by modulating brain GDH activity, which in turn decreased oxygen consumption. GDH represents an important regulation point of neuronal excitability, and modulation of its activity represents a potential target for metabolic treatment of epilepsy and for the development of new AEDs.", 
    "4": "The postmortem redistribution (PMR) phenomenon complicates interpretation in forensic toxicology. Human data on time-dependent PMR are rare and only exist for blood so far. A new method for investigation of time-dependent PMR in blood as well as in alternative body fluids and tissues was developed and evaluated using automated biopsy sampling. At admission of the bodies, introducer needles were placed in liver, lung, kidney, muscle, spleen, adipose tissue, heart, femoral vein, and lumbar spine using a robotic arm guided by a computed tomography scanner (CT). Needle placement accuracy was analyzed and found to be acceptable for the study purpose. Tissue biopsies and small volume body fluid samples were collected in triplicate through the introducer needles. At autopsy (around 24 h after admission), samples from the same body regions were collected. After mastering of the technical challenges, two authentic cases were analyzed as a proof of concept. Drug concentrations of venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, bromazepam, flupentixol, paroxetine, and lorazepam were determined by LC-MS/MS, and the percentage concentration changes between the two time points were calculated. Concentration changes were observed with both increases and decreases depending on analyte and matrix. While venlafaxine, flupentixol, paroxetine, and lorazepam generally showed changes above 30% and more, O-desmethylvenlafaxine and bromazepam did not undergo extensive PMR. The presented study shows that CT-controlled biopsy collection provides a valuable tool for systematic time-dependent PMR investigation, demanding only minimal sample amount and causing minimal damage to the body.",

Five standard diagnostic or therapeutic procedures have been chosen to explore the potential benefit of the \"Choosing Wisely\" initiative: the prescription of benzodiazepines, proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics on discharge from hospital, exposure to ionising radiation in radiological imaging and the number of blood samples taken during hospitalisation. As a first step we compared these variables in the medical and surgical departments of the four major public hospitals in Ticino. We observed significant and unexpected practical differences between specialties and between the different institutions. These results were presented to all concerned healthcare stakeholders. The next steps are to develop continuous monitoring of these indicators and specific recommendations by involving patients in the consciousness-raising process.", 
    "6": "Although we describe a clinical situation that most likely occurs in hundreds of operatory rooms in the world, we report this case as provocation. It concerns an unexpected awakening from an appropriate depth of anesthesia, although the BIS monitor showed a BIS index of less than 50 for a prolonged period before and after the event. Approximately 30 min after induction of anesthesia, the patient had a hypothetic sudden arousal of consciousness, with spontaneous movements, facial muscle activation, intolerance to the tracheal tube, and tearing. After immediate intravenous administration of midazolam (4 mg), the patient returned to a depth of anesthesia status, and surgery was completed uneventfully. The patient had no recall of the event when questioned during the episode, at emergence, or at 24 h, 36 h, and 7 days after surgery. Were these events spinal reflexes to pain or stimulation although the cortex was still anesthetized? Maybe this is the more rational explanation. Was the patient awake but not aware? Is it possible that our patient experienced only a transient arousal from consciousness, and that he did not have recall because the arousal time was short and we blocked memory consolidation? The latter hypothesis provides an opportunity to discuss the evidence that at the moment there is no device to assess the depth of anesthesia. We also focus on the possibility of interfering with memory processing under anesthesia.",

This does not necessarily induce tolerance, but may result in problems such as falling, seizures or delirium if benzodiazepines are discontinued or taken on a long-term basis. Therefore, benzodiazepines can be associated with problems before, during and after surgery, in particular in the elderly. This narrative review aims to describe the clinical relevance for daily practice.",

    "14": "Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental illness in the western world with a major impact on disability. But their diagnosis has lacked objective biomarkers. We previously demonstrated a human anxiety process biomarker, goal-conflict-specific electroencephalography (EEG) rhythmicity (GCSR) in the stop-signal task (SST). Here we have developed and characterized an improved test appropriate for clinical group testing. We modified the SST to produce balanced numbers of trials in clearly separated stop-signal delay groups. As previously, right frontal (F8) GCSR was extracted as the difference in EEG log Fourier power between matching stop and go trials (that is, stop-signal-specific power) of a quadratic contrast of the three delay values (that is, power when stopping and going are in balanced conflict compared with the average of when stopping or going is greater). Separate experiments assessed drug sensitivity (n=34) and personality relations (n=59). GCSR in this new SST was reduced by three chemically distinct anxiolytic drugs (administered double-blind): buspirone (10 mg), triazolam (0.25 mg) and pregabalin (75 mg); had a frequency range (4-12 Hz) consistent with rodent model data; and positively correlated significantly with neuroticism and nonsignificantly with trait anxiety scores. GCSR, measured in our new form of the SST, should be suitable as a biomarker for one specific anxiety process in the testing of clinical groups and novel drugs and in the development of measures suitable for individual diagnosis.",

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the true positive and false positive rates of one of our in-house urine drug screen panels. The urine drugs of abuse panel studied consists of screening by immunoassay then positive immunoassay results were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Reagents from Syva and Microgenics were used for the immunoassay screen. The screen was performed on a Beckman AU5810 random access automated clinical analyzer. The percent of true positives for each immunoassay was determined. Agreement with previously validated GC-MS or LC-MS-MS confirmatory methods was also evaluated. There were 8,825 de-identified screening results for each of the drugs in the panel, except for alcohol (N = 2,296). The percent of samples that screened positive were: 10.0% for amphetamine/methamphetamine/3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), 12.8% for benzodiazepines, 43.7% for opiates (including oxycodone) and 20.3% for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The false positive rate for amphetamine/methamphetamine was \u223c14%, \u223c34% for opiates (excluding oxycodone), 25% for propoxyphene and 100% for phencyclidine and MDMA immunoassays. Based on the results from this retrospective study, the true positive rate for THC drug use among adults were similar to the rate of illicit drug use in young adults from the 2013 National Survey; however, our positivity rate for cocaine was higher than the National Survey.", 
    "16": "The contamination of rivers and other natural water bodies, including underground waters, is a current reality. Human occupation and some economic activities generate a wide range of contaminated effluents that reach these water resources, including psychotropic drug residues. Here we show that fluoxetine, diazepam and risperidone affected the initial development of zebrafish. All drugs increased mortality rate and heart frequency and decreased larvae length. In addition, risperidone and fluoxetine decreased egg hatching. The overall results points to a strong potential of these drugs to cause a negative impact on zebrafish initial development and, since the larvae viability was reduced, promote adverse effects at the population level. We hypothesized that eggs and larvae absorbed the drugs that exert its effects in the central nervous system. These effects on early development may have significant environmental implications.",

We present our findings from cases where NPS have been detected in biological material. During the three-year period 2012-2014 we found NPS in 112 cases (out of 1058 analyzed), with 75 cases in 2014 alone. The prevalence of all NPS (15.1-17.6%) was similar to amphetamine alone that was detected in 15.1-16.5% of cases. The new drugs found belonged to the following classes: cathinones (88%), synthetic cannabinoids (5%), phenethylamines (3%), piperazines and piperidines (3%), arylalkylamines (1%) and other (1%). The drugs detected were (in the order of decreased frequency): 3-MMC (50), \u03b1-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (\u03b1-PVP) (23), pentedrone (16), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-\u03b1-pyrrolidinobutyrophenone (MDPBP) (12), synthetic cannabinoid UR-144 (7), ethcathinone (5), mephedrone (5), methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) (4), 4-methylethcathinone (4-MEC) (3), buphedrone (3), desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP) (3), methylone (2) and 2C-B (2).

One NPS was the sole agent in 35% of all cases, and two or more NPS were present in 19% of cases. NPS (one or more) with other conventional drugs (like amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and benzodiazepines) were detected in most (65%) of the cases. NPS were very often detected in the blood of drivers which was a challenge for toxicologists due to a lack of data on their influence on psychomotor performance. A review of concentrations showed a wide range of values in different types of cases, especially driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) and intoxication.",

Z-drugs have significant hypnotic effects by reducing sleep latency and improving sleep quality, though duration of sleep may not be significantly increased. As benzodiazepines, Z-drugs exert their effects through increasing the transmission of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid. Z-drugs overdose are less likely to be fatal, more likely would result in poisoning. Z-drugs can be detected in blood, urine, saliva, and other postmortem specimens through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. Zolpidem and zaleplon exhibit significant postmortem redistribution. Z-drugs have improved pharmacokinetic profiles, but incidence of neuropsychiatric sequelae, poisoning, and death may prove to be similar to the other hypnotics.

    "23": "The objective of the present work is to study the dissolution behavior of olanzapine from its solid dispersions with PEG 6000. Solid dispersions were prepared by melt dispersion method and characterized by phase solubility studies, drug content and in vitro dissolution studies. The best releasing dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, FT-IR spectroscopy, Near Infrared, Raman analysis and wettability studies. The phase solubility studies and its thermodynamic parameters indicated the spontaneity and solubilization effect of the carrier. The release study results showed greater improvement of drug release from solid dispersions than pure drug and a linear increase in drug release was observed with an increase in carrier content. XRD, DSC, FT-IR, NIR and Raman analysis revealed the crystallinity reduction of olanzapine and its compatibility with the carrier. Wettability studies proved the increased wettability in samples due to water absorbing nature of the carrier. The possible mechanisms for increased release rate are attributed to solubilization effect of the carrier, formation of solid solution, prevention of agglomeration or aggregation of drug particles, change in surface hydrophobicity, increased wettability and dispersability of drug in dissolution medium. The suggested reasons for such release behavior were found to be well supported by results of the evaluation techniques.",

Estrogens have been shown to inhibit dopamine actions, improve neuronal regeneration, and overall, have a protective role in the pathology of schizophrenia. The adjunctive estrogen therapy for men is currently under debate. Antipsychotic medication is known to influence the hypothalamo-hypophyseal - gonadal axis by inducing variable degrees of hyperprolactinemia. Several studies have found that some of the atypical antipsychotics lower cortisol levels in patients and also in healthy controls. We have investigated the effects of clozapine and risperidone on estradiol levels in men with schizophrenia. We have also evaluated the levels of prolactin and cortisol, taking into account the possible influence of antipsychotic drugs on both these hormones. Both prolactin and cortisol also have the potential to regulate sexual hormones biosynthesis.

    "29": "Chronic pain is often treated with narcotic analgesics. The most commonly used narcotic analgesics are the opiates (natural or modified compounds of the poppy plant) or opioids (synthetic chemicals that act on opiate receptors). While opiates and opioids are excellent analgesics, they can also have significant side effects that include respiratory depression, coma, or death. Tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction (psychological dependence) are other severe side effects of opioid use. Patients who develop dependence or addiction often times abuse other, non-opioid narcotics and may trade their prescription medication for illegal street drugs (called \"diversion\"). In order to minimize side effects, detect possible multidrug abuse and prove diversion, simultaneous monitoring of numerous prescription and illicit drugs is required. The method described in this chapter is for the quantitative measurement of 43 different drugs in urine. The panel includes narcotic pain medications, benzodiazepines, NIDA drugs, and other, commonly abused medications. The analytes of interests are injected in the presence of deuterated internal standards to correct for possible extraction inefficiencies, ion suppression, or other interferences. The sample is prepared by adding dilution buffer with the deuterated internal standards to the sample, followed by reversed-phase, gradient HPLC separation on a Phenyl-Hexyl column using water and methanol as mobile phases. Detection of the analytes of interest is done by isotope-dilution mass spectrometry on a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer following electrospray ionization in the positive mode. Mass spectrometric (MS) data are collected in the scheduled MRM (sMRM) mode. Two MRM transitions are monitored for each analyte and one MRM transition is monitored for each IS. Quantitation of the unknown analytes is achieved by comparing the peak area ratios of the analytes to that of the internal standards and reading the unknown concentration from a seven-point calibration curve.",

    "34": "Inhibitors of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain family (BETI) have recently entered phase I clinical trials. In patients with advanced leukemia's, potent antileukemia activity was displayed with minimum dose-limiting toxicity. In preclinical models of hematological malignancies, including aggressive B-cell lymphomas, BETI induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the underlying cell death mechanisms are still not well understood. Dissecting the mechanisms required by BETI to mediate cell death would provide strong direction on how to best utilize BETI to treat patients with aggressive hematological malignancies. Herein, we provide understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BETI-mediated cell death using I-BET762. Induction of cell death occurred in primary murine and human B-cell lymphomas through apoptosis. Genetic dissection using E\u03bc-myc B-cell lymphoma compound mutants demonstrated that I-BET762-induced apoptosis does not require the p53 pathway. Furthermore, deletion of Apaf1, and thus the absence of a functional apoptosome, is associated with a delayed drug response but do not provide long-term resistance. Prolonged treatment of this model in fact fails to suppress the therapeutic efficacy of the drug and is associated with biochemical features of autophagy. However, lack of mitochondrial permeability completely inhibited I-BET762-mediated tumor cell death, indicating mitochondrial damage as key events for its activity. Combination of I-BET762 with BH3-only mimetics ABT-263 or obatoclax, restored sensitivity to I-BET762 lymphoma killing; however, success was determined by expression of Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins. Our study provides critical insight for clinical decisions regarding the appropriate strategy for using BETI as a single agent or in combination to treat patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas.",

We have combined these two samples to study the effects of hostility on study discontinuation as well as to examine correlates and predictors of hostility. Individual data from 1154 patients with complete data were used for analyses. Survival analysis demonstrated that higher hostility was associated with earlier all-cause treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, regression analysis indicated that increased hostility was associated with more severe positive symptoms, lower adherence to pharmacological treatment, younger age, impaired insight, and more drug or alcohol consumption. The clinical implications of the results point to the importance of establishing therapeutic alliance while managing patient's symptoms of hostility with antipsychotics such as olanzapine combined with psychosocial interventions to improve insight and reduce substance use.",

The present review discusses the most important pharmacological effects of natural and synthetic coumarins on the CNS, including their interactions with benzodiazepine receptors, their dopaminergic and serotonergic affinity, and their ability to inhibit cholinesterases and monoamine oxidases. The structure-activity relationships pertaining to these effects are also discussed. This review posits that natural or synthetic coumarins have the potential for development in the therapy of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, schizophrenia, anxiety, epilepsy, and depression.", 
    "37": "The goal of this study was to determine whether there are region-specific or time-dependent changes in GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition of principal neurons in the hippocampus during in vivo status epilepticus. Standard whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological techniques were used to characterize miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in recordings from the principal neurons (PNs) of the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3 in acutely-obtained hippocampal slices from control and lithium/pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus(SE)-treated animals. The reduction in mIPSC amplitude was pervasive across the 3 regions examined in hippocampal slices obtained after 60 min (late) or just 15 min after the onset of SE. The mIPSC frequency was reduced in all 3 regions after 60 min and 2 regions (dentate, CA1) after 15 min. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that a rapid modification of the postsynaptic GABAA receptor population leads to a widespread decline in GABA-mediated inhibition that, in part, contributes to both the self-sustaining nature of SE and to the decrease in the efficacy of benzodiazepines.",

In this study a dispersive nanomaterial-ultrasound assisted- microextraction (DNUM) method followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for the preconcentration and determination of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam drugs from urine and plasma samples. Various parameters such as amount of adsorbent (mg: ZnS-AC), pH and ionic strength of sample solution, vortex and ultrasonic time (min), and desorption volume (mL) were investigated by fractional factorial design (FFD) and central composite design (CCD). Regression models and desirability functions (DF) were applied to find the best experimental conditions for providing the maximum extraction recovery (ER). Under the optimal conditions a linear calibration curve were obtained in the range of 0.005-10\u03bcgmL(-1) and 0.006-10\u03bcgmL(-1) for chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, respectively. To demonstrate the analytical performance, figures of merits of the proposed method in urine and plasma spiked with chlordiazepoxide and diazepam were investigated.

This first-in-human study was performed in healthy male subjects using a single-dose, parallel, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-escalation study design. In total six cohorts (N=48) were enrolled. The eight subjects of each cohort received NS11821 (10 mg, 30 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg or 600 mg) or placebo in a 6:2 ratio. At low dose levels, NS11821 had a relatively low exposure and a more-than-proportional increase of the area under the curve and maximum plasma concentrations, probably due to poor solubility. Saccadic peak velocity decreased in a dose-related manner while limited impairments were seen on body sway and the visual analogue scale for alertness. The most common adverse events were somnolence and dizziness, which were more prominent with the higher doses. Although no positive control was used in this study, the results were compared post hoc with a Centre for Human Drug Research dataset for lorazepam 2 mg. The maximum saccadic peak velocity effects seemed comparable to the typical effects of lorazepam, whereas the other central nervous system effects were smaller. These results support the pharmacological selectivity of NS11821 and show that pharmacodynamic effective doses of NS11821 were safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects.", 
    "57": "The type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R) has multiple physiologic roles relating to nutrient homeostasis, including mediation of postcibal satiety. This effect has been central in efforts to develop agonists of this receptor as part of a program to manage and/or prevent obesity. While a number of small molecule CCK1R agonists have been developed, none have yet been approved for clinical use, based on inadequate efficacy, side effects, or the potential for toxicity. Understanding the molecular details of docking and mechanism of action of these ligands can be helpful in the rational refinement and enhancement of small molecule drug candidates. In the current work, we have defined the mechanism of binding and activity of two triazolobenzodiazepinones, CE-326597 and PF-04756956, which are reported to be full agonist ligands. To achieve this, we utilized receptor binding with a series of allosteric and orthosteric radioligands at structurally related CCK1R and CCK2R, as well as chimeric CCK1R/CCK2R constructs exchanging residues in the allosteric pocket, and assessment of biological activity. These triazolobenzodiazepinones docked within the intramembranous small molecule allosteric ligand pocket, with higher affinity binding to CCK2R than CCK1R, yet with biological activity exclusive to or greatly enhanced at CCK1R. These ligands exhibited cooperativity with benzodiazepine binding across the CCK1R homodimeric complex, resulting in their ability to inhibit only a fraction of the saturable binding of a benzodiazepine radioligand, unlike other small molecule antagonists and agonists of this receptor. This may contribute to the understanding of the unique short duration and reversible gallbladder contraction observed in vivo upon administration of these drugs.", 
    "58": "This paper describes the development and validation of a simple and efficient bioanalytical procedure for simultaneous determination of alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam in human serum samples using high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detection, regarding a fast elution methodology in 4 min. Briefly, this method consists of a simple liquid extraction step of serum samples followed by HPLC analysis on a C18 column. After confirming the absence of matrix effect, an external standard methodology has been applied for quantification purposes. Due to the presence of serum endogenous components as uncalibrated components in the sample, the second-order calibration based on alternating trilinear decomposition has been applied on a set of absorbance matrices collected as a function of retention time and wavelengths. Acceptable resolution and quantification results were achieved in the presence of matrix interferences and the second-order advantage was fully exploited. The average recoveries for alprazolam, clonazepam and diazepam were 89.1%, 96.3% and 94.7% and relative standard deviation values for intra- and inter-day precision were equal or lower than 8.1% and 9.4%, respectively. The developed method enabled us to determine the analytes in the various serum samples in the presence of overlapped profiles, while keeping experimental time and extraction step at the minimum.", 
    "59": "Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury death in the United States, and most deaths are related to prescription drugs. A substantial proportion of these deaths involve opioid or benzodiazepine drugs, and many overdoses include a combination of both drug classes. Buprenorphine/naloxone has an unusual pharmacology that distinguishes it from other opioid drugs. Animal and human studies have found that buprenorphine is associated with a ceiling to its cardio-respiratory depressant effect at higher doses, such that it may have a wider safety margin compared to other opioid drugs. Compared to buprenorphine alone, buprenorphine/naloxone is associated with less cardiorespiratory depression. Drug safety data from the National Poison Data System, Drug Abuse Warning Network, and other sources suggest that the safety of buprenorphine/naloxone is favorable compared to the morbidity and mortality associated with other opioid drugs and other classes of psychotropic drugs.",

The odds for multiple prescriber episodes were significantly higher among patients with multiple chronic conditions. Consecutive overlapping prescriptions had the best accuracy to detect patients with potentially questionable prescribed quantities as well as to predict those with multiple prescriber episodes in the subsequent year.",

Fifty-five persons with schizophrenia, 21 with bipolar psychosis or psychotic depression and 20 with other psychoses from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 were examined at about 43 years of age. The frequency of use and dosage of psychiatric medication and the factors associated with the use of antipsychotics were analysed. Antipsychotics were used by 85% of schizophrenia, 65% of bipolar psychosis or psychotic depression and 62% of other psychoses cases; antidepressants were used by 22%, 60% and 33%; and benzodiazepines by 42%, 35% and 10%, respectively. In all the diagnostic groups, higher symptom scores and a higher number of hospital days were associated with the use of antipsychotics. In schizophrenia and other psychoses, poorer social and occupational functioning, and in other psychoses, female gender and lower education were also associated with the use of antipsychotics. Our results may partly indicate that, especially in schizophrenia, the effectiveness of antipsychotics is not as good as expected.", 
    "65": "The pharmacokinetics of cytochrome P450 probes in humans can be extrapolated from corresponding data in cynomolgus monkeys using simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. In the current study, despite some species difference in drug clearances, this modeling methodology was adapted to estimate human plasma concentrations of P450 probes based on data from commonly used medium-sized experimental animals, namely dogs and minipigs. Using known species allometric scaling factors and in vitro metabolic clearance data, the observed plasma concentrations of slowly eliminated caffeine and warfarin and rapidly eliminated omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam in two young dogs were scaled to human oral monitoring equivalents. Using the same approach, the previously reported pharmacokinetics of the five P450 probes in minipigs was also scaled to human monitoring equivalents. The human plasma concentration profiles of the five P450 probes estimated by the simplified human PBPK models based on observed/reported pharmacokinetics in dogs/minipigs were consistent with previously published pharmacokinetic data in humans. These results suggest that dogs and minipigs, in addition to monkeys, could be suitable models for humans during research into new drugs, especially when used in combination with simple PBPK models.",

    "74": "Analgesia and sedation of patients in the neuro intensive care unit, in particular in case of intracranial hypertension, remains a challenge even today. A goal for analgesia and sedation should be set for each individual patient (RASS -5 in case of intracranial hypertension) and should be re-evaluated repeatedly based on standardized scores (RASS plus EEG monitoring where appropriate, NCS). There are no sufficient evidence-based sedation algorithms in this patient cohort. Remifentanil, sufentanil and fentanyl have been proven safe and effective for continuous application; however, bolus application should be avoided. (S-)Ketamin can be considered safe when mechanical ventilation and sedation with GABA receptor agonists are applied. Propofol and benzodiazepines are equally safe and effective with shorter wake up times for propofol. The use of barbitarutes is restricted to intractable intracranial hypertension or status epilepicus. Evidence for alpha-2-adrenoceptoragonists and inhalative sedation is poor and requires further research.",

The drugs most commonly involved are analgesics, particularly opioids, and psychoactive drugs, particularly benzodiazepines. Diverted drugs are most often sourced from a family member or friend, but are also sourced from overseas pharmacies or laboratories, or bought from drug dealers. Drug diversion can be mitigated by good prescribing practices. Systems for monitoring the prescribing and dispensing of medicines are being instituted across Australia.", 
    "77": "There are well-recognised harms from long-term use of benzodiazepines. These include dependency, cognitive decline and falls. It is important to prevent and recognise benzodiazepine dependence. A thorough risk assessment guides optimal management and the necessity for referral. The management of dependence involves either gradual benzodiazepine withdrawal or maintenance treatment. Prescribing interventions, substitution, psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies can all contribute. Unless the patient is elderly, it is helpful to switch to a long-acting benzodiazepine in both withdrawal and maintenance therapy. The dose should be gradually reduced over weeks to lower the risk of seizures. Harms from drugs such as zopiclone and zolpidem are less well characterised. Dependence is managed in the same manner as benzodiazepine dependence.", 
    "78": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are anxiolytic drugs that impair memory acquisition. Previous studies using the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PMDAT, which assesses memory and anxiety concomitantly) indicated that the effects of BDZs on anxiety and acquisition are related to each other. The possible influence of the anxiolytic action of BDZs on their effects on memory retrieval and extinction are poorly understood. This is relevant considering the relationship between aversive memories and anxiety disorders. We designed a modified protocol of PMDAT that evaluates anxiety during retrieval and extinction of the task. Male Wistar rats were trained in the PMDAT (plus-maze with two open and two enclosed arms) using a standard or a modified protocol. In the standard protocol, the aversive stimuli were presented in one of the enclosed arms during training, and the animal had free access to the whole apparatus. In the modified protocol, the open arms were blocked with glass walls. Twenty-four hours after training, the animals subjected to each of the protocols were treated with saline or 2.0mg/kg of diazepam (DZP) 30min before the test. There was a third session in the maze (retest) 24h after the test. During the test, DZP impaired and improved retrieval in rats that had been trained in the standard and the modified protocol when compared to the respective saline-treated groups. In addition, treatment with DZP prior to the test induced anxiolysis, but only in the animals that were not pre-exposed to the open arms of the apparatus (modified protocol). In these animals, DZP impaired extinction, which was evaluated during retest session. The impairing effect of DZP on extinction seems to be related to its anxiolytic action during the test (extinction learning). Further, we suggest that aversive memory retrieval depends on both the treatment and the arousal elicited by exposure to the apparatus.",

However, there is little data describing the types of substances that are associated with endotracheal intubation or the rates of intubation after these exposures. Evaluation of this association may inform future research on intubation after exposures to specific substances and guide poison prevention education. Our objective was to determine which exposures were commonly associated with intubation using the data from National Poison Data System (NPDS). The NPDS tracks data from potential exposures to substances reported to all American Association of Poison Control Centers. We performed a retrospective analysis of NPDS data from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2013 to identify human exposures to substances that were associated with endotracheal intubation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. There were 93,474 single substance exposures and 228,507 multiple substance exposures that were associated with intubation. The most common exposures to substances that were associated with intubation were atypical antipsychotics (7.4\u00a0%) for single exposures and benzodiazepines (27.4\u00a0%) for multiple exposures. Within each age group, the most common known exposures to substances were for patients under 6\u00a0years, clonidine for single and multiple exposures; for patients aged 6-12\u00a0years, clonidine for single exposures and atypical antipsychotics for multiple exposures; for patients aged 13-19\u00a0years, atypical antipsychotics for single and multiple exposures; and for patients over 19\u00a0years, atypical antipsychotics for single exposures and benzodiazepines for multiple exposures. From 2000-2013, the exposures to substances most commonly associated with intubation varied by single versus multiple exposures and by age.

Evidence is increasing that volatile anesthetic agents are associated with faster extubation times, improved cardiovascular stability with no end-organ toxicity in comparison to our standard intravenous agents for short-term critical care sedation. Use of volatile agents within the ICU is a novel technique using a specialized delivery and scavenging system, which requires staff training and cultural acceptance.

    "90": "Colonoscopy is an invaluable tool for the screening and diagnosis of many colonic diseases. For most colonoscopies, moderate sedation is used during the procedure. However, insufflation of the colon produces a nociceptive stimulus that is usually accompanied by facial grimacing/groaning while under sedation. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a nociceptive signal elicited by colonic insufflation could be measured from the brain. Seventeen otherwise healthy patients (age 54.8 \u00b1 9.1; 6 female) undergoing routine colonoscopy (ie, no history of significant medical conditions) were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Moderate sedation was produced using standard clinical protocols for midazolam and meperidine, titrated to effect. Near-infrared spectroscopy data captured during the procedure was analyzed offline to evaluate the brains' responses to nociceptive stimuli evoked by the insufflation events (defined by physician or observing patients' facial responses). Analysis of NIRS data revealed a specific, reproducible prefrontal cortex activity corresponding to times when patients grimaced. The pattern of the activation is similar to that previously observed during nociceptive stimuli in awake healthy individuals, suggesting that this approach may be used to evaluate brain activity evoked by nociceptive stimuli under sedation, when there is incomplete analgesia. Although some patients report recollection of procedural pain after the procedure, the effects of repeated nociceptive stimuli in surgical patients may contribute to postoperative changes including chronic pain. The results from this study indicate that NIRS may be a suitable technology for continuous nociceptive afferent monitoring in patients undergoing sedation and could have applications under sedation or anesthesia.", 
    "91": "Phenytoin is an established drug in the treatment of acute repetitive seizures and status epilepticus. One of its main advantages over benzodiazepines is the less sedative effect. However, the possibility of cardiovascular adverse effects with the intravenous use of phenytoin cause a reluctance to its usage, and this has lead to a search for safer anticonvulsant drugs. In this study, we aimed to review the studies which evaluated the safety of phenytoin with respect to cardiovascular adverse effects. The original clinical trials and case reports listed in PUBMED in English language between the years of 1946-2014 were evaluated. As the key words, \"phenytoin, diphenylhydantoin, epilepsy, seizure, cardiac toxicity, asystole, arrhythmia, respiratory arrest, hypotension, death\" were used. Thirty-two clinical trials and ten case reports were identified. In the case reports, a rapid infusion rate (>50\u00a0mg/min) of phenytoin appeared as the major cause of increased mortality. In contrast, no serious cardiovascular adverse effects leading to death were met in the clinical trials which applied the recommended infusion rate and dosages. An infusion rate of 50\u00a0mg/min was reported to be safe for young patients. For old patients and patients with a cardiovascular co-morbidity, a slower infusion rate was recommended with a careful follow-up of heart rhythm and blood pressure. No cardiovascular adverse effect was reported in oral phenytoin overdoses except one case with a very high serum phenytoin level and hypoalbuminemia. Phenytoin is an effective and well tolerated drug in the treatment of epilepsy. Intravenous phenytoin is safe when given at recommended infusion rates and doses.", 
    "92": "Using positron emission tomography (PET), the present study assessed the binding of [(11)C]flumazenil to GABA-A receptors in anesthetized rats following a single intravenous injection of an active dose of either etifoxine (25mg/kg) or diazepam (1mg/kg), which are both anxiolytic drugs. [(11)C]flumazenil binding was measured in five discrete brain structures, namely the caudate putamen, hippocampus, cerebellum, occipital cortex and parietal cortex. As expected, diazepam injection produced a significant decrease in [(11)C]flumazenil binding, which was interpreted as benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor occupancy, whereas etifoxine increased the binding of [(11)C]flumazenil. This first use of in vivo imaging after etifoxine administration revealed the activated binding pattern of [(11)C]flumazenil and highlighted the pharmacological differences between etifoxine and benzodiazepines. Using the same [(11)C]flumazenil radiotracer, PET neuroimaging could be applied to larger animals and, ultimately, to human subjects, thus providing new perspectives for better defining the molecular pharmacology of etifoxine.",

Although ABT has been widely used, the extent and duration of its inhibitory effect is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to characterize ABT inhibition of CYP in rats at both the hepatic and intestinal levels. In vivo studies using midazolam (p.o. and i.v.), as a probe for CYP activity, demonstrated that CYP inhibition was not complete even at the highest dose (300 mg/kg). Additional in vivo studies demonstrated that even at 26 h following ABT administration, there was significant CYP inhibition remaining. In vitro studies, conducted in both rat liver microsomes and rat hepatocytes, confirm that ABT is a time-dependent inhibitor of rat CYP orthologs. However, in rat liver microsomes, there was more than 15% CYP activity remaining following a 60 min preincubation at 2 mm ABT and 5-10% of CYP activity was remaining in rat hepatocytes suspended in rat plasma following a 60 min preincubation at 2 mm ABT. 1-Aminobenzotriazole is a useful tool in elucidating the oxidative component of metabolism in preclinical species; however, conclusions made from the preclinical use of ABT should not operate under the assumption that CYP enzymatic activity is completely inhibited.

Furthermore, at any given time, up to 16% of drivers may be using drugs that can impair one's driving abilities (NHTSA, 2009). Currently, drug recognition experts (DREs; law enforcement officers with specialized training to identify drugged driving), have the most difficult time with identifying drivers potentially impaired on central nervous system (CNS) depressants (Smith et al., 2002). The fact that the use of benzodiazepines, a type of CNS depressant, is also associated with the greatest likelihood of causing accidents (Dassanayake et al., 2011), further emphasizes the need to improve research tools in this area which can facilitate the refinement of, or additions to, current assessments of impaired driving. Our laboratories collaborated to evaluate both the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of a benzodiazepine, alprazolam, in a driving simulation (miniSim(TM)). This drive was combined with a neurocognitive assessment utilizing time synched neurophysiology (electroencephalography, ECG). While the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines are well characterized (Rapoport et al., 2009), we hypothesized that, with the addition of real-time neurophysiology and the utilization of simulation and neurocognitive assessment, we could find objective assessments of drug impairment that could improve the detection capabilities of DREs. Our analyses revealed that (1) specific driving conditions were significantly more difficult for benzodiazepine impaired drivers and (2) the neurocognitive tasks' metrics were able to classify \"impaired\" vs. \"unimpaired\" with up to 80% accuracy based on lane position deviation and lane departures. While this work requires replication in larger studies, our results not only identified criteria that could potentially improve the identification of benzodiazepine intoxication by DREs, but also demonstrated the promise for future studies using this approach to improve upon current, real-world assessments of impaired driving.",

Albino mice were pretreated with extract in different doses (10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg), prior to injection of pentylenetetrazole. Animals received pretreatments with naloxone and flumazenil to further clarify the mechanisms of anticonvulsant action. The total flavonoid content of Citrullus colocynthis extract was also determined. Citrullus colocynthis hydroalcoholic extract with doses 25 and 50 mg/kg prolonged the onset of seizures and decreased the duration compared with control group. Pretreatment by flumazenil could inhibit the effect of Citrullus colocynthis on latency of seizure to some extent and administration of naloxone significantly inhibited changes in latency and duration of seizure produced by Citrullus colocynthis This study showed that Citrullus colocynthis has significant anticonvulsant effect in pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in mice, and these effects may be related to its effect on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic and opioid systems. These results confirmed the traditional use of Citrullus colocynthis in Iranian traditional medicine.",

    "143": "The GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) provide the primary source of inhibition within the thalamus. Using physiology, pharmacology, and immunohistochemistry in mice, we characterized postsynaptic developmental changes in these inhibitory projection neurons. First, at postnatal days 3-5 (P3-5), inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) decayed very slowly, followed by a biphasic developmental progression, becoming faster at P6-8 and then slower again at P9-11 before stabilizing in a mature form around P12. Second, the pharmacological profile of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated IPSCs differed between neonatal and mature nRt neurons, and this was accompanied by reciprocal changes in \u03b13 (late) and \u03b15 (early) subunit expression in nRt. Zolpidem, selective for \u03b11- and \u03b13-containing GABA(A)Rs, augmented only mature IPSCs, whereas clonazepam enhanced IPSCs at all stages. This effect was blocked by the \u03b15-specific inverse agonist L-655,708, but only in immature neurons. In \u03b13(H126R) mice, in which \u03b13-subunits were mutated to become benzodiazepine insensitive, IPSCs were enhanced compared with those in wild-type animals in early development. Third, tonic GABA(A)R activation in nRt is age dependent and more prominent in immature neurons, which correlates with early expression of \u03b15-containing GABA(A)Rs. Thus neonatal nRt neurons show relatively high expression of \u03b15-subunits, which contributes to both slow synaptic and tonic extrasynaptic inhibition. The postnatal switch in GABA(A)R subunits from \u03b15 to \u03b13 could facilitate spontaneous network activity in nRt that occurs at this developmental time point and which is proposed to play a role in early circuit development.", 
    "144": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that mimics many of the clinical and pathological features of multiple sclerosis. We have previously described a significant diminution in the GABAergic regulation of glutamate release from synaptosomes of EAE rats isolated during the acute stage of the disease. In order to explore the possible metabolic pathways responsible for this alteration, in this work we evaluate the direct effect of different GABAergic agonists on the glutamate release and concomitant synapsin I phosphorylation in synaptosomes from the frontal cortex of control and EAE animals. The results show that GABA as well as the GABA receptor agonists Muscimol (GABAA agonist) and Baclofen (GABAB agonist) caused a decrease in glutamate release in control rats paralleled by a similar reduction in synapsin I phosphorylation. Meanwhile synaptosomes from EAE animals are responsive only to Baclofen with respect to nontreated EAE synaptosomes, since glutamate release from the synaptosomes treated with Muscimol was similar to that observed in EAE rat synaptosomes which was already reduced as consequence of the disease. In the case of the benzodiazepines Diazepam and Clonazepam (GABAA allosteric agonists), both of them induced a reduction in glutamate release in synaptosomes from the CFA rats, effect that was only observed in synaptosomes of EAE rats treated with Clonazepam. In all cases both benzodiazepines showed a higher effect on synapsin I phosphorylation than in glutamate release. These results indicate that the extent of GABAergic modulation of presynaptic terminals depends on the type of agonist employed and this regulation is altered in the frontal cortex during the acute phase of EAE with respect to control animals.",

    "153": "Aging is associated with an increased risk of seizures/epilepsy. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and cardiac arrest related brain injury are two major causative factors for seizure development in this patient population. With either etiology, seizures are a poor prognostic factor. In spite of this, the underlying pathophysiology of seizure development is not well understood. In addition, a standardized treatment regimen with anticonvulsants and outcome assessments following treatment has yet to be established for these post-ischemic seizures. Previous studies have modeled post-ischemic seizures in adult rodents, but similar studies in aging/aged animals, a group that mirrors a higher risk elderly population, remain sparse. Our study therefore aimed to investigate early-onset seizures in aging animals using a hypoxia-ischemia (HI) model. Male C57 black mice 18-20-month-old underwent a unilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery followed by a systemic hypoxic episode (8% O2 for 30 min). Early-onset seizures were detected using combined behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Brain injury was assessed histologically at different times post HI. Convulsive seizures were observed in 65% of aging mice post-HI but not in control aging mice following either sham surgery or hypoxia alone. These seizures typically occurred within hours of HI and behaviorally consisted of jumping, fast running, barrel-rolling, and/or falling (loss of the righting reflex) with limb spasms. No evident discharges during any convulsive seizures were seen on cortical-hippocampal EEG recordings. Seizure development was closely associated with acute mortality and severe brain injury on brain histological analysis. Intra-peritoneal injections of lorazepam and fosphenytoin suppressed seizures and improved survival but only when applied prior to seizure onset and not after. These findings together suggest that seizures are a major contributing factor to acute mortality in aging mice following severe brain ischemia and that early anticonvulsive treatment may prevent seizure genesis and improve overall outcomes.",

Based on the favourable tolerability profile of levetiracetam and valproate, the authors prefer these drugs in established SE over phenytoin. Treatment options in refractory SE are intravenous anaesthetics. In super-refractory SE ketamine, magnesium, steroids and other drugs have been used with variable outcomes. At this stage therapeutic decisions are based on doctors' preferences, patient factors such as age and comorbidity, and cause of SE, if identified.",

However, the neuronal mechanism underlying DHF action remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the action of DHF on GABAA receptors using a silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) model. Additionally, we investigated the effect of DHF exposure on stress-induced cortisol modulation. Chemical identification was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and purity was evaluated using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. To an aquarium, we applied between 2.5 and 50 mg/L DHF diluted in ethanol, in combination with 42.7 mg/L diazepam. DHF within the range of 10-20 mg/L acted collaboratively in combination with diazepam, but the sedative action of DHF was reversed by 3 mg/L flumazenil. Additionally, fish exposed for 24 h to 2.5-20 mg/L DHF showed no side effects and there was sustained sedation during the first 12 h of drug exposure with 10-20 mg/L DHF. DHF pretreatment did not increase plasma cortisol levels in fish subjected to a stress protocol. Moreover, the stress-induced cortisol peak was absent following pretreatment with 20 mg/L DHF. DHF proved to be a relatively safe sedative or anesthetic, which interacts with GABAergic and cortisol pathways in fish.",

    "160": "Function of the mammalian translocator protein (TSPO; previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) remains unclear because its presumed role in steroidogenesis and mitochondrial permeability transition established using pharmacological methods has been refuted in recent genetic studies. Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) is considered a conserved endogenous ligand for TSPO. In bacteria, TSPO was identified to regulate tetrapyrrole metabolism and chemical catalysis of PPIX in the presence of light, and in vertebrates, TSPO function has been linked to porphyrin transport and heme biosynthesis. Positive correlation between high TSPO expression in cancer cells and susceptibility to photodynamic therapy based on their increased ability to convert the precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to PPIX appeared to reinforce this mechanism. In this study, we used TSPO knock-out (Tspo(-/-)) mice, primary cells, and different tumor cell lines to examine the role of TSPO in erythropoiesis, heme levels, PPIX biosynthesis, phototoxic cell death, and mitochondrial bioenergetic homeostasis. In contrast to expectations, our results demonstrate that TSPO deficiency does not adversely affect erythropoiesis, heme biosynthesis, bioconversion of ALA to PPIX, and porphyrin-mediated phototoxic cell death. TSPO expression levels in cancer cells do not correlate with their ability to convert ALA to PPIX. In fibroblasts, we observed that TSPO deficiency decreased the oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) indicative of a cellular metabolic shift, without a negative impact on porphyrin biosynthetic capability. Based on these findings, we conclude that mammalian TSPO does not have a critical physiological function related to PPIX and heme biosynthesis.",

The effects of trans-\u03b5-viniferin in \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32L and \u03b12\u03b22\u03b32L receptors werealso not sensitive to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil while, in the \u03b15\u03b23\u03b32L subtype the effect was not sensitive to the inverse agonist L-655,708, indicating different binding sites for this molecule.", 
    "178": "The results of the present study indicate that both resveratrol and trans-\u03b5-viniferin modulate the GABA-induced current in different ways, and that trans-\u03b5-viniferin may be a lead compound for the discovery of agents which selectively inhibit the GABA-induced current in \u03b11-containing subtypes.This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

Considering that the risks of using old and new AEDs during pregnancy are still debated, our aim is to review the available evidence on this topic.", 
    "180": "Narrative overview, synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases.", 
    "181": "The old AEDs generation (benzodiazepines, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and valproic acid) is teratogenic: minor congenital malformations, such as facial dysmorphism and other anomalies, occur in 6-20% of infants exposed to AEDs in utero; this value is two times greater than the value reported in the general population. Major congenital malformations (MCM) such as cleft lip and cleft palate, heart defects (atrial septal defect, Fallot's tetralogy, ventricular septal defect, aortic coarctation, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary stenosis) and urogenital anomalies were estimated to be 4-6% of infants born from mothers treated with AEDs, compared to 2-3% of the general population.", 
    "182": "It is essential to inform women treated with AED that planning pregnancy is necessary, when possible. The problems related to antiepileptic therapy and the possibilities of prenatal diagnosis should be accurately discussed with the patient, when possible before pregnancy: individual circumstances, desire to have children, severity of epilepsy, risks of seizures, family history of congenital malformations and all other potential risk factors must be considered, involving the patient in shared clinical decision-making.", 
    "183": "Despite its success in treating specific anxiety disorders, the effect of exposure therapy is limited by problems with tolerability, treatment resistance, and fear relapse after initial response. The identification of novel drug targets facilitating fear extinction in clinically relevant animal models may guide improved treatment strategies for these disorders in terms of efficacy, acceleration of fear extinction, and return of fear.", 
    "184": "The extinction-facilitating potential of neuropeptide S, D-cycloserine, and a benzodiazepine was investigated in extinction-impaired high anxiety HAB rats and 129S1/SvImJ mice using a classical cued fear conditioning paradigm followed by extinction training and several extinction test sessions to study fear relapse.", 
    "185": "Administration of D-cycloserine improved fear extinction in extinction-limited, but not in extinction-deficient, rodents compared with controls. Preextinction neuropeptide S caused attenuated fear responses in extinction-deficient 129S1/SvImJ mice at extinction training onset and further reduced freezing during this session. While the positive effects of either D-cycloserine or neuropeptide S were not persistent in 129S1/SvImJ mice after 10 days, the combination of preextinction neuropeptide S with postextinction D-cycloserine rendered the extinction memory persistent and context independent up to 5 weeks after extinction training. This dual pharmacological adjunct to extinction learning also protected against fear reinstatement in 129S1/SvImJ mice.", 
    "186": "By using the potentially nonsedative anxiolytic neuropeptide S and the cognitive enhancer D-cycloserine to facilitate deficient fear extinction, we provide here the first evidence of a purported efficacy of a dual over a single drug approach. This approach may render exposure sessions less aversive and more efficacious for patients, leading to enhanced protection from fear relapse in the long term.",

Multiple-drug treatments have been developed to mitigate chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. A patient-controlled infusion of diphenhydramine hydrochloride, lorazepam, and dexamethasone sodium phosphate has been studied in patients who are refractory to first-line therapy. Unfortunately, the physical and chemical compatibility of this three-drug combination is not available in the published literature. Chemical compatibility was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Visual observation was employed to detect change in color, clarity, or gas evolution. Turbidity and pH measurements were performed in conjunction with visual observation at hours 0, 24, and 48. Results showed that diphenhydramine hydrochloride 4 mg/mL, lorazepam 0.16 mg/mL, and dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.27 mg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride stored in polypropylene syringes were compatible, and components retained greater than 95% of their original concentration over 48 hours when stored at room temperature.",

    "189": "At 6 months, we assessed factors associated with higher rates of substance use in buprenorphine program participants that completed a baseline survey one month post-Sandy (i.e. shorter length of time in treatment, exposure to storm losses, a pre-storm history of positive opiate urine drug screens, and post-disaster psychiatric symptoms).", 
    "190": "Risk factors of interest extracted from the electronic medical records included pre-disaster diagnosis of Axis I and/or II disorders and length of treatment up to the disaster. Factors collected from the baseline survey conducted approximately one month post-Sandy included self-reported buprenorphine supply disruption, health insurance status, disaster exposure, and post-Sandy screenings for PTSD and depression. Outcome variables reviewed 6 months post-Sandy included missed appointments, urine drug results for opioids, cocaine, and benzodiazepines.", 
    "191": "129 (98%) patients remained in treatment at 6 months, and had no sustained increases in opioid-, cocaine-, and benzodiazepine-positive urine drug tests in any sub-groups with elevated substance use in the baseline survey. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, diagnosis of Axis I and/or II disorders pre-Sandy were associated with significantly less opioid-positive urine drug findings in the 6 months following Sandy compared to the rest of the clinic population.",

    "194": "In a double-blind clinical trial, 32 children were diagnosed with ileocolic intussusception based on sonographic findings, were studied and randomly divided into two groups. After obtaining written informed consent from the parents, 5 minutes before reduction, an intravenous Midazolam at the concentration of 1.0 mg/kg (up to 3 mg) was infused, and then barium reduction was performed under fluoroscopy guideline. In the control group, sterile water was injected as placebo and the remaining reduction steps were performed compared with the experiment group.", 
    "195": "Of 16 patients that received Midazolam, 15 patients demonstrated successful reduction; and of 16 patients that received distilled water, only 11 patients showed successful reduction (P=0.07). The mean duration of a successful reduction in the Midazolam group and placebo was 34.8\u00b111.35 and 32.73\u00b119.2 min, respectively (P=0.733).", 
    "196": "The use of Midazolam as a benzodiazepine with known sedative and muscle relaxant effects can increase the success rate of enema reduction in intussusception.", 
    "197": "Background A new class of hallucinogens called NBOMes has emerged. This class includes analogues 25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe. Case reports and judicial seizures indicate that 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe are more prevalently abused. There have been a few confirmed reports of 25B-NBOMe use or toxicity. Report Observational case series. This report describes a series of 10 patients who suffered adverse effects from 25B-NBOMe. Hallucinations and violent agitation predominate along with serotonergic/stimulant signs such as mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension and hyperthermia. The majority (7/10) required sedation with benzodiazepines. Analytical method 25B-NBOMe concentrations in plasma and urine were quantified in all patients using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Peak plasma levels were measured between 0.7-10.1 ng/ml. Discussion The NBOMes are desired by users because of their hallucinogenic and stimulant effects. They are often sold as LSD or synthetic LSD. Reported cases of 25B- NBOMe toxicity are reviewed and compared to our series. Seizures and one pharmacological death have been described but neither were observed in our series. Based on our experience with cases of mild to moderate toxicity, we suggest that management should be supportive and focused on preventing further (self) harm. High doses of benzodiazepines may be required to control agitation. Patients who develop significant hyperthermia need to be actively managed. Conclusions Effects from 25B-NBOMe in our series were similar to previous individual case reports. The clinical features were also similar to effects from other analogues in the class (25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe). Violent agitation frequently present along with signs of serotonergic stimulation. Hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis and kidney injury were also observed.",

    "201": "261 segments were coded, divided into four areas. The first, \"changes in contemporary world\", pointed out that the recession may have just made pre-existing problems worse, accelerating reductions in staff and workers' benefits. The second, \"social area\", highlighted a decrease in vertical social capital and the beginning of new trends in emigration. The third, \"work area\", covered workers' fear of losing their jobs if they were ill and a reduction in horizontal social capital, namely difficult relations between co-workers. The fourth, \"medical area\", indicated a general worsening of workers' health in the Sassuolo ceramic district compared to previous years. The OHPs reported an increase in muscular-skeletal complaints, gastritis, tension-type headache, irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, back pain, panic attacks, insomnia, tachycardia, and other medically unexplained symptoms. Anxiety problems seemed to prevail over depressive manifestations. An increase was reported for antidepressants and benzodiazepines consumption.", 
    "202": "The local impact of the economic crisis on health was mainly negative, consistent with available national data.

    "205": "We recruited 76 patients with an indication of TEE; the age range was 18-83 years. In Group T there were 26 patients who had the procedure under topical pharyngeal anaesthesia, in Group D there were 23 patients who received midazolam, and in Group H there were 27 patients receiving hypnosis. All patients had an IV access; throughout the procedure heart rate, rhythm electrocardiography, and peripheric O2 saturation were monitored with a non-invasive monitor, and blood pressure measurements were taken every 3 min. Rhythm Holter recordings were obtained from all patients and TEE was performed.", 
    "206": "When time domain parameters for HRV were compared in all three groups, the hypnosis group had significant increases in pNN50 and RMSSD compared to Groups D and T (p < 0.05). As concerns frequency domain parameters, there were no significant differences between groups where low frequency (LF) was decreased in hypnosis group and high frequency (HF) was increased (p > 0.05). However, LF/HF was decreased statistically significantly (p < 0.05) when compared with the midazolam group.", 
    "207": "Contrary to standard sedation in TEE patients, when hypnosis is used autonomic cardiac tone is modified to a significant extent. Hypnotic sedation achieves this by increasing the parasympathetic activity, decreasing the sympathetic activity, and changing the sympathovagal interaction balance.", 
    "208": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder with a high prevalence (10% in Caucasian populations). It is a purely clinical diagnosis characterized by an urge to move the lower limbs usually accompanied or caused by unpleasant sensations in the legs with an improvement in symptoms with movement. These sensations occur during inactivity or at rest and worsen in the evening or at night. RLS may not only impact the quality of life for an individual, but may also increase mortality. Disease markers such as genetic predispositions have been identified, as well as reduced iron stores with altered intracerebral iron homeostasis and dopaminergic dysfunction. Medication is often necessary in severe forms, with low doses of dopaminergic agonists being the first-line of treatment. The use of \u03b12\u03b4 ligands is an alternative. Finally benzodiazepines and opioid medications can be effective in refractory cases. In less severe forms of RLS, a non-pharmacological approach is usually sufficient with avoidance of stimulants and correction of contributing factors.", 
    "209": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of thiopental sodium with that of midazolam-ketamine on relieving agitation after tonsillectomy in children. In a clinical trial, 50 children aged 5-10 years, candidates for tonsillectomy, were randomly divided into two 25-member groups. In the first group, thiopental sodium 5mg/kg/IV, and in the second group combination of midazolam 0.01 mg/kg/IV and ketamine 1 mg/kg/IV were used to induce anesthesia. The level of sedation was assessed after surgery with the Ramsay scale. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of heart rate, arterial oxygen pressure (PO2), and duration of anesthesia. The Ramsay sedation score was significantly higher in the thiopental sodium group than in the midazolam-ketamine group (P=0.01). Thiopental sodium can be more effective than the combination of midazolam-ketamine for controlling agitation after tonsillectomy in children.",

At the maintenance of anesthesia O2/air and infusions of remifentanil and cisatracurium were used. In group P, propofol 6-10 mg kg(-1)h(-1) and in group M, midazolam 0.5 mg mg kg(-1) were preferred. Approximately 15 min before the wake-up test, all drugs were discontinued. At the wake-up test, anesthesiologist asked the patients to open their eyes and squeeze his/her hand at every 30s until the patients responded. Then patients were told to wiggle their toes. Hemodynamic parameters, time of eye-opening, appropriate movement upon verbal command were evaluated. BIS frequency throughout the operation was recorded.",

One thousand and forty-three patients in the psychiatric outpatient clinic of Tokyo Medical University Hospital receiving treatment with BZDs hypnotics were analyzed. The subjects answered questionnaires including demographic variables, subjective sleep difficulty assessed by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), duration of hypnotics medication, dose of diazepam equivalent BZDs hypnotics, the presence or absence of subjective side effects due to BZDs hypnotics (dizziness, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, amnesia, and headache), and dependency assessed by the Dependency 2-A (D 2-A) score. Subjects with a D 2-A score \u226510 were considered as having BZDs hypnotics dependence, and the variables associated with the presence of dependence were examined using logistic regression analyses. Eighty-two out of the 1043 subjects (7.9%) were determined to have BZDs hypnotics dependence. Compared with the non-dependence group, the dependence group had a significantly higher proportion of positive respondents for all the side effects. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the dependence was significantly associated with younger age, higher total PSQI score, and higher daily dose of BZDs hypnotics. Younger age, higher total PSQI score, and higher dose may be associated with BZDs hypnotics dependence. The finding that patients with BZDs hypnotics dependence frequently suffered from subjective side effects and had greater sleep difficulty encourages the establishment of alternative treatments for patients with insomnia symptoms refractory to BZDs hypnotics treatment.",

Moreover, available tools that guide dosing in neuropsychiatric pediatric patients are scant, leading to the possibility of reduced efficacy and/or increased risks of toxicity. Here we describe the results of observational therapeutic drug monitoring conducted in three pediatric neuropsychiatry units across Italy in 2012-2014, with the following aims: (1) to describe the distribution of plasma concentrations of second-generation antipsychotics in our pediatric patients and (2) to identify clinical covariates associated with plasma drug levels.",

In multiple regression analyses, risperidone plasma levels depended only on drug dose (p < 0.001). Aripiprazole plasma levels were similar to those described in adults (median 165.8 ng/ml) and were widely distributed, with an inter-patient variability of 81.1%, while the intra-patient variability was much lower (29.3%). Multiple regression analyses indicated that aripiprazole plasma levels were influenced by the daily doses (p < 0.001) and by the number of concomitant drugs (p < 0.01).",
