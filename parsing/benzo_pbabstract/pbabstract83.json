    "16": "Recently, environmental stimuli on different neurobiological events, via participation of distinct amygdalar (AMY) ORXergic fibers have aroused wide interests in view of their ability to modify neuronal linked stressful and physiological homeostatic conditions. Results of the present study indicate that ORXergic (ORX-A/B) circuits of the facultative hibernating golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) central AMY (CeA) and basolateral AMY (BlA) nuclei constitute major sites of feeding behaviors. Indeed, hamsters after treatment of BlA with ORX-A frequently ingested greater quantities of food as compared to controls, while ORX-B in CeA induced a very (p<0.001) great consumption of water. The same nuclei treated separately with either ORX-A or ORX-B \u00b1 the selective \u03b1(1) GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptor agonist (zolpidem) dedicated less time to eating and drinking sessions. Conversely, hamsters that received the same neuropeptides but this time with the glutamatergic agonist NMDA displayed greater hyperphagic effects above all for ORX-A. When behavioral changes were compared to the expression of the specific ORXergic receptor (ORX-2R), an up-/down-regulating pattern was detected in some limbic areas (AMY, hippocampus and hypothalamus) following treatment with ORX-A or ORX-B plus NMDA. Overall, indications deriving from this study strongly point to hamster BlA-enriched ORX-A fibers in combination with either inhibitory or excitatory signals as main targets of hyperphagic responses while CeA ORX-B activities in presence of these same neuronal signals predominantly induced drinking motivational behaviors. The distinct behavioral activities of these two neuropeptides may have useful clinical bearings toward psychiatric and sleeping disorders such as bulimia and narcolepsy.",

FDG AAA-to-background SUV(max) ratios correlated with the intensity of CD8 + ED1 staining (r = .76; P < .03). FCH AAA-to-background SUV(max) ratios correlated with the intensity of ED1 staining (r = .80; P < .03). 18F-DPA714 uptake was similar in AAAs and in normal aortas, both in vivo and ex vivo.", 
    "24": "In rat experimental AAA, characterized by an important aortic wall leukocytes activity, FDG-PET showed higher sensitivity than FCH-PET and 18F-DPA714-PET to detect activated leukocytes. This enhances potential interest of this tracer for prognostic evaluation of AAA in patients.",

    "26": "Asenapine is a new second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) approved in September 2010 by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of bipolar disorder. It was significantly more effective than placebo in acute mania or mixed episodes as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to mood stabilizers (lithium or valproate). Early improvement was seen at day-2 (significant difference with placebo) and was strongly associated with week-3 response and remission. These suggest that the observation of an early improvement in the first week may be clinically an useful tool for individual treatment adjustment during the early course of treatment. Post-hoc analyses of asenapine studies showed significantly better effects on improving depressive symptoms associated with manic symptoms, and physical health related quality of life dimensions as compared to placebo. Asenapine differs from the other SGAs by a good tolerability profile, in particular in terms of metabolic profile. However, it seems to have a significant though moderate link with the occurrence of sedation. This new tolerance profile greatly broadens the scope of SGAs and supports the view of some authors that the term SGA is now outdated. Other therapeutic perspectives of asenapine are being assessed, in particular in specific population (pediatric and elderly patients).",

    "46": "GABAergic inhibition in the amygdala is essential in regulating fear and anxiety. Although fast \"phasic\" inhibition arising through the activation of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) has been well described in the amygdala, much less is known about extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs mediating persistent or tonic inhibition and regulating neuronal excitability. Here, we recorded tonic currents in the basolateral (BLA) nucleus and the lateral (LA) nucleus of the amygdala. While all BLA principal cells expressed a robust GABAergic tonic current, only 70% of LA principal cells showed a tonic current. Immunohistochemical stainings revealed that the \u03b13 GABA(A)R subunit is expressed moderately in the LA and strongly throughout the BLA nucleus, where it is located mostly at extrasynaptic sites. In \u03b13 subunit KO mice, tonic currents are significantly reduced in BLA principal cells yet not in LA principal cells. Moreover, the \u03b13 GABA(A)R-selective benzodiazepine site agonist and anxiolytic compound TP003 increases tonic currents and dampens excitability markedly in wild-type BLA principal cells but fails to do so in \u03b13KO BLA cells. Interneurons of the LA and BLA nuclei also express a tonic current, but TP003-induced potentiation is seen in only a small fraction of these cells, suggesting that primarily other GABA(A)R variants underlie tonic inhibition in this cell type. Together, these studies demonstrate that \u03b13 GABA(A)R-mediated tonic inhibition is a central component of the inhibitory force in the amygdala and that tonically activated \u03b13 GABA(A)Rs present an important target for anxiolytic or fear-reducing compounds.",

Four groups of Wistar Han IGS rats were treated for 28 days with either OL (2 mg/kg twice daily, intraperitoneal (IP)), a combination of OL (2 mg/kg twice daily, IP) + extended-release NTX (50 mg/kg, one-time, intramuscular (IM)), extended-release NTX (50 mg/kg, one-time, IM) or vehicle and their food intake and body weight were measured daily for the first nine days and every other day thereafter. Food intake and BWG that were increased by OL were decreased by the added NTX while NTX alone had no significant effects on food intake or on BWG. Plasma leptin concentrations were significantly elevated in the three groups receiving pharmacological agents, but did not differ among each other, suggesting that changes in leptin secretion and/or clearance alone would not explain the food intake and the body weight findings. Our results extend prior reports on anorexigenic effects of opioid antagonists by demonstrating that such effects may generalize to food intake increases and BWG arising in the context of OL pharmacotherapy.",

Overdose of these drugs is common, and most of the hospital-treated patients are discharged within 24 to 48 hours. No previous studies have examined whether they have residual impairment at the time of discharge. Our aim was to evaluate whether patients with CNS-D overdose are impaired in cognitive domains important in daily activities at that time. We compared visuomotor skills (Trail-Making Test A and Choice Reaction Time), executive functions (viz attentional set-shifting: Trail-Making Test B; and planning: Stockings of Cambridge Task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery), working memory (Letter-Number Sequencing), and impulsivity and decision making (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Information Sampling) in 107 patients with CNS-D overdose (benzodiazepines, opioids, or antipsychotics) with a control group of 68 with non-CNS-D overdose (acetaminophen, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) on discharge from hospital. Outcome measures were adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates in multivariate regression models. Compared with the controls, patients in the CNS-D group were significantly impaired in all domains: they had prolonged Trail-Making completion times and reaction times, poorer working memory and planning and were more impulsive in decision making. Their Stockings of Cambridge Task performance was comparable to that of the control group for simple problems but worsened with increasing task complexity. The results show that patients with CNS-D overdose could be impaired in multiple cognitive domains underlying everyday functioning even at the time they are deemed medically fit to be discharged. Such impairments could adversely affect social and professional lives of this relatively young population during the immediate postdischarge period.",

This study was designed to compare long-term metabolic effects and efficacy of paliperidone extended release (ER) with those of oral olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia. In this 6-month, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group study, adults with schizophrenia were treated with paliperidone ER (6-9 mg/d; n = 239) or oral olanzapine (10-15 mg/d; n = 220). The primary outcome was mean change in the ratio of serum triglyceride level to high-density lipoprotein level (TG/HDL), a marker of insulin resistance. Other outcome measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, measures of lipid and glucose metabolism, and body weight. Significant improvements in psychotic symptoms were observed with both treatments (P < 0.0001). The TG/HDL ratio was significantly higher at end point versus baseline with olanzapine compared with that of paliperidone ER. Mean end point change in TG/HDL ratio was 0.97 \u00b1 2.72 [corrected] for olanzapine (P < 0.0001, reflecting worsening), with no significant change for paliperidone ER (-0.17 \u00b1 2.51). Newly diagnosed impairment in TG and metabolic syndrome was more common with olanzapine (P < 0.05). Insulin resistance, as measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, worsened significantly with olanzapine (P = 0.0003), but not with paliperidone ER. Glucose sensitivity for insulin worsened significantly with olanzapine (P < 0.03), with no significant changes for paliperidone ER. End point increase in body weight was significantly higher with olanzapine than paliperidone ER (3.8 vs 1.2 kg; P = 0.0013). In summary, both paliperidone ER and olanzapine effectively treated schizophrenia; however, undesirable metabolic effects were significantly greater with olanzapine.",

The onset of spontaneous seizures was heterogeneous, with an average latency of 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 days (range 3-36 days) to the initial status epilepticus. The frequency of late spontaneous seizures was higher in rats in which the initial status epilepticus was recurrent after its interruption with diazepam compared to rats in which this treatment was more efficient. Seizure-induced neuropathological changes were assessed in the subiculum by losses in NeuN-positive neurons and by Fluoro-Jade C staining of degenerating neurons. Neuronal loss was already prominent 24\u00a0h after KA injection and only modestly progressed at the later intervals. It was most severe in the proximal subiculum and in layer III of the medial entorhinal cortex and distinct Fluoro-Jade C labeling was observed there in 75% of rats even after 3 months. Glutamatergic neurons, labeled by in situ hybridization for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 followed a similar pattern of cell losses, except for the medial entorhinal cortex and the proximal subiculum that appeared more vulnerable. Glutamate decarboxylase65 (GAD65) mRNA expressing neurons were generally less vulnerable than glutamate neurons. Reactive astrocytes and microglia were present after 24\u00a0h, however, became prominent only after 8 days and remained high after 30 days. In the proximal subiculum, parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex the number of microglia cells was highest after 30 days. Although numbers of reactive astrocytes and microglia were reduced again after 3 months, they were still present in most rats. The time course of astrocyte and microglia proliferation parallels that of epileptogenesis.", 
    "61": "Pilocarpine-treated mice are an increasingly used model of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, outcomes of treatment can be disappointing, because many mice die or fail to develop status epilepticus. To improve animal welfare and outcomes of future experiments we analyzed results of previous pilocarpine treatments to identify factors that correlate with development of status epilepticus and survival. All treatments were performed by one investigator with mice of the FVB background strain. Results from 2413 mice were evaluated for effects of sex, age, body weight, and latency between administration of atropine methyl bromide and pilocarpine. All parameters correlated with effects on outcomes. Best results were obtained from male mice, 6-7 weeks old, and 21-25 g, with pilocarpine administered 18-30 min after atropine methyl bromide. In that group only 23% failed to develop status epilepticus, and 64% developed status epilepticus and survived. Those results are substantially better than that of the total sample in which 31% failed to develop status epilepticus and only 34% developed status epilepticus and survived.",

    "63": "The combination of electrochemistry (EC) and mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical tool for studying mechanisms of redox reactions, identification of products and intermediates, and online derivatization/recognition of analytes. This work reports a new coupling interface for EC/MS by employing nanospray desorption electrospray ionization, a recently developed ambient ionization method. We demonstrate online coupling of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization MS with a traditional electrochemical flow cell, in which the electrolyzed solution emanating from the cell is ionized by nanospray desorption electrospray ionization for MS analysis. Furthermore, we show first coupling of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization MS with an interdigitated array (IDA) electrode enabling chemical analysis of electrolyzed samples directly from electrode surfaces. Because of its inherent sensitivity, nanospray desorption electrospray ionization enables chemical analysis of small volumes and concentrations of sample solution. Specifically, good-quality signal of dopamine and its oxidized form, dopamine o-quinone, was obtained using 10 \u03bcL of 1 \u03bcM solution of dopamine on the IDA. Oxidation of dopamine, reduction of benzodiazepines, and electrochemical derivatization of thiol groups were used to demonstrate the performance of the technique. Our results show the potential of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization as a novel interface for electrochemical mass spectrometry research.", 
    "64": "Dried blood spots (DBS) sampling has gained popularity in the bioanalytical community as an alternative to conventional plasma sampling, as it provides numerous benefits in terms of sample collection and logistics. The aim of this work was to show that these advantages can be coupled with a simple and cost-effective sample pretreatment, with subsequent rapid LC-MS/MS analysis for quantitation of 15 benzodiazepines, six metabolites and three Z-drugs. For this purpose, a simplified offline procedure was developed that consisted of letting a 5-\u00b5l DBS infuse directly into 100 \u00b5l of MeOH, in a conventional LC vial.", 
    "65": "The parameters related to the DBS pretreatment, such as extraction time or internal standard addition, were investigated and optimized, demonstrating that passive infusion in a regular LC vial was sufficient to quantitatively extract the analytes of interest. The method was validated according to international criteria in the therapeutic concentration ranges of the selected compounds.", 
    "66": "The presented strategy proved to be efficient for the rapid analysis of the selected drugs. Indeed, the offline sample preparation was reduced to a minimum, using a small amount of organic solvent and consumables, without affecting the accuracy of the method. Thus, this approach enables simple and rapid DBS analysis, even when using a non-DBS-dedicated autosampler, while lowering the costs and environmental impact.",

    "71": "Of 35 endoscopists who responded, 17 (48.6%) used sedation for less than 25% of procedures, while 14 (40.0%) used sedation for more than 75% of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. The majority of respondents (22/35 or 62.9%) had less than 5 years experience in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The sedative of choice was benzodiazepine alone in the majority of respondents (85.7%). Opioid use (alone or in combination with benzodiazepines) was reported by only 5 respondents (14.3%). None of the respondents had had any experience with propofol. Non-anaesthesiologist-directed sedation was practiced by 91.4% of endoscopists. Monitoring of oxygen saturation during sedation was practiced by only 57.1% of respondents. Over half of the respondents (18/35 or 51.4%) never used supplemental oxygen for diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.",

    "73": "The tail suspension test (TST) is widely recognized as a useful experimental paradigm for assessing antidepressant activity and depression-like behavior. We have previously identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 46 (Usp46) as a quantitative trait gene responsible for decreasing immobility time in the TST in mice. This Usp46 mutation has a 3-bp deletion coding for lysine in the open reading frame, and we indicated that Usp46 is implicated in the regulation of the GABAergic system. However, it is not known precisely how the immobile behavior is regulated by the GABAergic system. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether the immobility time is influenced by drugs affecting the action mediated by GABA(A) receptor using both 3-bp deleted (the Usp46 mutant) and null Usp46 (Usp46 KO) mice. Nitrazepam, an agonist at the benzodiazepine-binding site of the GABA(A) receptor, which potentiates the action of GABA, produced a dose-dependent increase in TST immobility time in the Usp46 mutant mice without affecting general behaviors. The Usp46 KO mice exhibited short immobility times comparable to the Usp46 mutant mice, which was also increased by nitrazepam administration. The effects of nitrazepam in the Usp46 mutant and KO mice were antagonized by flumazenil. These results indicate that the 3-bp deleted Usp46 mutation causes a loss-of-function phenotype, and that the GABA(A) receptor might participate in the regulation of TST immobility time.", 
    "74": "Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile onset epileptic encephalopathy associated with mutations in the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit gene SCN1A. To date no large studies have systematically examined the prognostic, clinical and demographic features of the disease. We prospectively collected data on a UK cohort of individuals with Dravet syndrome during a 5-year study period and analysed demographic information based on UK population and birth figures. From structured referral data we examined a range of clinical characteristics including epilepsy phenotype, seizure precipitants, electroencephalography data, imaging studies, mutation class and response to medication. Predictors of developmental outcome were determined by logistic regression. We identified 241 cases with SCN1A mutation-positive Dravet syndrome, 207 of which were UK-based. The incidence of mutation-positive Dravet syndrome is at least 1:40\u2009900 UK births. Clinical features predicting a worse developmental outcome included status epilepticus (odds ratio\u2009=\u20093.1; confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.5-6.3; P\u2009=\u20090.003), interictal electroencephalography abnormalities in the first year of life (odds ratio\u2009=\u20095.7; confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.9-16.8; P\u2009=\u20090.002) and motor disorder (odds ratio\u2009=\u20093.3; confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.7-6.4; P\u2009<\u20090.001). No significant effect was seen for seizure precipitants, magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities or mutation class (truncating versus missense). Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging was documented in 11% of cases, principally with findings of non-specific brain atrophy or hippocampal changes. Sodium valproate, benzodiazepines and topiramate were reported as being the most helpful medications at the time of referral. Aggravation of seizures was reported for carbamazepine and lamotrigine. The identification of factors influencing prognosis both aids counselling and encourages early, syndrome-specific therapy.

Each patient underwent 2 consecutive full-night polysomnographic studies. The first night was the baseline night. Prior to the second night, 1 group received a single oral dose of 0.25mg pramipexole, whereas a second group received a single oral dose of 0.5mg clonazepam, and the remaining patients received placebo. Sleep stages, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), and leg movement activity were scored following standard criteria; symptoms of RLS were also assessed.",

Both drugs were effective on sensory RLS symptoms.", 
    "78": "This study demonstrates that a selective pharmacological approach can disconnect PLMS from arousal events, suggesting an indirect relation between each other. These results might weaken the hypothesis of a direct pathological role of PLMS in sleep disruption and can be important for the discussion on the existence of a distinct entity called periodic limb movements disorder. Moreover, the study opens the doors to the possibility of a joint treatment for RLS targeting sensory and motor symptoms, as well as sleep instability.", 
    "79": "NOTCH signaling is important for development and tissue homeostasis and is activated in many human cancers. We investigated a role for NOTCH1 signaling in S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS), a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in which CD4+ tumor cells (S\u00e9zary cells) are present in the skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. We show consistent expression of activated NOTCH1 by S\u00e9zary cells isolated from peripheral blood of SS patients, as well as the SS-derived cell lines SeAx and HuT78. In addition, immunohistochemical stainings of skin biopsies from SS patients showed consistent expression of nuclear NOTCH1 and its downstream target hairy/enhancer of split-1 (HES1) by S\u00e9zary cells. We demonstrate that this persistent NOTCH1 activation is not caused by mutations in the coding regions of NOTCH1 and F-box and WD40 domain protein 7 (FBWX7) genes. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling by gamma secretase inhibitors decreased cellular viability and induced apoptosis of S\u00e9zary cells. These observations argue that NOTCH1 signaling is functionally involved in the pathogenesis of SS, and inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling represents a new therapeutic target for the treatment of SS.", 
    "80": "Two quinolines identified as positive allosteric modulators of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors containing the \u03b1(2) subunit, 9-amino-2-cyclobutyl-5-(6-methoxy-2-methylpyridin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-one (4) and 9-amino-2-cyclobutyl-5-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-one (5), were radiolabelled at the methoxy position with carbon-11 (half-life=20.4 min). These quinolines represent a new class of potential radiotracers for imaging the benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). Both radiotracers were reliably isolated following reaction of their respective pyridinone/pyridinol tautomeric precursors with [(11)C]CH(3)I in clinically useful, formulated quantities (2.9% and 2.7% uncorrected radiochemical yield, respectively, relative to [(11)C]CO(2)) with high specific activities (>70 GBq \u03bc mol(-1); >2 Ci \u03bc mol(-1)) and high radiochemical purities (>95%). The radiosyntheses reported herein represent rare examples of selectively isolating radiolabelled compounds bearing [(11)C]2-methoxypyridine moieties. Although both radiotracers demonstrated promising imaging characteristics based on preliminary ex vivo biodistribution studies in conscious rodents, higher brain uptake was observed with [(11)C]5 and therefore this radiotracer was further evaluated. Carbon-11 labelled 5 readily penetrated the brain (>1 standard uptake value in cortical regions at 15 min post-injection of the radiotracer), had an appropriate regional brain distribution for GABA(A) receptors that appeared to be reversible, and did not show any appreciable radiometabolites in rat brain homogenates up to 15 min post-injection. Preadministration of flumazenil (1, 10 mg kg(-1)) or 5 (5 mg kg(-1)) effectively blocked >50% of [(11)C]5 binding to the GABA(A) receptor-rich regions, thereby suggesting that this radiotracer is worthy of further evaluation for imaging GABA(A) receptors. Additionally (R,S)-N-(1-(3-chloro-4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl)-3,3-diphenylpropan-1-amine, 6, an allosteric modulator of GABA(B) receptors, was efficiently labelled in one step using [(11)C]methyl iodide. Ex vivo biodistribution studies in conscious rats showed low brain uptake, therefore, efforts are underway to discover alternative radiotracers to image GABA(B). In conclusion, [(11)C]5 is worthy of further evaluation in higher species for imaging GABA(A) receptors in the central nervous system.", 
    "81": "Use of sleep medications as a result of hospitalization among older adults is common and has been shown to result in chronic use and increased risks for adverse effects such as falls and cognitive decline. However, few studies have explored in-hospital sleep medication use or disuse as a possible factor related to subsequent home use.",

    "83": "The study was designed as a prospective cohort study, and included 485 acute medical patients aged 70 years and older, hospitalized in a large, Israeli, teaching medical centre. Sleep medication use was assessed by patient interviews regarding patterns of use prior to, during and at 1 and 3 months after discharge. Post-discharge using patterns were assessed as a function of in-hospital discontinuation or initiation of sleep medications; background demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed as well. Logistic regressions were modelled separately for discontinuation and initiation of sleep medication use at each follow-up.", 
    "84": "Of those patients who used sleep medications prior to admission, 37 (18% of 206 prior users) discontinued use during the hospital stay. Non-use of sleep medications during hospitalization was the main significant characteristic associated with post-hospitalization discontinuation among prior users, when comparing patients who continued with those who discontinued using sleep medications in bivariate analyses. Discontinuation was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR, adjusted for cognitive status) of 3.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64, 9.30) for non-use at the 1-month follow-up. Of those who did not use sleep medications prior to admission, 39 (14% of 279 non-prior users) initiated use during hospitalization. Again, sleep medication initiation at time of hospitalization was the main correlate of change in post-hospitalization medication use status, when comparing post-discharge users and non-users, among the non-prior users. Hospital initiation of sleep medications was associated with an AOR (adjusted for levels of education and morbidity, readmission, and functional status) of 4.65 (95% CI 1.95, 11.09) for post-discharge use. Similar results were obtained for the 3-month follow-up, reaching significance levels only for the discontinuation group.", 
    "85": "Though overall prevalence rates of sleep medication use pre- and post-hospitalization are fairly similar, rigorous scrutiny of the findings demonstrates that in-hospital sleep medication use and disuse may be a significant turning point both for initiation and discontinuation of sleep medications, especially in the short post-discharge time frame. Thus, in-hospital sleep medication prescribing policies should acknowledge the potential for changes in the post-discharge sleep medication regimen.",

However, neuronal correlates of change related to food information processing have not been investigated with these medications. We studied the effect of a pharmacological manipulation with an antipsychotic known to cause weight gain on metabolites, cognitive tasks and neural correlates related to food regulation. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with a task requiring visual processing of appetitive stimuli in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls before and after 16 weeks of antipsychotic medication with olanzapine. In patients, the psychological and neuronal changes associated following the treatment correlated with appetite control measures and metabolite levels in fasting blood samples. After 16 weeks of olanzapine treatment, the patients gained weight, increased their waist circumference, had fewer positive schizophrenia symptoms, a reduced ghrelin plasma concentration and an increased concentration of triglycerides, insulin and leptin. In premotor area, somatosensory cortices as well as bilaterally in the fusiform gyri, the olanzapine treatment increased the neural activity related to appetitive information in schizophrenic patients to similar levels relative to healthy individuals. However, a higher increase in sensitivity to appetitive stimuli after the treatment was observed in insular cortices, amygdala and cerebellum in schizophrenic patients as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, these changes in neuronal activity correlated with changes in some metabolites and cognitive measurements related to appetite regulation.",

Polymorphic glucuronidation of olanzapine by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) was investigated retrospectively in patient samples taken for routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and in recombinant metabolic systems in vitro. Multivariate analyses revealed that patients who were heterozygous as well as those who were homozygous for the UGT1A4*3 allelic variant had significantly higher concentrations of the major metabolite olanzapine 10-N-glucuronide in serum (+38% (P = 0.011) and +246% (P < 0.001), respectively). This finding was in line with the significant increases in glucuronidation activity of olanzapine observed with recombinant UGT1A4.3 (Val-48) as compared with UGT1A4.1 (Leu-48) (1.3-fold difference, P < 0.001). By contrast, serum concentrations of the parent drug were not significantly influenced by UGT1A4 genotype. Our findings therefore indicate that UGT1A4-mediated metabolism is not a major contributor to interpatient variability in olanzapine levels. However, with respect to other drugs for which UGT1A4 has a dominant role in clearance, increased glucuronidation encoded by UGT1A4*3 might impact the risk for subtherapeutic drug exposure.", 
    "92": "Targeting Chk1 protein kinase can enhance the antitumor effects of radio- and chemotherapy. Recent evidence disclosed a role of Chk1 in unperturbed cell proliferation and survival, implying that Chk1 inhibitors could also be effective as single agents in tumors with a specific genetic background. To identify genes in synthetic lethality with Chk1, we did a high-throughput screening using a siRNA library directed against 719 human protein kinases in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-5, resistant to Chk1 inhibitors. Wee1 tyrosine kinase was the most significant gene in synthetic lethality with Chk1. Treatment with non-toxic concentrations of a Chk1 inhibitor (PF-00477736) and a Wee1 inhibitor (MK-1775) confirmed the marked synergistic effect in various human cancer cell lines (breast, ovarian, colon, prostate), independently of the p53 status. Detailed molecular analysis showed that the combination caused cancer cells to undergo premature mitosis before the end of DNA replication, with damaged DNA leading to cell death partly by apoptosis. In vivo treatment of mice bearing OVCAR-5 xenografts with the combination of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors led to greater tumor growth inhibition than with the inhibitors used as single agents with no toxicity. These data provide a strong rationale for the clinical investigation of the combination of a Chk1 and a Wee1 inhibitor.",

    "97": "We observed characteristic involuntary movements in premature babies during early infancy. These movements consisted of asymmetrical irregular banging of the extremities, similar to chorea, ballisms, or jitteriness. We investigated the clinical characteristics and neuroimaging findings of the patients with these peculiar involuntary movements to clarify their pathophysiological mechanisms and to find a treatment. In our sequential follow-up study on 90 premature infants with various pre-and perinatal brain insults, we found various types of cerebellar injuries in 28 patients. In 19 of these, the prominent injuries were observed in the inferior cerebellar hemispheres. These cerebellar injuries were often observed in patients born before the gestational age of 27 weeks. Fourteen of the 28 patients with cerebellar injuries displayed the above-mentioned characteristic involuntary movements. Twelve of these 14 patients with both cerebellar injury and involuntary movements were born before the gestational age of 27 weeks. On the contrary, 10 patients with cerebellar injury born after the gestational age of 27 weeks did not display these peculiar involuntary movements. It is noteworthy that cerebral injuries were not associated with the occurrence of these involuntary movements. Two patients with asymmetrical cerebellar deformity caused by compression due to a cystic lesion did not show these involuntary movements. The movements appeared around the corrected age of 3 months, and they disturbed the patients' acquisition of sitting ability. Nine patients with these involuntary movements developed severe athetotic cerebral palsy. These movements showed drug resistance, however, benzodiazepines had a partial effect in some patients. Recently, cerebellar injury in premature infants has received a lot of attention. We believe that the peculiar involuntary movements we observed in the present patient group may be caused by a particular type of cerebellar damage specific to premature infants born before 27 weeks of gestational age.",

The paranoid ideas of reference and the dereistic thinking could be the consequence of drug-induced psychosis. Within 24 hours after the intoxication was over delirium set in. The patient's history included only the use of MP4, use of other kinds of drugs was negated. The drug tests were negative, amphetamine derivates were not detectable in the urine sample. It is most likely that the MP4 pill contained an amount of MDPV less than detectable. In conclusion we suggest that the clinical picture could be the consequence of regular MDPV use.", 
    "103": "While our previous work suggests that the midazolam-induced memory impairment results from the inhibition of new association formation, little is known about the neural correlates underlying these effects beyond the effects of GABA agonists on the brain. We used arterial spin-labeling perfusion MRI to measure cerebral blood flow changes associated with the effects of midazolam on ability to learn arbitrary word-pairs. Using a double-blind, within-subject cross-over design, subjects studied word-pairs for a later cued-recall test while they were scanned. Lists of different word-pairs were studied both before and after an injection of either saline or midazolam. As expected, recall was severely impaired under midazolam. The contrast of MRI signal before and after midazolam administration revealed a decrease in CBF in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left cingulate gyrus and left posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus. These effects were observed even after controlling for any effect of injection. A strong correlation between the midazolam-induced changes in neural activity and memory performance was found in the left DLPFC. These findings provide converging evidence that this region plays a critical role in the formation of new associations and that low functioning of this region is associated with anterograde amnesia.",

Therefore, the current study investigated a possible relationship between peripheral adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A) and sensory gating indices (P50 measures) in medication-free schizophrenia (n=31) and healthy (n=21) groups. The effects of six-week antipsychotic treatment were examined. At baseline, schizophrenia patients showed impaired sensory gating compared to healthy controls. However, there was no significant difference in ADORA2A gene expression among groups. In addition, ADORA2A expression was not correlated with sensory gating at any time point. Following treatment, we found a significant upregulation of ADORA2A expression. Intriguingly, we observed a significant positive association between ADORA2A upregulation and baseline P50 amplitudes in the schizophrenia group. A main finding of the current pilot study is the upregulation of ADORA2A expression following treatment with antipsychotics. In addition, this upregulation was predicted by baseline P50 amplitude, an observation that awaits replication in an expanded sample.",

    "110": "We aimed to examine whether long-term use of benzodiazepines is associated with an accelerated decline of cognitive performances by using a statistical model specifically adapted to multivariate longitudinal bounded quantitative outcomes. The data came from the \"Three-city\" study, a French population based study. All the subjects were 65 years old or older at inclusion and had been followed-up for 7 years. The use of benzodiazepines and cognitive functioning were assessed at each examination phase (baseline, 2, 4 and 7 years). Cognitive decline was analyzed using a nonlinear multivariate mixed model with a latent process. This model makes it possible to assess change over time of the latent cognitive process underlying several neuropsychological tests: Mini Mental Status Examination, Isaacs Set test, Benton Visual Retention Test, and Trail Making Test (A and B), and to describe and account for their metrological properties. Analyses were adjusted for age, center, gender, education, socio-professional status, depression, insomnia, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol, tobacco consumption and physical activity. Nine hundred and sixty nine subjects who reported taking benzodiazepines for 2, 4 or 7 consecutive years were compared to 4226 subjects who were non-benzodiazepine users. Chronic use of benzodiazepine was significantly associated with a lower latent cognitive level (\u03b2=-1.79 SE=0.25 p=<0.001), but no association was found between chronic use and an acceleration of cognitive decline, neither on the latent cognitive process (\u03b2 \u00d7 time=0.010 SE=0.04 p=0.81), nor on specific neuropsychological tests. Our results suggest that chronic benzodiazepine use is associated with poorer cognitive performance but not with accelerated cognitive decline with age.", 
    "111": "Diazepam modulation of native \u03b32-containing GABA(A) (\u03b3GABA(A)) receptors increases channel conductance by facilitating protein interactions involving the \u03b32-subunit amphipathic (MA) region, which is found in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (Everitt et al., 2009). However, many drugs, predicted to act on different GABA(A) receptor subtypes, increase channel conductance leading us to hypothesize that conductance variation in GABA(A) receptors may be a general property, mediated by protein interactions involving the cytoplasmic MA stretch of amino acids. In this study we have tested this hypothesis by potentiating extrasynaptic GABA(A) currents with etomidate and examining the ability of peptides mimicking either the \u03b32- or \u03b4-subunit MA region to affect conductance. In inside-out hippocampal patches from newborn rats the general anesthetic etomidate potentiated GABA currents, producing either an increase in open probability and single-channel conductance or an increase in open probability, as described previously (Seymour et al., 2009). In patches displaying high conductance channels application of a \u03b4((392-422)) MA peptide, but not a scrambled version or the equivalent \u03b32((381-403)) MA peptide, reduced the potentiating effects of etomidate, significantly reducing single-channel conductance. In contrast, when GABA currents were potentiated by the \u03b32-specific drug diazepam the \u03b4 MA peptide had no effect. These data reveal that diazepam and etomidate potentiate different extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor subtypes but both drugs modulate conductance similarly. One interpretation of the data is that these drugs elicit potentiation through protein interactions and that the MA peptides compete with these interactions to disrupt this process.",

The principal intent of this work is to check binding domain and structural changes of human serum albumin (HSA), the primary carrier of flavonoids, in blood plasma association with hesperidin by employing molecular modeling, steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) methods. From molecular modeling simulations, subdomains IIA and IIIA, which correspond to Sudlow's sites I and II, respectively, were earmarked to possess affinity for hesperidin, but the affinity of site I with flavanone is greater than that of site II. This corroborates the site-specific probe and hydrophobic 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) displacement results placing the hesperidin at warfarin-azapropazone and indole-benzodiazepine sites. Steady state and time-resolved fluorescence manifested that static type, due to HSA-hesperidin complex formation (1.941 \u00d7 10(4) M(-1)), is the operative mechanism for the diminution in the tryptophan (Trp)-214 fluorescence. Moreover, via alterations in three-dimensional fluorescence and CD spectral properties, we can securely draw the conclusion that the polypeptide chain of HSA is partially destabilized after conjugation with hesperidin. We anticipate that this study can provide better knowledge of bioavailability such as absorption, biodistribution, and elimination, of hesperidin in vivo, to facilitate the comprehension of the biological responses to physiologically relevant flavanones.", 
    "136": "Oromucosal midazolam (Buccolam\u2122) is a benzodiazepine approved for the treatment of pediatric patients with acute, prolonged, convulsive seizures. This article reviews the pharmacologic properties of oromucosal midazolam and its clinical efficacy and tolerability for the treatment of prolonged acute convulsive seizures in pediatric patients aged 3 months to <18 years. Midazolam exerts its action by enhancing the effects of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, resulting in neural inhibition. Oromucosal midazolam has a rapid onset (<10 minutes; due to rapid absorption across the buccal membrane and high lipophilicity) and short duration of effect (categorized by the short elimination half-life of midazolam and its active metabolite). The oromucosal administration of the drug avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism; as a result, it has a higher bioavailability than oral midazolam. Oromucosal midazolam is at least as effective at seizure cessation as rectal or intravenous diazepam and appears as well tolerated as these diazepam formulations in pediatric patients with acute convulsive seizures (additionally, midazolam has been available for use for decades in various formulations, and is historically well tolerated). Moreover, oromucosal midazolam was associated with a similar or shorter time to response than rectal diazepam. While the time to response was longer with oromucosal midazolam than with intravenous diazepam, the latter took significantly longer to apply than the former, leading to a significantly shorter overall controlling time with oromucosal midazolam. Respiratory depression occurred at a similar rate in recipients of oromucosal midazolam to that observed in recipients of rectal diazepam. Overall, oromucosal midazolam is at least as effective as rectal diazepam and as effective as intravenous diazepam in the treatment of children with prolonged acute convulsive seizures, and is generally well tolerated in this population. It has several advantages over rectal diazepam, the previous gold standard of treatment, such as having a more socially acceptable administration route and having a likely more predictable absorption profile. Oromucosal midazolam is a promising first-line treatment option for children with prolonged acute convulsive seizures, in particular where intravenous access is precluded.",

Co-treatment of olanzapine with betahistine significantly prevented (-45%) weight gain and reduced feeding efficiency compared to sole olanzapine treatment. Betahistine treatment alone had no effect on weight gain and food intake. Olanzapine reduced locomotor activity, but not betahistine. These findings demonstrate that olanzapine-induced body weight gain can partially be reduced by co-treatment with betahistine. Betahistine has H\u2083 receptor antagonistic effects to increase histamine release, which may augment its direct agonistic effects on H\u2081 receptors. These findings have important implications for clinical trials using betahistine to control antipsychotic-induced obesity side effects.", 
    "166": "The efficacy of stiripentol (STP) in Dravet Syndrome (DS) was discovered first in an exploratory study in pediatric pharmacoresistant epilepsies. This efficacy signal, used as a proof of concept, led to - two independent multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in DS patients: STICLO-France and STICLO-Italy. In adjunction to valproate and clobazam, STP demonstrated marked efficacy and these trials became the basis for the registration of STP as an orphan drug for DS. Although STP had previously shown antiepileptic activity, since it inhibits cytochromes P450, the increased plasma levels of clobazam (CLB), norclobazam (NCLB), and NCLB/CLB ratio reported in STICLO studies brought into question the activity of STP per se. Recent pharmacological studies demonstrated that (i) STP is a direct allosteric modulator of the GABA receptors at a site distinct from benzodiazepines; (ii) STP and CLB/NCLB act independently at GABA(A) receptors; (iii) their combination increases the maximum response beyond that of either drug alone. All these effects are independent of considerations of changes in metabolism. Some responders in STICLO studies failed to display any increase of plasmatic concentrations of NCLB/CLB ratio as STP could not inhibit CYP2C19 because of its inhibition by progabide or due to an inactivating CYP polymorphism. The responder rate proved to be in the same range whether the NCLB/CLB ratio increased or not. These analyses confirmed that the effects of STP cannot result from a simple pharmacokinetic interaction. We propose that the success of STP should serve as a model for AED development in rare pediatric epileptic syndromes.", 
    "167": "Diazepam, a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand, is widely used as a therapeutic agent. On the other hand, peripheral-type benzodiazepines have been shown to induce apoptosis in different immune cell types. In this study, we examined the possible protective role of vitamin C in diazepam-induced apoptosis and evaluated the cellular content of glutathione during this process. Rat thymocytes were incubated for 24 hours with diazepam and increasing concentrations of vitamin C or with diazepam alone. The exposure to diazepam resulted in an increase in apoptotic cell death and decrease in glutathione content in rat thymocytes. Vitamin C was effective in ameliorating the effect of diazepam in rat thymocytes by decreasing the proportion of apoptotic cells and increasing the cellular content of glutathione. These results suggest that vitamin C reduced the diazepam-induced apoptosis in rat thymocytes by restoring the cellular content of glutathione, which may be useful in preventing the diazepam-induced immunosupression (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 31).",

Dementia, dehydration and polypharmacy are particularly strongly associated, in the elderly. A careful history and examination with appropriate investigation allows underlying causes to be detected and treated. Rehabilitation strategies should be initiated without delay.

The animals were orally administered CZZX (0.75, 1.5, and 3\u2009g/kg daily) for 10 days and tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM), Vogel conflict test (VCT), and open field. Repeated treatment with CZZX (3\u2009g/kg/day, p.o.) significantly increased the percentage of both entries into and time spent on the open arms of the EPM compared with saline controls. In the VCT, repeated treatment with CZZX (1.5 and 3\u2009g/kg/day, p.o.) significantly increased the number of punished licks. The drug did not change the total entries into the open arms of the EPM or interfere with water consumption or nociceptive threshold, discarding potential confounding factors in the two tests. In the open field, locomotion was not reduced, discarding the possible sedative effect of CZZX. In the binding assay, the binding of [(3)H] Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) to the benzodiazepine binding site in washed crude synaptosomal membranes from rat cerebral cortex was affected by CZZX. These data indicate an anxiolytic-like profile of action for CZZX without sedative side effects, and this activity may be mediated by benzodiazepine binding site modulation at \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A receptors.",

This study used statistical imaging analysis for IMZ-SPECT to investigate the relationship between higher brain dysfunction and cortical neuron loss in the medial frontal lobes, to establish a confirmatory diagnosis of higher brain dysfunction in patients with adult moyamoya disease. IMZ-SPECT was estimated by three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP). Cortical neuron loss was analyzed using the stereotactic extraction estimation (SEE) method (level 3: gyrus level) for 3D-SSP Z-score maps (Z-score >2). Extent of pixels with significant reduction of BZ receptor density within the target gyri (i.e. bilateral medial frontal gyri [MFGs] and anterior cingulate gyri [ACGs]) was calculated. In 6 patients with higher brain dysfunction, significant cortical neuron loss was observed in the bilateral MFGs in 4 patients, unilateral MFG in 1 patient, and bilateral ACGs in 2 patients. In 12 patients without higher brain dysfunction, no significant cortical neuron loss was observed in the bilateral MFGs or ACGs, and mild loss was observed in the bilateral MFGs in 2 patients, unilateral MFG in 4 patients, and unilateral ACG in 2 patients. Long-standing mild hemodynamic ischemia in the anterior circulation of patients with adult moyamoya disease could lead to incomplete brain infarction within the medial frontal lobes. Statistical imaging analysis using 3D-SSP and SEE methods for IMZ-SPECT could demonstrate significant cortical neuron loss in the bilateral frontal medial cortices involving MFG and/or ACG which correlate with higher brain dysfunction in patients with adult moyamoya disease.",

Diazepam had an anxiolytic effect in BALB/c mice, while in higher doses caused behavioural inactivity in 129P3 mice. MPEP revealed almost no anxiolytic effects on behaviour in both strains, but reduced stress-induced corticosterone responses only in 129P3 mice. These results were complemented by reduced expression of c-Fos after MPEP treatment in brain areas related to emotional processes, and increased c-Fos expression in higher integrating brain areas such as the prelimbic cortex compared to vehicle-treated 129P3 mice.",

    "192": "The atrioventricular node (AVN) is a vital component of the pacemaker-conduction system of the heart, co-ordinating conduction of electrical excitation from cardiac atria to ventricles and acting as a secondary pacemaker. The electrical behaviour of the AVN is modulated by vagal activity via activation of muscarinic potassium current, IKACh. However, it is not yet known if this response exhibits 'fade' or desensitization in the AVN, as established for the heart's primary pacemaker--the sinoatrial node. In this study, acute activation of IKACh in rabbit single AVN cells was investigated using whole-cell patch clamp at 37 \u00b0C. 0.1-1 \u03bcM acetylcholine (ACh) rapidly activated a robust IKACh in AVN myocytes during a descending voltage-ramp protocol. This response was inhibited by tertiapin-Q (TQ; 300 nM) and by the M2 muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist AFDX-116 (1 \u03bcM). During sustained ACh exposure the elicited IKACh exhibited bi-exponential fade (\u03c4f of 2.0 s and \u03c4s 76.9 s at -120 mV; 1 \u03bcM ACh). 10 nM ET-1 elicited a current similar to IKACh, which faded with a mono-exponential time-course (\u03c4 of 52.6 s at -120 mV). When ET-1 was applied following ACh, the ET-1 activated response was greatly attenuated, demonstrating that ACh could desensitize the response to ET-1. For neither ACh nor ET-1 was the rate of current fade dependent upon the initial response magnitude, which is inconsistent with K+ flux mediated changes in electrochemical driving force as the underlying mechanism. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TQ sensitive inwardly rectifying K+ current in cardiac AVN cells, elicited by M2 muscarinic receptor or ET-1 receptor activation, exhibits fade due to rapid desensitization.", 
    "193": "Abuse of the psychoactive \"designer drug\" methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) has become a serious international public health concern because of the severity of its physical and behavioral toxicities. MDPV is the primary ingredient in so-called \"bath salts,\" labeled as such to avoid criminal prosecution and has only been classified recently as a controlled substance in the United States and some other countries. However, it remains a danger because of illegal sources, including the Internet. MDPV is a synthetic, cathinone-derivative, central nervous system stimulant and is taken to produce a cocaine- or methamphetamine-like high. Administered via oral ingestion, nasal insufflation, smoking, intravenous or intramuscular methods, or the rectum, the intoxication lasts 6 to 8 hours and has high addictive potential. Overdoses are characterized by profound toxicities, causing increased attention by emergency department and law enforcement personnel. Physical manifestations range from tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias, hyperthermia, sweating, rhabdomyolysis, and seizures to those as severe as stroke, cerebral edema, cardiorespiratory collapse, myocardial infarction, and death. Behavioral effects include panic attacks, anxiety, agitation, severe paranoia, hallucinations, psychosis, suicidal ideation, self-mutilation, and behavior that is aggressive, violent, and self-destructive. Treatment is principally supportive and focuses on counteracting the sympathetic overstimulation, including sedation with intravenous benzodiazepines, seizure-prevention measures, intravenous fluids, close (eg, intensive care unit) monitoring, and restraints to prevent harm to self or others. Clinical presentation is often complicated by coingestion of other psychoactive substances that may alter the treatment approach. Clinicians need to be especially vigilant in that MDPV is not detected by routine drug screens and overdoses can be life-threatening.",

    "199": "Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly selective \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist, is the newest agent introduced for sedation in intensive care unit (ICU). The sedation strategy for critically ill patients has stressed light sedation with daily awakening and assessment for neurologic, cognitive, and respiratory functions, since Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines were presented in 2002. The traditional GABAergic agents, including benzodiazepines and propofol, have some limitations for safe sedatives in this setting, due to an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile and to detrimental adverse effects (such as lorazepam associated propylene glycol intoxication and propofol infusion syndrome). DEX produces it's sedative, analgesic and cardiovascular effects through \u03b1(2) receptors on the locus ceruleus (LC). Activities of LC, the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) are depressed and activity of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) is increased during DEX sedation, which is similar in features to normal non-REM (NREM) sleep. At the same time, perifornical orexinergic activity is maintained, which might be associated with attention. This mechanism of action produces a normal sleep-like, cooperative sedation. The characteristic feature of sedation, together with a concomitant opioid sparing effect, may decrease the length of time spent on a ventilator, length of stay in ICU, and prevalence and duration of delirium, as the evidence shown from several comparative studies. In addition, DEX has an excellent safety profile. In conclusion, DEX is considered as a promising agent optimized for sedation in ICU.",

In addition, all children received anesthesia cream (EMLA\u00ae) locally 1 h before i.v. access. Blood samples were drawn at 4 time points during 30 min after establishing venous access and, when feasible, after 24 h. The 24-hour sample was regarded as obtained during unstressed condition. The effect of procedural sedation was analyzed. Children's evaluations of pain (Numeric Rating Scale) and procedure (Likert Scale) were correlated with mean values of cortisol and glucose after i.v. access. For the metabolic and hormone control measurements, 60 children aged 4-18 years (40 obese and 20 GR) served as controls.

Correlations between the character of reorganizations of interzonal relations and subjective assessments of the drug effect were observed: activating and antianxiety drug effects were correlated with tolerability and the wish to continue treatment with the drug. Results suggest that drug effect on EEG spectra is more informative when subjective assessments are taken into account.",

It is tightly located (0.5 cM) close to the pink-eyed dilution (p) locus which encodes for fur color on mouse chromosome 7. We tested the putative role of the gabra5 gene in pharmacological properties of the full non specific agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP), using behavioral and molecular approaches in mutated p/p mice and wild type F2 from crosses between two multiple markers inbred strain ABP/Le and C57BL/6By strain. From our results, using rotarod, light-dark box, elevated maze and radial arm maze tests, we demonstrate that p/p mice are more sensitive than WT to the sensory motor, anxiolytic and amnesic effect of CDP. This is associated with the presence of a haplotypic block on the murine chromosome 7 and with an up regulation of gabra5 mRNAs in hippocampi of p/p F2 mice.", 
    "211": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) occurs in few young adolescents, but is as common as in adults by the late teens. To address problems with the current American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV criteria, the anticipated DSM-V will eliminate the distinction between substance abuse and dependence in favour of a single category. For adolescents, pharmacotherapy for AUD may target alcohol withdrawal symptoms, alcohol consumption reinforcement properties, craving or co-morbid mental disorders. While uncommon among adolescents, severe alcohol withdrawal may require the closely monitored application of benzodiazepines. Disulfiram alters alcohol metabolism and has been shown to increase abstinence in adolescents with AUD, but sufficient motivation to maintain abstinence is needed for this approach to be appropriate. Medications to reduce alcohol craving, including naltrexone and acamprosate, may also assist some adolescents in maintaining abstinence. Adolescents with AUD typically also have co-morbid mental disorders and problems with other substances. Co-morbid mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, may be addressed by pharmacotherapy. The potential for interactions between prescribed medications and alcohol or illicit substances necessitates patient education and monitoring. While there is a paucity of empirical information on the applicability of these pharmacotherapy approaches in adolescents, cautious application of these medications in selected cases in the context of systematic psychosocial interventions is warranted to promote abstinence and address associated problems.",

The action usually taken by the greatest number of GPs once they suspected PDM was to 'document it' (97.9%) followed closely by 'suggest an alternative drug' (96.7%) and 'refrain from prescribing the drug' (91.9%).", 
    "216": "PDM is an issue for GPs. The findings from this study have highlighted the need for further research into this concerning issue, specifically further quantification of the size of the problem in the New Zealand general population. There is also a need for the development and implementation of interventions to help minimise and better manage PDM in New Zealand.", 
    "217": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique with the potential to image and quantify receptors in vivo with high sensitivity. PET has been used extensively to study major neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and benzodiazepine in humans as well as proving to be a very powerful tool to accelerate development and assessment of existing and novel drugs. With the recent development of dedicated PET scanners for small animals, such as the microPET, it is now possible to perform functional imaging in small animals such as rodents at high resolution. This will allow the study of animal models of disease and longitudinal studies in these models to monitor disease progression or effect of treatment in the same animal. Furthermore, the complete pharmacokinetics of a drug as well as pharmacodynamic information can be obtained in a single animal. Thus, small animal imaging will significantly reduce the number of animals needed for this type of experiment as well as reducing the effect of inter-animal variation. Experimental protocols in small animal imaging potentially can be very labor intensive. In this chapter, we discuss methods and practical aspects related to this type of experiment using the microPET system.",

    "219": "Evidence now suggests that pharmacogenetics has a role in the effects of analgesic, sedative, beta-blocker, local anesthetic, antiemetic, and obstetric medications. Variants in the \u03bc opioid receptor gene change the analgesic effects of morphine. Additional opioids recently studied include remifentanil, methadone, tramadol, and codeine. Ibuprofen's clearance varies with CYP2C9*3 genotype. Midazolam is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4/CYP3A5 enzymes. Enzyme induction was found to be about 50% greater with CYP3A5*3 homozygous genotype. Variations in minimum alveolar concentrations of volatile anesthetics and subcutaneous lidocaine efficacy have been attributed in part to melanocortin-1 receptor variants. Metoprolol achieved different effects in patients with CYP2D6 and beta1-receptor polymorphisms. Genetic background of the beta2-receptor contributes to susceptibility for experiencing preterm labor. The Pharmacogenomics Research Network and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium are partnerships of researchers who are dedicated to elucidating how the genome contributes to an individual patient's medication responses.",

    "221": "The concentrations of zolpidem and zopiclone were determined in peripheral blood samples in two forensic materials collected over a 10-year period (2001-2010). The z-hypnotics were determined in venous blood from living subjects (impaired drivers) and in femoral blood from deceased persons (forensic autopsies), with the latter classified as intoxication or other causes of death. The z-hypnotics were determined in blood by capillary column gas chromatography (GC) with a nitrogen-phosphorous (N-P) detector after solvent extraction with n-butyl acetate. The analytical limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.02 mg/L for zopiclone and 0.05 mg/L for zolpidem and these have remained unchanged throughout the study. When death was attributed to drug intoxication (N=918), the median concentration of zopiclone in blood was 0.20 mg/L compared with 0.06 mg/L for other causes of death (N=1215) and 0.07 mg/L in traffic offenders (N=691) (p<0.001). Likewise, a higher median concentration (0.30 mg/L) was found in intoxication deaths involving zolpidem (N=357) compared with 0.13 mg/L for other causes of death (N=397) or 0.19 mg/L in impaired drivers (N=837) (p<0.001). Median concentration in blood of both z-hypnotics were appreciably higher in intoxication deaths when no other substances were identified; 0 70 mg/L (N=12) for zopiclone and 1.35 mg/L (N=12) for zolpidem. The median concentrations of z-hypnotics in blood decreased as the number of co-ingested substances increased for intoxication deaths but not other causes of death. The most prevalent co-ingested substances were ethanol in autopsy cases and diazepam in the motorists. This large compilation of forensic cases should prove useful when toxicologists are required to interpret concentrations of z-hypnotics in blood samples in relation to cause of death.", 
    "222": "Regulation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) in airway smooth muscle (ASM) is a key aspect of airway contractility and can be modulated by inflammation. Mitochondria have tremendous potential for buffering [Ca(2+)](cyt), helping prevent Ca(2+) overload, and modulating other intracellular events. Here, compartmentalization of mitochondria to different cellular regions may subserve different roles. In the present study, we examined the role of Ca(2+) buffering by mitochondria and mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport mechanisms in the regulation of [Ca(2+)](cyt) in enzymatically dissociated human ASM cells upon exposure to the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-13. Cells were loaded simultaneously with fluo-3 AM and rhod-2 AM, and [Ca(2+)](cyt) and mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](mito)) were measured, respectively, using real-time two-color fluorescence microscopy in both the perinuclear and distal, perimembranous regions of cells. Histamine induced a rapid increase in both [Ca(2+)](cyt) and [Ca(2+)](mito), with a significant delay in the mitochondrial response. Inhibition of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (1 \u03bcM CGP-37157) increased [Ca(2+)](mito) responses in perinuclear mitochondria but not distal mitochondria. Inhibition of the mitochondrial uniporter (1 \u03bcM Ru360) decreased [Ca(2+)](mito) responses in perinuclear and distal mitochondria. CGP-37157 and Ru360 significantly enhanced histamine-induced [Ca(2+)](cyt). TNF-\u03b1 and IL-13 both increased [Ca(2+)](cyt), which was associated with decreased [Ca(2+)](mito) in the case of TNF-\u03b1 but not IL-13. The effects of TNF-\u03b1 on both [Ca(2+)](cyt) and [Ca(2+)](mito) were affected by CGP-37157 but not by Ru360. Overall, these data demonstrate that in human ASM cells, mitochondria buffer [Ca(2+)](cyt) after agonist stimulation and its enhancement by inflammation. The differential regulation of [Ca(2+)](mito) in different parts of ASM cells may serve to locally regulate Ca(2+) fluxes from intracellular sources versus the plasma membrane as well as respond to differential energy demands at these sites. We propose that such differential mitochondrial regulation, and its disruption, may play a role in airway hyperreactivity in diseases such as asthma, where [Ca(2+)](cyt) is increased.", 
    "223": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on the GABA-induced current (I(GABA) and GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We found that melatonin rapidly and reversibly enhanced I(GABA) in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 949 \u03bcM. Melatonin markedly enhanced the peak amplitude of a subsaturating I(GABA) but not that of a saturating I(GABA). Interestingly, melatonin was effective only when GABA and melatonin were applied together. Furthermore, the effect of melatonin on I(GABA) was voltage-independent and did not change the ion selectivity of the GABA(A) receptor. The melatonin enhancement on I(GABA) can not be blocked by luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist, indicating that melatonin-induced I(GABA) enhancement was not via activation of its own membrane receptors. However, this enhancement may be mediated via high-affinity benzodiazepine sites as it was inhibited by the classical benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, suggesting an allosteric modulation of melatonin by binding to the sites of GABA(A) receptors. In addition, melatonin increased both amplitude and frequency of GABAergic mIPSCs, indicating that melatonin enhances GABAergic inhibitory transmission. Hence, our observation that melatonin has an enhancing effect on the GABAergic system may implicate a potential pathway for the neuroprotective effects of melatonin."
