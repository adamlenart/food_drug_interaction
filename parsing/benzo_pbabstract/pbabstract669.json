    "0": "[3H]Diazepam appears to bind specifically to a single, saturable, binding site located on rat brain membranes, with an affinity constant near 3 nM at pH 7.4. Specific binding constitutes more than 90% of total binding at 0 degrees and less than 10% of total binding at 37 degrees. Arrhenius plots suggest a sharp conformational change in the diazepam receptor near 18 degrees. Mitochondrial fractions from rat kidney, liver, and lung exhibit some [3H]diazepam binding that can be displaced by nonradioactive diazepam and several other benzodiazepines. However, Ro-4864, which is almost inactive in displacing [3H]diazepam from brain membranes, is extremely potent in displacing it from kidney mitochondria. Conversely, clonazepam, the most potent inhibitor of brain binding, is an extremely weak inhibitor of kidney binding. Furthermore, diazepam binding to kidney mitochondria has an affinity constantof 40 nM, about 15 times higher than that in brain. No specific diazepam binding was detected in intestine or skeletal muscle. Thus, specific [3H]diazepam binding to membranes appears to be restricted to brain, where it is unevenly distributed: the density of diazepam receptors is about five times higher in cortex (the highest density) than in pons-meddula (lowest density). Trypsin and chymotrypsin completely abolished specific [3H]diazepambinding in brain and kidney.", 
    "1": "The effect of a magnesia and alumina antacid suspension on the absorption of clorazepate dipotassium was studied in 15 normal healthy adult subjects who ingested a 15-mg dose of clorazepate alone or with single or multiple doses of antacid. The results of this three-period randomized complete crossover study showed a trend of initially slower absorption and lower peak nordiazepam plasma levels when administered with the antacid suspension. However, there were no significant differences among treatments in the extent of absorption as measured by the area under the plasma level-time curves. Clorazepate plasma levels were of relatively short duration and similar for all treatments. The urinary excretion pattern was likewise comparable with conjugated oxazepam, the major species measured. Plasma elimination half-lives of nordiazepam and clorazepate were not affected by the antacid treatments.", 
    "2": "Experiments conducted on rabbits confirmed that chlorpromazine potentiates the weak epileptogenic action of Amipaque (metrizamide). Chlorpromazine withdrawal for a period of 48 h suppresses this potentiating effect in the rabbit. Neuroleptic drugs should therefore be avoided in patients examined with Amipaque. In patients under chronic treatment, neuroleptics ought to be discontinued at least 48 h before examination with Amipaque. With the doses and methods used in the present study, diazepam was not as effective as phenobarbital in preventing epilepsy produced by Amipaque. When premidication is needed or when convulsions occur after Amipaque examinations, combined diazepam and phenobarbital therapy ought to be instituted in order to achieve the best control of epileptic reactions.", 
    "3": "The pharmacokinetics of diazepam and its biologically active major metabolite desmethyldiazepam were investigated under clinically relevant situations. Both drugs were measured in the different specimens (blood, plasma, urine, bile) by a specific and sensitive gas-liquid chromatographic assay. The pharmacokinetic data were analyzed by the digital computer program SAAM-25 according to the two compartment open model. In healthy subjects the elimination half-life (T1/2(beta))is dependent on the age of the individuals, which is caused by changes in the apparent volume of distribution. The strong plasma protein binding of 95 to 98 percent determines the low hepatic clearance of diazepam. Only neglible amounts of a dose are excreted unchanged with the bile and into the urine. After multiple dosing with diazepam its T1/2(beta) is prolonged, which is caused by a lowered clearance. Thereby also desmethyldiazepam accumulates, since it is eliminated about three times slower than its parent compound. In patients with dysfunction of the liver (cirrhosis, hepatitis) diazepam and desmethyldiazepam exhibit a prolonged T1/2(beta) and a reduced clearance and the lowered plasma protein binding causes a larger volume of distribution. Animal and in vitro experiments demonstrate, besides species dependent differences, that the elimination of diazepam can be impaired by the accumulating desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "4": "The authors have studied the effect of the suspension of chronic treatment with flurazepam and amobarbital on the operant behavior of rats that for the first time were in the presence of two fixed-interval discrimination schedules. With the sound discrimination schedule, the responses emitted by the treated animals had charactistics similar to those of control animals. With the temporal discrimination schedule, though it is not possible to distinguish between learning rates, modifications in the intensity of the effect (increases in lever pressing) indicate that, considering the doses, the action of flurazepam is slight and that of amobarbital clear and statistically significant.", 
    "5": "The effects of some central depressant drugs on amino acid-induced depolarization of motoneurons have been determined in the isolate hemisected frog spinal cord. Motoneuron depolarization was recorded from ventral roots and measurements were made in the presence or absence of procaine or tetrodotoxin to minimize indirect effects of both drugs and amino acids. Chlorpromazine (0.05-0.1 mM) and diazepam (0.5 mM) produced a similar differential pattern of depression of amino acid-induced depolarizations. Responses induced by L-homocysteate were markedly antagonized by these drugs, while responses to quisqualate were unaffected. L-Aspartate-induced responses were antagonized more than L-glutamate-induced responses. This pattern of antagonism resembles that previously described for Mg2+. In contrast, pentobarbital (0.1 or 0.3 mM), and the inhibitory amino acids GABA and beta-alanine (0.5-1.0 mM), depressed amino acid-induced responses in a more uniform manner. The differential effects observed with chlorpromazine and diazepam provide further support for the possibility that responses to excitant amino acids structurally related to L-glutamate may have different underlying mechanisms.", 
    "6": "From Jan. 1, 1976, all children's aspirin and paracetamol preparations were required to be presented either in child-resistant containers or in dark-tinted unit packaging. In two areas hospital admissions of children under 5 years for accidental ingestion of aspirin were monitored from 1974 to 1976 to assess the effectiveness of this measure. There was a highly significant fall in admissions for accidental salicylate poisoning (129 in 1975 to 48 in 1976, P less than 0-001). Admissions fell throughout 1976 as old stocks were used up. Further analysis of cases in one area suggests that the fall in admissions from accidental salicylate poisoning was due to the packaging of one preparation of junior aspirin in child-resistant containers.", 
    "7": "Effects of ID-540, a recently introduced benzodiazepine derivative, on the averaged photopalpebral reflex (PPR), subjective symptoms and serum levels of ID-540 and its principal metabolite, N-desmethyl-ID-540 following an oral dose of 0.5 mg were investigated in 4 healthy male Japanese students in their early twenties. Both the latencies of PPR, P1 and P2 latency, showed a prolongation and maximum level at 2-2.5 hours after administration and tended to decline thereafter to control levels. The serum concentration of ID-540 showed a peak level at 2 hours after dosing, then showed a decline at 4 hours. The N-desmethyl-ID-540 exhibited a slow, gradual rise in the serum over the first 4 hours and there was a tendency toward a continued rise even at 24 hours. These parameters were of striking resemblance in the time-course of changes after oral dosing. Thus the PPR test may be a useful means of determining the clinical effects of anxiolytic agents. ID-540 appears to be an agent with remarkable anxiolytic effects.", 
    "8": "Rats were engaged in a baseline activity of licking and their distraction to tone stimuli measured by an interruption in licking. Habituation, distraction to a stimulus change and dishabitiuation (the return of distraction to the original tone) were studied. Ethanol (0.4 and 0.8 g/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (7.5 mg/kg) produced significantly faster habituation, a result that cannot be attributed to changes in the baseline response rate, or to differences in the initial distraction to the tone. All groups showed 24 hr retention to the tone when they were tested in the same state in which they were habituated. There was transfer of habituation between drugged and undrugged states for rats injected with chlordiazepoxide, but rats habituated undrugged showed no retention if tested after injections of ethanol. Chlordiazepoxide impaired the specificity with which the physical parameters were coded, whereas ethanol improved the specificity of coding. Neither drug affected dishabituation.", 
    "9": "The influence of Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) on the anticoagulating activity of Phenprocoumon (Marcumar) was investigated in rats. It was found that this psychotropic drug influences neither the anticoagulating activity nor the normal prothrombin-time when it is applied alone or together with Phenprocoumon. However, the prothrombin-time is shortened when Chlordiazepoxide is withdrawn and the feeding of Phenprocoumon is continued.", 
    "10": "Preliminary administration of 2 mg/kg of diazepam eliminated the pyrogenic reaction and increased survival of rabbits following intravenous injection of cat blood to them. A study of physico-chemical properties of the blood by measurement of the ionization balance in thermal denaturing demonstrated that injection of heterogenous blood to rabbits and suspension of rabbit erythrocytes in cat plasma in vitro led to a sharp reduction of the rate of proton binding with plasma proteins in the presence of foreign erythrocytes. Preliminary administration of diazepam to rabbits, and diazepam addition to the cat plasma in vitro prevented such changes and promoted retention of normal blood properties. Addition of diazepam in a concentration of about 10--4 M to the heterogenous plasma decreased erythrocyte agglutination considerably.", 
    "11": "Psychotropic drugs are prescribed to modify human behavior but they have persistent central sedative activity which may become a troublesome side-effect. Alcohol is known to interact with psychotropes, often to potentiate their central effects. We have previously shown that residues of some hypnotic drugs persist in the body for up to a week after a single therapeutic dose and have demonstrated that alcohol decreases the elimination rate of methaqualone even when taken 2 or 3 days after the drug. We have therefore looked at the influence of alcohol on the residual effects of Mandrax and nitrazepam on three measurements of human performance. The study was a double-blind, 3-way, cross-over study in which the following treatments were used: drug + alcohol, drug + alcohol placebo, and drug placebo + alcohol. In each case the alcohol or alcohol placebo was given 1, 2, and 3 days after the drug or placebo. The subject's kinetic visual acuity was measured 40 minutes after the alcohol had been taken. This was followed by a Stroop test. Changes in mental state and arousal were measured by an 18-item visual analogue scale. An interaction between alcohol and Mandrax was apparent in the results obtained from the Stroop and visual analogue scale on the third day. However, no interaction with nitrazepam could be clearly demonstrated by any of the tests on any occasion. The application of these results to the \"real life\" situation is discussed.", 
    "12": "The synthesis of some pyrrolobenzodiazepine derivatives related to oxotomaymycin, an antibiotic recovered together with tomaymycin from fermentation broths of Streptomyces achromogenes var. tomaymycetics, is described. Reaction between 2-nitro-4-benzyloxy-5-methoxybenzylbromide and pyrrole-2-carboxyaldehyde afforded 1-(2-nitro-4-benzyloxy-5-methoxybenzyl)pyrrole-2-carboxyaldehyde. Catalytic reduction of this compound with hydrogen in the presence of Pd/C gave 10,11-dihydro-8-hydroxy-7-methoxy-5H-pyrrolo[2.1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine. Amides obtained from condensation between 2-nitro-4-benzyloxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid chloride and proline or hydroxyproline were reduced catalytically to 2,3-dihydro-8-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1H-pyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11 (10H, 11aH)-dione and its 2-hydroxyderivative respectively. The synthesis of 10,11-dihydro-8-hydroxy-9-methoxy-5-pyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine is also reported.", 
    "13": "A 10 mg dose of diazepam was given intravenously to mothers at 15 to 205 minutes before delivery, and plasma diazepam concentrations were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in mothers and infants at delivery and again 24 hours later. The plasma levels in the infants were always significantly higher than in the mothers but there was no evidence to suggest that the newborn were unable to metabolize the drug. All infants had a good Apgar score at birth.", 
    "14": "The effects of sodium thiopentone 19-757 mumol/litre, sodium pentobarbitone 25-806 mumol/litre, propanidid 74-1186 mumol/litre, Althesin 55-220 mumol/litre, diazepam 17.6-140 mumol/litre and ketamine 1.8-116.8 mumol/litre on the time-course of miniature end-plate currents of the excised mouse diaphragm were investigated. The currents were detected by means of extracellular electrodes and recorded with a transient recorder. The drugs had no significant effect on the growth phase of the current, but all six shortened the time-constant of the decay phase. This reduction in the duration of end-plate currents reduced the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials. A similar effect at central synapses may account for a failure of synaptic transmission caused by anaesthetic drugs and it is suggested that a reduction in the lifetime of open postsynaptic ionic channels is a common action of anaesthetic drugs.", 
    "15": "Admission thyroid function tests were reviewed in 115 euthyroid patients with depression (66), depression and alcohol abuse (30), or alcohol abuse (19). Estimated free thyroxine (EFT) levels ranged from 0.7 to 2.7 ng/100 ml (normal, 1.0 to 2.1). Levels above 2.1 ng/100 ml were associated with agitation and values under 1.1 with alcohol abuse. Mean EFT levels differed significantly among six diagnostic subgroups and paralleled rank order for severity of depression (none, secondary, reactive, single uncategorized, recurrent, psychotic). Alcohol abuse negatively affected EFT: there was a significant decrease of mean EFT level from nonabusers to abusers and, further, to intoxicated abusers. A positive association between EFT level and severity of depression, and a negative one with alcohol use, were significant when other variables considered were controlled. These two factors accounted from 28.2% of variability in EFT levels, with a minimal additional contribution of medication effect.", 
    "16": "Clinical features were studied in 83 patients with slow spike-wave activity in the EEG. Epileptic seizures, usually intractable, occurred in 82 patients. The majority had the onset of seizures during the first 2 years of life. Minor motor seizures alone or in combination with other types of seizures occurred in 80 percent, and most had more than one type of seizure. The combination of tonic-clonic, minor motor, and absence seizures was the commonest, occurring in 37 percent. Sixty-six patients were definitely retarded and 49 showed definite motor impairment. Etiologic factors responsible for cerebral insult were identified in 53 patients. Serial EEG studies showed a close relationship between the EEG patterns of hypsarrhythmia, independent multifocal spike discharges, and slow spike-wave activity. The eponym \"Lennox-Gastaut\" syndrome is appropriate for a patient who has slow spike-wave activity in the EEG, exhibits mental retardation, and has intractable seizures of various types. However, the syndrome does not imply a pathologic entity because many diverse processes, both static and progressive, can produce this syndrome.", 
    "17": "Four pharmacologic differences among the benzodiazepines, which are the drugs of choice to conduct alcohol withdrawal, guide selection of the appropriate one: chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, or chlorazepate. Bases for selection include: (1) availability of other than oral dosage forms; (2) differences in additive effect with alcohol in producing central nervous system depression; (3) differences in anticonvulsant effect; and (4) differences in duration of effect in the body (ie, half-life). Decreasing dosage schedules are preferred to a steady dosage. Illustrative dosage schedules for using chlordiazepoxide and diazepam to conduct alcohol withdrawal are given.", 
    "18": "As early as 1971, it was noted that smoking marijuana lowered intraocular pressure. In this study one of the active components of marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, was given intravenously to ten subjects with normal intraocular pressures. Two strengths were used--0.022 mg/kg of body weight and 0.044 mg/kg of body weight. Intraocular pressure was found to decrease as much as 51% of baseline normal with an average decrease of 37%. Heart rate increased in a range of 22% and 65% of the resting pulse. Respiratory rate was not affected. No analgesic properties were demonstrated by either cutaneous or periosteal stimulation. Anxiety levels were increased by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol over placebo and diazepam (Valium). The mechanism of action is still uncertain but it is believed by some workers to be similar to that of a beta-adrenergic stimulator.", 
    "19": "THE CEREBELLUM CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS: the cerebellar nuclei whose connections to the various parts of the central nervous system coordinate muscle movements, and the cerebellar cortex which exerts an inhibitory influence on the cerebellar nuclei through the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gammaAbu) from Purkinje cells. The activity of Purkinje cells is regulated by two excitatory inputs to the cerebellar cortex-the climbing and mossy fibers-and by a neuronal network within the cortex which inhibits the activity of Purkinje cells through the release of gammaAbu from interneurons. The net activity of Purkinje cells is related to their content of guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) which increases or decreases according to changes in the activity of climbing and mossy fibers as well as to changes in the activation of gammaAbu receptors. When these receptors are activated, the cGMP of Purkinje cells decreases; when they are inhibited, the cGMP increases.The cGMP content of the cerebellar cortex is altered by drugs that change either the excitatory input of climbing or mossy fibers or the inhibitory input mediated by the activation of gammaAbu receptors. Mechanisms by which various drugs alter the cerebellar content of cGMP were investigated. By using various experimental designs, it was shown that diazepam and muscimol lowered the cGMP content by activating gammaAbu receptors. In contrast, morphine and haloperidol lowered the cerebellar cortex cGMP by decreasing the excitation of mossy fibers whereas harmaline increased the cGMP by increasing the excitation of the climbing fibers.", 
    "20": "Social contact behaviour induced by spreading cortical depression was studied in rats. The controls looked for and remained in contact, whereas between the rats with spreading cortical depression and their other partners there was no contact. This phenomenon is due mainly to the absence of an active urge for contact. The contact behaviour of rats is evidently controlled by the cerebral cortex or by subcortical areas of the brain which are inhibited after the elicitation of spreading depression. The experiments show that the contact behaviour of rats has at least two components - an active urge for contact and passive tolerance of contact.", 
    "21": "The effects of stress (intraperitoneal injections onece daily for three days), diazepam (Faustan, Germed) and polyethylene glycol (Macrogolum, Spofa) on the corticosterone production rate (BPR) and concurrent changes in serum corticosterone levels (BSL) were investigated in 4-day-old male rats. Stress stimulation increased the BSL but the BPR was affected only slightly and the difference was not statistically significant. A low dose of diazepam (1 mg/kg) prevented the stress-induced rise in BSL and decrease of BPR, in comparison to stressed animals. On the contrary, high doses of diazepam (10 mg/kg) increased the BSL, while BPR corresponded to control values. Polyethylene glycol (0.12 g/kg; substance of this class is contained in the diazepam vehiculum) decreased the BSL, but the BPR was increased above control values; a higher dose of this substance (1.2 g/kg) yielded only scattered, non-significant results. It is concluded that in preweaned animals 1. the changes in BSL may be associated with minor or transient changes in BPR which indicate small changes in brainpituitary adrenocorticotropic activity, 2. changes in peripheral corticosterone metabolism can play an exceptionally important role in the regulation of glucocorticoid activity in very young rats, 3. a comparison of controls with stressed animals which had received low doses of diazepam indicate a relatively high steady state activity of adrenal cortex and its regulation in 4-day-old control rats.", 
    "22": "Mass spectra and gas chromatographic data are presented for flurazepam and its metabolites; monodesethylflurazepam, didesethylflurazepam, hydroxyethylflurazepam, N1-desalkylflurazepam, N1-desalkyl-3-hydroxy-flurazepam, and flurazepam-N1-acetic acid. The on-column thermal degradation of didesethylflurazepam, N1-desalkyl-3-hydroxyflurazepam and flurazepam-N1-acetic acid is reported and discussed. Mass spectrometric and gas chromatographic data are also presented for the benzophenones obtained by acid hydrolysis of flurazepam and its metabolites. The occurrence of flurazepam metabolites in urine from five forensic cases after various treatments has been investigated. A possible new 'metabolite' of flurazepam was detected in two of these cases.", 
    "23": "Data from a continuous recording of drug prescriptions to 16,600 individuals in the county of J\u00e4mtland, Sweden, revealed that 2,566 patients (15.5%) obtained prescriptions for hypnotics, sedatives and minor tranquillizers in 1970. Occasional use (one purchase only, Group A) was seen in 7.4% of the population, intermediate use (two to six purchases, Group B) in 6.9% whereas 1.2% were regular users (seven purchases or more, Group C). For each group as a whole there was 5 years later a highly significant intraindividual reduction in the purchases of these drugs as well as of other psychotropic drugs. In all groups 10-23% had increased their purchases, most of them insignificantly. Fifteen of 30 patients with a marked increase in consumption developed a regular purchase pattern, but signs of overuse or abuse were seen in only four persons. During the studied period the benzodiazepines increased their share of the total from 45 to 60%. Antihistamines also increased in all groups while the proportion of barbiturates and combined preparations decreased markedly.", 
    "24": "The synthesis and CNS activity of a noval class of annelated 1,4-benzodiazepines, the aminomethylene-2,4-dihydro-1H-imidazo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepines, are described. An investigation of the structure--activity relationships in the series derived from 8-chloro-2,4-dihydro-2-dimethylaminomethylene-6-phenyl-1H-imidazo[1,2-a][1,4]-benzodiazepin-1-one (10) led to the synthesis of a group of compounds with potent minor tranquillizer activity.", 
    "25": "A simple, rapid and sensitive method is described for the analysis of unchanged benzodiazepine drugs and their metabolites, in human and animal tissues, using the proteolytic enzyme subtilisin Carlsberg followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography. The enzymic digestion yields far higher recoveries than conventional extraction methods, while the liquid chromatogrpahic analysis allows the rapid separation and detection of nanogram quantities of these drugs without the need for elaborate \"clean-up\" procedures.", 
    "26": "Fifteen healthy male volunteers received long-term daily treatment with oral lorazepam at doses as high as 10 mg per day for a period of 26 weeks. Steady-state plasma concentrations of lorazepam and its glucuronide metabolite were measured in all subjects at least every two weeks. At daily doses of 6 mg per day, the mean steady-state lorazepam level was 88 ng/ml and that of lorazepam glucuronide was 170 ng/ml. Mean levels among seven subjects who received 10 mg per day were 164 and 266 ng/ml, respectively. Lorazepam concentrations fluctuated from week to week despite constant dosage, but there was no evidence of systematic variation. Mean steady-state lorazepam levels were highly correlated with daily dose in mg/kg, but were not related to age. Lorazepam was not detected in any plasma samples drawn one week after discontinuation of treatment.", 
    "27": "Four healthy male volunteers received 5 mg lorazepam as a single intravenous injection. Concentrations of lorazepam and its glucuronide metabolite were determined in multiple venous blood samples drawn during the 48 hours after dosing and in all urine collected during 96 hours after the dose. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for lorazepam were: apparent elimination half-life, 13.2 hours; volume of distribution, 0.84 liter/kg; total clearance, 55.3 ml/min. Lorazepam glucuronide, the major metabolic product of lorazepam, promptly appeared in blood, reached peak levels within 6 hours of the dose, then declined in parallel with the parent compound. A mean of 69 per cent of the dose was recovered in urine as lorazepam glucuronide.", 
    "28": "The metabolism of flurazepam-5-14C has been studied in man following catheterization of the portal and hepatic veins. Flurazepam was administered through a tube into the stomach in one patient and into the duodenum in two patients. Thin-layer chromatographs of portal vein blood showed that there was a rapid and early appearance of metabolites of flurazepam consistent with the metabolism of the flurazepam by the intestinal mucosa and at times when the concentrations in the hepatic vein and peripheral blood were very much lower than those in the portal vein. The major metabolites identified in portal vein blood were the mono- and didesetyl metabolies of flurazepam. Considerable hepatic uptake of flurazepam and its metabolites occurred, as evidenced by the lower concentrations of the parent compound and metabolites in the hepatic vein. Thus, \"first-pass\" metabolism of flurazepam following oral administration occurs in the small bowel mucosa of man as well as in the liver.", 
    "29": "A nonblind clinical study was carried out by administering Lorazepam at a low dosage to patients with a light to moderate state of reactive anxiety. The drug was shown to be effective in the management of the target symptoms studied: anorexia, sleep induction, rhythm, and duration disturbances, depression, irritability and moodiness, fatigue, anxiety and tension, somatic anxiety, social adaptation. The results obtained are practically identical to those reported in the literature for higher doses. Moreover, low-dose Lorazepam was well tolerated and without undesired side-effects.", 
    "30": "A rapid gas-liquid chromatographic technique has been developed for use in the simultaneous measurement of both diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, in blood plasma. Neither solvent transfer nor evaporation steps are required in this procedure. Extremely small plasma volumes (20 to 100 microleter) are used and this has proved advantageous, especially when analysing samples from neonates. A linear response to amounts from 1-10(-12) to 1-10(-9) g/sec of both diazepam and desmethyldiazepam has been obtained and thus the direct analyses of these compounds both during therapy and after overdosage has been possible. Interference from either endogenous or exogenous sources has been found to be minimal.", 
    "31": "Intracerebral (i.c.) injection of serotonin (5-HT) into mice induced head twitches in a dose-dependent manner at 10 min after injection. The head twitches induced by 5-HT (i.c.) were potentiated by the pretreatment of isocarboxazid (3 mg/kg i.p.), and inhibited by cyproheptadine (0.3 mg/kg i.p.), a 5-HT antagonist. Benzodiazepines such as fludiazepam and diazepam potentiated the head twitches induced by 5-HT (i.c.) in a dose-dependent manner. Mescaline (50 mg/kg i.p.) also induced head twitches in mice at 15 and 30 min after injection. Benzodiazepines potentiated the head twitches induced by mescaline in a dose-dependent manner. Cyproheptadine blocked the potentiating effect of benzodiazepines on the head twitches induced by both 5-HT (i.c.) and mescaline. By repeated administration of fludiazepam or diazepam for 5 days, the potentiating effect of both drugs on the head twitches induced by mescaline was unchanged and their anticonvulsant effects were not modified. In contrast, the potency of both drugs on muscle relaxation was significantly decreased by repeated administration. Benzodiazepines failed to change the uptake of 5-HT into the synaptosomal fractions from the rat brain. These results suggest that the pharmacological action of benzodiazepines is derived at least in part from their activating effect on 5-HT receptors.", 
    "32": "Dipotassium chlorazepate was administered to 12 healthy volunteers (8 males and 4 females), aged 22-38 years, as a single daily dose of 20 mg for 14 days. Plasma concentrations of N-desmethyldiazepam were monitored with a gas-chromatographic method during the medication period and for 5 days after withdrawal of the drug. The plasma half-life (t1/2), the elimination coefficient (Kbeta), the concentration (Css), and the apparent volume of distribution (Vbeta) were calculated at steady state, and the mean values +/- SEM were 53 +/- 6 h, 0.0147 +/- 0.0013 h-1, 884 +/- 73 ng/ml, and 1.13 +/- 0.08 1/kg, respectively. A moderate interindividual variability was observed regarding these parameters. There was no tendency toward a biexponential elimination. A significant difference in the apparent volume of distribution was found when males and females were compared.", 
    "33": "In healthy Labrador dogs a single intramuscular injection of benzoctamin, diazepam and pethidin leads to a distinct increase in serum-creatine-phosphokinase (SCK) activity, whilst a single intramuscular injection of physiologic saline has no effect whatsoever. Intravenous injection of an identical dose of the above-mentioned drugs leaves SCK activity unchanged. Muscle specimens of the injection site, excised 5 days after intramuscular injection of the same drugs, display muscle cell necrosis, macrophage proliferation and reparative changes. The impressive histological alterations point to the striated muscle cell as a probable source of the increase in SCK activity (MM fraction).", 
    "34": "delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was compared with diphenylhydantoin (DPH), phenobarbital (PB) and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) using two electroshock procedures to determine anticonvulsant activity in mice, i.e., electroshock seizure threshold (EST) and the reduced EST caused by hyponatremia (injection of isotonic glucose). Using doses of each drug which were ineffective against MES, only CDP (10.0 mg/kg) was able to raise the EST by 20%. The lowered EST due to hyponatremia was reveresed by al four drugs. In these tests latency to convulsions and lethality associated with electroshock were more sensitive to THC.", 
    "35": "A number of central nervous system acting drugs were administered to male rats. At certain time intervals after the administration of these drugs, the rats were sacrificed. Liver and brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities were determined. The drugs employed were: ethyl alcohol, cognac, hexobarbital, diazepam, imipramine and chloralose. Results obtained indicated that the liver MAO activity was not altered by any of these drugs. Brain MAO activity, contrary to in vitro studies, was increased by alcohol and cognac. The increase was not due to a direct effect of alcohol on the enzyme activity, since the in vitro addition of equivalent concentrations of alcohol, as those calculated to be present in vivo, to brain homogenates resulted in a decrease rather than an increase in activity.", 
    "36": "Nitrasepam is transformed to amino and acetamide derivatives in the rat intestine. Reduction of nitrasepam and its following acetylation in the duodenum and small intestine are catalyzed by the mucosal enzymes. In the cecum and the large intestine these processes are mediated through the action of the microbes and tissue enzymes, whereas in the rectum--through the microbes only.", 
    "37": "1. 2-(5-Cyano-N-methyl-3,5-dimethyl-3-aza-pentanamido)-5-nitrobenzophenone, administered orally to the rat, is well absorbed and extensively metabolized with only minimal quantities of parent compound detected in plasma, bile or urine. 2. Urinary t.l.c. metabolite profiles after oral administration of a substituted aminoacetamidobenzophenone, [14C]C 72 0045, and [14C]nimetazepam were qualitatively similar but differed quantitatively. 3. Analysis by t.l.c. of plasma extracts obtained after oral administration of [14C]C 72 0045 demonstrated that nimetazepam and nitrazepam accounted for 20% of the plasma total radioactivity. Nimetazepam and nitrazepam had a combined concentration up to 22 times greater than the concentration of C 72 0045. 4. The presence of nimetazepam in plasma after oral administration of C 72 0045 was confirmed by mass spectrometry. 5. In the liver, [14C]C 72 0045 was rapidly metabolized to polar metabolites. In the same rats, the major brain metabolites were nimetazepam and nitrazepam. 6. It is concluded that [14C]C 72 0045 undergoes metabolic cyclization in the rat to form nimetazepam, which is further metabolized to form nitrazepam.", 
    "38": "An analytical procedure was developed for the determination of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and their major metabolites in blood or plasma. Demoxepam, a metabolite of chlordiazepoxide, is determined by spectrofluorometry after extraction. The remaining compounds are determined by spectrophotodensitometry after thin-layer chromatographic separation. The sensitivity limit of the spectrofluorometric determination of demoxepam is 0.1 to 0.2 microgram while that of the spectrophotodensitometric determination of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and their N-desmethyl metabolites is 0.05 to 0.2 microgram. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay renders it suitable for monitoring plasma levels of chlordiazepoxide and its major metabolites following single or chronic oral administration of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride. The sensitivity limit for diazepam and nordiazepam, its major metabolite, renders the assay useful only for the determination of plasma concentrations resulting from high dosage of diazepam. The assay was used to determine chlordiazepoxide and its metabolites following oral administration of Librium. The data showed a significant correlation to those obtained on the same specimens by differential pulse polarography and by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "39": "Vein graft flow (VGF) in response to peripheral venous administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or diazepam was studied in 13 anesthetized patients following cardiopulmonary bypass for aortocoronary vein bypass graft operations. SNP (0.5 microgram/kg/min) significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05). VGF paralleled the decreased blood pressure, but the reduction was not significant (p greater than 0.05). Diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) did not significantly alter blood pressure or VGF. We conclude that peripheral venous administration of SNP or diazepam is not a pharmacologically reliable method by which to increase VGF in the period immediately following a graft operation.", 
    "40": "A combined cholestatic-hepatocellular injury and noncaseating granulomas occurred in two patients 1 and 4 weeks after phenylbutazone therapy. Both patients were jaundiced, one had a macular rash, and both had peripheral blood eosinophilia. Symptoms and signs subsided, and abnormal findings from tests of hepatic function rapidly returned to normal following withdrawal of the drug. Sections of liver biopsy specimens 6 months later showed no granulomas or other pathologic changes. Previously reported cases are reviewed.", 
    "41": "A series of 1-R-5-alkoxy-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-ones was prepared and evaluated for central nervous system depressant activity. Several of these compounds, in particular, 7-chloro-5-ethoxy-1-methyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one (2), gave a profile and activity level similar to diazepam when measured in mice."
