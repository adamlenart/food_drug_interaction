    "0": "Panic disorder, comprising also agoraphobia for the purpose of this review, has a prevalence of 1.2-8.4 per cent, affecting females twice as frequently as males, and has a mean age of onset of 25. It is one of the more familial diseases in Psychiatry in that 2/3 of cases have relatives affected with the same condition, and the risk to first degree relatives is approximately 3-4 times the rate of the general population. Although some family studies have suggested an overlap in the transmission of panic disorders and depression, and a common diathesis hypothesis has been proposed, depression is more common in the families of depressives, as in panic disorder in the families of probands with panic disorder. Twin studies of anxiety disorders, although limited in number, report a 30-40 per cent concordance among MZ twins, against 0-4 per cent among DZ twins, which supports a genetic predisposition. The mode of transmission is uncertain. Studies which have used the 'ancestral pairs' method (which examines the incidence of the condition in maternal versus paternal forebears, on the assumption that single locus transmission is favored by unilateral clustering, and polygenic theories are favored by a more even spread) have favored single locus transmission, although such unilateral clustering can still be accommodated within a multifactorial-polygenic hypothesis. Potential biological markers for the condition are reviewed. The observation that lactate infusion can precipitate panic attacks in predisposed individuals is well established. The association with mitral valve prolapse suggests that perhaps 38 per cent of patients presenting with symptoms of panic disorders have mitral valve prolapse on echocardiography. The possibility of an endogenous anxiety-producing agent that binds to the benzodiazepine receptor is discussed.", 
    "1": "In an open, single centre, general practice study, the short acting benzodiazepine lormetazepam (Loramet) was administered nightly for a period of 7 nights to fifty-eight geriatric insomniacs. All patients took 0.5 mg on the first night but were allowed to increase their dosage to 1.0 mg and 1.5 mg as required. The patients assessed the efficacy and acceptability of lormetazepam with the aid of a diary card completed on each morning of the study. The results showed that 65.5% of the patients reported an improvement in their sleep pattern and 76.9% were taking the 0.5 mg dosage by the last night of the study. Throughout the study there was a progressive increase in the mean duration of sleep and a similar increase in the number of patients awaking refreshed. The effects were significant after the second and third nights, respectively. Three patients withdrew from the study, two due to lack of efficacy and one dropped out following the occurrence of side-effects. It was concluded that the results confirm the efficacy and acceptability of lormetazepam and may suggest 0.5 mg to be a more suitable dosage than 1.0 and 1.5 mg in elderly patients.", 
    "2": "Four patients with severe addiction to sedative-hypnotics and with acute withdrawal symptoms of these drugs are described. They developed latent confusional states with characteristic EEG patterns (bilateral slow and sharp waves of high amplitude). Following small doses of benzodiazepines the EEG became normal together with a reduction in the clinical symptoms. It is suggested that the confusional states were of an epileptic nature.", 
    "3": "The study of in vivo occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors in rat hippocampus and cerebellum indicates that premazepam reaches only about 70% and 80% occupancy respectively within the dose range used for pharmacological tests in rats. Moreover, at equiactive doses (antileptazol ED50), more brain receptors are occupied by premazepam than by other benzodiazepines, suggesting that premazepam may act as a partial agonist at benzodiazepine receptors, with intrinsic activity lower in cerebellum than in hippocampus. These results may explain the lack of sedative and ataxic properties of premazepam.", 
    "4": "The contribution of differential absorption-distribution pharmacokinetics to drug activity can be partially determined by comparing simultaneous estimates of drug serum level with pharmacodynamic effects. In the present paper we have contrasted the effects of clinically equipotent doses of lorazepam, alprazolam, and diazepam on the performance of tracking and digit symbol substitution tasks. Eight young males were tested for 12 h after ingesting the drug. The three benzodiazepines and placebo were administered to each subject according to a balanced double-blind Latin square design. A model is presented that describes the relationship between drug concentration and the degree of impairment across time after the final peak effect. Exponential rate constants were determined for each drug using a Marquardt nonlinear fit of the pooled data. Basically, the constants relate offset serum drug values to the impairment curves at a time when serum-brain equilibrium is assumed to have occurred. The values indicate markedly rapid acute tolerance for alprazolam and diazepam but relatively little acute tolerance for lorazepam. Whether these constants reflect adaptation or differential association-dissociation receptor rate constants cannot be determined, but they do highlight the need to consider receptor kinetics as an important factor in benzodiazepine pharmacodynamics.", 
    "5": "Two methods were used to test rats' responses to novelty in the T-maze: (1) a test of spontaneous alternation allowing separate measurement of place and body turn alternation; and (2) a test of entry into an arm of changed brightness (\"response to stimulus change\"). Chlordiazepoxide reduced spontaneous alternation by specifically weakening body turn alternation and eliminated the response to stimulus change. These findings are similar to those previously reported for the barbiturate sodium amylobarbitone. The same pattern of change in the two tests was seen after a low dose of the GABAA agonist muscimol (0.00125 mg/kg); when the dose of muscimol was raised (0.01 and 0.25 mg/kg), place alternation was also reduced. Picrotoxin but not bicuculline (both GABAA blockers) reversed the effects of muscimol and partially those of chlordiazepoxide on the response to stimulus change; in the spontaneous alternation test picrotoxin only marginally affected the response to 0.25 mg/kg muscimol and actually enhanced the effect of 0.000125 mg/kg. The GABAB agonist baclofen (1 mg/kg) acted in the test of response to stimulus change like chlordiazepoxide and muscimol; however, when baclofen was combined with muscimol, the two drugs tended to show mutual blocking. These results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that GABAergic mechanisms play a role in anxiolytic behavioural activity, but many details are difficult to explain.", 
    "6": "5-Methoxy-, ethoxy- and phenoxycarbonyl derivatives of 2-methyl-4-phenyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepine-2-carboxylic ethyl ester (1) and 4-methyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepine-2-one (2) were obtained. 5-Methoxycarbonyl- (3) and 5-phenoxycarbonyl- (5) derivatives of 1 exerted analgesic action in doses of 0.1 LD50. Compounds 3, 5 and 7 a (5-ethoxycarbonyl-) in a dose as low as 0.063 LD50, and compound 8 (5-phenoxycarbonyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-one)--in a dose of 0.004 LD50 prolonged hexobarbital sleeping time. The toxicity of all the compounds was low.", 
    "7": "The behavioural, physiological and pharmacological validation of one animal test of anxiety, the social interaction test, is described in detail. The effects of anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs, and manipulations of catecholaminergic and serotonergic pathways are considered. The test is able to distinguish anxiolytic from sedative effects and is not sensitive to the actions of antidepressants or neuroleptics.", 
    "8": "This study is a survey of psychotropic drug use patterns among 934 elderly patients admitted to the Padua Geriatric Hospital. 34% of the patients took psychotropic drugs during their stay in hospital. The drugs most commonly used are anxiolytics and hypnotics of the benzodiazepine class. Women subjects living alone, and to a lesser extent those suffering from particular disorders, as of the central nervous system and the musculoskeletal apparatus, seem to be at higher risk in the use of psychotropic drugs. Moreover, the results show that psychotropic drugs are prescribed during the stay in hospital and even on discharge to a high percentage of subjects who did not use such drugs before admission to the hospital.", 
    "9": "Hydroxylated metabolites of diazepam can be conjugated and are therefore generally thought not to affect the metabolism of diazepam. Liver microsomes, obtained from phenobarbital-pretreated rats, showed an inhibition of diazepam (10(-5) M) metabolism by desmethyldiazepam as well as by N-methyloxazepam or oxazepam (5 X 10(-5) M). In a single-pass perfusion of the rat liver an inhibition of diazepam disposition by exogenously administered desmethyldiazepam and by hydroxylated diazepam metabolites was also demonstrated. No oxazepam glucuronides were found after oxazepam infusion. However, infusion with N-methyloxazepam resulted in large amounts of oxazepam-glucuronides. The results indicate that administration of N-demethylated as well as hydroxylated metabolites may result in inhibition of the metabolism of their precursor. If hydroxylated metabolites are formed in situ they become more easily conjugated in comparison with administered hydroxylated metabolites and are therefore less effective as inhibitor.", 
    "10": "A double-blind, multi-centre study was carried out in general practice to compare the efficacy and tolerance of treatment with bromazepam and lorazepam in 671 patients with anxiety. Patients were treated at random with either bromazepam (3 to 9 mg per day) or lorazepam (1 to 3 mg per day) for periods up to 2 weeks. In the doctors' global assessment of response, significantly more patients improved on bromazepam (84%) compared with lorazepam (77%). Thirty-three percent of the bromazepam patients reported at least one unwanted event compared with 37% in the lorazepam group. The results are discussed in the context of improving the benefit-risk ratio.", 
    "11": "The authors confirm the validity of a method of detection for 18 benzodiazepines. Its original feature consists of the extraction in an acid medium. Between 70 and 100 per cent of the drug is recovered, except for the benzophenones which are strongly basic. The yield of hydrolysis is between 70 and 95 per cent, except for diazepam and lormetazepam, for which the yield is about 50 per cent. Depending on the nature of the benzodiazepines, the limit of detection of the process described is between 5 and 20 micrograms/l of urine. Following a single therapeutic dose in non-dependent volunteers, the benzodiazepines were detectable for at least 36 to 48 hours.", 
    "12": "The newly synthesized compound and putative 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin, but not the structurally related compound R 56413, resembles pirenperone in that it acts as a pure antagonist in an LSD-saline drug discrimination assay in the rat. Ritanserin exceeded pirenperone in terms of behavioral specificity; the lowest effective dose of ritanserin in antagonizing LSD was one order of magnitude higher than that of pirenperone, but the compound depressed rate of operant responding only at doses that were about 1000-fold higher than those at which pirenperone was effective. Ritanserin exerted effects in an open field test which were reminiscent of anxiolytic drug activity in the rat; its effects were greater than those of pirenperone, R 56413 and the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. The results of experiments on antagonism of 5-HT-induced hypothermia and of the 5-HTP-induced head-twitch response fail to support the possibility that the putative anxiolytic effects of ritanserin in the rat can be ascribed simply to a pharmacologically defined action at 5-HT receptors.", 
    "13": "This study investigated whether benzodiazepines reduce the capacity of animals to wait for food reward. Rats trained in a T-maze were allowed to choose between two magnitudes of reward: immediate, but small (two pellets) vs delayed, but large (eight pellets). The rats learned within ten sessions to select (80-100%) the arm leading to the largest reward. Separate groups of rats were then confined for 15, 30 or 60 s in the arm associated with the largest reward before gaining access to the spacially contiguous goal-box. The choice of the other arm was not followed by a period of waiting. Under these conditions, the frequency with which the small-reward arm was chosen increased linearly as a function of the duration of the waiting period. Diazepam (2-4 mg/kg IP) dose-dependently increased the number of times the small-reward arm was chosen during the sessions for which the waiting period was fixed at 15 or 30 s. Nitrazepam (2 mg/kg IP), chlordiazepoxide (16 mg/kg IP) and clobazam (16 mg/kg IP) had similar effects. The action of diazepam was counteracted by simultaneous administration of flumazepil (Ro 15-1788, 8 mg/kg PO). In the absence of confinement, these benzodiazepines, diazepam (4 mg/kg) excepted, did not modify selection of the large-reward arm. Conversely, the serotonin uptake blockers indalpine (2-4 mg/kg IP) and zimelidine (8-16 mg/kg IP) dose-dependently increased preference for the arm leading to the delayed (25 s) but large reward. These results suggest that benzodiazepines, perhaps by increasing impulsivity, render the animals less prone than controls to tolerate delayed access to reward.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Dopamine (DA) sensitivity, assessed through maximal growth hormone (GH) response to stimulation by apomorphine (APO) (0.18-0.24 mg iv) was studied in 16 chronic alcoholics newly admitted after a period of heavy alcohol intake. Repeated hormonal tests were thereafter performed during a 2-month period under strictly controlled conditions to avoid relapse into alcohol consumption. Eight healthy volunteers with alcohol consumption slightly less than that of the general population were used as controls. It was found that DA sensitivity in the early abstinence phase was higher than later in the 2-month recovery period but not significantly different from control values. The relatively higher DA sensitivity in the early abstinence phase might be responsible for a lower threshold for psychotic symptoms and neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects. The results of this study give further evidence of a prolonged recovery phase after heavy alcohol intake.", 
    "15": "One hundred patients undergoing treatment for alcohol-related problems in Kuwait's only psychiatric hospital were studied. Eighty-three Kuwaitis and 17 non-Kuwaitis (78 inpatients and 22 outpatients) were compared on two variables, i.e. nationality and drinking category. Kuwaiti patients were more likely to be violent while drunk and to receive benzodiazepine prescriptions while non-Kuwaiti patients were better educated and suffered more alcohol withdrawal seizures. Heavy drinkers were prescribed more benzodiazepines. Light drinkers were involved in more road accidents and were more likely to be prescribed major tranquillizers. The relationship between benzodiazepines use and alcohol withdrawal symptoms is discussed and its implications in patient care in Kuwait are stressed.", 
    "16": "Reduction in acid secretion in atrophic gastritis allows bacterial colonization of the stomach, most extremely in achlorhydric patients with pernicious anaemia, in whom overgrowth may cause nitrate reduction and formation of potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. Subsequent bacterial contamination of the upper small intestine can induce mucosal damage and malabsorption. The situation is similar after gastrectomy. In achlorhydria and after gastrectomy, the risk of gastric cancer is increased. There is controversy as to the risks of long-term treatment with H2-receptor antagonists. Increase in nitrate-reducing bacteria, nitrite and N-nitrosamine have been observed in patients by some investigators but not in volunteers and patients by others. Bacterial concentrations after cimetidine are inversely related to pretreatment acid secretory capacity. Demonstration of increased mutagenicity of gastric juice after H2-receptor antagonists gives grounds for caution. Drastic acid reduction may in future be reserved for short-term and intermittent treatment and mild or moderate reduction for long-term treatment of peptic ulcer and ulcer prevention.", 
    "17": "Duodenal ulceration is presumed to be induced and maintained by imbalance between aggressive and defensive factors. Development of drugs for correction of this imbalance has recently concentrated on maximum inhibition of acid secretion e.g. via H2-receptor antagonists but has led to re-evaluation of antacids and antimuscarinics. It has been shown that about the same percentage of ulcers can be healed using low antacid doses or antimuscarinics (e.g. pirenzepine) or doses of H2-receptor antagonists which do not inhibit acid secretion maximally as can be healed using higher doses of H2-receptor antagonists. Avoidance of the intragastric bacterial overgrowth and its consequences and the disturbance of the acid-gastrin feedback mechanism which may follow maximum gastric acid suppression could provide a rationale for use of anti-ulcer therapy based on moderate reduction of gastric acid secretion.", 
    "18": "Rats were trained to press a bar for sucrose reward on a random-interval (RI) schedule and footshock punishment was then introduced for 3-min intrusion periods (signalled by a tone) on an independent RI schedule. Shock intensity was individually adjusted to produce stable intermediate levels of response suppression during the tone for each animal. Groups of animals were then allocated to a number of separate experiments in which they were systemically injected with anxiolytics (chlordiazepoxide HCl or sodium amylobarbitone), GABA antagonists (picrotoxin or bicuculline), the GABA (A) agonist muscimol, the GABA(B) agonist baclofen, an antagonist (RO 15-1788) at the benzodiazepine receptor and, an inverse agonist (FG 7142) at this receptor. The results showed that the alleviation of punishment-induced suppression of barpressing produced by chlordiazepoxide was blocked or partially blocked by RO 15-1788, picrotoxin and bicuculline but not by FG 7142; that picrotoxin (but not FG 7142) increased the suppression of responding by punishment; that neither muscimol nor baclofen affected responding on their own, but their combination weakly but reliably released punished responding from suppression; and that the anti-punishment effect of amylobarbitone was unaffected by either picrotoxin or bicuculline, though the barbiturate reversed the punishment-enhancing effect of picrotoxin. These results are discussed in the light of the hypothesis that anxiolytic behavioural effects are due to increased GABAergic inhibition.", 
    "19": "Spontaneous locomotor activity was investigated in rats treated with chlordiazepoxide (CDP) or CL 218,872, a synthetic nonbenzodiazepine ligand for benzodiazepine receptors. Acute administration of CDP (2.5 mg/kg) increased activity, whereas a higher dose (10 mg/kg) decreased activity. Acute injection of CL 218,872 (2.5-10 mg/kg) produced a significant dose-dependent suppression of locomotor activity, a finding at variance with a previous report that anxiolytic doses of CL 218,872 are devoid of depressant side effects. Chronic pretreatment with CDP or CL 218,872 (10 mg/kg daily for 6 days) produced a tolerance to the sedative effect of CDP (10 mg/kg), but not to the activity suppressant action of CL 218,872 (10 mg/kg).", 
    "20": "Six beta-carboline ligands at central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors were tested for their anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties in mice in the four-plate test. ZK 93 423 and ZK 91 296 increased activity which had been suppressed by punishment (1 mA, 60 ms footshock) at doses which exerted no effect on unpunished locomotion. ZK 93 426, ZK 90 886, FG 7142, and DMCM exerted no antipunishment activity themselves, and antagonized the ability of diazepam to increase both punished and unpunished locomotor activity. DMCM, FG 7142, and ZK 90 886, but not ZK 93 426, also enhanced the ability of a reduced level of footshock (0.3 mA) to suppress activity. This propunishment activity of DMCM and ZK 90 886 took place at doses which had no effect on unpunished locomotion. The nature of the effect of the individual beta-carbolines on punishment was related to the nature of their interaction with the BZ/GABA receptor/chloride channel complex (GBC complex). Thus the antipunishment properties of ZK 93 423 and ZK 91 296 were associated with their ability to increase binding of 35S-t-butylbicyclo-phosphorothionate (TBPS) to its binding site associated with the chloride channel, whereas DMCM, FG 7142 and ZK 90 886, which exerted propunishment effects, reduced TBPS binding. ZK 93 426, which was neutral with respect to punished activity, had the weakest effect on TBPS binding. These results are discussed in the context of a possible role of GBC complex in anxiety.", 
    "21": "A study has been made of the action of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the radio-sodium efflux from single barnacle muscle fibres. (i) Stimulation of the Na efflux by external application of 5-HT is seen in both unpoisoned and ouabain-poisoned fibres. (ii) Concentrations of 5-HT as low as 10(-9)M are effective. (iii) Characteristically, the response to 5-HT is prompt in onset, reaches a peak within 20 min and then decays rather rapidly. Fibres from certain barnacle specimens are sometimes unresponsive to 5-HT. Such fibres, however, can be rendered responsive by preinjecting into them the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, Gpp(NH)p. The response of the ouabain-insensitive Na efflux to 5-HT depends on external Ca2+ and, to a certain extent, on external Na+. (i) The response to 5-HT is unaffected by prior external application of Ca2+ antagonists, viz. verapamil, Cd2+ and WB-4101. (ii) The calmodulin antagonist, trifluoperazine (10(-5)M), completely abolishes the response to 5-HT, even in fibres preinjected with Gpp(NH)p. (iii) Diphenylhydantoin is less effective than trifluoperazine (TFP). Whereas the receptor antagonist methysergide is ineffective, cyproheptadine is very effective. (i) Prior application of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 1-propyl-3-methyl-7-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-xanthine (PMX) or the inhibitor 1-isoamyl-3-isobutyl-xanthine (IAX) augments the size of the response to 5-HT, but fails to stop the response from decaying. (ii) Augmentation of the response to 5-HT by IAX is seen despite the presence of 10(-5) M-TFP. Prior injection of Mg2+ or protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) leads to abolition or reduction of the response to 5-HT. These results demonstrate that barnacle fibres are a useful preparation for investigation the natriferic action of 5-HT. They also support the view that the response to 5-HT involves a receptor-adenylate cyclase complex and is the result of activation by newly formed cAMP of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.", 
    "22": "A number of studies have found that the peri-natal exposure of rodents to diazepam alters their adult behaviour. Adult male mice, treated with diazepam or appropriate controls during pregnancy, were examined in terms of their ability to learn a radial maze. Those animals receiving diazepam prior, but not after birth, learnt the maze significantly more rapidly. The results are discussed in terms of the possible involvement of the hippocampus in this influence of diazepam.", 
    "23": "Anti-ulcer and sedative effects of tranquillosedatives viz. benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam and nitrazepam), barbiturate (phenobarbitone), phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine and thioridazine) and butyrophenone (haloperidol) were compared in albino rats. Ulceration of the glandular stomach was induced by 2 h restraint at 4 degrees C. Sedation was measured using the rotarod test. These tranquillosedatives showed dose dependent anti-ulcer and sedative effects. The relative potency and therapeutic index (ratio between rotarod ED50 and anti-ulcer ED50) of each drug were determined. Diazepam showed the highest therapeutic index (1.88). Diazepam significantly reduced the volume of gastric secretion, raised its pH and prevented the gastric ulcer formation in pylorus ligated rats but failed to prevent the acute duodenal ulceration induced by intramuscular injection of histamine or carbachol in guinea-pigs and rats, respectively. These observations suggest that benzodiazepines (diazepam) are more suitable anti-ulcer agents compared to barbiturate, phenothiazines and butyrophenone. The anti-ulcer effect of diazepam is possibly due to a combination of sedative, anti-anxiety and antisecretory actions.", 
    "24": "An experimental and clinico-pharmacological study of sodium valproate, a GABA-ergic drug, was conducted to elucidate the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the mechanisms responsible for affective disturbances, in particular for anxiety. A tranquilizing effect of the drug, comparable with the action of diazepam, was established in a conflict situation model in experimental animals. Using clinico-psychological methods the authors showed a distinct tranquilizing action of valproate in patients suffering from neurotic and neurosis-like disorders with manifestations of anxiety in the structure of the psychopathological syndrome. It was established that this action was accompanied by no manifestations of myorelexation, ataxia or somnolence characteristic of tranquilizers of the benzodiazepine series. The presence of tranquilizing properties in the GABA-ergic drug sodium valproate confirms the suggestion that a certain relationship exists between the GABA system and anxiety.", 
    "25": "Nonabine is a chromenol structurally related to the cannabinoids which has shown antiemetic efficacy in clinical trials. Oral doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg were given to healthy volunteers in a crossover study with the benzodiazepine ketazolam, 30 and 45 mg. Ketazolam produced sedative effects, with decreased quantitative EEG alpha activity and increased beta activity. Nonabine also produced sedative clinical effects, but with an EEG profile which resembled that reportedly caused by cannabinoids. In contrast to cannabinoids, nonabine did not cause changes of mood or perception, suggesting that nonabine lacks the potential for social abuse at antiemetic doses.", 
    "26": "The effects of CL 218,872, initially classified as a non-sedative anxiolytic, were investigated and compared with those of chlordiazepoxide in the holeboard. The ability of two drugs that antagonise the effects of benzodiazepines, CGS 8216 and Ro 15-1788, to reverse the effects of CL 218,872 and chlordiazepoxide were also investigated, to see whether their effects might be mediated via benzodiazepine receptors. CL 218,872 (10 mg/kg) was found to be significantly sedative in both mice and rats (i.e., both locomotor activity and head-dipping were significantly decreased). In mice, the effects of CL 218,872 and of chlordiazepoxide were very similar over a range of doses, except that the stimulatory effect seen with low doses of chlordiazepoxide on head-dipping just failed to reach significance with CL 218,872. This study is in agreement with recently published results from different tests showing that sedative effects can be obtained with doses of CL 218,872 that are low and not much higher than those leading to anxiolysis. The sedative effects of both CL 218,872 (10 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (20 mg/kg) were significantly reversed by RO 15-1788 (10 and 20 mg/kg) and CGS 8216 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that their effects are mediated via benzodiazepine receptors. The increase in head-dipping seen with chlordiazepoxide (2.5 mg/kg) was also reversed by RO 15-1788 and CGS 8216.", 
    "27": "Previous studies have shown that, in rodents, chlordiazepoxide and other benzodiazepines can interfere with learning in passive avoidance or conditioned suppression procedures. The most consistent effects are observed when the drugs are administered before the acquisition trial and subjects are re-tested in the non-drugged state. It is not clear, however, whether this effect on learning is associated with the behavioural depressant actions of these drugs. In the present study mice were injected with chloridiazepoxide, diazepam, zopiclone, or CGS 9896 and locomotor activity measured in a two-compartment box. The animals were then enclosed in one of the compartments and received a series of footshocks. On a second trial, 24 h after the first, the mice were returned to the box without injection and locomotion and time spent in each compartment were measured. During trial 1 chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and zopiclone produced dose-related decreases in locomotor activity. The same doses disrupted fear conditioning. CGS 9896 also interfered with the conditioning of fear but did not reduce exploratory activity during the first trial at any of a wide range of doses, showing that learning can be affected without direct behavioural depressant activity. In a further experiment, chlordiazepoxide and CGS 9896 disrupted fear conditioning when injected before trial 1 but not when injected immediately after this trial. Mice drugged with chlordiazepoxide or CGS 9896 before both trials 1 and 2 also showed disrupted conditioning, demonstrating that the drug effects cannot be interpreted in terms of state dependent learning.", 
    "28": "The continuing concern about tardive dyskinesia (TD) has stimulated a broad search for therapies for this disorder. Since neuroleptic drugs are thought to be the etiological agents, acting presumably through dopamine receptor blockade, nondopaminergic drugs have been the focus of recent study. However, no uniformly safe and effective drug treatment has been identified. Augmentation of cholinergic function is theoretically attractive, but further research is needed to develop practical and effective compounds. GABA drugs do not consistently suppress TD. The effect of benzodiazepines in TD is unclear, but these agents may be of some temporary benefit in patients with distressing symptoms. Lithium, serotonergic compounds, and numerous neuropeptides all fail to have any consistent effect in TD. Early reports of benefit with alpha- and beta-noradrenergic agents are interesting but require further study. Many other drug types have been tried without benefit. For the majority of patients, it may be best to give no drug treatment. Any drug that is capable of suppressing TD may aggravate the disorder in the long term. The potential for a spontaneous gradual remission of TD is an argument in favor of a patient, nonaggressive, and cautiously optimistic approach to this disorder.", 
    "29": "We review dystonia treatment results since 1981, including our own findings. Anticholinergics are still the most effective drugs, but less than 50% of patients continue with treatment. The authors recommend a combination of an anticholinergic, a benzodiazepine, and another drug (an antidopaminergic, carbamazepine, or fluperlapine) for the treatment of dystonia.", 
    "30": "Twelve healthy subjects ingested temazepam 20 mg in two different formulations (soft gelatine capsule or uncoated tablet) and matched placebo at one-week intervals in double-blind and cross-over conditions. Venous blood was sampled before the drug intake and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, and 24 hours after it, and plasma temazepam concentrations were assayed by gas chromatography. Psychomotor performance was measured objectively (digit symbol substitution, letter cancellation, Maddox wing) and subjectively (visual analogue scales) before the drug intake and 1, 2, and 3 hours after it. Peak concentrations of plasma temazepam were reached at about one hour, and they were higher after the capsule than after the tablet (mean values 750 vs. 587 ng/ml), while the computed AUCs and elimination half-lives (6-22 hours) proved to be similar after either formulation. Impaired performance was measured in objective tests over the first three hours, the capsule being somewhat more effective than the tablet. Self-assessments indicating subjective sedation returned to the placebo level within 3 hours after the capsule but not after the tablet. This rapid subjective recovery after the capsule might result from an acute tolerance developed after the high peak, and it tallies with the lack of residual sedation previously reported in trials with temazepam 20 mg given in soft gelatine capsules.", 
    "31": "We have studied benzodiazepines (BZD) intake among 129 patients admitted in an internal medicine unit. In this population, we have differentiated long term (over 4 months) users (n = 25), occasional users (n = 24), and non users (n = 80). Analysis of the results favoured the fact that BZD users were, more than non users, alike to have a history of cardiovascular and/or rheumatic diseases, to have had multiple surgical procedures and that these patients often took several other psychotropic and non psychotropic drugs. Particular characteristics of long term users are discussed next (prevalence, sex ratio, incidence of depression).", 
    "32": "The clinical efficacy of alprazolam has been evaluated in both anxiety states and depressive disorders. In anxiety neurosis, studies have been conducted vs placebo and/or other benzodiazepine tranquilizers. Reports, to date, with regard to panic/phobia disorders have been limited to open-label studies and a single report from a placebo-controlled study. In depression, both open-label and double-blind studies (vs tricyclic antidepressants) have been published.", 
    "33": "Chronically administered alprazolam and adinazolam attenuated the hyperactivity of bilaterally bulbectomized rats when placed in a stressful, novel environment ('open field' apparatus). These drugs had no effect on the activities of sham operated animals under the same experimental conditions. In other studies in these laboratories, clinically effective antidepressant drugs have been shown to have a qualitatively similar effect to alprazolam and adinazolam. Chronically administered diazepam and phenobarbitone did not affect the hyperactivity of bulbectomized rats in the 'open field' apparatus. No difference could be found between the behaviour of bulbectomized rats and the sham operated controls when the animals were placed in a novel, non-stressful environment ('hole board' apparatus and Y-maze). Chronic treatment of either the lesioned or non-lesioned animals with alprazolam or adinazolam did not cause any change in the behaviour of the animals in these situations. This suggests that the behaviour of the rat on the 'hole board' is not a reliable indication of anti-anxiety activity for chronically administered benzodiazepines. When unstarved lesioned and non-lesioned animals were given a choice of five palatable foods for a period of 1 h, slight differences in preference for the type of food chosen could be detected. Thus unsweetened biscuit ('cream crackers') was the most preferred choice of the sham operated rats while cheese and chocolate were the least preferred. Bulbectomized rats showed a more varied food choice, with processed meat ('corned beef') and raisins being preferred to biscuit in two out of four groups. Chronic treatment with either alprazolam or adinazolam did not appear to affect the food preference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "In a double-blind 28-day comparison of alprazolam, diazepam and placebo, alprazolam 1.5-3 mg/day was of equivalent anxiolytic effect to 15-30 mg diazepam/day and there was some evidence of antidepressant activity by alprazolam, but not diazepam, in neurotic depression. No serious side-effects or laboratory abnormalities were encountered.", 
    "35": "In clinical practice the benzodiazepines are prescribed almost as frequently as the tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of depression. The therapeutic effects of the benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants in depression have been compared in only 29 double-blind studies. The antidepressants proved overwhelmingly superior with only one study (alprazolam) even suggesting a possible parity of action. A symptom response analysis failed to show any true antidepressant action for the benzodiazepines. No clear indication for the use of a combination of drugs was revealed, although certain symptoms may show a more rapid response initially with combination therapy.", 
    "36": "The diagnosis of affective disorders is difficult, especially at mild to moderate levels of severity. Often symptomatic treatment is given in the absence of a clear diagnosis. Antidepressants are often efficacious in helping anxiety symptoms but antianxiety compounds are generally inefficacious in treating depression. Alprazolam is a possible exception and may have both antianxiety and antidepressant properties.", 
    "37": "Psychotropic drugs are often used to treat elderly patients suffering from disturbances of behavior, mood, memory, and sleep. Because of increased sensitivity of the aging brain to psychotropic drugs, altered pharmacokinetics, and increased likelihood of polypharmacy as people grow older, specific guidelines for the use of psychotropic drugs should be observed. These guidelines are discussed in the following article.", 
    "38": "The authors analyze the literature and their own data on the influence of neuroleptics on the cerebral dopamine and adrenoreceptors. It is shown that antipsychotic activity of neuroleptics correlates with their ability to block D2 dopamine receptor whereas their sedative properties are in a better agreement with the blockade of alpha 1-adrenoreceptor. Effects at the molecular level, other than the blockade of the above receptors, may be involved in forming the activity spectrum of each drug.", 
    "39": "Within four partial clinical trials of Astemizole versus placebo it has been proved, that no differences regarding the driving ability and the safe operation of machinery could be detected. Furthermore it could be observed, that there was no disadvantageous efficacy concerning subjective behaviour and that Astemizole did not potentiate Diazepam and alcohol.", 
    "40": "Approximately 50 million women use oral contraceptives (OC). Studies and case reports demonstrate that OC failure may be caused by rifampin, anticonvulsant drugs, and possibly some antibiotics. Contraceptive steroids may interfere with the metabolism of the benzodiazepines, theophylline, and the glucocorticoids. Future investigation will document the clinical significance of other OC interactions as well as give rise to new interactions.", 
    "41": "Neurotransmitters regulate palate shelf reorientation. Acetylcholine and serotonin stimulate, whereas GABA inhibits reorientation. Serotonin stimulates cell movement in an in vitro chemotactic system. Diazepam may cause cleft palate by mimicking GABA. Diazepam sensitivity may be caused by genotypic differences in a GABA-ergic system in the embryo.", 
    "42": "Intraperitoneally administered benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (2-5 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), flurazepam (1 mg/kg) and a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (0.5 mg/kg), reversed the antinociceptive effect in mice which was induced by intracisternal administration of 1 microgram of sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide. The antinociceptive effect of cholecystokinin was reversed by naloxone, suggesting that the antinociceptive action involves endogenous opioid peptides in its production. On the other hand, morphine-induced analgesia was not reversed by diazepam and Ro 15-1788. These facts rule out opioid receptors as the site of the antagonism between the benzodiazepines or Ro 15-1788 and cholecystokinin on the antinociceptive effect. Benzodiazepines and Ro 15-1788 seem to inhibit the release of opioid peptides induced by cholecystokinin.", 
    "43": "Dipotassium chlorazepate (DPC) and diazepam (DZM) were given i.m. and i.v. to 6 healthy volunteers in doses of 20 mg (48.9 mumol) DPC and 15 mg (52.0 mumol) DZM. The interval between the injections was at least 1 week. Plasma samples were analyzed for DPC and DZM by HPLC. The bioavailability of DPC and DZM after i.m. administration, determined from computer calculated AUCs, was 1.04 and 0.85, respectively.", 
    "44": "The effect of a benzodiazepine antagonist, ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazol[1,5a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788), on the cerebello-rubral rhythm induced by a water soluble benzodiazepine derivative (medazepam hydrochloride) or by a barbiturate (pentobarbital sodium) was investigated in the rabbit. The frequency of this rhythm which depends on the depth of the central depression caused by either of these agents was used for the drug interaction study. Ro 15-1788 when given alone up to 10 mg/kg did not cause any changes in the cerebello-rubral and the neocortical electrical activities. Ro 15-1788 (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) was effective in antagonizing the medazepam-induced cerebello-rubral rhythm and the rhythmic discharges of Purkinje cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antagonistic effect was also observed in the electrocorticogram. The pentobarbital-induced cerebello-rubral rhythm and the neocortical activity were not influenced by Ro 15-1788 up to 5 mg/kg. Thus, the similar effect of barbiturates and benzodiazepine derivatives on the cerebello-rubral system seems to be mediated by different pharmacodynamic actions. The findings are in line with previous studies indicating a selective antagonism of Ro 15-1788 and benzodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "45": "The anticonvulsant potential of 6-chloro-2-(ethylamino)-4-methyl-4-phenyl-4H-3,1-benzoxazine (etifoxine), a non-benzodiazepine tranquilizer, was evaluated in mice in comparison to valproate, phenytoin and clobazam. Maximal seizures were induced by electroshock (MES) and the chemical convulsants pentetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin (PTX), bicuculline (BIC), isoniazid (INH), nicotine (NIC) and strychnine (STR). Tonic extensor convulsions were prevented by etifoxine in the following rank order of potency (ED50 values with seizure tests): 39.5 (PTX), 101 (PTZ), 101 (MES), 154 (INH), 181 (NIC), 397 (BIC), and greater than 800 mg/kg p.o. (STR). Clonic seizures were induced by threshold doses of PTZ, PTX and pilocarpine (PIL) and antagonized by etifoxine at ED50 values of 181 (PIL), 221 (PTZ), and greater than 800 mg/kg p.o. (PTX). Hence, etifoxine blocked both tonic and clonic seizures but was more potent against the tonic component. The anticonvulsant profile of etifoxine appeared similar to that of valproate. However, in terms of potency, protective indices (ED50 rotarod/ED50 seizure test) and therapeutic indices (LD50/ED50 seizure test) etifoxine was on an average 3.7, 12 and 14 times superior to valproate, respectively. It is concluded that etifoxine has a marked anticonvulsive potential and may be beneficially used in epileptic disorders, especially of the grand mal type.", 
    "46": "Rats were exposed to combined enforced swimming and cold stress in order to investigate the influence of the sedative compounds 2-(2-oxo-3-piperidyl)-1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one-1,1-dioxide (supidimide), phenobarbital, and diazepam on stress-induced changes in cyclic adenosine 3',5'-phosphate (cAMP) and trans-synaptic induction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in adrenal glands. Pretreatment with supidimide at greater than or equal to 150 mg/kg suppresses the early poststress rise in cAMP and the delayed TH induction. Phenobarbital at 75 mg/kg slightly inhibits the cAMP increase, but does not significantly interfere with TH induction. Diazepam already at 5 mg/kg completely blocks the stress-induced increase of cAMP, but leaves the TH induction unchanged at dosages up to 20 mg/kg. It is concluded that the stress-induced rise in adrenal cAMP and the trans-synaptic induction of TH are rather coincidental than causally related. Suppression of TH induction by supidimide appears to be a peculiarity of this compound not strictly related to its sedative potency.", 
    "47": "The haemodynamic effects of induction of anaesthesia with diazepam (group D) and Althesin (group A) were studied in 25 coronary patients under betablockers with good myocardial function. Haemodynamic variables monitored were vascular pressures, cardiac output and systolic time intervals. The effects of both drugs were observed when used alone (time I) and in combination with fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide (time II). The results seemed to show that Althesin (12.51% fall in SI and 10.79% increase in PEP/LVET) depressed myocardial function more than diazepam (no significant difference), but the introduction of fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide removed the differences between the drugs as to their effect on myocardial performance. These drugs added a depressant effect to diazepam (13.83% fall in SI and 15.77% increase in PEP/LVET) without increasing Althesin's negative inotropic effect. However, in group A at time II, the pulmonary arterial pressure, the wedge pressure and the pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly reduced, while they remained stable in the diazepam group.", 
    "48": "The authors analyze the results of psychopharmacotherapy of 120 patients with slowly progressive schizophrenia characterized by a high resistance to the treatment. Two new methods of the intensive therapy of such conditions (discrete and daily intravenous drip of tranquilizers in conjunction with low doses of neuroleptics) are described. The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic substantiation of each of the two techniques is presented. Clinical indications for their use have been elaborated.", 
    "49": "It is hypothesized that neuropharmacologic agents are more teratogenic to humans. Since many neuropharmacologic agents function through neurotransmitter mechanisms, then neurotransmitters should function to regulate embryonic development. Evidence has been obtained that neurotransmitters do indeed function as biological signals in palate development. It has been shown that palate reorientation is modulated by neurotransmitters with a wide range of diversity, similar to the CNS. Thus serotonin and acetylcholine stimulate and GABA inhibits the reorientation process. Spatial diversity is also observed: serotonin functions at the anterior and acetylcholine at the posterior end, and GABA functions more efficiently at either end in different inbred strains. Many criteria for functioning neurotransmitters have been obtained. Both serotonin and GABA have been measured in the palate and developmental changes observed. Physiologic responses to serotonin have been monitored. Serotonin has been shown to stimulate palate cell motility as well as protein carboxyl methylation and cyclic GMP. The serotonin effects on protein carboxyl methylation and cyclic GMP could function to stimulate palate reorientation by modulating cell contractility and protein secretion. Further support for the hypothesis that neuropharmacologic agents could be teratogenic by perturbation of neurotransmitter mechanisms comes from studying GABA and diazepam. Evidence has been obtained that diazepam induces cleft palate by mimicking GABA in a functional GABAergic system in palate development. A significant finding is that genetic differences in both diazepam teratogenesis and in a GABAergic system have been observed. Comparing the SWV and AJ strains, the SWV mouse showed (1) a greater sensitivity to diazepam-induced cleft palate, (2) a greater sensitivity to GABA and diazepam inhibition of palate reorientation in embryo culture, (3) a greater concentration of palatal GABA and (4) a more efficient GABA uptake system. These results are suggestive that diazepam may be more teratogenic in individuals of both the mouse and human who possess a more developed GABAergic mechanism. If such a result would obtain in the human, these genotypic differences in GABA would probably not influence the individual to a significant degree in most situations, except for the pregnant woman being at high risk when treated with diazepam.", 
    "50": "It has been established that phenazepam is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and man. The maximal concentrations of the unchanged drugs are reached 1, 0.5, 2 and 4 hours in rats, dogs, cats and man, respectively. The half-life of phenazepam in animal and human blood decreases in the following order: man greater than cat greater than dog greater than rat. The metabolite 3 + hydroxyphenazepam was identified in appreciable amounts in cat and rat blood.", 
    "51": "Stereoselective glucuronidation of the chiral drug oxazepam by hepatic microsomes from rabbits pretreated with various inducers was used to characterize induced UDP-glucuronyltransferase (GT) enzymes. The enzymes were induced by pretreatment of rabbits with phenobarbital, DDT, 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone, ethanol, trans-stilbene oxide, pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, Aroclor 1254, and clofibric acid. Hepatic microsomes from induced and control animals were incubated with racemic oxazepam and the activator, Lubrol PX. Relative amounts of the diastereomeric beta-glucuronides were determined by HPLC. Significant differences were found in enantiomeric selectivity among the microsomes from rabbits pretreated with different inducers. The largest difference in diastereomeric glucuronide ratios observed was between control (R/S = 0.76) and beta-naphthoflavone-induced microsomes (R/S = 1.41). This demonstrated a significant change in enantiomeric selectivity by the enzymes, changing from preference for the S enantiomer in controls to its R antipode after induction. Differences in stereoselectivity between two members of a class of inducers such as 3-methylcholanthrene (R/S = 1.16) and beta-naphthoflavone (R/S = 1.41), provided evidence for possible distinctions between these similar inducers. Inducers of GT1 UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzyme forms, such as 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone, and Aroclor 1254, did not increase the rate of formation of oxazepam glucuronides. All other inducers except DDT increased the rate of oxazepam glucuronidation by 20-53% with the highest rate (0.23 nmol/min X mg protein) occurring after trans-stilbene oxide induction. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was also used as an activator to provide a comparison of the Lubrol-activated microsomes with the endogenous activator. Relative differences among inducers were approximately the same with both activators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The absorption, metabolism, and excretion of quazepam, a new benzodiazepine hypnotic, was investigated in six normal male volunteers after oral administration of 25 mg 14C-quazepam in solution. Quazepam was well absorbed. Plasma radioactivity peaked (324.6 ng quazepam eq/ml) 1.75 hr postdose. Unchanged quazepam reached its maximum plasma level (148 ng/ml) at 1.5 hr with an apparent absorption half-life of 0.4 hr. Major plasma metabolites of quazepam were 2-oxoquazepam (OQ), obtained by replacement of S by O,N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (DOQ), and 3-hydroxy-2-oxoquazepam (HOQ) glucuronide. Both OQ and DOQ are pharmacologically active. Plasma elimination half-lives for quazepam, OQ, DOQ, and radioactivity were 39, 40, 69, and 76 hr, respectively. The respective AUC (120 hr) values were 715, 438, 3323, and 11402 hr X ng/ml. Approximately 54% of the radioactive dose was excreted in the urine (31.3%) and feces (22.7%) over a 5-day period. HOQ glucuronide was the major urinary metabolite of quazepam. Other metabolites present in the urine in relatively large amounts were glucuronides of DOQ and HDOQ.", 
    "53": "Time courses of anticonvulsive effect nd benzodiazepine receptor occupation in the brain were determined after iv administration of diazepam (DZP) (1.2 mg/kg) to rats. Score for the anticonvulsive effect was assigned to each DZP-treated rat depending on the degree of protection against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. Measurement of in vivo receptor occupation was made by comparing the specific 3H-DZP binding in vitro to the crude synaptosomal fractions between vehicle-treated rats (control) and DZP-injected rats. The receptor occupation declined in parallel with the anticonvulsive effect with approximate half-life of 1 hr. A good linear correlation (r = 0.977) was observed between the receptor occupation and the anticonvulsive effect. The time course of anticonvulsive effect was further compared with that of DZP concentration in the brain which was previously reported [Igari et al., Drug Metab. Dispos. 10, 676 (1982)]. The anticonvulsive effect was nonlinearly related to the DZP concentration in the brain with the half-maximum concentration, Kd in vivo of 793 nM. The half-maximum concentration for the unbound DZP, Kd in vivo was also estimated to be 113 nM, which was still 50 times the values of Kd (2.3 nM) determined at 0 degree C from an in vitro binding study of 3H-DZP to the receptor in the crude synaptosomal fraction.", 
    "54": "A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric procedure was employed to identify flurazepam and several of its metabolites in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain of cats after an iv injection of flurazepam. Following tissue redistribution, flurazepam was lost from plasma with a mean half-time of 1.4 hr; although usually not detectable in plasma by 24 hr, significant quantities were found in the brain at this time, particularly in the corpus callosum. N1-Hydroxyethyl flurazepam appeared rapidly in plasma following iv flurazepam, peaked at about 40 min, and then declined with a mean half-time of 2.1 hr. N1-Desalkyl flurazepam accumulated in plasma in the first 6 hr after flurazepam was injected, and then declined slowly with a mean half-time of about 50 hr. At 24 hr, corpus callosum concentrations of the N1-desalkyl flurazepam exceeded those of flurazepam by 16- to 63-fold and produced brain/plasma ratios of 6 to 62 in three cats. CSF concentrations of flurazepam and N1-desalkyl flurazepam did not reflect brain concentrations but only the estimated plasma fractions of the unbound drugs. The results suggest that long term central effects of iv flurazepam are mediated to a large extent by the N1-desalkyl flurazepam, in species in which that metabolite accumulates.", 
    "55": "The use of analgesic and sedative medications in plastic surgery can be divided into two main categories: premedication for general and local anesthesia and intraoperative sedation as an adjunct to local anesthesia. The actions and applications of specific agents are discussed.", 
    "56": "Healthy volunteers received single doses of three benzodiazepines (diazepam, 10 mg i.v.; alprazolam, 1.0 mg orally; lorazepam, 2 mg i.v.) on two occasions in random sequence. One trial was a control; for the other, subjects ingested propoxyphene, 65 mg every 6 h, for the duration of the benzodiazepine study. The kinetics of each benzodiazepine were determined from multiple plasma concentrations measured following each dose. For diazepam, propoxyphene produced a small and statistically insignificant prolongation of elimination half-life (43 vs 38 h) and reduction of total clearance (0.41 vs 0.47 ml min-1 kg-1). Propoxyphene significantly prolonged alprazolam half-life (18 vs 12 h, P less than 0.005) and reduced total clearance (0.8 vs 1.3 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.005). Propoxyphene had no apparent influence on lorazepam half-life (13.4 vs 13.5 h) or clearance (1.5 vs 1.4 ml min-1 kg-1). Thus propoxyphene significantly impairs the clearance of alprazolam, biotransformed mainly by the oxidative reaction of aliphatic hydroxylation. Propoxyphene has far less effect on the oxidation of diazepam by N-demethylation, and has no apparent influence on lorazepam conjugation.", 
    "57": "A variety of anxiogenic substances, benzodiazepine antagonists and antidepressants were tested in a shuttlebox task in which rats interrupted infrared beams to initiate (ON latency) and terminate (OFF latency) continuous rewarding brain stimulation. It was hypothesized that substances exhibiting anxiogenic activity in animals (pentylenetetrazol and beta-CCM) would selectively reduce the OFF latency, since anxiolytic drugs increase this latency. beta-CCM, however, did not alter the OFF latency, but instead lengthened the ON latency. Pentylenetetrazol showed a similar, though not significant, trend. Ro 15-1788 did not alter ON latencies, but selectively lengthened the OFF latency at a high dose, consistent with previously reported anxiolytic activity at such doses. In contrast, CGS 8216 lengthened the ON latency selectively. Thus, Ro 15-1788 was differentiated from other drugs that antagonize benzodiazepines. Caffeine and dopamine uptake-blocking antidepressants (amineptine and nomifensine) preferentially decreased ON latencies, while non-dopamine-blocking antidepressants (viloxazine and CGS 7525A) lengthened both latencies nonspecifically. In conclusion, the OFF latency (but not the ON latency) appears refractory to reduction by various classes of psychotropic agents.", 
    "58": "The hypothesis that analgesic mechanisms might account for the suppressive effect of diazepam on defensive burying was tested in four experiments. In the first experiment, 1 mg/kg of diazepam had no appreciable effect on rat's latency to escape from a painful heat stimulus, but reliably suppressed defensive burying behavior. There was no significant relationship between the diazepam-treated rats' latency to escape and their duration of burying. Rats in Experiment 2 were injected with diazepam during a delay between shock and testing, so that they could not be experiencing the putative analgesic effect of diazepam during the shock. In spite of this, diazepam produced a significant suppression of burying compared to saline control. In the next experiment, the effect of diazepam on defensive burying was assessed in the complete absence of painful stimulation by exposing the rats to a novel stimulus known to elicit burying behavior. Diazepam suppressed burying behavior to the novel stimulus in a dose-dependent fashion. Finally, the ability of 10 mg/kg of naloxone to reverse the suppressive effect of 1 mg/kg of diazepam was assessed in Experiment 4. Naloxone failed to reverse the suppressive effect of diazepam and had no significant effect on defensive burying by itself, suggesting that the modulating influence of diazepam on rats' defensive burying behavior did not depend upon endogenous opiate mechanisms. Taken together, the results of the four experiments did not support the view that benzodiazepines produce their anxiolytic effects through analgesic mechanisms.", 
    "59": "In animals, as in humans, benzodiazepines affect memory, inducing almost exclusively an anterograde amnesia. The characteristics of this amnesic-like effect are reviewed in terms of alterations in acquisition, consolidation, recall and/or forgetting processes. Explanations alternative to a true amnesia, i.e., state-dependent learning, cognitive deficits, attenuation of the emotional weight of the conditioning events are examined. Finally, the interference of these putative amnesic effects with experimental procedures devoted to the study of the anxiolytic activities of benzodiazepines are considered.", 
    "60": "A qualitative description of the amnesia produced by the benzodiazepines in man is presented. The benzodiazepines exert their greatest effects in tests of long-term episodic memory in which they cause a dose-related impairment in the acquisition of new information, do not appear to affect retention and may facilitate retrieval. Benzodiazepines do not appear to impair semantic memory or the acquisition of skills. Although state-dependent learning may be observed with benzodiazepine treatment it is a small effect and cannot account for most of the observed impairments. The amnesia appears to be characteristic of all benzodiazepines and may be related to the sedative action of these compounds but evidence on the latter point is inconclusive. The importance of the amnesic action in a population of clinically anxious outpatients taking benzodiazepines over an extended period remains to be investigated. The benzodiazepines may provide the cognitive psychologist with a useful tool to investigate the mechanisms of normal memory.", 
    "61": "The premise of this review is that neuronal substrates of anxiety are amenable to investigation using brain stimulation techniques. Anxiolytics such as meprobamate and the benzodiazepines may enhance intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) behavior. Although demonstrated by numerous investigators, this effect shows considerable variability between and within laboratories. Some of this variability is explained by sedative/muscle relaxant effects, which are dissociable from drug-induced increases in ICSS and which may mask these increases. The anticonvulsant actions of anxiolytic drugs are unlikely to account for the increases in ICSS. Rather, anxiolytics appear to increase ICSS by attenuating concurrent aversive properties of stimulation. Consistent with this explanation, anxiolytic drugs attenuate escape from aversive dorsal tegmental stimulation. The neuronal substrates of this centrally mediated escape behavior differ from those mediating footshock-induced escape. Barbiturates also enhance ICSS, possibly due in part to an excitatory component that is not involved in benzodiazepine action. Inverse benzodiazepine agonists attenuate ICSS behavior in a manner that cannot be explained by nonspecific performance impairment. These substances, however, may not necessarily enhance stimulation-induced aversiveness. A strategy is proposed to integrate brain stimulation studies with molecular approaches to anxiety. Specifically, stimulation of sites associated with fear induction or fear reduction may selectively alter the release of endogeneous anxiogens or anxiolytic substances.", 
    "62": "The effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, a series of novel putative anxiolytic compounds and anxiogenic compounds are reviewed in animal tests of anxiety and on experimentally-induced seizures. It is clear from the data that drug effects on anxiety and convulsions are not always in the same direction; certain compounds are apparently both anxiolytic and proconvulsant, others are anxiogenic and anticonvulsant, others have varied effects depending on the test situation. It is suggested that this work necessitates considerable revision of our traditional concepts of an \"anticonvulsant.\" The extent to which drug-induced anxiety is correlated with weak epileptiform activity in the brain is discussed. Finally, the Discussion considers a number of possible mechanisms that could underlie the separation of drug effects on anxiety and convulsions that is observed.", 
    "63": "The purpose of this review is to assess the value of using tests of exploratory behavior to study the actions of benzodiazepines. The methods of measuring exploration and the factors influencing it are briefly described. The effects of benzodiazepines on exploratory behavior of rats and mice are reviewed; and the dangers of interpreting the results of such tests in terms of any of the clinical effects of the benzodiazepines is stressed. Finally, the interactions between benzodiazepines and other drugs acting at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex are described. The results of these experiments caution against global classification of compounds as benzodiazepine \"antagonists.\"", 
    "64": "Parameters of exploratory behaviors responsive to anti-anxiety drugs are reviewed with respect to their sensitivity and specificity for anxiolytics in mice. Mouse models appear to rest on a disinhibition of natural exploratory tendencies by anxiolytic treatments. Analysis of agonists of the brain benzodiazepine binding site, such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, significantly increase exploration of a hole-board, of a two-chambered light in equilibrium dark apparatus, increase social interaction under high levels of illumination, increase consumption of a novel food in an unfamiliar environment, and increase punished crossings in a footshock conflict paradigm. These tests detect anxiolytic responses at doses of benzodiazepines well within the clinically effective range. Pharmacological specificity was established for the hole-board and light in equilibrium transition tests, showing that non-anxiolytic categories of psychoactive drugs did not produce false positives. Open field behaviors and isolation-induced aggression were reduced by anxiolytics, at doses which may be within the sedative-hypnotic range. Analysis of antagonists of the brain benzodiazepine binding site did not show active antagonist properties in the light in equilibrium transitions model, although the antagonist Ro-15-1788 appeared to have partial agonist properties in the open field test, suggesting that rat models may be more sensitive to anxiogenic compounds than are mouse models. The wide separation between anxiolytic and sedative doses in mouse models recommend these exploration paradigms as good predictive screens for the testing of novel anxiolytic compounds.", 
    "65": "A review of the literature on chlordiazepoxide indicates that the traditional view of benzodiazepines as antiaggressive drugs represents an inaccurate generalization. In fact, highly variable findings have been reported with the most significant factor in the variability being the type of aggression studied. Furthermore, considerable controversy surrounds the nature of chlordiazepoxide's influence on social conflict in rodents, with opinion divided regarding the selectivity of its inhibitory effect on offensive responding. It is argued that inappropriate behavioural methodology may have substantially contributed to this controversy. A pharmacoethological approach to the analysis of drug effects on social behaviour is described and exemplified by new data on chlordiazepoxide and midazolam. Both agents inhibit offense at doses which do not result in general response inhibition, yet their overall behavioural profiles are somewhat different. Evidence is also presented indicating low dose behavioural activity of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 in two test situations and suggesting possible differences in the effects of Ro15-1788 and CGS8216 on novelty-related responding. Several avenues of research are discussed which may yield insights into the manner whereby benzodiazepines influence social patterns and the significance of benzodiazepine-GABA interactions in such processes.", 
    "66": "The abuse liability of a drug is a positive, interactive function of the reinforcing and adverse effects of the drug. The relative abuse liability of the hypnotic benzodiazepine, triazolam, has been controversial. This paper reviews animal and human studies bearing on its relative abuse liability, including data on pharmacological profile, reinforcing effects, liking, speed of onset, discriminative stimulus effects, subjective effects, physiological dependence, rebound and early morning insomnia, drug produced anxiety, lethality in overdose, psychomotor impairment, interactions with ethanol, anterograde amnesia, impaired awareness of drug effect, and other psychiatric and behavioral disturbances. It is concluded that the abuse liability of triazolam is less than that of the intermediate duration barbiturates such as pentobarbital. Although there are considerable data indicating similarities of triazolam to other benzodiazepines, there is also substantial speculation among clinical investigators and some limited data suggesting that the abuse liability of triazolam is greater than that of a variety of other benzodiazepines, and virtually no credible data or speculation that it is less. Further research will be necessary to clarify definitively the abuse liability of triazolam relative to other benzodiazepines.",

Experiments are described in which a radioreceptor assay is used to follow benzodiazepine activity in CSF samples during daily flurazepam treatment of cats. Tolerance is evident even after the second dose, despite increasing CSF drug activity, showing a large and rapidly developing functional tolerance. Other studies are discussed which also show tolerance within 24 hours of initiating benzodiazepine treatment. In contrast, a spontaneous withdrawal syndrome is usually seen only after prolonged treatment with high doses. However, physical dependence can also be studied by precipitating abstinence with a benzodiazepine antagonist, such as Ro15-1788. Cats were treated daily with flurazepam, then Ro15-1788 was given and abstinence signs were recorded. Abstinence could be precipitated 24 hours after beginning treatment, and dependence was nearly maximal after 7 days. Dependence developed during treatment with as little as 0.5 mg/kg flurazepam, which is near threshold for any behavioral response. Chronic diazepam caused the same dependence as flurazepam. Thus, the development of tolerance and physical dependence both show a remarkably rapid adaptation of the CNS in response to benzodiazepines.", 
    "68": "The evidence for tolerance to the behavioral effects in animals of benzodiazepines is reviewed. Tolerance develops rapidly (within 3-5 days) to the sedative effects and from 5 days of treatment to the anticonvulsant effects. In general, tolerance has not been found to anxiolytic effects after 7-15 days of treatment, although in the social interaction test it was found after 25 days. Tolerance has not been found to the locomotor stimulant effects up to 20 days of treatment. Dispositional tolerance does not occur following treatment with low doses and nor is there clear evidence of changes in benzodiazepine binding. Such changes could not account for the very different rates of tolerance to the different behavioral effects, but these could be explained if learned adaptation were to underlie tolerance or to influence the rate at which it develops. Whether the mechanism of learned adaptation is one of instrumental conditioning, classical conditioning or habituation will depend on the formal aspects of the test. It is therefore suggested that the different rates of tolerance are a function of the detailed arrangement of the experimental situation and not of the particular behavior measured or of the clinical effect the test is meant to reflect.", 
    "69": "This paper reviews: the development of benzodiazepine binding-sites and the GABA system; the evidence that prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines can cause malformations; other persisting effects of developmental exposure to benzodiazepines; and the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines (and other relevant drugs) in immature animals. The review concentrates on the rat, since fundamental work in other species is scarce. The data on neurochemical development are found to be generally consistent; however, reports that the enhancement of benzodiazepine binding by GABA varies with age are controversial. The physical development of the rat is disturbed only by extremely high doses of benzodiazepines. The evidence for persisting effects after early exposure to benzodiazepines is impressive at first sight, but in most studies, confounding variables have not been eliminated. Startle and some learning tasks are affected by prenatal diazepam; submissiveness is affected by neonatal lorazepam; social behaviour and convulsions are affected by neonatal CGS 8216. Benzodiazepines inhibit chemically-induced seizures in neonatal rats, but the developmental profile of sensitivity to the convulsants is disputed. Benzodiazepines stimulate motor behavior in the neonatal rat.", 
    "70": "This article sets the background for the following series of articles on the behavioral actions of drugs acting at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The articles provide detailed analyses of particular behaviors and emphasise the danger of interpreting all behavioral effects in terms of anxiety. What also emerges clearly from several of the articles is that any agonist/inverse agonist classification is test-dependent and that global categorisation is not possible for many of the novel compounds.", 
    "71": "Terfenadine is a selective H1-histamine receptor antagonist. The lack of significant terfenadine penetration into the CNS is probably responsible for its lack of CNS effects. Terfenadine neither impairs psychomotor performance nor adversely affects subjective feelings, nor enhances the depressant effects of concomitantly administered alcohol or benzodiazepines. In controlled studies, the incidence of sedation due to terfenadine was comparable with that of placebo and significantly less than that with conventional antihistamines. Clinical studies have shown terfenadine to be comparable in efficacy with other antihistamines while being superior to placebo in alleviating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Additionally, there is good evidence that it is similarly as effective when used in the treatment of perennial rhinitis and histamine-mediated skin diseases. Thus, terfenadine offers a worthwhile improvement in side effect profile over 'traditional' antihistamines, and could well become an 'agent of choice' (along with other non-sedating antihistamines) in many patients in whom a histamine H1-receptor antagonist is indicated.", 
    "72": "It has been shown in rats with experimental toxic and traumatic edemas that picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) removes the antiedematous action of diazepam, phenazepam, phenibut and amizyl and reduces the action of phentolamine. When the dose of picrotoxin is minimized to 0.5 mg/kg such an effect is not observed. Prolonged daily administration of picrotoxin in a dose of 1 mg/kg results in the development of brain edema. It is recommended that GABA-positive drugs be included into a complex of treatment measures for edema.", 
    "73": "The authors report a significant increase in dyscontrol in patients with borderline personality disorder who were taking alprazolam during a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. They suggest that caution be used in prescribing alprazolam to patients with similar histories.", 
    "74": "A patient who received therapeutic doses of alprazolam for 8 weeks experienced a withdrawal syndrome beginning 18 hours after its abrupt discontinuation. Short-acting and minimally sedating benzodiazepines may have increased potential for withdrawal reactions.", 
    "75": "Clonidine hydrochloride masked the signs of sedative withdrawal when it was used in detoxification of a patient with sedative-opiate-amphetamine dependence. Therefore, we urge caution in the use of clonidine in mixed-drug detoxification regimens.", 
    "76": "By selectively blocking cross-interferences from other types of binding sites, a binding site which likely represents kappa opioid binding sites was obtained in the guinea-pig brain suspension of the particulate fraction. Selective ligands for mu, sigma, delta and epsilon opioid binding sites were poor inhibitors for inhibiting [3H]ethylketocyclazocine binding to this site, whereas kappa opioids like oxilorphan, dynorphin(1-13), ethylketocyclazocine, butorphanol, cyclazocine, ketocyclazocine, tifluadom, nalorphine, pentazocine, U-50-488, nalbuphine and naloxone were potent ligands. Buprenorphine, generally believed to be a mu opiate, was the most potent inhibitor at the kappa site. Scatchard analysis of the saturation curve of [3H]ethylketocyclazocine binding revealed two subtypes of kappa binding sites: a high-affinity site and a low-affinity site with Kd = 0.7 and 78 nM and maximum binding = 22 and 101 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. Analysis of the inhibition curves suggested that tifluadom may be a selective ligand for the high-affinity site and that dynorphin(1-13) and U-50-488 may bind preferentially the high-affinity site but still possess appreciable affinity for the low-affinity site. This study demonstrates a selective assay for kappa opioid binding sites and indicates a possibility of the heterogeneity of kappa opioid binding sites in the brain.", 
    "77": "Acute administration of clonazepam (0.5-8.0 mg/kg, i.p.), diazepam (2-32 mg/kg, i.p.), chlordiazepoxide (1-40 mg/kg, i.p.) or diphenylhydantoin (5-320 mg/kg, i.p.), caused a dose-related elevation of the concentrations of, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and tryptophan in whole mouse brain. Carbamazepine (5-100 mg/kg, i.p.), and phenobarbitone (10-80 mg/kg, i.p.) raised the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the brain, whereas flurazepam (5-80 mg/kg, i.p.) only elevated the level of 5-HIAA. After administration of L[G-3H]tryptophan (25 microCi, s.c.), clonazepam (4 mg/kg), diazepam (32 mg/kg, i.p.), chlordiazepoxide (40 mg/kg) or diphenylhydantoin (40 mg/kg), but not carbamazepine (50 mg/kg), flurazepam (40 mg/kg) or phenobarbitone (80 mg/kg), increased the content of labelled tryptophan in brain. However, administration of drugs did not alter the incorporation of the label into [3H]5-HT, suggesting that the synthesis of 5-HT was unaffected. When incorporation of [3H]tryptophan into [3H]5-HT was complete and the pool of labelled 5-HT was decreasing, clonazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and diphenylhydantoin elevated the content of [3H]5-HT in brain. Flurazepam, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were without apparent effect. Calculation of the rate of utilization of 5-HT (Km) showed that all drugs, apart from flurazepam, reduced the utilization of 5-HT. Using the rate of disappearance of 5-HT after inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), all drugs, except flurazepam, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbitone, decreased the utilization of 5-HT. The major action of the anticonvulsant drugs on the function of 5-HT in brain appears to be a decrease in the utilization of 5-HT without altering synthesis.", 
    "78": "Drugs which are agonists at benzodiazepine receptors produce many interesting behavioural effects, and amongst these are the stimulation of food, water and salt intake. This review examines the evidence for benzodiazepine effects on these forms of ingestion, and makes tentative proposals about their modes of action. The recent advent of putative benzodiazepine antagonists and inverse agonists provides important new pharmacological tools for the analysis of factors which control ingestion. Preliminary data on examples of such drugs are considered. Anorectic effects of inverse agonists are described. It is clear, though, that the categorization of a drug in one test situation may not apply to another. For example, the compound Ro15-1788 appears as a specific antagonist in one test, a partial agonist in another, and apparently lacks effect in a third. We are not yet sufficiently forward in our understanding of drug actions at benzodiazepine receptors, and their interactions with particular test circumstances, to predict and account for divergent effects of this kind."
