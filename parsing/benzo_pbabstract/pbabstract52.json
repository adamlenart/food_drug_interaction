    "0": "Psychosocial care and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) are the preferred strategies for the management of heroin addicts, but the results are still unsatisfactory, justifying the search and intervention of the factors influencing the response to treatment.", 
    "1": "In order to determine the contribution of demographic, clinical and genetic variables on serum concentrations and response to methadone, we investigated patients on MMT, who were receiving methadone in supervised and unchanged doses at least during the previous two weeks. The age, gender, body mass index (BMI), duration of heroin abuse, addiction to other drugs, criminal background, current daily methadone doses, time spent in the TMM, comorbidity and concomitant medication were recorded. Blood samples were taken for the determination of serum levels of racemic methadone and its R and S-enantiomers, and for typing of candidate alleles of POR, CYP2B6, ABCB1, GRIN1, OPRM1, SLC6A3, D\u00dfH and ARRB2 genes, all associated with the metabolism, tissue distribution and mechanism of action of methadone. Methadone quantification was by HPLC-DAD, and the detection of genetic markers by Real Time PCR and VNTR methods.", 
    "2": "A total of 80 subject volunteers were enrolled, with a mean age of 23.5 (5) years (86% male), all of them were addicts of multiple drugs, 60% with a criminal background, 5.1 (2.9) years taking heroin, and 5.3 (4) months on MMT, and taking a supervised dose of 41 (12) mg/day methadone. The (R), (S) and (R, S) methadone enantiomer trough plasma levels were, 84 (40), 84 (42), and 168 (77) ng/mL, respectively. All genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The two urine tests were negative for heroin in 61.3% (49/80) of the volunteers, the decline in cocaine/crack use was 83%, 30% of marijuana, and other psychoactives (inhalants, benzodiazepines, amphetamines) decreased to zero, while the consumption of snuff remained at 93.5% (75/80). Blood concentrations of racemic methadone and its enantiomers were significantly associated with the dose/day of the medication, but none of the other demographic, clinical or genetic variables impacted on serum levels of methadone. As for the results of the MMT, non-users and occasional users of heroin, as well as those who stopped taking other psychoactive drugs, and the ones who did not, were similar as regards the demographic, genetic and clinical variables. This included the blood metahdone concentrations, except for individuals who did not reduce their consumption of other psychoactives other than heroin, who had significantly (P=.03) higher blood levels of S-methadone, compared with those who did stop taking them.", 
    "3": "There was a significant reduction in the consumption of heroin and other psychoactives, and social rehabilitation of patients. However, the extensive overlap between effective and ineffective doses of methadone suggests the presence of personal and social variables that transcend the simple pharmacological management. These probably need to be addressed more successfully from the psychosocial features, particularly as regards to identifying and overcoming relapse-trigger experiences, as well as certain features of the patient, such as their psychological distress level or their psychiatric disorders.", 
    "4": "Pregnant women and their health care professionals commonly believe that use of medications during pregnancy may be harmful to the unborn fetus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk perception of psychotropic drug use in pregnancy among physicians in different medical specialties.", 
    "5": "This was a convenience survey conducted at outpatient clinics in the cities of Recife, Brazil, and La Plata, Bah\u00eda Blanca, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Physicians who agreed to participate were asked to rate their perception of teratogenic risk among different classes of drugs, which included antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines.", 
    "6": "Two hundred and thirty-eight physicians completed the survey (response rate, 98%). These included psychiatrists, obstetricians, neurologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, and general practitioners. Among different specialties, a minority of psychiatrists perceived psychotropic drugs to be highly teratogenic (antidepressants, 12.5%; antipsychotics, 15%; benzodiazepines, 25%) as compared with other specialties (p < 0.003 for each drug class). There was no difference in perceived risk of antiepileptic drugs among specialties, including psychiatrists.", 
    "7": "The risk associated with use of psychotropic drugs in pregnancy was overestimated by physicians of all medical specialties, except psychiatry. All physicians should be aware of the safety/risk of psychotropic agents in pregnancy, as they may be required to give advice and/or prescribe these drugs to pregnant women.", 
    "8": "Few controlled trials exist to demonstrate the efficacy and the risks of pharmacologic agents used in treating pediatric, and more specifically neonatal patients. It is not different for the central nervous system altering class of drugs, benzodiazepines (BZDs). Little information is known about the long-term effects of BZDs use in neonates as anxiolytics and sedatives causing trepidation with their use in the clinical setting. Insufficient data related to the use of BZDs result in a lack of clear recommendations to guide caregivers at the bedside on the safest administration patterns to avoid long-term adverse effects. However, caring for ill neonates, in particular surgical patients and infants requiring prolonged hospitalizations, necessitates the use of these agents. A literature search within the electronic database, PubMed, of English language, full-text articles published between 2007 and 2012 was undertaken to determine the state of the science regarding the use of BZDs in neonates. These medications cause unwanted effects in neonates with immature hepatic function (primary site of metabolism) and during a developmental period of tremendous neuroplasticity. It benefits caregivers to recognize the need for improved monitoring of stress experienced by infants in the NICU and understand the impact of prolonged agitation and subacute pain on infant development.", 
    "9": "The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) for the dying patient is a UK care pathway covering palliative care options for patients in the final days or hours of life; it has recently been recommended for decommission in the UK following an independent review. The pathway was widely implemented in UK hospitals in part because of governmental financial incentives. One of the criticisms of the LCP included reports of the rapid escalation to continuous infusions of sedatives in patients who then became quickly unconscious and unable to communicate.", 
    "10": "Five simple and sensitive methods were developed for the determination of tofisopam (TF). The first four are stability-indicating depending on the determination of TF in the presence of its degradation product, while the fifth depended on the determination of TF via its degradation product. Method A was based on first and second derivative spectrophotometry, D and 2D, measuring the amplitude at 298 and 332 nm in the case of 1D and at 312 and 344 nm in the case of 2D. Method B depended on measuring the peak amplitude of the first derivative of the ratio spectra 1DD at 336 nm. Method C was based on difference spectrophotometry by measuring deltaA at 366 nm. Method D was a TLC method using silica gel 60 F254 plates, the optimized mobile phase ethyl acetate-methanol-ammonium hydroxide 10% (8.5 + 1.0 + 0.5, v/v/v), and quantification by densitometric scanning at 315 nm. In method E, spectrofluorometry was applied for the determination of TF via its degradation product; maximum emission was 383 nm when excitation was 295 nm. Linearities were obtained in the concentration range 2-20 microg/mL for methods A, B, and C and 2-20 microg/band and 0.2-1.6 microg/mL for D and E, respectively. In method A, the mean recoveries were 99.45 +/- 0.287 and 100.28 +/- 0.277% at 298 and 332 nm, respectively, in the case of 1D and 99.40 +/- 0.245% and 99.50 +/- 0.292% at 312 and 344 nm, respectively in the case of 2D. The mean recovery was 100.03 +/- 0.523% at 366 nm in method B. Method C showed mean recovery of 100.20 +/- 0.642%. Recoveries for methods D and E were 98.98 +/- 0.721 and 100.25 +/- 0.282%, respectively. The degradation product was obtained in acidic stress condition, separated, and identified by IR and mass spectral analysis, from which the degradation product was confirmed and the degradation pathway was suggested. The first four methods were specific for TF in the presence of different concentrations of its degradation product. The five proposed methods were successfully applied for the determination of TF in Nodeprine tablets. Statistical comparison among the results obtained by these methods and that obtained by the official method for the determination of the drug was made, and no significant differences were found.", 
    "11": "Current cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and 3A4 ontogeny profiles, which are derived mainly from in vitro studies and incorporated in paediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, have been reported to under-predict the in vivo clearances of some model substrates in neonates and infants.", 
    "12": "We report ontogeny functions for these enzymes as paediatric to adult relative intrinsic clearance per mg of hepatic microsomal protein, based on the deconvolution of in vivo pharmacokinetic data and by accounting for the impact of known clinical condition on hepatic unbound intrinsic clearance for caffeine and theophylline as markers of CYP1A2 activity and for midazolam as a marker of CYP3A4 activity.", 
    "13": "The function for CYP1A2 describes an increase in relative intrinsic metabolic clearance from birth to 3\u00a0years followed by a decrease to adult values. The function for CYP3A4 describes a continuous rise in relative intrinsic metabolic clearance, reaching the adult value at about 1.3\u00a0years of age. The new models were validated by showing improved predictions of the systemic clearances of ropivacaine (major CYP1A2 substrate; minor CYP3A4 substrate) and alfentanil (major CYP3A4 substrate) compared with those using a previous ontogeny function based on in vitro data (alfentanil: mean squared prediction error 3.0 vs. 6.8; ropivacaine: mean squared prediction error 2.3 vs.14.2).", 
    "14": "When implementing enzyme ontogeny functions, it is important to consider potential confounding factors (e.g. disease) that may affect the physiological conditions of the patient and, hence, the prediction of net in vivo clearance.", 
    "15": "The combination of midazolam and opioid has been widely used as a standard sedative regimen for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Following recent evidence that dexmedetomidine may exert a synergistic effect in combination with midazolam, this study compared the sedative effect and adverse events of midazolam\u200a-\u200ameperidine\u200a-\u200adexmedetomidine (MMD) and midazolam\u200a-\u200ameperidine during ERCP.",

    "19": "Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition, making it an attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine using an anesthetic control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition and a performance-based index of implicit suicidal cognition (Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior.",

Measures were taken at baseline and 24 hr following a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (n = 36) or midazolam (n = 21), a psychoactive placebo agent selected for its similar, rapid anesthetic effects. Twenty four hours postinfusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group.",

    "23": "Biofeedback therapy has been used to treat the symptoms of people with chronic constipation referred to specialist services within secondary and tertiary care settings. However, different methods of biofeedback are used within different centres and the magnitude of suggested benefits and comparable effectiveness of different methods of biofeedback has yet to be established.", 
    "24": "To determine the efficacy and safety of biofeedback for the treatment of chronic idiopathic (functional) constipation in adults.", 
    "25": "We searched the following databases from inception to 16 December 2013: CENTRAL, the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, and PsychINFO. Hand searching of conference proceedings and the reference lists of relevant articles was also undertaken.", 
    "26": "All randomised trials evaluating biofeedback in adults with chronic idiopathic constipation were considered for inclusion.", 
    "27": "The primary outcome was global or clinical improvement as defined by the included studies. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, and adverse events as defined by the included studies. Where possible, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.", 
    "28": "Seventeen eligible studies were identified with a total of 931 participants. Most participants had chronic constipation and dyssynergic defecation. Sixteen of the trials were at high risk of bias for blinding. Attrition bias (4 trials) and other potential bias (5 trials) was also noted. Due to differences between study populations, the heterogeneity of the different samples and large range of different outcome measures, meta-analysis was not possible. Different effect sizes were reported ranging from 40 to 100% of patients who received biofeedback improving following the intervention. While electromyograph (EMG) biofeedback was the most commonly used, there is a lack of evidence as to whether any one method of biofeedback is more effective than any other method of biofeedback. We found low or very low quality evidence that biofeedback is superior to oral diazepam, sham biofeedback and laxatives. One study (n = 60) found EMG biofeedback to be superior to oral diazepam. Seventy per cent (21/30) of biofeedback patients had improved constipation at three month follow-up compared to 23% (7/30) of diazepam patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.51 to 5.98). One study compared manometry biofeedback to sham biofeedback or standard therapy consisting of diet, exercise and laxatives. The mean number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week at three months was 4.6 in the biofeedback group compared to 2.8 in the sham biofeedback group (MD 1.80, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.35; 52 patients). The mean number of CSBM per week at three months was 4.6 in the biofeedback group compared to 1.9 in the standard care group (MD 2.70, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.41; 49 patients). Another study (n = 109) compared EMG biofeedback to conventional treatment with laxatives and dietary and lifestyle advice. This study found that at both 6 and 12 months 80% (43/54) of biofeedback patients reported clinical improvement compared to 22% (12/55) laxative-treated patients (RR 3.65, 95% CI 2.17 to 6.13). Some surgical procedures (partial division of puborectalis and stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR)) were reported to be superior to biofeedback, although with a high risk of adverse events in the surgical groups (wound infection, faecal incontinence, pain, and bleeding that required further surgical intervention). Successful treatment, defined as a decrease in the obstructed defecation score of > 50% at one year was reported in 33% (3/39) of EMG biofeedback patients compared to 82% (44/54) of STARR patients (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.65). For the other study the mean constipation score at one year was 16.1 in the balloon sensory biofeedback group compared to 10.5 in the partial division of puborectalis surgery group (MD 5.60, 95% CI 4.67 to 6.53; 40 patients). Another study (n = 60) found no significant difference in efficacy did not demonstrate the superiority of a surgical intervention (posterior myomectomy of internal anal sphincter and puborectalis) over biofeedback. Conflicting results were found regarding the comparative effectiveness of biofeedback and botulinum toxin-A. One small study (48 participants) suggested that botulinum toxin-A injection may have short term benefits over biofeedback, but the relative effects of treatments were uncertain at one year follow-up. No adverse events were reported for biofeedback, although this was not specifically reported in the majority of studies. The results of all of these studies need to be interpreted with caution as GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes (i.e. clinical or global improvement as defined by the studies) as low or very low due to high risk of bias (i.e. open label studies, self-selection bias, incomplete outcome data, and baseline imbalance) and imprecision (i.e. sparse data).", 
    "29": "Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of biofeedback for the management of people with chronic constipation. We found low or very low quality evidence from single studies to support the effectiveness of biofeedback for the management of people with chronic constipation and dyssynergic defecation. However, the majority of trials are of poor methodological quality and subject to bias. Further well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes, validated outcome measures (especially patient reported outcome measures) and long-term follow-up are required to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn.", 
    "30": "Olanzapine is a first line medication for the treatment of schizophrenia, but it is also one of the atypical antipsychotics carrying the highest risk of weight gain. Metformin was reported to produce significant attenuation of antipsychotic-induced weight gain in patients, while the study of preventing olanzapine-induced weight gain in an animal model is absent. Berberine, an herbal alkaloid, was shown in our previous studies to prevent fat accumulation in vitro and in vivo. Utilizing a well-replicated rat model of olanzapine-induced weight gain, here we demonstrated that two weeks of metformin or berberine treatment significantly prevented the olanzapine-induced weight gain and white fat accumulation. Neither metformin nor berberine treatment demonstrated a significant inhibition of olanzapine-increased food intake. But interestingly, a significant loss of brown adipose tissue caused by olanzapine treatment was prevented by the addition of metformin or berberine. Our gene expression analysis also demonstrated that the weight gain prevention efficacy of metformin or berberine treatment was associated with changes in the expression of multiple key genes controlling energy expenditure. This study not only demonstrates a significant preventive efficacy of metformin and berberine treatment on olanzapine-induced weight gain in rats, but also suggests a potential mechanism of action for preventing olanzapine-reduced energy expenditure.", 
    "31": "Essential tremor (ET) is characterised by postural and action tremors with a frequency of 4-12 Hz. Previous studies suggest that the tremor activity originates in the cerebello-thalamocortical pathways. Alprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that attenuates tremors in ET. The mechanisms that mediate the therapeutic action of alprazolam are unknown; however, in healthy subjects, benzodiazepines increase cortical beta activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of alprazolam both on beta and tremor-related cortical activity and on alterations in tremor presentation in ET patients. Therefore, we characterised the dynamics of tremor and cortical activity in ET patients after alprazolam intake.", 
    "32": "We recorded hand tremors and contralateral cortical activity in four recordings before and after a single dose of alprazolam. We then computed the changes in tremors, cortico-muscular coherence, and cortical activity at the tremor frequency and in the beta band.", 
    "33": "Alprazolam significantly attenuated tremors (EMG: 76.2 \u00b1 22.68%), decreased cortical activity in the tremor frequency range and increased cortical beta activity in all patients (P<0.05). At the same time, the cortico-muscular coherence at the tremor frequency became non-significant (P<0.05). We also found a significant correlation (r = 0.757, P<0.001) between the reduction in tremor severity and the increased ratio of cortical activity in the beta band to the activity observed in the tremor frequency range.", 
    "34": "This study provides the first quantitative analysis of tremor reduction following alprazolam intake. We observed that the tremor severity decreased in association with an increased ratio of beta to tremor-related cortical activity. We hypothesise that the increase in cortical beta activity may act as a blocking mechanism and may dampen the pathological oscillatory activity, which in turn attenuates the observed tremor.",

However, dexmedetomidine premedication reduced systolic blood pressure (three RCTs [242 children]; WMD: -11.47 mm\u00b7Hg(-1) ; 95% CI: -13.95, -8.98), mean blood pressure (three RCTs [202 children]; WMD: -5.66 mm\u00b7Hg(-1) ; 95% CI: -8.89, -2.43), and heart rate (six RCTs [444 children]; WMD: -12.71 beat\u00b7min(-1) ; 95% CI: -14.80, -10.62), and prolonged the onset of sedation (two RCTs [132 children] WMD: 13.78 min; 95% CI: 11.33, 16.23; I(2) = 0%) relative to midazolam.", 
    "48": "This meta-analysis demonstrated that dexmedetomidine premedication is superior to midazolam premedication in terms of producing satisfactory sedation upon parent separation and mask acceptance. Dexmedetomidine premedication provides clinical benefits that included reducing the requirements for rescue analgesia and reducing agitation or delirium and shivering during the postoperative period. However, the risks of heart rate and blood pressure decreases, and the prolonged onset of sedation associated with dexmedetomidine should be considered.",

They have potential to cause biotransformations affecting compound-to-metabolite ratios within the human body, especially after death. Investigation of postmortem effects could supply valuable information, especially concerning compound identification and confirmation. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens on diazepam and flunitrazepam in Reinforced Clostridial Medium, and to compare bacterial biotransformation products to those of human metabolism. A decrease in diazepam concentration between pre- and post-incubation was observed for samples inoculated with Escherichia coli (14.7-20.2%) as well as Bacteroides fragilis (13.9-25.7%); however there was no corresponding increase in concentration for the monitored human metabolites. Flunitrazepam demonstrated a greater concentration loss when incubated with individual bacterial species as well as mixed culture (79.2-100.0%). Samples incubated with Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and mixed culture resulted in nearly complete conversion of flunitrazepam. Increased 7-aminoflunitrazepam concentrations accounted for the majority of the conversion; however discrepancies in the mass balance of the reaction suggested the possibility of a minor metabolite that was not monitored in the current analysis. These experiments served as a pilot study and proof of concept that can be adapted and applied to a realm of possibilities. Ultimately, this methodology would be ideal to study compounds that are too toxic or lethal for animal and human metabolic investigations.",

    "79": "Conscious or moderate sedation is routinely used to facilitate the dental care of the pre- or un-cooperative child. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has little respiratory depressant effect, possibly making it a safer option when used as an adjunct to either opioids or benzodiazepines. Unlike intranasal (IN) midazolam, IN application of DEX and sufentanil (SUF) does not appear to cause much discomfort. Further, although DEX lacks respiratory depressive effects, it is an \u03b12-agonist that can cause hypotension and bradycardia when given in high doses or during prolonged periods of administration. The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively assess IN DEX/SUF as a potential sedation regimen for pediatric dental procedures. After IRB approval and informed consent, children (aged 3-7 years; n = 20) from our dental clinic were recruited. All patients received 2 \u03bcg/kg (max 40 \u03bcg) of IN DEX 45 min before the procedure, followed 30 min later by 1 \u03bcg/kg (max 20 \u03bcg) of IN SUF. An independent observer rated the effects of sedation using the Ohio State University Behavior Rating Scale (OSUBRS) and University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS). The dentist and the parent also assessed the efficacy of sedation. Dental procedures were well tolerated and none were aborted. The mean OSUBRS procedure score was 2.1, the UMSS procedure score was 1.6, and all scores returned to baseline after the procedure. The average dentist rated quality of sedation was 7.6 across the 20 subjects. After discharge, parents reported one child with prolonged drowsiness and one child who vomited at home. The use of IN DEX supplemented with IN SUF provided both an effective and tolerable form of moderate sedation. Although onset and recovery are slower than with oral (PO) midazolam and transmucosal fentanyl, the quality of the sedation may be better with less risk of respiratory depression.

Each of these drugs has a sedative effect on the central nervous system; their combined use could cause an exacerbation of the sedative effects. Amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) can be prescribed to treat nocturnal enuresis; temazepam (a hypnotic) can be used as a premedicant in inpatient and day-case surgery; tramadol (a synthetic opioid analgesic) is used to treat moderate or severe pain, though it is not recommended for children under the age of 12 years and dihydrocodeine (opioid analgesic), which is available in combination with acetaminophen (Co-dydramol), is not recommended for children under the age of 4 years; in children over 4 years, a reduced dose is necessary. The North West Forensic Science Service Laboratory, Euxton, Lancashire, was asked by a British police force to analyze three separate hair samples, which had been collected from a young child following their discovery as a result of a large scale kidnap and false imprisonment investigation.

The entire length of each hair specimen tested positive for amitriptyline and nortriptyline (7-314 pg/mg amitriptyline; 7-318 pg/mg nortriptyline), temazepam (2-29 pg/mg), tramadol (60-2000 pg/mg) and dihydrocodeine (10-90 pg/mg) demonstrating that the child had ingested these drugs on more than one occasion prior to the kidnap. In this case, the child's mother and the mothers' partner were found guilty of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.

In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with AD.

From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin is beneficial to AD patients with moderate to severe dementia and sleep problems. There is some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD.

Benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the gold standard for PTSD treatment, but their side effects pose a serious problem. While regular physical exercise is regarded as a mood elevator and known to enhance cognitive function, its direct role in rescuing core symptoms of PTSD including anxiety and depression-like behaviors and cognitive impairment is unclear. In the present study using the single-prolonged stress (SPS) rat model of PTSD (2h restrain, 20 min forced swimming, 15 min rest, and 1-2 min diethyl ether exposure), we examined the beneficial effect of moderate treadmill exercise on SPS-induced behavioral deficits including anxiety and depression-like behaviors and memory impairment. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups: control (sedentary), exercised, SPS (no exercise), or SPS-exercised. Rats were exercised on a rodent treadmill for 14 consecutive days. Rats in all groups were tested for anxiety-like behaviors using open field (OF), light-dark and elevated-plus maze tests. All rats were tested for short-term and long-term memory in the radial arm water maze test. Rats were then sacrificed, blood was collected (for corticosterone levels), and individual organs (spleen, adrenals, and thymus) harvested. Results suggest that moderate physical exercise ameliorates SPS-induced behavioral deficits in rats.",

Treatment with low nonsedating/nonanxiolytic doses of benzodiazepines, which increase inhibitory neurotransmission through positive allosteric modulation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, improved deficits in social interaction, repetitive behavior, and spatial learning. Moreover, negative allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors impaired social behavior in C57BL/6J and 129SvJ wild-type mice, suggesting that reduced inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to social and cognitive deficits. The dramatic behavioral improvement after low-dose benzodiazepine treatment was subunit specific-the \u03b12,3-subunit-selective positive allosteric modulator L-838,417 was effective, but the \u03b11-subunit-selective drug zolpidem exacerbated social deficits.

Risk of hookah and cigarette use was significantly higher in male students than in female students. Frequency of tobacco use is related with various sociodemographic, psychological and behavioral variables. Our data also shows that using tobacco and alcohol increases the risk of all the other substances use and these effects are interrelated. The data suggest that there is a link between tobacco use and substance use, psychological, behavioral and social factors. There is also a strong association between tobacco use and suicidal behavior as well as self-mutilative, impulsive, hyperactive, delinquent, aggressive and behavioral problems.

    "161": "The aim of the study was to explore differences and similarities between the various non-natural manners of death (accident, suicide, homicide) regarding toxicological findings in illicit drug users. Medicolegal autopsy reports from the Institute of Forensic Medicine University of Oslo concerning deaths from 2000 to 2009 were investigated. Those aged 20-59 whose manner of death was non-natural and who tested positive for any narcotic drug (morphine/heroin, amphetamines, ecstasy, cannabis, LSD, PCP, and high levels of GHB in addition to methadone and buprenorphine) were selected. All substance findings were registered and categorized (narcotics, ethanol, and medicinal products). Of the 1603 autopsies that met the selection criteria, 1204 were accidental intoxications, 122 accidents other than intoxication, 114 suicides by intoxication, 119 non-intoxication suicides, and 44 victims of homicide. Poly drug use was found in all manners of death. The drug profile as well as the mean number of substances (illicit drugs and medicinal products) varied from 2.9 to 4.6 substances per case, depending on the manner of death. Intoxication suicides had the highest number of substances and a total drug profile similar to accidental intoxications. Non-intoxication suicides had a total drug profile similar to homicide and accidents other than intoxication. The number of substances found per case increased during the decade, mainly due to increased findings of methadone, cannabis, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines. Methadone findings increased much more than buprenorphine. Methadone was found 20 times more often than buprenorphine in accidental intoxication cases. In summary, poly drug findings are common in adults who suffer a non-natural death while using illicit drugs. The different manners of death have some specific characteristics and significant differences regarding drug profile.", 
    "162": "Although second-generation antipsychotics induce severe weight gain and obesity, there is a lack of detailed knowledge about the progressive development of antipsychotic-induced obesity. This study examined the hypothalamic histamine H1 receptor and AMP-activated protein kinase (H1R-AMPK) signaling at three distinctive stages of olanzapine-induced weight gain (day 1-12: early acceleration, day 13-28: middle new equilibrium, and day 29-36: late heavy weight maintenance). At the early acceleration stage, the rats were hyperphagic with an underlying mechanism of olanzapine-increased H1R mRNA expression and AMPK phosphorylation (pAMPK), in which pAMPK levels positively correlated with H1R mRNA expression and food intake. At the middle stage, when the rats were no longer hyperphagic, the changes in H1R-AMPK signaling vanished. At the late stage, olanzapine increased H1R mRNA expression but decreased pAMPK which were positively and negatively correlated with weight gain, respectively. These data suggest a time-dependent change of H1R-AMPK signaling, where olanzapine activates AMPK by blocking the H1Rs and causing hyperphagia in the acute phase. The chronic blockade of H1R may contribute to the late stage of olanzapine-induced heavy weight maintenance. However, pAMPK was no longer elevated and actually decreased. This indicates that AMPK acts as an energy sensor and negatively responds to the positive energy balance induced by olanzapine. Furthermore, we showed that an H1R agonist, 2-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl) histamine, can significantly inhibit olanzapine-induced hyperphagia and AMPK activation in the mediobasal hypothalamus in a dose dependent manner. Therefore, lowering H1R-AMPK signaling is an effective treatment for the olanzapine-induced hyperphagia associated with the development of obesity.", 
    "163": "The adverse effects of benzodiazepines on driving are widely recognised. The aims of this study were both to determine the impact of naturalistic conversation on the driving ability of drivers under a benzodiazepine, and to measure the accuracy of drivers' assessments of the joint effects of the benzodiazepine and conversation. Sixteen healthy male participants (29.69 \u00b1 3.30 years) underwent a randomised, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with the benzodiazepine lorazepam (2mg). They drove 200 km (125 miles) on a motorway in the morning. We measured two driving ability-related variables (i.e., lane-keeping performance), and collected a set of self-assessed variables (i.e., self-assessment of driving performance) during two 10-min sequences of interest (no conversation vs. conversation). An analysis of variance revealed an interaction whereby lane-keeping performance under lorazepam was worse in the no-conversation condition than in the conversation condition. No such difference was detected under placebo. Pearson's correlation coefficients revealed that self-assessments were (i) not at all predictive of lane-keeping when performed before the drive, but (ii) moderately predictive of lane-keeping performance when performed during or after the drive. We conclude that conversation with a passenger may contribute to safer lane-keeping when driving under a benzodiazepine. Moreover, a degree of awareness may be attained after some experience of driving under the influence of this type of medication.",

The vascular volume (Vvasc) was sub-normal in 3xTg-AD mice aged from 6 to 18 months, but not in the APP/PS1 mice. The uptakes of [(3)H]-diazepam by the brains of 3xTg-AD, APP/PS1 and their age-matched control mice were similar at all the times studied, suggesting that the simple diffusion of small solutes is unchanged in transgenic animals. The uptake of d-glucose by the brains of 18-month old 3xTg-AD mice, but not by those of 8-month old APP/PS1 mice, was reduced compared to their age-matched controls. Accordingly, the amount of Glut-1 protein was 1.4 times lower in the brain capillaries of 18 month-old 3xTg-AD mice than in those of age-matched control mice. We conclude that the brain vascular volume is reduced early in 3xTg-AD mice, 6 months before the appearance of pathological lesions, and that this reduction persists until they are at least 18 months old. The absence of alterations in the BBB of APP/PS1 mice suggests that hyperphosphorylated tau proteins contribute to the vascular changes that occur in AD.",

In this work, we use the structurally-related clozapine-olanzapine pair to progress in the understanding of the structural properties that determine their divergent binding profiles and, thereby, their differing therapeutic efficacy. First, we present novel site-directed mutagenesis\u00a0results that confirm our previous hypothesis on the importance of ligand interaction with positions 5.42 and 5.46 in transmembrane helix 5. Then, we use refined models of ligand-receptor complexes, built from recently published GPCR crystal structures, to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed experimental outcomes. In particular, we observe that preventing or potentiating hydrogen bonding with position 5.46, could allow obtaining ligands with, respectively, clozapine or olanzapine-like affinities. Results presented in this study could guide the design of antipsychotic candidates with tailored binding profiles.", 
    "166": "Sensing and regulating intracellular levels of calcium are essential for proper cellular function. In neurons, calcium sensing plays important roles in neuronal plasticity, neurotransmitter release, long-term synapse modification and ion channel activity. Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a member of the highly conserved neuronal calcium sensor family. Although NCS-1 has been associated with psychiatric conditions including autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, it is unclear which role NCS-1 plays in behavior. To understand the involvement of NCS-1 in psychiatric conditions, we provided a comprehensive behavioral characterization of NCS-1 knockout (KO) mice. These mice grow and develop normally without apparent abnormalities in comparison to wild type littermates. However, open field showed that NCS-1 deficiency impairs novelty-induced exploratory activity in both KO and heterozygote (HT) mice. Moreover, NCS-1-deficiency also resulted in anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors as demonstrated by elevated plus maze, large open field, forced swim and tail suspension tasks. Furthermore, based on spontaneous object recognition test, non-aversive long-term memory was impaired in NCS-1 KO mice. In contrast, neither social behavior nor a kind of aversive memory was affected under NCS-1 deficiency. These data implicate NCS-1 in exploratory activity, memory and mood-related behaviors, suggesting that NCS-1 gene ablation may result in phenotypic abnormalities associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Disturbances in the balance between these two physiological processes may lead to cell dysfunction or to cell death. Induction of cell death is the prime goal of prostate cancer chemotherapy. Our previous study demonstrated that androgens increase the expression of a mitochondrial protein involved in fission and facilitate an apoptotic response to CGP37157 (CGP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium efflux, in prostate cancer cells. However, the regulation and role of mitochondrial fusion proteins in the death of these cells have not been examined. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the effect of CGP on a key mitochondrial fusion protein, mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), and the role of Mfn1 in prostate cancer cell apoptosis. We used various prostate cancer cell lines and western blot analysis, qRT-PCR, siRNA, M30 apoptosis assay and immunoprecipitation techniques to determine mechanisms regulating Mfn1. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with CGP resulted in selective degradation of Mfn1. Mfn1 ubiquitination was detected following immunoprecipitation of overexpressed Myc-tagged Mfn1 protein from CGP-treated cells, and treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin, as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of the E3 ubiquitin ligase March5, protected Mfn1 from CGP-induced degradation. These data indicate the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in CGP-induced degradation of Mfn1. We also demonstrated that downregulation of Mfn1 by siRNA enhanced the apoptotic response of LNCaP cells to CGP, suggesting a likely pro-survival role for Mfn1 in these cells. Our results suggest that manipulation of mitofusins may provide a novel therapeutic advantage in treating prostate cancer.",

    "211": "The liver is the central organ for detoxification of xenobiotics in the body. In pharmacokinetic modeling, hepatic metabolization capacity is typically quantified as hepatic clearance computed as degradation in well-stirred compartments. This is an accurate mechanistic description once a quasi-equilibrium between blood and surrounding tissue is established. However, this model structure cannot be used to simulate spatio-temporal distribution during the first instants after drug injection. In this paper, we introduce a new spatially resolved model to simulate first pass perfusion of compounds within the naive liver. The model is based on vascular structures obtained from computed tomography as well as physiologically based mass transfer descriptions obtained from pharmacokinetic modeling. The physiological architecture of hepatic tissue in our model is governed by both vascular geometry and the composition of the connecting hepatic tissue. In particular, we here consider locally distributed mass flow in liver tissue instead of considering well-stirred compartments. Experimentally, the model structure corresponds to an isolated perfused liver and provides an ideal platform to address first pass effects and questions of hepatic heterogeneity. The model was evaluated for three exemplary compounds covering key aspects of perfusion, distribution and metabolization within the liver. As pathophysiological states we considered the influence of steatosis and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver necrosis on total hepatic distribution and metabolic capacity. Notably, we found that our computational predictions are in qualitative agreement with previously published experimental data. The simulation results provide an unprecedented level of detail in compound concentration profiles during first pass perfusion, both spatio-temporally in liver tissue itself and temporally in the outflowing blood. We expect our model to be the foundation of further spatially resolved models of the liver in the future.",

Symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders are frequently managed with benzodiazepines, a class of medication often abused. We examined whether HIV-infected patients were more likely to fill a benzodiazepine prescription than their uninfected counterparts using a privately insured, nationally representative sample receiving clinical care between January 2007 and December 2009. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to quantify the likelihood of receiving a benzodiazepine were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models. We examined the presence of interaction between HIV infection and sex using backwards elimination and by comparing stratum-specific OR to identify clinically meaningful differences. Overall, 323,796 beneficiaries were included in the sample, of which 723 were HIV infected. Bivariate analyses showed that compared to the uninfected sample, HIV-infected patients were more likely to have filled a benzodiazepine prescription (24% vs. 19%) during the study period. HIV-infected patients were also more likely to be male (80% vs. 44%), black (21% vs. 7%) and have a diagnosis of depression (12% vs. 8%) or insomnia (6% vs. 3%) than were uninfected patients. Adjusted for other covariates, HIV infection was associated with an increase (OR): 1.68, 95% CI: 1.39, 2.02) in the likelihood of filling a benzodiazepine prescription. When stratified by sex, HIV-infected males were more likely (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.67) than uninfected males to fill a benzodiazepine prescription while there was no observed difference in the likelihood of filling a benzodiazepine prescription between HIV-infected and uninfected females (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.70). Our findings suggest that HIV-infected patients, particularly HIV-infected males, are more likely to fill benzodiazepine prescriptions than their uninfected counterparts, highlighting the need for further research to investigate reasons for these observed differences.",

The goal of the present study was to investigate the responses of isolated human arterial samples to Ca\u00b2\u207a-channel agonists and antagonists by varying the external Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration. Two dihydropyridine type calcium-channel blockers, amlodipine and cerebrocrast, were used in this study. The benzodiazepine-type calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, the benzimidazole derivative 1-acetyl-5,6-dimethoxy-2-methylthiobenzimidazole and 3,4'-bipyridine derivative milrinone were also used. Experiments were carried out on isolated human thoracic artery samples obtained from 74 patients, aged 38-88 years, during conventional myocardial revascularisation operations. The contraction of artery samples was recorded using an iFOT10 force transducer. Cumulative concentration-contraction curves of the tested agents (10\u207b\u2077 to 10\u207b\u2074 M) were established by varying the external Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration from 0.9 mM to 2.7 mM. Cerebrocrast, regardless of the Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration significantly increased arterial contraction, particularly at the lower Ca\u00b2\u207a (\u224877%). Diltiazem, the benzimidazole derivative and milrinone caused the artery samples to relax at 10\u207b\u2074 M concentrations by 55%, 55% and 44%, respectively, when the external Ca\u00b2\u207a corresponded to the physiological standard. Shifting to lower or higher Ca\u00b2\u207a concentrations significantly altered the response of vessel samples by increasing their contraction. In conclusion, the present study shows that the response of isolated human thoracic artery samples to both the slow calcium channel suppressant diltiazem and to agonists of that channel (milrinone and the benzimidazole derivative) is regulated by the amount of calcium present in the physiological solution. Treatment with a slow calcium channel inhibitor, the 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative cerebrocrast, resulted in a response that was independent of the external Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration.",

    "236": "Both alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and benzodiazepines can cause delirium. Benzodiazepine-associated delirium can complicate AWS and prolong hospitalization. Benzodiazepine delirium can be diagnosed with flumazenil, a GABA-A receptor antagonist. By reversing the effects of benzodiazepines, flumazenil is theorized to exacerbate symptoms of AWS and precludes its use. For patients being treated for alcohol withdrawal, flumazenil can diagnose and treat benzodiazepine delirium without precipitating serious or life-threatening adverse events. Hospital admission records were retrospectively reviewed for patients with the diagnosis of AWS who received both benzodiazepines and flumazenil from December 2006 to June 2012 at a university-affiliated inpatient toxicology center. The day of last alcohol consumption was estimated from available blood alcohol content or subjective history. Corresponding benzodiazepine, flumazenil, and adjunctive sedative pharmacy records were reviewed, as were demographic, clinical course, and outcome data. Eighty-five patients were identified (average age 50.3\u00a0years). Alcohol concentrations were detectable for 42 patients with average 261\u00a0mg/dL (10-530\u00a0mg/dL). Eighty patients were treated with adjunctive agents for alcohol withdrawal including antipsychotics (n\u2009=\u200957), opioids (n\u2009=\u200927), clonidine (n\u2009=\u200935), and phenobarbital (n\u2009=\u200923). Average time of flumazenil administration was 4.7\u00a0days (1-11\u00a0days) after abstinence, and average dose was 0.5\u00a0mg (0.2-1\u00a0mg). At the time of flumazenil administration, delirium was described as hypoactive (n\u2009=\u200921), hyperactive (n\u2009=\u200915), mixed (n\u2009=\u200941), or not specified (n\u2009=\u20098). Response was not documented in 11 cases. Sixty-two (72.9\u00a0%) patients had significant objective improvement after receiving flumazenil. Fifty-six patients required more than one dose (average 5.6 doses). There were no major adverse events and minor adverse effects included transiently increased anxiety in two patients: 1 patient who received 0.5\u00a0mg on abstinence day 2 and another patient who received 0.2\u00a0mg flumazenil on abstinence day 11. This is the largest series diagnosing benzodiazepine delirium after AWS in patients receiving flumazenil. During the treatment of AWS, if delirium is present on day 5, a test dose of flumazenil may be considered to establish benzodiazepine delirium. With the limited data set often accompanying patients with AWS, flumazenil diagnosed benzodiazepine delirium during the treatment of AWS and improved impairments in cognition and behavior without serious or life-threatening adverse events in our patients.", 
    "237": "Drug-drug interactions (DDI) are a major topic in programs for continuous medical education (CME). Many physicians are afraid of being trapped into charges of malpractice; however, DDI cannot be avoided in many cases. They belong to routine medical practice and it is often impossible to avoid them. Moreover, they do not just occur between drugs but between any kind of foreign substance (xenobiotica), such as food (e.g. grapefruit juice, broccoli, barbecue) as well as legal (e.g. tobacco smoke, caffeine and alcohol) and illegal drugs. Therefore, the medical challenge is not just to avoid any interaction. Instead the physician faces the question of how to proceed with drug treatment in the presence of such interactions. Based on the medical education a physician has to judge first of all whether there is a risk for interactions in the prescription being planned for an individual patient. The classification of interactions proposed in this article (PD1-PD4, PK1-PK3) might help as a sort of check list. For more detailed information the physician can then consult one of the many databases available on the internet, such as PSIAConline (http://www.psiac.de) and MediQ (http://www.mediq.ch). Pharmacokinetic interactions can be easily assessed, monitored and controlled by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Besides these tools it is important to keep in mind that nobody knows everything; even physicians do not know everything. So take pride in asking someone who might help and for this purpose AGATE offers a drug information service AID (http://www.amuep-agate.de). Just good for nothing, without being based on any kind of medical approach are computer programs that judge prescriptions without taking into account a patient's individual peculiarities. In case these types of programs produce red exclamation marks or traffic lights to underline their judgment, they might even work in a contrapuntal way by just eliciting insecurity and fear.",

Some cases of abuse and misuse, especially associated with various benzodiazepines (BZDs), have been described, and a previous study has shown that BZDs increase the sedative effect of BPN and decrease its anxiogenic properties. To investigate the reward effect that may lead to the abusive combination of BPN and BZD, we studied the influence of different doses of three BZDs extensively used with BPN by drug addicts on conditioned place preference behavior in mice. BPN (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously into male mice alone or in combination with a BZD administered intraperitoneally: dipotassium clorazepate (CRZ; 1, 4, 16 mg/kg), diazepam (DAZ; 0.5, 1, 5 mg/kg), or bromazepam (BMZ; 0.5, 1, 3 mg/kg). Amphetamine (8 mg/kg) was used as a reference drug. Reward effects of BPN alone or in combination were measured in a conditioned place preference paradigm using an unbiased procedure. Our results showed that groups treated with BPN associated with different doses of diazepam and clorazepate, but not bromazepam, spent significantly more time in the drug-paired compartment compared to the group treated with BPN alone. Our study shows that joint consumption of diazepam and clorazepate, but not bromazepam, can increase the reward properties of BPN alone in mice. These results could help to explain the use of this type of drug combination in the drug addict population.",

Tetrahydrocannabinol was found in samples from 0.5% (95% CI 0.3-0.8) of drivers in Brazil and 1.0% (95% CI 0.6-1.5) in Norway, whereas benzodiazepines or zopiclone were found in 1.0% (95% CI 0.7-1.4) and 1.7% (95% CI 1.2-2.4) of the samples from Brazil and Norway, respectively.", 
    "260": "The difference in the prevalence of alcohol may be related to the fact that Norway has implemented steps to reduce drunk driving since 1936, whereas Brazil has attempted to do the same for only a few years. Differences for drugs may be related to different patterns in the use of stimulants, cannabis and medicines.", 
    "261": "Cuprizone (CPZ) induced demyelinating mouse has been used as an animal model to examine the assumed roles of altered oligodendrocytes in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, on cuprizone-induced neuropathological changes in the frontal cortex of C57BL/6 mice, and to explore the underlying mechanism for the possible protective effects. The effects of six-week olanzapine (10 mg/kg/day) treatments on neuropathological changes were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western-blot analyses. Olanzapine treatment for six weeks effectively decreased the breakdown of myelin and oligodendrocytes loss of cuprizone-fed mice. Reactive cellular changes, including astrocyte gliosis, microglia accumulation and increased activation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, were also attenuated by olanzapine. However, the cortical expression level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was significantly increased by olanzapine treatment in cuprizone-fed mice as measured by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Olanzapine treatment in control mice consuming normal food had no effect on all above measures. These results provide the first in vivo evidence for the protective effects of olanzapine on cuprizone-induced neuropathological changes and suggest that up-regulated insulin-like growth factor 1 may contribute to the protective effects of this antipsychotic.", 
    "262": "Three new pyrrolobenzodiazepine derivatives, boseongazepines A-C (1-3), were isolated from a culture broth of Streptomyces sp. 11A057, together with the known compound usabamycin B (4). The structures of 1-4 were determined through the analysis of spectroscopic data including extensive 1D-, 2D-NMR, and MS techniques. Cell growth inhibition effects of these compounds were evaluated against Jurkat, K-562, HL-60, and HepG2 cell lines.", 
    "263": "Stress stability testing represents an important part of the drug development process. It is used as an important tool for the identification of degradation products and degradation pathways, as well as for the assessment of changes in physical form of drug molecules. The impact of excipients on the stability of olanzapine confirms that levels of impurities and degradants are limiting parameters and are therefore used for stability evaluation. The major degradation product of olanzapine was identified as 2-methyl-5,10-dihydro-4H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine-4-one (III). The structure of III was determined by using LC-MS, IR and NMR. Compatibility and stress stability results demonstrated that tablet formulations of olanzapine are sensitive to temperature and moisture. In samples protected from moisture, the increase in concentration of III was shown to be highly temperature dependent and the degradation followed zero-order kinetics. In addition, studies of olanzapine with excipients and in formulated tablets revealed polymorphic phase changes in some samples, influenced by a combination of stress temperature and humidity conditions. Polymorphic transitions were monitored using x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis and exhibited no correlation between the phase change (appearance of a new polymorph) and the degradation process.", 
    "264": "The clearance of sedatives and analgesics may be reduced by therapeutic hypothermia. However, little is known about the concentrations of such drugs during rewarming. The aim of this study was to describe the serum concentrations of sedatives and analgesics during rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia.", 
    "265": "Blood samples were collected for quantification of drug concentrations in 22 patients given analgesia/sedation with either remifentanil/propofol or fentanyl/midazolam during rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia (33-34\u00b0C) after cardiac arrest. Samples for were drawn before (-2 h) and during rewarming (0-8 h). Linear mixed effects models were used to describe serum concentrations and adjust for rates of infusion during rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia.", 
    "266": "Subjects with samples analyzed were remifentanil (n = 8), propofol (n = 14), fentanyl (n = 8), and midazolam (n = 8). Age, body mass index, and simplified acute physiology score II [mean (standard deviation)] were 64 (14.2) years, 27.3 (3.7) kg/m(2), and 69 (13.2), respectively. While the concentration of fentanyl was not significantly affected by temperature, concentrations of remifentanil, propofol, and midazolam decreased with core temperature by 16%, 12%, and 11% (mean values) from 33\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C after adjusting for rates of infusion, respectively.", 
    "267": "Concentrations of remifentanil, propofol, and midazolam decreased during rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia when adjusting for rates of infusion. No changes were demonstrated for fentanyl.", 
    "268": "Symptoms of anxiety are common in patients with depression. In this retrospective case series we investigated the effect of Pregabalin as an add-on medication in unipolar depressed patients with high levels of anxiety. The therapeutic effect of Pregabalin showed a fast onset and was comparable to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines.", 
    "269": "Anxiety commonly co-occurs with bipolar disorders (BDs), but the significance of such \"co-morbidity\" remains to be clarified and its optimal treatment adequately defined.", 
    "270": "We reviewed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment studies of the co-occurrence of BD and anxiety disorder through electronic searching of Pubmed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.", 
    "271": "Nearly half of BD patients meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at some time, and anxiety is associated with poor treatment responses, substance abuse, and disability. Reported rates of specific anxiety disorders with BD rank: panic \u2265 phobias \u2265 generalized anxiety \u2265 posttraumatic stress \u2265 obsessive-compulsive disorders. Their prevalence appears to be greater among women than men, but similar in types I and II BD. Anxiety may be more likely in depressive phases of BD, but relationships of anxiety phenomena to particular phases of BD, and their temporal distributions require clarification. Adequate treatment trials for anxiety syndromes in BD patients remain rare, and the impact on anxiety of treatments aimed at mood stabilization is not clear. Benzodiazepines are sometimes given empirically; antidepressants are employed cautiously to limit risks of mood switching and emotional destabilization; lamotrigine, valproate, and second-generation antipsychotics may be useful and relatively safe.", 
    "272": "Anxiety symptoms and syndromes co-occur commonly in patients with BD, but \"co-morbid\" phenomena may be part of the BD phenotype rather than separate illnesses."
