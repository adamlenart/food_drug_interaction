    "1": "Ten adult patients aged 20 to 44 years with Tourette's disorder were treated using an open-label, flexible dosing schedule for 8 weeks. Three patients who continued olanzapine were reevaluated after 6 months. Three subjects were psychotropic medication naive, 5 patients experienced intolerable side effects with conventional neuroleptics, and 2 patients had remote (> or = 10 years) successful response to conventional neuroleptics. Tic severity was rated by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale; weight, vital signs, and adverse effects were assessed weekly. Electrocardiogram, laboratory studies, and comorbid symptoms, assessed by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults, were measured at baseline and at week 8.", 
    "2": "Two of 10 patients prematurely discontinued olanzapine owing to excessive sedation. Of 8 patients who completed the 8-week trial, 4 (50%) demonstrated reduction of global tic severity scores by > or = 20 points, and 6 (75%) demonstrated reductions by > or = 10 points. No significant changes in comorbid symptoms were demonstrated. Sedation, weight gain, increased appetite, dry mouth, and transient asymptomatic hypoglycemia were the most common side effects. Tic improvements were maintained in 3 patients reassessed 6 months later. Final olanzapine dosages ranged from 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily (mean = 10.9 mg/day).",

    "5": "In a 3-week, double-blind study of patients with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder, olanzapine was superior to placebo for the treatment of acute manic symptoms. Of the 139 patients who entered the double-blind phase of the 3-week study, 113 patients continued into the 49-week open-label extension. Efficacy measurements including the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21), the Clinical Global Impressions scale-Bipolar Version, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and safety measurements including the Simpson-Angus scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were completed throughout. The analysis considered all treatment results, starting with the first olanzapine dose. Adjunctive lithium and fluoxetine were allowed during the open-label extension.", 
    "6": "The mean length of olanzapine treatment was 6.6 months, with a mean modal dose of 13.9 mg/day. A significant mean improvement in the YMRS total score, baseline to endpoint (-18.01, p < .001), was observed. During treatment, 88.3% of patients experienced a remission of manic symptoms (YMRS total score < or =12), and only 25.5% subsequently relapsed (YMRS total score > or = 15). Significant improvement in HAM-D-21 scores was observed (p < .001). Forty-one percent of patients were maintained on olanzapine monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported were somnolence (46.0%), depression (38.9%), and weight gain (36.3%).",

Effects of 8 clinically relevant covariates--therapy, clinical outcome (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), baseline body mass index (BBMI), increased appetite, age, gender, race, and dose--on weight were compared.", 
    "10": "In study 1, olanzapine (vs. haloperidol) therapy, better clinical outcome, lower BBMI, and nonwhite race significantly affected weight gain. Effects of increased appetite and male gender on weight gain were significant for olanzapine but not for haloperidol. In study 2, better clinical outcome, lower BBMI, and younger age significantly affected weight gain. Increased appetite was more frequent during olanzapine treatment than during haloperidol, but not significantly different from risperidone. Significant differences in effect on weight change were found between olanzapine and haloperidol but not between olanzapine and risperidone. No evidence was found that lower antipsychotic drug doses were associated with lower weight gain.", 
    "11": "This report identifies predictive factors of acute weight change in patients with schizophrenia. Similar factors across antipsychotic drugs in predicting greater weight gain included better clinical outcome, low BBMI, and nonwhite race. Factors differing between conventional (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine) agents included increased appetite and gender. Choice of atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine vs. risperidone) was of minor importance with regard to influence on acute weight gain.",

Hypothesis testing is the most widely employed method of determining whether the outcome of clinical trials is positive or negative. Too often, however, neither the hypothesis nor the statistical information necessary to evaluate outcomes, such as p values and alpha levels, is stated explicitly in reports of clinical trials. This article examines 5 recent studies comparing atypical antipsychotics with special attention to how they approach the hypothesis and hypothesis testing. Alternative approaches are also discussed.", 
    "13": "There is little information concerning the carbon dioxide-related effects on respiratory mechanics in anesthetized, paralyzed subjects; however, hypocapnia or hypercapnia is often permitted in patients with severe brain injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, the carbon dioxide dependence of respiratory mechanics in healthy anesthetized, paralyzed subjects was investigated.", 
    "14": "Interrupter resistance (Rint), additional tissue viscoelastic resistance (deltaR), and quasi-static elastance (Est) of lung (L) and chest wall were assessed by means of the rapid end-inspiratory occlusion method in two groups of seven healthy paralyzed subjects anesthetized with diazepam or isoflurane. They underwent ventilation with a fixed pattern and hyperoxic gas mixtures with different fractions of inspired carbon dioxide (FICO2) to produce a partial pressures of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 24.4 +/- 3.4, 39.6 +/- 3.2, and 62 +/- 4.1 (SD) mmHg.", 
    "15": "Chest wall mechanics and Est,L were unaffected by PaCO2 changes. With diazepam anesthesia, Rint,L decreased linearly, with increasing PaCO2, from 2.3 to 1.4 cm H2O.s.l(-1), whereas deltaR,L decreased from 2 to 1.7 cm H2O.s.l(-1), though not significantly. With isoflurane anesthesia, the decrease of Rint,L (0.2 +/- 0.5 cm H2O.s.l(-1)) was not significant, and deltaRL remained unchanged. With diazepam, Rint,L was 45 (hypercapnia) to 110% (hypocapnia) greater than with isoflurane.", 
    "16": "Changes of PaCO2 from 20-65 mmHg cause increasing bronchodilation in anesthetized, paralyzed subjects, this effect being attenuated or abolished by drugs (e.g., halogenated anesthetics) that depress smooth muscle tone substantially. The carbon dioxide bronchodilating effects are probably direct for peripheral structures and are paralleled by a tendency of lung tissue resistance to decrease. Because local PaCO2-related changes in bronchomotor tone promote VA/Q matching, this mechanism should be impaired by anesthetics that cause bronchodilation.", 
    "17": "A patient diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) carried out prospective ratings of depression weekly for nearly a decade. A winter peak of depression and benzodiazepine intake was documented. However, over the years, the depressive episodes shifted toward spring in an apparent free-running circannual rhythm (periodogram peaks at 53 and 55 weeks). This patient may have an underlying seasonal propensity to depression no longer precisely entrained to environmental cues.", 
    "18": "Studying the behavioral phenotypes of transgenic and gene knockout mice is a powerful means to better understand the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and ultimately improve their treatment. This paper provides an overview of the methods and findings of studies that have tested for anxiety-related behavioral phenotypes in gene mutant mice. In the context of improving the side effect burden of benzodiazepines, gene targeting has been valuable for dissociating the functional roles (i.e., anxiolytic, sedative, amnestic) of individual GABA(A) receptor subunits. Supporting the link between abnormalities in CRH function and anxiety, CRH overexpressing transgenic mice and CRH-R2 receptor knockout mutants have displayed significantly increased anxiety-like behavior, while CRH-R1 receptor knockout mice have shown an anxiolytic-like phenotype. Consistent with an important role for the serotonergic system in anxiety, 5-HT1(A) receptor deficient mice have consistently exhibited heightened anxiety-like behavior, while the evidence from 5-HT1(B) and 5-HT2(C) deficient mice remains somewhat equivocal. Mutant mice lacking either of the monoamine degrading enzymes, MAOA or COMT, have shown a number of behavioral and neurological effects, including alterations in anxiety-like behavior. With enhanced spatial and temporal control over gene mutations, in combination with an improved battery of behavioral tests, gene mutant mice will provide an increasingly valuable tool for understanding the neural substrates of anxiety.", 
    "19": "The open field test (OFT) is a widely used procedure for examining the behavioral effects of drugs and anxiety. Detailed ethological assessments of animal behavior are lacking. Here we present a detailed ethological assessment of the effects of acute treatment with the benzodiazepines, diazepam (DZ, 1.5mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5.0 and 10.0mg/kg), as well as exposure to a non-pharmacological agent, a specific pulsed extremely low frequency magnetic field (MAG) on open field behavior. We examined the duration, frequency and time course of various behaviors (i.e. exploration, walk, rear, stretch attend, return, groom, sit, spin turn, jump and sleep) exhibited by male mice in different regions of a novel open field. Both DZ and CDP consistently reduced the typical anxiety-like behaviors of stretch attend and wall-following (thigmotaxis), along with that of an additional new measure: 'returns', without producing any overall effects on total locomotion. The drugs also differed in their effects. CDP elicited a shift in the locomotor pattern from a 'high explore' to a 'high walk', while DZ mainly elicited alterations in sit and groom. The MAG treatment was repeated twice with both exposures reducing horizontal and vertical (rearing) activity and increasing grooming and spin turns. However, the anxiety-like behaviors of stretch attend and return were marginally reduced by only the first exposure. We conclude that a detailed ethological analysis of the OFT allows not only the detection of specific effects of drugs and non-pharmacological agents (i.e. pulsed magnetic field) on anxiety-like behaviors, but also permits the examination of non-specific effects, in particular those on general activity.", 
    "20": "This study aimed at developing a rat model of obsessive compulsive disorder based on the hypothesis that a deficient response feedback mechanism underlies obsessions and compulsions. Rats were trained to lever press for food, whose delivery was signaled by the presentation of a compound stimulus (light+tone). Subsequently, the classical contingency between the stimulus and food was extinguished (signal attenuation). Experiment 1 showed that this manipulation resulted in increased lever pressing during a subsequent extinction test, which was highly correlated with an increase in the number of trials on which the rat did not attempt to collect the food reward. This behavioral pattern was not evident in an extinction test not preceded by signal attenuation (Experiment 2), suggesting that the latter is a crucial factor in the development of this behavioral pattern. Excessive lever pressing was attenuated by the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg; Experiment 3), but not by the anxiolytic drug, diazepam (2 mg/kg; Experiment 4). Based on these results we propose that post-training signal attenuation may provide a rat model of obsessive compulsive disorder.", 
    "21": "We investigated the effects of in ovo chronic administration of the endogenous neurosteroid epipregnanolone (5beta-pregnan-3beta-ol-20-one) on the GABA(A) receptor complex present in chick optic lobe synaptic membranes. Chronic epipregnanolone treatment failed to exert any effect on the chick optic lobe total protein content and wet weight at the different doses tested. [3H]Flunitrazepam control binding remained unaltered after neurosteroid exposure, however, the positive allosteric modulation of this ligand by 4 microM allopregnanolone was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by neurosteroid treatment. Embryo exposure to 30 microM epipregnanolone decreased allopregnanolone EC(50) and E(max) values. Analyses of saturation binding isotherms disclosed that such administration had no effect on K(d) and B(max) values for [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]GABA binding. [3H]GABA binding modulation disclosed an increase in allopregnanolone EC(50) value with a decrease in its E(max) value. Diazepam EC(50) and E(max) values were enhanced, while low affinity sodium pentobarbital EC(50) value was reduced by epipregnanolone treatment. The investigation of the GABA(A) receptor function revealed that administration of this neurosteroid reduces the efficacy of GABA to induce 36Cl(-) influx into microsacs prepared from chick optic lobe. These results indicate that endogenous neurosteroid epipregnanolone chronically administered in ovo produces homologous uncoupling between steroid modulatory sites, and those corresponding to benzodiazepine and GABA receptors. Thus epipregnanolone is able to induce heterologous changes in the allosteric linkage between benzodiazepine and barbiturate modulatory sites, and the GABA receptor site. Taken jointly with results on epipregnanolone enhancing effects on [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]GABA binding, in the context of its endogenous synthesis, our present findings support this neurosteroid as the endogenous modulator of GABA(A) receptor sites and function during chick optic lobe development.",

    "23": "Patients seeking acute treatment for alcohol withdrawal at St. G\u00f6ran's hospital in Stockholm were evaluated for known risk factors for alcohol withdrawal delirium. All patients with any risk factor were admitted to the hospital and received standard treatment with benzodiazepines. All patients were evaluated at admission by the physician in charge at the psychiatric and dependency emergency unit at the hospital. Treatment and final assessment were conducted at the unit's inpatient acute-treatment facility. Correlations were determined between risk factors noted at admission and development of alcohol withdrawal delirium, as defined in DSM-IV, after admission. A total of 334 alcohol-dependent patients were included in the study.", 
    "24": "Twenty-three patients, or 6.9 percent, developed alcohol withdrawal delirium after admission despite benzodiazepine treatment. In a stepwise multiple regression model, five risk factors were significantly correlated with the development of alcohol withdrawal delirium: current infectious disease; tachycardia, defined as a heart rate above 120 beats per minute at admission; signs of alcohol withdrawal accompanied by an alcohol concentration of more than 1 gram per liter of body fluid; a history of epileptic seizures; and a history of delirious episodes. No patient without these five risk factors developed delirium.",

    "26": "A sedative dose of midazolam decreases contractility of the diaphragm, but no data are available concerning the relationship between dose and diaphragmatic contractility. We studied the dose-response characteristics of midazolam for reducing the diaphragmatic contractility in dogs. Animals were divided into three groups of eight each: Group 1 received no study drug, Group 2 was infused with a sedative dose of midazolam (0.1 mg/kg initial dose plus 0.1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) maintenance dose), and Group 3 was infused with an anesthetic dose of midazolam (0.1 mg/kg initial dose plus 0.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) maintenance dose). We assessed the diaphragmatic contractility by transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). With an infusion of midazolam in Groups 2 and 3, Pdi at low-frequency (20 Hz) and high-frequency (100 Hz) stimulation decreased from the baseline values (P < 0.05), and the integrated electrical activity of diaphragm (Edi) at 100-Hz stimulation decreased from the baseline values, whereas Edi at 20-Hz stimulation did not change. Compared with Group 1, Pdi and Edi for each stimulus decreased during midazolam infusion in Groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.05). The decrease in Pdi and Edi was more in Group 3 than in Group 2 (P < 0.05). We conclude that midazolam decreases, in a dose-dependent manner, contractility of the diaphragm in dogs.", 
    "27": "Increasing evidence points to the possible risks of delayed effects upon prenatal exposure to chemicals; the evaluation of such effects may pose serious problems to clinicians, epidemiologists and toxicologists. In fact, several systems (e.g., nervous, excretory) show important developmental processes well after the organogenetic period, up to the postnatal phase; accordingly, these are also expected to be sensitive targets of developmental toxicants, resulting in impairment of the function and/or functional reserve. This review describes the effects of several groups of drugs on the functional maturation and histogenesis of the kidney (e.g., aminoglycosides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, indomethacin) and brain (e.g., anticonvulsivants, antiretroviral compounds, benzodiazepines) upon exposure in utero of humans and laboratory animals. The available data stress the importance for risk assessment of an adequate knowledge of both developmental biology and mechanisms of toxicity. The design of developmental toxicity studies should allow an evaluation of targets most relevant for a given drug (or group of drugs); moreover, the analysis of functional development should receive the due attention within the safety assessment of chemicals.",

Post boc analysis demonstrated that patient-controlled analgesia consumption was significantly lower in the treatment group only during the first 4 h of patient-controlled analgesia use after surgery (P = 0.027). There were no significant group differences at any later postoperative time points (P = not significant). There were no group differences in the cumulative Percocet (Pfizer, New York, NY) consumption in the postoperative period (P = not significant).

    "52": "The present study used the event-related brain potential (ERP) technique to investigate this hypothesis. The P3b component to targets was taken as an indicator of the target evaluation process, and the response-locked error-related negativity (ERN) served as an indicator of action monitoring. We hypothesized that the amplitudes of ERN and P3b would be reduced as an effect of oxazepam.", 
    "53": "A simple \"oddball\" reaction time experiment was conducted in a double-blind crossover study of 30 mg oxazepam versus placebo. In order to investigate variations in attentional allocation, separate experimental runs were undertaken with target frequencies of 50% and 80%.",

However, postmortem changes can denature this matrix, resulting in a loss or degradation of drugs, thus biasing analytical findings. Vitreous humor is thought to be less affected by these changes and should, therefore, have the potential to provide a more reliable estimation of antemortem drug concentrations. To assess the usefulness of vitreous humor for the analysis of benzodiazepine drugs, vitreous humor and whole blood were obtained postmortem in 27 cases. Three benzodiazepine drugs were investigated-temazepam, diazepam, and desmethyldiazepam. For temazepam and diazepam, some correlation was found between the matrices (R2 = 0.789 and 0.724, respectively). However, for desmethyldiazepam, no correlation was observed (R2 = 0.068). Regression analysis on plots of vitreous humor versus blood concentrations produced gradients of less than 1.0 showing that, in general, levels in blood are higher than the corresponding levels in vitreous humor.", 
    "57": "To investigate putative differences in CYP3A activity between European American and Japanese subjects using midazolam as an in vivo probe.", 
    "58": "Midazolam was administered orally (2 mg) to 22 young healthy Japanese men and, on a separate occasion, to 19 of these by the intravenous route (1 mg). The disposition of the drug and its 1'-hydroxy metabolite were determined and compared with data collected in a similar fashion in 20 young healthy European American men.", 
    "59": "Plasma concentrations of midazolam, especially those attained soon after drug administration, were higher after intravenous injection in Japanese subjects than those in European American men. This observation was associated with smaller initial (2.5-fold) and steady-state (1.8-fold) volumes of distribution for the drug; normalization for body weight only modestly reduced these differences. The systemic clearance value of midazolam was 25% lower (P < .03) in Japanese subjects, but this difference was not apparent after accounting for the smaller body weights of that group. No statistical differences were noted in the elimination half-life (t 1/2) of midazolam between European American and Japanese subjects. Much greater interindividual variability was observed after oral administration compared with intravenous administration, but significant differences were not found between the 2 groups with respect to the maximum midazolam plasma level or its oral clearance. Absolute oral bioavailability and its associated gastrointestinal and hepatic extraction ratios also showed no statistically significant interracial differences.", 
    "60": "On average, hepatic CYP3A, as measured by the metabolism of midazolam, is lower in young healthy Japanese men compared with similar European Americans. However, there is considerable interindividual variability, and body size appears to be an important determinant. After oral administration, even greater variability in the plasma level-time profile of midazolam is present, and no statistically significant or clinically important interracial/ethnic difference is present. Possibly because of smaller body mass and differences in body composition, midazolam has a smaller distribution volume(s) in Japanese men than in European American men that might be an important factor when drugs are administered intravenously.",

Olanzapine is a novel atypical antipsychotic with affinity for a number of neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine D1, D2, D4, serotonin 5HT2A, 5HT2C, histamine H1, a1-adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors. 2. A neuroendocrinological method to check the degree of dopamine receptor blocking is by measuring the prolactin (PRL) responses to acute (i.m.) administration of haloperidol (HAL). The authors applied this test in a group of male patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia in the drug-free state. The patients were subsequently treated with olanzapine (OLZ) (mean daily dose: 22.5+/-5.8) and the test was repeated six weeks later. For the HAL-test, 5mg HAL were injected i.m. and blood samples were taken at times 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Fourteen patients enrolled in the study. Psychopathology was assessed by means of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). 3. Six weeks treatment with OLZ resulted in significant decreases in the total BPRS score and on the score of its subscales for positive, negative, and general psychopathology. Comparison of the PRL response patterns, after HAL administration by analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVAR) for drug treatment and time, revealed a highly significant time effect (F=28.98, p=0.000) and a significant treatment by time interaction (F=8.27, p=0.000008). Namely, in the drug-free state significant increases were found in the PRL levels after i.m. HAL administration which were significantly reduced during treatment with OLZ, indicating moderate receptor blockade.", 
    "62": "To predict, quantitatively, the extent of drug interaction during repeated administration of a metabolic inhibitor, we analysed the effects of erythromycin treatment under several regimens on the area under the concentration curve (AUC) of midazolam in rats. Midazolam was administered into the portal vein 12 h after erythromycin treatment for 1, 2 or 3 days, or 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h after erythromycin treatment for 4 days, and the plasma-concentration profiles of midazolam were analysed to assess the AUC. Moreover, the contents of total cytochrome P450 and inactive metabolic intermediate (MI) complex were simultaneously quantitated. While the AUC value of midazolam was not affected by the administration of erythromycin for 1 day, repeated administration of erythromycin evoked an increase in AUC ratio (AUC in erythromycin-treated rats/AUC in vehicle-treated rats), which reached a maximum value of 1.99 at 12 h after 4 days' treatment with erythromycin. The total content of cytochrome P450 in liver microsomes was unaffected by erythromycin treatment. Although the MI complex was undetectable after 1 day's treatment with erythromycin, its content increased with duration of erythromycin treatment, and the complex disappeared after the end of erythromycin treatment with a half-life of 12.3 h. In conclusion, the interaction between erythromycin and midazolam could be well predicted when the formation of MI complex in the liver was taken into account.",

    "64": "A series of 6-substituted 2-aryl-N,N-dimethylimidazol[1,2-a] pyridine-3-acetamides, congeners of zolpidem and alpidem, was synthesized and tested in vitro for binding with the benzodiazepine receptor in the competition with 3H-zolpidem as an omega 1-selective radioligand. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and the HOMO and LUMO energies were calculated for the compounds by semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods. The lipophilicity parameter of the compounds, expressed as the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), was calculated; alternatively, standard values of the Hansch hydrophobic substituent constants pi were used. In agreement with earlier investigations on the benzodiazepine receptor ligands with a high preference for the omega 1-subtype, a quantitative correlation of the biological data with molecular parameters has revealed a significant dependence (r = 0.954) of the binding affinity (IC50) on the deepest MEP minimum, in this case associated with the amide carbonyl oxygen atom. The lipophilicity parameters were found to be of lower significance.",

The uptake of [11C]MPDX by the AA(1) receptors in the contralateral SC decreased by about 67% on day 5 after enucleation and remained low thereafter. In the contralateral VC, the uptake of [14C]deoxyglucose decreased immediately after the enucleation followed by a gradual recovery, whereas the uptake of [11C]flumazenil and [11C]MPDX was not altered.",

    "71": "The regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission by endogenously released glutamate was studied in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. After 7 days in vitro (DIV), both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) could be detected. After 15 DIV, most postsynaptic spontaneous currents occurred as sEPSC/sIPSC sequences when recorded at a holding voltage of -30 mV. In the presence of the glutamate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subtype antagonist LY303070, both the frequency and amplitude of sIPSC were strongly and reversibly reduced. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), had no effect on sIPSC while cyclothiazide strongly increased sIPSC frequency. Under blockade of AMPA receptors, the kainate- and GluR5-selective kainate receptor agonists, (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid) (ATPA) and (S)-5-iodowillardiine (5IWill), induced a large enhancement of the frequency of small-amplitude sIPSC which was blocked by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist, 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX). All of these effects were sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX). In the presence of LY303070 and TTX, kainate could induce a small inward current while GluR5 agonists had no effect. In the presence of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists, the glutamate uptake inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (t-PDC) could restore sIPSC. When NBQX was used as an AMPA antagonist, the stimulatory effect of t-PDC was blocked while the group I metabotropic glutamate agonist, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), induced a strong enhancement of sIPSC. Therefore, both AMPA and kainate receptors can regulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons, the former by tonic activation, the latter when the glutamate concentration is increased by impairing glutonate uptake.", 
    "72": "This study examined the behavioral effects of agents active at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor complex in the mouse staircase paradigm. The neuroactivesteroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were compared with the benzodiazepine agonist clonazepam, the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic compound zopiclone, and the antiepileptic agent gabapentin. Clonazepam, zopiclone and gabapentin reduced rearing activity at doses that did not affect climbing. The rearing-suppression effect of clonazepam and zopiclone, but not of gabapentin, was blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, suggesting that the added effect of gabapentin is not mediated by the benzodiazepine receptor on the GABA complex. DHEA suppressed rearing behavior at doses that did not reduce climbing, but analysis with the Bonferroni post hoc test yielded no statistically significant difference. This inhibitory effect was attenuated by flumazenil. By contrast, DHEA-S suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, both rearing and climbing behavior to the same extent. The findings support the potential value of the mouse staircase paradigm for demonstrating behaviorally relevant anxiolysis of test compounds shown to interact in vitro with the GABA(A) receptor complex.", 
    "73": "A new computer system (including hardware and software design) was developed which could be used to record and analyze the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. The EEG analog signal of four channels was first digitized at a sampling rate of 960 Hz through analog to digital converter and then stored in the Sun-386 computer for off-line analysis. Various EEG effect parameters were then generated from the aperiodic waveform analysis files, i.e., total number of waves/s and total voltage/s in various frequency ranges 1-3, 4-7, 4-11, and 12-30 Hz. From various EEG parameters derived from computer system, the total number or voltage in 12-30 Hz (TNW12-30, TV12-30) was considered as the best descriptor of EEG effect.", 
    "74": "The alpha1beta2gamma2 is the most abundant subtype of the GABA(A) receptor and is localized in many regions of the brain. To gain more insight into the role of this receptor subtype in the modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission, we generated mice lacking either the alpha1 or beta2 subunit. In agreement with the reported abundance of this subtype, >50% of total GABA(A) receptors are lost in both alpha1-/- and beta2-/- mice. Surprisingly, homozygotes of both mouse lines are viable, fertile, and show no spontaneous seizures. Initially half of the alpha1-/- mice died prenatally or perinatally, but they exhibited a lower mortality rate in subsequent generations, suggesting some phenotypic drift and adaptive changes. Both adult alpha1-/- and beta2-/- mice demonstrate normal performances on the rotarod, but beta2-/- mice displayed increased locomotor activity. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum primarily express alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors, and in electrophysiological recordings from alpha1-/- mice GABA currents in these neurons are dramatically reduced, and residual currents have a benzodiazepine pharmacology characteristic of alpha2- or alpha3-containing receptors. In contrast, the cerebellar Purkinje neurons from beta2-/- mice have only a relatively small reduction of GABA currents. In beta2-/- mice expression levels of all six alpha subunits are reduced by approximately 50%, suggesting that the beta2 subunit can coassemble with alpha subunits other than just alpha1. Our data confirm that alpha1beta2gamma2 is the major GABA(A) receptor subtype in the murine brain and demonstrate that, surprisingly, the loss of this receptor subtype is not lethal.",

    "77": "The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of delirium in AIDS patients residing at a skilled nursing facility and to identify factors and outcomes associated with delirium episodes. Medical records were reviewed for 137 patients discharged from or dying at the facility in 1994. Presence or absence of delirium was determined using the Confusion Assessment Method. Patients with delirium were compared to those without delirium regarding demographics, medical conditions, and medication exposure using Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, and two-tailed t-tests. A model for delirium based on medication exposure was determined using multiple logistic regression. Forty-six percent of patients (n = 63) were determined to have at least one delirium episode; only one episode was diagnosed at the time of occurrence. Associated medical conditions included medication changes (44%), fever (38%), and infection (26%). Narcotics, benzodiazepines, anticholinergic/antihistaminic, and steroid medications each contributed significantly to the model for delirium (chi 2 = 60.19; df = 4; p = 0.0000). The authors concluded that delirium is a common yet underidentified condition in AIDS patients, and that patterns of medication use contribute to a large number of delirium episodes.",

    "80": "The authors evaluated an integrated approach for the screening of drugs in biosamples consisting of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of serum or whole blood (SB/GC-MS) and of high-performance liquid chromatographic and ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) analysis of urine with the REMEDi HS Biorad system (U/REM) (Bio-rad; Segrate, MI, Italy). Urine and blood samples from 26 suspected intoxicated patients and from 22 suspected lethal poisoning cases were examined. Eighty-one of the 99 parent drugs/main metabolites detected were identified by SB/GC-MS and 54 with U/REM. Thirty-six drugs/metabolites were identified with both methods, 45 by SB/GC-MS alone, and 18 by U/REM alone. Absence of the mass spectrometry (MS) spectra in the reference library and high polarity of the analytes were the main reasons for failed identification by SB/GC-MS. Unsuccessful identifications with U/REM were basically caused by the absence of the UV spectra in the reference library or by low chromatographic and spectroscopic selectivity as in the case of barbiturates and benzodiazepines (BZD), which represented 11% and 51%, respectively, of the 45 SB/GC-MS unique identifications. Urine samples of 14 BZD-positive cases were also submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis and analyzed with the REMEDi UBz assay, and results were compared with those obtained by SB/GC-MS: 14 of the 22 identified BZD were detected with both methods, three by U/REM only, and five by SB/GC-MS only. In conclusion, the integrated use of SB/GC-MS and U/REM approaches greatly enhances the amount and quality of analytical information obtainable by applying either method alone.", 
    "81": "The expression of mRNAs for the GABAA receptor subunits alpha1, alpha6, beta2, beta3, gamma2 and delta in single mouse cerebellar granule cells and cortical interneurons were analysed by RT-PCR and correlated to their midazolam and zinc modulation of agonist-induced receptor currents. The registration of molecular and electrophysiological data from each cell allowed us to estimate the significance of individual subunits and their two-factor interaction for modulation. The presence of alpha6 decreased midazolam modulation, but statistical analysis also suggested interactions of alpha6 with beta3 and gamma2 with respect to midazolam modulation. Zinc modulation was decreased by the presence of gamma2, and analysis points to an beta3 effect as well as an interaction between gamma2 and delta in zinc modulation. Thus, our model confirmed, in single native cells, the known effects of alpha6 in midazolam and gamma2 in zinc modulation, and additionally pointed to significant subunit interactions that need to be further tested in recombinant receptors. The present study offers a method to identify subunit interactions in heteromeric receptor complexes.", 
    "82": "To study Ca(2+) fluxes between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we used \"cameleon\" indicators targeted to the cytosol, the ER lumen, and the mitochondrial matrix. High affinity mitochondrial probes saturated in approximately 20% of mitochondria during histamine stimulation of HeLa cells, whereas a low affinity probe reported averaged peak values of 106 +/- 5 microm, indicating that Ca(2+) transients reach high levels in a fraction of mitochondria. In concurrent ER measurements, [Ca(2+)](ER) averaged 371 +/- 21 microm at rest and decreased to 133 +/- 14 microm and 59 +/- 5 microm upon stimulation with histamine and thapsigargin, respectively, indicating that substantial ER refilling occur during agonist stimulation. A larger ER depletion was observed when mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was prevented by oligomycin and rotenone or when Ca(2+) efflux from mitochondria was blocked by CGP 37157, indicating that some of the Ca(2+) taken up by mitochondria is re-used for ER refilling. Accordingly, ER regions close to mitochondria released less Ca(2+) than ER regions lacking mitochondria. The ER heterogeneity was abolished by thapsigargin, oligomycin/rotenone, or CGP 37157, indicating that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake locally modulate ER refilling. These observations indicate that some mitochondria are very close to the sites of Ca(2+) release and recycle a substantial portion of the captured Ca(2+) back to vicinal ER domains. The distance between the two organelles thus determines both the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca(2+) signals and the filling state of neighboring ER regions.", 
    "83": "Day-old chicks of both sexes were individually categorised on the latency to peck pebbles and termed as high latency (HL), moderate latency (ML) or low latency (LL). Anxiolytic doses of diazepam diminished the latency only in the HL category, suggesting that it is the most anxious category. At 15 days of age, the LL category showed the lowest latency to ambulate in the open-field test, the lowest immobility duration in the tonic immobility test and insensitivity to anxiolytic doses of diazepam in both behavioural tests suggesting that it is the less anxious category. The increase of the central benzodiazepine receptor density induced by acute stressors was the highest in the most anxious and/or fearful HL category. There were more females than males in the LL category and inversely in the HL category there were more males. The results suggest that the fear pattern depends on the sex and inter-individual differences within a same sex which are stable across life. This could be used as a test for fear and/or anxiety state, and useful to choose fowls with the best performance later in life.", 
    "84": "4-[[3-(1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-9-purin-9-yl)-1-oxopropyl]amino]benzoic acid (AIT-082) is an hypoxanthine derivative that stimulates in vitro neurite outgrowth and the production of adenosine and neurotrophins from astrocytes. These effects may predict an in vivo neuroprotective activity of the drug. Thus, we evaluated whether AIT-082 protected against a long-term excitotoxicity of hippocampal neurons following status epilepticus induced in rats by i.p. injection of kainate (12 mg/kg). The epileptogenic effect of kainate was evaluated by monitoring behavioral signs and by electroencephalographic (EEG) recording (80% of the animals showed status epilepticus with a latency of 96.8 +/- 7.4 min starting from the injection). In surviving rats (40% of the injected animals) the neurotoxic effect was evaluated by measuring glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity, as an index of loss of hippocampal GABAergic neurons, by evaluating the body weight after 7 days and by histological examination of hippocampi. The GAD activity was reduced by 44 +/- 8%, and neuronal loss (about 70%) was found in the CA3c, the CA1 area, and in the dentate gyrus. A single dose of diazepam (20 mg/kg; i.p., 20 min before the kainate injection) almost completely inhibited both seizures and neurotoxicity, ensuring survival of animals. AIT-082 (60 mg/kg/day; i.p., for 7 days, starting from 20 min before the kainate injection) did not modify the seizures caused by kainate but, like diazepam, it decreased kainate-induced mortality, the reduction of GAD activity, and the loss of hippocampal neurons. These data confirm that AIT-082 is of potential interest for the experimental therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "89": "During brain development in nonhuman primates, there are large changes in GABAA receptor binding and subunit expression. An understanding of human GABAA receptor ontogeny is highly relevant in elucidating the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders in which GABAergic mechanisms play a role as well as in understanding differences that occur during development in the pharmacology of drugs acting on this system. We have measured age-related changes in the brain distribution of the GABAA receptor complex in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) in epileptic children under evaluation for surgical treatment. PET imaging was performed using the tracer [11C]flumazenil (FMZ), a ligand that binds to alpha subunits of the GABAA receptor. FMZ binding was quantified using a two-compartment model yielding values for the volume of distribution (VD) of the tracer in tissue. All brain regions studied showed the highest value for FMZ VD at the youngest age measured (2 years), and the values then decreased exponentially with age. Medial temporal lobe structures, primary visual cortex, and thalamus showed larger differences between values for age 2 years and adults (approximately 50% decrease) than did basal ganglia, cerebellum, and other cortical regions (25-40% decreases). Furthermore, subcortical regions reached adult values earlier (14-17.5 years) than did cortical regions (18-22 years). The ontogeny data of FMZ VD from children may contribute to understanding regional differences in synaptic plasticity as well as improve rational therapeutic use of drugs acting at the GABAA receptor in the pediatric population.", 
    "90": "In the present report, the action of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on testicular steroid hormone formation was studied. For this purpose, the direct effects of LIF were evaluated on basal and human (h)CG-stimulated testosterone synthesis by cultured, purified Leydig cells isolated from porcine testes. LIF reduced (more than 60%) hCG-stimulated testosterone synthesis. This inhibitory effect was exerted in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The maximal and half-maximal effects were obtained with, respectively, 10 ng/ml (0.5 nM ) and 2.5 ng/ml (0.125 nM ) of LIF after a 48-h treatment of the Leydig cells. Such an effect of the cytokine was not a cytotoxic effect, because it was reversible and Leydig cells recovered most of their steroidogenic activity after the removal of LIF. Considering the sites of action of LIF in inhibiting gonadotropin-stimulated testosterone formation, it was shown that LIF significantly (P < 0.002) reduced, in a comparable range (about 60% decrease), testosterone synthesis stimulated with LH/hCG or with pharmacological agents that enhance cAMP levels (cholera toxin, forskolin, and PG E2), and testosterone synthesis stimulated with 8-bromo-cAMP. Such an observation indicates that the antigonadotropic action of the cytokine is exerted in a predominant manner at a step (or steps) located beyond cAMP formation. Furthermore, incubation of Leydig cells with 22R-hydroxycholesterol (5 microg/ml, 2 h), a cholesterol substrate derivative that does not need an assisted process to be delivered to the inner mitochondrial membrane, reversed most of the inhibitory effect of LIF on the steroid hormone formation. Such results indicate that LIF acts by reducing cholesterol substrate availability in the mitochondria. Consequently, LIF action was tested on steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and PBR (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) shown to be potentially involved in such a cholesterol transfer. LIF reduced, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, LH/hCG-induced steroidogenic acute regulatory protein messenger RNA levels. The maximal inhibitory effect was obtained with 6.6 ng/ml of LIF after 48 h of treatment. In contrast, LIF had no effect on PBR messenger RNA expression or PBR binding. This inhibitory effect of LIF on Leydig cell steroidogenesis is probably exerted via an auto/paracrine action of the cytokine. Indeed, by immunohistochemistry, LIF and LIF receptor proteins were identified in Leydig and Sertoli cells but not in other testicular cell types, except for LIF receptor in spermatogonia. Furthermore, the presence of LIF and its receptor in Leydig cells at the neonatal and adult periods suggests that the inhibitory effect of LIF on androgen formation reported here probably occurs in both the fetal and the adult Leydig cell populations during testicular development.", 
    "91": "Weight gain frequently accompanies treatment with antipsychotics. In order to determine whether newer antipsychotic agents differ from each other with respect to weight gain, we compared two cohorts of patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who had newly started treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine. After obtaining informed consent, data regarding body weight and height were culled from existing medical records of 100 patients (50 patients in each treatment group). Baseline body weight, close to the time of starting the new medication, and body mass index [BMI = weight (kg)/height (m) squared] were compared to the body weight and BMI following 4 months of treatment. There was no significant change in mean body weight or BMI in the group treated with risperidone (baseline weight = 83.1 kg +/- 20.5, follow-up = 82.8 kg +/- 19.9; matched pair t = 0.66, P = n.s.; baseline BMI = 29.6 +/- 9.4, follow-up = 29.5 +/- 9.1; matched pair t = 0.79, P = n.s.).

    "92": "Tryptophan substitutions were made in the second transmembrane domain of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABAA) receptor alpha and beta subunits and the resulting mutant receptors, containing alpha2(S270W) and/or beta1 (S265W), were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation of either or both subunits resulted in receptors that exhibited enhanced sensitivity to agonist and were spontaneously active in the absence of GABA. The spontaneous activity was blocked by picrotoxin or bicuculline. The enhancement of GABA-induced currents by pentobarbital, by the neurosteroid 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one, and by the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam was dramatically reduced in the mutant receptors. These results are consistent with the idea that a mutation that promotes gating behavior in a ligand-gated ion channel will also show reduced effects of all positive allosteric modulators in a generalized manner, even when these modulators act at distinct sites on the receptor.",

    "98": "Resistance to apoptosis is a major obstacle preventing effective therapy for malignancy. Mitochondria localized anti-death proteins of the Bcl-2 family play a central role in inhibiting apoptosis and therefore present valid targets for novel therapy. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) shares a close physical association with the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), a pivotal regulator of cell death located at mitochondrial contact sites. In this study we investigated the cytotoxicity of the PBR ligand, PK11195, in the micromolar concentration range. PK11195 induced antioxidant inhibitable collapse of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and mitochondrial swelling in HL60 human leukaemia cells, but not in SUDHL4 lymphoma cells (which exhibited a higher level of reduced glutathione and relative tolerance to chemotherapy or pro-oxidant induced DeltaPsi(m)dissipation). PK11195 induced the production of hydrogen peroxide that was not inhibited by Bcl-2 transfection, nor depletion of mitochondrial DNA. ROS production was however blocked by protonophore, implicating a requirement for DeltaPsi(m). Our findings suggest that PK11195-induced cytotoxicity relies upon Bcl-2 resistant generation of oxidative stress; a process only observed at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher that required to saturate its receptor.",

The aims of this study were 1) to monitor a selection of subjective, physiological and performance variables in elite athletes and sedentary subjects following a westerly flight across five time zones, and 2) to examine whether the promotion of sleep by means of a low-dose benzodiazepine drug influences these responses to transmeridian travel. Subjects comprised eight members of the British men's gymnastics squad, aged 18-30 years, and nine members of the British Olympic Association's support staff, aged 24- 55 years (4 females, 5 males). Subjects were pair-matched for age, sex and athleticism (apart from one person) and assigned to either the treatment (n = 9) or placebo (n = 8) group. All subjects travelled from U.K., arriving at Tallahassee, Florida, at approximately 22:00 hours local time. A test battery was administered to the subjects at 07:00, 12:00, 17:00 and 21:00 hours on the first full day of arrival (this was designated day one) and then on alternate days (day 3, day 5 and day 7). Immediately before retiring to bed on days 1, 2 and 3, subjects were administered, in a double-blind fashion, either 10mg of temazepam or a placebo. Measures in the test battery included sleep quality, sleep length, subjective jet lag (one-to-ten simple analogue scale), tympanic temperature, one-, two-, four- and eight-choice reaction time, grip strength (left and right), leg strength and back strength. Over the 24 h of each test day, subjects also recorded the volume of each urine voided. Data were analysed with a repeated measures general linear model. Alpha was set at 0.01 to control for type I errors with multiple dependent variables. Mean subjective jet lag reduced from 4.6 units to baseline, and mean sleep quality improved by 2.0 units from day 1 to day 5 (P<0.001), after which no further alterations were noted. Subjective jet lag, left and right grip strength and choice reaction time all showed post-flight day x time of day interactions (P < 0.01). On day 1, these variables deteriorated as the day progressed to the worst recorded values. On days 3, 5 and 7, diurnal variations with the conventional high in the early evening and morning-to-evening differences of about 10% were evident. There was a trend for the reduction in subjective jet lag over the post-flight days to be more rapid following ingestion of a low dose of temazepam (P= 0.037). We cannot rule out the possibility that this could be a type I error, since none of the treatment by day interactions reached the alpha level of significance (set at 0.01). The morning-to-evening variations of body temperature and grip strength were greater in the young athletes than in the older sedentary support staff (P < 0.01). Sleep quality was greater in the athletic subjects after the first full day in Tallahassee. These results suggest that the nightly administration of a low dose (10 mg) of temazepam has little influence on the recovery of subjective, physiological and performance measures following a westward flight across five time zones. In both the treatment and control groups, subjective jet lag and performance were worst in the evening of the first full day after arrival, and the young athletes slept better than the older support staff that same night. This illustrates the importance of monitoring jet lag symptoms and performance variables at different times of day following a flight to a new time zone.",

In vitro agonist activity on isolated guinea pig gallbladder along with in vivo induction of satiety following intraperitoneal administration in a rat feeding assay was demonstrated.", 
    "101": "GABA(A) receptors are heteropentamers that are heterogeneously distributed at different synapses in the central nervous system. Although the modulation of GABA(A) receptors received much attention in hippocampal pyramidal cells, information is scarce regarding the pharmacology of these receptors in inhibitory interneurons. We investigated the pharmacological properties of GABA(A)-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) using whole-cell voltage clamp recordings in two morphologically identified types of hippocampal CA1 interneurons, horizontal and vertical cells of stratum oriens-alveus. The negative modulators zinc (200 microM) and furosemide (600 microM) significantly decreased the amplitude of mIPSCs. Benzodiazepine agonists also produced significant effects: 10 microM zolpidem increased the amplitude, rise time, and decay time constant (decay tau) of mIPSCs, whereas 10 microM flunitrazepam affected similarly the amplitude and decay tau, but not the rise time. The neurosteroid allopregnanolone (10 microM) prolonged the decay tau of mIPSCs. Since these modulators act on different GABA(A) receptor subunits, this pharmacological profile suggests that GABA(A) receptors at spontaneously active inhibitory synapses onto vertical and horizontal interneurons are heterogeneous and formed by co-assembly of different combinations of subunits (alpha(1-5)beta(1-3)gamma(1-3)). Furthermore, these synaptic GABA(A) receptors appear in large part pharmacologically similar to those of pyramidal cells.", 
    "102": "Ligands acting at the benzodiazepine (BZ) site of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors currently are the most widely used hypnotics. BZs such as diazepam (Dz) potentiate GABA(A) receptor activation. To determine the GABA(A) receptor subtypes that mediate the hypnotic action of Dz wild-type mice and mice that harbor Dz-insensitive alpha1 GABA(A) receptors [alpha1 (H101R) mice] were compared. Sleep latency and the amount of sleep after Dz treatment were not affected by the point mutation. An initial reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep also occurred equally in both genotypes. Furthermore, the Dz-induced changes in the sleep and waking electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra, the increase in power density above 21 Hz in non-REM sleep and waking, and the suppression of slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG power in the 0.75- to 4.0-Hz band) in non-REM sleep were present in both genotypes. Surprisingly, these effects were even more pronounced in alpha1(H101R) mice and sleep continuity was enhanced by Dz only in the mutants. Interestingly, Dz did not affect the initial surge of SWA at the transitions to sleep, indicating that the SWA-generating mechanisms are not impaired by the BZ. We conclude that the REM sleep inhibiting action of Dz and its effect on the EEG spectra in sleep and waking are mediated by GABA(A) receptors other than alpha1, i.e., alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 GABA(A) receptors. Because alpha1 GABA(A) receptors mediate the sedative action of Dz, our results provide evidence that the hypnotic effect of Dz and its EEG \"fingerprint\" can be dissociated from its sedative action.", 
    "103": "We have recently identified a novel class of allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors, the ROD compounds that are structurally related to bicuculline. Here, the relationship of their site of action relative to other known modulatory sites of this receptor was investigated. Two types of ROD compounds, R1 (ROD164A, ROD185) and R2 (ROD222 and ROD259) could be differentiated. R1 compounds competitively inhibited binding of benzodiazepines in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors, and their functional effects were partially inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 in a noncompetitive manner. The enhancement by an R1 compound was not additive with that by diazepam. R2 compounds in contrast failed to inhibit binding of benzodiazepines; the R2 compounds' functional effects were not inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist. The enhancement by an R2 compound was additive with that by diazepam. In contrast to benzodiazepines, both R1 and R2 type compounds were still able to enhance alpha1beta2 receptors. ROD164A in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors was found to be partially antagonized by Ro15-1788 in a noncompetitive way. ROD178B did not affect gamma-aminobutyric acid induced currents, but was able to inhibit both enhancement by R1 and R2 type compounds as well as enhancement by diazepam. R1 and R2 type compounds as well as diazepam enhanced pentobarbital-induced currents in a Ro15-1788-sensitive way. We conclude that R1 type compounds act at the benzodiazepine binding site and additionally at a different R1 site, and that the R1, but not the R2 site is allosterically coupled to the benzodiazepine binding site. ROD178B is a competitive antagonist at the R1 site in that it shows allosteric interaction with the benzodiazepine binding site and displacement of benzodiazepines, and a negative allosteric modulator at the R2 site.", 
    "104": "Motor practice may lead to expansion of trained representations in the motor cortex, but it is unknown whether this practice-dependent plasticity can be purposefully enhanced or depressed. Evidence, mainly based on animal experiments, indicates that the activity of GABA-related cortical inhibition is important in controlling the extent to which plasticity may occur. We tested the role of GABA in modulating practice-dependent plasticity in the human motor cortex. A decrease in GABA-related cortical inhibition was achieved by ischaemic nerve block (INB) in the hand by deafferentation/deefferentation and an increase was achieved by administration of the GABA(A) receptor agonist lorazepam. In Experiment 1, healthy subjects performed motor practice (MP), consisting of repeated ballistic contractions of the biceps muscle in the absence (MP alone) or presence of INB (MP+INB). Changes in the biceps motor cortex representation were assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). MP+INB resulted in a dramatic increase in the size of the motor evoked potential (MEP) and in paired-pulse excitability compared with mild or no changes in the MP-alone and INB-alone conditions. In Experiment 2, this dramatic increase in biceps representation induced by MP+INB was replicated when subjects were pretreated with placebo, but this increase was prevented or even switched to a decrease when subjects were pretreated with lorazepam. These findings indicate that a decrease in GABA-related inhibition facilitates practice-dependent plasticity in the human motor cortex, whereas an increase depresses it. In Experiment 3, practice-dependent plasticity (assessed by TMS, as in the first two experiments) was also tested at the behavioural level. The dramatic increase in biceps MEP size induced by MP+INB was paralleled by an increase in peak acceleration of the fastest elbow flexion movements. Similarly, the lack of change in MEP size in the MP-alone condition was paralleled by a lack of change in peak acceleration. We propose that changes in GABA activity may be instrumented to modulate plasticity purposefully; for instance, to enhance plastic change and recovery of function after a lesion in neurological patients.", 
    "105": "The decrease in brain CO(2) partial pressure (pCO(2)) that takes place both during voluntary and during pathological hyperventilation is known to induce gross alterations in cortical functions that lead to subjective sensations and altered states of consciousness. The mechanisms that mediate the effects of the decrease in pCO(2) at the neuronal network level are largely unexplored. In the present work, the modulation of gamma oscillations by hypocapnia was studied in rat hippocampal slices. Field potential oscillations were induced by the cholinergic agonist carbachol under an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor blockade and were recorded in the dendritic layer of the CA3 region with parallel measurements of changes in interstitial and intraneuronal pH (pH(o) and pH(i), respectively). Hypocapnia from 5 to 1% CO(2) led to a stable monophasic increase of 0.5 and 0.2 units in pH(o) and pH(i), respectively. The mean oscillation frequency increased slightly but significantly from 32 to 34 Hz and the mean gamma-band amplitude (20 to 80 Hz) decreased by 20%. Hypocapnia induced a dramatic enhancement of the temporal stability of the oscillations, as was indicated by a two-fold increase in the exponential decay time constant fitted to the autocorrelogram. A rise in pH(i) evoked by the weak base trimethylamine (TriMA) was associated with a slight increase in oscillation frequency (37 to 39 Hz) and a decrease in amplitude (30%). Temporal stability, on the other hand, was decreased by TriMA, which suggests that its enhancement in 1% CO(2) was related to the rise in pH(o). In 1% CO(2), the decay-time constant of the evoked monosynaptic pyramidal inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) was unaltered but its amplitude was enhanced. This increase in IPSC amplitude seems to significantly contribute to the enhancement of temporal stability because the enhancement was almost fully reversed by a low concentration of bicuculline. These results suggest that changes in brain pCO(2) can have a strong influence on the temporal modulation of gamma rhythms.", 
    "106": "GABA concentration jump experiments performed on membrane patches predict that postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors will become desensitized following the release of the contents of a single GABA-containing synaptic vesicle. To examine this we used a single synaptic bouton stimulation technique to directly examine whether postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in cultured cerebellar granule cells exhibit transmitter-induced desensitization. In a large number of recordings, no evidence was found for desensitization of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors by vesicularly released transmitter. This was the case even when as many as 40 vesicles were released from a single bouton within 1.5 s. In addition, postsynaptic depolarization and application of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam, manipulations previously shown to enhance desensitization of GABA(A) receptors, failed to unmask transmitter-induced desensitization. In contrast, a single 2- to 3-s application of a high concentration of exogenous GABA was able to depress synaptic responsiveness for up to 70 s. Furthermore, pharmacological depletion of GABA eliminated inhibitory synaptic communication, suggesting that GABA is the transmitter and the desensitization-resistant inhibitory postsynaptic currents are not mediated by a \"nondesensitizing\" ligand such as beta-alanine. Overall our data indicate that a specific desensitization-resistant population of GABA(A) receptors are present at postsynaptic sites on cultured cerebellar granule cells.", 
    "107": "Determination of residual flow within the ischemic brain may be important in patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. Conventional cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification often cannot be achieved in these cases because arterial blood sampling required for the input function is prohibited. Quantitative CBF was measured in 20 patients with ischemic stroke using [(15)O]water and [(11)C]flumazenil PET with arterial blood sampling and compared with normalized nonquantified data of the same patients. For both comparisons, percentiles were derived, allowing the determination of a normalized blood flow level corresponding to an absolute CBF value below which 95% of all pixels are located. These normograms can be used to derive absolute CBF levels in milliliters per 100 g per minute from normalized data without the need for measuring an arterial input function.", 
    "108": "Several cryopreservation methods for precision-cut rat liver slices (PCLS) have been proposed, allowing a short-term (a few hours) maintainance of viability and functionality upon thawing. The aim of the present study was to test the metabolic capacity of PCLS cryopreserved by an ultrarapid method. The biotransformation of paracetamol to its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and of midazolam to its hydroxylated metabolites was studied in thawed PCLS incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C in Williams' medium E. In addition, protein levels of the key enzymes involved in these metabolic reactions, i.e. UGT1A1, ST1A1, CYP2E1 and CYP3A2 were determinated. In addition, biological markers of cell function (ATP and glycogen levels) and toxicity (LDH leakage in the medium) were also measured. Compared to controls (non cryopreserved PCLS), CYP3A2 activity and content and CYP2E1 content were maintained at the same level all along the incubation, whereas paracetamol glucuronidation and sulfation dropped to 24 and 21% of the control value, respectively, immediately after thawing. Freezing-thawing conditions also modified cell functionality, leading to a lower intracellular ATP and glycogen content, and an increase in cell lysis, as shown by LDH released in the medium. The results of this study suggest that cryopreserved PCLS are able to maintain some phase I activities for 24 hours after thawing whereas some phase II metabolic capacities are not maintained.", 
    "109": "In humans, administration of benzodiazepines (BZD) has been shown to have an asymmetrical effect on the medial olivocochlear system. Indeed, a decrease of evoked otoacoustic emission suppression by contralateral acoustic stimulation, which explores the medial olivocochlear efferent system, was observed in the right ear, with no left ear effect. This result suggests a possible left-right auditory pathway BZD receptor asymmetry. Given the anatomical link between auditory centers and the medial olivocochlear system, the existence of a larger volume of cortical connecting fibers in the left hemisphere, and the possible link between BZD receptor density and neuronal density, we tested the hypothesis of an asymmetrical localization of BZD receptors in the auditory system in 10 right-handed subjects using [11C]flumazenil positron emission tomography. Semi-quantitative measurements of flumazenil binding were evaluated in Heschl's gyrus showing a left-right asymmetry in favor of left auditory cortex. This result indicates a higher density of neurons in left auditory cortex. The possible link between neurochemical asymmetry and functional asymmetry, and the perceptual outcome of BZD administration, will be discussed.", 
    "110": "Sedation is an important aspect of care for critically ill newborns. Proper sedation reduces stress during procedures such as mechanical ventilation. Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, is widely administered as a sedative in newborn intensive care units but is not without side effects. Three term newborns developed myoclonic-like abnormal movements after receiving midazolam. In one, flumazenil controlled the abnormal movements. Flumazenil is a potent benzodiazepine antagonist that competitively blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines. It can reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines occurring after diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or after benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil may be considered in cases of abnormal movements associated with midazolam. However, further studies are needed to provide guidelines for the administration of this drug in newborns.",

    "112": "GAD is common, often follows a chronic course, and usually is associated with extensive psychiatric and medical comorbidity. This disorder often presents in a primary care setting, commonly with somatic symptoms; it is important for primary care physicians to be aware of its existence, forms of presentation, and different treatments. GAD appears to be twice as common in women than men. There is some evidence that the neurobiologic basis of GAD may involve abnormalities in neurochemical, neuroendocrine, neurophysiologic, and neuroanatomic factors. Research on psychosocial treatment of GAD has favored the combination of cognitive therapy and relaxation techniques or anxiety management training. It also appears that relapse rates after termination of cognitive-behavioral therapy are low. Taking into consideration that GAD generally is chronic and associated frequently with depressive symptoms, the ideal pharmacotherapy may be a drug that can treat these comorbid disorders adequately. New antidepressants, especially those with action in the serotonin system and possibly noradrenergic, may be the appropriate option: They not only treat anxiety, but also treat or prevent the development of comorbid depression; they should be effective ideally during prolonged periods without risks related to addiction or withdrawal, such as may happen with benzodiazepines and some antidepressants. The role of newly emerging drugs, such as some anticonvulsants, in GAD needs to be defined more clearly. More research is warranted to address issues such as (1) whether pharmacotherapy is as effective, less effective, or more effective than cognitive-behavioral therapy; (2) whether antidepressants improve the rate of wellness or remission; and (3) whether prolonged antidepressant therapy for GAD protects against later emergent depression.",

Diazepam reduced the pineal melatonin content (by a factor of 2) and the activity of N-acetyltransferase (NAT) (by a factor of 3.5), as well as plasma melatonin levels (by a factor of 1.5), but had no effects on pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity. By contrast to the pineal gland, diazepam failed to affect the Harderian gland melatonin content.", 
    "117": "Our results suggest that the inhibition of melatonin production induced by diazepam in vivo may be due to a direct action of this benzodiazepine on the pineal gland, through its action on NAT, the key enzyme of melatonin synthesis, and that the control of melatonin production in the Harderian glands may be different from that observed in the pineal gland.",

In the OF the behaviour of both strains was consistent with previous results showing that reactive rats had significantly higher levels of defecation and lower levels of activity than the non-reactive rats. However, there were no significant strain differences in CA responses or in the time spent on the open arms of the EPM. In addition, the full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide, induced quantitatively similar effects in both strains of rats. In the FPS test, MNRA/Hars had a higher baseline level of startle and fear potentiation than the MR/Har rats.",

GABA-evoked currents had an EC(50) of 180+/-30 microM. Responses were blocked by the competitive and non-competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonists, bicuculline methochloride and picrotoxin. Sodium pentobarbital reversibly potentiated the current several-fold, and Zn(2+) ions blocked the current with high potency (IC50=20 microM). GABA-evoked currents were potentiated by the benzodiazepine site full agonists flunitrazepam and triazolam and less by the partial agonists abecarnil and bretazenil. The inverse agonists methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) reduced the current.

Vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) in rats have been widely accepted as an animal model of tardive dyskinesia. In the present study isoniazid (1, 2 and 5 microM i.c.v.) dose-dependently produced VCMs in rats. The response produced by a 10-microM dose was lower than that of earlier doses but was statistically significant when compared to a saline-treated group. Diazepam (1 and 4 mg/kg i.p.) and progabide (50 and 100 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently reversed the isoniazid-induced VCMs. Haloperidol (0.5 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) and SCH-23390 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) reversed the isoniazid-induced VCMs in a dose-dependent manner. Sulpiride (25 and 50 mg/kg i.p.), a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, had no effect on isoniazid-induced VCMs. SKF-38393 (10 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently augmented the isoniazid-induced VCMs. Quinpirole 0.02 mg/kg i.p. had no effect on isoniazid-induced VCMs but a higher quinpirole dose (0.05 mg/kg) significantly reduced isoniazid-induced VCMs. Isoniazid (2 microM i.c.v.) produced stereotypy (grooming and rearing) in rats. Haloperidol (0.5 and 1 mg/kg i.p.), SCH-23390 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and sulpiride (25 and 50 mg/kg i.p.) decreased the severity of isoniazid-induced stereotypy. SKF-38393 (10 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently augmented the isoniazid-induced grooming behavior more prominently as compared to quinpirole (0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg i.p.); on the other hand quinpirole potentiated isoniazid-induced rearing behavior.

Status epilepticus was induced by transauricular electrical stimulation with a stimulus of 15 mA at 0.5, 3, 10, 20 and 30 min, starting half an hour after intraperitoneal administration of vehicle/drug. The median effective doses of diazepam and phenytoin alone and in combination with a fixed dose of nimodipine (24 mg/kg) was calculated. The ED50s of diazepam and phenytoin were found to be 10.5 and 9 mg/kg, respectively. When nimodipine was combined with diazepam or phenytoin, the ED50 values decreased to 3.77 mg/kg and 7.15 mg/kg, respectively. The severity of seizures was also decreased by combination with nimodipine as compared to diazepam and phenytoin given alone. To study the effect of nimodipine on psychomotor impairments produced by diazepam and phenytoin three tests were performed: rotarod, behavioral despair and hole board. Nimodipine did not show protective effects on its own but potentiated the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and phenytoin.

    "132": "Using the latency for tail-flick after thermal stimulation we have assessed the effects of alpha-, gamma(1)- and gamma(2)-MSH on nociceptive threshold in the mice. Intracisternal injections of gamma(2)-MSH induced a distinct analgesia, while gamma(1)-MSH in the same doses gave only a minor analgesia. Intracisternal alpha-MSH instead gave a short-term hyperalgesia. The effect of gamma(2)-MSH was not blocked by any of the MC(4)/MC(3)receptor antagonist HS014, naloxone or by the prior intracisternal administrations of gamma(1)-MSH. However, the gamma(2)-MSH analgesic response was completely attenuated by treating animals with the GABA(A)antagonist bicuculline. The gamma(2)-MSH analgesic effect was moreover additive to the analgesia afforded by muscimol and ethanol, but not to that afforded by diazepam. In addition both gamma(1)- and gamma(2)-MSH induced moderate catalepsy, but could at the same time attenuate haloperidol induced catalepsia. We conclude that gamma(2)-MSH mediates a central analgesic effect via GABA-receptor dependent pathway that is distinct from melanocortic- and opioid-receptors. Moreover, the mechanism for gamma(2)-MSH's analgesic effect appears to be distinct from that causing moderate catalepsia by gamma-MSH's.", 
    "133": "In general, antipsychotic agents have diverse actions on a wide range of neurotransmitter systems. Data strongly suggest that a number of these systems may play a role in the regulation of body weight. In addition to having very distinct pharmacologic profiles, individual agents possess discrete weight gain liabilities. This article briefly reviews the evidence for the involvement of specific neurotransmitter systems in the control of body weight and describes the relevant pharmacologic characteristics of individual antipsychotic agents. By comparing the pharmacologic profiles of specific antipsychotic agents with their respective weight gain liabilities, this article attempts to gain an insight into the specific receptors underlying a drug's propensity to induce weight gain. However, there is still much to be learned concerning weight control mechanisms, and the role of many of the receptors at which antipsychotic agents are active remains unclear. In spite of this, an overview of current knowledge in the field may facilitate prediction of a potential novel antipsychotic agent's weight gain liability.",

SE is a major clinical concern in the elderly population, both because it has increased incidence in the elderly compared with the general population, and because of concurrent medical conditions that are more likely to complicate therapy and worsen prognosis in elderly individuals. The incidence of SE in the elderly is almost twice that of the general population at 86 per 100,000 per year. With the anticipated growth of the elderly population, SE is likely to become an increasingly common problem facing clinicians, and an important public health issue. The elderly have the highest SE-associated mortality of any age group at 38%, and the very old elderly (>80 years of age) have a mortality of at least 50%. Acute or remote stroke is the most common aetiology of SE in the elderly. Nonconvulsive SE (NCSE) has a wide range of clinical presentations, ranging from confusion to obtundation. It occurs commonly in elderly patients who are critically ill and in the setting of coma. Electroencephalogram is the only reliable method of diagnosing NCSE. The goal of treatment for SE is rapid cessation of clinical and electrical seizure activity. Most treatment protocols call for the immediate administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine, followed by phenytoin or fosphenytoin. Recent studies suggest that when this initial treatment of SE fails, little is gained by using additional standard drugs. General anaesthetic agents (such as pentobarbital, midazolam, or propofol) should be expeditiously employed, although these treatments have their own potential complications. Intravenous valproic acid is a recent addition to the armamentarium of drugs for the treatment of SE, with a low risk of hypotension, respiratory depression and hypotension, making it a potentially useful drug for the treatment of SE in the elderly. However, further information is needed to establish its role in the overall treatment of SE.",

    "138": "Our reports of new-onset diabetes due to olanzapine are consistent with those in the literature. Although the mechanism is not yet known, it has been hypothesized that perhaps damage to the pancreatic islet cells, weight gain, dysregulation of the sympathetic system, and insulin resistance are contributing factors.", 
    "139": "Diabetes mellitus secondary to olanzapine use seems to be a rare occurrence. However, certain risk factors such as obesity, family history, and concomitant medications may predispose an individual to development of diabetes mellitus while taking olanzapine. An increased awareness of this reaction is essential in the treatment of patients at risk. Periodic serum glucose monitoring in these individuals may be warranted.", 
    "140": "The inhibition potential of drugs towards five major human hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes (CYP2A6, 3A4, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1) was investigated via cassette dosing of the five probe substrates (coumarin, midazolam, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and chlorzoxazone) in human liver microsomes using a 96-well plate format. After microsomal incubations had been terminated with formic acid, the five marker metabolites (7-hydroxycoumarin, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, 4-hydroxytolbutamide, dextrorphan, and 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone) were simultaneously quantified using direct injection/online guard cartridge extraction/tandem mass spectrometry (DI-GCE/MS/MS). Several advantages resulted from the use of a short C(18) guard cartridge (4 mm in length) for DI-GCE/MS/MS, including minimal sample preparation, fast online extraction, short analysis time (2.5 min), and minimal source contamination. In addition, this method demonstrated an inter-day accuracy range from -8.7 - 7.4% with a precision less than 8.3% for the quantification of all the marker metabolites. The inhibition assay for the five CYP isozymes was evaluated using their known selective inhibitors via individual and cassette dosing of the probe substrates. The IC(50) values measured via cassette dosing were consistent with those observed via individual dosing, which were all in agreement with the reported values. In addition, the validated assay was used to evaluate the inhibitory potential of 23 generic drugs (randomly selected) towards the five CYP isozymes. The results suggest the integration of the cassette dosing strategy and the DI-GCE/MS/MS method can provide a reliable in vitro approach to screening the inhibitory potential of new chemical entities, with maximal throughput and cost-effectiveness, in support of drug discovery and development.", 
    "141": "In literature, cases of nutmeg abuse have been described repeatedly, but only one fatal case of poisoning was reported [1]. In the present case, myristicin (4 microg/ml) was detected for the first time in the postmortal serum of a 55-year-old woman. Identification was achieved with the aid of UV-VIS spectroscopy and TLC; for quantification, HPLC was used. Because also flunitrazepam (0.072 microg/ml) was found, death had probably been due to the combined toxic effect of both substances. From 1996 to 1998, in a series of cases, seven poisonings with nutmeg were recorded by the Erfurt Poison Information Centre. Even where higher doses (20-80 g of powder) had been ingested, a life-threatening situation was never observed. In one of these cases, a myristicin blood level of 2 microg/ml was measured 8h after ingestion of two to three tablespoonful of nutmeg powder (approx. 14-21 g, or 280-420 mg/kg).", 
    "142": "Eight open clinical trials conducted by 7 different study groups and including 78 patients have all demonstrated that augmentation with supraphysiological doses of thyroxine (T4) has antidepressant and prophylactic effects in roughly 50% of patients completely resistant to all other antidepressant and prophylactic therapies. Beneficial effects have been observed in unipolar and bipolar (rapid-cycling and non-rapid-cycling) patients, but only when an antidepressant or prophylactic drug was administered concomitantly. Double-blind studies are now needed in order to confirm these results. It has also consistently been shown that high serum concentrations of T4 predict favourable response to antidepressant treatment and that the serum levels of T4 decrease in responders to these treatments, but not in non-responders. As thyroid hormone function in the CNS depends almost entirely on the uptake of T4 and its intracellular deiodination to the active compound T3, the hypothesis was investigated that the falls in serum levels of T4 seen during antidepressant treatment are due to enhanced conversion of T4 to T3 in the CNS. However, the results of several animal studies revealed that, while a number of different antidepressants do in fact each have specific effects on thyroid hormone metabolism in the CNS, no consistent enhancement of T3 concentrations has been demonstrated in homogenates of any relevant brain region. Recent studies measuring T3 in subcellular fractions have reported a selective increase in T3 levels in the mitochondria of the amygdala following various antidepressant treatments. The relevance of this finding must be clarified in further studies. However, in humans serum levels of T4 also decline after non-antidepressant treatments (for example, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines), and T3 concentrations in the rat brain are elevated by many other kinds of non- antidepressant treatment (e.g. stress). The function of T3 appears to be a rather general enhancement of all kinds of neuronal activity. Thus, it would seem unlikely that effects on thyroid hormone function are the decisive and specific step involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments. Rather, the function of T3 is altered as a secondary response to other primary effects of antidepressant treatments and also other psychopharmacological therapies.", 
    "143": "Midazolam, a short-lived benzodiazepine producing sedation and reversible anterograde amnesia, was administered intravenously to 14 healthy male volunteers. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with intravenous H2 15O at either a 'high' midazolam EEG effect (EEG signs of stage 2 sleep), or 'low' midazolam EEG effect (increase in EEG beta power only). Memory tests administered following PET scans showed significant drug-induced impairment in learning and retrieval at the same drug concentration at which PET images were acquired. Statistical parametric mapping was used to identify regions where rCBF changes after drug administration were significantly different in the high- vs. low- effect groups. Dosexcondition interactions were found in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's areas (BA) 9 and 46], bilateral orbital-frontal cortex (BA 47), the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 22) and the right hippocampus. The predominantly left frontal rCBF decreases occur in a region associated with semantic processing, working memory, and encoding of verbal material, a process preferentially affected by midazolam. Our interpretation is that rCBF changes in the hippocampus are unlikely to mediate the anterograde amnesia produced by midazolam. Although in the present study PET images were acquired during the resting state rather than during memory processing, these results underscore the need for further investigation relating to the interaction of midazolam with specific cognitive operations in these brain regions.", 
    "144": "GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha1beta3 gamma2 and alpha1beta3 subunits were expressed in insect Sf9 cells and solubilized in 1% Triton X100. In sucrose density gradients, [3H]-Ro15-1788 binding activity, in the case of alpha1beta3 gamma2, and [3H]-muscimol binding activity, in the case of alpha1beta3 containing receptors sedimented as a single sharp peak suggesting the formation of receptors containing a defined number of subunits. When alpha1beta3gamma2 -containing receptors were incubated with an alpha-subunit specific antibody (bd24), a single class of antibody receptor complex was formed irrespective of the receptor-antibody ratio. This is consistent with two alpha subunits cross-linked within the receptor by the antibody. Similar results were obtained using a beta-subunit specific antibody (bd17). Several classes of antibody-receptor complex were formed when receptors were pre-incubated with a gamma specific antibody (anti gamma(2) 1-15 Cys). This profile is consistent with the presence of a single gamma subunit in each complex. Experiments with alpha1beta3 subunit containing receptors and antibody bd24 produced a profile similar to that seen with alpha1beta3 gamma2 receptors, consistent with two alpha subunits per receptor complex. In this case, the anti-beta subunit antibody, bd17, produced a unique and complex profile consistent with three beta subunits per receptor. This method permits the rapid determination of subunit stoichiometries of homogeneous receptor populations", 
    "145": "The influence of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands Ro5-4864 (0.05 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or PK11195 (0.05 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on the anxiolytic effect of ethanol (1.2 g/kg; 14% p/v; i.p.) was investigated in rats tested on the elevated plus-maze. Other animals were injected through intrahippocampal administrations of the ligands (0.5 or 1.0 nmol/0.5 &mgr;l) before ethanol (1.2g/kg; 14% p/v; i.p.) and submitted to the elevated plus-maze test. The results showed that the systemic administration of either ligands 24 hours before the ethanol treatment resulted in a reduced anxiolytic effect of this drug. Only PK11195 reversed the effect of ethanol after intrahippocampal injection. These data suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptors play a role in ethanol anxiolysis.", 
    "146": "Inhibition of the field stimulation-induced twitch responses of the rabbit vas deferens by the muscarinic receptor agonist, McN-A-343, has been attributed to presynaptic muscarinic receptors of the M1 subtype located on noradrenergic nerve terminals. Stimulation of these receptors causes inhibition of transmitter release and inhibition of the contractile response. However, the selectivity of McN-A-343 for M1 receptors has been questioned and this throws doubt on whether the prejunctional receptors of the rabbit vas deferens are of the M1 subtype. In this study we have undertaken a comprehensive re-evaluation of the inhibition of prostatic and epididymal portions of the rabbit isolated field-stimulated vas deferens by several agonists, including McN-A-343, and quantified the antagonism by M1-selective antagonists, pirenzepine and telenzepine. Prostatic and epididymal portions of vasa deferentia from New Zealand White rabbits were immersed in a low Ca2+ Krebs solution at 32+/-0.5 degrees C gassed with 5% CO2 in oxygen. Yohimbine (1.0mM) was present throughout to block prejunctional alpha2-adrenoceptors. Field stimulation was applied by repeated application of single pulses (30 V, 0.05 Hz, 0.5 ms) and isometric contractions recorded. Carbachol and oxotremorine initially potentiated the epididymal contractions but at higher concentrations there was inhibition. In the prostatic portion, oxotremorine only inhibited. McN-A-343 produced inhibitory responses only in both epididymal and prostatic portions. Pirenzepine shifted the concentration-response curves forthe inhibitory responses to oxotremorine to the right. However, the potentiation of the twitches also became more apparent with the lower concentrations of oxotremorine. Schild plots for the antagonism by pirenzepine yielded pA2 values of 7.96+/-0.004 and 7.7+/-0.02 for the epididymal and prostatic portions, respectively. The concentration-response curves for the inhibition of twitches by McN-A-343 were displaced to the right in a parallel manner by pirenzepine in both prostatic and epididymal portions with no potentiation of the twitches. The Schild plot for this antagonism generated pA2 values of 7.68+/-0.01 and 8.07+/-0.01, respectively. Telenzepine caused parallel shifts of the McN-A-343 concentration-response curves to the right in prostatic portions, the pA2 value being 8.70+/-0.13. Telenzepine (10(-7) M) abolished the inhibitory effect of carbachol to reveal only concentration-dependent potentiation of the contractions. The Schild plot for antagonism of this contractile effect yielded a pA2 value (7.07+/-0.09) that was significantly less by almost two orders of magnitude (1.70) than the value for the antagonism by telenzepine of the McN-A-343-induced inhibitory response. The pA2 values of pirenzepine and telenzepine against the inhibitory responses of the rabbit vas deferens are consistent with the involvement of M1 receptors. This leads to the conclusion that McN-A-343 causes inhibition through this receptor type. The doubts concerning the selectivity of McN-A-343 for M1 receptors are therefore unfounded. The fact that McN-A-343 does not display a selective binding profile suggests that its selectivity does not arise from affinity differences but probably resides in its intrinsic efficacy.", 
    "147": "Human serum albumin (HSA) was immobilised on the gold surface of a quartz crystal resonance sensor (QCRS) and exposed to warfarin and diazepam. Distinct decreases in frequency of differing magnitudes were observed upon exposure of the protein to each of the compounds suggesting strongly that a ligand interaction was occurring. Moreover, as sequential exposure in any order was observed to yield distinct repeatable frequency decreases for the ligands indicated, screening for site specific binding may be possible. Identically immobilised bovine serum albumin (BSA) gave no response to either compound.",

    "157": "Maternal outcome assessed by obstetrical records and acute neonatal outcome assessed by Apgar scores were positive. Based on neonatal records, there were no cases of orofacial anomalies, neonatal apnea, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, or temperature or other autonomic dysregulation.

    "158": "Clonazepam use during pregnancy did not appear to be directly related to any obstetric complications during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. There was no evidence of neonatal toxicity or withdrawal syndromes in babies born to mothers who took clonazepam during pregnancy. Absence of serious maternal or neonatal compromise following clonazepam use during pregnancy in these mothers and infants is somewhat reassuring. One case of hypotonia and 1 case of respiratory distress in babies who were exposed to clonazepam in combination with imipramine at the time of delivery may suggest that coadministration of benzodiazepines with other psychotropic medications may require close neonatal observation.", 
    "159": "Canine cytochromes P450 3A12 and 3A26 are identical in sequence at 481 of 503 amino-acid positions but exhibit different substrate specificities. A recent study utilizing chimeric enzymes and site-directed mutagenesis identified three residues (187, 368, and 369) that contribute to differences in steroid hydroxylation and also indicated the presence of additional determinants of specificity among the 44 carboxyl terminal residues. Therefore, three 3A26 multiple mutants (I187T-S368P-V369I-S467P, I187T-S368P-V369I-S474P, and I187T-S368P-V369I-R476K-I477L-T479A-R480Q) were constructed. Insertion of 3A12 residue Pro-474 into 3A26 I187T-S368P-V369I resulted in metabolite profiles with testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone very similar to 3A12. Substitution of Pro-474 with Ser in P450 3A12 or human 3A4 significantly increased 2beta-hydroxylase activity with all three steroids. Residue 474 was also found to be an important contributor to diazepam metabolism by the canine and human enzymes. The results provide further evidence for the role of steric constraints exerted by the enzyme in P450 3A-mediated oxidations.",

In particular, solid phase synthesis is the core technology for combinatorial chemistry and is widely used for generating libraries of structurally related compounds. Since many drugs contain the nitrogen heterocyclic component and since heterocycles possess a high order of structural diversity, a precise overview of recent progress in the combinatorial synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles using solid phase methodology would be useful. Since the progress in solid phase synthesis of organic molecules has been reviewed regularly from 1992 to 1998, only the development of solid phase combinatorial synthetic approaches of small nitrogen heterocycles since 1999 will be reviewed here.
