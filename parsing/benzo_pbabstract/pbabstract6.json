GABAergic neurons are located in spinal nociceptive circuits suggesting that drugs with affinity at these receptors, including benzodiazepine-like drugs, may provide an alternative to opioids for the treatment of pain. However, systemically administered conventional benzodiazepines fail to produce antihyperalgesic effects, likely due to their concurrent sedative properties. Recent evidence suggests that by targeting specific benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA-A receptor subtypes, the sedative properties of benzodiazepines can be circumvented and these compounds may be useful alternatives to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. The present review provides an overview of the GABA-A receptor subtypes involved in pain transmission as well as implications for the development of analgesic medications.",

The identification of some DBZD metabolites has been mostly explored by self-administration studies or by in vitro studies followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The question arose whether a unit resolution instrument could be efficient enough to allow the identification of DBZD metabolites. In this study, we used an in vitro experiment where eight DBZDs (diclazepam, flubromazepam, etizolam, deschloroetizolam, flubromazolam, nifoxipam, meclonazepam and clonazolam) were incubated with human liver microsomes (HLMs) and metabolite identification was carried out by using a UHPLC coupled to a QTRAP triple quadrupole linear iontrap tandem mass spectrometer system. Post-mortem samples obtained from a real poisoning case, involving deschloroetizolam and diclazepam, were also analysed and discussed. Our study using HLM allowed the identification of 26 metabolites of the 8 DBZDs. These were denitro-, mono- or di-hydroxylated and desmethyl metabolites. In the forensic case, diclazepam was not detected whereas its metabolites (lormetazepam and lorazepam) were present at high concentrations in urine. We also identified hydroxy-deschloroetizolam in urine, while the parent compound was not detected in this matrix.

KA reliably induces severe, prolonged seizures, that is, convulsive status epilepticus (cSE), which is typically fatal without pharmacologic intervention. Although the use of KA to model human epilepsy has proven unquestionably valuable for >30\u00a0years, significant variability and mortality continue to confound results. These issues are probably the consequence of cSE, an all-or-nothing response that is inherently capricious and uncontrollable. The relevance of cSE to the human condition is dubious, however, as most patients with epilepsy never experienced it. We sought to develop a simple, KA-based animal model of TLE that avoids cSE and its confounds.",

Widespread hippocampal neurodegeneration was detected after 4\u00a0days. Spontaneous, focal hippocampal seizures began after an average of 12\u00a0days in all animals. Classic hippocampal sclerosis and mossy fiber sprouting characterized the long-term neuropathology. Morbidity and mortality rates were both 0%.",

This means that lorazepam can block convulsive seizures without truly stopping seizure activity.

This study reports the mechanism of action of novel GABAA antagonists based on a tricyclic oxazolo-2,3-benzodiazepine scaffold. These compounds are orthosteric antagonists of GABA on heteropentameric GABAA receptors of \u03b1x\u03b22\u03b32 configuration expressed in HEK293 cells. In silico modelling predicted that the test compounds docked in the GABA binding-pocket and would interact with amino-acid residues in the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunit interface that are known to be important for the binding of GABA. Intriguingly, optimal docking also required an interaction with the non-conserved amino-terminal segment of Loop-F of the \u03b1-subunit. Testing of a compound with altered regiochemistry of the oxazolone moiety supported the model with respect to the conserved GABA-interacting residues in vitro as well as in vivo. The prediction regarding loop-F was examined by replacing the amino-terminal variable segment of loop-F of the \u03b15-subunit with the corresponding residues in the \u03b11- and \u03b12-subunits. When tested with the novel inhibitors, the receptors formed by the modified \u03b15-subunits displayed the pharmacologic phenotype of the source of loop-F. In summary, these data show that the variable amino-terminal segment of loop-F of the \u03b1-subunit determines the pharmacologic selectivity of the novel tricyclic inhibitors of GABAA receptors.",

Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) at \u03b12/\u03b13-subtype GABAA receptors may have analgesic potential. Here we report a new selective \u03b12/\u03b13-subtype GABAA receptor PAM in in vitro and in vivo pain assays. KRM-II-81 demonstrated similar efficacy at \u03b11/\u03b12/\u03b13 GABAA receptors and negligible efficacy at \u03b14/\u03b15/\u03b16 GABAA receptors, with \u03b12 and \u03b13-subtypes being 17- and 28-fold more potent than \u03b11 subtypes in HEK-293T cells expressing GABAA receptors with different \u03b1 subunits.

Both PAMs and morphine dose-dependently decreased 0.6% acetic acid- and 0.32% lactic acid-induced writhing. The effects of both PAMs were reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, confirming their action at the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors. Both PAMS and morphine all dose-dependently reversed 0.32% lactic acid (but not 0.6% acetic acid) induced suppression of nesting behavior. Acetaminophen, but not the PAMs, reversed acid-depressed locomotor activity.

    "84": "Rutin is a bioflavonoid found in medicinal plants used to reduce anxiety. Evidence is lacking of rutin's anxiolytic-like activity, putative mechanism(s) of action, and neural sites of effects. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is the main brain region that regulates anxiety, through GABAA/benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors, which are modulated by flavonoids. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate whether the anxiolytic-like effect of rutin involves GABAA/BDZ receptors in the BLA. Rutin was administered systemically (30-1000\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or microinjected into the BLA (16\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, intracerebral), and its effects were assessed in the elevated plus-maze and open-field tests. Diazepam (1\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal, or 7\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, respectively) was used as a positive control. The mechanism of action was studied using flumazenil (BDZ antagonist, 5\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal, or 7\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, intracerebral) or picrotoxin (chloride channel GABAA antagonist, 0.3\u2009nmol/4\u2009\u00b5l, intracerebral). Rutin, administered systemically or intra-amygdala, induced anxiolytic-like responses, similar to those of diazepam. The effect of diazepam was completely blocked by flumazenil, which also partly antagonized the effects of systemic rutin. By contrast, flumazenil exerted no effect and picrotoxin had only a partial action when rutin was infused in the BLA. These results suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of rutin in the BLA involves GABAergic neurotransmission that is not associated with BDZ receptors.",

NMS is manifested by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, altered mental status, leukocytosis, and elevated serum creatinine phosphokinase. Valproate is commonly used in the treatment of many psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Valproate can precipitate NMS, especially when used with antipsychotic drugs concurrently.

Oral midazolam was reported as standard premedication by 84% of respondents, the second largest group was 'no premedication' (5%). The first choice prevention strategy was to perform total intravenous (propofol) anesthesia (63%). The first choice therapeutic pharmacological treatment depended on clinical experience. Therapeutic propofol was preferentially chosen by more experienced anesthesiologists (5 to >20 patients per week, n\u00a0=\u00a0538), while lesser experienced colleagues (<5 patients per week, n\u00a0=\u00a0676) preferentially applied opioids.

These compounds can differ significantly in receptor affinity, potency and duration of action, and an important structural difference is the ligand in the 4 position of the phenyl ring, such as propyl in 2C-P or bromine in 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B). The 2C drugs are known for their hallucinogenic properties. We present a case of a 19-year-old male admitted to the emergency department with severe hallucinations, mydriasis, tachycardia, agitation and confusion following the use of a substance sold as 2C-B. By using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the more potent substance 2C-P was detected and quantified. On the basis of two blood sample concentrations, the estimated elimination half-life was 19 h. This case report illustrates and discusses the differences in potency and duration of action of 2C drugs.",

Herein we describe the preparation of nanoemulsions with a dietary supplement; wheat germ oil (WGO), to ameliorate the liver damage induced by clozapine and olanzapine. THLE-2 cell line was used as a model to investigate the effects of these nanoemulsions on cell viability as well as antioxidative efficiency after antipsychotic insult. In this context, a conventional cell culture method; MTT was used along with a novel cellular imaging technique called digital holography (DH) to evaluate cell viability. Obtained data confirmed that both clozapine and olanzapine induced the liver damage in in vitro model and WGO nanoemulsions were found to be effective on cells and eliminate the cytotoxic effects of these drugs. Briefly, this study has some outputs as follows; it showed that different dietary supplements can be used in such formulations instead of their pristine forms to increase bioavailability. Also, DH was successfully applied for the monitoring of cell viability and it could be a promising approach as the reactive-free cytotoxicity test.",

Our aim was to clarify this using large-scale primary health care data from Sweden. The present study covered 71 primary health care centres containing individual-level data from a total of 919, 941 individuals who visited a primary health care centre (PHCC) during the period 2001-2007. From this database we selected individuals 25 years or older with depression, anxiety and/or insomnia and who were prescribed a benzodiazepine within 0-90 as well as 91-270 days after their first clinical diagnosis of depression, anxiety and/or insomnia. Older age (OR, 2.92, 95% CI, 2.28-3.84), middle SES (OR, 1.22, 95% CI, 1.08-1.38), being on social welfare (OR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.23-1.62) and not being married were associated with higher long-term benzodiazepine use. The PHCCs only explained a small part of the individual variation in long-term benzodiazepine use. Awareness of the impact on long-term benzodiazepine use of certain individual-level socio-demographic factors is important for health care workers and decision-makers who should aim at targeting general interventions at all primary health care centres.",

Firstly, water-soluble organic solvents were used to improve the aqueous solubility directly, secondly, ionic surfactants were used to solubilise the model drug, and thirdly, complexation of lorazepam with cyclodextrin was studied. Specific attention was paid to excipients, adequate taste correction and palatability. For the final formulation, physical and chemical stability and microbiological quality were assessed for 12months.",

Development of the non-ionic surfactants formulation was discontinued due to taste problems. The cyclodextrin formulations were physically stable, but lorazepam content declined to 90% within five months. The final formulation contained in volume concentration (%v/v) 87% glycerol, 10% polyethylene glycol 400 and 3% propylene glycol. Orange essence was the preferred taste corrector. The formulation remained stable for 12months at 4\u00b0C, with lorazepam content remaining >95%. Related substances increased during the study period but remained below 2%.

A subsequent e-mail alert, generated by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine and sent to relevant medical specialists (including neurologists, neuroradiologists, and emergency physicians), resulted in the identification of 10 additional cases that had occurred during 2012-2016. All 14 patients (mean and median age = 35 years) had been evaluated at hospitals in eastern Massachusetts. Thirteen of the 14 patients underwent routine clinical toxicology screening at the time of initial evaluation; eight tested positive for opioids, two for cocaine, and two for benzodiazepines. Apart from sporadic cases (2-6), this combination of clinical and imaging findings has been reported rarely. The apparent temporospatial clustering, relatively young age at onset (19-52 years), and associated substance use among these patients should stimulate further case identification to determine whether these observations represent an emerging syndrome related to substance use or other causes (e.g., a toxic exposure).",

However, the accurate implication of the two specific ligands of tropomyosin kinase B receptor, BDNF and neurotrophic factor 4 (NT4/5), has not been studied in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The present study investigated the significance of serum BDNF and the NT4/5 in association with the intake of psychoactive drugs in CRC patients. Soluble BDNF and NT4 in the serum were assessed by ELISA. Although no correlation of BDNF and NT4 with the CRC stage was identified, a positive correlation was found between NT4 and the intake of psychoactive drugs (P=0.0457). For BDNF, a correlation was found in particular with the intake of benzodiazepine (P=0.0221). As BDNF and NT4/5 are implicated in the response of psychoactive treatments applied to manage depression, which frequently occurs in cancer patients, they cannot be used as prognostic or diagnostic markers for CRC in these patients. However, high expression of BDNF and NT4 was significantly associated with better survival. Therefore, these NTs may be used as markers for monitoring depression or predicting survival in CRC patients.",

On the ipsilateral side of C5 and T1 levels, (18)F-FDG uptake increased significantly (*p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and was correlated with the rate of progression of the ALS FRS-R-U/E score (R\u00a0=\u00a00.645, *p\u00a0=\u00a00.041). Despite this hyperglucose metabolism, the (11)C-FMZ PET study did not show a coupled increase of spinal blood flow even though neuronal intensity did not decrease. These results indicate a strong correlation between hyperglucose metabolism and ALS progression alongside the uncoupling of flow-metabolism.

    "159": "The major subunit isoform of GABAA receptors is \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32. The subunits are thought to surround an ion pore with the counterclockwise arrangement \u03b11\u03b32\u03b22\u03b11\u03b22 as seen from the outside of the neuron. These receptors have two agonist sites and one high affinity drug binding site specific for benzodiazepines. Recently, this receptor was postulated to assume alternative subunit stoichiometries and arrangements resulting in only one agonist site and one or even two sites for benzodiazepines. In order to force a defined subunit arrangement we expressed a combination of triple and dual concatenated subunits. Here we report that these unconventional receptors express only small current amplitudes in Xenopus oocytes. We determined agonist properties and modulation by diazepam of two of these receptors that resulted in currents large enough for a characterization, that is, \u03b22-\u03b11-\u03b32/\u03b11-\u03b32 and \u03b22-\u03b11-\u03b32/\u03b22-\u03b32. The first pentamer predicted to have two benzodiazepine binding sites shows similar response to diazepam as the standard receptor. As expected for both receptors with a single predicted agonist site the concentration response curves for GABA were characterized by a Hill coefficient < 1. \u03b22-\u03b11-\u03b32/\u03b22-\u03b32 displayed a mM apparent GABA affinity for channel opening instead of the expected \u03bcM affinity. Based on their subunit and binding site stoichiometry, that contradicts all previous observations, their unusual functional properties and their very low expression levels in oocytes, we consider it unlikely that these unconventional receptors are expressed in neurons to an appreciable extent.", 
    "160": "Propofol sedation is increasingly used for standard and advanced endoscopies due to its advantages over traditional sedation based on benzodiazepines and/or opioids. These include a better sedation, greater patient cooperation, and higher patient satisfaction for most endoscopic procedures; it also decreases time to sedation and decreases recovery and discharge times. As anesthesiologists have typically provided propofol-based sedation, the increase in its use is limited by anesthesiologists' availability and cost. Non-anesthesiologist administration of propofol has thus emerged as an alternative that is slowly gaining acceptance. This Editorial puts into perspective discussions that have recently taken place in Spain about the safety of non-anesthesiologist administration of propofol. It aims at refocusing the debate on facts, with the hope that an agreement between anesthesiologists, endoscopists and nurses will be achieved. Anesthesiologists' support is essential to ensure that the transition that endoscopists are making from traditional to propofol sedation is safe.",

A population-based case-time-control study was performed using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who experienced an unplanned hospitalization (index visit) were identified as index subjects and matched to a randomly selected reference visit within users of a specific category of high-risk medication. An unplanned hospitalization was defined as a hospital admission immediately after an emergency department visit. Discordant exposures to the high-risk medication during the case period (1-14 days before the visit) and the control period (366-379 days before the visit) were examined in both index and reference visits. Antipsychotics was associated with the highest risk of unplanned hospitalizations (adjusted OR: 1.54, 95% CI [1.37-1.73]), followed by NSAIDs (1.50, [1.44-1.56]), anticonvulsants (1.34, [1.10-1.64]), diuretics (1.24, [1.15-1.33]), BZD/Z-hypnotics (1.23, [1.16-1.31]), antidepressants (1.17, [1.05-1.31]) and antiplatelets (1.16, [1.07-1.26]).

    "165": "Midazolam is a positive allosteric modulator at GABAA receptor that induces a short hypnosis and neuroplasticity, in which the sequential phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was shown to play a role. This study investigated the parallel activation of p-MEK and p-ERK and regulatory mechanisms induced by midazolam through the stimulation of GABAA receptors in the mouse brain. During the time course of midazolam (60mg/kg)-induced sleep in mice (lasting for about 2h) p-Ser217/221 MEK1/2 was increased (+146% to +258%) whereas, unexpectedly, p-Tyr204/Thr202 ERK1/2 was found decreased (-16% to -38%), revealing uncoupling of MEK to ERK signals in various brain regions. Midazolam-induced p-MEK1/2 upregulation was prevented by pretreatment (30min) with flumazenil (10mg/kg), indicating the involvement of GABAA receptors. Also unexpectedly, midazolam-induced p-ERK1/2 downregulation was not prevented by flumazenil (10 or 30mg/kg). Notably, during midazolam-induced sleep the content of inactivated p-Thr286 MEK1, which can dampen ERK1/2 activation, was increased (+33% to +149%) through a mechanism sensitive to flumazenil (10mg/kg). Midazolam also increased MKP-3 (+13% to +73%) content and this upregulation was prevented by flumazenil (10mg/kg); an effect suggesting ERK inactivation because MKP-3 is the phosphatase selective for ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. The results indicate that during midazolam-induced sleep in mice there is an uncoupling of p-MEK (increased) to p-ERK (decreased) signals. p-ERK1/2 downregulation (not involving GABAA receptors) is the result of increased inactivated MEK1 and phosphatase MKP-3 (both effects involving GABAA receptors). These findings are relevant for the neurobiology and clinical use of benzodiazepines.",

    "170": "Organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNAs) are irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase that pose a serious threat to public health because of their use as chemical weapons. Exposure to high doses of OPNAs can dramatically potentiate cholinergic synaptic activity and cause status epilepticus (SE). Current standard of care for OPNA exposure involves treatment with cholinergic antagonists, oxime cholinesterase reactivators, and benzodiazepines. However, data from pre-clinical models suggest that OPNA-induced SE rapidly becomes refractory to benzodiazepines. Neuroactive steroids (NAS), such as allopregnanolone, retain anticonvulsant activity in rodent models of benzodiazepine-resistant SE, perhaps because they modulate a broader variety of GABAA receptor subtypes. SGE-516 is a novel, next generation NAS and a potent and selective GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM). The present study first established that SGE-516 reduced electrographic seizures in the rat lithium-pilocarpine model of pharmacoresistant SE. Then the anticonvulsant activity of SGE-516 was investigated in the soman-intoxication model of OPNA-induced SE. SGE-516 (5.6, 7.5, and 10mg/kg, IP) significantly reduced electrographic seizure activity compared to control when administered 20min after SE onset. When 10mg/kg SGE-516 was administered 40min after SE onset, seizure activity was still significantly reduced compared to control. In addition, all cohorts of rats treated with SGE-516 exhibited significantly reduced neuronal cell death as measured by FluoroJade B immunohistochemistry. These data suggest synthetic NASs that positively modulate both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors may be candidates for further study in the treatment of OPNA-induced SE.",

To determine the effects of a butorphanol and midazolam premedication on general anesthesia and quality of induction and recovery phases in psittacid species, 17 clinically healthy birds undergoing anesthesia were randomly allocated into either a premedicated or control group. Anesthetic parameters were subsequently compared. Induction time and isoflurane concentration required for anesthetic maintenance were reduced in the premedicated group. Induction quality scores were improved in the premedicated group and no adverse effects on anesthesia and cardiovascular stability were observed. Use of a combined butorphanol and midazolam premedication in clinically healthy psittacine birds appears safe and effective. Premedication provides a beneficial effect at induction and enables maintenance levels of anesthetic gas to be reduced.",

    "182": "Benzodiazepines ameliorate or prevent the symptoms and complications of moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal, which can include autonomic hyperactivity, agitation, combativeness, hallucinations, seizures, delirium, and death. The benzodiazepines most commonly used for this purpose are lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, and diazepam. It is widely asserted that no member of this group is superior to the others for treatment of alcohol withdrawal. However, of these, diazepam has the shortest time to peak effect, which facilitates both rapid control of symptoms and accurate titration to avoid over-sedation. Furthermore, diazepam and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, have the longest elimination half-lives, so their levels decrease in a gradual, self-tapering manner, resulting in a smoother withdrawal, i.e., a lower incidence and severity of both breakthrough symptoms and rebound phenomena, including a possibly decreased seizure risk. Importantly, the fear of increased risk of over-sedation with diazepam compared with other benzodiazepines is based on a misunderstanding of its pharmacokinetics and is unfounded. Similarly, the notion that diazepam should be avoided in patients with liver disease and elderly patients to avoid prolonged over-sedation is based on no more than conjecture. In fact, there is clinical evidence that diazepam is safe for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in these patients when administered using a simple symptom-based approach. There is one instance in which diazepam should not be used: when intramuscular administration is the only option, the lipophilicity of diazepam can result in slow absorption-either lorazepam or, when rapid control of symptoms is required, midazolam should be used. The comparative pharmacokinetics of the benzodiazepines used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal together with a comprehensive review of the literature on their use strongly suggest that diazepam should be the preferred benzodiazepine for the treatment of patients experiencing moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal under most circumstances.", 
    "183": "Evacetrapib is a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor that has been recently studied as a cholesterol modifying agent to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality in high risk cardiovascular disease patients. Evacetrapib acts to decrease lipid exchange through CETP inhibition. CETP acts to transfer cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C). HDL-C is involved in reverse cholesterol transport and its blood levels have been shown to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular risk. Thus, a pharmacologic agent that can elevate HDL-C has been seen as an exciting area of research. In recent studies, evacetrapib was shown to be safe and efficacious. It produced an increase in HDL-C up to 128% and a 35% decrease in LDL-C, in comparison to placebo. In addition, evacetrapib was also shown to be more potent than previous CETP inhibitors. HDL-C particles treated with evacetrapib remained functional and had improved cholesterol efflux. A previously studied CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, exhibited side effects of hyperaldosteronism, manifesting in electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension. These detrimental effects were not seen with evacetrapib. Recently, the results of evacetrapib's phase III ACCELERATE trial showed no significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events or mortality, and the drug will not be marketed. Although beneficial cholesterol effects were seen with this drug, more needs to be known to understand what role, if any, evacetrapib has in the reduction of cardiovascular risk.",

However, there has been overuse of non-opioid adjunct analgesics that caused significant adverse effects in addition to concurrent opioid consumption. It is a common practice to extrapolate the WHO three-step analgesic ladder for cancer pain to apply in non-cancer pain that emphasizes solely on pharmacologic therapy which may result in overuse and escalation of opioids in non-cancer pain. There has been promising progress in non-pharmacologic therapies such as biofeedback, complementary, and alternative medicine to facilitate pain control instead of dependency on pharmacologic therapies.

This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with NMPDU for drug classes insufficiently described in opioid-dependent populations, including antihistaminergic anxiolytics and central stimulants. Methods. Study participants were recruited at two OMT clinics in Malmo, Sweden, between October 2014 and December 2015 (N = 73) and interviewed about their use, motivations for use, and acquisition and administration of prescription drugs. Results. The majority of the sample reported lifetime NMPDU: 60% for benzodiazepine-like hypnotics (z-drugs), 21% for pregabalin, 19% for stimulants, and 12%-15% for antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Lower age was associated with nonmedical benzodiazepine use (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.89; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.82-0.97). Illicit acquisition was reported by 61% of people using z-drugs, 46% of people using pregabalin, and 38% of people using prescription stimulants, but only by 6-10% of people using antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Conclusions. The substantial nonmedical use of pregabalin, z-drugs, and prescription stimulants found in this study suggests that clinicians should prescribe these drugs with great caution. Nonmedical use of antihistaminergic anxiolytics does not seem to be a clinical issue among people in OMT in a Swedish setting, but we propose future studies to monitor their use.",

    "202": "To date, thorough clean-up of complex biological samples remains an essential part of the analytical process. The solid phase extraction (SPE) technique is the well-known standard, however, its main weaknesses are the labor-intensive and time-consuming protocols. In this respect, dispersive liquid-liquid microextractions (DLLME) seem to offer less complex and more efficient extraction procedures. Furthermore, ionic liquids (ILs) - liquid salts - are emerging as new promising extraction solvents, thanks to their non-flammable nature, negligible vapor pressure and easily adaptable physiochemical properties. In this study, we investigated whether ILs can be used as an extraction solvent in a DLLME procedure for the extraction of a broad range of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics in whole blood samples. 1.0mL whole blood was extracted using an optimized 30-min IL-based DLLME procedure, followed by LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS analysis in scheduled MRM scan mode. The optimized analytical method was successfully validated for 7-aminoflunitrazepam, alprazolam, bromazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, clotiazepam, diazepam, estazolam, ethyl loflazepate, etizolam, flurazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, oxazepam, prazepam, temazepam, triazolam, zolpidem and zopiclone. The method showed good selectivity for endogenous interferences based on 12 sources of blank whole blood. No benzodiazepine interferences were observed, except for clorazepate and nordiazepam, which were excluded from the quantitative method. Matrix-matched calibration curves were constructed covering the whole therapeutic range, including low toxic plasma concentrations. Accuracy and precision results met the proposed acceptance criteria for the vast majority of compounds, except for brotizolam, chlordiazepoxide, cloxazolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam and nitrazepam, which can only be determined in a semi-quantitative way. Recoveries were within the range of 24.7%-127.2% and matrix effects were within 20.0%-92.6%. Both parameters were tested using 5 sources of whole blood and coefficients of variance were below 20%. Overall, the applicability of ILs as promising solvents for the extraction of benzodiazepines in whole blood samples has been proven. Moreover, a fast and easy IL-based DLLME procedure was developed for the quantification of 19 benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics.",

    "204": "This is a cross-sectional study that included 451 nursing homes across France. Information about the medications received by the 30,702 residents (73.8% women) living in these nursing homes was extracted from the system that assists in the preparation of pill dispensers in pharmacies. The anonymized database included age, sex, and medications prescribed to residents, as well as nursing home characteristics (capacity, legal status). Factors associated with excessive polypharmacy (\u226510 different drugs) and PIMs according to the Laroche list were studied using multilevel regression models.", 
    "205": "The average number of drugs prescribed was 6.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3, and excessive polypharmacy concerned 21.1% of the residents (n\u00a0=\u00a06468). According to the Laroche list, 47.4% of residents (n\u00a0=\u00a014,547) received at least one PIM. Benzodiazepines (excessive doses, long-acting benzodiazepines, and combination of benzodiazepines) and anticholinergic medications (hydroxyzine, cyamemazine, alimemazine) accounted for a large part of PIMs. Individual characteristics (age, gender) influenced the risk of receiving PIMs whereas nursing home characteristics (capacity, legal status) influenced the risk of excessive polypharmacy.", 
    "206": "This study shows that polypharmacy and PIMs remain highly prevalent among nursing home residents. Main PIMs concerned psychotropic and anticholinergic medications.", 
    "207": "Persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) commonly present with chronic nonmalignant pain, but long-term use of opioids among this population has not been studied previously. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of long-term (\u2265180 days) use of opioids for nonmalignant pain and associated factors among community-dwelling persons with AD and to compare the prevalence with a matched cohort without AD. The Medication use and Alzheimer's disease (MEDALZ) cohort was used for this study, comprising all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD in Finland during 2005 to 2011 and their matched comparison persons without AD. After exclusion of persons with active cancer treatment, 62,074 persons with and 62,074 persons without AD were included in this study. Data were collected from nationwide registers. Opioids were used by 13,111 persons with and by 16,659 without AD. Overall long-term opioid use was more common among persons without AD (8.7%) than among persons with AD (7.2%, P < 0.0001). However, among opioid users, prevalence of long-term opioid use was slightly higher among persons with AD than among those without AD (34.2% vs 32.3%, respectively, P = 0.0004). Long-term use of transdermal opioids was more than 2-fold among opioid users with AD (13.2%) compared with users without AD (5.5%). Factors associated with long-term opioid use included AD, age \u226580 years, female sex, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, low socioeconomic position, history of substance abuse, and long-term benzodiazepine use. Prevalence of long-term opioid use was somewhat similar among both groups. Among persons with AD, long-term opioid use was strongly associated with transdermal opioids.", 
    "208": "We described a new model of risk behavior in rats that allows selection of animals predisposed to risk behavior in the absence of other biological motivations. Phenazepam administration did not change the intensity of risk behavior in \"risky\" animals, but stimulated risk behavior in rats that were not predisposed to it. Nicotine inhibited risk behavior in \"risky\" animals and strengthened it in \"cautious\" rats. In the intermediate group, the drugs did not induce significant changes. A similar effect of the drugs was observed in the previous models. More complex effect of nicotine on the risk behavior may be explained by the absence of severe food motivation typical for the early models.", 
    "209": "Meclonazepam is a benzodiazepine patented in 1977 to treat parasitic worms, which recently appeared as a designer benzodiazepine and drug of abuse. The aim of this study was to identify metabolites suitable as biomarkers of drug intake in urine using high-resolution mass spectrometry, authentic urine samples, and different model systems including human liver microsomes, cryopreserved hepatocytes, and a mice model. The main metabolites of meclonazepam found in human urine were amino-meclonazepam and acetamido-meclonazepam; also, minor peaks for meclonazepam were observed in three of four urine samples. These observations are consistent with meclonazepam having a metabolism similar to that of other nitro containing benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, flunitrazepam, and nitrazepam. Both metabolites were produced by the hepatocytes and in the mice model, but the human liver microsomes were only capable of producing minor amounts of the amino metabolite. However, under nitrogen, the amount of amino-meclonazepam produced increased 140 times. This study comprehensively elucidated meclonazepam metabolism and also illustrates that careful selection of in vitro model systems for drug metabolism is needed, always taking into account the expected metabolism of the tested drug.", 
    "210": "Previous investigation on the duration of untreated illness (DUI) in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) revealed a different latency to first antidepressant treatment, with adverse consequences in terms of outcome for individuals with a longer DUI. Recent reports, moreover, documented a reduced DUI, as observed with the passage of time, in patients with different psychiatric disorders. Hence, the present study was aimed to assess DUI and related variables in a sample of Italian patients with MDD as well as to investigate potential differences in subjects with onset before and after 2000.", 
    "211": "An overall sample of 188 patients with MDD was assessed through a specific questionnaire investigating DUI and other variables related to the psychopathological onset and latency to first antidepressant treatment, after dividing them in two different subgroups on the basis of their epoch of onset.", 
    "212": "The whole sample showed a mean DUI of approximately 4.5\u00a0years, with patients with more recent onset showing a significantly shorter latency to treatment compared with the other group (27.1\u00b142.6 vs 75.8\u00b1105.2\u00a0months, P<.05). Other significant differences emerged between the two subgroups, in terms of rates of onset-related stressful events and benzodiazepine prescription, respectively, higher and lower in patients with more recent onset.", 
    "213": "Our findings indicate a significant DUI reduction in MDD patients whose onset occurred after vs before 2000, along with other relevant differences in terms of onset-related correlates and first pharmacotherapy. Further studies with larger samples are warranted to confirm the present findings in Italy and other countries.", 
    "214": "In the Lancet Neurology article \"Prehospital treatment with levetiracetam plus clonazepam or placebo plus clonazepam in status epilepticus (SAMUKeppra): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial\" the authors conducted a prehospital, randomized controlled study to determine which treatment is more effective for status epilepticus (SE): benzodiazepine alone, or in combination with levetiracetam (LEV). Although the study had negative results, several aspects of the trial design likely masked any added effect that LEV may have had in controlling SE, including: higher doses of benzodiazepines, lower thresholds for determining cessation of SE, and a smaller sample size. Regardless, the study reaffirms the effectiveness and importance of early and adequate benzodiazepine dosing and helps guide us in designing future studies for treatment of SE.", 
    "215": "Activation of liver X receptor (LXR) is associated with cholesterol metabolism and anti-inflammatory processes, which makes it beneficial to antiatherosclerosis therapy. Nevertheless, existing agonists that target LXR, for example TO901317, are related to unwanted side effects. In the present study, using a screening method we identified IMB-808, which displayed potent dual LXR\u03b1/\u03b2 agonistic activity. In vitro, IMB-808 effectively increased the expressing quantity of genes related to reverse cholesterol transport process as well as those associated with cholesterol metabolism pathway in multiple cell lines. Additionally, IMB-808 remarkably promoted cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 as well as THP-1 macrophage cells and reduced cellular lipid accumulation accordingly. Interestingly, compared with TO901317, IMB-808 almost did not increase the expressing quantity of genes related to lipogenesis in HepG2 cells, which indicated that IMB-808 could exhibit fewer internal lipogenic side effects with a characteristic of selective LXR agonist. Furthermore, in comparison with the full LXR agonist TO901317, IMB-808 recruits coregulators differently and possesses a distinct predictive binding pattern for the LXR ligand-binding domain. In summary, our study demonstrated that IMB-808 could act as an innovative partial LXR agonist that avoids common lipogenic side effects, providing insight for the design of novel LXR modulators. Our data indicate that this compound might be used as a promising therapeutic agent for the prospective treatment of atherosclerosis in the future.", 
    "216": "Although hyperprolactinemia carries a long-term risk of morbidity, the threshold of dopamine D2/3 receptor (D2/3R) occupancy for hyperprolactinemia has not been investigated in older patients with schizophrenia. Data were taken from a positron emission tomography (PET) study conducted between August 2007 and August 2015. The present post hoc study included 42 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) (mean \u00b1 SD age = 60.2 \u00b1 6.7 years) taking olanzapine or risperidone. Subjects underwent [\u00b9\u00b9C]-raclopride PET scans to measure D2/3R occupancy before and after reducing their dose of antipsychotic by up to 40%. Blood samples were collected before each PET scan to measure prolactin levels.", 
    "217": "The relationship between prolactin levels and D2/3R occupancy was examined using stepwise linear regression analyses. The D2/3R occupancy thresholds for hyperprolactinemia were explored using Fisher exact tests.", 
    "218": "Prolactin levels decreased following dose reduction (mean \u00b1 SD = 24.1 \u00b1 30.2 ng/mL to 17.2 \u00b1 15.1 ng/mL; P < .001). Prolactin levels were associated with female gender (\u03b2 = .32, P = .006, vs male), antipsychotics (\u03b2 = .23, P = .02, risperidone vs olanzapine), and D2/3R occupancy (\u03b2 = .23, P = .04). Those with D2/3R occupancy of 66% or higher were more likely to have hyperprolactinemia than those with D2/3R occupancy lower than 66% (P = .03). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of this threshold were 0.44, 0.81, 0.78, and 0.48, respectively. We identified a D2/3R occupancy threshold for hyperprolactinemia of 66% in older patients with schizophrenia, which is lower than that reported in younger patients (73%) by other researchers.", 
    "219": "Our results suggest a higher sensitivity to antipsychotics in older patients. Prolactin levels could assist in the determination of appropriate antipsychotic dosing to minimize adverse effects.",

    "221": "A high-throughput method was developed for the detection of 31 benzodiazepine drugs and tandospirone in human plasma by on-line column-switching ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma samples (100\u03bcl) spiked with the 32 drugs and oxazepam-d5 (internal standard) were diluted with 300\u03bcl of 13.3mM ammonium acetate/acetonitrile (33:67, v/v). After centrifugation and filtration, the clear supernatant was injected directly onto the extraction column (Oasis HLB cartridge column). The following procedure was fully automated. The analytes retained on the extraction column were eluted by backflushing of the extraction column and introduced into an analytical column (SUMIPAX ODS D-Swifter column, 30mm\u00d73.0mm i.d.; particle size 2\u03bcm) by column switching. Quantification was performed by multiple reaction monitoring with positive-ion electrospray ionization. Distinct peaks appeared for each drug and the internal standard on each channel within 7min, including the extraction time. All drugs spiked into plasma showed recoveries of 83-95%. The regression equations for the 32 drugs showed excellent linearities in the range of 50-2000pg/ml of plasma and the limits of detection ranged from 20 to 50pg/ml. The lower and upper limits of quantitation were 50-100ng/ml and 2000pg/ml, respectively. Intra- and interday coefficients of variation for none of the drugs were greater than 13.6%. The accuracies of quantitation were 87-112%. The multiple reaction monitoring information-dependent acquisition of enhanced product ions method enabled the quantification and confirmation of diazepam, triazolam, and lorazepam obtained from actual plasma.", 
    "222": "To compare differences between clinician perceptions of therapeutic substitutes for antipsychotics prescribed to patients with dementia in long term care (LTC) and published evidence.", 
    "223": "A mixed-methods approach that included a drug information search, online survey of 55 LTC clinicians and a comprehensive literature review was used. For 41 pharmacologic antipsychotic substitute candidates identified, LTC clinicians rated the likelihood they would substitute each for patients with dementia and identified non-pharmacologic antipsychotic substitutes. The quality of evidence supporting the most likely antipsychotic substitutes was assessed using a modified GRADE approach.", 
    "224": "Among 36 (65%) of LTC clinicians responding, the pharmacologic candidates deemed likely or somewhat likely to be substituted for an antipsychotic were: valproic acid, serotonin modulator antidepressants, short-acting benzodiazepines, serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, buspirone, acetaminophen, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, memantine, and a cholinesterase inhibitor. High quality evidence supporting these substitutions existed for only memantine and cholinesterase inhibitors, while high quality evidence cautioning against this substitution existed for valproic acid. Activities and music therapy were the most commonly cited non-pharmacologic substitutes but the supporting evidence for each is sparse.", 
    "225": "Perceptions of LTC clinicians regarding substitutes for antipsychotics in LTC patients with dementia vary widely and are often discordant with published evidence."
