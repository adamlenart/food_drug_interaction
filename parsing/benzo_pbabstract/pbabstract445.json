Propranolol transport was augmented significantly by the presence of 4% (v/v) alkane or alkanol in the vehicle; diazepam and indomethacin, on the other hand, were enhanced only by n-nonane. Experiments with saturated solutions of the drugs as the donor phase revealed that the actions of the enhancers were taking place in the skin and were not a result of an alteration of solute thermodynamic activity in the vehicle. In separate runs, the impact of n-nonane and 1-nonanol on the percutaneous penetration of ethanol was determined. Temporal effects identical to those on the flux of propranolol were observed. A further measurement revealed that the penetration of 1-decanol, when administered as a 4% (v/v) solution in ethanol, followed a profile similar to that of the solvent (which, in turn, was comparable with that of the independently assessed propranolol hydrochloride). Thus, considerable linkage exists between the transport of a hydrophilic drug and the major vehicle component in the presence of n-nonane and 1-nonanol. The lipophilic drugs, conversely, were promoted only by n-nonane and only after most of the ethanol had been absorbed. The results show that an apparent synergy of transport between a putative enhancer and a cosolvent may not always lead to augmented drug flux. Study of the transport of all key formulation components is recommended, therefore, to optimize vehicles for transdermal drug delivery.", 
    "1": "The in situ modification of an immobilized human serum albumin (HSA) high-performance liquid chromatographic chiral stationary phase by p-nitrophenyl acetate is reported. This procedure, which is thought to affect primarily a single reactive tyrosine residue within the protein structure, influenced the chromatographic retention and enantioselectivity factors of a wide range of solutes. For certain solutes, increases in both capacity factor and chiral resolution were observed. Ultrafiltration studies on representative test solutes using free HSA, treated in a similar manner to the immobilized protein, gave similar results as the chromatographic observations, indicating that the latter effects are not artifactual results of immobilization. The effect of the modification of HSA on the binding behavior of drugs reportedly sharing the site predominantly affected by the derivatization, namely, the indole-benzodiazepine binding site, varied greatly. This observation suggests that the affected binding area is not a single, tightly structurally defined site.", 
    "2": "The effect of adinazolam release rate on psychomotor performance and sedation was assessed by administering 40 mg adinazolam mesylate immediate-release (CT) tablets, 60 mg sustained-release (SR) tablets, and placebo in a double-blind crossover study in 15 healthy male subjects. A separate panel of 16 subjects received the above single doses and multiple-dose regimens of 40 mg CT tablets every 8 hr and 60 mg SR tablets every 12 hr according to a crossover design. Psychomotor performance was assessed by digit symbol substitution test, card sorting tasks, and sedation ratings. Following single-dose administration, dose-corrected adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD) AUC values were equivalent for SR and CT tablets. Peak adinazolam and NDMAD levels were lower and occurred later for the SR tablets. Decrements in card sorting were 50 and 3% at 1 hr and 17 and 20% at 6 hr for the CT and SR tablets, respectively. Maximal sedation scores were lower for the SR tablets compared to the CT. Dose-corrected AUC was comparable between single and multiple doses for both adinazolam and NDMAD; no differences were observed in 24-hr AUC at steady-state between CT and SR tablets. Fluctuation ratios were reduced for both adinazolam and NDMAD following SR tablets. Psychomotor and sedative effects were attenuated upon multiple dosing. Thus, the reduction in peak plasma NDMAD following SR tablet administration results in a lesser sedation and psychomotor impairment on acute administration, and tolerance to these effects occurs on multiple dosing.", 
    "3": "The O-demethylation of codeine (methylmorphine) into morphine is mediated by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 DB1 (P450 IID6). By means of in vitro screening in human liver microsomes we have studied the effect on codeine bioactivation of several drugs used as analgesics or as adjuvants for pain control. In microsomes from an extensive metabolizer subject, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, indomethacin, piroxicam, and pirprofen), benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, and midazolam), and anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and phenytoin) did not alter the reaction. There was marked inhibition of in vitro morphine production by neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, levomepromazine, and thioridazine), metoclopramide, and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, and nortriptyline). Enzyme kinetics showed competitive inhibition by neuroleptics (chlorpromazine Ki = 0.5 microM) and antidepressants (clomipramine Ki = 6.8 microM), which are substrates of the polymorphic monooxygenase. Due to the low affinity of codeine for P450 DB1 (Km = 100-200 microM), its bioactivation in extensive metabolizers, and thus its analgesic efficacy, is liable to vary greatly when it is combined with any drug that has a high affinity for the polymorphic isozyme.", 
    "4": "A comparative study of three treatment modalities, pharmacologic, occlusal appliance, and their combined use, was conducted to test their therapeutic efficacy on 61 temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients. Alprazolam (Xanax) was used for the pharmacologic treatment; the occlusal appliance therapy consisted of a flat maxillary stabilization splint. Of the 61 patients, 19 received Alprazolam, 30 received occlusal appliance therapy, and 12 received combined therapy. Subjects were examined at two-week intervals for two months. Only 42 patients attended all follow-up visits. Eight parameters were studied: severity of pain, periodicity of pain, self-evaluated stress, muscle sensitivity to palpation, joint sensitivity to palpation, joint noises, limitation of opening, and limitation of lateral movement. No significant difference was found between the treatment modalities for most of the parameters. All three proved to be effective. Alprazolam increased the restricted mandibular movement, was least effective on joint sensitivity to palpation, and had no effect on joint noises. The combined treatment approach not only failed to prove superior to the other treatments, but showed less improvement in some parameters, possibly due to the small sample.", 
    "5": "An apparent circadian rhythm of plasma uric acid and the effect of handling stress on plasma uric acid level in conscious cebus monkeys were demonstrated. The lowest level of plasma uric acid in the circadian rhythm occurred early in the morning and the highest, before bedtime at night. With experimental handling stress, the plasma uric acid level rose to much more than the maximum level of the circadian rhythm. Stress-induced hyperuricemia could be inhibited without an increase of urinary uric acid excretion by the minor tranquilizer diazepam at doses of more than 1 mg/kg, p.o. On the other hand, benzbromarone at 20 mg/kg, p.o. significantly inhibited the hyperuricemia with a hyperuricosuric effect, while probenecid at 50 mg/kg, p.o. had no effect on either the increased plasma uric acid or urinary uric acid excretion. Accordingly, it is concluded that the plasma uric acid level in conscious cebus monkeys easily fluctuates with experimental conditions and that the animals can be utilized to evaluate the hypouricemic and hyperuricosuric property of benzbromarone-like agents.", 
    "6": "Experiments on isolated strips of the non-pregnant rabbit and rat uterus showed the ability of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, acetylcholine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, oxytocin to increase the uterine strips contractile activity. On the other hand, GABA, GABAB receptors agonist phenibut and diazepam inhibit the stimulating effects of the above mentioned substances, thus showing the properties of physiological antagonists of these neuromediators, prostaglandin and oxytocin.", 
    "7": "It has been shown, that antipyrine, nifedipine, diazepam pharmacokinetics changes in different ways after myocardial infarction. On day 7, 14, and 21 after myocardial ischemia antipyrine T1/2 increased considerably, and antipyrine Cl and Kel decreased. Nifedipine T1/2 increased on day 7 only. There were no diazepam pharmacokinetic changes during restoration period. However, microsomal diazepam metabolism changed significantly. Diazepam hydroxylation increased on day 7 of myocardial infarction, and on day 14 and 21 did not differ from the control. Diazepam metabolites content changed considerably during restoration period. Under myocardial infarction cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, oxidizing present substances seem to be altered to different extent.", 
    "8": "A 77-year-old woman who had undergone surgery of a non-malignant extracerebral retro-orbital tumor suffered postoperatively from respiratory failure due to impaired respiratory drive and unconsciousness of unknown origin and required artificial ventilation for 14 days. After cerebral and endocrinological causes had been excluded, the residual effects of diazepam were taken into consideration, since the patient had received this substance for premedication and during 3 days postoperatively (total 165 mg). After the application of flumazenil (Anexate), a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, she awoke immediately and was extubated with sufficient spontaneous breathing. The hypothesis that diazepam was the causative agent for the respiratory failure and impaired consciousness was supported by the detection of high serum concentrations of diazepam and its active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. During the following 3 days repetitive injections of flumazenil were necessary to counteract recurring depression of respiration and vigilance. Thereafter further application of flumazenil was not necessary.", 
    "9": "Studies were undertaken in mice and rats on the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine on dopaminergic and 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurones in the brain and the neuroprotective action of chlormethiazole. In initial studies, mice were injected with methamphetamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) at 2 hr intervals, to a total of 4 times. This procedure produced a 66% loss of striatal dopamine and a 50% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase activity 3 days later. Chlormethiazole (50 mg/kg, i.p.), given 15 min before each dose of methamphetamine, totally prevented the methamphetamine-induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and partly prevented the loss of dopamine. Phencyclidine (20 mg/kg, i.p.), given in place of chlormethiazole, also prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase. Administration to rats of 4 doses of methamphetamine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) at 3 hr intervals resulted in a 75% loss of striatal dopamine 3 days later and a similar loss of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in cortex and hippocampus. Chlormethiazole (50 mg/kg, i.p.), given 15 min before each injection of methamphetamine, protected against the loss of dopamine and indoleamine content, in the respective regions. Pentobarbital (25 mg/kg, i.p.) also provided substantial protection but diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was without effect. Confirming earlier studies, dizocilpine (1 mg/kg) also provided substantial protection against the methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Preliminary data indicated that chlormethiazole was not neuroprotective because of a hypothermic action. These data therefore demonstrate that chlormethiazole is an effective neuroprotective agent against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity and extend the evidence for the possible value of this drug in preventing neurodegeneration.", 
    "10": "To determine whether a synthetic somatostatin analogue, octreotide, and a cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-364,718, may be beneficial in acute pancreatitis, 33 dogs were assigned to four groups. Each dog underwent laparotomy with injection of autologous bile into the dorsal pancreatic duct. Thirty minutes after the induction of pancreatitis, Group 1 received a subcutaneous injection of octreotide (200 micrograms/kg), Group 2 received an equal volume of the octreotide carrier, Group 3 received an hourly intravenous bolus of L-364,718 (60 micrograms/kg), and Group 4 received an equal volume of the L-364,718 carrier. Hemodynamic profiles, arterial blood gases, plasma glucose, and serum amylase were obtained before laparotomy, at bile injection, and at hourly intervals. The pancreas was removed after 8 hours for gross evaluation, measurement of water content, and histologic examination. A significant decrease in cardiac index and a significant increase in serum amylase and pancreatic edema occurred in all four groups 8 hours after the induction of pancreatitis (P less than 0.05), but there was no statistical difference between any group. Likewise, there was no difference in gross or histologic changes in the pancreas of any group. The somatostatin analogue, octreotide, and the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-364,718, did not ameliorate the effects of severe, bile-induced pancreatitis in dogs.", 
    "11": "Agents that modify thiol groups have been shown to alter ligand binding at a variety of receptor sites. In addition, alkylation of sulfhydryls has been shown to block ion channel conductance. We studied the effects of thiol reagents on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated chloride flux (36Cl-) and [3H]-diazepam binding in mouse brain membrane preparation (microsacs). Incubation of microsacs in the presence of: mercuric chloride (HgCl2), p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (pCMBS), hydroxymercuribenzoate (HMB), n-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or iodoacetic acid (IAA) attenuated GABA-stimulated Cl- uptake. The thiol reagents reduced both maximal stimulation and the potency of GABA to induce Cl- uptake. Thiol reagent treatment decreased the affinity of high-affinity [3H]-muscimol equilibrium binding. Supernatant prepared from microsacs treated with pCMBS stimulated Cl- uptake in the absence of GABA agonist in microsacs unexposed to thiol reagents. The supernatant taken from pCMBS-treated microsacs also stimulated [3H]-diazepam binding. This effect was blocked by the addition of the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline. The concentration of endogenous GABA in supernatant from pCMBS-treated microsacs was sixfold greater than that in supernatant from control microsacs. This increase in levels of endogenous GABA by thiol reagents was due to both an increase in GABA release and a decrease in high-affinity GABA uptake.", 
    "12": "Biochemical studies related with suicidal behavior have mainly dealt with monoaminergic and corticosteroidal measures. We used some of these measures in a study of 61 suicide attempters who, except for occasional doses of benzodiazepines, had been medication free for a mean of 16 days. The monoamine metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were measured in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We found that violent suicide attempters (N = 18) had 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations below the median of all patients, whereas the concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were mainly above the median. We found no significant differences between violent and nonviolent (N = 43) attempters concerning CSF homovanillic acid, 24-hour urinary norepinephrine-epinephrine and cortisol, activity of monoamine oxidase in platelets, or post-dexamethasone plasma cortisol. Four patients completed suicide, and 3 of them had CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations at or below the median. All completed suicides had CSF 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol concentrations above the median. Urinary measures and platelet monoamine oxidase activity of completed suicides were in the higher concentration ranges. Patients who repeated suicidal behavior after the index investigation had low 24-hour urinary cortisol levels more often than those who did not repeat. Because our subgroups of patients are small, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the value of our CSF and urinary biochemical findings predicting suicidal behavior. However, our CSF findings in violent suicide attempters are similar to those observed in other studies.", 
    "13": "To test the possibility that endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) participates in suppression of sham feeding by intraintestinal nutrient infusions, we examined the effect of CCK-receptor antagonists on the suppression of sham feeding by intraintestinally infused oleic acid, maltose or L-phenylalanine (L-Phe). In addition, we monitored amylase activity in the intestinal lumen during some sham feeding experiments and measured plasma CCK in parallel experiments using intestinally infused animals that were not feeding. Suppression of sham feeding by oleic acid or maltose was attenuated by CCK-receptor antagonists, while suppression of sham feeding by L-Phe was not. Oleate infusion increased plasma CCK concentration and luminal amylase activity. Oleate-induced increase in luminal amylase activity was attenuated by a CCK-receptor antagonist. Intraintestinal maltose or L-Phe did not increase plasma CCK concentration or luminal amylase activity, suggesting that they did not release endocrine CCK. These results suggest 1) that endogenous CCK mediates suppression of sham feeding by oleate and maltose but not by L-Phe and 2) that CCK participating in suppression of feeding by intestinal stimuli might not be of endocrine origin.", 
    "14": "The role of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor/chloride channel complex in the development of tolerance to ethanol and cross-tolerance to diazepam and pentobarbital was assessed. Rats given a low (1.8 g/kg) dose of ethanol before daily practice on the moving belt test of motor incoordination, and those given a high daily dose (3.6 g/kg) not paired with practice, showed tolerance to ethanol and cross-tolerance to diazepam and pentobarbital, whereas rats receiving 1.8 g/kg of ethanol after practice did not. Control rats were trained on the moving belt, but received no ethanol treatment. No differences were seen among the treatment groups in the abilities of GABA or ethanol to increase 36Cl uptake into cerebral cortical microsacs. However, diazepam potentiation of GABA-mediated chloride flux was significantly lower in rats receiving daily intoxicated practice, but only if they received an i.p. injection of ethanol 1 hr before sacrifice. The degree of pentobarbital potentiation of the effect of GABA did not correlate with the behavioral cross-tolerance observed. The results indicate that behaviorally augmented cross-tolerance from ethanol to diazepam correlates incompletely with changes on the biochemical level.", 
    "15": "Positron emission tomography (PET) has not only a variety of applications to functional diagnostics using methods of nuclear medicine and for the investigation of pathophysiological processes, it also offers new possibilities for pharmacology. As PET is able to quantitatively record \"from outside\" the regional concentration of a positron emitter in a living primate, the distribution and kinetics of a labelled drug at the site of action can be determined non-invasively. This is always the case if the research substance can be labelled practically carrier-free with a short-lived positron emitter such as 11C (T1/2 = 20 min) or if applicable 18F (T1/2 = 110 min). The quantities applied in this case are so small that pharmacodynamic effects do not occur. Therefore, this method is particularly suitable for measuring in vivo the regional cerebral pharmacokinetics of centrally acting drugs in humans.", 
    "16": "Even though acute poisonings with benzodiazepines are extremely common, less is known of the clinical toxicity of recent derivatives, particularly in children. 1,989 cases involving ethyle loflazepate, flunitrazepam, prazepam or triazolam recorded at the Lyons Poison Center and due to 1 compound and associated with clinical symptoms were selected for study. Children less than 16-y of age accounted for 482 cases. Sleepiness, agitation and ataxia were significantly more frequent in the children. Hypotonia was seldom observed but was indicative of severe poisoning. The dangerous toxic dose of these compounds in children is suggested to be 0.78-0.90 mg ethyle loflazepate/kg, 0.26-0.29 mg flunitrazepam/kg, 7.80-9.00 mg prazepam/kg and 0.06-0.07 mg triazolam/kg. These results are in keeping with the relatively low acute toxicity of the older benzodiazepines.",

Midazolam does not affect the amount of orthogonal arrays of particles on the sarcolemma. 3. Possible mechanisms for the action of midazolam are discussed.", 
    "18": "The effects of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonists flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) and the beta-carboline ZK 93426 were compared in dogs before and after chronic treatment with diazepam or the novel BZ receptor ligand abecarnil (ZK 112119). Abecarnil, a beta-carboline, is thought to act as partial (low efficacy) and/or subtype selective agonist at central BZ receptors. Diazepam and abecarnil were administered at doses which, based on previous experiments on anticonvulsant activity, resulted in about equieffective drug concentrations during treatment. In dogs treated with diazepam, 6 mg/kg/day p.o., for 2 weeks, severe abstinence symptoms, including seizures, were precipitated in all animals by i.v. infusion of the BZ receptor antagonists, differences being found in the type of symptoms caused by flumazenil and ZK 93426. In dogs treated with abecarnil, 4 mg/kg/d s.c., for 6 weeks, only relatively mild abstinence symptoms were precipitated by infusion of flumazenil or ZK 93426, although pharmacologically active plasma concentrations of abecarnil had been maintained throughout the period of treatment. This suggests that BZ receptor ligands which act as partial and/or selective agonists might be more favourable than traditional agonists, such as diazepam, regarding the induction of physical dependence.", 
    "19": "beta-Carboline agonists produced a left shift of the GABA concentration-chloride uptake curve or a reduction in the maximal increase in GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake depending on their concentration. The enhancement of the GABA effect occurs only at lower beta-carboline and GABA concentrations and is smaller for the partial agonist ZK 9126 compared to the full agonist ZK 93423. The opposite effect, inhibition of GABA-stimulated chloride conductance, is observed only at higher concentrations of beta-carboline agonists and GABA. The reduction of the GABA maximal response by the partial agonist ZK 91296 is greater than by the full agonist ZK 93423. The transformation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake data to specific chloride influx (36Cl- uptake per nM of GABA) reveals that the GABA concentration-response curve consists of three parts characterized by differences in the molar effectiveness of GABA relative to the GABA concentration. The molar effectiveness of GABA is a measure of the sensitivity of the GABAA receptor chloride ionophore complex and shows adaptive changes by this complex to increasing concentrations of GABA and/or beta-carboline. We conclude from our data that the change from GABA-sensitive to GABA-insensitive conformation of the GABAA receptor occurs with increasing concentrations of GABA and/or beta-carboline. Both conformations maintain positive heterotropic cooperativity with beta-carboline binding sites, one responsible for positive and the other responsible for negative effects of beta-carboline agonists on chloride uptake.", 
    "20": "To determine whether caffeine antagonizes the decremental effects of triazolam and zopiclone on human performance, oral single doses of 0.250 mg triazolam, 7.5 mg zopiclone, or respective placebos, with and without 300 mg caffeine, were given to parallel groups of student volunteers in two double-blind studies. Objective tests and subjective visual analogue ratings were done at baseline and 30 min. and 90 min. after the intake. In Study I, triazolam produced drowsiness at 30 min. but did not differ from the placebo in other tests. Caffeine induced alerting effects in various tests and differed from triazolam in some (digit substitution, drowsiness, calmness, mental slowness) but not all variables measured. Caffeine and triazolam were interpreted as being antagonists. In Study II, zopiclone impaired digit substitution and flicker fusion, produced exophoria and lowered systolic blood pressure. Caffeine differed from zopiclone in several test functions, but it also differed from caffeine + zopiclone whereas zopiclone differed from caffeine + zopiclone only in two tests (Maddox wing, systolic blood pressure). Thus, zopiclone counteracted the effects of caffeine more easily than caffeine counteracted the decremental effects of zopiclone. We conclude that triazolam may not differ importantly from diazepam as regards their antagonism towards caffeine, whereas further research on the antagonism between zopiclone and caffeine needs to be done.",

It was found that the exposure of mouse spleen lymphocytes in vitro to SS sharply diminished their IP3 level. 3. Diazepam had no effect on lymphocytes IP3 content. 4. The inhibition of phosphatydyloinositol (PI) breakdown was suggested as one of the mechanisms of the physiological SS action.", 
    "22": "Growth and neurodevelopment at 6, 10 and 18 months of age have been studied prospectively and longitudinally in a series of 17 children born to mothers who used benzodiazepines (BZD) in therapeutic doses as their only psychotropic drug throughout pregnancy. The results were compared with a group of 29 children born to mothers without any known use of psychotropic drugs. The BZD-exposed children caught up their low mean birth-weight, at an early stage, whereas the slightly decreased head circumference at birth remained at the same low level. In five infants, a pattern of craniofacial anomalies was found. Deviating neurodevelopmental and clinical symptoms and signs were common. The gross motor development was retarded at 6 and 10 months, but was nearly normal at 18 months. Impaired fine motor functions were found on all follow-up occasions. At 18 months, the most prominent finding was a delayed development of pincer grasp. The BZD-exposed children showed deviations in muscle tone and pattern of movements more frequently than children in the reference group. The study suggests that the use of BZD in therapeutic doses throughout pregnancy can have negative effects on the development of children up to 18 months of age. The long-term hazards cannot be evaluated from these results. A further follow-up at early school age is needed and is in progress.", 
    "23": "Drug-induced depression is classified by the DSM-III-R as an organic mood syndrome of the depressed type. Because drugs have specific pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action, depressive syndromes induced by specific drugs may have characteristic clinical features. An awareness of such features would be valuable for clinical purposes. This review is an attempt to summarize the information on clinical features of drug-induced depressions. The review determined that no unique clinical features have been identified for depressive syndromes associated with most drugs. However, the literature did suggest that depressions associated with oral contraceptive agents may differ significantly from non organic major depressive episodes.", 
    "24": "Drug-induced depression which is classified as DSM-III-R is difficult for clinicians to diagnose because the cause is not easily distinguishable from adjustment disorders or nonorganic mood disorders. This review summarizes the few articles published within 20 years as searched in the Index Medicus about the clinical manifestations of organic mood syndromes from oral contraceptives (OCs), beta blockers, alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs, and other medications. There was a noticeable lack of articles and specific clinical features which would help differentiate causes. Oral contraception may cause depression by inducing hepatic tryptophan oxidase, which may lead to a deficiency of vitamin B6. The most common reason for discontinuing OCs is depression, i.e., there are reports of a rate of 70/1000 woman years during the 1st year of OC use. However, the rate among females examined in a catchment study was similar at 6.6%. There is some indication that depression may be dose related, i.e., low dose is related to the same prevalence as in the control group. A basic requirement of DSM-III-R is severe and persistent depression; OC-related depression does not exhibit sleep or appetite disturbances. The relationship between beta blockers and depression indicates that the prevalence and the nature of the relationship are not consistently confirmed. Depressive episodes (14) reported in 8 studies showed major depression and suicidal thoughts or attempts just after initiation of propranolol and resolution when the drug was discontinued; timing of the symptoms may be the best basis upon which to make a clinical judgement. Alcohol use is usually seen as associated with depression, but the extent to which alcohol induces depression is unknown. Symptoms are transitory and appear during bouts of heavy drinking. Studies on benzodiazepine use and depression are reported to be confounded by other factors. Other depression-causing agents for which information was unavailable are identified as psychostimulants, metoclopramide, H-2 blockers, methyldopa, and steroids.", 
    "25": "Benzodiazepines such as Valium (diazepam) or Versed (midazolam), as used in dental procedures for intravenous sedation, have been a boon to the profession. Yet in the event of sedation problems, no agent exists that consistently reverses all clinical effects of these drugs. This problem does not exist with narcotics, frequently employed in tandem with benzodiazepines, since an effective reversal agent, Narcan (naloxone hydrochloride), exists. It would be advantageous to effectively reverse benzodiazepines in cases of acute emergency with respiratory depression or paradoxical reactions, and to allow quick, full recovery after short dental procedures. None of the drugs currently available for benzodiazepine reversal, such as physostigmine, give consistent clinical results. The purpose of this paper is to discuss Flumazenil, a new specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and its possible use for dental sedation procedures.", 
    "26": "Kinetics and mechanism of action of benzodiazepines are at the base of their proper use in clinical management of anxiety, tension, panics, and insomnia. These important agents have specific receptors within the complex GABA-ergic system: according to the most recent studies, GABAA receptors are more important than GABAB receptors. The author illustrates the management of anxiety states, as well as the treatment of anxiety in children, in old people and of panic attacks. Since the use of benzodiazepines has become excessive, the risk of dependence is discussed as well as possible alternatives (buspirone, antidepressants). Finally, the usefulness of anxiolytic drug treatment is stressed which is one of the pivots of psychopharmacology and the study of the GABA-ergic system.",

Women fell significantly more frequently than men, and 7.5% of falls resulted in fractures.

    "28": "In 1989 New York became the first state to add benzodiazepines to the list of controlled substances requiring a triplicate prescription, allowing the state to track prescribing patterns and target providers, pharmacies, and patients for investigation when misuse is suspected. Studies by the state reporting that regulation has significantly reduced inappropriate prescribing and illicit diversion of benzodiazepines without affecting legitimate prescribing practices are being challenged by other studies showing that patients with legitimate needs for benzodiazepines are being denied them, often after abrupt discontinuation. Several reports indicate a significant increase in the prescribing of benzodiazepine substitutes that are less safe and effective, along with increased overdoses of some substitute drugs. Changes in physicians' legitimate prescribing practices may reflect their fears of the damage to career and peace of mind that follows investigations by regulatory agencies.",

Controlling for confounders (benzodiazepine use, frequent outpatient visits, and frequent use of medications other than beta-blockers) resulted in a null effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.12). The ORs were consistently lower for case patients with a depression diagnosis or electroconvulsive therapy than for cases with only antidepressant use as a marker. These results did not vary by age, sex, race, nursing home status, or use of other selected specific medications.",

    "40": "The antiarrhythmic effects produced by activators of the body's stress-limiting systems were comparatively evaluated in patients with cardiac arrhythmias of ischemic and non-ischemic etiology. Acediprol, gidazepam, and befol were found to be beneficial in ventricular premature contraction when psychoemotional stress was simulated, as evidenced by 24-hour monitoring. The most pronounced protective therapeutical effect of the drugs was observed in patients with arrhythmias of extracoronary origin and in individuals with a marked arrhythmogenic effect of stress. Gidazepam was shown to suppress the provocative arrhythmogenic effect of the stress test.", 
    "41": "Monocyte/macrophages (M/M) are important targets for HIV in the body, and represent the majority of cells infected by the virus in some body compartments such as the central nervous system (CNS). M/M can be different from T-lymphocytes in terms of surface antigens, cell replication and drug metabolism. Thus, we evaluated, in M/M and in T-lymphocytes, the pattern of viral inhibition induced by various anti-HIV drugs, and assessed some of the mechanisms of action related to such antiviral activity. Inhibitors of HIV binding on CD4 receptors have similar activity in M/M and T-lymphocytes, while AZT and other dideoxynucleosides (ddN) are in general more active against HIV in M/M than in T-lymphocytes. This phenomenon can be related to the increased ratio in M/M of ddN-triphosphate/deoxynucleoside-triphosphate, and can at least in part explain the ability of zidovudine and didanosine in improving neurological dysfunctions in AIDS patients. Moreover, the antiviral activity of AZT (but not of other ddN- or HIV-binding inhibitors) is potently enhanced by cytokines like granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in M/M, while anti-HIV activity of TIBO compounds in M/M is not down-modulated by GM-CSF and other cytokines. Finally, non-toxic concentrations of adriamycin, an anticancer drug reported to be active against DNA viruses, can inhibit HIV replication in M/M (but not in T-lymphocytes). Taken together, these results suggest that M/M are selective targets for HIV with peculiarities different from those of T-lymphocytes. Thus, promising anti-HIV compounds should be evaluated both in T-cells and in M/M before reaching clinical trials. This may help in selecting drugs with good chances of being effective in patients with HIV-related disease.", 
    "42": "This study was undertaken to investigate the endocrine stress response during cataract surgery in local anaesthesia (LA) with or without additional sedation with midazolam (Dormicum). 20 patients for cataract surgery in LA were randomly allocated to the midazolam-group (before injection of LA, sedation with single doses of 1 mg midazolam until the patient was sleeping, but awakeable), and to the control-group without sedation. Premedication and LA were standardized. The investigation was performed at 7 measuring points starting at the arrival in the preparation room up to 30 min after surgery. Adrenaline in plasma was significantly lower in the midazolam-group. Intraoperatively, adrenaline increased in the control-group and decreased in the midazolam-group. In time course, noradrenaline in plasma decreased in the midazolam-group, in contrast to the control-group. With respect to ADH, ACTH and cortisol, no significant differences were found in group levels or time course, and concentrations remained within normal range. In contrast to the control-group, mean arterial pressure decreased in the midazolam-group during the course of time. There were no differences in heart rate or arterial oxygen saturation between the two groups. Local anaesthesia and premedication were sufficient to prevent psychic and surgical stressors. The slight sympathoadrenergic response in the control-group was significantly reduced by small doses of midazolam. Thus, a careful supplementation of local anaesthesia with midazolam appears advantageous for patients with cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "43": "The mechanisms by which administration of the H+,K(+)-ATPase inhibitor B 831-78 or intragastric perfusion with NaHCO3 induces plasma gastrin release were studied in the rat. Experiments were performed after a washout of residual intragastric contents in fasted animals provided with chronic gastric fistulae. Acute and chronic administration of B 831-78 elevated plasma gastrin dose-dependently up to 5-6 times above control levels, while the increase was only twofold with intragastric NaHCO3 infusion despite similar neutralization of gastric acidity. The profound hypergastrinaemia induced by the H+,K(+)-ATPase inhibitor, after both acute and chronic treatment, was completely prevented or reversed by intragastric perfusion with physiological amounts of acid (0.15 N HCl, 2.5 ml/h). The hypergastrinaemia was, however, largely resistant to high doses of atropine (4.3 mumol/kg) and of the M1 selective muscarinic antagonist telenzepine (10 mumol/kg). In contrast, the modest increase in plasma gastrin induced by gastric perfusion with NaHCO3 was completely suppressed by the high atropine dose and was attenuated by small doses of atropine or telenzepine (0.01 mumol/kg and 1 mumol/kg). These results demonstrate that, in the rat, blockade of the H+,K(+)-ATPase can potently induce gastrin release in the absence of a meal. Moreover, they suggest that interruption of the negative feedback between acid and gastrin release is the main mechanism through which this class of drugs releases gastrin in the rat. Since a similar degree of gastrin release cannot be achieved by alkalinization of gastric contents, additional hormonal or neural regulatory factors may contribute to the drug-induced hypergastrinaemia.", 
    "44": "Growth hormone (GH), blood pressure, and pulse rate responses to clonidine (100 micrograms IV) were studied three times during the first week of alcohol withdrawal in 19 alcohol-dependent patients. Fifteen healthy men were used as controls. The results suggest reduced sensitivity of the alpha-2-adrenoceptors involved in GH secretion for at least 1 week after the end of alcohol intake. In contrast, very short-lasting subsensitivity was found in the alpha-2-adrenoceptors regulating blood pressure.", 
    "45": "The effects of diazepam (DZ) infusions on changes in adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) are a source of debate. In this study, 66 healthy young adult men were evaluated for changes in plasma ACTH after intravenous infusions with placebo, 0.12 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg of DZ. After the higher DZ dose, 85% of the subjects demonstrated a decrease in ACTH of 20% or more, with the nadir occurring between 30 and 60 min postinfusion and values returning to baseline levels by 180 min. These results support the conclusion that at the clinically relevant doses used here, DZ infusions are associated with a significant decrease in ACTH.", 
    "46": "A place conditioning situation was used to assess the putative affective properties of benzodiazepine receptor ligands in the rat. The benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist Ro 16-6028 induced a conditioned place preference, suggesting that this compound has rewarding properties. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 induced neither place preference nor aversion, but prevented the place preference induced by Ro 16-6028, suggesting that the rewarding effects of Ro 16-6028 are due to its action on the benzodiazepine receptor. The benzodiazepine receptor full agonist diazepam did not induce a conditioned place preference in our hands, in contrast with previous studies. The sensitivity of place conditioning with benzodiazepine ligands to situational factors, such as the existence of a preconditioning preference, is discussed.", 
    "47": "When the benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM (6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester) occupies the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABAA receptor complex, the inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is attenuated. DMCM acted as an unconditional stimulus for one response associated with fear or anxiety, analgesia, as indicated by a dose-dependent (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) suppression of rats' responses to a formalin injection. This was accompanied by other fearlike responses (defecation and urination). The opioid antagonist naltrexone (1.75-14 mg/kg) did not affect these behaviors. Environmental cues associated with DMCM provoked analgesia and defecation in the absence of the drug. The conditional analgesia was reversed by naltrexone (7 mg/kg). DMCM functions as an unconditional fear stimulus by eliciting fear-related behaviors and conditioning those responses to neutral stimuli. The neural circuitry underlying fear conditioning appears to involve tonically inhibitory GABAergic synapses.", 
    "48": "The clinical characteristics of a series of patients who developed physical dependence to triazolam has not previously been described. We report five cases of high-dose triazolam abuse in which the daily dosage ranged from 5 to 15 mg (100-300 mg diazepam equivalent) and the duration of use ranged from 3 months to 5 years. Physical dependence usually occurs in the context of a history of alcohol or other drug abuse, a history of panic attacks or anxiety disorder, substitution of triazolam for a longer-acting benzodiazepine, or inappropriate use of triazolam as an anxiolytic agent given as multiple daily doses. A rational approach to the pharmacotherapy of triazolam withdrawal is described. Treatment to replace the triazolam with a long half-life CNS depressant and strategies for this pharmacologic therapy are discussed. The abuse liability of triazolam may be no greater and is most likely less than that of some other benzodiazepines.", 
    "49": "After acute administration of low doses, alprazolam displays unusual behavioral and neurochemical characteristics. To determine whether chronic low-dose alprazolam has unique effects, we treated mice for 1-14 days with alprazolam 0.2 mg/kg per day and evaluated open-field activity, benzodiazepine receptor binding, t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding, and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake. Open-field activity in treated mice was similar to that of control mice at each timepoint during alprazolam administration. Similarly, benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo was unchanged in five brain regions. Benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo was unchanged in five brain regions. Benzodiazepine binding in vitro in the cortex was unaffected by alprazolam treatment, as was t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in the cortex. However, muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake was increased after 2 and 4 days of alprazolam compared with results after 1, 7, and 14 days. These results are consistent with prior reports of unusual effects of low-dose alprazolam and extend these findings to chronic administration.",

    "51": "We measured the density of two benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor subtypes in neurosurgically obtained hippocampal tissue from the seizure focus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) showing mesial temporal sclerosis, the most common pathologic finding in TLE. We performed quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography with [125I]Ro 16-0154, a probe for the central-type BZ receptor and with [3H]PK 11195, a probe for the peripheral-type BZ receptor. In comparison with autopsy and neurosurgical control groups, patients with mesial temporal sclerosis had regionally selective decreased central-type and increased peripheral-type BZ receptors. These changes paralleled regional losses of neurons and proliferation of glia. Decreases of the inhibitory central-type BZ receptor may be a component of the enhanced excitability of the seizure focus and also may allow localization of the focus by in vivo neuroreceptor imaging. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of two TLE patients with [123I]Ro 16-0154 suggests that this technique may provide a more sensitive means of localizing the seizure focus than current imaging methods relying on changes in blood flow or glucose metabolism.", 
    "52": "Chronic administration of benzodiazepine active at the tau-aminobutyric acidA receptor (\"central\" benzodiazepine sites) is associated with behavioral tolerance and receptor downregulation. Recent reports indicate possible interactions between central sites and benzodiazepines active at \"peripheral-type\" sites located primarily on non-neuronal cells. To evaluate these interactions during chronic administration, we treated mice with lorazepam for 1 to 14 days alone or in combination with the peripheral-type site ligand PK11195 [N-methyl-N-(methyl-1-propyl)chloro-2-phenyl-1-isoquinoline-3-carboxamid e]. Lorazepam was associated with tolerance at 7 days, but tolerance was not observed during concurrent administration of PK11195. Lorazepam was also associated with benzodiazepine receptor down-regulation in cortex and hippocampus at 7 days. With concurrent administration of PK11195, this effect remained in cortex but was absent in hippocampus. tau-Aminobutyric acid-dependent chloride uptake was reduced in both cortex and hippocampus with lorazepam, but not with concurrent lorazepam and PK11195. PK11195 administration alone did not affect behavior or neurochemical parameters, or did it alter brain lorazepam concentrations. These data indicate that concurrent PK11195 administration attenuates behavioral and neurochemical effects of chronic lorazepam administration.", 
    "53": "Acute intoxicating doses of ethanol-producing blood alcohol levels of 120-200 mg% increase paired-pulse (PP) inhibition in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats suggesting that ethanol increases recurrent inhibitory processes (Wiesner, J.B., and S.J. Henriksen (1987) Ethanol enhances recurrent inhibition in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Neurosci. Lett. 79:169-173). To further understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, the authors studied the effects of the benzodiazepine (BZ), chlordiazepoxide, and acute intoxicating levels of ethanol on extracellular field potential recordings and single-unit activity in the dentate gyrus and area CA1 of the hippocampus. In the dentate, ethanol had no effect on population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP) amplitudes or slopes; decreased population spike (PS) amplitudes (25%); increased PP inhibition; decreased dentate granule cell (DGC) spontaneous activity (58%); had no effect on putative interneuron spontaneous activity; and markedly increased post field potential-evoked interneuron discharges (IDs, 218%). Chlordiazepoxide had no effect on pEPSP amplitudes or slopes or PS amplitudes; increased PP inhibition; decreased DGC (62%) and interneuron (72%) spontaneous activity; and markedly decreased IDs (89%). In CA1, ethanol had no effect on pEPSP amplitudes or slopes; decreased PS amplitudes (26%); had no effect on PP responses; decreased pyramidal cell (PC) spontaneous activity (39%); had no effect on interneuron spontaneous activity; and markedly increased IDs (97%). Chlordiazepoxide had no effect on pEPSP amplitudes or slopes or PS amplitudes; had no effect on PP responses; decreased PC spontaneous activity (41%); and had no effect on interneuron spontaneous activity or IDs. The results suggest that the BZs decrease principal cell excitability by postsynaptic facilitation of inhibitory processes, whereas ethanol decreases principal cell excitability indirectly by increasing the excitability of inhibitory interneurons.", 
    "54": "The serum valproate (VPA) concentration and the clinical effects of polytherapy with other antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital (PB), clonazepam (CZP), diazepam (DZ), clobazam (CLO), ethosuximide (ESX) were estimated. VPA serum levels were reduced when this drug was combined with phenobarbital. Clobazam given together with valproate led to an increase in the serum concentration of the former drug. VPA serum levels were without significant changes when the drug was combined with either ethosuximide or 1-4-benzodiazepines. The best therapeutical effects were found after polytherapy sodium valproate with ethosuximide and clobazam in primary generalized seizures.", 
    "55": "The effects of gastrin on cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in single, isolated rat gastric parietal cells were investigated using the fluorescent probe Fura-2 and digital image analysis. [Ca2+]i was increased by gastrin (100 nM) in approximately 30% of the parietal cells, which were identified by using either the fluorescent probe acridine orange or a parietal cell-specific monoclonal antibody. In the dominant pattern observed, [Ca2+]i was elevated 50-150% and returned within 1-2 min to a value 30-60% over the basal, which was sustained until withdrawal of the stimulant or addition of the gastrin inhibitor L-365,260 (1 microM). The second, but not the first phase, was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The results indicate the existence of functional gastrin receptors in a subpopulation of rat parietal cells.", 
    "56": "[3H]Ro 15-4513, a negative modulator at the benzodiazepine receptor, binds with high affinity to all known benzodiazepine binding sites associated with the GABAA receptors. The present experiments surveyed a number of benzodiazepine receptor ligands with different chemical structures and different intrinsic pharmacological profiles for their ability to displace [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in rat cerebellar membranes. The latter have been shown to possess two types of binding sites, one sensitive to positive modulators such as diazepam and the other insensitive to them (diazepam-insensitive). Whereas the full positive modulators from the benzodiazepine, beta-carboline, and quinoline classes did not displace binding at the diazepam-insensitive sites, the partial positive modulators' affinities for these sites varied much more, some being very potent and others having no affinity at all. All the neutral antagonists tested displaced binding at both types of binding sites, while some of the negative modulators were apparently not potent at the diazepam-insensitive sites. In an alcohol-sensitive rat line (ANT, alcohol non-tolerant), with an enhanced affinity for positive modulators at the diazepam-insensitive sites, these sites also exhibited enhanced affinity for some of the partial positive and negative modulators. The results suggest that the cerebellar diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites have unique substrate specificity. It remains to be established which behaviours are affected by activation or inhibition of these receptors that are characterized by their insensitivity to benzodiazepine-positive modulators.", 
    "57": "The ability of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists, MK-329 and L-365,260, to selectively inhibit 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK8 binding to ligated rat vagus nerve in vitro was examined at concentrations ranging from 10(-10) M to 10(-6) M. Both antagonists inhibited binding to CCK binding sites accumulating proximal to ligatures on the cervical vagus. Incubation of nerve sections in the presence of both antagonists produced an additive effect, indicating that both CCK-A and CCK-B binding sites are transported towards the periphery. In contrast, CCK binding sites accumulating distal to the ligature possessed the pharmacological characteristics of the CCK-B receptor sub-type only.", 
    "58": "The effects of manipulation of adrenal steroids by adrenalectomy (ADX) or stress on GABAA receptor function were characterized in long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice. 36Chloride flux was not altered in either line of mouse after ADX; however, exposure to a behavioral stressor resulted in a highly significant inhibition of ion channel activity measured in cortical membranes from both LS and SS mice. Adrenalectomy also had no effect on [3H]FNZ binding; whereas exposure to stress differentially altered benzodiazepine binding in LS and SS mice. In LS cortex both Bmax and Kd values increased, whereas in SS cerebellum, Bmax and Kd values were decreased after stress. In SS mice ADX did not affect GABA-enhancement of [3H]FNZ binding. In LS mice, however, ADX resulted in a potentiation of GABA-enhanced [3H]FNZ binding in cortex and an inhibition of enhancement in cerebellum. Corticosterone (CCS) replacement in ADX-LS mice returned enhancement values to those of sham-operated mice, indicating a role for basal levels of CCS in maintaining normal receptor coupling function in this line of mouse. These results suggest that GABAA receptor sensitivity is more labile under stressful conditions. Differential receptor responses to adrenal manipulation between LS and SS mice may be due to genetic variation in GABAA receptor subunit combinations in these lines of mice.",

    "60": "A series of novel nonpeptide cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) antagonists have been synthesized. Designed on the basis of the structural homology between lorglumide and L-364,718, as investigated with molecular modeling, these compounds constitute a link between the N-acylglutamic acid and 3-amino-5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one derived antagonists. The prepared compounds were tested in vitro as antagonists of the binding of [3H]-(+/-)-L-364,718 and [3H]-CCK-8(S) to rat pancreas and guinea pig brain membranes, respectively. All compounds proved to be selective for the (peripheral) CCK-A receptor, the most potent analogue, 6, having a Ki value of 90 nM. The structure-activity profile of the series of hybrid compounds relates closest to that of the N-acylglutamic acid derived antagonists.", 
    "61": "Neurotensin is an endogenous neuropeptide that produces many CNS effects that are similar to the behavioral and physiological alterations seen after administration of antipsychotic drugs to laboratory animals. As previously reported, sub-chronic (3 week) and acute (single injection) treatment with haloperidol (1 mg/kg), a clinically effective antipsychotic drug increases neurotensin concentrations in the nucleus accumbens and the caudate nucleus. In contrast, a tricyclic antidepressant (desipramine, 10 mg/kg), an anxiolytic (chlordiazepoxide, 25 mg/kg) and a histamine H1 receptor antagonist (diphenhydramine, 20 mg/kg) did not alter neurotensin concentrations in these brain regions after sub-chronic or acute treatment. These data demonstrate pharmacologic specificity to the antipsychotic drug-induced increases in regional brain neurotensin concentrations, and support the hypothesis that these changes may contribute to the clinical efficacy of these drugs.", 
    "62": "Phenobarbitone-pretreated male Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes were used to examine C3-hydroxylation and N-dealkylation of four clinically important benzodiazepines: diazepam (DZP), prazepam (PZP), pinazepam (PIN) and halazepam (HZP). These substrates differ only in the nature of the N-substituent of the B ring and N-desmethyldiazepam (DMD) is the N-dealkylation product in each case. C3-Hydroxylation was accordingly also studied with DMD as substrate. All monooxygenations were studied with substrates at a concentration of 10 microM, in the absence of solubilizing agents, and under conditions where the production of secondary metabolites was minimized. A 20-fold variation in the rate of C3-hydroxylation was recorded across the five substrates with HZP showing the highest rate and DMD showing the lowest rate. An almost equally large range of variation was shown for the N-dealkylation reaction, with PZP undergoing this biotransformation more than 17 times faster than DZP. Log P values (a measure of lipophilicity) for the five substrates were determined using an HPLC method and a remarkable lack of correspondence between this substrate parameter and either of the monooxygenations was noted. This suggests that multiple substrate determinants govern the relative rates of these monooxygenations. It was, however, notable that the additive rate of metabolism of these substrates by both monooxygenase routes did show an excellent correlation with substrate lipophilicity.", 
    "63": "Muscarinic receptors of resistance vessels (submucosal arterioles, outside diameter 50-75 microns) from the guinea-pig small intestine were investigated in vitro using a computer-assisted videomicroscopy system (Diamtrak). The muscarinic receptor which mediates vasodilation of precontracted [U-46619 (300 nM) or (-)-noradrenaline (10 microM)] arterioles was characterized with several muscarinic agonists and subtype-selective antagonists. The following agonists all produced equivalent maximum vasodilation (given in rank order of potency): acetylcholine = arecaidine propargyl ester (APE) greater than oxotremorine = (+/-)-muscarine = (+/-)-methacholine greater than carbachol greater than 4-[[N-(4-chlorophenyl)carbamoyl]oxy]-2-butynyltrimethylammonium iodide (4-Cl-McN-A-343). 4-[[N-(3-Chlorophenyl)-carbamoyl]oxy]-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343) and N-ethyl-guvacine propargyl ester (NEN-APE) produced minimal or no arteriolar vasodilation. The muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine, (+-)-5,11-dihydro-11-[[[2-[2-((dipropylamino)methyl)-1-piperidinyl] ethyl]amino]-carbonyl]-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)-benzodiazepin-6-one (AF-DX 384), 11-[[4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)-benzodiazepin-6-one (AQ-RA 741), p-fluorohexahydro-sila-difenidol (p-F-HHSiD), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and (R)- and (S)-hexahydro-difenidol [(R)-HHD, (S)-HHD] shifted the muscarine, methacholine or carbachol dose-response curve to the right in a competitive manner. Schild analysis of the data yielded pA2 values for pirenzepine (6.74/6.9), AF-DX 384 (6.72), AQ-RA 741 (6.58), p-F-HHSiD (7.53/7.57), 4-DAMP (9.06), (R)-HHD (7.88/8.32) and (S)-HHD (5.52/5.88). Thus, it can be concluded that submucosal arterioles possess only the M3 functional muscarinic receptor, the activation of which causes blood vessel dilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "The effects of the cholecystokinin A (CCKA) receptor antagonist, L-364,718, and the CCKB receptor antagonist, L-365,260, on CCK-8-stimulated insulin secretion were studied in vivo in the mouse. It was found that CCK-8-stimulated insulin secretion was suppressed by L-364,718 at a low dose level (0.078 mumol/kg). In contrast, L-365,260 caused a partial inhibition of CCK-8-stimulated insulin release only at the high dose level (24 mumol/kg). It is concluded that the CCK-8-stimulated insulin release in vivo is mediated by CCK receptors of the CCKA subtype.", 
    "65": "Studies of central benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain in vivo are now possible using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]flumazenil. With the aim of measuring Bmax and Kd in brain regions, we used a two-injection [11C]flumazenil (at high and low specific radioactivity, respectively) pseudo-equilibrium paradigm to evaluate, in seven unmedicated healthy volunteers, the relative merits of three 'reference' structures (pons, hemispheric white matter and corpus callosum) in which the free radioligand concentration in brain tissue was estimated 15-40 min after i.v. injection of the radioligand. By means of high-resolution PET, the Bmax and Kd were calculated for each subject in 18 gray matter structures, based on a two-point Scatchard plot. We found that the use of the corpus callosum as reference often resulted in spurious Bmax and Kd values. The pons was the best reference structure because it provided satisfactory Bmax values (closest to in vitro data) and most consistent Kd values, and was the region easiest to sample on PET images. The pattern of regional Bmax was consistent with that expected from in vitro studies, with values highest in the cerebral cortex, intermediate in the cerebellum, and lowest in the striatum and the thalamus. The Kd values were uniform among regions and were consistent with earlier in vitro and in vivo data. This work documents the feasibility of estimating Bmax and Kd of central benzodiazepine receptors in multiple brain regions for clinical research.", 
    "66": "Several studies have indicated that patients with panic attacks have a higher rate of suicide attempts as well as deaths from suicide. Additionally, several investigators have presented case reports of individuals manifesting suicidal and violent behaviors directly and temporally associated with panic attacks. We report on four additional cases and suggest that these findings may explain, in part, the increased rate of suicidal behavior among patients with panic attacks found by some investigators. Furthermore, these case reports offer preliminary evidence that the relationship between violent behavior and the panic state may be clinically significant and deserving of further elucidation.", 
    "67": "The most common treatment for urine spraying and marking in cats has been administration of long-acting progestins. Treatment with diazepam has recently been gaining favor, particularly because of reported adverse effects of progestins. Results of a clinical trial involving 20 cats indicated that diazepam was effective in eliminating or markedly reducing spraying in 11 (55%) of them. However, most cats required continuous treatment, or at least intermittent treatment, when spraying recurred. The physiologic and behavioral dependency of cats on diazepam, which presumably develops over the course of administration, may contribute to the tendency for spraying to recur once diazepam treatment is discontinued. Using data from previously published findings on progestin administration, plus additional cases, it was documented that a significantly (P less than 0.05) higher percentage of males than females responded favorably. Although the number of cases was not sufficient for a statistical comparison of diazepam vs progestin treatment with regard to male vs female, possible gender difference in the effectiveness of diazepam was not indicated.", 
    "68": "Female C3H/He mice carrying the mammary tumor virus (MTV) were monitored for mammary tumor incidence and latent periods while subjected to a daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of placebo or alprazolam (1 mg/kg per day). Although all of the mice were potential candidates for MTV-induced breast cancer, those injected with alprazolam were partially protected against adverse effects of stress induced by the daily administration of placebo.", 
    "69": "A two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to assay the enantiomers of a major phenytoin metabolite, p-hydroxyphenylphenylhydantoin (p-HPPH). Racemic p-HPPH was first separated from phenytoin and other interfering peaks by a reversed-phase column and monitored by an ultraviolet detector. At the retention time of p-HPPH, the racemic p-HPPH peak was automatically transferred to a chiral ligand-exchange column to separate R-p-HPPH and S-p-HPPH by a time-programmed column-switching valve. The ratio of enantiomers was measured by a second ultraviolet detector. The method can be used to assay R- and S-p-HPPH enantiomers with reasonable sensitivity and reproducibility. By using this method, the stereoselectivity of enzyme induction and inhibition of phenytoin metabolism was investigated. Male rats were treated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, acetone, Aroclor 1254, pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, dexamethasone and isosafrole. Microsomes were prepared from the rat liver and phenytoin hydroxylation was measured. Pretreatment with phenobarbital, pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile or acetone induced phenytoin metabolism non-stereoselectively. Pretreatment with dexamethasone decreased R-p-HPPH formation without affecting the formation of S-p-HPPH. Liver microsomes from female rats showed a higher S-p-HPPH formation, whereas R-p-HPPH formation remained the same. Various inhibitors were added to inhibit phenytoin metabolism by control microsomes. Sulphaphenazole, ketoconazole, 4,4-di(p-methoxyphenyl)hydantoin, cimetidine and diazepam inhibited the formation of R- and S-p-HPPH. Quinidine, tolbutamide and mephenytoin showed no significant inhibitory activity. None of these inhibitors showed stereoselectivity.", 
    "70": "Two studies were conducted to assess the effects of buspirone and alprazolam on a three-choice working memory water escape task. Both studies involved giving rats three daily trials, each trial consisting of an information run during which guillotine doors forced the rats to swim into the correct escape alley and a test run during which the rats could enter any of the three alleys but escape only on entering the same alley to which they had been forced on the information run. In the first experiment, rats were trained to a 70% correct choice criterion with 5-min interrun intervals and then tested for performance with 5, 20, 20 with distraction, and 60-min interrun intervals. In the second experiment, rats in each of the drug groups were tested after receiving one of three different doses of their respective drug. Results suggest that 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg buspirone but not 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg alprazolam impaired performance of rats on a three-choice working memory water escape task.", 
    "71": "1. Male rats were injected with either saline, diazepam, MK-801, or diazepam plus MK-801. 2. In previous work with phencyclidine (PCP), diazepam significantly reduced the increase in homovanillic acid (HVA) in olfactory tubercle and prefrontal cortex. 3. Diazepam also lowered the HVA increase following MK-801 in caudate, olfactory tubercle, and prefrontal cortex. 4. Benzodiazepine receptors may modify dopaminergic function at PCP receptors that affect dopamine neurotransmission.", 
    "72": "In this study the prescription of drugs in an outpatients geriatric population was evaluated in terms of age and body weight.", 
    "73": "From a wide survey carried out on 500 geriatric outpatients, all the prescriptions corresponding to H-2 antagonists, digoxin, theophylline, bromazepam, diazepam, lorazepam and triazolam were analyzed. The patients studied were of 60 or more years of age. For each drug patients were stratified into groups according to intervals of body weight with mean age of the patient being determined in each of the intervals as well as the doses received in mg/kg.", 
    "74": "Two hundred eighty prescriptions were analyzed with 12% corresponding to the H-2 antagonists, 29% to digoxin, 23% to theophylline and 35% to benzodiazepines. There was no significant correlation between age and the doses received. In general, the lowest body weight corresponded with a higher mean age and a marked increase in the mean dose of cimetidine, ranitidine, theophylline, bromazepam, lorazepam, and triazolam administered. There was a tendency to an adjustment in the doses of digoxin in the most elderly patients.", 
    "75": "The data found concerning the prescription of drugs to a geriatric outpatients population indicate that in elderly patients adjustments are not made in the doses of drugs administered according to the age and body weight of the patient. Low body weight of the elderly is a overdosage risk factor.", 
    "76": "We have recently found that the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, (+)MK-801 and ketamine, block the development of rapid tolerance to ethanol. In the present report we show that they also block rapid cross-tolerance from chlordiazepoxide to ethanol as well as ethanol to chlordiazepoxide. However, NMDA antagonists fail to block the development of rapid tolerance to chlordiazepoxide. Our results suggest that NMDA antagonists may affect not only the acquisition of rapid tolerance or cross-tolerance to sedatives but also the ability to express that tolerance or cross-tolerance, depending on the drugs used. It is also possible that the phenomena of rapid tolerance and rapid cross-tolerance have basic differences not previously reported in the literature.", 
    "77": "1. The influence of some GABAergic agents on tonic seizures elicited by chloroquine was investigated in mice. 2. Chloroquine (45-100 mg/kg) elicited seizures in mice in a dose related manner. 3. Muscimol (1-2 mg/kg), DABA (8-16 mg/kg) and baclofen (4-16 mg/kg) profoundly delayed the onset of chloroquine (65 mg/kg)-induced seizures. The incidence of the seizures was also significantly reduced by muscimol (1-2 mg/kg), DABA (8 mg/kg) and baclofen (4-8 mg/kg). 4. AOAA (10 mg/kg) profoundly reduced the proportion of mice that convulsed while AOAA (20 mg/kg) completely protected mice against chloroquine (65 mg/kg)-induced seizures. 5. Bicuculline (5 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (0.5-1 mg/kg) significantly potentiated chloroquine (50 mg/kg)-induced seizures. The onset of seizures and the number of mice that convulsed were shortened and increased respectively. The onset of chloroquine (65 mg/kg)-elicited seizures was also profoundly shortened. Bicuculline (5 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (0.5 mg/kg) effectively antagonised the protective effects of muscimol (2 mg/kg), AOAA (10 mg/kg) and DABA (8 mg/kg) against chloroquine (65 mg/kg)-elicited seizures. 6. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) and phenobarbitone (20 mg/kg) significantly antagonised chloroquine (65 mg/kg) seizures. The onset of seizures was significantly delayed by both diazepam (0.25-1 mg/kg) and phenobarbitone (10-20 mg/kg). 7. These data suggest that enhancement and inhibition of GABAergic neurotransmission respectively attenuate and potentiate chloroquine seizures in mice.", 
    "78": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) and benzodiazepine receptor binding characteristics were analyzed in the brain tissue samples from 19 suicide victims and 23 control cases. In the frontal cortex, significantly higher apparent number of CCK receptors and affinity constants were found in the series of suicide victims. These differences between suicides and controls were present in similar proportions when the suicide cases with depressive syndrome or violent or non-violent means of self-killing were compared to matched controls. However, when the samples were split into subgroups consisting of persons either below or over the age of 60 years, significant differences in the CCK receptor characteristics in the frontal cortex were observed only between younger suicides and controls. Furthermore, the younger suicide victims had a higher density of CCK receptors in the cingulate cortex, whereas in older suicides the value was lower as compared to age-matched controls. No difference in benzodiazepine receptor binding was found between control and suicide groups. The results of this investigation suggest that CCK-ergic neurotransmission is linked to self-destructive behaviour, probably through its impact on anxiety and adaptational deficits.", 
    "79": "Panic disorder (PD) was first delineated as a separate diagnostic entity 25 years ago. It is a prevalent disorder that responds well to pharmacological interventions, most notably to antidepressants and benzodiazepines. PD and other psychiatric disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and major depression, overlap clinically, but it is unresolved whether they also overlap biologically. Finally, the pathogenesis of PD is still unclear. Theories linking panic to increased sensitivity to CO2 or serotonin are preliminary, while alpha 2-adrenergic dysregulation in panic is still unproven. However, the development of new, selective, receptor agonists and antagonists in combination with imaging techniques may produce some of the answers to the questions raised since.", 
    "80": "In a double blind clinical trial 100 adult patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. In group I after spinal block slow injection of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) was followed by placebo (0.5 mg/kg as bolus and 0.5 mg/kg/hour in infusion). In group II patients, after spinal block slow injection of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) was followed by injection of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg as bolus and 0.5 mg/kg/hour as infusion). Low dose of ketamine in combination with diazepam significantly improves quality of anaesthesia, gives better cardiovascular stability without significant increase in complication rate and significantly improves patients' acceptance for the technique.", 
    "81": "Synthetic benzodiazepines produce an anterograde amnesia, which can be reversed by selective benzodiazepine antagonists or inverse agonists. It has therefore been suggested that the memory-enhancing effects of the antagonists are due to antagonism of an endogenous \"benzodiazepine-like\" endocoid. If the memory-enhancing effects of the benzodiazepine antagonists are determined predominantly by the antagonism of such endogenous benzodiazepine-ligands, then it could be hypothesized that administration of an inverse agonist, which produces effects functionally opposite to those of benzodiazepine agonists, may also mimic the effects of benzodiazepine antagonists but not produce effects greater than those of the pure antagonists. The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate the memory-enhancing effects of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, ethyl-8-amido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5a] [1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-4513) in young HSD:(ICR)BR mice and to compare these effects with those of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. Pretraining injections of flumazenil and Ro 15-4513 (2.5 and 10.0 mg/kg) enhanced equally, both the acquisition and the retention of a task for 1 week requiring mice to discriminate the correct arm of a T-maze, to avoid a mild electric shock. Pretreatment with Ro 15-4513 also dose-dependently protected the animals from experimental amnesia, induced by the cholinergic receptor antagonist, scopolamine in a second model of memory, in which mice were required to passively avoid a dark chamber after shock. In contrast, Ro 15-4513, injected prior to daily active avoidance sessions, failed to significantly improve either the acquisition or retention performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "Chlordiazepoxide (21.5 mg/l; 5 mg/kg daily), buspirone (12.8 g/l; 3.4 mg/kg daily) and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, BRL 46470, (40 micrograms/l; 10 micrograms/kg daily) were each given in the drinking fluid for 12-14 days to adult male CD1 mice. Controls received tap water. Effects of the treatments on behaviour during 5 min social encounters with untreated partners were examined by ethological procedures in an aversive and less aversive situation, an unfamiliar neutral cage and the home cage. In the neutral cage all compounds increased the occurrence of the social act, \"nose\" and enhanced digging of the unfamiliar sawdust, at the expense of exploration. In the home cage, all compounds increased social investigation and reduced non-social activity. The drug BRL 46470 evoked more marked effects on behaviour than did buspirone or chlordiazepoxide and in the neutral cage it enhanced some acts of aggression. These results show that all compounds increased reactivity to normal social and environmental stimuli, in addition to their anxiolytic profile of behavioural effects.", 
    "83": "The characteristics and treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia are reviewed. Risk factors for preeclampsia include (1) nulliparity, (2) a mother or sister(s) with a history of the disorder, (3) essential hypertension or renal disease, or (4) a twin or molar pregnancy. Preeclampsia is diagnosed when the systolic blood pressure (BP) increases by 30 mm Hg or the diastolic BP increases by 15 mm Hg after the 20th week of gestation and the BP rise is accompanied by edema, proteinuria, or both. Severe preeclampsia is diagnosed when the BP reaches or exceeds 160 mm Hg systolic or 110 mm Hg diastolic after bed rest. Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures (in the preeclamptic patient) that cannot be attributed to other causes; it occurs in about 0.2% of preeclamptic patients. Magnesium sulfate (in the injectable, hydrated form) is the agent used most often for seizure prophylaxis in the preeclamptic patient in the United States. It is also used widely to control seizures once they develop. In the United States, diazepam is used to supplement magnesium sulfate if necessary to control seizures, but its use is not routine. Among antihypertensive agents, i.v. hydralazine is preferred in this country to control blood pressure in the severely preeclamptic or eclamptic patient. Several studies provide promising evidence that low-dose aspirin (60-150 mg daily beginning at 28-30 weeks of gestation) prevents preeclampsia in women who are at risk for its development. Until additional comparative studies are completed, magnesium sulfate and hydralazine will remain the standard of care for the treatment of preeclampsia in the United States.", 
    "84": "The psychotropic effects of \"Hokkai-Kisso\", i.e. roots of Japanese valerian, were compared with those of diazepam and imipramine. Both 30% EtOH extract of valerian root (11.2 g/kg) and diazepam (3 mg/kg) significantly prolonged hexobarbital-induced sleep in mice. Spontaneous ambulation and rearing during an open field test were significantly decreased by valerian extract (11.2 g/kg), but kessyl glycol diacetate (KGD, 400 mg/kg) and diazepam (3 mg/kg) significantly increased ambulation. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased approach-avoidance conflict in mice in a water-lick conflict test, but valerian extract and KGD did not. By contrast, valerian extract (4.1 g/kg) and imipramine (20 mg/kg) significantly inhibited immobility induced by a forced swimming test in rats, but did not increase spontaneous motor activity during an open field test just before the forced swimming test. In addition, valerian extract and imipramine significantly reversed reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice. These results indicate that valerian extract acts on the central nervous system and may be an antidepressant.", 
    "85": "Flumazenil is a new drug indicated for the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines mediated at the benzodiazepine-receptor site. Worldwide sources to date have disclosed 43 cases of seizures related, at least temporally, to the intravenous administration of flumazenil. There was no apparent relationship between the dose of flumazenil and the development of seizures, which occurred at doses ranging from 0.2 to 10.0 mg. The seizures were not considered to be a toxic effect of flumazenil, but many of them probably were due to an unmasking of the anticonvulsant effect of the previously used benzodiazepine or to a severe benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome. Eighteen (42%) of the patients had ingested overdoses of cyclic antidepressants, which were considered responsible for the seizures. In addition to patients with concurrent cyclic antidepressant poisoning, high-risk populations include patients who have been treated with benzodiazepines for a seizure disorder or an acute convulsive episode, patients with concurrent major sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal, patients who have recently been treated with repeated doses of parenteral benzodiazepines, and overdose patients with myoclonic jerking or seizure activity before flumazenil administration. To minimize the likelihood of a seizure, it is recommended that flumazenil not be administered to patients who have used benzodiazepines for the treatment of seizure disorders or to patients who have ingested drugs (eg, cyclic antidepressants, cocaine, lithium, methylxanthines, isoniazid, propoxyphene, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, buproprion HCl, and cyclosporine) that place them at risk for the development of seizures.", 
    "86": "Benzodiazepine drugs have been shown to suppress respiratory function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We designed a placebo-controlled crossover study to compare the effects of a new benzodiazepine, estazolam ('ProSom'), with those of flurazepam ('Dalmane') on cardiopulmonary function in COPD patients. 29 patients completed all treatment phases (estazolam 2 mg, flurazepam 30 mg or placebo). Respiratory and cardiovascular function were assessed in awake patients on days 1 and 5 (acute and cumulative effects). Eight patients were also assessed during sleep in each period. The effects of estazolam and flurazepam on ventilatory response to CO2 and mouth occlusion pressure were no different from those of placebo. However, acute administration of flurazepam lowered tidal volume and increased inspiratory flow. Although no clinical signs of respiratory depression were observed with any long term treatment, flurazepam decreased oxygen saturation and inspiratory time and increased respiratory frequency. Neither drug altered breathing control during sleep. Our results indicate that estazolam 2 mg is equally as safe a hypnotic agent as flurazepam for patients with mild COPD.", 
    "87": "The duration of action of hypnosedative drugs is mainly determined by their pharmacokinetic properties. The ideal drug should induce sleep within 30 min and maintain a normal pattern of sleep for 6 to 8h, with little or no residual effects the next morning. Clinically, 4 types of insomnia can be distinguished: prolonged latency, 1 to 2 long periods of wakefulness, frequent short awakenings and early morning awakening. An ultra-short-acting drug (2 to 3h), such as triazolam, is useful for prolonged latency. Temazepam, lormetazepam and loprazolam provide more prolonged effects (8 to 10h). These benzodiazepines are not free of daytime adverse effects, particularly drowsiness, dependency potential, rebound insomnia and habituation to the drug effect. Zopiclone and zolpidem are new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics that are as effective as benzodiazepines but without the problems associated with the latter. They produce a more normal electroencephalogram sleep pattern and so would seem to approach to the ideal hypnosedative for the future. However only further clinical trials and widespread use in practice will determine whether they will live up to this potential.", 
    "88": "The stability of injectable midazolam hydrochloride in a solution for oral use was studied at three temperatures over 56 days. A 2.5-mg/mL oral solution was prepared from injectable midazolam hydrochloride and a flavored, dye-free syrup. Samples of solution were stored in amber glass bottles at 7, 20, or 40 degrees C. Duplicate samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 14, 21, 35, and 56. Samples were also visually inspected on each sampling day. The concentrations of all samples remained greater than 90% of the original concentration and there were no visual signs of microbial growth or changes in color, turbidity, or odor throughout the 56-day period. A 2.5-mg/mL solution of injectable midazolam in syrup was stable for 56 days at 7, 20, or 40 degrees C.", 
    "89": "This study determined the effects of acute administration of lorazepam (LRZ) on brain protein synthesis by examining the translational abilities of polysomal RNA under in vitro conditions compared to those produced by the CNS depressants, ethanol and pentobarbital. Lorazepam (2 mg/kg body weight), ethanol (4 g/kg body weight) or pentobarbital (40 mg/kg body weight) were given orally to 6-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Control groups were either untreated or received the vehicle sesame seed oil orally. The measurement of rectal temperature in each group before (baseline) and 60 min after drug administration showed no change in body temperature in the control or LRZ treated groups but there was a significant temperature drop in the ethanol and pentobarbital group. After 60 min of drug administration, experimental groups when compared to the controls showed significant inhibitions in the translational activities of the cerebral polysomes. The inhibition was most pronounced with polysomes from the LRZ treated group and was consistently observed over a 60 min time period. The findings suggest polysomal translation as one of the major sites of action of LRZ which is independent of changes in body temperature as compared to ethanol and pentobarbital. Since protein synthesis is known to play a key role in learning and memory, the observed inhibitory effects of LRZ may explain its interference with memory consolidation observed under experimental and clinical conditions.", 
    "90": "Single electroacupuncture (EA) exposure (10 Hz, 1 volt, 15 min) to long-term (15 consecutive days) diazepam (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) treated adult male albino rats (120-140 g) potentiated the long-term diazepam-induced increase of GABAergic activity in thalamus (Th) but the long-term diazepam-induced inhibition of GABAergic activity in cerebral cortex (CC) and spinal cord (SC) was disinhibited under similar condition of treatment. These changes in brain regional GABAergic activity may be correlated with the inhibition of single EA-induced analgesia (EAA) under similar conditions of long-term diazepam treatment with single EA exposure. Single EA exposure alone, however, inhibited GABAergic activity in Th and pons-medulla (PM) with the development of EAA. Multiple EA (10 Hz, 1 volt, 10 min/day) exposure along with long-term diazepam for 15 consecutive days inhibited GABAergic activity in CC and SC which is similar to the effect observed with either multiple EA exposure or long-term diazepam alone. But in Th the multiple EA or long-term diazepam-induced increase in GABAergic activity was significantly potentiated with the co-treatment of multiple EA and long-term diazepam for 15 consecutive days. Although GABAergic activity in PM under multiple EA or long-term diazepam treatment alone was not affected their (EA and diazepam) co-exposures under long-term conditions significantly enhanced GABAergic activity in PM. These region specific characteristic changes in central GABAergic activity under long-term treatment of diazepam along with EA may thus explain the potentiation of multiple EA or long-term diazepam-induced analgesia (tail flick latency).", 
    "91": "The DSM-III-R incorporates both distress (symptoms) and disability (impairment) in the definition of a psychiatric disorder. In psychiatric research there is a wide array of instruments used to measure symptom severity, but a limited selection for the assessment of impairment. The psychometric properties of one such instrument, The Sheehan Disability Scale (Sheehan 1983), are evaluated in this paper. The data analyzed come from two studies of patients with panic disorder, the Cross National Collaborative Panic Study--Phase I and the Panic Depression Study. In this report both the alpha coefficients and factor analyses indicate that the reliability of the scale is acceptable. The factor structure of the items and the sensitivity to change of their composite demonstrate satisfactory construct validity. The criterion-related validity is substantiated by the significant relationship between symptomatology and impairment. These analyses were limited to patients with panic disorder. Further work is needed to evaluate the instrument in assessing patients with other disorders.", 
    "92": "Continuous monitoring of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the hippocampus was made during limbic seizure status in cats by means of a heat clearance method with a calibration method by an electrolytic hydrogen clearance method. A stereotaxic operation was made under Nembutal anesthesia. Local anesthetics were applied to the painful area. Femoral artery and vein were cannulated and served for arterial blood pressure monitoring and drug injection, respectively. Tracheostomy was made and ventilated artificially. A double cannula was inserted to the amygdala and fixed to the skull with a dental cement. Electrodes for heat clearance method, electrolytic hydrogen clearance method and EEG recording were inserted to the dorsal hippocampus. Limbic seizure status was induced by kainic acid microinjection (2 ug) into amygdala via implanted cannula. Baseline rCBF was measured in each cats. Continuous monitoring of rCBF was made before and after intravenous administration of anticonvulsants such as zonisamide (ZNS), valproic acid (VPA), diazepam (DZP), phenobarbital (PB) and phenitoin (PHT). Physiological saline (PHS) was injected for controls. Injection of DZP resulted in strong seizure suppression with decrease of arterial blood pressure and hippocampal rCBF. Intravenous PB demonstrated analogous action with DZP with a mild anticonvulsant effect. Intravenous ZNS or VPA resulted in inhibition of seizure propagation from limbic system to cortex. However, these drugs augmented rCBF of the hippocampus more than 2 hours after administration. PHT and PHS demonstrated no anticonvulsant effect nor rCBF change in the present study.", 
    "93": "There is great concern regarding maternal exposure to medications, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy because of the possible teratogenic effects. In the present study we have examined the consequences of maternal drug exposure in vivo upon placental secretion patterns of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and the relationship between the embryo and placenta in vitro. This was examined in samples obtained from various drug-exposed women following elective pregnancy termination at 8-9 weeks. The patterns of HCG secretion in superfused placental explants were different from those seen in control explants (without use of any medication). This was shown by changes in the pulse pattern and pulse frequency. In addition, the exposure of placental explants to various embryonic tissues modified HCG secretion in static cultures. In superfusion, co-perfusion with embryonic spinal cord tissue increased HCG secretion as opposed to that seen in similar incubations made with embryonic spinal cord tissue obtained from healthy women. Thus, our data suggest that maternal drug exposure alters both spontaneous hormone secretion by the placenta and the recently described embryo--placental relationship in vitro.", 
    "94": "Any patient presenting for anesthesia and surgery who has a severe debilitating problem is at great risk for a prolonged recovery, renal failure, or hypotension. A stable hemodynamic state should be maintained. Fluid homeostasis should be ensured. Anesthetic induction techniques using narcotics and benzodiazepines are my preferred approach, with maintenance of anesthesia incorporating isoflurane, narcotics, or both or the use of regional anesthesia.", 
    "95": "Ultrashort barbiturates are not ideal injectable anesthetic agents, and new agents continue to be released as investigators pursue the goal of finding a more ideal agent. Of the new injectable agents discussed, propofol seems to be the most promising drug. Propofol should find a place in veterinary practice as an outpatient anesthetic agent because it has a rapid, smooth, and complete recovery even after repeated or continuous administration. Midazolam does not induce anesthesia in healthy, small animals and, as such, can only be used in combination with other injectable agents, such as ketamine or the thiobarbiturates. In our practice, Telazol has found a place in the anesthetic management of feral cats and aggressive dogs, where it is used for heavy sedation or to induce anesthesia. The role of flumazenil, as a reversal agent, in veterinary practice remains to be determined; however, the role in small domestic animals is unlikely to be significant.", 
    "96": "The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) antagonists were studied in rats responding under a fixed-interval (FI) schedule of food presentation. BRL 43694, GR 38032F, ICS-205,930 and zacopride had no effect on FI responding up to 10.0 mg/kg IP. Response rate decreases were observed only at high doses (30.0 or 56.0 mg/kg); rate increases were not observed. In comparison, caffeine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) and cocaine (3.0-18.0 mg/kg) increased and lorazepam (0.3 mg/kg) decreased FI responding. The effects of caffeine, cocaine, and lorazepam were unchanged when coadministered with the 5-HT3 antagonists. The results show that 5-HT3 antagonists, when given alone or with other CNS-active drugs, have little effect on FI responding of rats.", 
    "97": "The effects of cocaine on defensive withdrawal behavior in rats and elevated plus-maze behavior in mice were investigated. Cocaine (20 mg/kg IP) injected daily for 7 or 14 days induced defensive withdrawal; that is, the latency to emerge from a small chamber in an open field and the mean time in the chamber were both significantly increased. Acute cocaine administration also induced defensive withdrawal, and this effect was prevented by prior treatment with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg IP). Both acute and chronic cocaine treatments significantly increased plasma concentrations of corticosterone and reduced the ratios of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid to dopamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to serotonin in several brain regions. Further evidence for an acute anxiogenic effect of cocaine was obtained from mice studied in the elevated plus-maze. Acute cocaine administration decreased both the number of entries into and the time spent in the open arms of the maze. These results taken together strongly support an anxiogenic action of acute and chronic cocaine administration.", 
    "98": "Reports that the opiate antagonist, naloxone, blocks the anticonflict effects of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide suggest endogenous opioid involvement in the anxiolytic actions of the benzodiazepines. However, naloxone's ability to antagonize the anticonflict effects of the benzodiazepines is not universal, but schedule specific. The present experiments investigated the importance of the timing of conflict periods and control of reinforcement on the naloxone-benzodiazepine interaction. We tested the effects of naloxone (3 mg/kg, IP) and chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, IP) on acquisition of a successive discrimination schedule, with nonreward periods similar in length and frequency to those of signalled DRL, and on an FI60-s schedule. Chlordiazepoxide increased rewarded responding and, unexpectedly, decreased nonrewarded responding during acquisition of successive discrimination. This reduction in nonrewarded responding was reversed by naloxone. Under the FI60 schedule, chlordiazepoxide increased nonrewarded responding, an effect that was totally blocked by naloxone at the beginning of the FI. Naloxone's ability to reverse the response-releasing effect of chlordiazepoxide decreased later in the FI. These results suggest endogenous opioid systems are involved in the anxiolytic actions of the benzodiazepines when the animal is adapting to recently introduced conflict. Once adaptation occurs, other neurotransmitter systems mediate the actions of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "99": "Between 2% and 5% of the population are affected by anxiety disorders. Several studies have shown that imipramine possesses anti-panic and anti-phobic properties. Its response rate is at least 70%. In panic disorder with agoraphobia it is therefore the medication of first choice. Agoraphobia, simple and social phobias are highly responsive to behavioural therapy (desensitization, flooding, social skills training, cognitive restructuring). Drugs have not been found useful in controlled studies. In conjunction with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, behavioural therapy is superior to other psychotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders. Patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorders require first of all supportive psychotherapy. Pharmacological treatment is of limited value. Neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants and beta-blockers are the most appropriate agents for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorders. In addition to that, intense psychotherapy and relaxation techniques should be applied. Further research should address the question of relapse rates after termination of therapy and the elaboration of therapeutic strategies that take individual psychopathology into consideration."
