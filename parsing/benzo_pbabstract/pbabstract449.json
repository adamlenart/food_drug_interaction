    "0": "A noninvasive measure was used to assess the effects of alprazolam, imipramine and placebo on parasympathetic (vagal) cardiac control following 6-weeks of medication in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. Flexible dosage at therapeutic levels resulted in increased heart rate and blood pressure and in decreased cardiac vagal control in patients receiving imipramine but not alprazolam or placebo. About 50% of the variance in heart rate changes and changes in mean arterial blood pressure following treatment with imipramine could be accounted for by changes in cardiac vagal control. Decreased cardiac vagal control can now be added to the list of cardiovascular changes seen following several weeks of treatment with imipramine.", 
    "1": "Twenty-one (three groups of seven), men and women, 25-50 years of age were studied to determine whether or not rebound insomnia would increase the likelihood of self administering a benzodiazepine (triazolam 0.25 mg) hypnotic. The groups compared were patients with insomnia and disturbed sleep, insomnia and normal sleep, and healthy normals. Rebound insomnia, by both subjective and polysomnographic assessment, was induced. The experience of rebound insomnia did not increase the likelihood of self administering a benzodiazepine hypnotic in any of the groups. There were clear group differences in pill self administration with normals rarely and insomnia patients frequently, but not differentially (placebo versus active drug) self administering pills.", 
    "2": "Our electrophysiological studies in female mice have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the accessory olfactory bulb excites tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic arcuate neurons via the amygdala-stria terminalis route. This study shows that the medial preoptic area is identified as an additional relay for the excitatory transmission by examining the effectiveness of locally infused lignocaine anaesthetic in blocking the transmission and that of electrical stimulation in evoking a shorter latency response. Based on the known immunohistochemical findings, further attention is focused on a transmitter mediating synaptic transmission in the medial preoptic area. The cholecystokinin-B type receptor antagonist L-365,260 (0.3, 0.6, 0.9 pmol), but not the A type receptor antagonist L-364,718 (0.9 pmol), infused into the medial preoptic area, blocked the excitation of tuberoinfundibular arcuate neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, cholecystokinin octapeptide (0.6 pmol) increased firing activity in such neurons. The antagonizing effect of L-365,260 was reproduced in the context of the olfactory block to pregnancy: bilateral infusions of this drug into the medical preoptic area of recently mated females immediately before exposures to strange males' pheromones prevented them from inducing pregnancy block. These findings implicate cholecystokinin acting on cholecystokinin-B receptors in the medial preoptic area as a mediator of olfactory influences on reproductive physiology.", 
    "3": "We have evaluated the analgesic effect of continuous intrathecal administration of midazolam in 4 patients using a three-level score (no change, amelioration, and marked improvement). The secondary effects of this drug were also investigated (sedation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, urinary retention, motor dysfunction). In one patient midazolam was the only drug administered, whereas in three patients this drug was associated with morphine. In one patient with a peripheral arteriopathy, midazolam at a dose of 12 mg/day was unable to equal the analgesic effect achieved with 0.4 mg of morphine. The remaining three patients had carcinoma and received a continuous intrathecal perfusion of morphine at increasing daily doses up to 12; 4,8; and 6 mg/day, respectively without pain relief. In these patients the association of midazolam at respective doses of 9; 4-8; and 6 mg/day induced amelioration in one patient and marked improvement in the two other patients. Midazolam did not change the heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure, nor body temperature. We believe that the analgesic effect of intrathecal administration of midazolam is due to its coupling with the ionophore complex GABA-spinal benzodiazepine that in turn produces an increment of the GABA amino butyric acid at this level.", 
    "4": "The effects of the combinations of dexmedetomidine-fentanyl and dexmedetomidine-diazepam on the righting reflex were studied in rats. The doses that block the righting reflex for the agents given alone and for their combinations were determined with a probit procedure and compared with an isobolographic analysis. The interactions between dexmedetomidine and fentanyl or diazepam were found to be synergistic. In the dexmedetomidine-diazepam combination studies, less than one-fourth of the single drug dose (for each of two agents) was needed to produce the required effect. These data confirm synergistic interactions between dexmedetomidine and fentanyl or diazepam in producing hypnotic-anesthetic action.", 
    "5": "Aminophylline, 285.7 +/- 2.19 mg/kg infused intravenously in unanaesthetized rats produced onset of seizures within 3.2 +/- 0.99 minutes. Seizures were repetitive and death occurred in 10.5 +/- 1.75 minutes. Pretreatment of rats with carbamazepine, sodium valproate and diazepam at doses that prevented electroshock induced seizures were effective in significantly postponing seizures and death, but did not reduce mortality. Concomitant EEG studies in aminophylline infused rats showed that cortical excitability evidenced by initial cortical spiking occurred at 42 secs and polyspiking at 165 seconds. Following diazepam, the initial cortical spike was delayed 50 fold, appearing after 36 minutes. Antiepileptic drugs and EEG monitoring may prove useful in patients with status asthmaticus receiving intravenous aminophylline.", 
    "6": "1. The effects of the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine, on contractions of airway smooth muscle induced by cholinergic nerve stimulation and by exogenously applied acetylcholine (ACh), have been investigated in vivo and in vitro in guinea-pigs. 2. Stimulation of the preganglionic cervical vagus nerve in anaesthetized guinea-pigs, caused bronchoconstriction and bradycardia which were mimicked by an intravenous dose of ACh. The muscarinic M2 antagonist, methoctramine (7-240 nmol kg-1), inhibited the bradycardia induced by both vagal stimulation and ACh (ED50: 38 +/- 5 and 38 +/- 9 nmol kg-1, respectively). In this dose-range, methoctramine facilitated vagally-induced bronchoconstriction (ED50: 58 +/- 5 nmol kg-1), despite some inhibition of ACh-induced bronchoconstriction (ED50: 81 +/- 11 nmol kg-1). The inhibition of ACh-induced bronchoconstriction and hypotension was dose-dependent, but was not statistically significant until doses of 120 nmol kg-1 and 240 nmol kg-1 respectively. 3. In the guinea-pig isolated, innervated tracheal tube preparation, methoctramine (0.01-1 microM) caused facilitation of contractions induced by both pre- and postganglionic nerve stimulation, whereas contractions induced by exogenously applied ACh were unaffected. Higher concentrations of methoctramine (greater than or equal to 10 microM), reduced responses to both nerve stimulation and exogenous ACh, indicating blockade of post-junctional muscarinic M3 receptors. 4 ACh caused a slow maintained increase in tone of the tracheal tube and at the same time reduced the contractions induced by nerve stimulation. This inhibitory effect of ACh on neuronally mediated responses was antagonized by methoctramine (0.01-1 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the ACh-induced tone change was unaffected by methoctramine in this concentration-range, indicating a lack of muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist activity in this concentration-range.5. The effect of methoctramine on responses induced by pre- and postganglionic nerve stimulation was not identical. At concentrations of methoctramine of 1 ,microM and greater, preganglionic stimulation-induced contractions were reduced when compared to those induced by postganglionic stimulation, suggesting an inhibitory effect of methoctramine on ganglionic transmission. This ganglion blocking action of methoctramine was not due to its reported M1 receptor antagonist activity (blocking facilitatory Ml receptors in the ganglia) since pirenzepine was without effect in this preparation. We believe that the ganglionic blocking action of metoctramine is due to its nicotinic receptor antagonist properties, since the concentration of methoctramine inhibiting ganglionic transmission in the tube preparation (1 microM) was shown to inhibit contractions induced by the nicotinic agonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazine in tracheal strips.6. These results show that methoctramine is able to demonstrate adequately the presence of autoinhibitory receptors functionally both in vivo and in vitro and confirms their pre-junctional location on pulmonary cholinergic nerve terminals and their classification as muscarinic M2 subtypes. These results also indicate that while methoctramine is a potent muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist, it does not possess the required selectivity to discriminate between cholinoceptor subtypes in preparations, such as the airways, where mixed populations of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinoceptors exist.", 
    "7": "This study was undertaken to determine the involvement of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) in the regeneration of pancreatic tissue after cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis treated by the CCK receptor antagonist L364,718. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by s.c. injections of cerulein in gelatin (12 micrograms/kg) three times a day for 2 days with controls receiving saline in gelatin. Rats were then divided into four treatment groups: saline-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (SD), saline-L364,718 (SA), cerulein-pancreatitis-DMSO (CD), and cerulein-pancreatitis-L364,718 (CA). In the first experiment, rats were treated for 3 or 10 days with DMSO or L364,718 (0.1 mg/kg, twice a day). In the second experiment, rats were treated for 13 days with DMSO or L364,718 (1.0 mg/kg, twice a day). After the rats were killed, pancreata were weighed and evaluated for their total protein, amylase, chymotrypsin, RNA, and DNA. We found that destruction of the pancreatic tissue occurred after cerulein-induced pancreatitis and that regeneration of the tissue was in progress but incomplete after 10 days; the low dose of L364,718 did not prevent regeneration. After 13 days, regeneration was still incomplete but the 1-mg dose of L364,718 strongly inhibited spontaneous regeneration. These data suggest that endogenous CCK is an important and potent trophic factor in the regeneration process of pancreatic tissue following an episode of acute pancreatitis.", 
    "8": "Outbred CD-1 mice were exposed to oxazepam (15 mg/kg PO twice/day) on days 12-16 of fetal life, i.e., at a critical ontogenetic stage of Type II benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor increase, and fostered at birth to untreated dams. Locomotor activity (single 30-min session in a Varimex apparatus), hot-plate responding, and muscimol (GABAa agonist) effects thereon [see normative data in (16)] were assessed on postnatal day 14, 21, or 28. Prenatal oxazepam did not affect the development of hot-plate responding and muscimol analgesia; however, it reduced activity on day 14 (as in previous studies) and modified the profile of muscimol effects at 21 days (time of first appearance of an adult-like pattern of activity) and at 28 days. Specifically, oxazepam mice showed a faster recovery from the initial depression after 1 mg/kg of muscimol at the former age and a lack of rebound hyperactivity at the latter age. These effects might be explained either 1) by an accelerated development of GABAergic regulatory mechanisms, or 2) by the same monoaminergic system changes which can account for other effects of prenatal BDZ exposure (1,3). In any event, the dissociation phenomena found in the present study strengthen the notion that GABAergic influences contribute to the modulation of locomotor activity and of pain reactivity by mechanisms which are at least in part separate from each other (16).", 
    "9": "1. The effects were studied of injecting pregnant Alderley Park mice with the benzodiazepine agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP) at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg during the last 9-10 days of gestation on the early behaviour and development of their offspring. 2. All neonates were fostered to non-treated lactating dams to eliminate maternally-mediated effects. 3. Early development and responses to anxiety-related situations were studied by recording body growth, righting reflex, rooting behaviour, cliff avoidance reflex and ultrasonic \"distress\" calling. 4. Drug treatment: (a) retarded postnatal body growth; (b) delayed the righting and cliff avoidance reflexes; (c) augmented rooting behaviour and (d) produced an overall increase in ultrasonic calling (but with the higher dose decreasing emission on days 1-2). 5. Exposure to CDP during foetal life retards motor development and physical maturation; produces a sedative/anxiolytic action (especially at high doses) and may modify the sensitivity of GABA-BZP receptor complex to endogenous receptor ligands.", 
    "10": "1. Trifluoperazine (EC50 = 11.5 nM), chlorpromazine (13.8 microM), imipramine (15 microM), atropine (75.8 microM), and pirenzepine (316.2 microM), all produced neuromuscular facilitation and antagonized the blockade produced by oxotremorine (20 and 30 microM) in the rat isolated diaphragm. 2. These antagonists did not change the responses of curarized diaphragms to direct stimulation, or the twitch tension produced by retrograde injection of acetylcholine. 3. Trifluoperazine (2.5 ng, intra-arterially) reduced the tetanic fade produced by further intra-arterial injection of d-tubocurarine (10 micrograms/kg) in the in situ cat tibial muscle. 4. These results indicate that these antagonists may interact with muscarinic autoreceptors to increase acetylcholine output in the neuromuscular junction.", 
    "11": "Fifty healthy male subjects were administered zolpidem (5, 10, or 20 mg), triazolam (0.5 mg) or placebo, then attempted to sleep in a non-sleep-conducive environment. Subjects were awakened at 90 min post-drug (near peak blood concentration for both drugs) and tested on several cognitive tasks, including Two Column Addition, Logical Reasoning, and a Simulated Escape Task. This was followed by a second, 3.5-h sleep period. Hypnotic efficacy of the 20 mg zolpidem (Z-20) dose was similar to that of the 0.5 mg triazolam (TRIAZ) dose, as indicated by comparably shortened sleep latencies and lengthened total sleep times. Though accuracy on most performance measures was not affected by either drug, a reduction in speed of responding on logical reasoning and addition tasks was evident for the TRIAZ group at 90 min post-drug (Ps less than 0.05). On the simulated escape task, only triazolam significantly increased the mean number of errors, and interfered with subsequent memory of the task. Thus, zolpidem had milder effects on performance than triazolam. However, 60% of the Z-20 subjects experienced mild, adverse physical reactions. Performance differences between somnogenically comparable doses of zolpidem and triazolam may be due to their differential affinities for the BZ1 and BZ2 receptor subtypes.", 
    "12": "The possible occurrence of benzodiazepine-like substances in human breast milk was investigated in 35 healthy, newly delivered women who were known not to be taking benzodiazepines. Maternal blood samples and a sample of breast milk were obtained on the fifth post partum day. A radioreceptor technique (lower limit of detection 1.5 ng/ml; difference between duplicates at various concentrations less than 7%) was used for measuring benzodiazepine-like substances in blood and breast milk (with and without prior extraction). No benzodiazepine-like substances could be demonstrated in any of the blood samples taken from the 35 women. Measurable concentrations of benzodiazepine-like substances were demonstrated in all but 1 of the 35 breast milk samples. The mean concentration of benzodiazepine-like substances for all 35 women was 4.3 +/- 2.3 ng/ml (range 0-9.3 ng/ml) expressed as lorazepam. The corresponding value for extracted breast milk was 2.6 +/- 1.5 ng/ml (range 0-7.0 ng/ml). There was no association between concentrations of benzodiazepine-like substances in breast milk and maternal age, weight, height and body mass or parity, or the sex of the infant and infant birth weight. We suggest that non-detectable amounts of benzodiazepine-like substances in serum are concentrated in the mammillary glands and excreted in a higher concentration in breast milk. It is less likely that the relevant benzodiazepines are produced in the mammillary glands.", 
    "13": "Diazepam-sensitive (DS) and -resistant (DR) mice were selectively bred for increased and reduced sensitivity to the ataxic effects of diazepam (40 mg/kg). Other response differences between DS and DR mice may reflect pleiotropic effects of the genes fixed during their selection. These mice were tested for their sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant effects of several doses of diazepam, flunitrazepam, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, and ethanol. DR mice were more sensitive than DS mice to the locomotor stimulant effects of all drugs except phenobarbital. These results largely support the hypothesis that a common biological mechanism mediates sensitivity to the stimulant effects of sedative-hypnotic drugs. Receptor mediation of the benzodiazepine effects was examined by administering the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, RO15-1788. Locomotor depression produced by diazepam and flunitrazepam in DS mice was blocked by RO15-1788. However, while the locomotor stimulation produced by diazepam in DR mice was antagonized, the stimulant effect of flunitrazepam was not. This suggests that binding of flunitrazepam to the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor is not necessary for production of locomotor stimulation.", 
    "14": "In a placebo controlled, crossover study psychomotor effects of single doses of diazepam, 10 and 20 mg, flunitrazepam, 1 and 2 mg, as well as 0.9 g ethanol/kg body weight were investigated over a time period of 6 h in 12 healthy men. Blood samples were collected simultaneously with the test sessions to determine drug concentrations in plasma or blood. The ethanol dose caused the least performance impairment, followed by 10 mg diazepam. The most pronounced impairment was caused by 2 mg flunitrazepam, whereas 20 mg diazepam and 1 mg flunitrazepam caused intermediate impairment and were approximately equipotent on group level. Considerable interindividual differences with respect to maximal impairment following a particular drug treatment were observed, with poor correlation between individual maximal impairments and individual peak plasma concentrations of the drug. The maximal impairment in simple reaction time following the flunitrazepam treatments occurred earlier relative to the peak plasma concentration of the drug as compared to the diazepam treatments. This may indicate that acute tolerance develops differently for the two drugs.", 
    "15": "The anticonvulsant effects and duration of protective action of midazolam against Metrazol induced seizures were studied in 528 rats aged 7,12,18,25 and 90 days. The doses of 0.025, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg were administered immediately before Metrazol (100 mg/kg in all but 18-day-old animals where 90 mg/kg were given) for detection of antimetrazol activity at all age groups. The doses of 0.05, 0.25, and/or 0.5 mg/kg were used to study the time course of the protective action of midazolam. Each experimental group consisted of eight animals. Dose-dependent antimetrazol effects of midazolam till now described only in adult animals were demonstrated at all developmental stages studied. There were no qualitative differences in these effects among age groups studied. Midazolam action was better expressed against major Metrazol seizures than against minimal Metrazol seizures. Duration of the protective action depended on the dose tested at all developmental stages, as a rule, lasted longer in young animals than in adult rats. Only quantitative changes of action were found.", 
    "16": "A life-threatening intoxication, requiring ventilatory support, is reported from the ingestion of 3.05 g of buflomedil, a peripheral vasodilator. Buflomedil at a dosage of 50 mg/kg weight produces seizures. Hypotension is not a specific symptom of intoxication. Buflomedil poisoning can be easily confused with other drugs, especially tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "17": "A fatal case of strychnine intoxication is reported. The patient expired despite early aggressive management and prevention of metabolic complications. Serial blood levels are reported. In contrast to a previous report describing first order elimination kinetics, our data suggest that strychnine follows Michaelis-Menton elimination kinetics. The case illustrates the rapid, dramatic course of severe strychnine ingestions. A review of the toxicokinetics, mechanism of action and treatment of strychnine intoxication follows.", 
    "18": "One hundred and seven bronchological examinations using midazolam narcosis in association with flumazenil were carried out in 100 children (mean age 3.5 years, range 4 months to 14 years) suffering from chronic non-specific lung disease. Rigid bronchoscopy was followed in 49 cases by bronchography. All patients were premedicated with atropine followed by midazolam (0.2 mg/kg intravenously). Ventilation was carried out with nitrous oxide and oxygen in 47 children and with oxygen only in 60 patients. After 3 mins, suxamethonium (2 mg/kg intravenously) was given for muscle relaxation and intubation carried out. Fifty-one of the children ventilated with oxygen only also received fentanyl (0.002 mg/kg intramuscularly), at the same time as atropine, to provide analgesia. After extubation, all patients were given flumazenil (0.1 to 0.2 mg intravenously) to reverse the effects of midazolam. The results showed that midazolam provided effective sedation and comfortable sleep (mean examination time 12 min 50 sec) and it was considered that the method using fentanyl rather than nitrous oxide for analgesia was the most satisfactory one. Patients awakened promptly (1 min) after flumazenil and quick and effective expectoration was noted, particularly important in those who had undergone bronchography. No complications were observed. Since this investigation, a further 500 bronchoscopics have been carried out using this method with the same results. Even though no narcosis equipment is required, it is recommended that, as with other procedures involving narcosis with muscle relaxation, bronchoscopy with these drugs should not be used in out-patients.", 
    "19": "A combination of metoclopramide, dexamethasone, droperidol, lorazepam, and diphenhydramine was used in prophylaxis of high-dose (greater than or equal to 100 mg/m2) or moderate dose (greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2) cisplatin. Sixty minutes prior to starting cisplatin, 16 mg dexamethasone, 50 mg diphenhydramine, and 0.5 mg lorazepam were given orally (PO). Droperidol 1 mg was given intramuscularly (IM) 15 minutes prior to beginning cisplatin. Repetitive doses of intravenous (IV) metoclopramide, 2 mg/kg in 75 ml 5% dextrose in water over 15 minutes was given 30 minutes prior to, and at 1 1/2, 4 1/2, and 7 1/2 hours after beginning cisplatin chemotherapy. Only patients with nausea and/or vomiting received subsequent doses of 2 mg/kg metoclopramide IV every 3 hours as needed. Patients refractory to metoclopramide were given 1 mg droperidol IM and 50 mg of diphenhydramine PO every 6 hours. There were 19 men and 9 women with a median age of 58 (range 31-75) years. Complete protection from nausea and vomiting in all courses of treatment occurred in 17 (61%) patients. In 63% and 70% of the 57 evaluable courses, there was neither nausea nor vomiting, during the first 24 hours after cisplatin. When present, nausea was mild and the median number of vomiting episodes was 2 (range 1-3). This antiemetic regimen was well tolerated. Toxicities were mild and occurred in 3 patients (angioneurotic edema, transient episode of facial twitching, and heaviness of tongue, respectively). The 5-drug antiemetic combination can prevent cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting in a majority of patients.", 
    "20": "Thirty females performed a visual vigilance task under the influence of bromazepam (6 and 12 mg) in a placebo-controlled, double blind, experiment. Measures employed were percentage of hits, percentage of false alarms, response latency (RT), A' (sensitivity), B\" (cautiousness), and RI (responsivity), as well as signal- and non-signal event-related potentials (ERPs). Bromazepam did not aggravate the normally occurring decrement in performance in vigilance tasks, but had an effect on overall level of performance: accuracy was reduced under the influence of the drug, but speed improved. A Drug x Period interaction for cautiousness (B\") indicated increasingly less cautiousness with bromazepam, which probably contributed to faster motor responses (and more errors) than in the placebo group. The ERP data suggest that the effects of bromazepam are already manifest in the early stages of information processing (attention-detection) as mirrored by a drug effect on N1 amplitude. Deterioration at this early stage may affect later processing stages (P2-N2 amplitudes). As a result, subjects under the influence of the drug probably accumulate less signal evidence for their final evaluation.", 
    "21": "The effects of several centrally active drugs were investigated using two visual discrimination tasks: a two-lever food-rewarded conditional brightness discrimination, and a similar conditional brightness discrimination where a delay was introduced between the disappearance of the stimulus and the opportunity to respond on the levers for food. The substances tested (amphetamine, scopolamine, methylscopolamine, physostigmine, diazepam and beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, ZK 93426), all produced differing profiles of action on the performance parameters recorded. In the simple conditional visual discrimination, amphetamine increased omissions without significant effects on accuracy or response latency. Physostigmine enhanced response latencies and failures to respond without significant effects on accuracy. ZK 93426 had no consistent effects on accuracy although at higher doses, some increase in response latency was seen in the delayed responding version of the visual discrimination task. Diazepam had negative effects on all parameters in both discrimination procedures. Scopolamine disrupted responding, but not accuracy in the simple discrimination, whereas accuracy was reduced in a dose, but not delay dependent manner in the delayed discrimination. A similar effect to that observed with scopolamine was observed following methylscopolamine in the delayed discrimination procedure. In the simple visual discrimination small increases in accuracy were recorded, accompanied by increased response latencies.", 
    "22": "Eighteen non-pregnant woman complaining about insomnia were polysomnographically investigated for 3 nights with weekly intervals. They received placebo, 2 mg flunitrazepam or 10 mg zolpidem according to a cross-over double blind design. The patients were selected by general practitioners on the basis of subjective complaints. Zolpidem is a recently introduced short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic, binding to a subunit of the benzodiazepine 1 receptor. Flunitrazepam is a well-known hypnotic, binding to both the benzodiazepine 1 and 2 receptor subtypes. Objective recording did not substantiate the subjective complaint of insomnia. Sleep patterns during placebo differed only little from that expected from age matched healthy persons. Both flunitrazepam and zolpidem significantly shortened sleep onset (5 min of continuous sleep beginning with NREM 1 sleep). The sleep composition following flunitrazepam was characterized by an increase in NREM 2, a prolongation of the time of REM sleep, a reduction of REM sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 sleep during the first 2 h of sleep. The sleep composition following zolpidem resembled more than seen in persons without sleep complaints. However, as compared to placebo, there was a decrease of the time spent awake during sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 during the first 2 of sleep.", 
    "23": "Because previous studies assumed that tetanus is an acetylcholine intoxication, atropine as a potent anticholinergic agent has been employed as a continuous infusion in the treatment of 4 severe tetanus cases as a supplement to routine therapy. With this treatment all patients maintained complete cardiovascular stability; clinical symptoms like bronchospasm, bronchial hypersecretion, hypersalivation, hyperperspiration were not encountered at any period of the treatment. All patients were markedly sedated and despite the use of mechanical ventilation, curarisation was not necessary at all. These results suggest that the multiple effects (CNS, cardiovascular respiratory and muscular tone) of atropine might be very useful in the management of severe tetanus.", 
    "24": "Midazolam is a water soluble benzodiazepine, with a short elimination half-life in adults and children. An IV bolus (0.2 mg.kg-1) immediately followed by continuous infusion of 0.06 mg.kg-1.h-1 was administered to 15 critically ill neonates at a gestational age of 32.8 weeks, who required sedation for mechanical ventilation. Heart rate and blood pressure were closely monitored. Hypotension occurred in 4 patients after the bolus dose or during the continuous infusion. Three of them had also been given fentanyl. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: plasma clearance was 3.9 ml.min-1, elimination half-life was 12.0 h. Because of its short half-life compared to diazepam, midazolam may be used during the neonatal period to achieve rapid, brief sedation. However, it should be administered cautiously to neonates, particularly in premature infants, or if fentanyl is also given.", 
    "25": "The tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD) were assessed following intravenous infusions of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg adinazolam mesylate, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg NDMAD mesylate, and placebo. Six subjects per dose level received treatments in a double-blind crossover design. No clinically significant changes were seen in blood pressure, pulse, respiration, or clinical laboratory parameters. Untoward effects typical of benzodiazepines were observed almost exclusively after NDMAD administration. Adinazolam and NDMAD pharmacokinetics were dose-independent. NDMAD clearance was 50% of the value for adinazolam. Adinazolam and NDMAD administrations increased uric acid clearance and decreased plasma uric acid. Adinazolam administration had no significant effect on psychomotor performance. NDMAD administration produced dose related decreases in performance; 286 ng/ml NDMAD produced a 50% decrease in DSST. These results confirm that adinazolam and NDMAD both produce uricosuria and definitively show that adinazolam is devoid of benzodiazepine-like effects at therapeutic concentrations; NDMAD mediates these effects. Uricosuric activity is present for both compounds, but the relative potencies are still unknown.", 
    "26": "We conducted a study to examine the role of cholecystokinin in feeding behavior and weight change in rats with obstructive jaundice. Daily food and water intake, body weight, and short-term food intake were determined in two groups of rats with surgically induced obstructive jaundice and in control rats. One group of rats with obstructive jaundice was given L-364,718, a selective cholecystokinin receptor antagonist. Plasma bilirubin and cholecystokinin levels were measured in each rat before and 7 days after surgery. Daily food intake and body weight were decreased in obstructive jaundice rats compared with control rats during the first week after surgery (P less than .05); however, obstructive jaundice rats treated with L-364,718 had increased food intake and body weight (P less than .05). Short-term food intake measured for 30 minutes and 120 minutes in food-deprived obstructive jaundice rats was decreased when compared with control rats (P less than .05), but the obstructive jaundice rats given L-364,718 had increased short-term food intake (P less than .05). Water intake was similar between the two groups of rats. Plasma levels of cholecystokinin and bilirubin were increased in obstructive jaundice rats with and without L-364,718 treatment (P less than .05). The results support the concept that endogenously elevated levels of plasma cholecystokinin play an important role in decreased food intake and subsequent loss of body weight in rats with obstructive jaundice.", 
    "27": "A first rational concept for the in vivo formation of naturally occurring diazepam-type 1,4-benzodiazepines is suggested--by oxidative carbon-carbon bond cleavage of the known quinoline alkaloid viridicatin, a fungal metabolite from Penicillium species, replacement of the resulting N-oxaloyl substituent by a glycinoyl residue, and subsequent ring closure under Schiff base formation. In principle, all the proposed individual reaction steps as such are known from the literature: they have either been proven to occur in vivo, or they have been performed chemically. According to this concept, diazepam-type benzodiazepines would not only represent the joint result of both industrial developments and evolutionary processes in nature, but would even arise from identical precursors--ortho-aminobenzophenone and glycine! Alternatively, according to a slightly modified (more \"economical\") biogenetic concept, the oxaloyl residue would not be substituted, but rather converted into the glycinoyl part. This hypothetic biosynthesis of naturally occurring 1,4-benzodiazepines might proceed in part in microorganisms (e.g. in fungi) and in part in higher organisms (e.g. in plants).", 
    "28": "Although light provides the primary signal for the entrainment of circadian pacemakers, a number of endogenous substances and pharmacological agents are also capable of resetting circadian pacemakers. Very little is known about the combined effects of photic and nonphotic agents on clock functions. We conducted a \"double-pulse\" experiment, in which two discrete stimuli are presented at different times within a single circadian cycle, to determine the combined effects of a 1-hr light pulse and injections of a benzodiazepine, triazolam, on the circadian rhythm of activity in the golden hamster. Our results suggest that, first, when given together as done in these experiments, the effects of triazolam and light are partially but not completely additive. Triazolam-induced phase advances appeared to make the effects of subsequent 1-hr light pulses more negative; phase delays were increased, and phase advances were decreased. Second, it appears that triazolam and light may alter the circadian pacemaker in very different ways, beyond the obvious difference in the shape of their phase response curves. The phase-shifting mechanics of the circadian system of the golden hamster appear to involve a longer response time to triazolam than to light pulses. Alternative possibilities to account for this difference are discussed.", 
    "29": "Forty-eight healthy volunteers received 0.2 mg/kg oral diazepam or a placebo in a double-blind manner. The effect of the drug on memory was assessed by the free recall of unrelated word lists, and arousal was assessed by subjective ratings of drowsiness, multiple trials of a digit cancellation task, and the rate at which subjects rehearsed aloud items from the word lists. As expected, diazepam, depressed both memory functioning and all three measures of arousal. However, within the diazepam group, rehearsal rate was the only arousal measure that correlated with performance on the recall task. When looking at change scores, or the degree to which performance deteriorated from baseline to the diazepam condition, digit cancellation reduction was the only arousal measure that correlated with recall deterioration. Analyses also revealed that the three arousal measures did not correlate with each other. Results support the view that the arousal/attentional system is composed of partially independent subsystems with varying relationships to memory functioning.", 
    "30": "The effects of benzodiazepine (triazolam 0.25 and 0.50 mg) on different aspects of cognitive function were assessed. Triazolam impaired free recall and recognition of information presented after drug administration. In contrast to these impairments in explicit memory, a memory function that did not require conscious awareness was not altered by triazolam. Similarly, triazolam did not affect subjects' abilities to access semantic memory.", 
    "31": "Rats were trained on a nonmatching-to-sample task with delays of 2, 5, and 10 min. Subsequently, performance was assessed in three groups of rats following treatment with saline or diazepam (2.0 mg/kg) administered acutely or tested chronically in six administrations. Relative to treatment with saline, diazepam produced a deficit in discrimination performance, which was greater in the acutely treated rats than in those treated chronically. The deficit was not dependent on the length of the delays. Diazepam-treated animals differed from controls in erring on trials in which they failed to investigate both test objects, failed to investigate the test object for a long enough period of time, and displaced the test object on the preferred side of the apparatus. The hypothesis that these effects represented a sedation-like reduction in behavioral variability was also supported by evidence of a diazepam-induced decrease in gross bodily activity, increase in inactivity, and increase in latencies to respond to objects. No support was found for the involvement of diazepam-induced changes in habituation, extinction, or reward effects.", 
    "32": "In an open clinical trial patients with full-developed delirium tremens were treated either by controlled infusion of clomethiazol (n = 21) or by intravenous injections of clorazepate (n = 20). Acute symptomatic quickly decreased after a few days and medication could be reduced. By adding haloperidol a further stabilization in patients suffering from vivid hallucinations could be obtained. The duration of intravenous therapy and the total period of treatment did not differ in the two groups. Statistical analysis of cardiovascular parameters revealed a significant lower heart rate under clorazepate therapy. So treatment with clorazepate proved to be an alternative to standard therapy with clomethiazol even for severe cases of delirium tremens regarding its wide therapeutical range and the low rate of cardio-pulmonary complications.", 
    "33": "The influence of fluoxetine on triazolam pharmacokinetics was studied because of changes in diazepam pharmacokinetics reportedly produced by fluoxetine. Twenty-four healthy volunteers received a single 0.25-mg triazolam tablet alone, and another 0.25-mg tablet after 8 days of fluoxetine therapy 60 mg/day. All subjects received these treatments in the same sequence. Several blood samples were drawn from the subjects after the triazolam doses and were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Blood samples were drawn immediately before the last three fluoxetine doses to determine the concentration of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine, also by HPLC. The pharmacokinetics of triazolam did not change significantly when the tablets were administered after multiple doses of fluoxetine. These results indicate that no pharmacokinetic interaction exists between triazolam and fluoxetine or norfluoxetine. However, each patient's clinical response to therapy should be monitored when triazolam tablets and fluoxetine capsules are administered concomitantly.", 
    "34": "Manifestations of acute hyperarousal in the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have been assimilated with panic attacks. This study examines the auditory startle reflex in PTSD patients treated with clonazepam, a benzodiazepine with anti-panic properties. PTSD patients treated with clonazepam did not differ from drug-free PTSD patients in the magnitude and the habituation rate of their responses to an auditory startle, with both groups showing abnormally slow habituation. It is suggested that the mechanisms underlying phasic hyperarousal in PTSD might differ from those which have been implied in the genesis of panic attacks.", 
    "35": "The blood-brain barrier penetration of amsacrine and its analogs 9-([2-methoxy-4-[(methylsulfonyl)-amino]phenyl]amino)-,5-dimethyl- 4-acridine carboxamide (CI-921) and M-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-acridine-4-carboxamide (AC) was measured in the barbiturate-anesthetized mouse. After intracarotid administration, AC was almost completely extracted (90%) in a single transit through the brain capillaries, whereas CI-921 (20%) and amsacrine (15%) were moderately extracted. AC is retained in the brain; no loss of AC from the brain was apparent at 1, 2, 4, or 8 min after injection. In contrast, after intraportal administration, 75% of the AC, 94% of the CI-921, and 57% of the amsacrine was extracted in a single transit through the hepatic vasculature. Rather than being retained in the mouse liver, these acridine antitumor agents show time-dependent loss (t1/2 = 10 min for amsacrine and AC, 24 min for CI-921). We conclude that unlike most antitumor agents, these acridine drugs appear to penetrate the blood-brain barrier readily.", 
    "36": "To define further the place of dexamethasone in antiemetic combinations, lorazepam, prochlorperazine and placebo (LP) were compared with lorazepam, prochlorperazine and dexamethasone (DLP) in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study. Both patient and observer assessments were documented in 84 patients receiving both cisplatin and non-cisplatin chemotherapy. The addition of dexamethasone significantly reduced the severity of nausea (P = 0.002) and vomiting (P less than 0.0001), duration of nausea (P = 0.01) and vomiting (P = 0.002) and the number of vomiting episodes (P = 0.003). DLP was the superior regimen in subsets of patients receiving cisplatin and the non-cisplatin chemotherapy. The improvements produced by the dexamethasone regimen were large and of major benefit to our patients. Patients documented significantly improved tolerance to chemotherapy with DLP courses (P = 0.0006). Overall, significantly more patients preferred DLP (P less than 0.0001). Patient assessments produced results similar to observer assessments but gave a broader understanding of their experience. The addition of dexamethasone to prochlorperazine and lorazepam significantly improved our patients' experience while receiving chemotherapy.", 
    "37": "Nitrazepam is a valuable drug, being one of the often used minor tranquillizers in psychotherapy. However, its solubility characteristics are very unfavourable. Products were prepared with dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin in different combinations (8.58%, 19.48% and 27.29%) and by several methods such as mixing, kneading, precipitation and spray-drying.", 
    "38": "This paper presents a clinical overview of syndromal anxiety and its treatment as seen in a family practice setting, where many patients with anxiety disorders are first seen. Panic disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder are the ones most often seen by such physicians. Treatment options include psychotherapy, behavioral-cognitive therapy, and pharmacotherapy. The primary care physician may choose from the benzodiazepines or the heterocyclic antidepressants or both. The monoamine oxidase inhibitors have also proved very useful in the treatment of panic disorder and social phobia, but probably should be used only by physicians with experience with this type of medication.", 
    "39": "1. Male hooded Lister rats were fed a liquid diet containing 10% absolute ethanol for 4-5 weeks. Control rats received the liquid diet in amounts controlled to produce equal weight gain. 2. The rats were tested 7.5 h after withdrawal of ethanol and 30 min after i.p. injection with nitrendipine, chlordiazepoxide or baclofen or 20 min after i.p. injection with flumazenil. 3. Nitrendipine (25-100 mg/kg) was unable to reverse the anxiogenic responses detected on withdrawal from ethanol, but the highest dose did reduce withdrawal tremor. 4. Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), flumazenil (4 mg/kg) and baclofen (1.25 mg/kg) significantly reversed the anxiogenic response detected on withdrawal from ethanol. 5. These reversals of ethanol withdrawal responses are similar to the reversal of the increased anxiety detected on withdrawal from chronic treatment with benzodiazepines. 6. The mechanisms and clinical implications of these drug-induced reversals are discussed.", 
    "40": "We have previously reported that microinjections of the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam into the medial preoptic area (MPA) of the hypothalamus enhance sleep in rats. The present study further characterizes this effect, by examining its anatomical specificity, determining whether it is mediated by interaction with central benzodiazepine receptors, and assessing whether sleep induction is associated with changes in core temperature. It was found that microinjections of 0.25 and 0.5 micrograms triazolam into two nearby structures, the lateral preoptic area and diagonal band of Broca, failed to alter sleep. Total sleep time was enhanced by microinjection of triazolam into the MPA, and this effect was blocked by co-administration of the benzodiazepine receptor blocker RO 15-1788. Sleep enhancement by triazolam was not associated with significant alterations in core body temperature. These observations continue to suggest that the MPA may be a site which mediates the hypnotic effect of triazolam, and add to the growing body of data emphasizing the importance of hypothalamic function in the regulation of sleep and waking.", 
    "41": "This study compares the effects of buspirone (5 mg), chlordiazepoxide (5 mg), hydroxyzine (10 mg) and placebo on psychomotor function and EEG, when taken thrice daily for a period of two weeks, with those after a single dose administration. Nine healthy volunteers participated in the study. The battery of psychomotor tests included peak velocity of saccadic eye movements (SEM), a Sternberg memory scanning and choice reaction time test (SMS-CRT) and critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF). The peak velocity of saccadic eye movements was significantly impaired by the single dose of hydroxyzine (P = 0.03) in comparison to the multidose results. A similar comparison regarding buspirone only approached significance (P = 0.07). The SMS-CRT and CFFF did not reveal any difference between the multi and single dose regimens. Spectral analysis of the EEG did not distinguish between the multi and single dosage schedules regarding the respective drugs in the low doses administered.", 
    "42": "The effects of a specific cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist (L364,718) and a gastrin receptor antagonist (L365,260) on gastrin-releasing peptide-10 (GRP-10)-stimulated pancreatic secretion were investigated in the anesthetized rat. GRP-10 stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of 1.0 nmol/kg/h elicited a significant increase in pancreatic protein output. L364,718 (2.0 mg/kg/h), at a dose that completely inhibited the stimulatory effect of exogenous CCK-8 (3.0 nmol/kg/h) on pancreatic secretion, did not suppress the excitatory effect of GRP-10. L365,260 (5.0 mg/kg/h), at a dose that completely inhibited the stimulatory effect of exogenous gastrin (20 micrograms/kg/h) on gastric acid secretion, did not suppress the excitatory effect of GRP-10 either. We concluded that CCK or gastrin do not mediate the excitatory mechanism of bombesin/GRP on pancreatic secretion. Since CCK and gastrin are the most probable candidates for excitatory mediator of bombesin/GRP, these results support the hypothesis that bombesin/GRP directly stimulates the exocrine pancreas in the rat.", 
    "43": "MK-329 is a nonpeptidal, highly specific cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, with affinity for pancreatic and gallbladder CCK receptors similar to CCK itself. MK-329 and its progenitor, asperlicin, can inhibit the growth of CCK receptor-positive human pancreatic cancer in athymic mice. Based on these activities and the ability of MK-329 to transiently increase food intake and enhance morphine analgesia in murine models, we conducted an open trial of MK-329 in 18 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in whom the CCK receptor status of the tumors was unknown. Tumor response, pain control, and nutritional parameters (hunger rating, caloric intake, body weight, and anthropometrics) were serially assessed. The results of the study failed to demonstrate any impact of MK-329 on tumor progression, pain, or nutrition. Toxicity was mild and limited to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, with 17 of 18 patients able to tolerate treatment. While a role for MK-329 in the management of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer cannot be supported by the results of this trial, additional studies of this agent in patients with known CCK receptor-positive tumors, at escalated doses, and possibly in conjunction with other growth antagonists, appear warranted.", 
    "44": "In vivo microdialysis was used to assess the effects of acute and repeated injections of the benzodiazepine midazolam on extracellular dopamine (DA) concentrations in the nucleus accumbens. Acute administration of midazolam (5 mg/kg, SC) elicited a 22% decrease in extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens but failed to affect DA concentrations in the striatum. Similarly, six spaced intravenous infusions of midazolam, at a dose that has previously been found to support self-administration (0.05 mg per infusion), produced a 50% decrease in extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens. In order to assess the effects of subchronic midazolam injections, two groups of rats were given injections of saline or midazolam (5 mg/kg, SC) for 14 days (two injections per day). A subsequent challenge injection of midazolam (5 mg/kg) decreased extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens by 25% in both groups, indicating that neither tolerance nor sensitization occurred during the repeated drug administration. These experiments indicate (1) that midazolam differentially affects meso-accumbens and nigrostriatal DA neurons, and (2) that the midazolam-induced decrease in extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens is not affected by repeated drug administration. The data further suggest that the rewarding effects of midazolam are not associated with increased release of DA in the nucleus accumbens.", 
    "45": "Lidocaine (lignocaine) was given in 42 episodes of status epilepticus (SE) in 36 patients either because of limited pulmonary reserve (22 patients) or because of lack of response to diazepam (14 patients). Lidocaine (1.5-2 mg/kg) was given intravenously in two minutes. A further identical bolus was infused if no response had occurred or if seizures recurred. With the first bolus 11 episodes of SE did not stop, but 31 responded, always in less than one minute. In 19 episodes, however, this response lasted less than 30 minutes. Twelve episodes did not recur, but 30 needed a second bolus because of recurrence. Of these, 19 episodes responded at once but SE reappeared in seven. In these seven episodes the mean control time with the second dose was 102 minutes. Five of these subsequently responded to a continuous infusion of lidocaine. Eleven patients, who had not responded to the first bolus, had no response to the second. Lidocaine is a drug that may be epileptogenic at high doses. At the doses used here, however, lidocaine seems to be a rapid acting anticonvulsant, useful in the short term management of SE and may be indicated in patients in whom respiratory or consciousness depression is undesirable and in those with no response to diazepam. The absence of response to lidocaine indicates SE resistant to treatment and poor prognosis. These data show that prompt lidocaine administration may be worthwhile when management of respiratory depression is not possible.", 
    "46": "Based on a case history of fetal haemorrhage due to maternal antiepileptic treatment and a review of 40 previously described similar cases, it is recommended that epileptic mothers receive vitamin K tablets throughout the month before delivery and intravenously during labour. It is further recommended that phytomenadione should be administered intravenously to the infant immediately after birth. Cord blood specimens should be submitted for immediate clotting studies and if diminished vitamin K-dependent factors are found, fresh frozen plasma should be given at a dose of 20 ml/kg over a period of 1-2 h. Alternatively, the drug treatment of women with epilepsy during pregnancy could be changed from liver enzyme inducing drugs to clonazepam, which is a benzodiazepine without liver enzyme-inducing properties. Further, no malformations have been reported in connection with this drug.", 
    "47": "Optimal dose of epidural midazolam with saline for postoperative pain relief was investigated. Forty three patients for upper abdominal surgery were divided into 5 groups. Each group had either 10 ml saline only (saline group), 10 ml saline + midazolam 0.025 mg.kg-1 (0.025 group), 10 ml saline + midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 (0.05 group), 10 ml saline + midazolam 0.075 mg.kg-1 (0.075 group), or 10 ml saline + midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1 (0.1 group) administered epidurally for complaint of postoperative pain. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and sedation score (SS) were monitored for 120 minutes, and the time interval for next analgesics (TNA) was checked. In each group, BP was unchanged compared with preinjection level. HR changes were less in 0.05 and 0.1 group than in others. RR changes were less in 0.025 and 0.05 group than in others. Optimal SSs were obtained in 0.025 and 0.05 groups. In 0.075 and 0.1 groups, many patients fell into complete sleep (not responded to verbal command). TNA was about 2 hours in 0.025 and 0.05 groups, over 6 hours in 0.075 and 0.1 groups. Complete sleep was the cause of long TNA in 0.075 and 0.1 groups. It was concluded that optimal dose of epidural midazolam with saline 10 ml was 0.05 mg.kg-1 for postoperative pain relief after upper abdominal surgery.", 
    "48": "Positive or negative chronotropic effects of atropine and their magnitude are known to be determined primarily by patient's age, atropine dose, anesthetic agents or techniques, and preanesthetic medication. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of oral diazepam upon the hemodynamic responses to intravenous atropine in awake patients. Diazepam group (n = 26) received oral diazepam, 10 mg, whereas control group (n = 20) received no premedication. The direction and magnitude of heart rate and blood pressure responses to atropine were similar between the two groups. Heart rate significantly decreased from baseline values following atropine, 2.5 micrograms.kg-1, returned to baseline values following cumulative atropine doses, 5 micrograms.kg-1, then significantly increased from baseline values following cumulative atropine dose, 10 micrograms.kg-1 in both groups. Mean blood pressure significantly decreased from baseline values following cumulative atropine dose, 2.5 and 5 micrograms.kg-1, and returned to baseline following cumulative atropine dose, 10 micrograms.kg-1, in both groups. It is concluded that oral diazepam, 10 mg, as a premedicant does not alter the hemodynamic responses to intravenous atropine in humans.", 
    "49": "The authors suggest use of the fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) technique in evaluation of chronic drug abuse using human hair. Hair was decontaminated in 5 mL of ethanol for 15 min at 37 degrees C and then incubated in 3 mL of 1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 1 h at 100 degrees C. Afterwards, the aliquots were neutralized and analyzed using Abbott ADx for a negative or positive response for the following drugs: benzodiazepines, barbiturates, antidepressants, opiates, cocaine, amphetamine, and cannabis. All the positive samples were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Only one false positive was detected (caused by interference of a phenothiazine with the antidepressants kit), clearly demonstrating the capability of ADx for toxicological screening of human hair.", 
    "50": "In order to assess behaviour changes among intravenous drug users we interviewed 51 IVDUs attending a general practice in Edinburgh. The data obtained was compared with equivalent data gathered in 1986. We were able to show that significant changes in injecting behaviour have occurred and have been maintained over time. A decrease in HIV seroprevalence in this group was also found. The primary drugs of abuse are benzodiazepines and pharmacological opiates, a fact which has important implications for the medical authorities.", 
    "51": "The reactivity of 40 panic disorder patients on mental arithmetic, cold pressor, and 5% CO2 inhalation stressors was tested before and after 8 weeks of treatment with imipramine, alprazolam, or placebo. Mean levels of subjective and physiological stress measures were compared during a baseline before any stressors were given, and at anticipation, stressor, and recovery periods for each stressor. After treatment, imipramine patients differed from the other two treatment groups on the prestressor baseline in showing higher systolic blood pressure (mean difference about 10 mmHg), higher diastolic blood pressure (10 mm Hg), higher heart rate (15 bpm), less respiratory sinus arrhythmia, shorter pulse transit time, and lower T-wave amplitude. Respiratory measures, electrodermal measures, body movement, and self-reported anxiety and excitement did not distinguish the groups. Reactivity to the stress tests was unaffected by the medications, but tonic differences present in the baseline persisted.", 
    "52": "Over the past several years, major advances have been made in understanding the pharmacology of anxiety, involving three broad classes of experimental approach. One approach studies the mechanism of action of drugs that are known to treat anxiety clinically, such as the benzodiazepines. A second approach uses various animal models of fear or anxiety that are sensitive to known anxiolytic drugs, to see if they will detect new compounds. A third approach involves describing the neural pathways and neurotransmitters that are active in a state of fear or anxiety; importantly, this approach is not derived from the mechanisms of known anxiolytics. In this review, Michael Davis describes such a 'neural systems' approach to the study of fear or anxiety that uses the paradigm of fear-potentiated startle.", 
    "53": "Rats, chronically treated with diazepam (4 mg/kg/day) for 28 days, displayed increased anxiety when tested in the elevated plus-maze, 42 hr after the last dose. This anxiogenic withdrawal response was entirely prevented by the concurrent administration of the calcium channel antagonist, verapamil. No anxiolytic effect of chronic administration of verapamil was observed in vehicle-treated rats. To investigate the possibility that increased calcium function in nerve terminals might underlie diazepam withdrawal-induced anxiety, the uptake by cortical synaptosomes of 45Ca2+ was studied. Both fast (3-sec) and slow (60-sec) phase uptake were measured. No changes in basal (5 mM), potassium-stimulated (55 mM) or net uptake were observed during either fast or slow phase uptake. It is concluded that increased calcium influx in nerve terminals in the cortex does not underlie the anxiogenic effect of withdrawal of the benzodiazepine but that further studies must be carried out in other regions of the brain.", 
    "54": "Recordings of noxious intra-arterial bradykinin (BK)-induced chemonociceptive and spontaneous activity from 30 single spinal lamina V neurones of the dorsal horns in non-anaesthetized and decerebrated rabbits, were performed with tungsten microelectrodes. Intravenous injection of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg; 7 neurones) depressed BK-induced neural discharges by 55.0 +/- 6.2% (P less than 0.05) and 57.9 +/- 8.4% (P less than 0.05) 5 and 25 min after administration, respectively. Treatment with flumazenil (0.2 mg/kg, i.v.; 7 neurones), administered 20 min after midazolam, completely reversed the inhibition by midazolam of the BK-induced spinal lamina V neural responses and spontaneous neuronal activity. In contrast, a large dose of naloxone (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.; 6 neurones), administered 20 min after midazolam, failed to alter the midazolam-induced depressant effects on the nociceptive responses, at the spinal dorsal horn. Treatments with flumazenil (5 neurones) and naloxone (5 neurones) did not influence either the spontaneous or the BK-induced neuronal discharges, recorded in spinal lamina V cells. Midazolam depressed the nociceptive responses probably through its agonistic activity on the binding to the GABA-benzodiazepine-barbiturate system in the spinal dorsal horn.", 
    "55": "Adinazolam (ADI) is a new benzodiazepine with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. To assess its effects on the acute stress response, rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg of ADI and stressed for 1 hr by restraint. Neither dose of ADI had any effect on heart rate, blood pressure or norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EP) in plasma in the resting rats. In the stressed animal, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg of ADI did not affect stress-induced increases in heart rate or blood pressure but both significantly reduced the stress-induced increases in plasma NE and EP. During certain stressful experiences in patients with abnormally-increased sympathetic drive, ADI may be therapeutically useful in reducing high levels of catecholamines.", 
    "56": "One half hour following the ingestion of a possibly tainted antibiotic capsule, a 14 year-old female experienced acute onset of stiffness and weakness in her lower extremities. She subsequently survived despite the development of convulsions, severe lactic acidosis (pH 6.86), hyperthermia (Temp 40.5 degrees C) and rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology testing confirmed the presence of strychnine in blood, gastric aspirate, and urine. Her course, history and outcome are presented and the pharmacokinetics, the mechanism of action, signs and symptoms and treatment of strychnine poisoning are reviewed.", 
    "57": "In situ hybridization was used to study the expression of members of the nerve growth factor family of trophic factors in rat hippocampus following stimulation of afferent cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways with quisqualate. A transient increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and beta-nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA expression in the hippocampus was seen 4 h after a quisqualate injection into the medial septal nucleus. Both BDNF and NGF mRNA levels increased more than 4-fold in the granule layer of the dentate gyrus and for BDNF mRNA also in the pyramidal cells of CA1, while the levels of BDNF mRNA in CA3 increased 2-fold. The increase in BDNF and NGF mRNA levels were completely prevented by pretreatment with systemic injections of either scopolamine or diazepam. A quisqualate injection into the entorhinal cortex, containing glutamatergic afferents to the hippocampus, resulted in a 15-, 5- and 17-fold increase in the expression of BDNF mRNA in the ipsilateral granule cells, CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells, respectively. Similar increases were also seen in the hippocampus contralateral to the injections. In contrast, the level of NGF mRNA did not increase significantly in any of the subfields in the hippocampus. The increase in BDNF mRNA after cortex injections was attenuated by diazepam but not by scopolamine. These findings imply that increased activity in afferent cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways to the hippocampus differentially regulate expression of the NGF family of neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus.", 
    "58": "Severely ill patients often require total parenteral nutrition including intravenous lipid emulsions concurrently administered with lipophilic drugs. Therefore we investigated whether therapeutic application of a mixed medium chain/long chain triglyceride infusion affects the disposition of midazolam necessary for sedation in patients on artificial respiration. The concentrations of midazolam were measured in unfractionated plasma, and in lipoprotein fractions isolated from ex vivo blood samples, including determination of triglycerides and cholesterol; the albumin level was also analysed. Midazolam in the VLDL fraction was only 0.246 microgram.ml-1, whereas the total plasma concentration averaged 1.101 micrograms.ml-1, and the midazolam content of the LDL plus HDL fractions amounted to 1.771 micrograms.ml-1. Albumin in these lipoprotein fractions was just as unequally distributed. A lipid infusion resulted in a significant elevation of total triglycerides from 157 to 221 mg.dl-1 and VLDL-triglycerides from 77 to 155 mg.dl-1. The triglyceride content of the LDL plus HDL fraction rose from 102 to 139 mg.dl-1. At the same time the midazolam concentration in unfractionated plasma and in the VLDL and the LDL + HDL fractions decreased to 0.899 microgram.ml-1, 0.130 micrograms.ml-1, and 1.265 micrograms.ml-1, respectively. Cholesterol and albumin concentrations were not affected. The data show for the first time that a significant increase in plasma triglycerides during an intravenous lipid infusion does not result in accumulation of midazolam in lipoproteins, probably because albumin binding of the drug is very strong. The lack of midazolam trapping is important with respect to the safety of concurrent use of lipophilic drugs and intravenous lipid infusions.", 
    "59": "1. In total 1999 consecutive admissions to six medical wards were subjected to a prospective high-intensity drug event monitoring scheme to assess the extent and pattern of admissions caused by adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or dose related therapeutic failures (TF), in a population-based design. The wards were sub-specialised in general medicine, geriatrics, endocrinology, cardiology, respiratory medicine and gastroenterology. 2. Considering definite, probable and possible drug events, the prevalence of drug related hospital admissions was 11.4% of which 8.4% were caused by ADRs and 3.0% by TFs. There were large inter-department differences. 3. The six classes of drugs most frequently involved in admissions caused by ADRs were anti-rheumatics and analgesics (27%), cardiovascular drugs (23%), psychotropic drugs (14%), anti-diabetics (12%), antibiotics (7%), and corticosteroids (5%). Noncompliance accounted for 66% of the TFs with diuretics and anti-asthmatics most frequently involved. 4. The pattern of drugs involved in ADRs was compared with the regional drug sales statistics. Drugs with a particularly high rate of ADR related admissions per unit dispensed were nitrofurantoin and insulin (617 and 182 admissions per 1,000,000 defined daily doses), while low rates were seen for diuretics and benzodiazepines (10 and 7 admissions per 1,000,000 defined daily doses). Confidence intervals were wide. 5. Patients who had their therapy prescribed by a hospital doctor had a slightly higher prevalence of drug events than those who were treated by a general practitioner (12.6% vs 11.8%). The reverse applied for drug events assessed as avoidable (3.3% vs 4.6%). Although these differences were not statistically significant, it may suggest general practitioners as the appropriate target for interventive measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "The aims of this study were first of all to document a placebo effect on systolic blood pressure and heart rate during mental arithmetic induced stress and secondly to assess the role of suggestion in producing this effect. Two types of placebo were used, a simple placebo and a placebo with an implied therapeutic action. Both were compared with alprazolam. A placebo response was seen in just over half of the volunteers when the cardiovascular changes to mental arithmetic induced stress in healthy volunteers were measured. This response appeared to be unaffected by the suggested therapeutic effect. Dominant, independent subjects, identified using the Cattell 16 PF personality test were less likely to respond to placebo. Alprazolam (0.5 mg) did not prevent, to a significantly greater degree than placebo, the systolic blood pressure or heart rate increases provoked by the mental stress.",

    "65": "The possibility that nerve agents will be used on the battlefield is real. The traditional therapy against nerve agent exposure consists of pyridostigmine pretreatment and atropine-pralidoxime chloride therapy administered after nerve agent exposure. This therapy regimen is extremely effective in preventing mortality in laboratory animals exposed to multilethal concentrations of nerve agent, yet these animals often display convulsions, brain damage, and behavioral incapacitation. We report here that the addition of diazepam to the traditional therapy for nerve agent (soman) exposure not only decreases the incidence of convulsions, but also attenuates the cognitive impairments of rhesus monkeys trained on a Serial Probe Recognition (SPR) task. Monkeys which received diazepam treatment required only 6 days before their performance on the SPR task returned to presoman exposure levels, compared to nondiazepam-treated monkeys which required 15 days. Moreover, only 1 out of the 5 monkeys which received diazepam treatment suffered tonic-clonic convulsions; in contrast all 5 monkeys which did not receive diazepam treatment experienced severe convulsive episodes. These results suggest that diazepam would be an excellent adjunct to traditional nerve agent therapy to facilitate behavioral recovery from nerve agent intoxication that might be encountered by US military personnel on the battlefield or accidental organophosphate poisoning encountered in industrial or agricultural accidents.", 
    "66": "The effect of convulsive stimulation during periods of drug exposure on the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), diazepam (DZP), or sodium valproate (VPA) was studied in three similar experiments. In each experiment, amygdala-kindled rats were assigned to one of three groups: one group received a drug injection (CBZ, 70 mg/kg, IP; DZP, 2 mg/kg, IP; VPA, 250 mg/kg, gavage) 1 h before each of a series of 10 bidaily (one every 48 h) convulsive stimulations, a second group received the same dose of the drug 1 h after each of the 10 stimulations, and a third group served as a vehicle control. The drug tolerance test occurred in each experiment 48 h after the 10th tolerance-development trial; every rat received the appropriate dose of CBZ, DZP, or VPA 1 h before being stimulated. In each experiment, only the rats from the drug-before-stimulation group displayed a significant amount of tolerance to the drug's anticonvulsant effect. Thus the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of CBZ, DZP, and VPA was not an inevitable consequence of drug exposure; the development of tolerance was contingent upon the occurrence of convulsive stimulation during the periods of drug exposure. These results support the idea that functional drug tolerance is an adaptation to a drug's effects on ongoing patterns of neural activity, rather than to drug exposure per se.", 
    "67": "The kindled-convulsion model was used to assess the development of tolerance and cross tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of antiepileptic drugs. In Experiment 1, tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant effects of bidaily (one every 48 h) IP injections of phenobarbital, trimethadione, and clonazepam on convulsions elicited 1 h after each injection in kindled rats by amygdala stimulation. In Experiment 2, kindled rats that were tolerant to the anticonvulsant effects of phenobarbital, trimethadione, or clonazepam received bidaily IP injections of carbamazepine, each followed 1 h later by a convulsive amygdala stimulation. There was a statistically significant transfer of tolerance from phenobarbital to carbamazepine, but not from either trimethadione or clonazepam to carbamazepine. Apparently, tolerance to anticonvulsant drugs is most likely to transfer between drugs that are effective against similar kinds of clinical and experimental seizures and have similar putative mechanisms of action.", 
    "68": "We assessed the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), diazepam (DZP), and sodium valproate (VPA) on convulsions elicited by amygdala stimulation in kindled rats in three similar experiments. In each experiment, amygdala-kindled rats were assigned to a drug group or to a corresponding vehicle control group. The rats in the three drug groups received a total of 10 bidaily (one every 48 h) IP injections of CBZ (70 mg/kg), DZP (2 mg/kg) or VPA (250 mg/kg) at a dose that initially blocked the forelimb clonus elicited by an amygdala stimulation (400 microA, 60 Hz, 1 s) administered 1 h after the injection. The rats in the three vehicle control groups were similarly treated except that they received injections of the saline vehicle. The drug tolerance test occurred 48 h after the final tolerance-development trial; the rats from each drug group and the corresponding vehicle control group received an injection of the appropriate drug followed 1 h later by the administration of a convulsive stimulation. The drug tolerance test revealed almost total tolerance in each of the three drug groups but no tolerance in any of the three vehicle control groups. Such large tolerance effects are inconsistent with the less dramatic effects reported in previous studies; possible reasons for this inconsistency were considered.", 
    "69": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the efficacy and safety of alprazolam was investigated in childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders. Thirty patients (mean, 12.6 years) diagnosed with overanxious or avoidant disorders participated in the study. Evaluations included clinical, laboratory, cognitive, and qualitative EEG measurements. On a clinical global rating, there was no statistical difference between alprazolam and placebo. Relative to baseline EEG, acute alprazolam administration increased beta power in the right occipital lead, and chronic administration increased beta power in both leads. Alprazolam was well tolerated, and adverse effects were few, mild, and transient.", 
    "70": "This study reports results from experiments designed to test common, clinically useful anti-convulsants for their effectiveness, if any, against the high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) in rats. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, or diazepam were administered orally to rats before compression. Endpoints used to assess the progression of the HPNS were T1, T3, and T5 (onset of, continuous, and severe tremor), myoclonus, and seizures. Of the four drugs tested, only phenobarbitone increased the onset pressure for tremor and seizures by: T1 33%; T3 11%; T5 14%; seizures 10%. Neither phenytoin, carbamazepine, nor diazepam had any significant effect on any of the endpoints studied. High dose chronic pretreatment with phenytoin also had no effect on the HPNS. These data suggest that conventional anticonvulsant treatment would be of limited value for HPNS in man, and the lack of effect also suggests that HPNS seizures are of an unusual type.", 
    "71": "This paper describes a prospective, double blind, randomised and dummy-controlled trial in 28 patients with chronic mechanical low back pain presenting to the York Pain Clinic. The therapeutic effects of epidural methyl prednisolone (80 mg) were compared with intrathecal midazolam (2 mg). All the patients had pain for a considerable length of time (range: 1-35 years) and all had received previous treatments which had failed. The two groups of patients were comparable in terms of pain duration, demography, extent of disability, anxiety and depression and pain locus of control. The pain was assessed before and for 2 months after treatment using the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire as well as visual analogue and verbal rating scales for sensory and affective components of their pain experience; patients also completed a pain diary. Both treatments caused a similar improvement in one-half to three-quarters of the patients for 2 months in patterns of activity and sleep as well as in the sensory and affective components of the pain. However, although the improvement in the two groups was similar, all the patients treated with steroid were either taking more or the same amount of self-administered analgesic medication after their treatment, whereas between one-third and one-half of the midazolam-treated patients took less medication during the 2 month follow-up period. We conclude that intrathecal midazolam is an effective treatment for chronic mechanical low back pain. The mechanism responsible for this effect is discussed.", 
    "72": "The following study explores the possibility that zolpidem, a new hypnotic agent derived from imidopyridine, may induce changes in ventilatory function in normal subjects. The study, conducted double-blind on 16 subjects (eight men and eight women, aged 21 to 33 years) was undertaken in two successive phases: phase A with a cross-over, intended to compare the ventilatory effects of 10 mg oral dose of diazepam with a placebo, and then phase B, with a Latin square design, intended to compare the effects of 10 and 20 mg oral doses of zolpidem with 10 mg oral doses of diazepam and a placebo. Central inspiratory drive was assessed by occlusion pressure (P0.1) and breathing pattern in air and during carbon dioxide rebreathing. Measurements were performed one and three hours after each drug or placebo administration. Zolpidem did not affect tidal volume (Vt), slopes S1, S2 or P0.1, but decreased the duration of the phases of the respiratory cycle ti by 14% (p less than 0.01) and ttot by 15% (p = 0.03) after three hours post dosing without any change in ventilation, Vt/ti or ti/ttot. Nevertheless, these timing changes, although statistically significant, seem to have no clinical relevance to overall ventilation regulation in normal subjects. On the other hand, diazepam slightly changed S2 at three hours post dosing (0.14 +/- 0.07 versus 0.17 +/- 0.10 after the placebo; p = 0.06) without modifying the other parameters.", 
    "73": "This study was undertaken to determine the dosages, treatment times and side effects of ketamine HCI with and without two benzodiazepines when used for sedation on a group of precooperative children at the UCLA Children's Dental Center. Ketamine was evaluated when used alone, and in conjunction with two benzodiazepines, diazepam or a new water-soluble midazolam. An anti-muscarinic, atropine or glycopyrrolate, and nitrous oxide-oxygen were included in all sedations. Mean treatment times were increased significantly when ketamine and a benzodiazepine were used in combination. Additionally, mean ketamine dosages were decreased significantly when ketamine was utilized in combination with a benzodiazepine. All children tolerated the sedation well and there were no severe adverse reactions. Side effects included nausea, vomiting, and a rise in post-operative temperatures.", 
    "74": "The effects of two benzodiazepines, diazepam (15 or 20 mg orally) and lorazepam (1.75 or 2.5 mg orally), and a placebo on explicit memory, lexical priming and perceptual priming were assessed using a free-recall, a word-completion and a picture-completion test. The picture-completion test included two different study conditions intended to manipulate the magnitude of the priming effect. Sixty healthy volunteers took part in this double-blind study. Free-recall performances were altered by both drugs. Lorazepam impaired word-completion and picture-completion performance, whereas diazepam only exhibited a deleterious effect on the more sensitive of the two measures of the picture-completion test. These results indicate that the two benzodiazepines have differential amnestic effects. It is suggested that these differential effects could be accounted for by a different cortical distribution of the two benzodiazepines.", 
    "75": "To assess the influence of neuroleptics on explicit memory and two forms of implicit memory, repetition priming and cognitive skill learning, the effects of two low doses of chlorpromazine (12.5 and 25 mg orally) were contrasted to those of lorazepam (2.5 mg orally) and of a placebo using a free-recall task, a word-completion task and repeated testing on the Tower of Toronto puzzle, a version of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Seventy-two healthy volunteers took part in this double-blind study. Chlorpromazine spared free-recall and word-completion performance, but impaired the acquisition of a cognitive routine in the subjects who completed the first trials of the Tower of Toronto puzzle efficiently. Lorazepam induced an opposite pattern of memory disruption. These preliminary results suggest that chlorpromazine and lorazepam induced a double dissociation between priming and the acquisition of a cognitive routine. They provide evidence that the two forms of implicit memory rely upon distinct neurochemical systems, the latter, but not the former, being dependent upon dopaminergic systems.", 
    "76": "Administration of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (mCPB), a 5-HT3 receptor agonist (1 and 10 mg/kg IP), was found to be significantly anxiogenic in vehicle treated rats tested in the plus-maze, while having no significant effect in rats withdrawn for 24 h from 21 days diazepam treatment (2 mg/kg/day), suggesting a decreased agonist action at 5-HT3 receptors following withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment. In the social interaction test, diazepam withdrawn rats showed a significant decrease in social interaction when compared to the chronic vehicle treated group. This anxiogenic response was reversed by low doses of zacopride (0.0001-0.01 mg/kg IP); in the vehicle treated animals 0.1 mg/kg was significantly anxiogenic. The overall pattern of results with zacopride is explained by suggesting that the anxiogenic effects of high doses of zacopride are detectable at low levels of 5-HT function and are due to an agonist action of the S-isomer in the rat at 5-HT3 receptors. The anxiolytic action of low doses is attributed to the R-isomer acting at the R-zacopride binding site and is enhanced in conditions of high 5-HT function, e.g. in the diazepam withdrawn rats. If this hypothesis is correct, then we would predict the R-isomer alone would be more effective in reversing the anxiogenic effects of diazepam withdrawal than the racemate, used here.", 
    "77": "Reinforcing and physical dependence-producing effects of oral diazepam and triazolam (0.01-1.28 mg/ml) were studied in four non-water-deprived baboons in daily 2-3-h sessions. Drinking initially was food-induced, but subsequently it was maintained for greater than year without the inducing procedures; drug intake greater than 10 mg/kg per session was attained. Triazolam and diazepam reinforcement (compared to vehicle) was concluded for only one baboon for each drug under a single-spout procedure and for two baboons for each drug under a two-spout procedure. However, all baboons showed ethanol reinforcement under a two-spout procedure. When a lever-pressing requirement was imposed for each drink (one-spout procedure), ethanol maintained requirements of 128 or 256 responses/drink, and volume of ethanol consumed was greater than vehicle. Neither benzodiazepine maintained lever pressing better than vehicle at any response requirement and drinking was suppressed by requirements of 1-32. Physical dependence to triazolam and diazepam developed after approximately 1 month of daily ingestion, evidenced by a precipitated withdrawal syndrome after injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. A mild spontaneous withdrawal syndrome occurred after substitution of vehicle for triazolam or diazepam. These data indicate a clear dissociation between the reinforcing and physical dependence-producing effects of triazolam and diazepam.", 
    "78": "The effects of ritanserin, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptor antagonist, and chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine agonist, on sleep-wakefulness disturbances in rats after acute administration of cocaine and after discontinuation of chronic cocaine treatment were examined. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) but not ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg) prevented the increase of wakefulness (W) and the reduction of light slow wave sleep (SWS1) and deep slow wave sleep (SWS2) induced by an acute injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg IP). Daily injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg for 5 days, then 30 mg/kg for 5 days IP) at the onset of the light phase elicited an increase of W and a concomitant decrease of SWS1, SWS2 and paradoxical sleep (PS) in the light phase, followed by a rebound in SWS2 and PS in the subsequent dark phase. Following cocaine discontinuation, the circadian distribution of sleep-wakefulness states remained disturbed in saline-treated rats for at least 5 days. Both ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg IP/day) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg IP/day) reduced the alteration in the distribution of W and SWS2 throughout the light-dark cycle from the first day of administration on, but failed to prevent PS alterations. The mechanisms by which both compounds exert their effect are probably quite different. For chlordiazepoxide sedative and sleep-inducing properties probably play a major role. In contrast, for ritanserin SWS2-increasing properties and its ability to reverse preference for drugs of abuse without inducing aversion might be key factors.", 
    "79": "The prescription of hypnotics, mostly benzodiazepines, continues at a high level. One problem with their use is rebound insomnia: upon discontinuation sleep worsens compared with pretreatment levels. Factors influencing rebound include the type of subject, the duration of action of the hypnotic, the dosage and perhaps duration of treatment. The detection of rebound requires both sleep-laboratory and clinical studies with night-by-night analyses of individual patient data. This review concentrates on the newer compounds, (quazepam and zolpidem) which act selectively on subtypes of benzodiazepine receptors or bind atypically (zopiclone). It concludes that present evidence, while limited, is consistent with claims of less rebound potential than older benzodiazepine hypnotics of equivalent duration of action. Nevertheless, further rigorous studies are essential before these claims can be totally accepted.", 
    "80": "The purpose of the paper was to compare the performance of ETS (EMIT) and ADx (FPIA) analyzers for screening blood samples for drugs of abuse after 2 alternative pretreatment procedures (acetone precipitation and ultrafiltration). Cannabinoids, benzodiazepines and benzoylecgonine were not detectable with both assays after ultrafiltration. The detectability of morphine in blood ultrafiltrates was distinctly lower than after acetone precipitation. The comparison of results obtained with ETS and ADx after acetone precipitation showed that ETS assay is slightly more sensitive but ADx is slightly more reproducible. Both assays may be used for blood examination with similar cut-off values. The ETS analyzer gave much better analytical performance (speed, flexibility) and lower reagent costs than the ADx analyzer.", 
    "81": "A rapid and quantitative method for the determination of benzodiazepines using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode-array detection (DAD) is reported. The drugs were extracted from serum, blood or post-mortem blood using C18 extraction columns. Brotizolam was used as internal standard. Experiments with spiked serum/blood samples resulted in recoveries between 75% and 94% for all investigated benzodiazepines. Excellent linearity was obtained over the concentration range 5-1500 ng benzodiazepine/ml. The limit of detection was approximately 2 ng/ml. The detection of low therapeutic serum levels of highly potent benzodiazepines is also possible.", 
    "82": "Studies were carried out on the ability of some anesthetic agents (Propofol, Dormicum, Ketalar and Penthotal) to induce the release of cytokines by human monocytes and lymphocytes in vitro. All anesthetic agents tested at hematic concentrations reached during anesthetic administration cause an increase in the production of Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from human monocytes; the increase is 4-5 times greater than controls. The greatest Interleukin -1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) production increase was induced by Propofol. The release of Interleukin -6 (IL-6) is notably increased by Ketalar (about 10 times greater than controls). In the presence of different anesthetic agents, human lymphocytes release Interleukin -4 (IL-4) and Interferon gamma- (IFN-gamma). Penthotal and Ketalar increase IL-4 production which appears quite high compared to that obtained with Con A used as standard challenge. Propofol induce IL-4 release which is about the same as that seen with Con A. IFN-gamma is released in high quantities by lymphocytes treated with Propofol. Dormicum, Ketalar and Penthotal induce non-significant increase of IFN-gamma release. The results concern the choice of anesthetic, in relation to its action on host immune response. This aspect is particularly interesting in immunocompromised host.", 
    "83": "We gave 12 healthy male volunteers 1 mg of alprazolam or placebo on three occasions after a standard breakfast in a double-blind, randomized, single-dose, three-way crossover study. The three trials were: (a) oral alprazolam and sublingual placebo; (b) oral placebo and sublingual alprazolam; (c) placebo by both routes. Plasma alprazolam concentrations during 24 h after each dose were measured by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. Peak plasma concentrations were reached later after sublingual than oral dosage (2.8 vs 1.8 h, P less than 0.01). Other kinetic variables were not significantly different: peak plasma concentration, 11.3 vs 12.0 ng.ml-1; elimination half-life, 12.5 vs 11.7 h; and total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, 197 vs 186 h.ng.ml-1. Pharmacodynamic measures showed that sublingual and oral alprazolam both produced sedation, fatigue, impaired digit symbol substitution, slowing of reaction time, and impairment of the acquisition and recall of information. These changes were initially observed at 0.5 h after dosage and lasted up to 8 h. In general the two routes were significantly different from placebo but not from each other.", 
    "84": "A case is reported of a 23 year old man who sustained a central anticholinergic syndrome after undergoing upper limb surgery under regional anaesthesia and sedation with 2 mg midazolam and 75 micrograms fentanyl. The disturbances consisted of excitation and inhibition. On the 4th postoperative day, he developed progressive coma, quickly and totally reversed with 2 mg physostigmine. Chronic benzodiazepine therapy seems to be a facilitating factor of central anticholinergic syndrome. The low rate of this postoperative complication seems to proceed from failure to recognize it. Differential diagnosis and place of physostigmine therapy are discussed.", 
    "85": "Delirium tremens is linked with a chronic depression of the central nervous system by alcohol and a compensatory hyperactivity of neurotransmitters. A sudden stoppage of alcohol intake induces excessive production of these transmitters. Firstly appearing is a noradrenergic hyperactivity which may be responsible not only for reducing the magnesium blood level but also for activating the other transmitter systems. A magnesium blood level lower than 1 mmol.l-1 involves a risk of seizures and requires IV magnesium sulfate. Noradrenergic hyperactivity can be prevented by IV alcohol associated with sedation best achieved by IV clomethiazole in alcoholic solution. Should these preventive measures fail, noradrenaline action in the central nervous system can be blocked by clonidine. Should hallucinations become manifest, linked to dopaminergic hyperactivity, haloperidol is indicated. Benzodiazepines may be useful, particularly carbamazepine, for their depressing effect on gaba-ergic hyperactivity.", 
    "86": "Midazolam presents the properties of a good premedication because of its sedative and anxiolytic activity. The aim of this study, concerning 84 children, was to compare the efficacy of midazolam according to the three ways of administration: intrarectal, oral and intranasal, in reference to a group without premedication. Results have shown the superiority of intrarectal midazolam at the dose of 0.35 mg.kg-1 30 minutes before surgery. The tolerance of this way of administration is excellent and it allows a greater sedative activity compared to the control group and to the intranasal group.", 
    "87": "Data concerning 331 subjects participating in a longitudinal study on anxiety disorders were collected over the first 6 months of the study. Preliminary analyses of somatic treatment according to diagnoses and study site were conducted. The comorbidity of one anxiety disorder with other DSM-III-R diagnoses and other types of anxiety disorders was extensive. Patients with panic disorder received significantly more treatment with a benzodiazepine than patients without panic disorder. Fewer than five percent of the sample were treated with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Comorbid depression increased the likelihood of treatment with a newer non-MAOI (non-monoamine oxidase inhibitor), nontricyclic antidepressant. Results suggest a strong effect of treatment site on the pharmacotherapy offered.", 
    "88": "The anticonvulsant effects of propofol, thiopental, and diazepam, administered intravenously, on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure threshold were studied and compared in the rabbit. The PTZ seizure threshold determined in various rabbit groups during the control phase of conducted experiments, was found to be in the range of 10.1 +/- 2.0 to 13.5 +/- 3.7 mg/kg. Intravenous administration of comparable doses of propofol, thiopental, and diazepam resulted in marked and significant increases in PTZ seizure threshold. At all administered doses (1.25-10.0 mg/kg), propofol was found to be more effective than thiopental in increasing the PTZ threshold dose. However, the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam were more marked than those of propofol, except at a dose of 10 mg/kg where both agents exhibited equipotent activities. These data demonstrate that propofol enjoys a considerable degree of anticonvulsant activity in the rabbit. This anticonvulsant action is greater than that of thiopental at doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg and equipotent with diazepam at the 10 mg/kg dose.", 
    "89": "In an experimental condition of hyperthyroidism, obtained by repeated administration of triiodothyronine in adult rats (100 micrograms/kg/day, sc for 7 consecutive days), there is an increased susceptibility to the convulsant effect of isoniazid (300 mg/kg, ip) and picrotoxin (4 mg/kg, ip). On the other hand, the characteristics of brain [3H] flunitrazepam binding sites are not modified. These data afford further experimental evidence of the influence of thyroid hormones on brain function.", 
    "90": "In order to determine whether temporal factors impact on drugs of abuse and overdose presentations to an urban emergency department, we studied the records of 630 consecutive drug overdose presentations over a period from October 1987 to March 1990. Particular note was made of the time of day of presentation along with the nature of the drug(s) ingested. A significant curve (p less than 0.0005) was obtained for a 24 h period with a peak time of presentation being 6:32 pm (95% confidence interval of 1 h 54 min). Significant periodic rhythms were noted for cocaine, opiates, alcohol, analgesics, marijuana, and benzodiazepines. A 4.8 h periodic rhythm was demonstrated for cocaine, marijuana and alcohol-in-combination. We conclude that the emergency department should be most prepared to treat the drug overdose patient in the early evening and emergency department staffing should reflect this peak in demand.", 
    "91": "We have selected a strain of rats and designated it the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). In this strain, 100% of the animals present recurrent generalized non-convulsive seizures characterized by bilateral and synchronous spike-and-wave discharges accompanied with behavioural arrest, staring and sometimes twitching of the vibrissae. Spontaneous SWD (7-11 cps, 300-1,000 microV, 0.5-75 sec) start and end abruptly on a normal background EEG. They usually occur at a mean frequency of 1.5 per min when the animals are in a state of quiet wakefulness. Drugs effective against absence seizures in humans (ethosuccimide, trimethadione, valproate, benzodiazepines) suppress the SWD dose-dependently, whereas drugs specific for convulsive or focal seizures (carbamazepine, phenytoin) are ineffective. SWD are increased by epileptogenic drugs inducing petit mal-like seizures, such as pentylenetetrazol, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, THIP and penicillin. Depth EEG recordings and lesion experiments show that SWD in GAERs depend on cortical and thalamic structures with a possible rhythmic triggering by the lateral thalamus. Most neurotransmitters are involved in the control of SWD (dopamine, noradrenaline, NMDA, acetylcholine), but GABA and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) seem to play a critical role. SWD are genetically determined with an autosomal dominant inheritance. The variable expression of SWD in offsprings from GAERS x control reciprocal crosses may be due to the existence of multiple genes. Neurophysiological, behavioural, pharmacological and genetic studies demonstrate that spontaneous SWD in GAERS fulfill all the requirements for an experimental model of absence epilepsy. As the mechanisms underlying absence epilepsy in humans are still unknown, the analysis of the genetic thalamocortical dysfunction in GAERS may be fruitful in investigations of the pathogenesis of generalized non-convulsive seizures.", 
    "92": "The intracellular localization of two neurotropic drugs, flunitrazepam (benzodiazepine) and triflupromazine (phenothiazine), was studied by secondary ion mass spectrometry microscopy (SIMS) in three varieties of cells. The images of the intracellular distributions of the two drugs are easily obtained by selecting the fluorine atom of the molecules. These images show that the drug from the benzodiazepine group is mainly located in the nuclei, whereas the phenothiazine is exclusively located inside the cytoplasm."
