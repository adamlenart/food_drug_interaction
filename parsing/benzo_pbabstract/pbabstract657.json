    "0": "Neurological complications due to anticonvulsive treatment was analyzed in 48 epileptic patients. It is demonstrated that there is a changed structure and increased frequency of epileptic paroxysms in appearance of neurological complications. Special attention is drawn to the significance of residual signs in organic diseases and to their occurrence. Recommendations are given for prevention and treatment of complications.", 
    "1": "The actions of diazepam and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) were assessed on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of male Wistar rats. One and 2 mg/kg diazepam and 12.5 mg/kg GHB had no effects on the sleep variables. After 25 mg/kg GHB, slow wave sleep (SWS2) was significantly increased. Following the combined administration of non-effective doses of GHB and diazepam, significantly higher amounts of SWS2 at the expense of wakefulness were obtained. The injection of a subconvulsant dose of bicuculline (2.5 mg/kg) prior to treatments which significantly increased SWS2 prevented this effect to show up. It is suggested that the actions of GHB and diazepam on the sleep-awake cycle are related to the same neurotransmitter system.", 
    "2": "Thirty cases of intractable epilepsy in children were investigated to observe the correlation between the suppression of seizure discharges to intravenous diazepam and the type of seizure or effects of subsequent therapy. Suppression of seizure discharges were bilaterally poor in 75% of the cases with infantile spasms and 89% of cases with Lennox syndrome and other generalized seizures while it was unilaterally poor in 80% of the cases with focal or unilateral seizures. ACTH or steroid therapy was clinically and electroencephalographically effective in 80% of the cases with good suppression responses and in none of cases with good suppression that was resistant to the therapy. On the other hand, clinical seizures were not controlled in 73% of the cases showing poor suppression and EEG did not reveal improvement in 82% of the cases with poor suppression. EEG with intravenous diazepam is valuable for understanding the pharmacophysiological mechanism of epilepsy and it may be possible to select cases as candidates for ACTH or steroid therapy using this technique.", 
    "3": "Levomepromazine, chlorpromazine (10 and 30 mg/kg), etaperaxine, haloperidol (3 and 10 mg/kg) inhibited the exploratory-motor reactions of rats and the brain Na, K-ATPase activity an hour after their administration. The effects of tranquilizers as well as of antidepressants on the exploratory reactions and on the enzyme activity were not found to stand in a clearcut relation to each other. The stimulating effect of amphethamine (3 mg/kg) was accompanied by activation and suppressive action (10 mg/kg)--by inhibition of the enzyme. It is suggested that the inhibition of the brain Na, K-ATPase activity by psychotropic drugs may play a role in the mechanism of their sedative action.", 
    "4": "Sodium valproate and clonazepam were given in combination to 17 refractory epileptic patients and their progress was reviewed clinically and by EEG's. Even though plasma concentrations of sodium valproate and conventional anticonvulsants were monitored and adjusted according to individual requirements, combination therapy consisting of valproate and clonazepam was ineffective in controlling seizures in the majority of patients. A further 40 patients receiving clonazepam were reviewed in relation to adverse reactions. 22 patients in this group suffered from undesirable effects attributable to clonazepam. These effects were managed by cessation of the drug or a reduction in the dose. The commonest side effects were drowsiness, loss of concentration, irritability and aggression.", 
    "5": "Spontaneous locomotor activity has been studied in mice treated with single or repeated doses (five daily injections) of chlordiazepoxide. The repeated administration enhanced the stimulatory action of the lower doses of the drug, while the depressant effect of the higher doses was reduced.", 
    "6": "Comparable rates and patterns of lever-pressing by rats were obtained under a multiple variable interval schedule of food reinforcement and continuous shock avoidance. Chlordiazepoxide (1.0--17.0 mg/kg) produced increases in food maintained responding at doses that decreased avoidance responding. Removing food, shock, or both in separate individual probe sessions did not produce differential effects. Under certain circumstances, the effects of chlordiazepoxide appear to be best predicted by knowledge of maintaining conditions.", 
    "7": "Neurophysiological, biochemical and histochemical analyses have indicated a heterogeneous distribution of the GABA-ergic system in mammalian brain. The poor correlation between the regional distributions of presynaptic markers and synaptic receptors for GABA suggests that it is impossible to predict the functional importance of this neurotransmitter system in any particular brain region using either pre- or post-synaptic determinations alone. The possibility that the receptor affinity for GABA may vary significantly among different brain regions suggests that this may be another mechanism whereby the brain regulates the activity level of this transmitter system. Thus, in any given brain region, the storage and uptake capacities for GABA, the rates of its synthesis and release, and the number and affinity of GABA receptor recognition sites can all play a role in regulating GABA-ergic tone. Subtle alterations in any one or more of these parameters can lead to dysfunction, whose manifestation will depend upon the brain region involved. Regional distribution studies can also yield insights into the possible mechanisms of action of centrally-active drugs. Thus, a significant correlation between the regional distribution of a neurotransmitter receptor and a particular class of drug provides circumstantial evidence that the drug interacts with this receptor site. Such a situation appears to exist for the benzodiazepines and the GABA-receptor.", 
    "8": "Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described. Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam. The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha coma', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG. The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range. All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents. The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed. It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo-thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma. It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication, in the absence of significant hypoxaemia, a favourable outcome may be anticipated.", 
    "9": "Benzodiazepine derivatives are the most commonly prescribed anti-anxiety agents in clinical practice. Six benzodiazepine anxiolytics are now available in the United States. Additional drugs are used in other parts of the world, and many others are in various stages of clinical testing. All these benzodiazepine derivatives have similar neuropharmacological properties--they reduce anxiety, produce sedation and sleep, have anticonvulsant effects, and can produce muscle relaxation. Faced with this bewildering array of drugs from the same class which are very similar in intrinsic effects upon the brain, the clinician may well ask how best to make a rational choice among the available derivatives. Despite neuropharmacological similarities, there are differences among benzodiazepines in patterns of absorption, distribution, and elimination by the human body. These pharmacokinetic differences may in turn lead to apparent differences in clinical action. This review summarizes pertinent pharmacokinetic characteristics of benzodiazepine anti-anxiety agents.", 
    "10": "The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the new benzodiazepine lormetazepam were investigated in five male volunteers using the 14C-labelled drug (position 5). Lormetazepam was administered intravenously and orally, at a dose of 0.2 and 2 mg respectively, to each of the test subjects. Measurements of total radioactivity showed that the drug was absorbed completely and eliminated almost exclusively by the renal route. Maximum plasma level of active ingredient and total radioactivity were observed about 2 hours and 5 hours following oral administration. As early as 30 min following oral administration, concentration of active ingredient amounted to 80% of the maximum values. After both treatments the terminal half-life of total radioactivity and lormetazepam glucuronide in plasma corresponded to the half-life of elimination in urine of about 13 hours. After enzymatic hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulphatase, an average of 90% of total radioactivity from various urine and plasma samples was extractable with ether. Extracts from plasma contained only unchanged drug, indicating free and conjugated lormetazepam as ingredients of total radioactivity. Extracts from urine could be separated into lormetazepam and its N-demethylation derivative lorazepam. The relative amount of excreted lorazepam conjugate was demonstrated to be time-dependent, probably due to enterohepatic circulation. Since less than 6% of the total dose was demethylated by both routes of administration, it can be assumed that lormetazepam is the active product.", 
    "11": "In a double-blind cross-over study using normal student volunteers, the effects of 1 and 2.5 mg lorazepam on self-rated mood and bodily symptoms, as well as performance in a number of tests were assessed. Both doses significantly increased self ratings of physical and mental sedation, the effects being more marked 4 h after drug administration than after 1 h. Lorazepam impaired simple reaction time, verbal learning, number cancellation, symbol copying and performance in the digit-symbol substitution test. The impairments were greater with the 2.5 mg dose and were more marked 4 h after drug administration than after 1 h.", 
    "12": "Plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) and intensity of self-rated sedation (SRS) were measured at multiple points in time during 6 h after a single 15 mg oral dose of clorazepate dipotassium. Mean plasma DMDZ levels and mean SRS scores both became maximal at 1.0--2.5 h after drug dosage. By 6 h, however, mean SRS had returned to the predrug baseline score while mean DMDZ concentration fell only slighty from the maximum value. Disappearance of SRS despite persistence of high DMDZ levels might be due to adaptation or tolerance. If this is the case, subjective effects of benzodiazepines may depend upon duration of drug exposure as well as dose and concentration.", 
    "13": "The pharmacokinetic properties of estazolam, a triazolo benzodiazepine hypnotic agent, were assessed in a series of healthy volunteers following single and multiple doses. After single oral doses of 2--16 mg, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 6 h. Values of elimination half-life ranged from 8.3--31.2 h (mean 17.0 h) and did not vary significantly with dose. During 3 weeks of therapy, steady-state plasma concentrations increased approximately in proportion to increasing doses. and accumulation was essentially complete within 3 days of each dose change. The mean observed accumulation ratio was 1.84, which was slightly larger than the predicted ratio of 1.53. Exposure to multiple-dose estazolam therapy had no significant influence on the kinetics of a single dose of antipyrine, suggesting that estazolam neither stimulates nor inhibits enzyme activity in humans. Thus the accumulation and elimination kinetics of estazolam can be classified as intermediate to those of the short-acting (such as oxazepam) and the long-acting (such as diazepam) benzodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "14": "The effects of some typical clinically tested psychotropic drugs were studied in acute experiments on awake rats. Potentials in somatosensory cortex were evoked by peripheral stimulation. Haloperidol, diazepam, medazepam, desipramin and a new substance, the MPP-sulton, caused significant modification in latency and amplitude of some components of the potentials. Between the effects of psychotropic drugs exist differences which, in turn, were clearly distinguishable from the modification of these evoked responses by unspecific narcotic effects of hexobarbital.", 
    "15": "A sleep laboratory hypnotic drug evaluation study was conducted in which 2 mg flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine with a half life of intermediate duration, was administered nightly to 6 insomniac subjects for 4 consecutive weeks. The drug was effective with short-term use. However, tolerance developed for sleep maintenance during the intermediate- and long-term drug administration periods. Following drug withdrawal, a significant worsening of sleep above baseline levels occurred. These data are consistent with our previous findings of rebound insomnia following withdrawal of short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines.", 
    "16": "A double-blind study with 40 healthy students was done in order to measure the effects of a 2-week treatment with chloridiazepoxide lactam (5 mg), nordiazepam (10 mg), oxazepam (15 mg) and methyloxazepam (20 mg) on immediate memory and associative learning. The drugs were administered t.i.d. and the tests were done after the very last capsule was given. It was ingested with a placebo drink and 0.5 g alcohol/kg body weight. Oxazepam and methyloxazepam alone behaved similar to the placebo. Immediate memory was significantly impaired following the treatment with nordiazepam, chlordiazepoxide lactam, alcohol, and after the simultaneous administration of nordiazepam and chlordiazepoxide lactam with alcohol. Chlordiazepoxide lactam was the only drug which alone impaired associative learning. Also alcohol alone, and all the drugs in combination with alcohol retarded learning acquisition.", 
    "17": "The present study evaluated the efficacy of 25 mg of quazepam, a new benzodiazepine hypnotic, in a population of chronic insomniacs. The results indicate that a single dose (25 mg) administered for one night was efficacious when measured both objectively by polysomnographic recording and subjectively by questionnaire with no reported side-effects. The change in the objective measures paralleled the direction of change in subjective measures. Sleep efficiency and sleep maintenance were improved without EEG changes in Stages 2, 3-4, and REM. Further study is needed to evaluate the effects of chronic administration of different doses of quazepam in chronic insomniacs.", 
    "18": "The efficacy of psychopharmacological treatment modalities and comatose methods was studied in the therapy of patients with slowly progressive schizophrenia, the clinical picture of which was characterized by cenestho-hypochondriacal disturbances (155 cases). The use of high doses of neuroleptics, atropine and insulin comas in these cases were ineffective. A positive compliance to therapy was attained in the treatment by tranquilizers of the benzodiazepine series, especially by a parenteral administration. The best results were demonstrated in the treatment of pseudoneurotic hypochondria. The therapeutic reluctancy increased in the cenestho-algic syndrome and in the syndrome of \"rigid\" hypochondria. The most effective in these cases was a combined therapy by tranquilizers (parenteral administration) and small doses of neuroleptics.", 
    "19": "1 The efficacy and safety of temazepam 30 mg, compared with glutethimide 500 mg and placebo, were evaluated in double-blind conditions in a 4-day study in 75 outpatients with a history of insomnia. 2 Temazepam and glutethimide were rated by the patients as effective and significantly superior to placebo for general quality of sleep, time required to fall asleep, frequency of nocturnal and early morning awakenings, and duration of sleep. 3 Residual effects reported for temazepam and glutethimide immediately after awakening and during the day were similar to or less than those reported for placebo.", 
    "20": "1 In the management of insomnia with drugs, any action should be restricted to the duration of the night and residual effects should be absent during the day-time. The intermittent type of drug action desired is fundamentally different from drug treatment where a constant effect is sought. 2 Duration of drug action is dependent on the kinetics of distribution and elimination of the parent drug and its effective metabolites. In addition biopharmaceutical factors, such as those which promote a rapid rate of absorption, are important. 3 These considerations serve as a guide for a review of the kinetics and metabolism of various benzodiazepines.", 
    "21": "1 Efficacy of temazepam 30 mg at night as an hypnotic was compared with placebo in 55 out-patients with insomnia. The study was double blind, with two comparable groups of patients established by random allocation. Placebo and medication were taken for 4 consecutive nights and sleep questionnaires were completed the next day. 2 Patients reported that temazepam was more effective than placebo in reducing the difficulty of falling asleep and improving sleep maintenance. They also indicated that they awoke less and were less disturbed by early morning awakenings reported as a group that the average duration of sleep was increased by 1 hour. 3 The patients receiving temazepam reported being more alert in the morning and for the entire day than with placebo.", 
    "22": "1 Temazepam was evaluated in a strictly defined insomniac patient population under sleep laboratory conditions. Two protocols were used: a short-term (26-night) and a long-term (54-night) protocol evaluated the efficacy of the drug administered at night at 15 mg (short-term study) and 30 mg (long-term study), respectively. 2 Temazepam seemed to be both safe and effective at doses of 15 and 30 mg with up to 5 weeks of ingestion. 3 Suppression of slow wave sleep was observed at the high dose, but no suppression of REM sleep, found in studies with other benzodiazepines, was noted. 4 No evidence was found for development of tolerance or rebound effects.", 
    "23": "1 The effect of temazepam 15 and 30 mg, flurazepam 15 and 30 mg, quinalbarbitone 100 and 200 mg and placebo were studied in 14 healthy male volunteers according to a Latin-square design. At 14-d intervals subjects received capsules 30 min before bedtime on 2 consecutive nights and were evaluated for objective sleep characteristics, for morning estimates of sleep characteristics, and for cognitive and psychomotive performance and subjective state at 3.5, 10.0 and 22.5 h after ingestion. 2 Changes in sleep induction and sleep maintenance were observed with temazepam 30 mg and flurazepam 30 mg had the greater effect on cognitive performance, whereas quinalbarbitone 20 mg had the greater effect on psychomotive performance. Subjective assessments of alertness were most affected by flurazepam, and by quinalbarbitone 200 mg. 4 The results suggest that temazepam produces less residual effects and is shorter acting than quinalbarbitone and flurazepam.", 
    "24": "1 Healthy volunteers received single doses of temazepam 30 mg in conventional gelatin capsules, suppositories or in solution. They experienced marked sedation and sleepiness. The onset of sleepiness was prompt after the administration of the solution; this latter showed the fastest absorption and gave the highest peak plasma levels. This observation led to the development of the soft gelatin capsule. 2 To assess bioavailability of the formulation, plasma levels of temazepam were determined in healthy volunteers after single oral administration of soft and hard capsules, and after seven consecutive night-time doses of the soft capsule. Absorption from the soft gelatin capsule was faster and produced earlier and higher peak plasma levels. There were no differences in relative availability. 3 The apparent half-life of temazepam after night-time administration was shorter than after morning administration, but no change was observed between the first and seventh night-time doses.", 
    "25": "1 Absorption, excretion and detoxification of temazepam were investigated in man, mouse, rat and dog. Considerable interspecies variation was apparent with respect to excretion and metabolite patterns in blood and urine. Animal species were exposed to equal or greater concentrations of all the metabolites occurring in man. 2 Pharmacokinetics of temazepam in man were investigated in a single dose study at two dose levels, and in a multiple dose study. The results of both studies were analyzed and interpreted with the help of compartmental models. Values were obtained for excretion pattern (0-infinity), half lives (1.95, 0.5, 10.0 and 1.9 h), amounts in all compartments, and for steady-state conditions. 3 The bioavailability of the hard gelatin capsule dosage form was compared with that of a suspension serving as the ideal dosage form, and found to be acceptable.", 
    "26": "1 It is commonplace for drugs to vary by only minor chemical differences. This is particularly so for those seven benzodiazepines discussed in this paper which are related both as precursors and as metabolites. However, minor chemical differences may cause major differences in physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties. 2 Although the physicochemical differences are difficult to relate to effect, the influence of structure on absorption, distribution and elimination is of considerable importance in governing duration of effect, as shown by studies in monkeys and in man. This in turn dictates the suitability of a particular drug as a day or night sedative, as an anticonvulsant, or as an anxiolytic. 3 Structure affects the relative potency of the compounds as anticonvulsants, anxiolytics or sedatives so that judicious choice of a particular compound for a particular patient and condition will lead to improved therapy. It is fallacious to consider all benzodiazepines as similar.", 
    "27": "Efficacy and safety of the 1,5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, in comparison to the 1,4 benzodiazepine, diazepam, were controlled in sixty psychiatric out-patients over a period of three months. In the course of this long treatment period data were obtained confirming findings of shorter-lasting studies. Global assessment of the therapeutic efficacy and the total scores of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale revealed no significant the compounds. Both groups showed a significant (p less than 0.01) improvement in the total scores of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale after two weeks of treatment. Scores of the individual items indicated distinct spectra of action: Clobazam was more effective in diminishing anxious mood, whereas diazepam was better able to influence muscular symptoms of anxiety. The relevance of the findings for a more individualized therapy is pointed out.", 
    "28": "An interim report at six months of a post-marketing surveillance study of Euhypnos Forte, a new high-dose temazepam preparation for the treatment of insomniac patients resistant to conventional hypnotic dosage. The analysis includes 2,043 First Reports (FRs) of two weeks treatment and 669 Second Reports (SRs) of three months treatment. More than 95% of the patients took a nightly dose of two capsules, temazepam 40 mg. Adverse reactions were generally acceptable, consisting mainly of headache, vivid dreams, gastro-intestinal disturbances and hangover effects. The preparation was effective in 88.6% of patients at two weeks and 95.8% at three months. All patients had previously found other hypnotics ineffective. Euhypnos Forte was rated effective by 85.5% of the 874 patients who had previously found nitrazepam unsatisfactory, and by 90.0% of the 201 who found barbiturates unsatisfactory.", 
    "29": "Seventy insomniac patients, previously unresponsive to conventional hypnotic dosage, were treated for seven nights with temazepam in 20 mg soft gelatin capsules (Euhypnos Forte). The patients adjusted the dose to suit themselves up to a maximum of 60 mg. Nineteen patients found that one 20 mg capsule suited them best in spite of previous lack of response to two 10 mg capsules, and were thus excluded from the final analysis. Out of the remaining fifty-one patients, thirty-five were best suited by 40 mg and sixteen by 60 mg of temazepam. Sleep was rated Very Good or Good by forty patients (78.4%) and significant hangover occurred in only four (7.8%), all of whom were on 40 mg. Adverse reactions were insignificant. Some observations by one author (CALM) on the significance of the results in the management of insomnia in general practice are included.", 
    "30": "In an open evaluation, soft gelatin capsules containing 20 mg temazepam (Euhypnos Forte) were administrated in doses of 40--60 mg to 134 patients from twenty-two general practices. The patients selected by the general practitioners werethose known to require hypnotics but in whom conventional doses had proven unsatisfactory. Of the 134 patients who entered the trial, 104 preferred the higher doses of two or three capsules. Eighty-eight per cent of these patients found Euhypnos Forte to be 'very good' or 'good' and 69% expressed preference for Euhypnos over their customary medication. Eighty-eight per cent of these patients experinces no hangover effect.",

These new possibilities are suitable to the rapid determination of psychotropic drugs in biological fluids of patients in emergency clinical toxicology. We are comparing circular and linear techniques with regard to the choice of solvent systems, diffusion time, isolation and characterization of implicated drugs.", 
    "32": "The study compared prazepam with diazepam, chlorazepate dipotassium, and placebo in the treatment of anxious out-patients. Patients were screened for participation in the study to be sure they met the criteria for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had complicating physical or mental problems. All patients signed an informed consent. Seventy-three patients entered the study, thirteen did not complete at least two weeks of treatment and were not used in the data analysis. Of these thirteen, ten did not return and were lost to follow-up, tow entered the hospital for reasons unrelated to the drug study, and one patient on diazepam was terminated because of increased anxiety. Six patients were used in the data analysis, thirty-six males and twenty-four females with an age range of 21-61 years. Side-effects were minimal. Drowsiness was reported by two people in the placebo group, one taking chlorazepate dipotassium, three on prazepam and one on diazepam. One diazepam patient reported nausea and vomitting. Scores on the Zung Self-Rating Scale for Anxiety showed all three drug groups to be superior to placebo. The Hopkins Symptom Check-list found prazepam and diazepam to be superior to placebo and chlorazepate. No differences among the groups were found in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Prazepam may offer advantages over the other available benzodiazepines since it may be more readily absorbed than chlorazepate and has less side-effects than diazepam.", 
    "33": "Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured in ten patients before and after the administration of 0.28 mg.kg-1 of diazepam, using a spirometer placed in the circuit of an MA1 respirator functioning on a closed circuit basis. The results showed a significant decrease in VO2 OF 8 p. 100. The differences seen in comparison with previous studies may be explained by differences in the methods of study used. It would appear that this hypometabolic effect is not an intrinsic property of diazepam but rather a consequence of the neurodepressive properties of the drug, on the gamma system in particular.", 
    "34": "The fate of a novel imidazo-benzodiazepine (I) was studied in male rats and rabbits using 14C and 3H-labelled I. In both species the compound was rapidly and widely absorbed after an oral dose of 5 mg/kg to give peak tissue and plasma levels after 1 hour in the rat and 4 hours in the rabbit. The highest concentrations of radioactivity were present in the liver (rat) and liver, kidney and subcutaneous fat (rabbit). Plasma levels of radioactivity fell to 3% of the maximum value in 24 hours in the rat but 48 hours were required for a similar fall in the rabbit. The main route of elimination of radioactivity was via the bile followed by excretion in the faeces. For the rat the rate of biliary elimination was 16.6% of the administered dose/hour; for the rabbit this rate was 5.6%/hour. Recovery of administered radioactivity during 0-24 hours for urine and faeces respectively was 4.8% and 69% for the rat and 23.2% and 10.9% for the rabbit. Up to 97% of the radioactivity administered to rats could be recovered in the excreta in the 7 days following dosing. Up to 90% of the dose administered to rabbits appeared in the excreta during 10 days. No unchanged (I) could be detected in the urine or bile. The radioactive metabolites were polar products, some of which were in the form of glucuronide conjugates.", 
    "35": "In an attempt to explain the marked inter-trial differences in the percentage of patients reported to benefit from the anxiolytic agent lorazepam, a statistical analysis was carried out on the scores from a psychiatric symptom questionnaire, completed before and after treatment with lorazepam, by 69 psychiatric out-patients. Most of the patients presented with a mixture of different syndromes, with moderate to severe symptoms, and had already failed to respond to other treatment. Forty of the patients showed a favourable response to lorazepam. Multivariate analysis of the strength of 6 symptom clusters versus therapeutic response in this diagnostically heterogeneous patient sample revealed that, in addition to anxiety, there was a high relationship also between phobic and psychosomatic symptom scores and response to lorazepam. The relationship between depression scores and response was only of borderline significance, and that for hysteria and obsessionality was poor. It is suggested that one explanation of inter-trial differences in the percentages of patients improved by lorazepam may be that they are due to differences in the diagnostic composition of the patient populations studied.", 
    "36": "The feed intake stimulants elfazepam (E), a benzodiazepine, and 9-aza-cannabinol (9-AC) decrease rumen contractions and abomasal acid content in sheep and E increases rumen fluid volume, digestibility and overall nutrient availability. E has been hypothesized to decrease the propulsive activity of the entire GI tract. To further examine the effects of E and 9-AC on gastric function, 4 ewes were prepared with abomasal cannulas and 3 silver/silver chloride monopolar electrodes alternated with 2 strain gauges on the distal one-third of the abomasal serosa. Electromyographical (slow waves and action potentials) and contractile (rates and forces) activities and abomasal pH were measured. Treatment of 8 and 16 mg E had no effect on slow wave frequency, action potential rate, contraction rate, or contraction force. Abomasal content pH was decreased with 8 mg E. Treatments of 125 and 250 microgram 9-AC depressed action potential and contraction rates and contraction force but had no effect on slow wave frequency or pH.", 
    "37": "Oxazepam glucuronide isolated from swine urine by previously published methods was separated into its diastereoisomers by ion-exchange chromatography on a preparative scale. Quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography was used to monitor the separation. The two isomers were obtained in analytically pure form and then characterized by elemental analysis, oxazepam content, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy, optical rotation and optical rotatory dispersion-circular dichroism. The latter permitted the assignment of the dextrorotatory and the levorotatory isomers to the (S)- and (R)- configurations, respectively. Rates of enzymic hydrolysis depend on the configuration of the substrate as well as on the enzyme preparation used. Rate of cleavage was highest with the (S)-(+)-glucuronide and beta-glucuronidase from Escherichia coli. This enzyme possesses the highest degree of stereoselectivity; it hydrolyzes the (S)-(+)-isomer more than 400 times faster than the (R)-(-)-form. Bovine liver glucuronidase is less stereoselective, whereas glucuronidase preparations of molluscan origin exhibit little stereoselectivity. The ready hydrolysis of one of the glucuronides by an enzyme from an intestinal microorganism may play a role in the enterohepatic circulation of oxazepam.", 
    "38": "In a large series of patients who have abused a variety of commercially available \"amphetamine-like\" agents as well as \"street drugs\" with CNS stimulant activity, the specific lytic effects of propranolol (Inderal) were utilized to reverse the dangerous hyperkinetic cardiovascular and frightening CNS phenomena noted in these non-comatose individuals. Presented here is a logical and clinically proven mode of therapy by which the authors have consistently, successfully, and safely managed such patients in \"adrenergic crisis\" by judicious titration of electrolytes, propranolol, and diazepam.", 
    "39": "1 The methodology used in studies to assess the effects of drugs on car-driving performance is reviewed. 2 Clobazam 20 mg, diazepam 10 mg or placebo were administered daily for 3 d to 24-male students with a high neuroticism score (on the Cattell Personality Factors Questionnaire). 3 Car driving performance was assessed on the second day in real traffic conditions; tests of attention and concentration and subjective assessments were made on the third day. 4 Diazepam 10 mg significantly impaired braking reaction time in comparison with clobazam 20 mg and placebo (P less than 0.01). Subjects also reported feeling more 'depressed' and lethargic after diazepam.", 
    "40": "1 The immediate and residual effects on performance of benzodiazepines differ, and the differences are important in the use of these drugs. 2. Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, each possess hypnotic activity, and have effects on performance limited to the sleep period. The demethylated metabolite of diazepam, nordiazepam, and its precursor, potassium clorazepate, which also possess hypnotic activity, have a longer duration of action, although the next day anxiolytic effect is accompanied by only minimal effects on performance. The 1.5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, seems to have minimal immediate effects on performance. 3 Diazepam and its hydroxylated metabolites, temazepam and oxazepam, would be useful in the management of insomnia without psychopathology in those cases in which residual effects on performance must be avoided. Nordiazepam and potassium clorazepate would be appropriate for insomnia secondary to day-time anxiety, and clobazam may be useful as a day-time anxiolytic. 4 It is emphasized that more work needs to be carried out on the effects of anxiolytics on performance before one can be certain that ingestion during the day would be without any deleterious effects on skilled work.", 
    "41": "1 Three studies are described, the first being a comparison of the effects of acute night-time doses of clobazam 20 mg, amylobarbitone sodium 100 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg and placebo, on choice reaction time, critical flicker fusion (CFF) and stabilometer performance. Clobazam improved early morning performance on a choice reaction test, in contrast to the other two active drugs. 2 Repeated doses of clobazam 10 mg three times daily, chlordiazepoxide 10 mg three times daily and diazepam 5 mg three times daily were given for 5 days. Again clobazam did not produce any impairment of psychomotor performance, and noticeably increased CFF thresholds. 3 The effects of an acute night-time dose of clobazam 20 mg on psychomotor performance the morning after night-time medication were correlated with the neuroticism scores (on the EPI) of the subjects. Clobazam exerts a differential effect on psychomotor performance dependent on the basic personality trait. 4 Clobazam seems to differ significantly from the 1,4-benzodiazepines in that, although it reduces anxiety, it does so without any apparent impairment of psychomotor performance.", 
    "42": "1 In several studies clobazam exhibited a potency which ranges between that of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. Its anxiolytic and anti-aggression effects are produced by doses usually ranging below those that cause disorders in motor activity. 2 This separation was demonstrable to an even greater degree with the desmethyl metabolite. The activity of the metabolite, however, was weaker than that of the original substance. 3 The advantage of clobazam compared with the 1.4 benzodiazepines lies mainly in the fact that motor activity is influenced only after very high doses, these doses being markedly above those required to induce tranquillizing and anti-agression activities. 4 Clobazam has no marked effect on the cardiovascular system, respiration of excretion.", 
    "43": "1 The detracting psychomotor effects of diazepam (5 mg three times daily) and clobazam (an investigational 1,5-benzodiazepine) were compared with placebo effects over the course of the initial day of medication. Tests were administered at hourly intervals and the data were analyzed from the standpoint of contrasts at each session and from the standpoint of trends that accrued during the course of the day. 2 It is concluded that among normal volunteers diazepam 5 mg three times daily may be near the threshold for detracting psychomotor consequences during the initial day and that clobazam seems to be without detracting consequences and may have some enhancing effects.", 
    "44": "1 The literature relating to the effects of benzodiazepines on psychomotor performance is critically reviewed. 2 The multiple and diverse psychomotor tests used are assessed according to their ability to demonstrate differences between drugs. 3 Three general conclusions are: (1) The speed with which simple acts of a repetitive nature are performed may be impaired by benzodiazepines. (2) learning and immediate memory will also be impaired. (3) there is relatively little indication that well established higher mental faculties are adversely involved.", 
    "45": "1. The pharmacokinetics of clobazam and its biotransformation product N-desmethylclobazam were investigated after single and multiple doses in normal subjects. 2. The relevant physicochemical properties of clobazam were measured and are presented. Different assay methods (radiochemical, fluorimetric and gas chromatographic) were applied and the results correlated. 3. After single doses the pharmacokinetic profile of clobazam includes time to peak levels 1--4 h after dosing, peak levels increasing linearly with the logarithm of dose, and terminal half-lives of about 18 hours. At least 87% of an oral dose is absorbed, as indicated by urinary recovery of labelled material. 4. In multiple-dose studies unchanged clobazam levelled off at minimum steady-state concentrations within one week of dosing. During 28 d of medication N-desmethylclobazam accumulated to near steady-state levels about eight times higher than those of the unchanged compound. 5. No pharmacokinetic interactions were discovered between clobazam and the antidepressant nomifensine.", 
    "46": "1 Clobazam has been assayed in human serum using a radioreceptor technique. 2 The assay is simple and sufficiently sensitive for detecting serum levels up to 48 h after oral administration of a usual clinical dose. It has the advantage of measuring the parent compound plus active metabolites. 3 Serum clearances and elimination half-lives have been determined for five subjects.", 
    "47": "1 Extensive toxicological investigations of clobazam are summarized. 2 LD50 values after oral administration ranged from 100 mg/kg in the dog to 6000 mg/kg in the rat. 3 Long-term repeated dose studies have shown withdrawal effects in the dog and monkey (notably convulsions leading to death), similar to those known to occur with other benzodiazepines. 4 It is concluded that the overall safety and tolerability of clobazam have been demonstrated in the preclinical animal studies.", 
    "48": "1 Recent studies have demonstrated growing evidence for a primary action of the benzodiazepines on gabaminergic neurones which induces a facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission. As enhancement of GABA release has been suggested to account for their activation of GABA mechanisms, the effect of diazepam and clobazam, and of several other psychotropic drugs, on stimulated GABA release have been studied. 2 Using rat brain cortex slices saturated with [3H]-GABA, the electrically stimulated overflow of GABA is reduced in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of both diazepam and clobazam. 3 The benzodiazepine-induced reduction in GABA overflow during electrical stimulation is antagonized by the GABA receptor blocker bicuculline, whereas bicuculline alone at 10(-6) M concentration does not change the overflow. 4 Among some other centrally active drugs tested, hexobarbitone and the 'second messenger; cyclic GMP also induce a significant but less marked reduction in GABA release. 5 A schematic model of a central gabaminergic synapse is proposed, which may explain the benzodiazepine effects on stimulated GABA release by suggesting an inhibitory feedback control of transmitter release mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors ('autoreceptors').", 
    "49": "1 The structures and chemistry of the 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines are compared. These two groups of drugs differ in respect to basicity, lipophilicity and electronic charge distribution. 2 The 1,4-benzodiazepine diazepam has a weakly basic imine group in contrast to the acid methylene protons of clobazam. 3 The imine function of diazepam is more lipophilic than the carboxamide group of clobazam with its rather hydrophilic character. 4 Diazepam and clobazam differ in electronic charge distribution and hence in the location of the chemically reactive centres, the imine partial structure in diazepam and the malonic acid portion of clobazam.", 
    "50": "1 Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine the pharmacological profile of which differs from that of the 1,4 benzodiazepines in that it displays a wide separation of psychosedative or 'tranquillizing' properties from impairment of motor coordination. This is associated with a relative lack of muscle relaxant activity. 2 In man it seems to be an effective anxiolytic agent when given in daily doses of 20-30 mg but produces minimal effects on psychomotor performance at these dose levels. 3 Clobazam has a long elimination half-life of about 18 h; the main metabolite is N-desmethylclobazam. Clobazam seems to share the good safety and tolerability characteristics of the 1,4 benzodiazepines.", 
    "51": "1 Clobazam was compared with placebo and diazepam in 45 double-blind studies. 2 Clobazam dosage ranged from 5 mg daily (paediatric patients) to 120 mg daily (psychiatric in-patients). Usual daily dosage in out-patient therapy ranged from 20-30 mg clobazam. 3 Treatment duration varied from a few days up to 3.5 years. The usual duration of treatment was 2-4 weeks. 4 Clobazam was shown to be an efficacious and well tolerated anxiolytic agent in various neurotic and psychosomatic disorders. 5 Dosages showing distinct anxiolytic effects in out-patient therapy did not impair psychomotor performance.", 
    "52": "1 In an uncontrolled clinical trial, carried out in 11 psychiatric patients with the clinical diagnoses of anxiety neurosis and depressive neurosis, clobazam, a new benzodiazepine preparation, in the dosage range 10-60 mg daily produced statistically significant improvement in the total and both factor scores of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). The lowest mean total HAM-A scores occurred with a mean clobazam dosage of 48 mg daily. 2 Results of the uncontrolled clinical trial were further substantiated in a standard-controlled clinical study in which no statistically significant difference between the therapeutic effectiveness of clobazam and diazepam could be revealed. The lowest mean total HAM-A scores occurred with a mean clobazam dosage of 49 mg daily. There was a lower incidence of adverse effects reported in patients receiving clobazam than in those taking the control drug (diazepam).", 
    "53": "1 Forty-four clinically anxious patients entered a comparative double-blind trial of clobazam 20 mg, clobazam 30 mg and dipotassium clorazepate 15 mg, all drugs given as a single dose at night. 2 Assessment by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Morbid Anxiety Inventory (Salkind) and a Visual Analogue Scale showed a statistically significant improvement for all treatment groups after 2 weeks, with continued improvement after a further 2 weeks. 3 Daytime drowsiness was the commonest side-effect in all treatment groups but there was a tendency for a lower incidence in patients on clobazam. There was no evidence of a dose-related incidence of drowsiness in the clobazam 20 mg and 30 mg groups. Other side-effects were few and nonspecific. 4 Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine with an elimination half-life of 18 hours. When given in single doses of 20-30 mg at night it has an equivalent effect to dipotassium clorazepate 15 mg."
