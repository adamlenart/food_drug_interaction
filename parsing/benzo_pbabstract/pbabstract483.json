    "0": "Thirty-seven patients with a wide range of illnesses were studied during mechanical ventilation of the lungs in an intensive care unit. Fifteen were sedated with a continuous propofol infusion, with analgesia provided by bolus doses of papaveretum. Twelve received a continuous infusion of papaveretum, supplemented by bolus doses of midazolam. The level of sedation was assessed every four hours and measurements were made of haemodynamic and respiratory variables. Levels of sedation were generally satisfactory in both groups. Six patients who received propofol required the use of muscle relaxants, because of their strong respiratory drives, to achieve synchronisation with the ventilator. There was no significant difference in respiratory or haemodynamic variables between the groups, but several patients required inotropic support because of their disease. There was no evidence of inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis in the propofol group. Propofol can be a useful sedative agent in the intensive care unit, but sedative regimens should be tailored to individual patient requirements.", 
    "1": "Two hundred and ten psychiatric patients with one of three DSM-III diagnoses, generalized anxiety disorder (N = 71), panic disorder (N = 74) or dysthymic disorder (N = 65), were included in a clinical trial in which diazepam, dothiepin or placebo tablets, cognitive and behaviour therapy, or a self-help package were given over ten weeks. Personality status was assessed independently using a structured interview, the Personality Assessment Schedule. One hundred and ninety-eight patients had personality assessments, 89% with a close informant. Thirty-six per cent had a personality disorder and these patients had more severe psychopathology than those with no personality disorder. Personality disorder was more common in patients with dysthymic disorder and this group responded less well to treatment. The category of personality disorder had no apparent influence on symptoms.", 
    "2": "A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, MK-329, was used to explore the physiological role of CCK in regulating pancreatic endocrine function in humans. The ability of CCK to increase plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) concentrations and blockade of this effect with MK-329 were evaluated in a double blind, balanced, four-period cross-over study. Eight subjects received single oral doses of 0.5, 2, or 10 mg MK-329 or placebo, followed by an iv infusion of CCK-8 (34 ng/kg.h). In placebo-treated subjects, PP increased from basal levels of 70 +/- 15 (+/- SE) to peak values of 291 +/- 58 pg/mL after CCK infusion (P less than 0.05 compared to basal). This increase in plasma PP concentration was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by MK-329, with 10 mg antagonizing the stimulatory effect of CCK infusion by nearly 80%. Second, the effect of MK-329 on meal-stimulated pancreatic endocrine responses was evaluated by giving placebo or 10 mg MK-329 2 h before ingestion of a mixed meal. Eight subjects were treated in a randomized two-period cross-over fashion. With placebo treatment, peak postprandial plasma insulin, glucagon, and glucose concentrations were 101 +/- 8 microU/mL, 195 +/- 15 pg/mL, and 150 +/- 10 mg/dL, respectively (all P less than 0.05). The integrated PP response following the meal was 56.3 +/- 11.1 ng/mL.minute. With MK-329 treatment, the integrated PP concentration was reduced to 33.9 +/- 2.2 ng/mL.min (P less than 0.05 compared to placebo treatment). Mean postprandial insulin, glucagon, and glucose concentrations did not differ between placebo and MK-329 treatments. We conclude that CCK receptor blockade with 10 mg MK-329 does not alter plasma insulin, glucagon, or glucose responses to a mixed meal. However, the observation that physiological concentrations of CCK increase plasma levels of PP, and the finding that CCK receptor blockade selectively attenuates the postprandial increase in plasma PP concentrations support a physiological role for CCK in regulating PP secretion.", 
    "3": "Twenty-three patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for social phobia were randomly assigned either to a clonazepam treatment group or to a nontreatment control group in an 8-week pilot study. Clonazepam was found to have a significant effect on the treated patients, as demonstrated by scores on a variety of instruments measuring overall anxiety and phobic avoidance, and social phobic symptoms. Initial sedation, which was experienced by 70% of the treated subjects, was the most common side effect of clonazepam treatment and usually resolved spontaneously or with dose reduction. The preliminary findings of this pilot study are sufficiently promising to warrant further study of the efficacy of clonazepam in this condition.", 
    "4": "Although reliable biological markers of dysfunctional childhood anxiety disorders are lacking, such disorders can be recognized by their symptoms. In separation anxiety and avoidance disorders, anxiety is limited to certain settings; in overanxious disorder, anxiety is generalized. Treatment for childhood anxiety disorders has included behavioral and pharmacologic intervention alone or in combination, but evidence of the efficacy of medical treatment is sparse. Some antidepressants and benzodiazepines have undergone limited studies. Clonazepam has been chosen for further study because in adults it reduced panic attacks and produced few serious side effects. In extensive studies of clonazepam for childhood seizure disorders, side effects were reported, but later reports indicate that many side effects were due to rapid induction and large doses. Transient drowsiness, lethargy, irritability, or excitability have been reported in various epilepsy studies. Clonazepam's minimal potential for drug interactions is another feature recommending it for extended trials in childhood anxiety disorders, and such a double-blind crossover study is underway.", 
    "5": "Data from 12 patients (in two control study groups) provide preliminary results of an ongoing double-blind comparison of clonazepam and imipramine in the treatment of panic disorder. In both treatment groups, the patients' global improvement was substantial over the first few weeks and persisted over the 6-month treatment period based on assessments by the therapist and the patient; side effects were mild. Faintness was slightly more prevalent among patients on clonazepam treatment but disappeared after the first few weeks. Mild, persistent tachycardia was reported among patients receiving imipramine. No tolerance emerged, and discontinuation was successful in 2 patients from each group after 6 months of treatment. Eight patients needed continued medication (25-50 mg/day of imipramine, 0.5-2.0 mg/day of clonazepam) to maintain substantial improvement. Findings confirm earlier reports from open studies that low doses of both drugs eliminate panic attacks (about 50 mg/day for imipramine and 1.5 mg/day for clonazepam).", 
    "6": "A thorough understanding of the pharmacologic properties of lipid-soluble drugs is essential when using these agents to treat status epilepticus. In addition to physiologic factors, such as blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, pharmacokinetic principles, including half-life, distribution, elimination, and volume of distribution (with special regard to an agent's lipid-solubility rating), should be applied. These factors, in toto, will influence the choice of drug, its loading dose, and its therapeutic dose.", 
    "7": "The importance of age-related changes in drug sensitivity is increasingly appreciated. More conclusive evidence is now being presented in combined kinetic and dynamic studies. The type, intensity, and duration of drug action may be affected, ranging from therapeutic failure to major drug toxicity. Alterations in physiologic and homeostatic systems, including the autonomic system, baroreceptors, thermoregulation, and balance, have been described. These may explain the propensity to postural hypotension, falls, hypothermia, and confusion, particularly following drug-induced decrements in these systems. Studies on the sensitivity to individual drugs produce a varied picture emphasizing the danger of generalizations. An increased sensitivity to many agents affecting the central nervous system, including benzodiazepines, halothane, metoclopramide, and narcotic analgesics, is becoming apparent. For the latter this may also be accompanied by an age-associated qualitative difference in toxicity. Whereas there is conclusive evidence of a reduced responsiveness to propranolol, the data are conflicting for calcium antagonists. The increased hypotensive response to ACE inhibitors is more likely due to kinetic factors. The anticoagulant response to warfarin is enhanced. Evidence is also emerging of a wide divergence in the sensitivity of different systems to the same drug--with aging the inotropic effect of theophylline is increased, but the bronchodilator response is decreased. It is becoming clear also that there is a need to separately study certain subgroups of the elderly population.", 
    "8": "Using rats which are self-administering ethanol in an operant situation, we have tested a variety of agonists and antagonists in an attempt to determine the role various CNS neurotransmitters may play in ethanol drinking. The major emphasis of the work has been on the dopaminergic and the benzodiazepinergic systems. This paper reviews prior work and provides new data on additional agonists and antagonists. The data suggest a possible reciprocal interaction between dopamine and benzodiazepine brain systems. This hypothesis is based on the change in pattern of lever responding which results when various agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists related to these neurotransmitters are compared. That is, similar changes in response pattern are found for dopamine agonists and benzodiazepine inverse agonists. On the other hand, dopamine antagonists and benzodiazepine agonists are similar to each other and produce a different set of changes. A neural circuit for a reciprocal interaction between the ventral tegmentum and the nucleus accumbens is proposed as one possible pathway which may be involved in these observations.", 
    "9": "It has been reported that proglumide and L-364,718 potentiate opioid-induced antinociception. However, their mode of action in pain modulation is still not understood. To evaluate a possible interaction with opioid receptors, we determined the affinities of the CCK antagonists proglumide, lorglumide, benzotript and L-364,718 on mu, delta and kappa binding sites, using guinea pig brain crude synaptosome preparations. These affinities were compared to that of the central CCK binding site, using rat brain slide-mounted sections. At 100 microM, proglumide competed for 13% and 17% of mu and kappa binding sites, but did not interact with delta and CCK sites. At this concentration, lorglumide reduced mu, delta, kappa and CCK specific binding by 44%, 69%, 35% and 88%, whereas benzotript diminished it by 16%, 13%, 38% and 48%, respectively. L-364,718 did not interact with opioid receptors (assay limit of solubility, 10 microM) but had a high affinity for CCK binding sites (IC50, 126nM). The lack of selectivity of proglumide, lorglumide and benzotript for CCK receptors suggests that their reported ability to potentiate morphine analgesia may be related to an interaction with opioid receptors.",

The compounds (IV), VI a) and (VI c) were active on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; in particular (VI a) and (VI c) were very active. The compound (VI g) showed an affinity, even though scanty, for the central benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "11": "A comparative analysis was carried out in experiments on mice, using the methodology of the conditioned passive avoidance reaction, of the effectiveness of the blockade of the BD-GABA ionophore complex and its individual components in the recovery of a memory trace following \"psychogenic\" amnesia developing against the background of preliminary activation of BD-receptors by diazepam. It was shown that an improvement in the reproduction of the conditioned reaction was observed on the second day under conditions of \"neurochemical tuning\" only with the blockade of the GABAA receptor by bicuculline. Flumazepil and picrotoxin did not elicit an improvement in the reproduction of the reaction. A similar relationship of the effectiveness of the pharmacological actions was observed on the 21st day after training and \"psychogenic\" amnesia. The facts presented permit the hypothesis that the development of \"psychogenic\" amnesia is determined by the functional state, which governs the possibility of retrieving the memory trace, of the mediator systems of the brain during learning and the amnestic influence.", 
    "12": "Exposure to ethanol during pregnancy results in the alternation of 3H-diazepam binding to synaptosomal neocortical membranes from the rat offspring. In male experimental rats, 14 days of age, binding level diminished to 11%. In two-month-old control rats Scatchard plot was biphasic. It has been shown that prenatal exposure to ethanol leads to changes in the nature of binding in two-month-age experimental animals, as compared with the control ones. 3H-diazepam binding changes went along with behavioural deviations. In experimental rats locomotor activity was increased in the \"open field\" test, passive avoidance conditioned reflex retention was decreased and elaboration parameters of active avoidance conditioned reflex were changed, as compared with the control ones. The data obtained show that higher integrative functions were disturbed by prenatal alcoholization. Correlations between benzodiazepine receptor state and behaviour were studied.", 
    "13": "Akabane disease in cattle is characterized by congenital abnormalities including arthrogryposis, which is characterized by a depletion of spinal ventral horn motoneurons, a loss of axons, and depletion of myelin in the lateral and ventral tracts. These neuropathological changes produced major reductions (70-80%) in the density of muscarinic cholinergic, glycine/strychnine, and central-type benzodiazepine receptors in the ventral horn motor nuclei. The density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors and adenosine A1 receptors was dramatically increased (250-300%) in the lateral and ventral spinal columns, reflecting the proliferation of glial cells. Bovine Akabane disease represents a useful model for assessing the processes and consequences of neuronal degeneration and demyelination and has implications for human diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", 
    "14": "Intravenous anesthetics can be readily administered to rabbits through the marginal ear vein. In this study, three intravenous anesthetic protocols were evaluated in New Zealand White rabbits. The three anesthetic regimens were: (a) pentobarbital (40 mg/kg); (b) ketamine-xylazine (25-5 mg/kg); (c) midazolam-xylazine-alfentanil (1-1-0.1 mg/kg). The anesthetics were injected slowly over defined time intervals. Reactions to noxious stimuli were determined before and after administration of the anesthetics. Additionally, the effects of the anesthetic agents on the rabbit's cardiopulmonary system were evaluated. Rabbits anesthetized with midazolam-xylazine-alfentanil did not have a pedal withdrawal or ear pinch reflex throughout the testing period. The ketamine-xylazine combination produced a shorter duration of non-responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbital had the greatest variability in response to noxious stimuli. Apnea occurred in at least one rabbit in each group. A side effect unique to the midazolam-xylazine-alfentanil group was the occurrence of opisthotonus or seizure activity during or shortly after the administration of alfentanil. Hypotension, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis were characteristic of the cardiopulmonary effects of the anesthetics. When choosing an anesthetic regimen for rabbits, intravenous infusion should be considered as an option. Advantages include ease of administration, possibility of redosing as required, and minimal requirements for equipment. Disadvantages of intravenous anesthetic infusion in rabbits include potential for lethal overdose and metabolic alterations after administration.", 
    "15": "The behavioral manifestations of acute ethanol intoxication resemble those of benzodiazepines, barbiturates and general anesthetics. This has led to speculation that these drugs share common mechanisms or sites of actions within the brain. The discovery of a specific benzodiazepine receptor site, and the subsequent development of selective receptor antagonist and inverse agonist drugs, provides a framework to test the involvement of the benzodiazepine receptor complex in mediating ethanol's behavioral effects. The partial inverse agonist Ro15-4513, an analog of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15-1788 (flumazenil), has been reported to block or reduce some of ethanol's acute effects in rodents by a benzodiazepine receptor-mediated action. There has been some controversy over whether the \"antialcohol\" effect of Ro15-4513 is a unique property of this compound or is shared by other benzodiazepine antagonists with inverse agonist activity. We have studied the effects of Ro15-4513 and other benzodiazepine receptor antagonists on acute ethanol intoxication in mice and have obtained evidence that 1) Ro15-4513 differentially affects acute effects of ethanol, 2) an \"antialcohol\" property is not a general feature of all benzodiazepine antagonists and inverse agonists, and 3) \"antialcohol\" activity may not be unique to Ro15-4513.", 
    "16": "The effect of cold-immobilized stress on the gamma-aminobutylic acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine (BZP) receptor complex in the rat striatum was examined. The stressful manipulation induced a significant decrease in the amount of [3H]muscimol binding sites in the striatal particulate fraction. On the other hand, [3H]flunitrazepam (FLN) binding and the enhancing effect of FLN or secobarbital on the [3H]muscimol binding to the striatal particulate fraction were not influenced by the stress treatment. These results suggest that cold-immobilized stress may selectively change GABAA receptor binding without altering BZP receptor binding as well as the functional coupling between GABAA and BZP receptors.", 
    "17": "Diazepam (2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg, but not 1.0 mg/kg) administered in eight acquisition sessions significantly impaired the light-cued successive discrimination of male Sprague-Dawley rats. In two postdrug (vehicle) sessions, groups previously treated with the drug demonstrated good recovery in discrimination. An analysis of response components indicated that the impairment was due to the failure of drugged subjects to inhibit or withhold responses during the no go periods of the task. These findings are consistent with a \"disinhibitory hypothesis\" of drug impairment. The similarity of the present findings to those previously reported with chlordiazepoxide suggests that such effects are a generalized characteristic of the benzodiazepine class of drugs.", 
    "18": "Certain drugs generally regarded as GABA agonists, such as valproate and combinations of muscimol and baclofen, have been reported to produce apparent anxiolytic effects in various animal behavioral tests. The present paper reports two experiments on the effects of these agents on conditioned suppression in rats. In the first study, muscimol (0, 1.25 micrograms/kg or 1 mg/kg), baclofen (0, 1 mg/kg) and combinations of these treatments failed to alleviate conditioned suppression. Experiment Two showed that valproate (200 mg/kg) did attenuate conditioned suppression, and that its effects were antagonised by picrotoxin (1.5 mg/kg), but not by bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg), Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) or by delta-amino-n-valeric acid (10 mg/kg). The findings are discussed in the context of the proposed GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, with the conclusion that there is little evidence for a mediating role of GABAa or GABAb receptors in such drug actions, and that the site of valproate action is probably the chloride ion channel associated with the receptor complex.", 
    "19": "The behavioral effects of a given amount of ethanol vary greatly between alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects. A blood alcohol level of more than 150 mg/dL without gross evidence of intoxication is a definitive diagnostic laboratory test for alcoholism (1). In a previous paper, I have proposed that the human body produces a substance similar to caffeine (2). In the present paper, my new concept is used to explain the intriguing ability of alcoholics to tolerate the effects of ethanol. Understanding why alcoholics differ from normal individuals in, their response to ethanol is an important step that will pave the way for the prevention of the transmission of alcoholism to future generations.", 
    "20": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors were evaluated using the specific ligand [3H]-PK 11195 in brain homogenates from nine cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma and from an equal number of age-matched control subjects. Histopathological studies showed evidence of severe Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the brains of all cirrhotic patients. Saturation-binding assays revealed a single saturable binding site for [3H]-PK 11195 in brain, with affinities in the 2- to 3-nmol/L range. Diazepam was found to be a relatively potent inhibitor of 3H-PK 11195 binding (IC50 = 253 nmol/L), whereas the central benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 displaced 3H-PK 11195 binding with low affinity (IC50 greater than 40 mumols/L). Densities of [3H]-PK 11195 binding sites were found to be increased by 48% (p less than 0.01) and 25% (p less than 0.05) in frontal cortex and caudate nuclei, respectively, from cirrhotic patients. Densities of [3H]-PK 11195 binding sites in frontal cortex from two nonencephalopathic cirrhotic patients were not significantly different from control values. No concomitant changes of affinities of these binding sites were observed. Because it has been suggested that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors may be localized on mitochondrial membranes and may therefore be involved in cerebral oxidative metabolism, the alterations observed in this study could be of pathophysiological significance in hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "21": "The endogenous steroid metabolites 3 alpha,21dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one potentiate GABA-activated Cl- currents recorded from a human cell line transfected with the beta 1, alpha 1 beta 1, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 combinations of human GABAA receptor subunits. These steroids are active at nanomolar concentrations in potentiating GABA-activated Cl- currents and directly elicit bicuculline-sensitive Cl- currents when applied at micromolar concentrations. The potentiating and direct actions of both steroids were expressed with every combination of subunits tested. However, an examination of single-channel currents recorded from outside-out patches excised from these transfected cells suggests that despite the common minimal structural requirements for expressing steroid and barbiturate actions, the mechanism of GABAA receptor modulation by these pregnane steroids may differ from that of barbiturates.", 
    "22": "A novel computer-aided receptor modeling method, REMOTEDISC [J. Med. Chem. 32:746-756 (1989)], has been used to analyze the inhibition of labeled diazepam binding by 29 benzodiazepine receptor ligands. The method uses the three-dimensional structure, conformational energy, and important atom-based physicochemical properties to model the hypothetical binding site cavity. The model not only consists of the geometry of the binding cavity but also gives the weight of the various physicochemical properties of the ligands at different parts of the binding cavity responsible for their binding to the receptor. The model fitted the binding data with a correlation coefficient of 0.980, a SD of 0.223, and an explained variance of 0.898. It suggested that a small hydrophilic group is favored at position 1 of the benzodiazepine ring, the C = O region of this ring is favored by dispersive atoms and positive charge, the 4'-substituent of the 5-phenyl group is subject to strong steric repulsion, the 7- position is favored to be a hydrophilic group, and the 8- and 9- positions and their substituents are favored to be dispersive as well as hydrophilic groups. It also suggested that the substitution of the 5-phenyl group by the more dispersive 2-thiophene may increase the binding affinity. The model was allowed to predict the binding affinity data of five compounds with extensive variation of the structure from the training set; the prediction for four compounds was excellent. Some of the problems of the method have been discussed with their possible remedies.", 
    "23": "High concentrations of the \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine (pBZD) binding site (\"receptor\") have been described in the hypothalamus, the pituitary and the adrenal glands. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of ligands of this binding site on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). To accomplish this we administered graded doses of the pBZD receptor agonist 4-chloro-diazepam (Ro5-4864) i.v. to catheterized, freely moving adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Serial blood samples for plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone determinations were drawn from the catheter before and after the injection of the drug. Ro5-4864 significantly stimulated ACTH and corticosterone secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. To examine whether this effect could be antagonized by the pBZD binding site antagonist PK 11195, we treated rats with PK 11195 at doses 10- and 50-times higher than Ro5-4864 before administration of a maximally effective dose of Ro5-4864. Neither dose of PK 11195 antagonized Ro5-4864-induced plasma ACTH or corticosterone elevations. However, this agent, given alone, stimulated ACTH and corticosterone release. Similarly, carbamazepine (CBZ), which binds to the pBZD binding site with low affinity, stimulated weakly the HPA in vivo, reaching statistical significance only at the highest dose tested. To examine the site(s) of action of these compounds on the HPA, we evaluated their effects on hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary ACTH secretion in vitro. Ro5-4864 stimulated hypothalamic CRH, but not pituitary ACTH secretion. Neither PK 11195 nor CBZ had any agonist effect on hypothalamic CRH secretion in vitro, whereas both antagonized Ro5-4864-induced CRH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "Mice were made tolerant to and dependent on ethanol by administration of a liquid diet. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-dependent uptake of 36Cl- by mouse cortical microsacs was used to study the actions of benzodiazepine (BZ) agonists and inverse agonists. Chronic exposure to ethanol attenuated the ability of a BZ agonist, flunitrazepam, to augment muscimol-stimulated uptake of 36Cl- and enhanced the actions of BZ inverse agonists, Ro15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,4]-benzodiazepine - 3-carboxylate) and DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), to inhibit GABAA receptor-operated chloride channels. Augmentation of chloride flux by pentobarbital was not reduced by chronic ethanol exposure. Attenuation of flunitrazepam efficacy was transient and returned to control levels within 6 to 24 hr after withdrawal from ethanol, but increased sensitivity to Ro15-4513 was observed as long as 8 days after withdrawal. Chronic exposure to ethanol did not alter [3H]SR 95531 ([2-(3'-carbethoxy-2'propyl)-3-amino-6-p-methoxyphenylpyridazinium bromide] binding to low-affinity GABAA receptors or muscimol stimulation of chloride flux; and did not alter [3H]Ro15-4513 or [3H]flunitrazepam binding to central BZ receptors or allosteric modulation of this binding by muscimol (i.e., muscimol-shift). These results suggest that chronic exposure to ethanol reduces coupling between BZ agonist sites and the chloride channel, and may be responsible for the development of cross-tolerance between ethanol and BZ agonists. In contrast, coupling between BZ inverse agonist sites and the chloride channel is increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Acute exposure to ethanol was found to enhance the ability of a benzodiazepine (BZ) inverse agonist, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), to reduce muscimol-activated 36Cl- uptake by membranes isolated from mouse cerebral cortex. Pretreatment in vivo with a hypnotic dose of ethanol (but not a subhypnotic dose), or exposure to a corresponding concentration in vitro, was effective. This increase in sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-operated chloride channels to the actions of DMCM was due to an increase in both the potency and efficacy of DMCM. Sensitization to DMCM was reversible and was not observed 24 hr after a single injection of ethanol. Pretreatment with ethanol (10, 50 and 100 mM) in vitro produced sensitization to DMCM in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to that produced by in vivo exposure; this increase in sensitivity did not develop if the membranes were pretreated with ethanol at 0 degrees C. Similarly, in vitro exposure to pentobarbital (200 microM) or flunitrazepam (1 microM) enhanced the actions of the inverse agonist Ro15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4]BZ-3- carboxylate). Acute ethanol exposure did not alter low-affinity gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor binding or muscimol action, or the ability of a BZ agonist, flunitrazepam, to augment muscimol-activated chloride flux. Ethanol exposure did not alter [3H]flumazenil (Ro15-1788) binding to central BZ receptors, its displacement by DMCM or allosteric modulation of DMCM binding by muscimol (muscimol-shift).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Effect of ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) on the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ion channel complex was studied. Beta-CCE noncompetitively and competitively inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptor, but not [3H]muscimol binding to GABAA receptor as well as t-[3H]butylbicycloorthobenzoate [( 3H] TBOB) binding to chloride ion channel, in particulate fraction of the mouse brain. Ro15-1788 also inhibited competitively [3H] flunitrazepam binding. On the other hand, the binding of beta-[3H]CCE was inhibited noncompetitively and competitively by clonazepam and competitively by Ro15-1788. In agreement with these results, benzodiazepines-stimulated [3H]muscimol binding was antagonized by beta-CCE and Ro15-1788. Gel column chromatography for the solubilized fraction from cerebral particulate fraction by 0.2% sodium deoxycholate (DOC-Na) in the presence of 1 M KCl indicated that beta-[3H]CCE binding site was eluted in the same fraction (molecular weight, 250,000) as the binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]muscimol and [3H]TBOB. GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into membrane vesicles prepared from the bovine cerebral cortex was stimulated and attenuated by flunitrazepam and beta-CCE, respectively. These effects of flunitrazepam and beta-CCE on the GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx were antagonized by Ro15-1788. The present results suggest that the binding site for beta-CCE, which resides on GABAA receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ion channel complex, may be different from that for benzodiazepine. Possible roles of beta-CCE binding site in the allosteric inhibitions on benzodiazepine binding site as well as on the functional coupling between chloride ion channel and GABAA receptor are also suggested.", 
    "27": "Over the last several years our knowledge of neurotransmitter receptors has increased dramatically as receptor types and subtypes have been identified through the development of selective antagonists, neuropharmacological studies, and radioactive ligand binding studies. At the same time major advances were made in the immunocytochemical localization of neurotransmitters and their related enzymes. However, only recently has immunocytochemistry been used to localize neurotransmitter receptors, and these studies have been limited. Four receptors have been localized in the CNS with immunocytochemistry: the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the beta-adrenergic receptor, the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor, and the glycine receptor. Of these the glycine receptor has been the most thoroughly characterized. Glycine receptor immunoreactivity is highly concentrated at postsynaptic sites, and the distribution of immunoreactivity appears to correlate closely with glycinergic neurons. However, immunocytochemical studies done on other receptors suggest such a distribution may not always be the case. Some receptors may not be concentrated at postsynaptic sites, and receptor distribution may not always closely fit the distribution of the respective neurotransmitter. Work is rapidly progressing on the purification of other receptors and on the production of selective antibodies which will allow immunocytochemical studies which address these and other questions.", 
    "28": "We report here a study of the effects of alprazolam on in vivo pituitary-adrenal function in jacketed nonrestrained nonhuman primates and on in vitro CRH release from rat hypothalami and ACTH release from rat dispersed anterior pituicytes. We undertook this study because alprazolam is the only benzodiazepine effective in treating both major depressive and anxiety disorders, and recent data suggest that the hypercortisolism of major depression reflects hypersecretion of CRH. Moreover, the intracerebroventricular administration of CRH can reproduce many of the components of the symptom complex of major depression, including not only hypercortisolism, but also hypothalamic hypogonadism, decreased libido, anorexia, and intense anxiety. As a comparison, we also assessed the effects of diazepam on in vitro CRH release, because in contrast to alprazolam, diazepam is effective in anxiety states but not in depression. Alprazolam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, iv) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both plasma ACTH and cortisol secretion in non-restrained adult male rhesus monkeys. Our in vitro studies showed that alprazolam significantly inhibited serotonin (5HT)-induced CRH release in a dose-dependent fashion (10(-10)-10(-5) M). Diazepam also inhibited 5HT-induced CRH release, but was 40 times less potent than alprazolam. Alprazolam was ineffective in blocking basal or CRH-induced ACTH release from rat dispersed anterior pituicytes, suggesting that its in vivo effects are through inhibition of CRH secretion. As expected, the inactive benzodiazepine ligand Ro 15-1788 inhibited the effects of alprazolam on 5HT-induced CRH release, but this occurred only at doses below 10(-7) M. Interestingly, when incubated alone in higher doses with our rat hypothalamic organ culture, Ro 15-1788, like alprazolam, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 5HT-induced CRH release (10(-7)-10(-5) M), suggesting an agonistic action of Ro 15-1788 at the benzodiazepine receptor at higher concentrations. We conclude that alprazolam is capable of suppressing the primate pituitary-adrenal axis, and that this suppression most likely reflects suppression of the CRH neuron rather than of the pituitary corticotroph cell. We speculate that the enhanced capacity of alprazolam to suppress the CRH neuron relative to other benzodiazepines may contribute to its unique efficacy among this class of drugs in the treatment of major depression. The capacity of Ro 15-1788 to reverse alprazolam-induced suppression of the CRH neuron indicates that the effects of alprazolam are mediated at least in part via its interaction with the benzodiazepine component of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA macromolecular complex.", 
    "29": "Benzodiazepines are the most potent drugs used in the management of status epilepticus (SE). A number of presynaptic, postsynaptic, and nonsynaptic actions of benzodiazepines have been described. However, only the benzodiazepines' enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition and their reduction of repetitive firing occur at concentrations of unbound drug comparable to those that block absence seizures or stop clinical SE in patients. Thus, it is likely that these actions contribute to antiepileptic and anti-SE efficacy of the benzodiazepines. A predictable sequence of progressive electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during the course of generalized convulsive SE, both in humans and in experimental models, has been recently described. The homology of the sequence of EEG patterns in patients and in experimental models supports the concept that animal models should be useful in evaluating the treatment of clinical SE, and benzodiazepines are effective in stopping SE in a number of animal models. Late SE in animals, however, as in humans, is less responsive to treatment than is early SE. Forty-seven clinical studies in which clonazepam, diazepam, or lorazepam was used in the treatment of SE have been reported. Overall, lasting control of SE was achieved in 79% of the 1,346 patients in these noncontrolled studies. However, no data yet exist to differentiate the efficacy of 1 of the benzodiazepines from that of the others. Therefore, the choice of benzodiazepine is best determined by availability and by pharmacokinetic differences. Because of a much smaller volume of distribution of unbound drug, lorazepam appears to have a significantly longer effective duration of action against SE than does diazepam, which is rapidly redistributed to lipid stores in the body after intravenous administration. For this reason, we now use lorazepam in the initial treatment of patients with generalized convulsive SE.", 
    "30": "There is autoradiographic evidence that peripheral-type benzodiazepine ligands bind with high affinity to the membranes of choroid plexus tissue. In this study, the binding of a 4'-chloro analog of diazepam (Ro 5-4864) to rabbit choroid plexus and cerebral cortex was accomplished utilizing an in vitro radioactive assay method. A kinetic analysis of this binding revealed a relatively high affinity of this ligand (KD) for peripheral binding sites in plexus tissue (KD = 16.1 nM/mg protein). There was a 4.6-fold greater density of binding sites (total receptor density (Bmax) = 2.3 pmol/mg) in choroidal membrane as compared to cortical tissue (Bmax = 0.5 pmol/mg). In 40 rabbits in which a ventricular perfusion system was used, the rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) formation was observed to decrease some 48% in the presence of 10(-4) M Ro 5-4864, although some inhibition of secretory activity was still noted at a CSF concentration of 10(-8) M. The choroid plexus tissue levels of adenosine 3',5'cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) were not affected by 10(-4) M Ro 5-4864. The results of this study support the notion that the specific benzodiazepine peripheral binding sites in choroid plexus serve to modulate CSF formation. The mechanism of action is poorly understood but does not involve the transport ATPase system or the second messenger cAMP.", 
    "31": "Pentobarbital reduces cerebral radiation toxicity; however, the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. As an anesthetic and depressant of cerebral metabolism, pentobarbital induces its effects on the central nervous system by stimulating the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to its receptor and by inhibiting postsynaptic excitatory amino acid activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of these actions as well as other aspects of the radioprotective activity of pentobarbital. Fischer 344 rats were separated into multiple groups and underwent two dose-response evaluations. In one set of experiments to examine the relationship of radioprotection to pentobarbital dose, a range of pentobarbital doses (0 to 75 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally prior to a constant-level radiation dose (70 Gy). In a second series of experiments to determine the dose-response relationship of radiation protection to radiation dose, a range of radiation doses (10 to 90 Gy) were given with a single pentobarbital dose (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Further groups of animals were used to evaluate the importance of the timing of pentobarbital administration, the function of the (+) and (-) isomers of pentobarbital, and the role of an alternative GABA agonist (diazepam). In addition, the potential protective effects of alternative methods of anesthesia (ketamine) and induction of cerebral hypometabolism (hypothermia) were examined. Enhancement of survival time from acute radiation injury due to high-dose single-fraction whole-brain irradiation was maximal with 60 mg/kg of pentobarbital, and occurred over the range of all doses examined between 30 to 90 Gy. Protection was seen only in animals that received the pentobarbital before irradiation. Administration of other compounds that enhance GABA binding (Saffan and diazepam) also significantly enhanced survival time. Ketamine and hypothermia were without protective effect. Protection from acute radiation-induced mortality by pentobarbital in the rat model is a reproducible phenomenon and is associated with the GABA agonistic activity of the compound. This property of GABA agonists offers the potential for a novel approach to enhancement of the efficacy of radiation therapy in the treatment of brain tumors.", 
    "32": "A cDNA encoding a protein with 70% amino acid identity to the previously characterized gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor alpha-subunits was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library by homology screening. As observed for alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and alpha 3-subunits, coexpression of this new alpha-subunit (alpha 5) with a beta- and gamma 2-subunit in cultured cells produces receptors displaying high-affinity binding sites for both muscimol, a GABA agonist, and benzodiazepines. Characteristic of GABAA/benzodiazepine type II sites, receptors containing alpha 2-, alpha 3- or alpha 5-subunits have low affinities for several type I-selective compounds. However, alpha 5-subunit-containing receptors have lower affinities for zolpidem (30-fold) and Cl 218 872 (three-fold) than measured previously using recombinantly expressed type II receptors containing either alpha 2- or alpha 3-subunits. Based on these findings, a reclassification of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors is warranted.", 
    "33": "To investigate central neurotransmitter function in depression, baseline levels of serum cortisol and prolactin and the responses of these hormones to the putative serotonin agonist fenfluramine (60 mg, oral) were examined in 27 depressed patients and 14 normal subjects. Baseline cortisol was significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) in depressed subjects, whilst baseline prolactin was significantly reduced (P = 0.01) after covarying for cortisol. Although there were no significant abnormalities in either the prolactin or the cortisol response to fenfluramine in the total depressed group, the peak increase in prolactin levels (delta PRL) was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) in subjects with endogenous depression. Analysis of covariance demonstrated, however, that the reduced delta PRL was partially dependent upon the abnormal baseline prolactin and cortisol levels. These results indicate the necessity of accounting for these baseline effects when investigating hormonal responses to the putative serotonergic challenges. The abnormal baseline findings are consistent with increased central noradrenergic activity in depression.", 
    "34": "Meta-analysis is a term used to describe statistical methods for evaluating a series of research reports; this analysis transcends the limitations that may be inherent in each of the individual studies summarized. Forty-five research reports of clinical trials for the prevention of myalgias after succinylcholine were assembled. Four classes of preventive drugs (nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, succinylcholine in \"self-taming\" doses, and local anesthetics) were reported in detail sufficient to allow for inclusion in a meta-analysis of clinical efficacy. Each study was summarized by determining the difference in the incidence of myalgias on the first postoperative day between treatment and control groups. A random-effects variance components approach was used. Seven meta-analyses were performed (atracurium, d-tubocurarine, gallamine, pancuronium, diazepam, succinylcholine in self-taming doses, and lidocaine). For each meta-analysis there was statistically significant heterogeneity among studies. Atracurium, d-tubocurarine, gallamine, pancuronium, diazepam, and lidocaine all significantly decreased the frequency of myalgias by about 30%. Succinylcholine in self-taming doses alone was not efficacious.", 
    "35": "The pharmacokinetics of diazepam and its major active metabolite, desmethyl-diazepam, following a loading dose of diazepam (fixed oral doses of 20 mg) were studied in 16 patients on alcohol withdrawal. No toxic drug levels were measured irrespective of the amount of diazepam needed on the loading (83 +/- 27 mg on average). The mean elimination half-life of diazepam fell within the range observed in healthy persons after the ingestion of therapeutic doses (5), or it was only moderately prolonged (t1/2 49.7 h). The ageing process was associated with a slightly prolonged half-life of diazepam. Standard liver function tests could not predict the length of the elimination half-life of diazepam. Active drug concentrations remained high during the first 48 h of treatment, followed by a steady decline. On the basis of this study, it seems that diazepam can be safely and effectively used in loading doses in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "36": "A technique is described for the anaesthetic management of trigeminal nerve thermocoagulation by administration of repeated doses of midazolam and flumazenil. \"Wake-up\" times after administration of flumazenil in 20 patients were shorter than those reported during spontaneous recovery from methohexitone or propofol anaesthesia. The midazolam dose required for a second phase of sedation after antagonism of the first with flumazenil was significantly less than that for the first phase of sedation. There was no evidence of postoperative resedation. Reversal of sedation was associated with an increase in arterial pressure.", 
    "37": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical study was performed in 69 outpatients scheduled for endoscopy and sedated with midazolam to assess the efficacy, safety, and usefulness of flumazenil in reversing the effects of midazolam-induced sedation. Midazolam was administered intravenously before endoscopy up to a maximum dose of 15 mg. After endoscopy either flumazenil or placebo was injected. Vital signs and psychomotoric tests were assessed before injection of midazolam, before injection of flumazenil or placebo, and 5, 15, 30, 60, 240, and 360 min afterward. Thirty-six patients received flumazenil, 33 placebo. All parameters returned to pre-sedation levels within 5 min in all patients in the flumazenil group, with significant differences as compared with placebo after 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Flumazenil was well tolerated. No rebound sedation was observed. Flumazenil is a safe and effective benzodiazepine antagonist. The combination of midazolam with flumazenil makes it possible to reduce the recovery period and is useful in outpatient endoscopy.", 
    "38": "1. Conditions were examined under which estimates of drug clearance made from a single measurement of plasma concentration effectively represented multiple-sample estimates of clearance for quinidine, valproic acid, unbound valproic acid, and lorazepam. When plasma concentrations were measured at various post-dose times, both individual and mean values of single-sample clearance estimates, CL, corresponded closely to multiple-sample clearance estimates. Best post-dose sampling times were: quinidine, 8 h; valproic acid, 24 h; and lorazepam, 24 h. 2. Single-sample clearance estimates, CL, were calculated for seven drugs employed as probes of human hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Valproic acid was used to probe microsomal and peroxisomal beta-oxidase activity; antipyrine, phenytoin, quinidine, carbamazepine, and theophylline were used as probes of hepatic mixed-function oxidases (MFO), and lorazepam as a probe for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. 3. A clearance index (CI, namely probe CL for smokers divided by probe CL for non-smokers) was calculated for each probe. The effect of cigarette smoking (and presumably polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure) on all probe CL values was consolidated and plotted as the logarithm of the CI to produce a handprint of drug metabolizing enzyme activity for cigarette smokers. 4. Only theophylline CL was significantly faster among smokers than non-smokers (P less than 0.01). 5. We conclude that the use of multiple probes of MFO activity when given in a single-dose, single-sample protocol for structuring handprints represents a minimally invasive and useful approach to characterize xenobiotic-mediated effects on hepatic MFO.", 
    "39": "Ro 15-1788 (0.5, 1, 5, or 20 mg/kg), a pure benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, was studied for its effect on the duration of immobility and the number of straw-climbing attempts in a modified forced-swim test with straw-suspension of rats. A single dose of 20 mg/kg of Ro 15-1788 injected IP prolonged only the duration of immobility with no effect on straw-climbing behavior, whereas both doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg of this compound significantly enhanced the number of straw-climbing attempts in an inverted U-shaped manner. Ro 15-1788 at 1 mg/kg significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of 1 mg/kg of diazepam on the number of straw-climbing attempts. It is suggested that the enhancing effect of low doses of Ro 15-1788 on straw-climbing behavior can be regarded as an index of its anxiogenic effect, by acting via central benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "40": "Rats were trained in a fine motor control performance that required operation by a paw of a force transducer so that it remained between upper and lower limits of a force band for a continuous 1.5-sec period to deliver each food pellet. Acute doses of midazolam (0.75-3.0 mg/kg, SC) impaired indices of motor performance in a graded, dose-related fashion. When administered alone, Ro 15-1788 (0.1-5.0 mg/kg, SC) had no effect on motor behavior while CGS 8216 (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, IP) alone had small effects. In general, the motor performance decrements produced by midazolam were antagonized in a dose-related fashion by both Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216.", 
    "41": "The abilities of the ACE inhibitors captopril and SQ29,852 to modify aversive behaviour was compared to the effects of diazepam in the light/dark exploration test in the mouse, the elevated plus maze and social interaction test in the rat, and in anxiety-related behaviours induced by human threat in the marmoset. In the four tests the acute administration of captopril, SQ29,852 and diazepam had the same profiles of action to reduce aversive responding. This was also observed during chronic administration with the three agents in the mouse. However, withdrawal from a chronic treatment with diazepam precipitated a syndrome of increased aversion, whereas withdrawal from treatment with captopril and SQ29,852 was uneventful, values waning to control levels. Withdrawal from treatment with ethanol, nicotine and cocaine also enhanced aversive responding. Treatment with captopril and SQ29,852 antagonised the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from treatment with diazepam and nicotine and SQ29,852 also blocked the consequences of withdrawal from ethanol and cocaine. It is concluded that captopril and SQ29,852 have an anxiolytic profile of action in 3 species, that cessation of treatment is not associated with a withdrawal syndrome, that the ACE inhibitors cross tolerate with diazepam and can antagonise the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from treatment with drugs of abuse.", 
    "42": "Timing or intensity of shocks significantly modify the characteristics of the analgesia induced by footshock, and conditioning to footshock induces analgesia, independently from the time and shock parameters used for conditioning. However, whatever the parameters of shock, and the presence of conditioning or not, the stress has to be inescapable in order to produce an increase in pain thresholds. This observation suggests that anxiety plays a major role in the development of stress-induced analgesia. In order to test this hypothesis we investigated the effects of the benzodiazepine agonists diazepam and clonazepam, the antagonists RO 15-1788, CGS 8216, CGS 9896, and the inverse agonists FG 7142 and FG 7041 on the development and maintenance of stress-induced analgesia. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists decreased the analgesic effect of inescapable footshock, benzodiazepine receptor antagonists increased the footshock induced analgesia, whereas inverse agonists did not modify the analgesia induced by the shock. All the benzodiazepine receptor ligands blocked the antagonism of the footshock analgesia induced by naloxone.", 
    "43": "56 female patients with breast carcinoma and treated with polychemotherapy: adriamycin, vindesine, ciclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil were studied, divided in three groups with different antiemetic schedule: group A 40 mg/iv of metoclopramide; group B 40 mg iv of metoclopramide and 125 mg/iv of methylprednisolone before beginning chemotherapy; and group C 2 mg/oral of lorazepam, 125 mg/iv methyl-prednisolone and 1 mg/kg/oral of metoclopramide previously to begin chemotherapy; at two and four hours of the first dose, metoclopramide was repeated the same doses (really) three doses each two hours. The combination of methylprednisolone-metoclopramide (B), decreases significantly the intensity, duration and frequency of nausea and vomiting, achieving total protection (no vomiting) in 4.34% of cycles of chemotherapy in group A, 32.2% in group B and 30.2% in group C (p less than 0.005 group A versus group B and A versus group C). Also we observed, without statistical analysis, better subjective tolerance to chemotherapy in patients receiving lorazepam associated to schedule B (schedule C). This makes it the recommended schedule.", 
    "44": "Rectal administration of diazepam is a good alternative to intravenous acute treatment in severe epileptic crises, but there is scarce information about its usefulness in status epilepticus. Treatment with rectal diazepam, 0.6 to 0.8 mg x kg of body weight as a single drug, in 10 children with 13 episodes of status epilepticus, defined as epileptic crises lasting 30 or more minutes (ten of these were generalized tonic and clonic, two were unilateral tonic and clonic, and one was of the partial complex type) is described. Nine status epilepticus episodes subsided at an average 4.4 minutes after the drug was given; in 3 cases there were no favourable effects, and one case recurred after initial response. There were no significant complications, with the exception of slight respiratory depression in a patient with encephalitis. In spite of the small size of the sample, these results suggest that rectal diazepam is an effective alternative to intravenous drug administration in the management of status epilepticus whenever venous access is difficult.", 
    "45": "Ninety patients were included in a study to assess the clinical characteristics of vecuronium bromide used in children. The myorelaxant was administered to all patients using different routes. The use of vecuronium at a dose approximately equal to 1ED95 was characterised by a duration of action sufficient to allow its use in short operations; on the other hand, it also produced a long induction-intubation interval and not optimal conditions in which to perform intubation. Conditions for intubation improved during induction via inhalation and there was a reduced induction-intubation interval compared to intravenous induction using the same dose of vecuronium. A further reduction in intubation time was obtained by increasing the dose from 50 to 150 micrograms/kg-1 together with an increased clinical duration of action. The \"priming principle\" technique also allowed intubation time to be shortened without variations in the duration of action provided a full dose of vecuronium, 100 micrograms/kg-1, was used. However, this was also associated with a notable incidence of adverse reactions. Of the various combinations examined, the most advantageous association of pre-dose and interval between doses was the association of a pre-dose of 10 micrograms/kg-1 and an interval of 4 min between doses. Lower doses countered the advantages of priming, whereas higher doses resulted in an increased number of adverse reactions without producing notable changes in the intubation time.", 
    "46": "The spontaneous forgetting model has been used to demonstrate the possibility of the memory forgetten trace extraction under the dopamine reuptake blockade by nomifensine and bupropion, increase of its quantity by amfonelic acid, activation of the postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors by (+)3-PPP, blockade of the latter by (-)3-PPP, and under the blockade of separate links of the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex by bicuculline, picrotoxin, flumazepil and R015-3505. Effectiveness of the neuropharmacological actions improving the memory forgotten trace retrieval is shown to depend upon the duration of the spontaneous forgetting process. The presynaptic receptors are involved in the retrieval process control--improvement of the conditioned habit performance after forgetting due to the activation of presynaptic dopaminergic receptors by specific agonist (-)3-PPP is clearly correlated with the initial retrieval level. The above facts underlie a hypothesis about the neurochemical forgetting mechanisms.", 
    "47": "Nowadays, two major therapeutic approaches (pharmacological and behavioural) have proven their efficiency and efficacy in the treatment of anxious disorders. These two methods have been used separately, alternatively or simultaneously. The prescription of benzodiazepines is necessary, because they are efficient and fast-acting. But this is not enough and may be hazardous for a prolonged period. Behavioural methodology and therapeutics improve the assessment of anxious disorders and offer a large variety of specific techniques to the physician. The innovative and integrative behavioural prescription (BP) is pragmatic and reliable. For instance, drugs are markers for assessment of anxious behaviours, in an agenda and may be used both to support functional analysis, and as agents of therapeutic contracts. The synergic action of behavioural prescription is clear in three dimensions: BP deepens muscle relaxation and gives better self-control and self-regulation of arousal level. BP alleviates social inhibition by developing social skills. BP modifies cognitions and affective disorders, which is necessary for permanent results and drug withdrawal. Other applications of BP will be considered in the future.", 
    "48": "The effects of the 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative flutoprazepam on the skills essential for driving motor vehicles were tested 2.5 h after intake of 1 x 2 mg and 1 x 4 mg, comparing with placebo. 18 healthy subjects who had homogeneous results in psychological/physical tests took part in the study. The study had a double-blind, randomized crossover design with 7-day washout periods. 2.5 h after intake of 4 mg flutoprazepam, the ability to drive was impaired. Only a very slight reduction in skill was found at the same time under the influence of 2 mg of the drug.", 
    "49": "A study of the extent of hospital inpatient prescribing of benzodiazepines and their continuation at discharge was carried out on all patients admitted to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, during a 7-day period. A large majority (73.6%) were not prescribed benzodiazepines at any time. No discharge prescriptions for these drugs were initiated in hospital. The data do not suggest that hospital prescribing of benzodiazepines is contributing to community prescribing.", 
    "50": "Alpidem, an imidazo-pyridine compound, has been evaluated as an anxiolytic in comparison with placebo and lorazepam. In the first of our normal volunteer studies, we compared single doses of alpidem, 25, 50 and 100 mg with lorazepam 2 mg and placebo on a range of cognitive, psychomotor and EEG variables. Lorazepam and the highest (100 mg) dose of alpidem impaired performance on a range of psychomotor tasks, the effects of the benzodiazepine being more severe and more prolonged. No impairment of performance was observed with the 25 and 50 mg doses. In the second study, the focus was on memory functions. Lorazepam, 2 mg, caused anterograde amnesia which was most apparent 1 h post-drug but persisted until 4 h: sedation was marked. By contrast, single doses (25, 50 mg) of alpidem had little effect on either memory or alertness. The third study compared the effects of alpidem (25, 50 mg) and lorazepam (1 mg) with placebo, each given twice-daily for 8 days to normal volunteers. On the final day, a test dose of ethanol was given. Lorazepam impaired many tests of cognitive and psychomotor function, and this impairment was enhanced by ethanol. By contrast, alpidem produced less impairment with less interaction with alcohol. In a fourth, clinical, study, 24 patients with a DSM III primary diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder were treated, under double blind conditions, with doses adjusted according to clinical need of either alpidem 25-150 mg daily or lorazepam 1-6 mg daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of alpidem, a new imidazopyridine derivative with benzodiazepine-like anxiolytic effects, with those of lorazepam and placebo on memory and attention in two age groups of healthy volunteers. The study design was that of a randomized double-blind crossover trial with 12 young (18-30 years old) and 12 elderly (65-80) subjects. At weekly intervals, each subject was administered single oral doses of 25 mg alpidem, 50 mg alpidem, 1 mg lorazepam, and placebo in a randomized sequence. Computerized memory and attention tests were performed 90 minutes before and 320 minutes after drug administration. Lorazepam and alpidem 50 mg produced memory impairments: for verbal memory tests the difference against placebo was highly significant for both drugs, while for visual memory this impairment was significant for lorazepam only. No memory effects were seen with 25 mg alpidem. There were no significant drug effects on attention, suggesting a specific amnestic effect not explained by general sedation. Performance of the elderly subjects was much lower than that of the younger ones in both memory and attention tasks. It was not possible to observe any interaction effects between drug and age.", 
    "52": "Pharmacological and behavioral studies in mice and rats have shown that the imidazopyridine alpidem possesses anxiolytic activity with a profile which is substantially different from that of benzodiazepines. Thus, in mice, alpidem inhibited marble-burying behavior and enhanced feeding under stressful conditions, as did benzodiazepines; in contrast to these drugs, however, alpidem was inactive against shock-induced fighting and shock-suppressed exploration. In rats, alpidem exerted anticonflict activity in the punished drinking test, but failed to antagonize punishment-induced inhibition of operant behavior. Moreover, in rats trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide from saline, alpidem did not produce a benzodiazepine-like interoceptive stimulus. Alpidem also produced anticonvulsant effects in a variety of tests sensitive to benzodiazepines. However, the order of potencies against convulsions induced by different convulsive agents was different from that of the benzodiazepines. Alpidem decreased motor performance in the rotarod test and only produced a deficit in muscle strength at doses which were more than 20 times higher than the doses active in anxiolytic tests. Moreover, alpidem did not interfere with the acquisition of conditioned fear, except at very high doses, indicating a weak potential to impair memory. The effects of alpidem were antagonized by flumazenil, indicating that central omega receptors are involved in the action of this drug. The weak sedative effects of alpidem may be attributed to its low intrinsic activity, as demonstrated by its low efficacy in increasing latency to isoniazid-induced convulsions.", 
    "53": "The names omega 1-, omega 2-, and omega 3-receptor subtypes have recently been proposed to replace the nomenclature of BZ1, BZ2 and BZp receptors in order to avoid a nomenclature exclusively linked to the benzodiazepine (BZ) structure or to a regional localization. The multiplicity of pharmacological actions of currently available anxiolytics may be due to their lack of selectivity for omega-receptor subtypes. The idea that a receptor-subtype selective drug will offer a more specific therapeutic profile is widely accepted. In the field of preferential anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs, imidazopyridines represent a new chemical and therapeutic class possessing selectivity for omega-receptor subtypes. Of these, alpidem (6-chloro-2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-N,N-dipropylimid-azo[1,2-a] pyridine-3-acetamide) behaves preferentially as an anxiolytic drug in both animal models and man. Receptor-binding studies using alpidem either as a displacer or as a radioligand indicate that the compound has a high affinity for omega 1- and for omega 3- but not for omega 2-receptors. In the human brain, the binding of [3H]-alpidem to omega 1- and omega 3-receptors occurs with a Kd of 1.67 nM and 0.33 nM respectively. The binding of [3H]-alpidem to omega 1-receptors in the rat cerebral cortex with a Kd of 1.5 nM is enhanced by GABA, and in contrast to anxiolytics of the benzodiazepine type, is unaffected by chloride ions and pentobarbital. In conclusion, the affinity of alpidem for the omega 1-receptor is allosterically influenced by the activation of the GABAA receptor but not by other components of the same receptor complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "As part of a program of postmarketing surveillance, the use of flumazenil was monitored prospectively in a New Zealand public hospital for a period of twelve months. A questionnaire on usage, efficacy and side-effects was completed by clinicians for 118 patients receiving the drug. Our conclusions are these: 1. Flumazenil was used most frequently after anaesthesia and in the initial management of intentional drug overdose. 2. In two-thirds of cases, flumazenil was used to antagonise benzodiazepines in the presence of non-benzodiazepine drugs and its efficacy was primarily determined by the presence of these latter drugs. 3. The complications of flumazenil are mild although important complications may arise from interaction with other drugs and unmasking of conditions such as postoperative pain. 4. Resedation was common (24%), although rarely a problem unless large doses of benzodiazepine agonist had been administered or if other hypnosedatives were given subsequently.", 
    "55": "All long term benzodiazepine users in one inner London general practice were asked to participate in a study of their attitudes to their drugs. The 64 respondents had mixed views about benzodiazepines and did not conform to the stereotype presented in the media. Although 58% of the sample had attempted to stop taking benzodiazepines, this was usually not until at least one year of taking the drug. At the time of interview, 50% of the sample expressed a desire to stop taking their tablets. However, the majority were uncertain whether their general practitioner wished them to continue taking the drugs or not. It is argued that users' views of their medication must be taken into account in the debate about tranquillizer dependence.", 
    "56": "This study assessed potential teratogenic properties of benzodiazepine (BZD) intake during early pregnancy. Four neonatal diagnoses of congenital malformations (embryopathy and fetopathy, unspecified; unspecified congenital malformations of the nervous system; cleft palate and cleft lip; congenital malformations of the urinary tract) were selected. The authors' previous clinical experience had shown these diagnoses to be characteristic of infants born to mothers with excessive intake of BZD in early pregnancy. The selected diagnoses were present in 25 of 10,646 liveborn infants (2.3 per 1000) delivered by mothers living in the city of Gothenburg in 1985 and 1986. In 18 of these cases, it was possible to analyse maternal plasma, and eight samples (44 per cent) were found to be BZD-positive. Of 60 controls, two maternal blood samples (3 per cent) were positive for BZD. The difference is highly significant and suggests an association between these congenital malformations and BZD consumed during early gestation.", 
    "57": "The effects of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists have been determined on \"sleeping time\" in the rat--that is, with the animal immobile and adopting a sleeping posture. Alterations in their gross behaviour patterns were assessed also. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (yohimbine, WY 26393, RX 781094 and RS 21361) decreased sleeping time, as did the beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine gave a large increase in sleeping time at doses in excess of 25 micrograms kg-1. The same effect was seen with the beta-antagonist propranolol and the specific beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551.", 
    "58": "Practicing physicians need to have practical techniques to help patients who want to stop using benzodiazepines. I have developed three approaches that usually work. The first, and most widely applicable, is gradually reducing the dose without adding any other medicine. Failing this, use one of the following two approaches, occasionally combining them: switch to a longer-acting, cross-tolerant medication (usually clonazepam or phenobarbital) or use medications to suppress the withdrawal symptoms, usually carbamazepine, propranolol, or clonidine. If this fails, use inpatient detoxification. Chemically dependent patients, including those abusing alcohol and taking higher than recommended doses of sedative-hypnotics, require special care during discontinuation. Aftercare is important for all long-term benzodiazepine users if they are to remain drug-free and live relatively comfortable lives.", 
    "59": "A self-report questionnaire is described which records the main symptoms experienced during withdrawal from benzodiazepines in pharmacologically dependent patients. The questionnaire consists of 20 items; evidence is given that these are reasonably independent and are sensitive in detecting withdrawal symptoms from a study of 68 patients undergoing slow withdrawal from benzodiazepines.", 
    "60": "A multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of estazolam compared with flurazepam as hypnotics. Outpatients complaining of insomnia were randomized to receive either estazolam 2 mg, flurazepam 30 mg or placebo for 7 consecutive nights. The analysis of efficacy was based on the patients' daily assessments of sleep and the investigators' global evaluations. Adverse events which were considered by the investigator to be attributable to, or of unknown relationship to the test medication were analyzed. The patient subjective questionnaire indicated that estazolam and flurazepam significantly improved all parameters (P less than .05) as compared to placebo. A marked or moderate improvement in sleep was reported by 81% (58/72), 78% (63/81) and 36% (27/76) of estazolam, flurazepam, and placebo recipients, respectively. There were no significant differences in hypnotic effect between estazolam and flurazepam. All efficacy parameters of the investigators' global evaluation improved significantly more (P less than .05) for patients receiving estazolam or flurazepam (except quality of sleep) than for those receiving placebo. The percentage of patients reporting any adverse experience was greatest for flurazepam (72%), followed by estazolam (59%), and placebo (43%). Somnolence and hypokinesia were the most commonly reported adverse events. An analysis of the global evaluation of side effects showed that flurazepam had a significantly worse side effect profile than estazolam (P less than .05) or placebo (P = .001). Estazolam and flurazepam effectively, and comparably, relieved insomnia when administered for 7 nights in adult patients complaining of insomnia. Estazolam demonstrated a more favorable side effect profile than flurazepam.", 
    "61": "Reconstitution of striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic systems was studied in intrastriatal grafts derived from embryonic day 15 rat striatal primordia and implanted into adult host rats in which unilateral ibotenic acid lesions had previously been made in the striatum. Histochemical, immunohistochemical, and ligand binding autoradiographic techniques were applied to analyze different constituents of these two systems and to study their locations relative to each other in grafts allowed to grow for 9-17 months following transplantation. For the cholinergic system, a modular organization was found in the striatal grafts with stains for choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase, respectively the synthetic and degradative enzymes for cholinergic neurons; by autoradiographic [3H]hemicholinium binding, specific for high affinity choline uptake sites associated with cholinergic terminals; and by autoradiographic [3H]pirenzepine binding, selective for M1 receptors. For the dopaminergic system, a comparable modular organization was found in the grafts by immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase, the catecholamine synthetic enzyme; by autoradiographic [3H]mazindol binding for dopamine uptake sites; and by [3H]SCH23390 binding for dopamine D1 receptors and [3H]sulpiride binding for dopamine D2 receptors. The results indicate that the distributions of the cholinergic and dopaminergic markers in striatal grafts are in close anatomical register. These markers for intracellular and membrane-associated components of the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems were preferentially localized in the acetylcholesterase-rich patches of the grafts in which cortical and thalamic fibers have also been found in striatal grafts, and in which output neurons projecting to the pallidum are located. This anatomical correlation suggests that the substrates for cholinergic-dopaminergic interactions typical of the normal striatum may be reinstated in the grafts both in relation to efferent neurons establishing connections with the host brain that are typical of normal striatofugal connections, and in relation to major afferent fiber systems from the host brain originating in regions known to project densely to the normal striatum. Accordingly, the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems in such grafts may regulate the functional influence of the grafts on the behavior of host animals.", 
    "62": "Microsomes prepared from livers of male and female rats of nine inbred and outbred strains and of male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with monooxygenase-inducing agents were used to study N-dealkylation of diazepam and temazepam and C3-hydroxylation of diazepam and nordazepam. Both C3-hydroxylation reactions were more rapid in male than in female liver preparations, but this gender-dependent pattern was not seen with the N-dealkylation reactions. These results indicate the lack of identity of the monooxygenases responsible for the two kinds of reaction and suggest that male-specific enzyme(s) are responsible for the C3-hydroxylations. Induction studies were undertaken to further define these enzymes. To do this, liver microsomes prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with a variety of agents known to have different monooxygenase induction effects were used. With triacetyloleandomycin, dexamethasone, and phenobarbital pretreatment, the specific activities of the C3-hydroxylation reactions were selectively elevated over corresponding control values. These particular xenobiotics are known to enhance the abundance of cytochrome P450IIIA family enzymes, and our results strongly suggest the involvement of these enzymes in the benzodiazepine B ring monooxygenations. Formation of temazepam was also shown to be inhibited by triacetyloleandomycin. This effect was demonstrated to be equal in both saline-treated and dexamethasone-treated male Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes, with the antibiotic present either with diazepam throughout the entire incubation period or initially with NADPH in a preincubation mix for 15 min, following which C3-hydroxylation was initiated by the addition of diazepam. These results confirm the uniformity of the involvement of cytochrome P450IIIA family enzymes in diazepam C3-hydroxylation in untreated and inducer-treated rat liver microsomes. Recent studies with human and rabbit liver microsomal preparations have shown that orthologues of these enzymes also catalyze an equivalent hydroxylation in the B ring of midazolam. These findings, considered with the present results showing that the adjacent methyl N-substituent (absent in nordazepam but present in diazepam) did not affect the selectivity of these enzymes for the C3-hydroxylation reaction, suggest that neither steric nor electronic factors markedly influence catalysis of this monooxygenation by these enzymes.", 
    "63": "The author reviews the role of high-frequency benzodiazepines in the treatment of psychosis. Lorazepam and clonazepam are of established value in controlling acute psychotic agitation and catatonia. These agents have also been shown to be helpful in managing neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Recent data strongly support an adjunctive role for alprazolam in the treatment of neuroleptic-resistant symptoms in a subgroup of chronic schizophrenics. Separate, though overlapping, profiles of clinical efficacy are described for the three currently available agents. Alprazolam is suggested to be useful in depressive psychosis and clonazepam in manic psychosis. Lorazepam is suggested to be without specific \"mood-normalizing\" effects.", 
    "64": "Interest in benzodiazepines for treatment of panic attacks followed a report of the success of alprazolam, used for generalized anxiety, in blocking such attacks. Twelve controlled trials and several open studies have substantiated the antipanic and antiphobic activity of alprazolam and concluded it is comparable to but more rapid than antidepressants in its effects and better tolerated. In a controlled trial of clonazepam, alprazolam, and placebo, the two active agents had similar positive effects. Diazepam and lorazepam have been effective in other studies. Clonazepam, with its relatively long half-life, permits less frequent dosing than possible with benzodiazepines with shorter half-lives and more continuous control of anxiety, although around 20% of patients experience unacceptable sedative effects or no reduction in anxiety. In general, benzodiazepines are safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are intoxication, dependence, rebound, withdrawal, hostility, and affective disturbances. Discontinuation of alprazolam is particularly difficult and is sometimes associated with serious rebound and withdrawal symptoms. The morbidity and mortality associated with panic disorder suggest that the benefits of benzodiazepine treatment outweigh its risks.", 
    "65": "The use of anticonvulsants as treatments for bipolar affective disorder is growing, and despite relatively scant data, anticonvulsants have become widely accepted as adjuncts to lithium therapy, particularly as alternatives to neuroleptics. Although most of the research work to date has involved carbamazepine, improvement in bipolar symptoms with clonazepam has been exhibited in controlled studies and case reports. The author summarizes studies done by the Bipolar Research Group of the Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. The data thus far indicate that clonazepam can be added to the treatment regimen of bipolar patients and apparently reduces cycle frequency; many patients using neuroleptics and lithium can be switched to lithium and clonazepam without suffering acute relapse; and clonazepam may be associated with fewer depressive recurrences than neuroleptic treatment.", 
    "66": "In adolescents, anxiety disorders may be manifested as juvenile anxiety syndromes, adult anxiety syndromes, or an adjustment disorder with anxious mood. In addition, depressive illnesses and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder often exist comorbidly with the primary anxiety disorder. The treatment of anxiety in adolescents should be multimodal, including psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions along with pharmacotherapy. Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors have been successful in most anxiety disorders, although both classes of drug are associated with significant adverse effects and require careful monitoring. Benzodiazepines are effective in juvenile anxiety disorders. Clonazepam's long duration of action and relatively benign side-effects profile make it an attractive agent in adolescent populations.", 
    "67": "The high-potency benzodiazepines have been effective in short-term treatment of panic disorder, but systematic investigation of their long-term efficacy and safety is necessary. In a 1-year follow-up study of patients continuing treatment with clonazepam, 90% maintained a positive response without developing significant tolerance. In a 2.5-year follow-up study of alprazolam therapy, little evidence of tolerance emerged and initial therapeutic gains were maintained, even among patients who decreased or discontinued medication. As with antidepressants, many patients remain on high-potency benzodiazepine medication after short-term treatment; the choice of maintenance agent should reflect side effects of treatment as well as the ease of discontinuation. The high-potency benzodiazepines are a reasonable alternative to antidepressants, which involve problems of morbidity, noncompliance, and risk for overdose. Discontinuation may be less difficult with the longer-acting high-potency benzodiazepines, which thus may be advantageous for long-term treatment. It is necessary to determine the contributions of all aspects of treatment, both behavioral and pharmacologic, to the longitudinal course of patients with panic disorders.", 
    "68": "Manifestations of anxiety, including panic disorder, are more common in the alcoholic population than in the general population. Alcoholics frequently abuse other drugs. The authors hypothesized that alcoholic subjects with panic attacks would abuse anxiolytic drugs more and panic-inducing drugs less frequently than nonanxious alcoholic subjects, and that their abuse of panic-inducing drugs would predate the age at panic onset. Findings indicate that alcoholic subjects with panic attacks (but not panic disorder) abused opiates and sedatives to a greater degree than nonanxious alcoholic subjects and abused marijuana, a panic-inducing drug, at a younger age. More alcoholic subjects with panic disorder than with panic attacks abused cocaine. The prevalence of abuse and the ages at onset of abuse of other drugs were similar for both the panic and the nonpanic group.", 
    "69": "A number of studies have shown significant interactions between neuronal systems involved with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and either the clinical manifestations of depression and anxiety or the effects of antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs. In the present study, effects of CRF were studied alone and in combination with imipramine and with the sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide. Interactions of CRF with the novel, atypical anxiolytic buspirone were also examined. Interactions were evaluated through the use of schedule-controlled responding, responding suppressed by punishment, and drug discrimination procedures using the conditioned key-pecking response of pigeons. Effects of CRF were significantly enhanced when given in combination with imipramine with low noneffective imipramine doses potentiating the rate-reducing effects of CRF. Similarly, in pigeons trained to discriminate imipramine from saline, noneffective doses of CRF shifted the imipramine dose-response curve more than twofold to the left. Low doses of imipramine that produced saline key responding, produced imipramine-key responding when coadministered with CRF. The CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 did not alter the rate-decreasing effects of imipramine. Effects of CRF on schedule-controlled responding were, however, antagonized by the administration of chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital but not by buspirone, suggesting that CRF interacts with the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor mechanism complex but not with those systems involved in mediating the effects of buspirone. These results suggest that CRF interacts in significant ways with specific neurotransmitter systems subserving depression and anxiety.", 
    "70": "In this study, we evaluated the mechanism of action whereby cholecystokinin increases spike-burst rate of the opossum sphincter of Oddi (SO). Each spike burst corresponds to a peristaltic SO contraction. Two types of animal preparations were evaluated: (1) awake chronic animal preparations and (2) anesthetized animals. A total of 19 chronic animals were prepared by implantation of electrodes on the SO, gastric antrum, duodenum, and jejunum. SO spike-burst rate was stimulated by intravenous infusion of CCK-OP (10 ng/kg/min), feeding, or intraduodenal infusion of fat-containing nutrient. Each stimulus was begun 20 min after cessation of phase III duodenal MMC activity and caused an increase in SO spike-burst rate from about 2 to 6/min that lasted for less than or equal to 1 hr. Such increases were antagonized substantially by hexamethonium, atropine, or methysergide. The CCK antagonist, L364718, antagonized the excitatory SO response to CCK-OP infusion or intraduodenal infusion of fat-containing nutrient (Isocal) but did not antagonize the response to feeding; CR1409 had no antagonistic effect on SO response to any of the three types of stimuli. In the acute studies in anesthetized animals, an intravenous bolus dose of CCK-OP (800 ng/kg) caused a substantial increase in SO spike-burst rate that was antagonized by CR1409 but not by atropine, hexamethonium, methysergide, L364718, or TTX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g., barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in humans and animals. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by these agents may be mediated through GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. This review attempts to summarize the evidence available as to how the GABA system plays a part in the barbiturate actions and the development of tolerance to and physical dependence on barbiturates. The comparisons of the effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines at different steps of GABA synapse are also presented. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in: (a) animal models used; (b) brain regions used; (c) protocols (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) used in treating animals and/or (d) techniques (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.) used.", 
    "72": "In previous studies, development of functional tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of clonazepam and physical dependence on the drug have been demonstrated. In the present study, dogs were treated for 6 weeks with clonazepam 0.5 mg/kg b.i.d. Under methohexital anesthesia, cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken before treatment, at 3 days (acute effect), 4 and 5 weeks (tolerance) after the start of treatment, 2 and 8 days after withdrawal and 5 weeks after the end of treatment as another control. The following transmitters or metabolites were determined: HVA, VMA, 5-HIAA, GABA, PGE2, TXB2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha. 5-HIAA levels showed a significant rise, indicating an increased activity of the serotonergic system in the brain during development both of tolerance and withdrawal. Dopaminergic activity was not altered during treatment, but was increased after cessation of treatment, as indicated by a significant increase in HVA concentrations.", 
    "73": "The binding and solubility of nitrofurantoin, piroxicam, indomethacin, prednisolone, diazepam, dicumarol, and griseofulvin in milk were determined at 15, 25, and 37 degrees C in bovine milk samples with fat contents of 0.75 and 3.50%. Drug binding to milk components was independent of drug concentration over the drug concentration studied, and the fat content of milk strongly affected binding values of most of the listed drugs. Further, drug binding increased with decreasing temperatures for most of the drugs examined. The solubility of all drugs is greatly enhanced in milk compared to their aqueous solubility (pH 6.5 phosphate buffer). The high solubility cannot be accounted for solely on the basis of drug binding to milk components. An attempt is made to correlate the binding and solubility data with physicochemical properties of the drugs (logP, pKa, aqueous solubility). The potential significance of these findings is discussed with regard to preparation and in vivo delivery of drugs from drug-milk formulations.", 
    "74": "Organophosphate compounds are widely employed for control of external parasites in cats and for control of insects in homes and yards. Chlorpyrifos is a long-acting organophosphate (OP) available for use as a systemically and topically acting parasiticide and insecticide in cattle. Its use on cats is not recommended, and no previous clinical cases of toxicosis have been described. Two cases of chronic chlorpyrifos toxicosis in cats are presented and pathophysiology as well as treatment are discussed. The cats had been showing signs of chronic organophosphate toxicosis before diazepam administration. Signs of acute organophosphate toxicosis were precipitated after diazepam was given. Treatment with pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) and atropine was attempted. Response to treatment was dramatic and complete recovery was achieved with six injections of pralidoxime and atropine administration.", 
    "75": "In previous reports, we have described the use of primary neuronal cultures derived from chick brain to study the regulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex. Chronic exposure of cultures to GABA, benzodiazepines, or methylxanthines results in decreased enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA, consistent with an allosteric uncoupling of GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites of the GABAA receptor. In the present communication, we extend our studies of the pharmacology of benzodiazepine- and methylxanthine-induced uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine recognition site interactions and present evidence to show that certain barbiturates (barbital and pentobarbital) also induce uncoupling. Chronic exposure to flurazepam (a high efficacy benzodiazepine) elicits no change in the number of benzodiazepine binding sites or the affinity of benzodiazepine binding in the absence of GABA. Whereas flurazepam and theophylline decrease coupling, Ro15-1788 (a low efficacy benzodiazepine) inhibits flurazepam-induced but not theophylline-induced uncoupling, suggesting that theophylline and flurazepam act through separate receptors. Flurazepam-induced uncoupling is not prevented by SR-95531 or picrotoxin (specific inhibitors of GABA action) and, therefore, is not an indirect effect mediated by endogenous GABA. The onset of flurazepam-induced uncoupling (EC50 approximately 1 microM) exhibits a t 1/2 of about 18 hr, in general agreement with the half-time for receptor turnover. Uncoupling is reversible following washout and recovery at 37 degrees. These results are discussed in terms of mechanisms of GABAA receptor regulation in response to chronic exposure to functionally homologous or heterologous ligands.", 
    "76": "The role of sialic acid residues in the interactions of muscarinic agonists with the cardiac M2 muscarinic receptor was investigated by competitive binding experiments using the lipophilic radioligand (-)-[benzilic-4,4-3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) and the hydrophilic ligand [N-methyl-3H]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3H]NMS). Direct labeling of the agonist binding sites was performed with the radiolabeled agonist [methyl-3H]oxotremorine M acetate ([3H]oxo-M). Neuraminidase decreased the affinity of the M2-selective agonist carbamylcholine in competitive binding experiments performed with [3H]QNB and [3H]NMS. The binding of the M1-selective agonist (4hydroxy-2-butynyl)trimethylammonium chloride m-chlorocarbanilate (McN-A-343), of the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine, and of the M2-selective antagonist 11-([2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1 piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3b)(1,4)benzodiazepin -6-on (AF-DX-116) were not affected by neuraminidase. Neuraminidase did not modify the binding parameters of 3H-antagonists but reduced the number of agonist binding sites revealed by [3H]oxo-M. The removal of sialic acid decreased the half-life of the receptor-agonist complex. The present results suggest that removal of sialic acid reduces the formation of super-high affinity agonist-receptor complexes. Sialic acid may catalyze macroscopic binding by enhancing accumulation of the agonist at the membrane surface.", 
    "77": "In order to test the GABA hypothesis of kindling, GABA-complex antagonists were administered in a dose-response paradigm to rats that had been implanted with indwelling forebrain electrodes, but not kindled. Focal seizures were then elicited from either the cortex or the amygdala to see whether kindling-like secondary generalization would occur. Norharmane, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, failed to promote secondary generalization from either the cortex or the amygdala. Bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, and picrotoxin, a chloride ionophore antagonist, enhanced generalization from both sites and, in amygdala-implanted subjects, appeared to produce a significant acceleration of kindling as well. Aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist tested for purposes of comparison, also enhanced secondary generalization from both sites, and in amygdala-implanted subjects produced long electrographic discharges which sometimes developed into status epilepticus.", 
    "78": "Similarities and differences in the actions of alcohols, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA-activated chloride channels are reviewed. This question has been approached using behavioral measures, the uptake of 36Cl- by isolated brain membranes and the function of GABA-activated chloride channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes using brain mRNA. Although drugs from all three classes augment GABA-dependent chloride conductances, there are a number of differences between these drugs. Studies of genetic differences in sensitivity to sedative drugs and development of tolerance and cross-tolerance between these drugs indicate that actions of ethanol are similar (but not identical) to those of benzodiazepines but are quite different from those of pentobarbital.", 
    "79": "Alterations in the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor system have been proposed as key factors in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). To date, the focus of research has been exclusively on the central-type neuronal receptor. However, astrocytes also possess BZD receptors which are of the peripheral-type. In recent studies we found an increased affinity of the astrocyte BZD receptor, using [3H]Ro5-4864 as the ligand, after treatment of cell cultures with ammonia, an agent strongly implicated in HE. The present study was undertaken to determine whether other suspected toxins in HE (phenol and octanoic acid) produce comparable effects. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to astrocyte homogenates showed a significant decrease in Bmax in cells that had been treated with 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mM phenol (46%, 58% and 68%, respectively). The same homogenates also showed a significant decrease in Kd after treatment with 0.5 mM phenol. No change in either affinity or receptor number was seen with 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mM sodium octanoate. Our results indicate that phenol, but not sodium octanoate, has an effect on the astrocyte BZD receptor. Thus, different agents that have been implicated in HE produce varying effects on the astrocytic BZD receptor. These findings suggest that the astrocyte benzodiazepine receptor may be involved in the pathogenesis of HE.", 
    "80": "Thirty-five patients over 14 years of age were evaluated, with the common feature of benzodiazepine poisoning, either as a single drug or associated with others and/or with ethanol, and who had a Glasgow score lower than 10 at admission. These patients were treated with flumazenil as a competitive antagonist drug. The results were very satisfactory. Subsequently, the possible relationship between the effect of flumazenil and the pharmacokinetic benzodiazepine profile was evaluated, and a significant relationship between the half life and the degree of resedation of the patients was found.", 
    "81": "The present study has been designed to investigate the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, ipsapirone (TVX Q 7821), a representative of a novel class of anxiolytics, and the classical benzodiazepine anxiolytic, diazepam, on cardiac and behavioural responses in an emotional stress situation. The emotional stress of fear of punishment, induced by training male Wistar rats in an inhibitory avoidance situation, was followed by a bradycardiac response relative to similarly trained, but non-punished, freely moving rats. The behavioural response of stressed rats was immobility in the dark compartment in which an electric footshock (0.6 mA a.c. for 3 s) had been administered as punishment a day earlier. Diazepam administered i.p. in doses of 2.5 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg caused a decrease in the interbeat interval (IBI) in shocked and non-shocked rats whereas ipsapirone administered i.p. in doses of 2.5 and 12.5 mg/kg decreased the IBI in shocked rats only. Ipsapirone diminished the duration of immobility in both shocked and non-shocked animals whereas diazepam decreased immobility in shocked rats only. These results suggest a differential effect of the two anxiolytics on the behavioural and cardiac responses to an emotional stress situation. It is suggested that ipsapirone has an anxiolytic-like effect and 'anti-stress' action that is clearly reflected in the cardiac physiology in an anxiety-inducing situation.", 
    "82": "Zolpidem and alpidem, two imidazopyridines with high affinity for the type I benzodiazepine recognition site, have recently been proposed as preferential hypnotic (zolpidem) and anxiolytic (alpidem) drugs notable for the minor incidence of side-effects. To further characterize the molecular mechanism involved in the action of these drugs, we studied their effects in comparison with those of diazepam on the spontaneous electrical activity of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) neurons. These cells have been shown to be extremely sensitive to various positive and negative modulators of GABAergic transmission. All three drugs consistently produced a dose-dependent (0.03-8.0 mg/kg i.v.) inhibition of the firing of SNR cells when administered as a single bolus. However, zolpidem was more potent and efficacious than diazepam or alpidem. The ID50s were 0.076, 0.492 and 0.821 mg/kg, respectively. When the drugs were injected in exponentially (ratio 2) increasing doses up to 8.0 mg/kg, the rank order for tachyphylaxis was zolpidem much greater than diazepam greater than alpidem. Since the effects of the drugs were abolished and prevented by a small dose (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) of flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), it is likely that the effects were mediated through activation of benzodiazepine receptors. The results indicate that the hypnotic, zolpidem, has a more potent inhibitory action on SNR cell activity than the anxiolytics, alpidem and diazepam.", 
    "83": "Alterations in a low affinity form of the GABAA receptor were examined with [3H]bicuculline methylchloride in the adult rat following perinatal exposure to diazepam. Perinatal exposure resulted in a significant reduction in [3H]bicuculline binding in the cingulate cortex. A significant decrease in the ability of GABA to displace bound [3H]bicuculline was observed only in the hypothalamus. The results suggest that the effects of perinatal exposure to diazepam are regionally specific and that benzodiazepine receptors and low affinity GABAA receptors are functionally linked during the perinatal period.", 
    "84": "The effect of diazepam on t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex was examined in the presence or absence of GABA. The in vitro addition of diazepam to unwashed membranes preparations (rich in endogenous GABA) decreased [35S]TBPS binding by 41%. On the contrary, diazepam produced an opposite effect (+28%) when GABA had been removed by extensive washes of membranes. Moreover, diazepam increased by 26% [35S]TBPS binding also in unwashed membrane preparations previously incubated with bicuculline. These results suggest that, in absence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), diazepam may have a paradoxical negative modulatory action on the function of the GABAA receptor-coupled chloride channels.", 
    "85": "In the conditioned burying paradigm, 10 mutually exclusive behavioral sequences were encoded in order to characterize the effects of various benzodiazepine receptor ligands. It was found that each ligand produced a specific behavioral pattern, the elements of which were consistent with results obtained in other experimental situations. Whereas anxiolytic (diazepam, Ro 16-6028) and 'anxiogenic' ligands (FG 7142) both decreased the mean duration of burying, these two classes of drugs largely differed when approaches to the prod and escape movements away from the prod were considered. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 was devoid of effects on all of the behavioral sequences considered. The main characteristics of these behavioral profiles persisted during an extinction test, although the animals were no longer treated. It is proposed that additional behavioral measures, or better, an ethological analysis of the behavior may increase the potency of the conditioned defensive burying paradigm."
