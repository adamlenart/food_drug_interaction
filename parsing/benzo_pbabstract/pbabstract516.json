    "0": "The distribution of the central omega 1 (benzodiazepine1; BZD1) and omega 2 (BZD2) receptor subtypes has been studied autoradiographically in monkey and human brain sections using [3H]flunitrazepam (which binds indiscriminately to omega 1 and omega 2 subtypes) and [3H]zolpidem (which recognizes selectively the omega 1 subtype). Both ligands labeled an homogeneous population of binding sites (Kd values approximately equal to 1.5 nM and approximately equal to 5 nM, respectively) whose pharmacological characteristics were similar to those of central omega (BZD) receptors. Regional displacement studies in monkey brain showed that zolpidem was a more effective displacer of [3H]flunitrazepam from omega 1-than from omega 2-enriched areas. For example, it was 73-fold more potent in the cerebellum (omega 1-enriched) than in the dentate gyrus (omega 2-enriched). Zolpidem thus selectively recognizes omega 1 sites in primate brain. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]flunitrazepam (omega 1 + omega 2) binding sites in primate brain was highly heterogeneous. Very high densities were observed in lamina IV of the neocortex (with higher densities in the occipital than in the frontal pole), the substantia innominata and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Intermediate densities were found in other neocortical laminae, cerebellum (molecular layer), claustrum, globus pallidus, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus (granular layer) and the majority of thalamic nuclei. Structures displaying low binding densities included the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. The regional distribution pattern of [3H]zolpidem binding sites was qualitatively similar to that of [3H]flunitrazepam but the relative density of the 3H-ligands differed in several brain regions. The relative density of omega 1 and omega 2 subtypes in each particular primate brain region was evaluated by measuring 1) the ratio of [3H]zolpidem to [3H]flunitrazepam binding; 2) [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the presence and in the absence of 100 nM zolpidem. With both approaches, a preferential enrichment in omega 1 sites was observed in lamina IV of sensorimotor cortical regions and in the extrapyramidal motor system (globus pallidus, ventral thalamic complex, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and cerebellum). In contrast, omega 2 sites predominated in limbic areas (e.g., the dentate gyrus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, cingulate and parahippocampal gyri) and in the anterior thalamic nucleus and caudate nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The existence of a benzodiazepine binding site in rat aortic smooth muscle membranes was explored employing [3H]Ro5-4864 as radioligand. The binding site was concentrated in the mitochondrial fraction enriched with cytochrome c oxidase and semicarbazide-insensitive monoamine oxidase. [3H]Ro5-4864 binds to the membranes in the mitochondrial fraction with high affinity. The dissociation constant (KD) determined by saturation binding was 2.8 +/- 0.7 nM (n = 5). The association rate constant (k1) was 4.7 +/- 0.8 x 10(6) M1 min-1, and the dissociation rate constant (k-1) was 0.028 +/- 0.005 min-1 (n = 3). The kinetically determined KD was 6.0 +/- 0.8 nM (n = 3) at 0.5 nM [3H]Ro5-4864. The density of binding determined from saturation binding experiments was 14.0 +/- 1.2 pmol/mg protein (n = 5). The Hill coefficient of binding was 0.94 +/- 0.02 (n = 5) indicating that [3H] Ro5-4864 binds to a single site. The [3H]Ro5-4864 binding was inhibited by Ro5-4864 (Ki = 6.1 +/- 1.9 nM), PK 11195 (Ki = 8.9 +/- 1.8 nM), diazepam (Ki = 87.3 +/- 3.4 nM), flunitrazepam (Ki = 94.6 +/- 1.8 nM), clonazepam (Ki = 6.3 +/- 1.3 microM) and Ro15-1788 (Ki = 16.8 +/- 1.5 microM). The rank order of potency of the competitive inhibition of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding (Ro5-4864 = PK 11195 greater than diazepam = flunitrazepam much greater than clonazepam greater than Ro15-1788) is characteristic of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site. The data indicate an abundant high affinity peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site of unknown function in rat aortic smooth muscle cells.", 
    "2": "The relationship between anxiety and depression may be more than the simultaneous expression of two commonly observed but distinct emotional states. Clinical studies suggest that anxiety is not only accompanied by symptoms of depression but may be an expected precursor syndrome in the development of at least some forms of depression. Recent genetic and epidemiological data further indicate that at least some forms of anxiety and depression may represent different phenotypic manifestations of the same genetic predisposition resulting from varying environmental conditions. Animal studies further suggest a causal relationship between anxiety and the development of a behavioral syndrome called \"learned helplessness,\" an animal model of depression produced by exposing the animal to inescapable stress. Many of the behavioral and physiological features of the syndrome resemble those observed in depressed patients. Recent findings show that the administration to rats of anxiogenic inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex produces the same behavioral syndrome evoked by inescapable stress. Moreover, pretreating animals with benzodiazepine anxiolytics can completely prevent the development of learned helplessness after exposure to inescapable stress. Together, the data suggest a common neurobiological substrate for some forms of anxiety and depression.", 
    "3": "Partially purified preparations of GABAa/benzodiazepine receptor from rat brain were found to contain high levels of a protein kinase activity that phosphorylated a small number of proteins in the receptor preparations, including a 50-kilodalton (kD) phosphoprotein that comigrated on two-dimensional electrophoresis with purified, immunolabeled, and photolabeled receptor alpha subunit. Further evidence that the comigrating 50-kD phosphoprotein was, in fact, the receptor alpha subunit was obtained by peptide mapping analysis: the 50-kD phosphoprotein yielded one-dimensional peptide maps identical to those obtained from iodinated, purified alpha subunit. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the receptor alpha subunit is phosphorylated on serine residues by the protein kinase activity present in receptor preparations. Preliminary characterization of the receptor-associated protein kinase activity suggested that it may be a second messenger-independent protein kinase. Protein kinase activity was unaltered by cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, calcium plus calmodulin, calcium plus phosphatidylserine, and various inhibitors of these protein kinases. Examination of the substrate specificity of the receptor-associated protein kinase indicated that the enzyme preferred basic proteins as substrates. Endogenous phosphorylation experiments indicated that the receptor alpha subunit may also be phosphorylated in crude membranes by a protein kinase activity present in those membranes. As with phosphorylation of the receptor in purified preparations, its phosphorylation in crude membranes also appeared to be unaffected by activators and inhibitors of second messenger-dependent protein kinases. These findings raise the possibility that the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the GABAa/benzodiazepine receptor by a receptor-associated protein kinase plays a role in modulating the physiological activity of the receptor in vivo.", 
    "4": "We examined the effects of in vivo hypoxia (10% O2/90% N2) on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptors and on glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity in the rat brain. Male Wistar rats were exposed to a mixture of 10% O2 and 90% N2 in a chamber for various periods (3, 6, 12, and 24 h). The control rats were exposed to room air. The brain regions examined were the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. GABA and benzodiazepine receptors were assessed using [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam, respectively. Compared with control values, GAD activity was decreased significantly following a 6-h exposure to hypoxia in all four regions studied. On the other hand, the numbers of both [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites were increased significantly. The increase in receptor number tended to return to control values after 24 h. Treatment of the membrane preparations with 0.05% Triton X-100 eliminated the increase in the binding capacity. These results may represent an up-regulation of postsynaptically located GABA/benzodiazepine receptors corresponding to the impaired presynaptic activity under hypoxia.", 
    "5": "It has been demonstrated previously that select Type II pyrethroids are potent proconvulsants in the rat and that the proconvulsant actions of deltamethrin are blocked by administration of PK 11195, an antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR). The present investigation has extended these findings to include various Type I pyrethroids as proconvulsants. Additionally, the proconvulsant activity of cismethrin was reversed by administration of PK 11195. Pyrethroid displacement of specific [3H]Ro5-4864 binding to rat brain membranes was investigated to further define the interaction of pyrethroids with the PTBR. Both Type I and Type II pyrethroids potently inhibited [3H]Ro5-4864 binding with affinities ranging from nanomolar to micromolar. The ED50 values for the proconvulsant effects of both Type I and Type II pyrethroids were significantly correlated with their respective IC50 values as inhibitors of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding. [3H]Ro5-4864 saturation isotherms performed in the presence of fixed concentrations of deltamethrin or cismethrin showed that these pyrethroids increased the observed Kd values for [3H]Ro5-4864 with no change in the maximum number of binding sites. However, Schild plot analysis of the effect of deltamethrin on [3H]Ro5-4864 affinity was nonlinear with the Kd shift approaching a limiting value. Considered together these results suggest an allosteric effect of pyrethroids on [3H]Ro5-4864 binding, and provide additional support for the involvement of the PTBR in the proconvulsant actions of pyrethroids.", 
    "6": "Binding of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist [3H]methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate [( 3H]DMCM) and the agonist [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FNZ) was compared in rat cortical membranes. Halide ions enhanced [3H]DMCM binding three- to fourfold, increasing both the apparent affinity and the number of binding sites for this radioligand. The effect was present at both 0 and 37 degrees C. In contrast, the magnitude of halide stimulation of [3H]FNZ binding was much smaller, resulting solely from an increase in the apparent affinity for this radioligand, and was not observed at 37 degrees C. The potencies but not the efficacies of a series of anions to stimulate both [3H]DMCM and [3H]FNZ binding to benzodiazepine receptors were highly correlated with their relative permeabilities through gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels. Two stress paradigms (10 min of immobilization or ambient-temperature swim stress), previously shown to increase significantly the magnitude of halide-stimulated [3H]FNZ binding, did not significantly affect [3H]DMCM binding. Phospholipase A2 treatment of cortical membrane preparations was equipotent in preventing the stimulatory effect of chloride on both [3H]DMCM and [3H]FNZ binding. These data strongly suggest that anions modify the binding of [3H]DMCM and [3H]FNZ by acting at a common anion binding site that is an integral component of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex.", 
    "7": "Benzodiazepines in the blood samples typical of forensic science work are recovered from 100-250 microliters amounts of blood (diluted with aqueous sodium octyl sulphate to suppress protein binding) onto microcolumns of Porapak-T, and finally eluted into 60-microliters volumes of aqueous acetonitrile. The eluates may be taken directly for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with reductive amperometric detection at a pendent mercury drop electrode held at potentials down to -1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. For high sensitivity work the electrode is preceded by a coulometric detector fitted with porous carbon electrodes held at 0 V (proprietary reference electrode). The technique detects all of the commonly encountered benzodiazepines and others except clobazam, which contains no azomethine group. The detection limits generally are in the range 1-5 ng/ml (40-200 pg HPLC-injected) in hemolyzed human blood, with recovery values of 84-95%, depending on the actual benzodiazepine, over the range examined (less than or equal to 2.14 micrograms/ml). The respective values for the metabolites of nitrazepam are 8-12 ng/ml and 75-84%. The technique is very much less susceptible to the interferences afflicting other commonly applied techniques, and facilitates considerably the analysis of degraded samples.", 
    "8": "The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administrations of the putative follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) suppressing gonadal steroid, 3 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3A4P) on the nociceptive responses of male mice were examined. This allylic steroid elicited significant, dose-dependent (0.001-1.0 micrograms) analgesic responses for 90-150 min after injection. These analgesic effects of 3A4P were stereospecific, the stereoisomer, 3 beta-hydroxy-4-pregnen-20-one (3B4P) failing to affect the nociceptive responses. The analgesic effects of 3A4P were blocked by peripheral administrations of the GABA antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, and reduced by the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788. The exogenous opiate antagonist, naloxone, and the putative endogenous opioid antagonist, Tyr-MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-amide), also reduced 3A4P-induced analgesia, while i.c.v. administration of 3A4P (0.001 and 0.01 micrograms) itself attenuated the analgesic effects arising from peripheral administrations of opiate receptor agonist, morphine. In addition, the calcium channel antagonists, nifedipine and verapamil, enhanced 3A4P-induced analgesia but had no evident effects on the actions of 3B4P. These results suggest that the central analgesic effects of the FSH-suppressing steroid, 3A4P, arise via benzodiazepine--GABA--opiate mechanisms and calcium channels. These findings also suggest possible central modes of action whereby 3A4P may elicit selective suppression of FSH.", 
    "9": "To determine whether midazolam i.m. as premedication for bronchoscopy involves a risk of overall respiratory failure, we compared hydrocodonum (15 mg i.m.) with midazolam (5-7.5 mg i.m., weight related) as premedication in flexible bronchoscopy in two groups of 30 patients. The two groups were comparable. Arterial blood gases were measured before premedication, before bronchoscopy, and 10 and 60 minutes after the procedure. Significant respiratory depression did not occur in either group. Side effects were rare and similar. Confusional states, as reported with midazolam given orally, were not noted. Midazolam administered as reported above is of value as premedication in flexible bronchoscopy.", 
    "10": "The displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding activity by ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE) was studied in both membrane-bound and purified GABAA receptors from adult bovine cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. It was found that the best fit for the displacement of benzodiazepine binding in the cerebellar membranes was a single site with IC50 = 0.55 +/- 0.21 nM, whereas the best fit for cortical and hippocampal membranes was a two-site model with respective values of IC50 = 0.2 +/- 0.09 nM (high affinity), IC50 = 21 +/- 6 nM (low affinity) (cortex) and IC50 = 0.25 +/- 0.05 nM, IC50 = 20 +/- 2 nM (hippocampus). These same properties were retained in the purified GABAA receptor from the three brain regions. Thus, we have demonstrated that binding site heterogeneity as defined by the displacement of beta CCE is preserved in purified GABAA receptors and we suggest that this provides evidence for the existence of GABAA receptor isoforms.", 
    "11": "The ontogenetic development of 'central' and 'peripheral' benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors was investigated in 3 different regions of the guinea pig brain. A marked difference in the developmental profile of these two types of binding sites was observed. The density of central-type receptors gradually increased during embryonic life (especially in cortex and cerebellum), without major changes after birth, while the reverse was true for peripheral-type binding sites. These data contrast with those previously reported in rat, suggesting species differences.", 
    "12": "Flumazenil (Anexate) was used to reverse midazolam sedation in a series of 108 patients undergoing minor diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. At a mode dose of 0.5 mg IV, flumazenil was shown to rapidly and predictably reverse the sedation produced by a mode dose of 5 mg midazolam. Amnesia for the procedure was excellent in all but three cases, and side effects were infrequent and minor. In the endoscopy clinic, the use of flumazenil was perceived by clinicians to significantly improve the speed and quality of recovery.", 
    "13": "Mice pretreated with the benzodiazepine antagonist, CGS 8216 (2.5, 10, or 40 mg/kg, i.p.) learned a T-maze discrimination to a fixed performance criterion more rapidly than vehicle-treated mice. In retention tests conducted one week later, the drug-treated groups had better first-trial recall and greater difficulty reversing the previously trained maze habit when compared with controls, suggesting improved memory for the previously trained maze habit. The enhanced acquisition and retention following CGS 8216 was similar to that observed previously with another benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788). It is postulated that CGS 8216 and flumazenil could act at benzodiazepine receptors to antagonize a tonic inhibitory influence of endogenous, diazepam-like, benzodiazepine receptor ligands on memory processes.", 
    "14": "We examined the effects of several muscarinic agonists and antagonists on phosphoinositide breakdown (PI) and adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibition in rat cerebral cortex and heart, respectively. Acetylcholine, carbachol and methacholine behaved as full agonists in both systems. In contrast, oxotremorine and arecoline failed to stimulate PI turnover but were potent and efficacious at inhibiting AC. Among the antagonists, pirenzepine, dicyclomine, telenzepine and (R)-QNA were both potent (Ki approximately 0.5-7.5 nM) and selective (90- to 8,500-fold) for the PI-linked (putatively M1) brain receptor. In contrast, the cardioselective and ileal-selective M2 antagonists, AF-DX 116 and hexahydrosiladifenidol, were equipotent, competitive inhibitors of both responses. The selectivity of these drugs in terms of their biochemical responses is described.", 
    "15": "We have investigated the involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in depression by quantitating benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites, the ability of GABA to stimulate BZ binding and glutamic acid decarboxylase activity in frontal and temporal cortex obtained at postmortem examination from 21 suicide victims and 21 age- and sex-matched controls. We limited our study to suicide victims with clear evidence of depression, in the absence of symptoms of other psychiatric disorders. Thirteen of the depressed suicide victims had not been prescribed psychoactive drugs recently and none were found in their blood at postmortem; of the remaining 8 suicides, 6 were receiving antidepressant drugs, alone or in combination with other drugs. The number of BZ binding sites was significantly greater (by 18%) in the frontal cortex of the total group of depressed suicides compared to controls, but did not differ in the temporal cortex. The increase in the number of BZ binding sites in the frontal cortex was of similar magnitude when drug-free (16%), drug-treated (21%) and antidepressant-treated suicides (16%) were compared to matched controls, although the increase was only statistically significant for the drug-treated suicides. The Kd of BZ binding and the ability of GABA to stimulate BZ binding did not differ significantly between controls and the total, drug-free, drug-treated or antidepressant-treated suicides in either cortical area. Glutamic acid decarboxylase activity did not differ significantly between control and suicide groups, but was markedly reduced in subjects dying by carbon monoxide poisoning. The present study provides evidence for a greater number of BZ binding sites in the frontal cortex of depressed suicide victims, which could not clearly be attributed to drug treatment.", 
    "16": "Brain membrane preparations of different vertebrates were photoaffinity labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam and subsequently deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F and peptide N-glycopeptidase. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography revealed that each benzodiazepine-binding protein is deglycosylated in two steps, indicating that each protein has two glycosylation sites. Species variation of the apparent molecular masses of the benzodiazepine-binding proteins and regional heterogeneity in avians persist after deglycosylation. These results indicate that the alpha-subunit(s) of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor has undergone electrophoretically detectable changes in its amino acid composition during vertebrate evolution. The existence of at least two different alpha-subunits in avians is further substantiated.", 
    "17": "A mixture of ketamine and diazepam, at doses of 6 mg/kg and 0.30 mg/kg respectively, proved to be a reliable and reasonably safe immobilisation agent for field work on grey and southern elephant seals. It was better than previously reported drugs used either singly or in combination.", 
    "18": "Specific binding sites for benzodiazepines (BZD) have been identified in several nonneuronal tissues including the kidney where they are localized predominantly to the tubular epithelium of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH). The physiological function of these nonneuronal (peripheral) BZD-binding sites is undefined, but it has been suggested that they may represent receptors for putative endogenous ligands that may modulate cell function. In the current study, we examined the in vitro effects of diazepam and Ro5-4864, a specific peripheral BZD-receptor agonist, on the oxygen consumption of medullary TALH tubule suspensions of rabbit kidney. Maximal inhibition of total oxygen consumption was achieved at a dose of 5 X 10(-4) M of either agent. On average, diazepam and Ro5-4864 reduced total oxygen consumption by 41 and 44%, respectively. The predominant inhibition was in the ouabain-sensitive component of oxygen consumption, which suggests that BZDs inhibit active sodium-chloride transport in the TALH. To assess whether this inhibition depends on sodium uptake, TALH tubules were pretreated with amphotericin B (2 X 10(-6) M) to enhance sodium uptake and stimulate basal oxygen consumption; subsequent addition of Ro5-4864 (5 X 10(-4) M) still reduced oxygen consumption to a residual value that was not different from that in TALH tubules treated with Ro5-4864 but without pretreatment with amphotericin B. This suggests that BZD inhibition of transport-related oxygen consumption is not caused by diminution of sodium uptake into cells and thus appears to be distinct from the effect of furosemide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Since the reports elucidating the sequence of four subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptors appeared, it has been clear that pharmacological approaches to the study of subtypes of these receptors are inadequate to selectively detect one subtype in the presence of the others. One methodology that can provide more selective reagents with which to study these subtypes is immunology. Thus, using the information on the primary sequence of these receptors available in the literature, rabbits were injected with an oligopeptide, CRKIPKRPGSVHRTPSRQ, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This oligopeptide (m1 C-terminal peptide) corresponds to the 17-amino acid sequence of the carboxyl terminus of a rat m1 muscarinic receptor. This portion of the amino acid sequence of the muscarinic receptor protein has been shown to be unique to the m1 receptor and has not been found in the other subtypes of the receptor thus far sequenced. The antisera (anti-m1 antisera) had high titer against the m1 C-terminal peptide in a solid phase radioimmunoassay. The anti-m1 antisera were shown to immunoprecipitate [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate ([ 3H]QNB) binding activity solubilized from rat forebrain. [3H]Pirenzepine ([ 3H]PZ) has been shown to interact with a subset of [3H]QNB binding sites in forebrain and heart. The anti-m1 antisera were shown to immunoprecipitate [3H]PZ binding sites in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and corpus striatum, areas believed to be rich in the m1 subtype of the muscarinic receptor. Although [3H]PZ binding activity was present in receptor preparations solubilized from heart, neither [3H]PZ- nor [3H]QNB-binding activities could be immunoprecipitated from this tissue using the anti-m1 antisera. A monoclonal antibody raised against the porcine atrial muscarinic receptor was shown to immunoprecipitate both [3H]PZ- and [3H]QNB-binding activities solubilized from rat heart, but only [3H]QNB-binding activity could be immunoprecipitated from forebrain using this antibody. Immunoprecipitation of [3H]PZ- and [3H]QNB-binding activity by anti-m1 antisera could be inhibited by the m1 C-terminal peptide. Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal portions of the rat m3 and m4 muscarinic receptor were not inhibitory in the immunoprecipitation assay. This study provides further evidence for subtypes of muscarinic receptors in rat tissues and supports the hypothesis that receptor subtypes defined using PZ can be further subclassified on the basis of differences in primary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The abuse liability of alprazolam was studied in 17 abstinent alcoholic and 12 control subjects. A single 1-mg oral dose of alprazolam was administered, and subjective effects were measured by scales modified from the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI). Multiple blood samples for alprazolam measurement were drawn over 48 hours. No statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were found between groups. Alcoholics had lower baseline scores on the ARCI-Morphine/Benzedrine Group Scale (euphoria) and had greater drug-induced changes than nonalcoholics. The findings suggest that alcoholics may be at high risk to abuse alprazolam because it has a positive mood effect not seen in nonalcoholics.", 
    "21": "Simultaneous monitoring of carbamazepine and its metabolities is helpful in providing information on the induction process via the epoxide-diol route. The present method involves the liquid-chromatographic analysis of 1.0 mL of plasma for carbamazepine at concentrations of 0.025 to 4.0 mg/L and for both the 10,11-epoxide and 10,11-transdiol metabolites at concentrations of 0.01 to 1.0 mg/L. Weighted regression equations, expressing peak area ratios as a function of concentrations of carbamazepine and its epoxide and transdiol metabolites in the standards, were used to determine concentrations in plasma samples.", 
    "22": "Sublingual lorazepam was successful in controlling serial seizures in ten children. There was both intrasubject and intersubject variability in the effective dose, which ranged from about 0.05 mg/kg to 0.15 mg/kg. Side effects were minimal and consisted of drowsiness, unsteadiness, nausea, and hyperactivity. Sublingual lorazepam is an easy and effective way to treat serial seizures at home.", 
    "23": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous 10-kDa polypeptide was isolated from rat and human brain by monitoring displacement of radioactive diazepam bound to specific recognition sites in brain synaptic and mitochondrial membranes. The cellular location of DBI mRNA was studied in rat brain and selected peripheral tissues by in situ hybridization histochemistry with a 35S-labeled single-stranded complementary RNA probe. DBI mRNA was heterogeneously distributed in rat brain, with particularly high levels in the area postrema, the cerebellar cortex, and ependyma of the third ventricle. Intermediate levels were found in the olfactory bulb, pontine nuclei, inferior colliculi, arcuate nucleus, and pineal gland. Relatively low but significant levels of silver grains were observed overlying many mesencephalic and telencephalic areas that have previously been shown to contain numerous DBI-immunoreactive neurons and a high density of central benzodiazepine receptors. In situ hybridizations also revealed high levels of DBI mRNA in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, liver, and germinal center of the white pulp of spleen, all tissues that are rich in peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. The tissue-specific pattern of DBI gene expression described here could be exploited to further understand the physiological function of DBI in the brain and periphery.", 
    "24": "We have used in situ chromosome hybridization and human-mouse somatic cell hybrids to map the gene(s) for human diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous putative modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor acting at the allosteric regulatory center of this receptor that includes the benzodiazepine recognition site. In 784 chromosome spreads hybridized with human DBI cDNA, the distribution of 1476 labeled sites revealed a significant clustering of autoradiographic grains (11.3% of total label) on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q). Furthermore, 63.5% of the grains found on 2q were located on 2q12-21, suggesting regional mapping of DBI gene(s) to this segment. Secondary hybridization signals were frequently observed on other chromosomes and they were statistically significant mainly for chromosomes 5, 6, 11, and 14. In addition, DNA from 32 human-mouse cell hybrids was digested with BamHI and probed with human DBI cDNA. A 3.5-kilobase band, which probably represents the human DBI gene, was assigned to chromosome 2. Four higher molecular weight bands, also detected in BamHI digests, could not be unequivocally assigned. A chromosome 2 location was excluded for the 27-, 13-, and 10-kilobase bands. These results assign a human DBI gene to chromosome 2 (2q12-21) and indicate that three of the four homologous sequences detected by the human DBI probe are located on three other chromosomes.", 
    "25": "In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 58 patients with postherpetic neuralgia received 6-week courses of amitriptyline, 12.5 to 150 mg/d; lorazepam, 0.5 to 6 mg/d; or lactose placebo. Doses were titrated to the maximum level tolerated. Patients rated pain in a diary, using lists of verbal descriptors. Forty-seven percent of patients reported moderate or greater relief with amitriptyline, 16% with placebo, and 15% with lorazepam. Mean amitriptyline dose was 65 mg/d. Greater relief was associated with higher amitriptyline doses, up to the maximum dose of 150 mg/d, and with higher serum tricyclic levels. Lorazepam did not relieve pain and was associated with severe depressive reactions in four patients.", 
    "26": "Antral biopsy specimens from 89 consecutive patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and erosive prepyloric changes included in a prospective, randomized, double-blind 4-wk study of the effect of an aluminum-magnesium antacid (120 mmol/day) or pirenzepine (50 mg b.i.d.) vs. placebo were examined histologically. Campylobacter pylori (CP) was found by light microscopy of silver-stained sections in 25 patients (28%). Campylobacter pylori-positive patients were on average older than CP-negative patients (p = 0.02). There was a strong association between CP colonization and acute inflammation (p less than 0.001), both being rare in the absence of chronic inflammation. During treatment with antacids, the density of CP decreased (p less than 0.001) without any improvement of the inflammatory reaction. On the contrary, the number of patients with gastritis tended to increase after antacids as compared with placebo (p less than 0.10). A separate analysis showed no symptomatic effect of the drugs. Thus, neither nonulcer dyspepsia nor erosive prepyloric changes are strongly associated with antral CP colonization or acute inflammation. Aluminum-magnesium antacids may suppress antral CP infection without healing the gastritis or relieving symptoms.",

The acetyl derivative (2) of ester 1 in preliminary pharmacological screening showed analgesic activity in the \"writhing\" test and the benzoyl derivative (5) exhibited antianxiety properties in the four plate test, while N,N-disubstituted aminoacetyl derivatives of 1 showed analgesic and anticonvulsant activity (10).",

Suppression of GH secretion was observed in all children for 2-3 h after drug administration but was followed by rebound secretion of GH after 4-6 h. Consequently there was little overall change in GH secretion. In the dose regimen used the disruption of normal pulsatile GH secretion was not sufficiently significant to change final or predicted heights.", 
    "29": "The need for optimal nocturnal performance continues to increase in our society. Nighttime function is dependent upon the ability to sleep effectively during the day. The current study examined daytime sleep after placebo, 0.125 mg (364 nmol), 0.25 mg (729 nmol), or 0.50 mg (1458 nmol) of triazolam, and nocturnal performance in the work shift that followed. Forty-one normal young adult subjects participated in a repeated-measures design in which each subject received each medication dose level in a separate week. The results indicated that day sleep increased as a linear function of drug dose from 234 to 374 minutes. Nocturnal alertness, as measured by subjective report and objective nap latency test, increased significantly following the use of triazolam, 0.25 and 0.50 mg, for the day sleep period. Nocturnal performance, as measured by auditory vigilance and additions, also increased significantly following the use of triazolam. Marginal evidence for medication hangover was found at the 0.50-mg dose, and it was therefore recommended that the use of the 0.50-mg dose be monitored carefully if performance demand were to follow medication use by less than 12 hours. The results for the study were interpreted as indicating that under certain conditions, triazolam could effectively increase daytime sleep and improve alertness and performance in the following nocturnal work period.", 
    "30": "Using clonidine, naltrexone, and diazepam, 60 withdrawals from heroin and other opioids involving 56 addicts were carried out with only one patient dropping out. In the last 23 cases, we used a modification of the standard technique, giving significantly higher doses of naltrexone and clonidine on the first day. This significantly reduced the average withdrawal time from 3.30 days to 2.32 days, despite lower clonidine dosage and significantly lower diazepam dosage on the second day. The speed, effectiveness, economy, and high acceptability of this withdrawal technique have implications for both private and state-funded treatment programmes.", 
    "31": "The relative efficacy and safety of drugs and combinations used clinically in dentistry as premedicants to alleviate patient apprehension are largely unsubstantiated. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of agents used for parenteral sedation through controlled clinical trials, it is first necessary to identify which drugs, doses, and routes of administration are actually used in practice. A survey instrument was developed to characterize the drugs used clinically for anesthesia and sedation by dentists with advanced training in pain control. A random sample of 500 dentists who frequently use anesthesia and sedation in practice was selected from the Fellows of the American Dental Society of Anesthesiology. The first mailing was followed by a second mailing to nonrespondents after 30 days. The respondents report a variety of parenteral sedation techniques in combination with local anesthesia (the response categories are not mutually exclusive): nitrous oxide (64%), intravenous conscious sedation (59%), intravenous \"deep\" sedation (47%), and outpatient general anesthesia (27%). Drugs most commonly reported for intravenous sedation include diazepam, methohexital, midazolam, and combinations of these drugs with narcotics. A total of 82 distinct drugs and combinations was reported for intravenous sedation and anesthesia. Oral premedication and intramuscular sedation are rarely used by this group. Most general anesthesia reported is done on an outpatient basis in private practice. These results indicate that a wide variety of drugs is employed for parenteral sedation in dental practice, but the most common practice among dentists with advanced training in anesthesia is local anesthesia supplemented with intravenous sedation consisting of a benzodiazepine and an opioid or a barbiturate.", 
    "32": "A rabbit tooth pulp antinociceptive model was used to investigate the effect of prior administration of diazepam or muscimol on the potency and duration of fentanyl and meperidine Potency experiments compared ED(50) values in all-or-none dose-response assays between both muscimol (0.25 mg/kg) and saline, and diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) and propylene glycol vehicle. An all-or-none effect was defined as doubling of voltage threshold to elicit a lick/chew evoked response. Duration experiments compared time (minutes) to 50% maximum possible effect (MPE) of an ED(90) dose of fentanyl (0.04 mg/kg) and to 50% and 20% MPE of an ED(98) dose of meperidine (17 mg/kg) 10 minutes after pretreatment with diazepam (1.5 mg/kg). Prior (10 minutes) injection of diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) increased the ED(50) value for meperidine (3.06 mg/kg) compared with its control (1.48 mg/kg), indicating a decrease in antinociceptive potency. The same dose of diazepam decreased the ED(50) value for fentanyl (1.1 \u03bcg/kg) compared with its control (13.1 \u03bcg/kg), indicating an increase in antinociceptive potency. Muscimol also had a similar effect on fentanyl (ED(50), 1.8 \u03bcg/kg) compared with saline control (ED(50), 13.8 \u03bcg/kg). Diazepam, vehicle, and muscimol by themselves had no effect on voltage thresholds to elicit a lick/chew response. Time to 50% MPE for diazepam-fentanyl was 38 minutes vs. 25 minutes for vehicle-fetanyl; time to 20% MPE for diazepam-meperidine was 38 minutes vs. 54 minutes for vehicle-meperidine (maximum percentage of MPE produced by diazepam-meperidine was 40% compared with 100% MPE for vehicle-meperidine). Percentages of MPE for diazepam-meperidine were significantly lower than those for vehicle-meperidine at all time intervals, whereas percentages of MPE for diazepam-fentanyl were significantly greater than those for vehicle-fentanyl over time.", 
    "33": "The effects of various sedatives on air cystometry in dogs were investigated. Oxymorphone plus acepromazine, xylazine alone, atropine plus xylazine, and diazepam plus ketamine were compared for interference with the detrusor reflex, adequacy of patient restraint, and development of adverse side effects. Atropine plus xylazine was the best of the 4 drug combinations tested, because it had the least interference with the detrusor reflex, bradycardia did not develop, and excellent restraint was obtained. Pain and hematuria were common whenever intravesicular pressure exceeded 40 cm of H2O, yet pressures that high were rarely necessary to stimulate the detrusor reflex.", 
    "34": "During one week in 1985, 227 general practitioners (GPs) in the county of Aarhus, Denmark, recorded all their prescriptions of psychotropic drugs, amounting to 4,180 prescriptions for 3756 patients. There was great variation in the rate of prescribing among the GPs. The median number of prescribed defined daily doses per 1,000 registered patients per day was 84, and the corresponding median number of prescriptions per 1,000 patients per week was 14. There was a significantly lower rate of prescribing of psychotropic drugs by rural/small town GPs, compared with GPs in major cities (odds ratio, 0.84; 99% confidence limits, 0.77-0.91), after correction for differences in patients' age and sex. There were no differences in rate of prescribing among GPs in relation to size and type of practice, nor to the age and sex of the GP.", 
    "35": "Muscarinic receptor binding was examined in bovine adrenal medullary microsomes following exposure to tetranitromethane (TNM) that modifies tyrosine and cysteine residues in proteins. The TNM (10-100 microM) treatment of adrenal medullary microsomes caused a concentration-dependent and irreversible reduction in the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for l-(3H)quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), with a slight increase in the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). Typically, about a 36% decrease and a 1.3-fold increase in the corresponding values were obtained at 50 microM of TNM. The alteration in the Bmax was partially prevented by atropine but not carbamylcholine, and it was not reversed by subsequent treatment with dithiothreitol, a disulfide reducing agent. The change in the KD was unaffected by these agents. The TNM (50 microM) treatment also caused a slight decrease in the affinity of atropine and pirenzepine (for both the high and low affinity sites), and it caused a slight decrease in the affinity of carbamylcholine at the high affinity site, with a large loss of the low affinity site. Thus, the results indicate that TNM causes a loss of muscarinic binding sites and a decrease in the binding affinity of muscarinic receptors in bovine adrenal medulla, probably through modifications of functional groups such as tyrosine residues.", 
    "36": "Effects of diazepam (DZP), a synthetic benzodiazepine drug, and anthramycin (ATM), a benzodiazepine antitumor antibiotic produced by a certain species of streptomyces, on the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[14C]-glucose (2-DG) in mouse brain neurons with or without cholecystokinin were examined. 2-DG uptake in neurons was evaluated by using an autoradiographic technique. The sulfated octapeptide CCK (CCK8) was injected intracisternally; DZP and ATM, intraperitoneally; and 2-DG, intravenously to mice. Autoradiograms prepared from the slices of the brain were converted to false color images. CCK8 (1 microgram/mouse) markedly stimulated the 2-DG uptake in neurons in the various regions of the brain, but the stimulative effects of CCK8 was almost completely suppressed after an intraperitoneal administration of 1.0 mg/kg of DZP or 0.5 mg/kg of ATM. Since it has been previously shown that these doses of DZP and ATM almost completely reversed the antinociception produced by 1 microgram/mouse of CCK8, the present results on the 2-DG uptake in the mouse brain are considered to further support the antagonism between CCK8 and DZP or ATM in the central nervous system.", 
    "37": "A mild form of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a schizophrenic patient who was receiving a depot neuroleptic is described and beneficial response to oral diazepam 50 mg daily is reported.", 
    "38": "A rapid method for isolation of various benzodiazepines from human samples with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges before wide-bore capillary gas chromatography is described. The drugs dissolved in alkaline samples were directly applied to the cartridges and eluted with hexane/isopropanol (9:1). The recoveries were excellent for all drugs in urine samples, but were somewhat lower for some drugs in plasma samples. The latter problem could be easily circumvented by using a deproteinization process before their application to the cartridge. We can recommend the Sep-Pak C18 cartridges for isolation of benzodiazepines because of their simplicity and rapidity.", 
    "39": "A cysticercus of a possibly undescribed species of Taenia which occurs commonly in Taiwan aborigines was used to establish an experimental infection in a human volunteer. Symptomatic effects attributed to the infection included diarrhoea, upper abdominal pain, and increase or loss of appetite over a four-month period. After an expelled proglottid was observed 122 days post-exposure, eggs and proglottids were found continuously until the patient was treated with anthelmintics. Antibody titres measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and levels of eosinophilia seemed to correlate with symptoms. Haematological analyses revealed an abnormal lipid metabolism during the entire symptomatic period.", 
    "40": "A rapid and efficient procedure is described for the extraction and analysis of oxazepam, the major urinary metabolite of diazepam in greyhounds. Urine was extracted by passing through a bonded silica column (Bond Elut) following enzyme hydrolysis. The adsorbed drug was eluted and then detected and measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Recoveries were in excess of 85% at 50 ng/ml concentrations. Detection was possible up to 30 h after a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg).", 
    "41": "Midazolam was used as an intramuscular premedication combined with atropine in a population of 100 patients receiving loco-regional anaesthesia for urologic procedures. Two different dosages were given according to age: 0.10 mg/kg for patients over 50 years, 0.15 mg/kg for those under 50. This premedication was always effected just before the patient's transport to surgery. We observe the quality of anxiety relief (85%), sedation (82%), anterograde amnesia. These results confirm that midazolam is a suitable drug for late premedication by the intramuscular route. It is a potent drug with regular short-lasting action, which lead us to suggest its use in ambulatory anaesthesia.", 
    "42": "Midazolam was studied as an IV sedative agent in 30 women aged of 75 years or more, undergoing hip surgery or Ender nailing, who received a spinal anaesthesia with 15 mg of plain bupivacaine. A mean dose of midazolam 0.077 mg.kg-1 was required to induce adequate sedation which was maintained by repeated doses of 2.5 mg. Post-operatively, no somnolence was noted at 2 hr. A marked amnesic effect was observed in 77% of cases. No clinically adverse cardiovascular or respiratory effects were encountered. It is concluded that midazolam is a useful sedative agent for spinal anaesthesia of short duration in the elderly.", 
    "43": "Midazolam 0.3 mg kg-1 was given as a single dose to three groups of children undergoing cardiac surgery to determine its pharmacokinetic profile in this situation. The first group, undergoing closed heart surgery, received the midazolam during the operation. The other groups underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with and without complete circulatory arrest. Mean clearance was 512 ml kg-1 h-1 and mean elimination half-lives were 3.3 h following CPB, with a tendency to a higher clearance in those children who had not undergone bypass. In a subsequent part of the study, 10 children received an infusion of midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 h-1, in combination with intermittent doses of morphine, in the postoperative period. Mean plasma midazolam concentrations consistent with adequate sedation were 80-100 ng ml-1 during the infusion. One child who had not undergone CPB had very low plasma concentrations of midazolam with the same rate of infusion, consistent with the tendency for higher clearance in this group in the bolus pharmacokinetic study.", 
    "44": "Urine lipoperoxides were measured, as the malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid adduct, by \"high performance\" liquid chromatography in men who tested positive for any of the common \"drugs of abuse.\" Urine malondialdehyde concentrations were within the reference range in those urines containing barbiturates and amphetamines. On the other hand, significant urine malondialdehyde elevations were associated with those testing positive for marijuana (p less than 0.005), cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, and in those urines containing multiple drugs (p less than 0.001). The mechanism of tissue damage by these drugs is not necessarily by lipid peroxidation, since their primary toxic effects might result in cellular injury by an alternative mechanism; the observed increased lipid peroxidation could be a secondary phenomenon following tissue injury.", 
    "45": "A randomized cross-over study was done to determine if significant oxygen desaturation occurs during third molar surgery under conscious sedation with midazolam to warrant supplementary oxygen. Thirty-two healthy patients of either sex, between the ages of 18 and 40 years, had bilateral symmetrically impacted lower third molar surgery under local anesthesia in two visits. Randomly at one visit the local anesthesia was supplemented with midazolam sedation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and pulse were carried out. At the rate of injection with the dose of midazolam used, no significant desaturation attributable to midazolam sedation was observed. However, short periods of significant desaturation occurred with both procedures. These episodes, though of no consequence to healthy people, may produce problems in compromised patients, and indicate the importance of monitoring of oxygen saturation in all patients during minor oral surgery procedures.",

    "47": "Alfentanil, a short-acting opioid, was used as an adjuvant to midazolam for sedation of 30 outpatients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The operating conditions and recovery times were compared with those of a similar group of 30 patients sedated with midazolam only. The use of alfentanil resulted in improved operating conditions and a more rapid recovery. Patient acceptance was high.", 
    "48": "Nasopharyngeal recording of evoked potentials is only seldom used, and a systematic description of subcortical SEP derivations using this method is essentially lacking. In twelve patients, sedated after neurosurgical operations and without signs of brainstem or cervical spinal cord dysfunction, subcortical SEP were recorded from nasopharynx (Pgz) and neck after stimulation of median and tibial nerves. Generally, a midfrontal reference (Fz) was used; in four cases, evoked potentials were additionally recorded against a non-cephalic reference. The main feature in Pgz-Fz recordings was a negative wave corresponding to the N13 (N30) component in neck derivations after stimulation of median (tibial) nerve. This wave is interpreted as reflection of medial lemniscal activity; so Pgz-Fz derivations make possible the isolated recording of the subcomponent N13b (medial lemniscus, or cuneate nucleus), without overlap with N13a (dorsal horn) - as do neck-to-scalp recordings-; and without the considerable artifacts known from farfield recordings. This interpretation is confirmed by SEP recordings in a brain death patient, showing a clear N13 component in neck-to-scalp derivations while lacking any negative wave at Pgz-Fz. In Pgz recordings against a non-cephalic reference, the P9 and P11 components (corresponding to the well known scalp farfield potentials) were clearly seen, whereas the P14 component was of low amplitude in three cases and lacking at all in one case. In conclusion, nasopharyngeal electrodes provide a useful tool in subcortical SEP recording; due to their position medio-ventrally to the lower brainstem, they complete standard electrode montages giving further informations about generator dipole location.", 
    "49": "To evaluate the effects of chronic midazolam (8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H- imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine) administration on discriminative motor control, rats were trained to hold a force transducer operated with a paw so that it remained between upper and lower limits of a force band for a continuous 1.5-sec period to deliver each food pellet. Acute doses of midazolam (0.75-3.0 mg/kg s.c.) impaired indices of motor performance as well as session work rate, a measure of sedation. Separate groups received chronic midazolam injections either pressession (Before Group) or postsession (After Group), or presession vehicle (Vehicle Group). The After and Vehicle Groups indicated that neither chronic postsession midazolam, its withdrawal, nor time alone, changed motor performance. The Before Group was affected, and although complete tolerance to work-rate decrements developed rapidly to chronic dosing (3.0 mg/kg), tolerance to motor impairment was incomplete even after 4 months. Presession drug probes with midazolam to the After Group revealed that, although tolerance to work-rate decrement had developed, no tolerance had developed with respect to the capacity for midazolam to impair motor performance. During the chronic phase of midazolam injection to the Before Group, sessions that omitted midazolam, or antagonized it with Ro 15-1788, led to improved motor performance (a drug-purge effect). Precipitated withdrawal was not produced by Ro 15-1788, although simple drug withdrawal did disrupt Before Group motor performance after 4 months of chronic dosing. Ensuing sessions showed a marked improvement in motor performance which returned to the original, prechronic, base-line level.", 
    "50": "Thirty-nine healthy volunteers received single oral doses of either alprazolam (1 mg), lorazepam (2 mg), prazepam (20 mg), or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study. Plasma drug concentrations, subjective self-ratings, and the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) were evaluated during 24 hours after dosage. Alprazolam was absorbed rapidly and produced correspondingly rapid sedation and impaired DSST performance. These effects also resolved rapidly, being similar to placebo by 4 to 6 hours after dosage. Sedative and DSST-impairing effects of lorazepam were of slower onset but longer duration than those of alprazolam. After oral prazepam, appearance of desmethyldiazepam in plasma was slow, with minimal sedative and DSST-impairing effects. Twenty-four hours after dosage, both alprazolam and lorazepam significantly impaired recall of a list of 16 words learned previously 3 hours after dosage. Thus benzodiazepines with approximately equivalent clinical anxiolytic properties may have different sedative, performance-impairing, and amnesic profiles after single doses in healthy volunteers; these differences are explained at least in part by pharmacokinetic variations.", 
    "51": "Chronic increases in blood flow caused by an arteriovenous fistula augment endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine. To determine whether endothelial muscarinic receptors are altered, concentration-response curves to acetylcholine were obtained in the presence of pirenzepine in fistula- and sham-operated canine femoral arteries. Pirenzepine inhibited the response to acetylcholine in both arteries. The pA2 (log Kb) for the antagonist was the same. A bioassay system was used to assess release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Rings of femoral artery (without endothelium) from unoperated dogs relaxed more when superfused with perfusate derived from endothelium of fistula-operated arteries during acetylcholine stimulation. Rings without endothelium of sham- and fistula-operated arteries relaxed to the same extent when superfused with perfusate derived from the endothelium of unoperated femoral arteries. These results suggest that augmented relaxations to acetylcholine in canine arteries where blood flow is chronically elevated do not result from changes in the subtype of endothelial muscarinic receptors or in the sensitivity of the underlying smooth muscle to endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). They are likely due to increased release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) on muscarinic activation.", 
    "52": "Because of the unreliability of the alcoholic, these suggestions are only intended for inpatients. Effective agents are presented first, and then the often very different pharmacological concepts are critically reviewed. Physicians use target symptoms as checkpoints for the effective pharmacological treatment of the alcohol-withdrawal syndrome. Clomethiazole and benzodiazepines are regarded as proven monotherapeutics against delirium. However, their somatic side effects and above all the problems of drug dependence make it necessary to look for a lower-risk medication. In every case, physicians must look more closely into the possibility of treating the individual alcohol-withdrawal syndrome with an agent less liable to cause addiction. Attractive, adequately tested alternatives are now becoming available for the large number of withdrawal syndromes which are below the level of delirium in terms of severity. This paper discusses the significance of substances without dependence potential, e.g. carbamazepine. This aspect is of special interest for the psychiatrist, whose task it is to guarantee the patient's abstinence after detoxification. We also look at other possible advantages of these substances when given in combination with drugs of the alcohol-barbiturate group against severe alcohol-withdrawal syndromes. Following a discussion of priority questions for further research, we draw attention to methodological deficiencies in earlier evaluation studies, and make suggestions for improved designs of drug trials.", 
    "53": "In a randomized crossover study, twelve patients presenting a generalized anxiety disorder received either a 1 mg oral tablet or a 1 mg sublingual tablet of lorazepam three times daily for 7 days. After a 7-day washout period, each patient received a 7-day treatment with the other tablet form. Treatments were administered in a double-blind manner using placebos of both the oral and sublingual tablets. Psychiatric evaluations were carried out before and following each of the three periods. Blood samples were drawn at intervals for 48 h following the last dose of each treatment. The plasma concentrations of lorazepam were measured by gas chromatography using an electron-capture detector. Both the oral and sublingual lorazepam produced a significant anxiolytic effect; there was no statistically significant difference between the therapeutic effectiveness of the two forms of lorazepam. The main pharmacokinetic parameters for the oral and sublingual tablets were, respectively: elimination half-life 15.6h and 11.7h; maximal concentration 40.8 ng ml-1 and 42.2 ng ml-1; time to reach maximal concentration 1.2h and 1.4h; corrected area under the curve 310.6 ng hml-1 and 313.6 ng hml-1. There was no statistically significant difference between the oral and sublingual tablets for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters measured.", 
    "54": "Harmful psychological and physical consequences may result when elderly people fall. I summarize the epidemiology of falls among elderly people and focus on three potentially remediable causes of falls: reduced peripheral neurosensation, the use of psychoactive medication, and environmental hazards. From 1960 to 1980, death rates from falls among white persons 75 years of age and older have decreased by more than 50%. Fall rates among community-dwelling elderly people increase with age and are greater for women than men. The death rates from falls, however, are now greater for men than women. Reduced peripheral neurosensation in the lower extremities may be a significant cause of falls among the elderly. Recreational walking or physical therapy may improve these deficits and lead to fewer falls. The use of psychoactive medications, most commonly benzodiazepine sedatives, is possibly associated with an increased risk of falls and hip fractures; greater caution in the use of these medications is warranted. The elimination or redesign of steps and curbs and the provision of hand railings and walking aids may be the most effective environmental approaches to preventing falls. These conclusions need further study in community-dwelling elderly populations.", 
    "55": "Sedation is routinely used in pediatric patients undergoing diagnostic procedures. Meperidine with promethazine and chlorpromazine; meperidine with pentobarbital; and meperidine, morphine, pentobarbital, thiopental, methohexital, chloral hydrate, and benzodiazepines as single agents have been used at different doses in patients for various procedures including computed tomography, endoscopy, electroencephalography, and bone marrow biopsies. Most available studies, however, have not compared these drugs in a controlled and blind manner, and the data have often been collected retrospectively. In addition, the degree and duration of sedation required may depend on the procedure. Thus, it is difficult to recommend the drug of choice for producing sedation. Serious cardiac and respiratory effects and excessive sedation have been associated with these drugs, even when normal doses were used. Controlled studies and specific guidelines are needed for optimal use and monitoring of these drugs in pediatric patients.", 
    "56": "Twenty-seven outpatients who had primary nonagitated depression that had been treated for 3.5 months with imipramine were included in the study. Of these, 14 patients were given additional diazepam treatment (10 mg/day) and 13 patients got placebo. The additional medication was stopped, and withdrawal reactions were observed after two weeks. The depression scores (both global evaluation and CPRS) increased significantly in the diazepam group, without any changes in the placebo group. Eleven patients in the diazepam group and four in the placebo group reported their condition as impaired after discontinuing their additional medication. Four patients in the placebo group and none in the diazepam group reported improvement. The level of working activity decreased significantly in the diazepam group and increased in the placebo group. The serum level of imipramine decreased in the placebo group (P = 0.07), but not in the diazepam group. Serum levels of desipramine decreased significantly in both groups (P less than 0.05). Our study indicates that the discontinuation of diazepam, even when given in moderate dosage over a relatively short period of time, may cause withdrawal reactions in combined antidepressant/diazepam treatment. This may be caused by a possible tendency for the depression to become chronic. Such chronicity may be the reason for secondary dependency to diazepam.", 
    "57": "The effect of a single dose of diazepam on sleep and respiration was studied in nine patients with chronic airflow obstruction with moderate arterial hypoxaemia but no hypercapnia. Diazepam improved sleep duration without exacerbating nocturnal hypoxaemia and there was no change in the number of apnoeic events after a single 5 mg dose at night.", 
    "58": "The antimuscarinic effects of methoctramine (N, N'-bis[6-[(2-methoxybenzyl)amino]hexyl]-1, 8-octanediamine tetrahydrochloride), a polymethylene tetraamine endowed with high cardioselectivity in vitro, were assessed in two in vivo preparations. Methoctramine (300 micrograms/kg i.v.) strongly inhibited the methacholine- and muscarine-induced bradycardia in the anaesthetized an pithed rat, respectively. The same dose of methoctramine did not significantly affect the depressor action of methacholine in the anaesthetized rat mediated by vascular M2 receptors. Furthermore, even high doses of methoctramine (up to 1 mg/kg i.v.) did not reduce the ganglionic M1 receptor-mediated tachycardia and pressor response to muscarine or McN-A-343 in the pithed rat. These data suggest that methoctramine while showing high affinity for cardiac M2 alpha receptors has rather low affinity for ganglionic M1 and vascular M2 receptors. This in vivo study thus provides further evidence to support the view that methoctramine is a potent and highly selective antagonist of cardiac M2 alpha receptors.", 
    "59": "We reviewed the treatment outcomes of 81 patients with multifocal tic disorders followed in our movement disorders clinic. From the three drugs used, rank orders of effectiveness were haloperidol, clonazepam, and clonidine. Because of the risk of tardive dyskinesia, we suggest first a trial with clonazepam, later combined with clonidine if clonazepam alone is not effective. Haloperidol should be reserved for the most disabling cases, and given only after trials with both clonazepam and clonidine have failed.", 
    "60": "(-)-Cocaine inhibits M2 muscarinic cholinergic binding measured with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in heart and brain with a Ki of 18.8 microM. The cyclic nucleotide 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate does not shift the competition curve, suggesting that (-)-cocaine is an antagonist. (-)-Cocaine also reverses the methacholine-induced inhibition of guinea pig atrial contractions at a similar concentration. Although (+)-cocaine is about 8-fold more potent than (-)-cocaine, (+)-cocaine is not present in extracts of the coca plant. Of the many compounds tested, only (-)-cocaine and lidocaine have a higher affinity at M2 muscarinic receptors than at M1 receptors; other compounds such as (+)-cocaine, norcocaine, procaine and dimethocaine are equipotent at the M1 and M2 subtypes. These results indicate that cocaine can act as an antimuscarinic agent, particularly at higher, toxic doses.", 
    "61": "This double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated rebound anxiety during and after 5 weeks of nightly use of triazolam 0.5 mg, a short half-life, rapidly absorbed benzodiazepine hypnotic. The study subjects were chronic insomniacs with moderate levels of psychopathology and prior use of hypnotics. Anxiety was assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS), instead of the anxiety scales more typically used in psychopharmacology: the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and a visual analogue scale. The POMS test was administered twice a day during the study. The results indicated that triazolam was not associated with increased anxiety the morning or the evening after previous-night drug administration. The results are discussed in view of the methodological issues in assessing anxiety in prior studies.", 
    "62": "Of 43 patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks who took placebo for 8 weeks in two double-blind studies, one in four markedly improved. Those with consistently normal dexamethasone suppression test results were significantly more likely to show a placebo response as were those with lower anxiety ratings at the outset of treatment.", 
    "63": "The DNA alkylation and sequence specificity of a group of natural and synthetic pyrrolo-[1,4]benzodiazepines [P(1,4)Bs] were evaluated by using an exonuclease III stop assay, and the results were compared with in vitro and in vivo biological potency and antitumor activity. The P(1,4)B antibiotics are potent antitumor agents produced by various Actinomycetes, which are believed to mediate their cytotoxic effects by covalent bonding through N-2 of guanine in the minor groove of DNA. In this article we describe the results of a sensitive DNA alkylation assay using exonuclease III which permits both estimation of the extent of DNA modification as well as location of the precise guanines to which the drugs are covalently bound. Using this assay, we have evaluated a series of natural and synthetic compounds of the P(1,4)B class for their ability to bind to DNA and also determined their DNA sequence preference. The compounds included in this study are P(1,4)Bs carrying different substituents in the aromatic ring, having varying degrees of saturation in the five-membered ring, or differing in the stereochemistry at C-11a. These same compounds were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity against B16 melanoma cells, for potency in vivo in B6D2F1 mice (LD50), and for antitumor activity (ILSmax) against P388 leukemia cells. A good correlation was found between extent of DNA alkylation and in vitro and in vivo potency. Furthermore, on the basis of electronic and steric considerations, it was possible to rationalize why those compounds that showed negligible biological activity were unable to bond covalently to DNA. Last, we have determined that the degree of saturation in the five-membered ring of the P(1,4)Bs has a significant effect on the DNA bonding reactivity and biological activity of this class of compounds.", 
    "64": "In linear pharmacokinetics, the time course of the plasma concentration of a drug, Ct, is expressed by the sum of exponential terms, (formula; see text) This article proposes a new statistical criterion for discriminating between alternate polyexponential models. According to this new criterion, the model that best interprets a set of experimental data points is that which minimizes the area between the approximate confidence limits of Ct.", 
    "65": "Since the administration of both diazepam and midazolam are claimed to cause adverse haemodynamic effects following fentanyl or sufentanil intravenous injection, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the reverse sequence, (midazolam-sufentanil) on haemodynamic variables, adequacy of analgesia, amnesia and recovery in 15 adult patients undergoing coronary artery surgery (with a mean +/- SEM ejection fraction of 0.41 +/- 0.03). After routine premedication, midazolam 0.14 +/- 0.01 mg.kg-1 IV was given over one min followed 5 min later by sufentanil in incremental IV doses of 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 to a total pre-intubation dose of 4.0-5.0 micrograms.kg-1 injected in 10 min. One minute after the initial dose of sufentanil, pancuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 IV was given in 30 seconds. The incremental doses of sufentanil were based on a greater than 15 per cent increase in rate-pressure product. The mean dose of sufentanil before cardiopulmonary bypass was 9.6 +/- 2.1 micrograms.kg-1 and 13.9 +/- 1.3 micrograms.kg-1 for the entire procedure. A significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures occurred after midazolam administration which was sustained until sternotomy. A significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance occurred following midazolam. Sufentanil reduced the left ventricular stroke-work index. Tracheal intubation, skin incision and sternotomy elicited no adverse haemodynamic responses. Adequate analgesia, complete amnesia and early recovery of wakefulness were observed."
