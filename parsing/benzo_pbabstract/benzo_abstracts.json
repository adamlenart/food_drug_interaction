    "2": "A woman with treatment resistant depression received a course of ECT while taking flurazepam and pregabalin, but seizures were of short duration and symptomatic improvement was minimal. After discontinuation of flurazepam and pregabalin, a course of right unilateral ultrabrief ECT was associated with adequate seizures and remission of depression and suicidal ideation. Our literature review suggests that benzodiazepines decrease seizure duration, but most evidence shows no association with increased seizure threshold. One prospective RCT and 3 large retrospective studies found that benzodiazepines compromise the efficacy of unilateral but not bilateral ECT. Regarding anticonvulsants, several studies had varied and contradictory results on their effect on seizure duration and seizure threshold. Of the 2 large retrospective studies and 3 RCTs, only 1 retrospective study showed that anticonvulsants decrease the efficacy of ECT.", 
    "3": "Judicious assessment of all medications used in combination with ECT is recommended. Overall, published studies suggest that benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants impact the clinical outcomes of ECT less than what would be expected given their pharmacologic effects. However, there are significant gaps in the literature, including a lack of study on suprathreshold stimulation of right unilateral ECT and the possibility of a greater effect with higher medication doses.",

    "5": "This review is based on the current medical literature available to the general medical community.", 
    "6": "Nerve agents are some of the deadliest substances known to humanity. Though they kill primarily via muscle paralysis, which leads to respiratory arrest, these agents affect virtually every organ system in the body. Their primary mechanism of action is the body-wide inhibition of cholinesterases. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine, stimulating both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. After decontamination, the primary treatment is with atropine to control muscarinic symptoms and with oximes to reactivate the cholinesterases and treat the nicotinic symptoms. Atropine doses can be much higher than conventionally used. Seizures are generally best treated with benzodiazepines. Patients with substantial exposure may require ventilatory and intensive care unit support for prolonged periods of time.", 
    "7": "While it is unlikely that most medical practitioners will ever encounter nerve agent poisoning, it is critical to be aware of the presenting symptoms and how best to treat patients exposed to these deadly agents. History has shown that rapid medical treatment can easily mean the difference between life and death for a patient in this situation.", 
    "8": ": Evans et al. (2017) have pointed out how frequently and pervasively nonmedical prescription opioid use is associated with severe pain in young adults, especially young white males. This is a subset of such nonmedical users at tremendous risk of overdose (indeed 1/3 of the study respondents had an overdose event), especially given their concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Avoiding further contributing to the catastrophic rise in overdoses requires access to comprehensive pain care for these young adults. If they were to require opioid therapy, it would have to be in the context of a highly complex and expert variety of such care. If we fail to make it available, we will fail to address the root cause of overdoses for a sizeable subset of nonmedical prescription opioid users.", 
    "9": "Complications related to methamphetamine use and abuse are common presentations seen in the emergency department. Standard management focuses on addressing the central nervous system and cardiovascular effects with the use of sedation and hemodynamic support. We describe a case report of a patient with methamphetamine toxicity and subsequent severe cardiomyopathy refractory to conventional management that responded to cardiovascular support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (ECMO). A 22-year-old female was admitted in severe cardiogenic shock following intravenous administration of methamphetamine and oral fentanyl use. Despite aggressive treatment with benzodiazepines, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, vasodilators, antibiotics and inotropes, the patient's clinical status deteriorated, and she suffered a cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated, and following the return of spontaneous circulation, ECMO was initiated. After 82 hours the patient was successfully weaned from ECMO with the recovery of her left ventricular function and no neurologic sequelae. The patient developed leg ischemia requiring embolectomy and open repair as a complication of ECMO cannulation. In our case, ECMO was used successfully in treating severe cardiac dysfunction from acute methamphetamine-induced cardiomyopathy and was used as a bridge to recovery. The complications seen in this patient emphasize the potential risks associated with this intervention and highlight the need for careful patient selection.",

    "11": "We used a 10% sample of individual-level nationwide dispensing claims for concessional beneficiaries dispensed psychotropic medications (stratified by class, subclass) to investigate annual trends and changes in the incidence and prevalence of use, median annual duration of exposure, proportion of people with single psychotropic dispensing and median defined daily doses per person dispensed each medicine per year.", 
    "12": "Over the study period, there was a 26.1% decrease in the incidence and a 2.6% increase in the prevalence of all psychotropic medicine use. We observed a decrease in the annual incidence and prevalence of antidepressants (11.6% and 16.8%, respectively) but increases in the median annual duration of exposure (7.4%). Amitriptyline had the highest proportion of single dispensings of all antidepressants throughout the study period (26.5% in 2015) and defined daily doses per person dispensed each medicine per year increased by 20% for antidepressants overall. Benzodiazepine use decreased across all measures over the study period apart from long-term use (exposure for >240 days of the year), which in 2015 was 23.6% of those dispensed a benzodiazepine. We observed a relative increase in the incidence and prevalence of antipsychotic use (14.2% and 26.8%, respectively), and haloperidol had the highest proportion of single dispensings of any antipsychotic throughout the study period (47.5% in 2015). We observed a relative increase in the incidence and prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medication use of 114.0% and 101.8%, respectively, over the study period.", 
    "13": "Increasing doses and treatment durations of antidepressants warrants further investigation due to concerns about overuse. Single dispensings of amitriptyline and haloperidol may indicate off-label use and long-term use of benzodiazepines remains problematic. Despite increases in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medication use, prevalence of use is still much lower than the estimated prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in the adult population.",

We included trials meeting our selection criteria and providing useable data.", 
    "18": "We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), and for cognitive outcomes we derived standardised mean difference (SMD) effect sizes, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and using a fixed-effect model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce 'Summary of findings' tables which included our pre-specified main outcomes of interest.", 
    "19": "We found nine new RCTs from the 2016 update search, giving a total of 41 included studies and 24 comparisons. Few studies were undertaken in circumstances that reflect real-world practice, and, with notable exceptions, most were small and carried considerable risk of bias. Due to the large number of comparisons, we can only present a summary of main results.Compared with placebo, more people in the haloperidol group were asleep at two hours (2 RCTs, n=220, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.82 to 0.95, very low-quality evidence) and experienced dystonia (2 RCTs, n=207, RR 7.49, 95%CI 0.93 to 60.21, very low-quality evidence).Compared with aripiprazole, people in the haloperidol group required fewer injections than those in the aripiprazole group (2 RCTs, n=473, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.62 to 0.99, low-quality evidence). More people in the haloperidol group experienced dystonia (2 RCTs, n=477, RR 6.63, 95%CI 1.52 to 28.86, very low-quality evidence).Four trials (n=207) compared haloperidol with lorazepam with no significant differences with regard to number of participants asleep at one hour (1 RCT, n=60, RR 1.05, 95%CI 0.76 to 1.44, very low-quality of evidence) or those requiring additional injections (1 RCT, n=66, RR 1.14, 95%CI 0.91 to 1.43, very low-quality of evidence).Haloperidol's adverse effects were not offset by addition of lorazepam (e.g. dystonia 1 RCT, n=67, RR 8.25, 95%CI 0.46 to 147.45, very low-quality of evidence).Addition of promethazine was investigated in two trials (n=376). More people in the haloperidol group were not tranquil or asleep by 20 minutes (1 RCT, n=316, RR 1.60, 95%CI 1.18 to 2.16, moderate-quality evidence). Acute dystonia was too common in the haloperidol alone group for the trial to continue beyond the interim analysis (1 RCT, n=316, RR 19.48, 95%CI 1.14 to 331.92, low-quality evidence).", 
    "20": "Additional data from new studies does not alter previous conclusions of this review. If no other alternative exists, sole use of intramuscular haloperidol could be life-saving. Where additional drugs are available, sole use of haloperidol for extreme emergency could be considered unethical. Addition of the sedating promethazine has support from better-grade evidence from within randomised trials. Use of an alternative antipsychotic drug is only partially supported by fragmented and poor-grade evidence. Adding a benzodiazepine to haloperidol does not have strong evidence of benefit and carries risk of additional harm.After six decades of use for emergency rapid tranquillisation, this is still an area in need of good independent trials relevant to real-world practice.", 
    "21": "Our previous study demonstrated that there have been changes in the patterns of prescription antipsychotic use in China over the period from 2002 to 2012. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether time trends were present for the prescription of anticholinergic medications (ACMs) during the observation period. A total of 14,013 patients with schizophrenia treated in 45 psychiatric hospitals/centers nationwide were surveyed in 2002, 2006 and 2012. Basic socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and the prescription of psychotropic drugs were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure. The frequency of ACM prescription was 25.9% in the whole sample (29.5%, 21.6%, and 27.4% in 2002, 2006 and 2012, respectively). In addition, different temporal trends were observed across age groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the entire sample showed that ACM prescriptions were predicted by females, outpatients, patients receiving high doses of antipsychotic medication, select study years, benzodiazepine users, patients displaying extrapyramidal side effects, as well as antipsychotic prescription patterns. Although there was more widespread use of second-generation antipsychotics over the past decade, the frequency of ACM use only slightly decreased. How to use ACM appropriately is still a therapeutic issue that needs to foster evidence-based prescription practice.",

(2) Associated disorders are similar to that found in adults; however, schizophrenia is more frequently observed than mood disorder. Additionally, a history of neurodevelopmental disorders maybe encountered. (3) Morbidity and mortality are among the worst in child psychiatry. (4) Underlying organic conditions are highly prevalent (>20% of the cases), and their search is warranted because some diagnoses may result in specific treatments (e.g., immune-suppressor therapy for autoimmune conditions). (5) Symptomatic approaches - high dose of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - are as efficient in children or adolescents as they are in adults, but this finding needs to be acknowledged because a resistance against the use of ECT or high-dose medication exists among child psychiatrists.",

    "26": "The use of levetiracetam (LEV) in the management of drug-induced seizures has not been systematically investigated. Repetitive and continuous seizures that do not respond to benzodiazepines require second line therapy. Levetiracetam has a unique receptor binding site, rapid absorption, no known cardiac effects at therapeutic doses, and is theoretically a good candidate for use in drug-induced seizures.

We included patients with a drug-induced seizure based on history, electroencephalogram results, blood alcohol concentrations, urine drug screens, and adequate documentation. We excluded patients with alcohol withdrawal, anoxic brain injury, subtherapeutic concentrations of other antiepileptics, hypoglycemia, and pseudoseizures. Primary outcomes of interest included cessation of active seizures or the prevention of seizure recurrence. We assessed safety by the presence or absence of adverse drug effects (ADE) attributed to the administration of LEV.",

Half of the study cohort (17) presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (TCS); half (17) presented in generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). Six patients in GCSE received LEV during their seizures; 2 also received fosphenytoin. One improved immediately following LEV administration, and the remaining 5 had seizure control. Eleven GCSE patients (65%) remained seizure free after LEV therapy. The patients with TCS (17) received LEV after seizure(s) control. Sixteen (94%) were seizure-free during their hospital course. We found no adverse drug effects. In total, 27 of 34 patients (79%) had a return to baseline neurological and physical health. Six had long-term sequelae; none of which are known LEV side-effects. We identified 46 toxic substances and 22 known seizurogenic agents (48%). The median length of stay was 3.7 days (0.4-96), and the median duration of in-hospital LEV therapy was 1.6 days (0-49).",

Classic DTDS. Infants typically manifest nonspecific findings (irritability, feeding difficulties, axial hypotonia, and/or delayed motor development) followed by a hyperkinetic movement disorder (with features of chorea, dystonia, ballismus, orolingual dyskinesia). Over time, affected individuals develop parkinsonism-dystonia characterized by bradykinesia (progressing to akinesia), dystonic posturing, distal tremor, rigidity, and reduced facial expression. Limitation of voluntary movements leads to severe motor delay. Episodic status dystonicus, exacerbations of dystonia, and secondary orthopedic, gastrointestinal, and respiratory complications are common. Many affected individuals appear to show relative preservation of intellect with good cognitive development. Atypical DTDS.

Prevention of secondary complications: Regular physiotherapy to reduce the risk of contractures; early referral for management of feeding difficulties; use of influenza vaccine, prophylactic antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy for patients prone to chest infections, especially in the winter months. Surveillance: Evaluation every six to 12 months for early evidence of hip dislocation and/or spinal deformity; regular assessment of swallowing to evaluate risk for aspiration; regular nutrition assessment to ensure adequate caloric intake. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although the dopamine agonists bromocriptine and pergolide could be considered, the associated increased risk of pulmonary, retroperitoneal, and pericardial fibrosis makes them less desirable than the newer dopamine agonists. Drugs with anti-dopaminergic side effects (e.g., some antihistamines, sedatives, and dimenhydrinate) may exacerbate the movement disorder.

The previous version of this review, which included 13 randomised clinical trials, found no effect of flumazenil on all-cause mortality, based on an analysis of 10 randomised clinical trials, but found a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy, based on an analysis of eight randomised clinical trials.",

We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains; determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE; evaluated the risk of small-study effects in regression analyses; and conducted trial sequential, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses.", 
    "63": "We identified 14 eligible randomised clinical trials with 867 participants, the majority of whom had an acute episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, we identified one ongoing randomised clinical trial. We were unable to gather outcome data from 2 randomised clinical trials with 25 participants. Thus, our analyses include 842 participants from 12 randomised clinical trials comparing flumazenil versus placebo. We classified one randomised clinical trial at low risk of bias in the overall assessment and the remaining randomised clinical trials at high risk of bias. The duration of follow-up ranged from a few minutes to two weeks, but it was less than one day in the majority of the trials.In total, 32/433 (7.4%) participants allocated to flumazenil versus 38/409 (9.3%) participants allocated to placebo died (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.16; 11 randomised clinical trials; low quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis and the one randomised clinical trial assessed as low risk of bias (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.53) found no beneficial or harmful effects of flumazenil on all-cause mortality. The methods used to evaluate hepatic encephalopathy included several different clinical scales, electrophysiological variables, and psychometric tests. Flumazenil was associated with a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy when including all randomised clinical trials (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.80; 824 participants; 9 randomised clinical trials; low quality evidence), or just the trial at low risk of bias (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.84; 527 participants). The Trial Sequential Analysis supported a beneficial effect of flumazenil on hepatic encephalopathy. The randomised clinical trials included little information about causes of death and little information on non-fatal serious adverse events.",

At 3 months after the change, 36.0% of patients remained on BNX-RDT at equivalent dose, 9.1% were prescribed a higher dose of BNX-RDT, 52.7% were switched back to their previous formulation after a trial of BNX-RDT, and 2.2% dropped out of care. There was no significant change in the rates of aberrant urine drug tests pre and postchange (36.6% vs 33.7%; P\u200a=\u200a0.27) or in any individual component of urine drug testing. Age, sex, and starting dose were not associated with remaining on BNX-RDT at equivalent dose, compared with increasing dose or changing formulation.",

    "93": "Benzodiazepines are among the most widely prescribed and misused psychopharmaceutical drugs. Although they are well-tolerated, they are also capable of producing amnestic effects similar to those observed after pharmacological or organic cholinergic dysfunction. To date, the effect of benzodiazepine diazepam on the memory for discrimination of anticholinergic drugs has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to analyze the immediate and long-term effects of diazepam on a drug discrimination task with scopolamine. Male Wistar rats were trained to discriminate between scopolamine and saline administration using a two-lever discrimination task. Once discrimination was acquired, the subjects were divided into three independent groups, (1) control, (2) diazepam, and (3) diazepam chronic administration (10\u00a0days). Subsequently, generalization curves for scopolamine were obtained. Additionally, the diazepam and control groups were revaluated after 90\u00a0days without having been given any other treatment. The results showed that diazepam produced a significant reduction in the generalization gradient for scopolamine, indicating an impairment of discrimination. The negative effect of diazepam persisted even 90\u00a0days after drug had been administered. Meanwhile, the previous administration of diazepam for 10\u00a0days totally abated the generalization curve and the general performance of the subjects. The results suggest that diazepam affects memory for the stimulus discrimination of anticholinergic drugs and does so persistently, which could be an important consideration during the treatment of amnesic patients with benzodiazepines.",

    "99": "Dried matrix spot (DMS) technique as alternative sampling strategy, especially dried urine spots (DUS), might be an alternative for drug screening. So far only particular drugs or drug classes were covered in DMS screenings. Therefore, workup of DUS for a broad comprehensive library-based LC-MS(n) screening was developed. It consisted of enzymatic on-spot deconjugation followed by liquid extraction and LC-MS(n) analysis. This workup was compared to established urine precipitation (UP) and validated according to international guidelines for qualitative approaches, using exemplary compounds of several drug classes (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, cardiovascular drugs, neuroleptics, opioids, stimulants, etc.) with a broad range of (physico-)chemical properties and chromatographic behaviors. On-spot conjugate cleavage and liquid extraction was sufficient for most compounds and the validation results comparable to those obtained after simple UP. For demonstrating the applicability, 103 authentic urine samples, six rat urine samples after low dose substance administrations, and two proficiency tests for systematic toxicological urinalysis were worked up with the new DUS approach or by UP without or with conjugate cleavage. In the authentic urine samples, 112 different drugs out of 43 categories plus metabolites were identified via the used LC-MS(n) library. With the new DUS approach, 5% less positive hits could be found compared to the UP approach and 15% less than the latter after conjugate cleavage. The differences should be caused mainly by smaller urine volumes used for DUS. In the two proficiency tests, all 15 drugs could be detected. Unfortunately, all three approaches were not able to detect very low-dosed substances in rat urine samples. However, they could be detected using a more sensitive LC-high resolution-MS/MS approach showing that the DUS workup was also suitable for those. In conclusion, DUS might be an alternative sampling technique for comprehensive drug testing or adherence monitoring.",

Several bioactivities including anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, and anti-tumor effects were attributed to bisabolol. However, the neuropharmacological properties of bisabolol have not yet been reported. The present study evaluated behavioral effects of bisabolol using elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), and rotarod test. Moreover, this study also examined whether the 5-HT1A and GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor systems are involved in the anxiolytic-like effects of bisabolol. After acute intraperitoneal treatment with bisabolol at the doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10\u00a0mg/kg, OFT, EPM, and rotarod were utilized for investigating behavioral effects. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and WAY-100635, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, were used to determine the action mechanism in the EPM. Bisabolol especially at the dose of 1\u00a0mg/kg was effective in increasing the total number of entries and time spent in the open arms of EPM while number of rearing and grooming in OFT was decreased in comparison to the control. In the rotarod, permanence time was decreased in the mice treated with the high doses of bisabolol. Pretreatment with flumazenil, but not WAY-100635, was able to reverse the effect of bisabolol 1\u00a0mg/kg in the EPM, indicating that the anxiolytic-like activity of bisabolol occurs via the GABAergic but not serotonergic transmission. The present study supports the idea that bisabolol may mediate its anxiolytic-like and sedative mechanisms involving GABAA receptors.",

    "120": "Benzodiazepines can ameliorate social disturbances and increase social competition, particularly in high-anxious individuals. However, the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying benzodiazepines' effects in social competition are not understood. Converging evidence points to the mesolimbic system as a potential site of action for at least some benzodiazepine-mediated effects. Furthermore, mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been causally implicated in the link between anxiety and social competitiveness. Here, we show that diazepam facilitates social dominance, ameliorating both the competitive disadvantage and low NAc mitochondrial function displayed by high-anxious rats, and identify the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as a key site of action for direct diazepam effects. We also show that intra-VTA diazepam infusion increases accumbal dopamine and DOPAC, as well as activity of dopamine D1- but not D2-containing cells. In addition, intra-NAc infusion of a D1-, but not D2, receptor agonist facilitates social dominance and mitochondrial respiration. Conversely, intra-VTA diazepam actions on social dominance and NAc mitochondrial respiration are blocked by pharmacological NAc micro-infusion of a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor or an antagonist of D1 receptors. Our data support the view that diazepam disinhibits VTA dopaminergic neurons, leading to the release of dopamine into the NAc where activation of D1-signaling transiently facilitates mitochondrial function, that is, increased respiration and enhanced ATP levels, which ultimately enhances social competitive behavior. Therefore, our findings critically involve the mesolimbic system in the facilitating effects of diazepam on social competition and highlight mitochondrial function as a potential therapeutic target for anxiety-related social dysfunctions.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 20 July 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.135.", 
    "121": "Background Diazepam, as one of the most frequent prescribed drug from 1,4-benzodiazepine group, has certain limitations in pharmaceutical technology due to its poor solubility in water. By forming inclusion complexes with 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, diazepam's biopharmaceutical properties can be greatly improved. Aim Aim of this research was to in vitro evaluate genotoxicity of prepared novel complexes of diazepam and their influence on proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Methods For identification of possible genotoxicity of diazepam inclusion complexes, cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay has been chosen. Evaluated concentrations of two diazepam inclusion complexes were 0.2\u2009\u00b5g/mL, 0.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL and 1.0\u2009\u00b5g/mL in cell culture. For a reference, in vitro cytogenotoxicity evaluation of diazepam alone has been conducted as well. Results Neither one of the diazepam, complexed nor non-complexed, in given concentrations showed genotoxicity, induced genetic damage or loss of genetic material. Conclusions Nuclear division index values, as indicators of cytostaticity and cytotoxicity suggested that investigated inclusion diazepam complexes induced accelerated proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, therefore possibly shortening the duration and dynamics of the cell cycle.",

The existence of this wide variety of subunits as well as their diverse assembly into different subunit compositions result in miscellaneous receptor subtypes. In combination with the large number of known and putative allosteric binding sites, this leads to a highly complex pharmacology. Recently, a novel binding site at extracellular \u03b1+/\u03b2- interfaces was described as the site of modulatory action of several pyrazoloquinolinones. In this study we report a highly potent ligand from this class of compounds with pronounced \u03b21-selectivity that mainly lacks \u03b1-subunit selectivity. It constitutes the most potent \u03b21-selective positive allosteric modulatory ligand with known binding site. In addition, a proof of concept pyrazoloquinolinone ligand lacking the additional high affinity interaction with the benzodiazepine binding site is presented.

However, tolerance and dependence are important side effects. Sedating antidepressants are frequently prescribed for insomnia, however, only few randomised controlled trials have been published so far. Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists are considered to be an option for the treatment of insomnia especially because of their minimal abuse potential and safety. First data on orexin (aka hypocretin) receptor antagonists are promising, however, the risk-benefit ratio needs to be further evaluated. With respect to circadian rhythm sleep disorders, there is solid evidence from meta-analyses supporting the use of melatonin in jet lag disorder to accelerate entrainment to the new time zone, and in delayed sleep phase disorder to advance sleep-wake rhythms.

All bodies showed a degree of destruction by fire consisting to a level 3 of the Crow-Glassman Scale (CGS) and early stage of insect activity. Toxicological analyses were performed on soft tissues and body fluids still available. The results were positive for diazepam and its metabolites only for children with blood concentrations consistent with therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. Home video surveillance cameras confirmed sedation prior to death recording the mother while administering some drops of sedative drugs in a soft drink to the children just a couple of hours before setting fire to the car. Based on autopsy findings, all victims were still alive at the time of fire. The cause of death was determined as carbon monoxide poisoning and fatal thermal injuries by fire. This case study has a special focus on the entomotoxicology and the potential role of insects in death investigations of burnt bodies, supposed to be an inadequate substratum for insect colonization. It demonstrates that in burnt bodies, arthropod colonization can be quite immediate after fire is extinguished. Toxicological analyses performed on larvae actively feeding on the children's bodies were positive for diazepam and its metabolites in small amount compared with blood concentrations, whereas the larvae collected from the mother's body were totally negative. These data, according to the autopsy findings and the toxicological results from the victim's blood and tissues, supported the suspect of a non-lethal sedation prior to death, which is a common behaviour in maternal filicide.",

To address treatment barriers and confounding, patients were required to have filled one or more prescriptions for any medication in the 90 days and 91-180 days before the index date (ie, the date of starting benzodiazepine treatment for initiators and the date of the selected medical visit for benzodiazepine non-initiators) and the high dimensional propensity score was estimated on the basis of more than 300 covariates.Main outcome measure\u00a0All cause mortality, determined by linkage with the Social Security Administration Death Master File.Results\u00a0Over a six month follow-up period, 5061 and 4691 deaths occurred among high dimensional propensity score matched benzodiazepine initiators versus non-initiators (9.3 v 9.4 events per 1000 person years; hazard ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.04). A 4% (95% confidence interval 1% to 8%) to 9% (2% to 7%) increase in mortality risk was observed associated with the start of benzodiazepine treatment for follow-ups of 12 and 48 months and in subgroups of younger patients and patients initiating short acting agents. In secondary analyses comparing 1:1 high dimensional propensity score matched patients initiating benzodiazepines with an active comparator, ie, patients starting treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, benzodiazepine use was associated with a 9% (95% confidence interval 3% to 16%) increased risk.Conclusions\u00a0This large population based cohort study suggests either no increase or at most a minor increase in risk of all cause mortality associated with benzodiazepine initiation. If a detrimental effect exists, it is likely to be much smaller than previously stated and to have uncertain clinical relevance. Residual confounding likely explains at least part of the small increase in mortality risk observed in selected analyses.",

The urine samples originated from patient samples confirmed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) analysis to contain flubromazolam or pyrazolam. The LC-HRMS/MS system consisted of an YMC-UltraHT Hydrosphere C18 column coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Orbitrap MS operating in positive electrospray mode.

Neurocognitive impairments were reported in patients who on average used benzodiazepines for 5-15 years. In addition, sensitivity to acute benzodiazepine impairment decreased in long-term users, suggesting (partial) tolerance. Definitions of clinical relevance of neurocognitive impairments in long-term users and how these were affected by duration of benzodiazepine use were generally lacking.

The sampling during special social settings, the analysis with improved analytical techniques, and data processing with specific workflow to narrow the search, are required approaches for a successful monitoring. This work presents the application of a qualitative screening technique to wastewater samples collected during a city festival, where likely users of recreational substances gather and consequently higher residual concentrations of used NPS are expected. The analysis was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Data were processed using an algorithm that involves the extraction of accurate masses (calculated based on molecular formula) of expected m/z from an in-house database containing about 2,000 entries, including NPS and transformation products. We positively identified eight NPS belonging to the classes of synthetic cathinones, phenethylamines and opioids. In addition, the presence of benzodiazepine analogues, classical drugs and other licit substances with potential for abuse was confirmed. The screening workflow based on a database search was useful in the identification of NPS biomarkers in wastewater. The findings highlight the specific classical drugs and low NPS use in the Netherlands. Additionally, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B), and 4-fluoroamphetamine (FA) were identified in wastewater for the first time.", 
    "230": "Background Due to their addictive potential, benzodiazepine (BZ) and non-benzodiazepine-agonists (NBZ, so-called Z-drugs) should be taken no longer than 6 weeks. BZ and NBZ are primarily prescribed by general practitioners (GPs). Therefore, we aimed to analyze GPs' data on the patients collective, the amount of BZ/NBZ prescribed and the rate of private prescriptions. Methods We analyzed person years of 2-year intervals from 2009 to 2014 of the primary care CONTENT register that contains routine data from 31 general practitioners' practices. We classified BZ/NBZ prescriptions according to risk groups. The association of BZ/NBZ prescription and potential influencing factors was analyzed by calculating the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (and corresponding p-value) on the basis of a multiple logistic regression model (adjusted by age, sex and type of health insurance). All patients with drug prescription with and without BZ/NBZ-prescription were compared. Results Almost 5% of patients with drug prescriptions received at least one prescription of BZ/NBZ during 1 year of observation. On average these patients were older (67.5 vs. 48 years respectively) and the proportion of women was higher than in the comparison group (69 vs. 58%). About one-third of these patients received more than 600\u2009mg diazepam equivalent dose per person year (according to a 2-month daily intake of more than 10\u2009mg diazepam). About one-third of the prescriptions were private prescriptions. A number of variables were significantly associated with the prescription of BZ/NBZ (e.\u2009g. age, gender, diagnosis codes, practices). Conclusion The results provide valuable information about BZ/NBZ prescription routines in general practice. For continuous medical education as well as the development of interventions to reduce the use of BZ/NBZ, patient characteristics (e.\u2009g. sex, age, comorbidities, type of insurance) as well as different prescription routines (e.\u2009g. private prescriptions, reason and frequency of prescriptions, guideline orientation) should be considered.",

    "232": "Introduction Depression is a mental disorder likely to affect everyday functions. The present study aimed to assess actual driving performance of depressed patients who were without specific antidepressant treatment or received long-term antidepressant treatment. Methods A standardized on-the-road driving test was used to assess standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) in 3 patient groups receiving either no antidepressant treatment (with or without benzodiazepine medication) or treatment with selective serotonin/noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors for a period of 6-52 weeks. Severity of depression was assessed using Beck's Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The performance of patient groups was compared to healthy controls. Results The mean SDLP of untreated and treated patients was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. Driving impairment in the long-term treated group was significantly less than in the untreated groups. SDLP was positively correlated to severity of depression across all groups. Discussion It is concluded that symptoms of depression are a major cause of driving impairment. Reductions in severity of depression through antidepressant treatment reduce severity of driving impairment.", 
    "233": "Insomnia accounts for more than 5.5 million visits to family physicians each year. Although behavioral interventions are the mainstay of treatment, pharmacologic therapy may be necessary for some patients. Understanding the risks and benefits of insomnia medications is critical. Controlled-release melatonin and doxepin are recommended as first-line agents in older adults; the so-called z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon) should be reserved for use if the first-line agents are ineffective. For the general population with difficulty falling asleep, controlled-release melatonin and the z-drugs can be considered. For those who have difficulty staying asleep, low-dose doxepin and the z-drugs should be considered. Benzodiazepines are not recommended because of their high abuse potential and the availability of better alternatives. Although the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant appears to be relatively effective, it is no more effective than the z-drugs and much more expensive. Sedating antihistamines, antiepileptics, and atypical antipsychotics are not recommended unless they are used primarily to treat another condition. Persons with sleep apnea or chronic lung disease with nocturnal hypoxia should be evaluated by a sleep specialist before sedating medications are prescribed.",

    "237": "Most (88.4%) patients were on pharmacological treatment, with 53.8% of persons taking \u22653 medications. No significant changes in these percentages were observed over the study period. The use of tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines decreased, while the use of atypical antipsychotics increased. Axis I comorbidity was the main factor associated with pharmacological treatment and polypharmacy.", 
    "238": "This study provides further evidence confirming the worldwide overuse of prescription medications for BPD and shows that there has been a shift in the prescription pattern in the last 15 years. These results suggest that real clinical practice only partially adheres to clinical treatment guidelines.", 
    "239": "Perioperative use of serotonergic agents increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. We describe the occurrence of serotonin syndrome after fentanyl use in two patients taking multiple serotonergic agents.", 
    "240": "Two patients who had been taking multiple serotonergic medications or herbal supplements (one patient taking fluoxetine, turmeric supplement, and acyclovir; the other taking fluoxetine and trazodone) developed serotonin syndrome perioperatively when undergoing outpatient procedures. Both experienced acute loss of consciousness and generalized myoclonus after receiving fentanyl. In one patient, the serotonin syndrome promptly resolved after naloxone administration. In the other patient, the onset of serotonin syndrome was delayed and manifested after discharge, most likely attributed to the intraoperative use of midazolam for sedation.", 
    "241": "Even small doses of fentanyl administered to patients taking multiple serotonergic medications and herbal supplements may trigger serotonin syndrome. Prompt reversal of serotonin toxicity in one patient by naloxone illustrates the likely opioid-mediated pathogenesis of serotonin syndrome in this case. It also highlights that taking serotonergic agents concomitantly can produce the compounding effect that causes serotonin syndrome. The delayed presentation of serotonin syndrome in the patient who received a large dose of midazolam suggests that outpatients taking multiple serotonergic drugs who receive benzodiazepines may require longer postprocedural monitoring.", 
    "242": "Benzodiazepines are recommended for short-term use due to risk of dependence. This study examined characteristics associated with benzodiazepine and opioid dispensing of 7+ days in a Medicaid population with substance use disorder (SUD).",

The highest rates were among those aged 45-64 (IRR=2.38, p<0.0001) and with non-alcohol SUDs (IRR=1.12, p<0.0001). Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression (IRR=1.41, p<0.0001), had high rates of benzodiazepine fills. Receiving a 7+ day oral opioid fill (IRR=1.30, p<0.0001) coincided with increased benzodiazepine dispensing. Similar results occurred for longer-term prescribing of opioids, with higher rates among those with non-alcohol SUDs (IRR=1.23, p< 0.0001).", 
    "245": "For many people with SUDs, receiving a benzodiazepine or opioid prescription of 7+ days is not a single occurrence; patients in our sample were more likely to receive 2+ fills than to receive one. Longer-term prescribing is most pronounced among those with co-occurring anxiety disorders. This suggests that anxiety in those with SUD should preferentially not be treated using benzodiazepines. Longer-term polypharmacy with benzodiazepines and opioids coincided. Overdoses among those using both drugs are growing and this study provides evidence that attention to the opioid epidemic should include attention to polypharmacy that includes benzodiazepines.", 
    "246": "Statins and benzodiazepines are widely used drugs, especially in ischemic heart disease, where exacerbation caused by anxiety can even lead to cardiac death. There have not been any reports of statin drug interaction with anxiolytics so far, but it is possible that these drugs interact with each other. We examined the effect of chronic oral administration of simvastatin on the anxiolytic activity and pharmacokinetics of diazepam in rats.", 
    "247": "Studies were conducted on male Wistar Han rats treated with simvastatin (2.5, 5, 10, 20mg/kg) for 4-6 weeks, and/or diazepam (2.5, 5, 10mg/kg) administered once on the day of the study. Evaluation of potential pharmacodynamic interaction was based on the behavioral tests: elevated plus maze (EPM) test and the Vogel conflict test (VCT). The assessment of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction was based on measurements of concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites in the blood of animals.", 
    "248": "Diazepam 5 and 10mg/kg given together with simvastatin 10 and 20mg/kg showed no anxiolytic effect in the EPM test. In the VCT diazepam combinations with simvastatin did not produce any anxiolytic effect either, with an exception of the co-administration of diazepam 10mg/kg and simvastatin 10mg/kg. Simvastatin (20mg/kg) significantly reduced the area under curve (AUC) of diazepam by 51.6% and temazepam by 54.6%.", 
    "249": "Abolition of diazepam anxiolytic effect during concomitant use of simvastatin is probably caused by diminished bioavailability of diazepam, although pharmacodynamic interaction between these drugs cannot be excluded.",

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for prediction of missed NCSE by these variables was 0.839. Independent predictors for not receiving benzodiazepines were increasing age (ORper year 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p = 0.008) and higher Glasgow Coma Scale score (ORper increasing unit 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.36, p = 0.001).

In this article, we discuss the vital elements of this approach and possible complications of NPS intoxication. This is illustrated by two 20-year-old male patients with NPS intoxication who presented to our ER as participants in a group intoxication. Patient A suffered from mild symptoms and tested positive for 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine (2C-I-NBOMe) only.

We extracted data records of 285 Caucasian patients after 18 weeks of antipsychotic treatments to investigate risk factors of blood dyscrasias. We observed a higher risk to develop both transient and persistent anemia, neutrophilia and eosinophilia in clozapine-treated patients, whereas in those treated with other atypical antipsychotics when compared to a reference group under typical antipsychotics, emerged an increased risk for transient neutrophilia and eosinophilia. Male patients revealed a higher risk of persistent eosinophilia, neutrophilia, and leukocytosis. Concomitant treatments with mood stabilizers or benzodiazepines proved to be risk factors for transient anemia, antidepressants for transient eosinophilia. Severe complications emerged in 3 cases of agranulocytosis. Cross-tabulation analysis showed a higher probability of a poor response in clozapine-treated patients with persistent anemia and a positive with persistent neutrophilia and eosinophilia. Our data evidenced that emerging blood dyscrasias were not associated with critical adverse effects, and only agranulocytosis required a treatment interruption. Other atypical antipsychotics might represent a viable alternative to potentially harmful clozapine and typical antipsychotics at the onset of life-threatening haematological alterations.",

    "284": "Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is the most common life-threatening childhood neurological emergency. Despite this, there is a lack of high quality evidence supporting medication use after first line benzodiazepines, with current treatment protocols based solely on non-experimental evidence and expert opinion. The current standard of care, phenytoin, is only 60% effective, and associated with considerable adverse effects. A newer anti-convulsant, levetiracetam, can be given faster, is potentially more efficacious, with a more tolerable side effect profile. The primary aim of the study presented in this protocol is to determine whether intravenous (IV) levetiracetam or IV phenytoin is the better second line treatment for the emergency management of CSE in children.", 
    "285": "200 children aged between 3\u00a0months and 16\u00a0years presenting to 13 emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand with CSE, that has failed to stop with first line benzodiazepines, will be enrolled into this multicentre open randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to 40\u00a0mg/kg IV levetiracetam infusion over 5\u00a0min or 20\u00a0mg/kg IV phenytoin infusion over 20\u00a0min. The primary outcome for the study is clinical cessation of seizure activity five minutes following the completion of the infusion of the study medication. Blinded confirmation of the primary outcome will occur with the primary outcome assessment being video recorded and assessed by a primary outcome assessment team blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes include: Clinical cessation of seizure activity at two hours; Time to clinical seizure cessation; Need for rapid sequence induction; Intensive care unit (ICU) admission; Serious adverse events; Length of Hospital/ICU stay; Health care costs; Seizure status/death at one-month post discharge.",

    "289": "Driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) is a worldwide problem. Several countries have adopted DUID legislations which prove their deterrent effect and impact on road safety. However, the use of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and prescription drugs is not known, as the applied roadside screening tests have not yet been adapted for these compounds. In this study, 558 blood samples obtained during roadside controls in Belgium (January to August 2015) after a positive Drugwipe 5S\u00ae test and 199 oral fluid (OF) samples obtained from negatively screened test pads were analyzed. The NPS positivity rate was 7% in blood, while it reached 11% in OF. NPS detected were: diphenidine, ketamine, 4-fluoroamphetamine, 2-amino-indane, methoxetamine, \u03b1-PVP, methiopropamine, a mix of 5-MAPB/5-EAPB, TH-PVP, mephedrone, methedrone, 4-methylethylcathinone, 5-MeO-DALT, 4-Acetoxy-DiPT, AB Fubinaca, FUB-JWH018, JWH020, trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine, and ethylphenidate. Moreover, 17% of blood samples (and 5% of OF) contained an analgesic drug, 10% (0.5%) a benzodiazepine/hypnotic, 5% (2%) an antidepressant, 2% (3%) an antipsychotic, 2% an antiepileptic drug, and 1% methylphenidate. The presence of NPS in the young (and predominately male) DUID population is proven. Furthermore, a high level of poly-drug use including combinations of NPS, licit, and drugs of abuse was observed. Further research concerning the development of on-site NPS detection techniques should be established. Meanwhile, the effects of combined drug use on driving ability and the physical/psychological signs after NPS use should be performed to improve the on-site DUID detection of NPS by police officers, so they can engage in blood sampling for a general unknown screening.", 
    "290": "Nausea is a common symptom among patients affected by chronic diseases or undergoing various treatments. Because nausea can result from many origins, there is a large differential diagnosis to explore. Its pathophysiology relies on numerous neurotransmitters, on which 5 types of antiemetic antagonists are effective (NK-1 receptor antagonists, antiserotoninergic, antidopaminergic, antihistaminic and anticholinergic agents). Glucocorticoids and benzodiazepines are also used to treat some types of nausea. Choosing the appropriate antiemetic can improve quality of life and treatment compliance.",

Participants were recruited between April and August 2014 from a national database based on the electoral roll. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) tool. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), and pelvic floor symptoms were assessed using validated questionnaires. Women were provided a comprehensive list of psychotropic medications (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers) to identify their use over the preceding month.",
