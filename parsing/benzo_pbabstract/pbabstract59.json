    "0": "Compound-induced pancreatic injury is a serious liability in preclinical toxicity studies. However, its relevance to humans should be cautiously evaluated because of interspecies variations. To highlight such variations, we evaluated the species- and dose-specific pancreatic responses and progression caused by GI181771X, a novel cholecystokinin 1 receptor agonist investigated by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of obesity. Acute (up to 2,000 mg/kg GI181771X, as single dose) and repeat-dose studies in mice and/or rats (0.25-250 mg/kg/day for 7 days to 26 weeks) showed wide-ranging morphological changes in the pancreas that were dose and duration dependent, including necrotizing pancreatitis, acinar cell hypertrophy/atrophy, zymogen degranulation, focal acinar cell hyperplasia, and interstitial inflammation. In contrast to rodents, pancreatic changes were not observed in cynomolgus monkeys given GI181771X (1-500 mg/kg/day with higher systemic exposure than rats) for up to 52 weeks. Similarly, no GI181771X treatment-associated abnormalities in pancreatic structure were noted in a 24-week clinical trial with obese patients (body mass index >30 or >27 kg/m(2)) as assessed by abdominal ultrasound or by magnetic resonance imaging. Mechanisms for interspecies variations in the pancreatic response to CCK among rodents, monkeys, and humans and their relevance to human risk are discussed.", 
    "1": "The Fourier Transform infrared and Fourier Transform Raman spectra of 7-chloro-5 (2-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (7C3D4B) were recorded in the regions 4000-400 and 4000-100 cm(-1), respectively. The appropriate theoretical spectrograms for the IR and Raman spectra of the title molecule were also constructed. The calculated results show that the predicted geometry can well reproduce the structural parameters. Predicted vibrational frequencies have been assigned and compared with experimental IR spectra and they supported each other. Stability of the molecule arising from hyperconjugative interactions, charge delocalization and intramolecular hydrogen bond-like weak interaction has been analyzed using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis by using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method. The results show that electron density (ED) in the \u03c3* and \u03c0* antibonding orbitals and second-order delocalization energies E(2) confirm the occurrence of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) within the molecule. The first order hyperpolarizability (\u03b2total) of this molecular system and related properties (\u03b2, \u03bc, and \u0394\u03b1) are calculated using HF/6-31G(d,p) and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) methods based on the finite-field approach.",

    "3": "We therefore recruited 60 schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine or other AAPs. We assessed the prevalence rates of OCD or OC symptoms and hypochondriasis or hypochondriac symptoms in the whole group of patients and in clozapine-treated patients versus patients treated with other AAPs.", 
    "4": "Schizophrenic patients had a higher comorbidity rate of OCD (26.6% vs 1-3%) and hypochondriasis (20% vs 1%) than the general population. These comorbidities were more frequent in schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine versus patients treated with other AAPs (36.7% vs 16.7% and 33.3% vs 6.7%). Clozapine-treated patients showed a higher mean Y-BOCS and HY-BOCS score when compared to patients treated with other AAPs (10.90 vs 5.90, p = .099; 15.40 vs 8.93, p = .166). A statistical significant correlation was found between the Y-BOCS and HY-BOCS scores of the whole group (r = .378, p = 0.03). Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation between the global level of functioning and the diagnosis of hypochondriasis (p = .048) and the severity of hypochondriac symptoms (p = .047).",

    "6": "Despite the adverse effects associated with marijuana abuse and dependence, marijuana is becoming more common-place in activities such as driving. Previous literature has discussed the high rates of cocaine, opioid and benzodiazepine use among users of marijuana, but no research has addressed the rates of concurrent use among drivers meeting abuse or dependence criteria. Each of these substances may produce effects detrimental to driving safety which may be compounded by concurrent substance use. This research examines rates of marijuana use, abuse, and dependence among an active sample of drivers (N = 7,734) in the 2007 National Roadside Survey. Mean age of participants was 36.89 years, and the majority were male (60.1%) and identified as White (59.2%). Participants who used marijuana but did not meet diagnostic criteria for abuse (n = 165) or dependence (n = 112) were significantly more likely to test positive for all substances than were those who did not use marijuana. Further, those that met criteria for marijuana abuse or dependence were more likely than those who did not meet criteria to test positive for THC, cocaine, and benzodiazepines and THC, cocaine, and opioids, respectively. The current research has implications for policy development and drugged driving interventions.", 
    "7": "Awareness and recall, though not common, are the major hazards of general anesthesia, especially in Cesarean section (C/S) because of the absence of benzodiazepine and opioids for a significant time during anesthesia. In this study, the Bispectral Index (BIS), end-tidal isoflurane, and hemodynamic parameters were examined to evaluate the depth of the routine general anesthetic technique in C/S.", 
    "8": "This study was carried out on 60 parturient patients undergoing elective C/S. A standardized anesthetic technique was applied: induction with Thiopental (4-5 mg/kg) and Succinylcholine (1.5-2 mg/kg) as well as maintenance with O2, N2O, and isoflurane. Electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood pressure, Spo2, end-tidal isoflurane concentration, BIS, and any clinical signs of inadequate depth of anesthesia such as movement, sweating, lacrimation, coughing, and jerking were continuously monitored and recorded at 16 fixed time points during anesthesia.", 
    "9": "A median BIS of less than 70 (range: 42-68) was obtained on all occasions during surgery; however, at each milestone, at least 20% of the patients had BIS values above 60. Hemodynamic parameters increased significantly in some patients, especially during laryngoscopy and intubation. No patient experienced recall or awareness.", 
    "10": "The currently used general anesthetic technique in our center appears inadequate in some milestones to reliably produce BIS values less than 60, which are associated with lower risk of awareness. Therefore, with respect to such desirable outcomes as good Apgar and clinical status in neonates, we would recommend the application of this method (if confirmed by further studies) through larger dosages of anesthetic agents.", 
    "11": "Molecular events that regulate cellular biosynthesis of steroid hormones have been a topic of intense research for more than half a century. It has been established that transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria forms the rate-limiting step in steroid hormone production. In current models, both the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and the translocator protein (TSPO) have been implicated to have a concerted and indispensable effort in this cholesterol transport. Deletion of StAR in mice resulted in a critical failure of steroid hormone production, but deletion of TSPO in mice was found to be embryonic lethal. As a result, the role of TSPO in cholesterol transport has been established only using pharmacologic and genetic tools in vitro. To allow us to explore in more detail the function of TSPO in cell type-specific experimental manipulations in vivo, we generated mice carrying TSPO floxed alleles (TSPOfl/fl). In this study we made conditional knockout mice (TSPOc\u0394/\u0394) with TSPO deletion in testicular Leydig cells by crossing with an anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type II cre/+ mouse line. Genetic ablation of TSPO in steroidogenic Leydig cells in mice did not affect testosterone production, gametogenesis, and reproduction. Expression of StAR, cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/\u03945-\u03944 isomerase type I, and TSPO2 in TSPOc\u0394/\u0394 testis was unaffected. These results challenge the prevailing dogma that claims an essential role for TSPO in steroid hormone biosynthesis and force reexamination of functional interpretations made for this protein. This is the first study examining conditional TSPO gene deletion in mice. The results show that TSPO function is not essential for steroid hormone biosynthesis.",

This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of the addition of olanzapine in adults experiencing refractory CINV stratified by chemotherapy emetogenicity.", 
    "13": "Thirty-three adults who experienced CINV refractory to guideline-recommended prophylaxis and breakthrough antiemetics (dopamine antagonists and benzodiazepines) and received at least one dose of olanzapine 5-10\u00a0mg per os were evaluated. Failure was defined as >5 emesis events in 24\u00a0h or more than 10 cumulative doses of rescue antiemetics following first olanzapine dose per treatment cycle. Post hoc analyses investigated variables impacting olanzapine efficacy.", 
    "14": "The addition of olanzapine demonstrated an overall success rate of 70\u00a0%. This success rate did not differ between chemotherapy regimens of high versus low-to-moderate emetogenicity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.79), prophylaxis with serotonin antagonist plus corticosteroid and aprepitant versus serotonin antagonist alone (p\u00a0=\u00a00.77), or age over 50 versus \u226450\u00a0years (p\u00a0>\u00a00.99). A trend toward greater benefit was seen in women (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08).", 
    "15": "The addition of olanzapine to a dopamine antagonist and benzodiazepine demonstrated high efficacy rates for refractory CINV irrespective of chemotherapy emetogenicity. The high success rates among all groups suggests that incomplete resolution of CINV with prophylactic serotonin antagonists and breakthrough dopamine antagonists plus benzodiazepine may benefit from the addition of olanzapine regardless of gender, degree of chemotherapy emetogenicity, number of prophylactic antiemetics, or age. The trend toward greater control of emesis in women merits further investigation.",

    "18": "Descriptive design was used. Thirty primary caregivers of cancer patients attending the palliative care clinic in Vellore, South India, were provided training on the administration of drugs for acute symptoms. A plastic box with partitions for drugs specific to symptom was provided. On follow-up visits, the usage of the kit, drugs used, and routes of administration were noted. A structured questionnaire with a 4-point scale was used to assess primary caregiver views and satisfaction.", 
    "19": "Of primary caregivers, 96.7% used a kit. The common medications used were morphine, metoclopramide, dexamethasone, and benzodiazepines. Seventy-three percent of primary caregivers administered subcutaneous injections at home. Hospital visits for acute symptoms reduced by 80%; 90% were satisfied with the training received; 73% stated it was not a burden to treat the patient at home.", 
    "20": "The training program and acute symptom management kit were favorably received and appropriately used by caregivers of diverse backgrounds. Rural backgrounds and illiteracy were not barriers to acceptance.",

    "23": "Numbers for redemptions of benzodiazepines and Z drugs in Norwegian pharmacies for the years 2004-2011 were collected from the Prescription Registry. Population figures were collected from Statistics Norway. Consumption was calculated by the number of DDDs (defined daily doses).", 
    "24": "Among those who were supplied with benzodiazepines or Z drugs, recipients of more than 2 DDDs per day (heavy users) accounted for a small group. We registered an extensive use of Z drugs among older women, many of whom were prescribed an amount corresponding to a regular daily use of 1-2 DDDs. The total prescription of alprazolam and nitrazepam/flunitrazepam was minor, but high dosages were not uncommon among those who were prescribed these drugs. Only a small proportion of the patients who were prescribed clonazepam received a reimbursable prescription. The prescribing of a number of benzodiazepines and Z drugs at the same time remains not uncommon.", 
    "25": "Prescribing of Z drugs to the elderly, and to women in particular, may indicate that many people in this group are regular users of sedative hypnotics, which is contrary to the guidelines. A considerable proportion of the prescriptions for clonazepam are outside of the approved indications. Among the users of the drugs studied, only a small fraction were heavy users, but since the use is widespread, this represents a considerable number of individuals.", 
    "26": "The related NUAK1 and NUAK2 are members of the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) family of protein kinases that are activated by the LKB1 (liver kinase B1) tumour suppressor kinase. Recent work suggests they play important roles in regulating key biological processes including Myc-driven tumorigenesis, senescence, cell adhesion and neuronal polarity. In the present paper we describe the first highly specific protein kinase inhibitors of NUAK kinases namely WZ4003 and HTH-01-015. WZ4003 inhibits both NUAK isoforms (IC50 for NUAK1 is 20 nM and for NUAK2 is 100 nM), whereas HTH-01-015 inhibits only NUAK1 (IC50 is 100 nM). These compounds display extreme selectivity and do not significantly inhibit the activity of 139 other kinases that were tested including ten AMPK family members. In all cell lines tested, WZ4003 and HTH-01-015 inhibit the phosphorylation of the only well-characterized substrate, MYPT1 (myosin phosphate-targeting subunit 1) that is phosphorylated by NUAK1 at Ser(445). We also identify a mutation (A195T) that does not affect basal NUAK1 activity, but renders it ~50-fold resistant to both WZ4003 and HTH-01-015. Consistent with NUAK1 mediating the phosphorylation of MYPT1 we find that in cells overexpressing drug-resistant NUAK1[A195T], but not wild-type NUAK1, phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Ser(445) is no longer suppressed by WZ4003 or HTH-01-015. We also demonstrate that administration of WZ4003 and HTH-01-015 to MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) significantly inhibits migration in a wound-healing assay to a similar extent as NUAK1-knockout. WZ4003 and HTH-01-015 also inhibit proliferation of MEFs to the same extent as NUAK1 knockout and U2OS cells to the same extent as NUAK1 shRNA knockdown. We find that WZ4003 and HTH-01-015 impaired the invasive potential of U2OS cells in a 3D cell invasion assay to the same extent as NUAK1 knockdown. The results of the present study indicate that WZ4003 and HTH-01-015 will serve as useful chemical probes to delineate the biological roles of the NUAK kinases.", 
    "27": "Euthanasia of stranded large whales poses logistic, safety, pharmaceutical, delivery, public relations, and disposal challenges. Reasonable arguments may be made for allowing a stranded whale to expire naturally. However, slow cardiovascular collapse from gravitational effects outside of neutral buoyancy, often combined with severely debilitating conditions, motivate humane efforts to end the animal's suffering. The size of the animal and prevailing environmental conditions often pose safety concerns for stranding personnel, which take priority over other considerations. When considering chemical euthanasia, the size of the animal also necessitates large quantities of euthanasia agents. Drug residues are a concern for relay toxicity to scavengers, particularly for pentobarbital-containing euthanasia solutions. Pentobarbital is also an environmental concern because of its stability and long persistence in aquatic environments. We describe a euthanasia technique for stranded mysticetes using readily available, relatively inexpensive, preanesthetic and anesthetic drugs (midazolam, acepromazine, xylazine) followed by saturated KCl delivered via custom-made needles and a low-cost, basic, pressurized canister. This method provides effective euthanasia while moderating personnel exposure to hazardous situations and minimizing drug residues of concern for relay toxicity.",

It has been considered for a long time as a subtype of schizophrenia, even though this association occurs only in 10% of cases. In contrast, it is frequently observed in bipolar patients. First-line treatment consists of benzodiazepines, while in case of resistance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and clozapine have shown positive results. In addition, recent studies reported the efficacy of some atypical antipsychotics.

Automated dissolution test equipment captured ODT dissolution rates by measuring real-time release of active ingredient. A high-speed video camera was used to capture tablet disintegration times in warm simulated saliva.",

    "34": "The ODT manufacturing method was associated with time to disintegrate; the fastest were freeze dried tablets, followed by soft compressed tablets and then hard/dense tablets. Olanzapine Zydis(\u00ae) was the only ODT that completely disintegrated in less than 4 s for all strengths (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg), followed by 5-mg Prolanz FAST(\u00ae) (12 s) and then risperidone ODT 4 mg (40 s). Reasons for slow dissolution of the olanzapine generics may include low product potency, excipient binding, excipient solubility, active ingredient particle size and incomplete disintegration.",

    "36": "The role of the 18-kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) in cell death induced by NH4Cl (1-50 mM) for 24-72 hours to human glioblastoma U118MG cells was investigated. Cell death was already observed after 48 hours of treatment with NH4Cl at 5 mM. Dose and time-responses curves indicated that 15 mM of NH4Cl applied for 72 hours was the optimal condition for our viability assays. For example, 72 hours of 15 mM of NH4Cl caused a 50.3% increase in propidium iodide uptake, and lactate dehydrogenase release was 41.2% of the positive control, indicating significant increases in cell death. Furthermore, compared to vehicle control, these experimental conditions resulted in a significant decrease of 44.9% of the mitochondrial activity, a 62.3% increase in incidence of collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase of 49.0% of cardiolipin peroxidation. In addition, a significant 4.3 fold increase in the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of TSPO was found in NH4Cl-exposed cells. Surprisingly, western blot analysis and real-time PCR did not demonstrate changes in TSPO expression. We also found that neither NH4Cl nor glutamine (a metabolic product of enhanced NH4Cl levels) inhibited binding of the TSPO ligand [(3)H]PK 11195. Interestingly, we observed a bimodal effect of the TSPO ligands PK 11195, Ro5-4864, and FGIN-1-27 on the toxicity of NH4Cl; such that 1-100 nM concentrations of TSPO ligands were protective, while concentrations above 1 \u03bcM enhanced NH4Cl-induced cell death processes. In conclusion, TSPO takes part in a bimodal way in the lethal effects induced by NH4Cl in glial type cells.", 
    "37": "Traumatic brain injuries represent the leading cause of death and morbidity in young adults in western countries, and are responsible for a major social and economical burden. For decades, the mainstay of neurotrauma management has been represented by control of post-traumatic edema. With the emergence of a better understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of secondary brain damage, the hope for the \"magic bullet\" has prompted the development of novel drugs that have repeatedly failed to significantly improve outcome of head-injured patients. During the past decade, mitochondrial functional and structural impairment has emerged as a pivotal event in the pathway of cell to secondary death. Extensive research has identified a vast range of deleterious signals that are generated and integrated at the mitochondrial level resulting in impairment of major mitochondrial functions such as calcium homeostasis, free radicals generation and detoxification, energy production and neurosteroidogenesis. Mitochondria have therefore emerged as a potential therapeutic target. Within the spectrum of major mitochondrial structural components, the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has shown important and relevant functions such as steroid synthesis and modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition that may substantially affect the fate of injured cells. This review summarizes the potential therapeutic implications of TSPO modulation in traumatic brain injury in the view of the current knowledge on this intriguing mitochondrial complex.", 
    "38": "The effect of etravirine on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and P-glycoprotein were evaluated in two randomized, crossover trials in healthy subjects. A modified Cooperstown 5\u2009+\u20091 cocktail was utilized to determine the effects of etravirine on single-dose pharmacokinetics of model CYP probes. The cocktail was administered alone, then, after a 14-day washout, etravirine 200\u2009mg twice daily (bid) was given for 14 days with cocktail on days 1 and 14. In a separate study, digoxin (0.5\u2009mg) was administered alone, then, after a 14-day washout, etravirine 200\u2009mg bid was administered for 12 days with digoxin on day 8. In the cocktail study, the AUClast least squares mean (LSM) ratios (90% confidence intervals [CIs]) for cocktail\u2009+\u2009etravirine versus cocktail were 0.93 (0.88, 0.99; paraxanthine), 0.58 (0.44, 0.75; 7-OH-S-warfarin), 0.43 (0.20, 0.96; 5-OH-omeprazole), 0.85 (0.78, 0.94; dextrorphan), and 0.69 (0.64, 0.74; midazolam). Digoxin AUC0-8h was slightly increased with etravirine coadministration (LSM ratio 1.18 [0.90, 1.56]). These data suggest that etravirine is a weak CYP3A isozyme inducer and minimally inhibits CYP2C9, 2C19, and P-glycoprotein activity.",

Catatonia is a syndrome linked to frontal dysfunction that most frequently occurs in patients with mood disorders. The diagnostic criteria of catatonia and frontotemporal dementia partly overlap. In the present patients, catatonia might be closely related to frontal dysfunction caused by frontotemporal lobe atrophy. With regard to therapeutics for catatonia, we found that administering a low dose of lorazepam alone or after electroconvulsive therapy may be useful for treating and preventing catatonia. We also found that administering glutaminate antagonists such as memantine may be useful for treating lorazepam-resistant catatonia.",

Wistar rats were subjected to the defensive burying test, elevated plus maze, and open field test. In different groups, three GABA(A) receptor antagonists were administered 30 min before FAT-M administration, including the competitive GABA binding antagonist bicuculline (1 mg/kg), GABA(A) benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (5 mg/kg), and noncompetitive GABA(A) chloride channel antagonist picrotoxin (1 mg/kg). The FAT-M exerted anxiolytic-like effects in the defensive burying test and elevated plus maze, without affecting locomotor activity in the open field test. The GABA(A) antagonists alone did not produce significant changes in the behavioral tests. Picrotoxin but not bicuculline or flumazenil blocked the anxiolytic-like effect of the FAT-M. Based on the specific blocking action of picrotoxin on the effects of the FAT-M, we conclude that the FAT-M exerted its anxiolytic-like effects through GABA(A) receptor chloride channels.",

The studies indicated that cis-olefin compounds induce higher cytotoxicity with increase in the G1 cell cycle phase compared with the trans-compounds. Quantitative RT-PCR assay indicated that compounds (16a-d) induced G1 phase arrest through down-regulation of cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p21, p27, and p53 mRNA expressions. Compounds 16a-d induced A375 early apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry after double-staining with annexin V and propidium iodide. Moreover, the Western blot analysis showed that A375 treated by compounds (16a-d) resulted in decreased levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, increased levels of Bax and Bad, and caspase/PARP degradation to identify apoptotic cells.", 
    "46": "Polo-like kinases (Plks) are a family of serine/threonine kinases with a highly conserved N-terminal Ser/Thr kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal region that play crucial roles in cell cycle progression. Plk1, playing a key role in multiple steps of mitotic progression, is the most studied member of the family. It is overexpressed in a wide spectrum of cancer types and is a promising target in oncology. Most of Plk1 inhibitors competitively bind to the ATP-binding site, which is characterized with unique features. Other inhibitors target regions outside the ATP pocket. In this review some pre-clinical or clinical Plk1 inhibitors are reported, focusing on SAR studies and biological activities, including the kinase activity, in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy. Those studies exhibited the inhibitors' significant therapeutic effects. Moreover, combination therapies of these Plk1 inhibitors with other anticancer drugs resulted with synergistic effects.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of depression among patients on hemodialysis. We conducted an observational cross-sectional study at two hemodialysis centres in the metropolitan area of Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, Brazil, between September and October 2010. The occurrence of depression was evaluated according to Beck Depression Inventory II. Among 148 patients interviewed, the mean age was 46 \u00b1 13 years and 54% were male. The average time on dialysis was 5.3 \u00b1 5.2 years. Depression was found in 101 (68.2%) cases. Depression was classified as mild (49.5%), moderate (41.5%) and severe (9%). Only 15.5% had prior depression diagnosis. Follow-up with Psychologist was being done in only 32.4% of cases. Patients with depression had a higher frequency of antidepressant use (20.7% vs. 4.2%, p=.01) and benzodiazepines (33.6% vs. 8.5%, p=.001). Among patients using antidepressant, improvement of symptoms was reported by 81.6%. Depression is one potentially modifiable risk factor in ESRD.

We herein discuss the synthesis, molecular modeling and in vitro studies for the newly developed ligands. Compounds 5c and 5h behaved as BACE1 inhibitors on the isolated enzyme and in cellular studies. Particularly, for its low molecular weight, inhibitor 5h is a prototypic hit to develop a series of BACE1 inhibitors more potent and active on whole-cells.", 
    "50": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent of the thiobenzodiazepine class. It blocks multiple neurotransmitter receptors including dopaminergic at D1, D2, D3, D4 brain receptors, serotonergic at 5-HT2a, 5-HT2c, 5-HT3, 5-HT6 receptors, catecholamines at alpha1 adrenergic receptors, acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, and histamine at H1 receptors. Olanzapine has five times the affinity for 5-HT2 receptors than D2 receptors and has been used to treat schizophrenia and delirium. Olanzapine's activity at multiple receptors, particularly at the D2, 5-HT2c, and 5-HT3 receptors which appear to be involved in nausea and emesis, has prompted its use in the treatment of nausea and vomiting refractory to standard antiemetics. Case reports and formal clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of chronic nausea, the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis, and the treatment of breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis. Phase II and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that there is a significant improvement in nausea when olanzapine is added to guideline directed prophylactic antiemetic agents 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists in patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy Common side effects of olanzapine when used over a period of months include weight gain as well as an association with the onset of diabetes mellitus, but these effects have not been seen with short term use of daily doses of less than one week.", 
    "51": "As a specific variation of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV) appears particularly linked to psychological processes. The three predominant factors related to ANV are classical conditioning; demographic and treatment-related factors; and anxiety or negative expectancies. Laboratory models have provided some support for these underlying mechanisms for ANV. ANV may be treated with medical or pharmacological interventions, including benzodiazepines and other psychotropic medications. However, behavioral treatments, including systematic desensitization, remain first line options for addressing ANV. Some complementary treatment approaches have shown promise in reducing ANV symptoms. Additional research into these approaches is needed. This review will address the underlying models of ANV and provide a discussion of these various treatment options.",

To map GABAergic mechanisms associated with processing affect, we used a benzodiazepine challenge while subjects viewed salient visual stimuli. Fourteen stable, medicated schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients and 13 healthy comparison subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) technique while they viewed salient emotional images. Subjects received intravenous lorazepam (LRZ; 0.01 mg/kg) or saline in a single-blinded, cross-over design (two sessions separated by 1-3 weeks). A predicted group by drug interaction was noted in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) as well as right superior frontal gyrus and left and right occipital regions, such that psychosis patients showed an increased BOLD signal to LRZ challenge, rather than the decreased signal exhibited by the comparison group. A main effect of reduced BOLD signal in bilateral occipital areas was noted across groups. Consistent with the role of the dmPFC in processing emotion, state negative affect positively correlated with the response to the LRZ challenge in the dmPFC for the patients and comparison subjects. The altered response to LRZ challenge is consistent with altered inhibition predicted by postmortem findings of altered GABAR in schizophrenia. These results also suggest that negative affect in schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder is associated-directly or indirectly-with GABAergic function on a continuum with normal behavior.",

    "64": "Alterations in excitatory-inhibitory balance occur in Down syndrome and could be responsible for cognitive deficits observed through the life of all individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21. Excess of inhibition in the adult could produce synaptic plasticity deficits that may be a primary mechanism contributing to learning and memory impairments. In this study we discuss pharmacological treatments that could potentially alleviate neuronal inhibition and have been tested in a mouse model of Down syndrome. \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature central nervous system that binds to GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, opens a chloride channel and reduces neuronal excitability. These receptors have been extensively studied as targets for treatment of epilepsy, anxiety, sleep, cognitive disorders and the induction of sedation. Molecules that are either antagonists or inverse agonists of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptors are able to reduce inhibitory GABAergic transmission. However modulating the excitatory-inhibitory balance towards increase of cognition without inducing seizures remains difficult particularly when using GABA antagonists. In this study we review data from the literature obtained using inverse agonists selective for the \u03b15-subunit containing receptor. Such inverse agonists, initially developed as cognitive enhancers for treatment of memory impairments, proved to be very efficient in reversing learning and memory deficits in a Down syndrome mouse model after acute treatment.",

Following administration of midazolam, the patient's clinical condition and EEG improved. We review the 8 documented cases of ifosfamide-induced NCSE, and demonstrate the similarity in clinical features when compared with ifosfamide neurotoxicity that is not classified as NCSE. EEG findings suggesting an ictal pattern are subtle and heterogeneous, but they are essential for a diagnosis. Since it is unlikely that EEGs are uniformly obtained in instances of ifosfamide neurotoxicity, many cases of NCSE may go unrecognized.",

Since sunitinib is metabolized by cytochrome P450(CYP)3A4, variability in the activity of this enzyme may explain a considerable proportion of this inter-patient variability. Midazolam is widely used as a phenotyping probe to assess CYP3A4-activity. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between midazolam and sunitinib exposure. Additionally, the correlation between sunitinib trough levels and exposure and the influence of sunitinib on midazolam exposure was determined.",

Consequently, midazolam could be used to identify patients that are at risk of under- or overtreatment, respectively, at the start of sunitinib therapy. Moreover, sunitinib and sunitinib + SU12662 trough levels are highly correlated with drug exposure and can thus be used in clinical practice to individualize sunitinib therapy. The decrease in midazolam exposure by sunitinib needs further investigation.", 
    "70": "Organophosphate-induced brain damage is an irreversible neuronal injury, likely because there is no pharmacological treatment to prevent or block secondary damage processes. The presence of free glutamate (Glu) in the brain has a substantial role in the propagation and maintenance of organophosphate-induced seizures, thus contributing to the secondary brain damage. This report describes for the first time the ability of blood glutamate scavengers (BGS) oxaloacetic acid in combination with glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase to reduce the neuronal damage in an animal model of paraoxon (PO) intoxication. Our method causes a rapid decrease of blood Glu levels and creates a gradient that leads to the efflux of the excess brain Glu into the blood, thus reducing neurotoxicity. We demonstrated that BGS treatment significantly prevented the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) density elevation, after PO exposure. Furthermore, we showed that BGS was able to rescue neurons in the piriform cortex of the treated rats. In conclusion, these results suggest that treatment with BGS has a neuroprotective effect in the PO intoxication. This is the first time that this approach is used in PO intoxication and it may be of high clinical significance for the future treatment of the secondary neurologic damage post organophosphates exposure.",

However, it is still unclear how OT activates VTA and related midline nucleus. Here, using patch-clamp recording, we studied the effects of OT on neuron activity in VTA and interfascicular nucleus (IF). OT dose-dependently and selectively excited small neurons located in medial VTA and the majority of IF neurons but not large neurons in lateral VTA. We found the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) and the membrane capacitance of OT-sensitive neuron were significantly smaller than those of OT-insensitive neurons. The action potential width of OT-sensitive neurons was about half that of OT-insensitive neurons. The OT effect was blocked by the OT receptor antagonist atosiban and WAY-267464 but not by tetrodotoxin, suggesting a direct postsynaptic activation of OT receptors. In addition, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 antagonized the depolarization by OT. Both the nonselective cation channel (NSCC) antagonist SKF96365 and the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) blocker SN-6 attenuated OT effects. These results suggested that the PLC signaling pathway coupling to NSCC and NCX contributes to the OT-mediated activation of neurons in medial VTA and IF. Taken together, our results indicate OT directly acted on medial VTA and especially IF neurons to activate NSCC and NCX via PLC. The direct activation by OT of midbrain neurons may be one mechanism underlying OT effects on social behavior.",

This was achieved utilising a previously unreported oxidation peak. The origin of this peak was investigated further by cyclic voltammetry and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. At pH 6 the voltammetric behaviour of this oxidation process was found to involve adsorption of the drug allowing for the development of an adsorptive stripping voltammetric assay. Experimental conditions were then optimised for the determination of diazepam in a beverage sample using a medium exchange technique. It was shown that no elaborate extraction procedures were required as the calibration plots obtained in the absence and presence of the beverage were very similar.",

    "90": "The Italian League Against Epilepsy Commission Guidelines Subcommittee on Status Epilepticus (SE) has published an article on the management of SE in adults, and now presents a report on the management of convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) in children, excluding the neonatal period. Children's greater susceptibility than adults to epileptic seizures results from many factors. Earlier maturation of excitatory than inhibitory synapses, increased susceptibility and concentration of receptors for excitatory neurotransmitters, peculiar composition of the receptor subunits resulting in slower and less effective inhibitory responses, all cause the high incidence of SE in the pediatric population. The related morbidity and mortality rates, although lower than in adults, require immediate diagnosis and therapy. The division into focal and generalized, nonconvulsive and convulsive SE is applied in children and adolescents, as is the distinction in the three different stages according to the time elapsed since the start of the event and the response to drugs (initial, defined, and refractory SE). In children and adolescents, an \"operational definition\" is also accepted to allow earlier treatment (starting at 5-10 min). Maintenance and stabilization of vital functions, cessation of convulsions, diagnosis, and initial treatment of potentially \"life-threatening\" causes are the objectives to be pursued in the management of children with CSE. The need for early pharmacologic intervention stresses the need for action in the prehospital setting, generally using rectal diazepam. In hospital, parenteral benzodiazepines are used (lorazepam, diazepam, or midazolam). When first-line drugs fail, sodium phenytoin and phenobarbital should be used. As alternatives to phenobarbital, the following can be considered for treatment of refractory CSE: valproate, levetiracetam, and lacosamide. In cases with refractory CSE, pharmacologic options can be thiopental, midazolam, or propofol in continuous intravenous infusions to suppress electroencephalographic bursts and convulsive activity. These drugs need to be administered in intensive care units to ensure the monitoring and support of vital signs and brain electrical activity.", 
    "91": "The histaminergic involvement in selective processes underlying its role in human sensori-motor performance is largely unknown. Recently, selective effects of central H\u2081-inverse agonism on sensory visual processes were observed in electrophysiological--but not behavioral data; a discrepancy suggested to result from speeded response-choice related processes. This study attempts to establish the effects on visual processes and identify putative compensatory mechanisms related to increased visual and response-choice task demands by assessing H\u2081-inverse agonism induced changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response. Twelve participants received oral doses of dexchlorpheniramine 4 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, and placebo in a three-way crossover designed study. Brain activity was assessed for choice reaction time task performance in a 3 T magnetic resonance scanner 2 h after drug administration. Participants responded with their left or right hand and index or middle finger as indicated by the laterality of stimulus presentation and identity of the stimulus, respectively. Stimuli were intact or visually degraded and responses were compatible or incompatible with the laterality of stimulus presentation. Both dexchlorpheniramine and lorazepam affected the BOLD response in the occipital cortex indicating affected visual information processing. Dexchlorpheniramine decreased BOLD response in the dorsal precuneus and left precentral gyrus as part of a motor network, which however might not be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism, but may be the upstream consequence of impaired visual processing.",

    "97": "Numerous studies have reported that the hippocampus in schizophrenia patients is reduced in volume compared to the normal population. Antipsychotic medications have had mixed benefits in maintaining hippocampal volume or reversing volume loss. Recent evidence indicates that routine aerobic exercise represents a promising intervention for reversing hippocampal loss and cognitive deficits. In the present study, we measured the effects of chronic treatment with olanzapine and daily exercise on the hippocampal volumes of rats. Adult female rats were treated during the week with either olanzapine (10mg/kg) or vehicle for 9 consecutive weeks. Subgroups of animals were provided access to exercise running wheels for 1 or 3h per day during the same period, or were sedentary. Metabolic indices, including glucose tolerance, were measured on a weekly basis. At the conclusion of the study, brains were perfused and hippocampal sections were Nissl stained. Total hippocampal volume was measured using the Cavalieri estimator. Treatment with olanzapine caused a significant decrease in hippocampal volume in sedentary rats. However, exercise was able to reverse most of this volume loss. The hippocampal sub-regions of the dentate gyrus and CA1 were most strongly affected by olanzapine and exercise. Of interest, there was a strong and highly significant negative correlation between glucose intolerance and hippocampal volume, whereby greater glucose intolerance was associated with a smaller hippocampal volume. These findings indicate that exercise may have beneficial effects on the hippocampus when antipsychotic medication can contribute to changes in volume.", 
    "98": "The oral pontine reticular formation (PnO) of rat is one region identified in the brainstem as a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep induction zone. Microinjection of GABA(A) receptor antagonists into PnO induces a long lasting increase in REM sleep, which is similar to that produced by cholinergic agonists. We previously showed that this REM sleep-induction can be completely blocked by a muscarinic antagonist, indicating that the REM sleep-inducing effect of GABA(A) receptor antagonism is dependent upon the local cholinergic system. Consistent with these findings, it has been reported that GABA(A) receptor antagonists microdialyzed into PnO resulted in increased levels of acetylcholine. We hypothesize that GABA(A) receptors located on cholinergic boutons in the PnO are responsible for the REM sleep induction by GABA(A) receptor antagonists through blocking GABA inhibition of acetylcholine release. Cholinergic, varicose axon fibers were studied in the PnO by immunofluorescence and confocal, laser scanning microscopy. Immunoreactive cholinergic boutons were found to be colocalized with GABA(A) receptor subunit protein \u03b32. This finding implicates a specific subtype and location of GABA(A) receptors in PnO of rat in the control of REM sleep.", 
    "99": "Second generation antipsychotic drugs are routinely used as treatment for psychotic disorders. Many of these compounds, including olanzapine, cause metabolic side-effects such as impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Individual antidiabetic drugs can help control elevated glucose levels in patients treated with antipsychotics, but the effects of combining antidiabetics, which routinely occurs with Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, have never been studied. Presently, we compared the effects of the three different antidiabetics metformin (500mg/kg, p.o.), rosiglitazone (30mg/kg, p.o.) and glyburide (10mg/kg, p.o.) on metabolic dysregulation in adult female rats treated acutely with olanzapine. In addition, dual combinations of each of these antidiabetics were compared head-to-head against each other and the individual drugs. The animals received two daily treatments with antidiabetics and were then treated acutely with olanzapine (10mg/kg, i.p.). Fasting glucose and insulin levels were measured, followed by a 2h glucose tolerance test. Olanzapine caused a large and highly significant glucose intolerance compared to vehicle treated rats. Rosiglitazone decreased glucose levels non-significantly, while both metformin and glyburide significantly decreased glucose levels compared to olanzapine-only treated animals. For antidiabetic dual-drug combinations, the rosiglitazone-metformin group showed an unexpected increase in glucose levels compared to all of the single antidiabetic drugs. However, both the metformin-glyburide and rosiglitazone-glyburide groups showed significantly greater reductions in glucose levels following olanzapine than with single drug treatment alone for metformin or rosiglitazone, bringing glucose levels down to values equivalent to vehicle-only treated animals. These findings indicate that further study of antidiabetic dual-drug combinations in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs is warranted.", 
    "100": "This preclinical study investigated how a short-term risperidone treatment in adolescence impacts antipsychotic response to olanzapine and clozapine in adulthood. Antipsychotic effect was indexed by a drug's suppressive effect on avoidance responding in a rat conditioned avoidance response (CAR) model. Male adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats were first treated with risperidone (1.0mg/kg, sc) or sterile water and tested in the CAR model for 5 consecutive days from postnatal days P 40 to 44. After they became adults (~P 80-84), they were switched to olanzapine (0.5mg/kg, sc), clozapine (5.0mg/kg, sc) or vehicle treatment and tested for avoidance for 5days. During the adolescent period, repeated risperidone treatment produced a persistent inhibition of avoidance response. Throughout the 5days of adulthood drug testing, rats previously treated with risperidone in adolescence made significantly fewer avoidance responses than the vehicle ones when they all were switched to olanzapine, indicating a risperidone-induced enhancement of behavioral sensitivity to olanzapine. In contrast, when switched to clozapine, rats previously treated with risperidone made significantly more avoidance responses than the vehicle rats, indicating a risperidone-induced decrease of behavioral sensitivity to clozapine. Performance in the prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response in adulthood was not altered by adolescent risperidone treatment. Collectively, adolescent risperidone exposure induced a long-term change in behavioral sensitivity to other atypical antipsychotic drugs, with the specific direction of change (i.e., increase or decrease) dependent on the drug to be switched to. These long-lasting changes are likely mediated by drug-induced neuroplastic changes and may also have significant clinical implications for antipsychotic treatment of chronic patients with an early onset of psychotic symptoms.", 
    "101": "Illicit use of methadone and buprenorphine has been described as a growing problem in Sweden in recent years, and has been associated with an increased drug-related mortality. Critics claim that the substances have become popular among adolescents and that they function as a gateway to heroin use.

Among young drug users in general, few have tried the substances, and there is nothing to indicate that they act as gateway drugs. Among adolescents and young adults with severe drug problems, however, the illicit use of methadone and buprenorphine is more common (54% in a compulsory care sample). These substances normally enter the drug career late, and few use them as their main drug of choice. Other prescription drugs, like benzodiazepines and tramadol, are used by adolescents to a far greater extent. Diversion and illicit use of methadone and buprenorphine is not seen as a serious problem by the professionals interviewed. A general view is that the substances are mainly used by people with a heroin or polydrug addiction, often for \"self-medication\" purposes. However, several informants express concern that methadone and buprenorphine may cause fatalities among young drug users without an opioid tolerance.", 
    "104": "Illicit use of methadone and buprenorphine among young drug users is not a widespread problem in Sweden. Harm-reduction measures should target drug users with more severe problems, among whom illicit use of methadone and buprenorphine is more common and pose a medical risk. Illicit use of other prescription drugs, which are less controlled and more widely used by young people, is an important issue for further research.",

The protective effects of clonazepam and midazolam were observed at high (1 TD50, incoordination) and medium (0.3 TD50) doses and the effects of phenazepam and diazepam were found only at high doses. Midazolam produced the most pronounced protective effect: administration of this drug significantly increased the protective index of atropine+HI-6 combination during poisoning.", 
    "106": "We studied the effects of phenazepam (0.075 mg/kg) after pretreatment (5 minutes before) with naloxone (10 mg/kg) on open-field behavior of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. In ex vivo experiments, we studied the effects of naloxone (1 and 10 mg/kg) on receptor binding of [(3)H]-flunitrazepam by membranes of brain fraction (P1+P2) of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. It was shown that naloxone increased motor activity in the open field in BALB/c mice and decreased this parameter in C57Bl/6 mice. During combined treatment, naloxone potentiated the activating effects of phenazepam on the open-field behavior of BALB/c mice and slightly increased the sedative effect of this drug in C57Bl/6 mice. Naloxone stimulated reception of [(3)H]-flunitrazepam in BALB/c mice and slightly increased radioligand binding in C57Bl/6 mice. These data attest to enhanced reception in benzodiazepine site of GABAA-receptor under conditions of opioid receptor blockade, the presence of anxiolytic or sedative (depending on the phenotype of the response to emotional stress) effect of naloxone, and co-directed effects of naloxone and benzodiazepine tranquilizer on open-field behavior of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice.",

An ROI-driven analysis (regions of interest) was conducted, using 18 clusters from a previous arterial spin labeling study demonstrating greater regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in these cLBP subjects than the PFCs. Cortical thickness and VBM-based gray matter volume measurements were obtained from a structural MRI scan and group contrasts were calculated.",

These clusters were non-significant after including age as a covariate (P<0.891; P<0.279). A whole-brain cortical thickness and VBM analysis also did not identify significant clusters of thinning or thickening. Exploratory analyses identified group differences for correlations between age and cortical thickness of the right rostral middle frontal gyrus (cLBP: R=-0.03, P=0.9; PFCs: R=-0.81, P<0.001), that is, PFCs demonstrated age-related thinning while cLBP patients did not.",

The aim of the present study was to provide preliminary characteristics of zolpidem-induced catalepsy in Wistar rats. Zolpidem (2.5-10.0mg/kg), but not diazepam and midazolam, produced dose-dependent cataleptic responses in the bar test, which were similar to those produced by a reference antipsychotic drug, haloperidol. Zolpidem-induced catalepsy was abolished by a benzodiazepine site antagonist, flumazenil (5.0mg/kg), D2/3 receptor agonist, quinpirole (1.0mg/kg), and a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.1mg/kg), but not by a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (3.0mg/kg).

    "116": "Scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist has widespread central nervous system effects. Muscarinic receptors located in the central nervous system play a vital role in the modulation of impulsivity. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of scopolamine on impulsivity using differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-s schedule (DRL-72s) and to demonstrate the involvement of serotonergic receptors in mediating the effect of olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic) on scopolamine induced impulsivity. Scopolamine impaired the performance of the rats trained under DRL-72s schedule. Olanzapine reversed the deficits induced by scopolamine. We evaluated the effect of donepezil (cholinesterase inhibitor), SB-742457 (5-HT6 and 5-HT2a antagonist), and haloperidol (typical antipsychotic) in rats challenged with scopolamine in the DRL-72s schedule to identify the receptor(s) involved in reversing the deficits. SB-742457 partially reversed the deficits, but donepezil and haloperidol did not show any effects on the deficits induced by scopolamine. Olanzapine and SB-742457 shifted the peak location (PkL) towards longer IRT duration, indicating a decrease in motor impulsivity. Modulation of scopolamine-induced impulsivity by olanzapine could be partly due to its antagonistic action at 5-HT2a and 5-HT6 receptors, respectively. Superior effects of olanzapine on impulsivity in schizophrenic patients may be mediated through the antagonism of 5-HT2a and 5-HT6 receptors.",

We have already shown that olanzapine induces hepatic glucose production through the activation of hypothalamic adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, it is unclear how olanzapine activates hypothalamic AMPK. Since olanzapine is known to antagonize several receptors, including histaminergic, muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors, we examined the effect of each receptor antagonist on blood glucose levels in mice. Moreover, we also investigated whether these antagonists activate hypothalamic AMPK.",

    "133": "Falls are frequent in the elderly and affect mortality, morbidity, loss of functional capacity and institutionalization. In the older patient the incidence of falls can sometimes be underestimated, even in the absence of a clear cognitive impairment, because it is often difficult to reconstruct the dynamics. It is quite common that forms due to syncope are associated with retrograde amnesia and in 40 to 60% of the cases falls happen in the absence of witnesses. The pathogenesis of falls is often multifactorial, due to physiological age-related changes or more properly pathological factors, or due to the environment. The identification of risk factors is essential in the planning of preventive measures. Syncope is one of major causes of falls. About 20% of cardiovascular syncope in patients older than 70 appears as a fall and more than 20% of older people with Carotid Sinus Syndrome complain of falls as well as syncope. These data clearly state that older patients with history of falls should undergo a cardiovascular and neuroautonomic assessment besides the survey of other risk factors. Multifactorial assessment requires a synergy of various specialists. The geriatrician coordinates the multidisciplinary intervention in order to make the most effective evaluation of the risk of falling, searching for all predisposing factors, aiming towards a program of prevention. In clear pathological conditions it is possible to enact a specific treatment. Particular attention must indeed be paid to the re-evaluation of drug therapy, with dose adjustments or withdrawal especially for antihypertensive, diuretics and benzodiazepines. The Guidelines of the American Geriatrics Society recommend modification of environmental hazards, training paths, hip protectors and appropriate use of support tools (sticks, walkers), which can be effective elements of a multifactorial intervention program. Balance exercises are also recommended. In conclusion, an initial assessment, supported by a comprehensive cardiovascular and neuroautonomic evaluation, allows for reaching a final diagnosis in most cases, demonstrating a key role in the real identification of the etiology of the fall and implementing the treatment measures.",

The panel finds the following: 1. A complete autopsy is necessary for optimal interpretation of toxicology results, which must also be considered in the context of the circumstances surrounding death, medical history, and scene findings. 2. A complete scene investigation extends to reconciliation of prescription information and pill counts. 3. Blood, urine, and vitreous humor, when available, should be retained in all cases. Blood from the femoral vein is preferable to blood from other sites. 4. A toxicological panel should be comprehensive and include opioid and benzodiazepine analytes, as well as other potent depressant, stimulant, and anti-depressant medications. 5. Interpretation of postmortem opioid concentrations requires correlation with medical history, scene investigation, and autopsy findings. 6. If death is attributed to any drug or combination of drugs (whether as cause or contributing factor), the certifier should list all the responsible substances by generic name in the autopsy report and on the death certificate. 7. The best classification for manner of death in deaths due to the misuse or abuse of opioids without any apparent intent of self-harm is \"accident.\" Reserve \"undetermined\" as the manner for the rare cases in which evidence exists to support more than one possible determination.",

In the present study, the oxidative pathways of deoxyschizandrin (DS), the most abundant lignan in Fructus Schisandrae fruit extract, were characterized with liver microsomes from human (HLM) and rat (RLM). Only one monohydroxylated metabolite 7(S)-hydroxylated metabolite (isoschizandrin, ISZ), was identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were found to be the major isoforms involved in the monohydroxylation of DS. Also, the kinetic studies showed that DS hydroxylation obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics both in HLM and in RLM. However, the subsequent metabolism of ISZ was nearly nonexistent when DS was present. More importantly, the interactions between DS and three well characterized CYP3A probe substrates, testosterone (TST), midazolam (MDZ), and nifedipine (NIF), were studied. TST and MDZ were shown to compete with DS for the mutual binding site, causing Km to be increased. The presence of DS also lowered the binding affinities for MDZ and TST. However, DS showed only slight inhibitory effects on nifedipine (NIF) oxidation even though NIF was able to inhibit DS hydroxylation in a noncompetitive fashion. These results show that DS is a good representative substrate of MDZ and TST primarily due to their shared, large binding regions on CYP3A. Therefore, DS is an attractive candidate as a novel CYP3A probe substrate for predicting the metabolic modifications in CYP3A activity.",

Trials were classified into the following groups. 1. Atypical antipsychotics versus placebo: Only two studies compared one atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo. In one study, the number of non-responders treated with olanzapine was not different from the number treated with placebo (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.10); however, significantly more (57% vs 32%) people left the study early (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87) from the placebo group compared with the olanzapine group. With regard to adverse effects, young people treated with aripiprazole had significantly lower serum cholesterol compared with those given placebo (1 RCT, n = 302, RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.58). 2. Atypical antipsychotics versus typical antipsychotics: When the findings of all five trials comparing atypical antipsychotic medications with a typical antipsychotic medication were collated, no difference in the mean end point Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was noted between the two arms (5 RCTs, n = 236, MD -1.08, 95% CI -3.08 to 0.93). With regard to adverse effects, the mean end point serum prolactin concentration was much higher than the reference range for treatment with risperidone, olanzapine and molindone in one of the studies. However, fewer adolescents who were receiving atypical antipsychotic medications left the study because of adverse effects (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15) or for any reason (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97).3. One atypical antipsychotic versus another atypical antipsychotic: The mean end point BPRS score was not significantly different for people who received risperidone compared with those who received olanzapine; however, the above data were highly skewed. Overall no difference was noted in the number of people leaving the studies early because of any adverse effects between each study arm in the three studies comparing olanzapine and risperidone (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.04). Specific adverse events were not reported uniformly across the six different studies included in this section of the review; therefore it was difficult to do a head-to-head comparison of adverse events for different atypical antipsychotic medications.4. Lower-dose atypical antipsychotic versus standard/higher-dose atypical antipsychotic: Three studies reported comparisons of lower doses of the atypical antipsychotic medication with standard/higher doses of the same medication. One study reported better symptom reduction with a standard dose of risperidone as compared with a low dose (1 RCT, n = 257, RR -8.00, 95% CI -13.75 to -2.25). In another study, no difference was reported in the number of participants not achieving remission between the group receiving 10 mg/d and those who received 30 mg/d of aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 196, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48). Similarly in the other study, authors reported no statistically significant difference in clinical response between the two groups receiving lower-dose (80 mg/d) and higher-dose (160 mg/d) ziprasidone, as reflected by the mean end point BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 17, MD -4.40, 95% CI -19.20 to 10.40).", 
    "158": "No convincing evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic medications are superior to typical medications for the treatment of adolescents with psychosis. However, atypical antipsychotic medications may be more acceptable to young people because fewer symptomatic adverse effects are seen in the short term. Little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic medication over another, but side effect profiles are different for different medications. Treatment with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine is often associated with weight gain. Aripiprazole is not associated with increased prolactin or with dyslipidaemia. Adolescents may respond better to standard-dose as opposed to lower-dose risperidone, but for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, lower doses may be equally effective. Future trials should ensure uniform ways of reporting.",

Intra-basolateral amygdala (BLA) infusion of midazolam prior to stress prevented both the enhancement of fear retention and an increase in the density of total and mature dendritic spines in DH. These findings emphasize the role of the stress-induced attenuation of GABAergic neurotransmission in BLA in the promoting influence of stress on fear memory and on synaptic remodeling in DH. In conclusion, the structural remodeling in DH accompanied the facilitated fear memory following a combination of fear conditioning and stressful stimulation.",

They are located within the object-related ventral visual stream at the transition between early and higher-order (category-specific) visual areas. FG2 has a topographical position which is best comparable to the face or visual word-form recognition area. However, the precise function of FG2 is presently unknown. Since transmitter receptors are key molecules of neurotransmission, we analysed the regional and laminar distribution of 15 different receptor binding sites by means of quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Significant differences between receptor densities of both areas were found for NMDA, GABAB, M3, nicotinic \u03b14/\u03b22 and 5-HT1A receptors as well as for GABAA associated benzodiazepine binding sites. These results support the cytoarchitectonic segregation of FG1 and FG2 into two distinct cortical areas. In addition, principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses of the multireceptor data of both fusiform areas and 24 visual, auditory, somatosensory and multimodal association areas not only revealed the typical receptor architectonic characteristics of visual areas for FG1 and FG2, but also suggest their putative function as object recognition regions due to the similarity of their receptor fingerprints with those of areas of the ventral visual stream. Furthermore, FG1 and FG2 build a cluster with the multimodal association areas of the inferior parietal lobule. This underlines their hierarchically high position in the visual system of the human cerebral cortex.", 
    "167": "Based on evidence of an increased risk of death, drug agencies issued safety warnings about the use of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in the elderly with dementia. The French agency issued a warning in 2004. which was extended to all antipsychotics in 2008. Little is known about the impact of these warnings on use. We conducted a quasi-experimental study (interrupted time-series) in France, for 2003-2011, including subjects aged \u226565 with dementia and subjects aged \u226565 without dementia in the EGB database (1/97th representative random sample of claims from the main Health Insurance scheme). Outcomes were monthly rates of use of antipsychotics (by class and agent) and of five comparison drug classes (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, dermatologicals, antidiabetics, antiasthmatics). Trends were analyzed by joinpoint regression, impact of warnings by linear segmented regression. In patients with dementia (n=7169), there was a 40% reduction in antipsychotic use from 14.2% in 2003 to 10.2% in 2011. The reduction began before 2004 and was unaffected by the warnings. Use of first generation antipsychotics declined over the period, while use of SGAs increased and leveled off from 2007. Use of the five comparison drug classes increased on the period. In subjects without dementia (n=91,942), rates of overall antipsychotic use decreased from 2.3% in 2003 to 1.8% in 2011 with no effect of the warnings. Meanwhile, use of SGAs continuously increased from 0.37% to 0.64%. Antipsychotic use decreased in the elderly between 2003 and 2011, especially in dementia. The timing of the decrease, however, did not coincide with safety warnings.", 
    "168": "Not only is the inferior colliculus (IC) a highly important center of integration within the central auditory pathway, but it may also play a modulatory role in sensory-motor circuitry. Previous evidence from our laboratory relating the IC to motor behavior shows that glutamate-mediated mechanisms within the IC modulate haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The high density of GABAergic receptors in the IC led to this study of a possible link between these receptors, haloperidol-induced catalepsy, and a possible involvement of the blockade of dopaminergic receptors. Catalepsy was evaluated by positioning both forepaws of rats on an elevated horizontal wooden bar and recording the time that the animal maintained this position. The present study shows that haloperidol-induced catalepsy was enhanced by local microinjection into the IC of midazolam (20nmol/0.5\u03bcl), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, whereas animals receiving a microinjection of bicuculline (40 or 80ng/0.5\u03bcl), a GABAergic antagonist, showed a reduction in the time of catalepsy. However, the microinjection of haloperidol (2.5 or 5.0\u03bcg/0.5\u03bcl) bilaterally into the IC did not induce catalepsy. Therefore, our results suggest the involvement of the IC in the modulation of catalepsy induced by haloperidol, even though the dopaminergic mechanisms of the IC are unable to induce catalepsy when blocked by the direct microinjection of haloperidol. It is thus possible that the IC plays a role in sensorimotor gating and that GABA-mediated mechanisms are involved.", 
    "169": "A new approach for calculation of sample size in pediatric clinical pharmacokinetic studies was suggested based on desired precision for a pharmacokinetic parameter of interest. The estimate of variability for sample size calculations could be obtained from different sources. It is not known whether these sources constantly show higher/lower variability across compounds and age groups. We obtained estimates of variability for clearance, volume of distribution and area under the plasma concentration-time curve for 5 drugs from adult/pediatric classic clinical pharmacokinetic studies, and physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) combined with in vitro-in vivo extrapolation. Estimates were applied to the proposal methodology for non-compartmental analysis. Sample size was different for each drug based on various estimates of variability from different pharmacokinetic parameters and depending on the age. Overall, there was no consistent discrepancy in sample size calculated according to the source of variability. A conservative approach should be taken when using \"precision based methodology\" knowing that various sources of initial estimates of variability will not lead to similar sample size calculations. Although PBPK simulations could be used for estimating variability, further work is required to investigate the best approach to estimate variability of pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric populations and hence sample size calculations.", 
    "170": "Orphan symptoms are rarely assessed, particularly at home. The aim of this multicenter prospective study was to assess the prevalence of these symptoms and eventual factors possibly associated in advanced cancer patients at admission of a home care program. A prospective study was performed at three home care programs in Italy. Patients' data were collected, including age, sex, diagnosis, and Karnofsky status. Possible contributing factors were analyzed; preexisting neurological diseases, cerebral metastases, hyperthermia, diabetes, a state of dehydration clinically evident and/or oliguria, possible biochemical parameters when available, data regarding recent chemotherapy, opioids and doses, use of neuroleptics, benzodiazepine or anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory, and antibiotics were collected. Myoclonus, hiccup, sweating, pruritus, and tenesmus, either rectal or vesical, were assessed, according to a preliminary definition, at time of home care program admission. Three hundred sixty-two patients were surveyed at the three home care programs. Globally, 48 patients presented one or more orphan symptoms in the period taken into consideration, and 7 patients presented more than 1 symptom. One patient presented occasional and diffuse myoclonus. Nineteen patients presented sweating, 13 patients presented pruritus, and 14 patients presented hiccup. Finally, nine patients presented rectal or vesical tenesmus. There was a significant correlation between sweating and transdermal fentanyl use (P\u2009=\u20090.044), fever (P\u2009=\u20090.001), hiccup (P\u2009<\u20090.0005), and vesical tenesmus (P\u2009=\u20090.028).

    "171": "GABAA receptor mediated inhibition plays an important role in modulating the input/output dynamics of cerebellum. A characteristic of cerebellar GABAA receptors is the presence in cerebellar granule cells of subunits such as \u03b16 and \u03b4 which give insensitivity to classical benzodiazepines. In fact, cerebellar GABAA receptors have generally been considered a poor model for testing drugs which potentially are active at the benzodiazepine site. In this overview we show how rat cerebellar granule cells in culture may be a useful model for studying new benzodiazepine site agonists. This is based on the pharmacological separation of diazepam-sensitive \u03b11 \u03b22/3 \u03b32 receptors from those which are diazepam-insensitive and contain the \u03b16 subunit. This is achieved by utilizing furosemide/Zn(2+) which block \u03b16 containing and incomplete receptors.",

All patients admitted to our hospital for SE from September 2010 to April 2012 were evaluated. We collected related variables including the type of SE, etiology, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used, loading dose of AEDs, cessation of SE after AEDs, ICU admission and mortality. In those patients receiving LCM, we reviewed the infusion rate and time to response. We compared patients receiving LCM with patients in whom it was not used. This was a retrospective and uncontrolled study. A total of 92 patients were included; 67.7 % of SE patients who received LCM responded to treatment. The vast majority of the patients presented non-convulsive and motor focal SE. When we selected patients to receive four or more AEDs, the LCM efficacy was 55.6 %, a very similar result compared to when it was not used. Subsequently, we analyzed the sample regarding the AED administered as the second or third line of treatment, and the responder rate was significantly higher when LCM was used (84.6 vs. 47.8 %, p 0.041). After an adjusted regression analysis, the use of LCM was independently associated with cessation of SE. The total percentage of undesirable effects was very low (12 %), and they were all mild. No relationship was found between a specific etiology and better response. LCM is a useful drug that represents an alternative in the treatment of non-convulsive or focal motor SE. Its efficacy might be more important when it is administered as a second or third option after benzodiazepines. A randomized trial is required to confirm these results.",

    "188": "Dogs were sedated with acepromazine 0.025\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) and morphine 0.25\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) intramuscularly (IM), 30\u00a0minutes prior to induction of anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to receive midazolam (MP; 0.2\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) ) or sterile normal saline (CP; 0.04 mL\u00a0kg(-1) ) intravenously (IV) over 15\u00a0seconds. Propofol was administered IV immediately following test drug and delivered at 3\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) \u00a0minute(-1) until intubation was possible. Scoring of pre-induction sedation, ease of intubation, quality of induction, and presence or absence of excitement following co-induction agent, was recorded. HR, SAP and respiratory rate (fR ) were obtained immediately prior to, immediately following, and 5\u00a0minutes following induction of anesthesia.", 
    "189": "There were no significant differences between groups with regard to weight, age, gender, or sedation. Excitement occurred in 5/9 dogs following midazolam administration, with none noted in the control group. The dose of propofol administered to the midazolam group was significantly less than in the control group. Differences in HR were not significant between groups. SAP was significantly lower in the midazolam group compared with baseline values 5\u00a0minutes after its administration. However, values remained clinically acceptable.", 
    "190": "The co-administration of midazolam with propofol decreased the total dose of propofol needed for induction of anesthesia in sedated healthy dogs, caused some excitement and a clinically unimportant decrease in SAP.", 
    "191": "Detoxification refers to the safe discontinuation from a substance of dependence and is distinct from relapse prevention. Detoxification usually takes between a few days and a few weeks to complete, depending on the substance being misused, the severity of dependence and the support available to the user. Psychosocial therapies alongside pharmacological treatments are essential to improve outcome. The dependencies considered in this overview are detoxification from opioids (with methadone, buprenorphine, \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonists and adjunct medications), alcohol (with benzodiazepines, anti-glutamatergics and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic drugs), stimulants and cannabis (with no clear recommended pharmacological treatments), benzodiazepines (with dose tapering) and nicotine (with nicotine replacement therapy, antidepressants and partial agonists). Evidence is limited by a lack of controlled trials robust enough for review bodies, and more research is required into optimal treatment doses and regimes, alone and in combination.", 
    "192": "In drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) cases, drug residues may be detected in beverage remains found in cups or glasses known to have been used by the victims. In this small naturalistic study, the possibility of beverages being contaminated, either by drug concentrated oral fluid or by oral cavity contained tablets, was investigated. Analysis of residues from cups containing soft drinks was performed by immunoassay and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Beverage with both added tablets and spiked oral fluid was investigated, as well as simulation of swallowing tablets. Only the residues from added tablets were positive with immunoassay, while drugs were detectable in all cups using more sensitive UPLC-MS/MS. In conclusion, the possibility of detecting drug residues in beverages due to a contamination, from either drug concentrated oral fluid or oral cavity contained tablets at a time of consumption, should be kept in mind when performing sensitive analysis.", 
    "193": "Understanding the molecular mechanism by which probes and chemotherapeutic agents bind to nucleic acids is a fundamental issue in modern drug design. From a computational perspective, valuable insights are gained by the estimation of free energy landscapes as a function of some collective variables (CVs), which are associated with the molecular recognition event. Unfortunately the choice of CVs is highly non-trivial because of DNA's high flexibility and the presence of multiple association-dissociation events at different locations and/or sliding within the grooves. Here we have applied a modified version of Locally-Scaled Diffusion Map (LSDMap), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for decoupling multiple-timescale dynamics in macromolecular systems, to a metadynamics-based free energy landscape calculated using a set of intuitive CVs. We investigated the binding of the organic drug anthramycin to a DNA 14-mer duplex. By performing an extensive set of metadynamics simulations, we observed sliding of anthramycin along the full-length DNA minor groove, as well as several detachments from multiple sites, including the one identified by X-ray crystallography. As in the case of equilibrium processes, the LSDMap analysis is able to extract the most relevant collective motions, which are associated with the slow processes within the system, i.e., ligand diffusion along the minor groove and dissociation from it. Thus, LSDMap in combination with metadynamics (and possibly every equivalent method) emerges as a powerful method to describe the energetics of ligand binding to DNA without resorting to intuitive ad hoc reaction coordinates."
