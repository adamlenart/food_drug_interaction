Several reports demonstrated that FG7142 produced anxiety in humans, non-human primates, and rodents, and impaired working memory in non-human primates and rodents. In this study, we examined the effect of FG7142 on cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) in conscious rhesus monkeys. Male rhesus monkeys were intramuscularly treated with FG7142 (0.2 or 1.0 mg/kg, n=5, respectively), and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) were measured by PET 20 min and 40 min after treatment, respectively. During PET measurement, physiological parameters and plasma cortisol levels were monitored. FG7142 significantly decreased rCBF in the thalamus and rCMRglc in all brain regions examined in a dose-dependent manner without changes in physiological parameters. FG7142 also significantly increased plasma cortisol levels. The present study may provide an important insight into the understanding of the pathophysiology of anxiety and stress-related disorders in humans, and strongly suggesting that prevention of anxiety or stress is important when measuring conscious brain function.",

    "2": "The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus those of haloperidol during transition from IM to PO therapy. We used additional data from a previously reported trial to test the hypothesis that the reduction in agitation achieved by IM olanzapine 10 mg or IM haloperidol 7.5 mg would be maintained following transition to 4 days of PO olanzapine or PO haloperidol (5-20 mg/d for both). We also hypothesized that olanzapine would maintain its more favorable extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) safety profile.", 
    "3": "This was a multinational (hospitals in 13 countries), double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Acutely agitated inpatients with schizophrenia were treated with 1 to 3 IM injections to olanzapine 10 mg or haloperidol 7.5 mg over 24 hours and were entered into a 4-day PO treatment period with the same medication (5-20 mg/d for both). The primary efficacy measurement was reduction in agitation, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score. Adverse events and scores on EPS rating scales were assessed.", 
    "4": "A total of 311 patients (204 men, 107 women; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [11.6] years) were enrolled (131, 126, and 54 patients in the olanzapine, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively). In all, 93.1% (122/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 92.1% (116/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the IM period and entered the PO period; 85.5% (112/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 84.1% (106/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the PO period. IM olanzapine and IM haloperidol effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours (mean [SD] PANSS-EC change, -7.1 [4.81 vs -6.7 [4.3], respectively). Reductions in agitation were sustained throughout the PO period with both study drugs (mean [SD] change from PO period baseline, -0.6 [4.8] vs -1.3 [4.4], respectively). During PO treatment, haloperidol-treated patients spontaneously reported significantly more acute dystonia than olanzapine-treated patients (4.3%[5/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.026) and akathisia (5.2% [6/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.013). Significantly more haloperidol-treated patients than olanzapine-treated patients met categorical criteria for treatment-emergent akathisia (18.5% [17/92] vs 6.5% [7/107], respectively; P = 0.015).", 
    "5": "In the acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia in this study, both IM olanzapine 10 mg and IM haloperidol 7.5 mg effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours. This alleviation of agitation was sustained following transition from IM therapy to 4 days of PO treatment (5-20 mg/d for both). During the 4 days of PO treatment, olanzapine-treated patients did not spontaneously report any incidences of acute dystonia, and olanzapine had a superior EPS safety profile to that of haloperidol. The combination of IM and PO olanzapine may help improve the treatment of acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "6": "Few studies have investigated methadone treatment of opiate dependent patients in primary health care settings. Using a prospective cohort design, the study investigated outcomes at 1 and 2 years for 240 patients treated by general practitioners (n = 79) or drug clinics (n = 161) at sites across England. Mean daily methadone dose for both groups was 50 mg. Reductions in illicit drug use, injecting, sharing injecting equipment, psychological and physical health problems, and crime, were found in both groups at follow-up. Patients treated in general practitioner (GP) settings reported less frequent benzodiazepine and stimulant use, and fewer psychological health problems at follow-up. Alcohol use outcomes were poor for both groups. Differences in treatment practices were found for GPs and clinics. Results show substantial reductions in a range of problems behaviours, among unselected samples of opiate dependent patients treated in GP and in clinic settings, which are sustained to 1-year and 2-year follow-up.", 
    "7": "Experimental and clinical data indicate that epilepsy and seizures lead to neuronal cell loss and irreversible brain damage. This neurodegeneration results not only in the central nervous system dysfunction but may also be responsible for the decreased efficacy of some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The aim of this review was to assemble current literature data on neuroprotective properties of AEDs. The list of hypothetical neuroprotectants is long and consists of substances which act via different mechanisms. We focus on AEDs since this heterogeneous group of pharmaceuticals, as far as mechanisms of their action and mechanisms of neuronal death are concerned, should provide protection in addition to antiseizure effect itself. Most studies on neuroprotection are based on animal experimental models of neuronal degeneration. Electrically and pharmacologically evoked seizures as well as different models of ischemia are frequently used. Although our knowledge about properties of AEDs is still not complete and discrepancies occasionally occur, the group seems to be promising in terms of neuroprotection. Some of the drugs, though, turn out to be neutral or even have adverse effects on the central nervous system, especially on immature brain tissue (barbiturates and benzodiazepines). Unfortunatelly, we cannot fully extrapolate animal data to humans, therefore further well designed clinical trials are necessary to determine neuroprotective properties of AEDs in humans. However, there is a hope that AEDs will have a potential to serve as neuroprotectants not only in seizures, but perhaps, in other neurodegenerative conditions in humans as well. The novel AEDs (especially lamotrigine, tiagabine, and topiramate) seem particularly promising.",

    "9": "We have used a case series as a basis for the description of sexsomina.", 
    "10": "Eleven patients with distinct behaviours of the sexual nature during sleep are described. The features in common with other nonrapid eye movement arousal parasomnias, such as sleepwalking are documented. Some patients had simply been referred to a tertiary sleep clinic for investigation of unrelated sleep problems. A small number had been involved in medicolegal issues. Sexsomnia has some distinct features that separate it from sleepwalking. The automatic arousal is more prominent, motor activities are relatively restricted and specific, and some form of dream mentation is often present.",

    "12": "In these studies patients with first myocardial infarction (MI) were selected for studies focusing on epidemiology, risk factors and treatment of depression post-MI. Two consecutive cohorts of first MI patients were included. The first cohort was selected between May 1994 and May 1997 (n = 206), and the second between May 1997 and October 1999 (n = 206). All patients were screened every 3 months for depression using the SCL-90 and the Zung (cohort 1) or SCL-90, BDI and HADS (cohort 2) until 12 months post-MI. Patients scoring above the cut-off of one of the questionnaires were interviewed using a standardised interview in order to evaluate whether DSM-IV criteria for major depression were met; patients of the second cohort were also interviewed 1 month post-MI, independently of the score of the questionnaires. Of both cohorts data concerning major cardiac events and increased health care consumption were assessed during a 1 to 6 years follow-up period. Patients with major depression were offered treatment in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial with fluoxetine (n = 54). Depression appeared to be a predictor of increased health care consumption, but not of major cardiac events such as cardiac death and recurrent infarction in first myocardial infarction (MI) patients up to 6 years post-MI. This finding is in contrast to findings in the literature indicating that in patient populations with mixed first and recurrent MI, depression is a risk factor for cardiac mortality. In contrast to depression, symptoms of anxiety do predict cardiac mortality and recurrent MI in patients following first MI independently of other risk factors of cardiac mortality. Recognition of risk factors for post-MI depression may help the cardiologist to identify patients at risk for depression. Examples of such risk factors are, according to our studies, complications during admission, such as arrhythmic disorders and recurrent angina pectoris, and prescription of benzodiazepines. Patients at risk can be screened for depression using a 4-item questionnaire, and, if scoring is positive, be referred for psychiatric evaluation. Although the effectivity of antidepressive treatment in MI patients has as yet not been proven, we found that fluoxetine is a cardiac-safe antidepressive agent, but only in mild depression more effective than placebo. The positive effect of antidepressive treatment on cardiac prognosis has as yet not been shown.", 
    "13": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury has been associated with both early and late effects on allografts in the form of delayed graft function and decreased graft survival. Recent studies demonstrated that functional parameters were influenced by cold storage conditions and particularly the ratio of Na+:K+ of the preservation solution.",

Kidneys were harvested, cold flushed, and preserved for 24, 48, or 72 hr with HEH, Celsior solution, or University of Wisconsin solution and autotransplanted. Renal function was determined on days 1, 3, 7, and 14, and at 4 to 16 weeks after autotransplantation. Histologic changes and cell infiltration were assessed on kidney biopsy specimens taken after reperfusion (30-40 min), at days 5 and 14, and at 4 to 5 and 10 to 12 weeks after surgery. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a structural mitochondrial protein, was also studied.", 
    "15": "Cold storage in HEH resulted in reduction of delayed graft function and renal damage, with a decrease in interstitial inflammation. HEH reduced interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and improved PBR expression.", 
    "16": "This study suggests that cold preservation in HEH has a beneficial action in in vivo renal preservation and reduces tubular necrosis, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis in these groups. In addition, PBR detection was correlated to the level of preservation integrity.", 
    "17": "To gain insight into the strategy to target PBR ligand-drug conjugates to brain tumors, novel N-imidazopyridinacetyl-melphalan conjugates and the corresponding ethyl esters have been prepared and evaluated for their cytotoxicity in melphalan-sensitive human (SF126, SF188) and rat (RG-2) glioma cell lines. These conjugates exhibited PBR binding affinity with IC(50) values ranging from 57 and 2614 nM. By a computational approach it can be predicted that these conjugates possess significant brain penetration. The stability of the conjugates in 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and, in some cases, in dilute human serum solution was determined. All the ethyl ester derivatives were stable in 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and their half-lives exceeded 28 h. Conversely, under the same conditions, the corresponding acids were found to undergo a fast cleavage within a few minutes. HPLC-MS analysis of the mixture from degradation in buffer and physiological medium of the representative cases allowed the identification of their main degradation products. A plausible degradation pathway accounting for the available experimental data is presented.", 
    "18": "Spasticity is a common problem in paediatric neurology and its management constitutes a real professional challenge. There are numerous therapeutic options available and their advantages and disadvantages should be carefully weighed up for each individual patient. It is true that we do not have one single final option, but experience and knowledge of the therapeutic possibilities favour the functional improvement of patients suffering from spasticity. In this paper, we analyse the different drugs available for oral administration in the treatment of spasticity. Special attention is given to the side effects and interactions of these drugs in multiple deficiency patients, who are usually already receiving other medication. We review the mechanism of action, the forms of presentation and dosage, the side effects and interactions of baclofen, diazepam, clonidine, tizanidine, modafilin, gabapentin and dantrolene. Finally, other drugs that may be useful in improving spasticity are also analysed.", 
    "19": "Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) is an epileptic syndrome recognised by the ICE of 1985 and 1989 and in the proposal put forward by the ILAE Task Force on Classification and Terminology in 2001. In this paper, its historical development, nosological characteristics and treatment are described.", 
    "20": "Although identified by Dravet in 1978, it has been called severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy since 1981. As an alternative the name polymorphic epilepsy has also been put forward and in 2001 the ILAE recognised the eponym Dravet's syndrome. We describe how it may be mistaken for febrile convulsions in the early stages and later for Lennox Gastaut syndrome, Doose's myoclonic astatic epilepsy and certain progressive myoclonic epilepsies. We outline the risk factors, recognised in 1992, that facilitate an early diagnosis and the defining clinical criteria established in 1984. We point out the existence of atypical forms due to the absence of some of the defining criteria, which will never be above one, to formulate a diagnosis of SMEI. The frequency with which a family background of febrile convulsions and epilepsy appears seems to point to a genetic origin. Recently, de novo mutations have been found in the alpha subunit of the voltage dependent sodium channel as well as mutations in the gamma subunit of the GABAA receptor. Nosologically, it is located in group 3 of the 1989 ICE, which corresponds to epileptic syndromes without a focal determination, or which are generalised, and on the list of epilepsy/syndromes that was presented in 2001. SMEI is an epilepsy syndrome which is, in most cases, resistant to classical and new AED, and other more unusual treatment. The drugs that have proved to be more effective, although only relatively so, are topiramate, valproate and the benzodiazepines. At present another alternative that has appeared is stiripentol. Intravenous use of immunoglobulins can be useful.", 
    "21": "Dravet's syndrome, admitted as such by the ILAE in 2001 and probably caused by de novo mutations in the sodium channels or in the GABAA receptors, is one of the severest forms of epilepsy in infancy with very little or no response to current antiepileptic drugs. Those that have been seen to be most effective are topiramate, the benzodiazepines, valproate and, more recently, stiripentol.", 
    "22": "The case of a 73-year-old male with delusions of parasitosis (DP) is presented. He complained about severe itching of the limbs and the genital region as well as abnormal body and pubic hair that he believed to be parasites. The symptoms occurred over the course of several years together with severe heart diseases (New York Heart Association class III, atrial fibrillation, tricuspid regurgitation) and chronic edema of the lower leg. The pruritus was also based on chronic, self-induced skin lesions due to aggressive disinfection and tearing out of body hair. After ruling out true infection, a multimodal DP therapy was initiated. Instead of the standard neuroleptic drug pimozide, olanzapine was used because of its better tolerability in patients with increased cardiac risk (i.e., borderline prolonged QTc time). At discharge, the DP had partially remitted. Substantial improvement in the heart and skin diseases under specific treatment contributed substantially to the success of the therapeutic regimen. This case hints at (1) the effectiveness of olanzapine in DP and (2) the importance of general medical conditions in the therapeutic approach to DP.", 
    "23": "Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Its action is exerted in the brain through GABA(A) receptors which belong to the family of ligand-gated ion channels. These GABA(A) receptors consist of various subunits and are targets for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neuroactive steroids, and distinct anticonvulsive agents. Meanwhile, there is considerable evidence that a dysfunction of GABA(A) receptors plays an important role in the pathophysiology of panic disorder. The anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder. Nevertheless, side effects of benzodiazepines, e.g., dependency and withdrawal symptoms, limit their use as a long-term treatment. In the meantime, antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, comprise first-line treatment in the pharmacotherapy of panic disorder. They interfere with the synthesis of endogenous neuroactive steroids that allosterically modulate GABA(A) receptor function. With regard to experimentally evoked panic attacks in patients with panic disorder and healthy controls, recent investigations demonstrated that enhancing endogenous GABA through the blockade of the GABA transaminase by vigabatrin or inhibition of GABA transporters by tiagabine may exert anxiolytic effects. This novel strategy targeting the GABA binding site of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex and specific agonists for the benzodiazepine binding site present interesting perspectives for the future pharmacotherapy of panic disorder.",

    "26": "Seventy-six percent of the enrolled patients completed the full treatment session. All treatments were conducted in an outpatient setting with minimal discomfort for subjects and no major complications. Pathologic examination of the uterus confirmed that magnetic resonance imaging guidance provides the safe and accurate delivery of effective levels of thermal energy with a 3-fold increase in volume of histologically documented necrosis, compared with treatment volume (6.6 +/- 0.8 vs 18.4 +/- 3.9 mL, P <.005).",

The patient demonstrated generalized prolonged myoclonus severe enough to produce temperatures of 41.4 degrees C and CPK elevations to 7281 U/l. This myoclonus was unresponsive to benztropine, clonazepam and worsened with bromocriptine. It resolved with sleep induced by either lorazepam or diphenhydramine and during treatment with reserpine. Once discharged from the hospital and treated with reserpine, there were much less frequent recurrences of the myoclonus that responded well to concomitant treatment with clonazepam. Later attempts to reduce the reserpine resulted in worsening of the myoclonus. Older patients with Angelman syndrome may display a wide variety of neurologic syndromes. This severe myoclonus in this patient worsened with dopamine agonist treatment and initially improved with dopamine depletion therapy while in the long-term responding best to a combination of clonazepam and reserpine.",

    "32": "Few publications compared the bioequivalence and efficacy of brand-name and generic psychoactive drugs. Those that were identified revealed differences in the efficacy and tolerability of brand-name and generic psychoactive drugs that had not been noted in the original bioequivalence studies. Specifically, l study found that plasma levels of phenytoin were 31% lower after a switch from a brand-name to a generic product. Several controlled studies of carbamazepine showed a recurrence of convulsions after the shift to a generic formulation. After a sudden recurrence of seizures when generic valproic acid was substituted for the brand-name product, an investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration found a difference in bioavailability between the 2 formulations. Statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic variables have been reported in favor of brand-name versus generic diazepam (P < 0.001). Finally, a case report involving paroxetine mesylate cast doubt on the tolerability and efficacy of the generic formulation.",

    "34": "Prolongation of the QTc interval has been reported during treatment with oral antipsychotic agents and may be more pronounced during parenteral administration. Pooled QTc interval data from acutely agitated patients across four double-blind trials were compared. Databases included: placebo-controlled [two schizophrenia, one bipolar mania trials (n=565)]; haloperidol-controlled [two schizophrenia trials (n=482)]; geriatric placebo-controlled [1 dementia trial (n=204)]. Patients received 1-3 injections of intramuscular (IM) olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/injection), IM haloperidol (7.5 mg/injection), or IM placebo. At 2 and 24 h after IM olanzapine treatment, the mean QTc interval decreased approximately 3 ms from baseline in the placebo- and haloperidol-controlled databases. When there was a statistically significant difference between IM olanzapine and IM placebo, QTc intervals decreased during treatment with IM olanzapine and increased with IM placebo. The incidences of prolonged (endpoint >/=99th percentile of healthy adults or >/=500 ms) or lengthened (increase >/=60 ms) QTc intervals during treatment with IM olanzapine (<3% placebo- and haloperidol-controlled databases, <12% geriatric placebo-controlled database) were never significantly greater than with comparators. These data suggest that IM olanzapine has a favorable QTc interval profile in acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or dementia.", 
    "35": "One of the major differences between the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine is that clozapine has a two-fold higher affinity for the alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors. As clozapine can have therapeutic benefits in individuals that do not respond to other antipsychotic drugs, this raises the possibility that changes in the alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors could be a marker for a predisposition to treatment resistance. A methodology has been optimised to measure the binding of [3H]RX 821002 to alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors in human postmortem CNS and has shown that these receptors are not altered in Brodmann's area 9 from subjects with schizophrenia. These data add to those of one other study that showed the alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors were not altered in Brodmann's area 10 and the hippocampus from subjects with schizophrenia, and do not support the hypothesis that changes in alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors are a marker for treatment resistance in schizophrenia.",

Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V staining. Besides altering the pancreatic redox status, long-term CCK blockade inhibited the normal proliferation of acinar cells as indicated by the significant increase in G(0)/G(1)-phase cells and the decrease in G(2)/M-cells found in control rats treated with L364,718 for 7 days. A progressive depletion in pancreatic GSH was found from 3 to 24h after BPDO with similar values in L364,718-pretreated and non-treated rats, which led to a maximum peak in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels 6h after BPDO. However, plasma amylase activity and ascites volume indicated higher severity of AP in L364,718-pretreated rats. CCK blockade enhanced the alterations that appear in cell cycle distribution of acinar cells during AP demonstrated by the significantly higher increase in G(0)/G(1)-cells and decrease in S-cells found in L364,718-treated rats 48h after BPDO. Our results indicate that the renewal of acinar cells deleted by apoptosis 48h after BPDO worsens if CCK is blocked before inducing AP.", 
    "37": "Conscious intravenous sedation is a safe alternative method to general anaesthesia. We have used a technique of continuously titrated, as opposed to incremental boluses of, intravenous or intramuscular midazolam for conscious sedation, with tumescent adrenaline-lignocaine solution for local anaesthesia, routinely in 421 plastic surgical procedures between 1997 and 2000. All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II. Conscious sedation was administered through our protocol of continuously titrated doses of midazolam in dextrose saline. The operative field was injected subcutaneously with varying volumes of diluted lignocaine and adrenaline, depending on the anatomical region. Preoperative sedation was administered 1 h before the procedure in the form of an intramuscular injection of pethidine and promethazine (Phenergan). Intraoperatively, a subset of patients received up to four divided diluted doses of pethidine. A preoperative 4 h starvation period pronounced the effect of the sedative. No intraoperative conversions to general anaesthesia were needed, and no sedation complications occurred. No unplanned re-admissions secondary to nausea, prolonged drowsiness or pain were required. All patients who were treated using this technique had an uneventful postoperative course. Hospital stay was substantially shorter than following general anaesthesia, which provided a significant reduction in medical-care expenses and a faster return to work. In conclusion, conscious sedation administered by titrated intravenous midazolam is a well-tolerated, safe, consistent, predictable and effective anaesthetic choice for a variety of plastic surgical procedures, many of which would commonly be performed under general anaesthesia.", 
    "38": "The molecular mechanisms that underlie ethanol dependence involve alterations in the functional properties and subunit expression of GABAA receptors. Chronic ethanol exposure decreases GABAA receptor alpha1 subunits and increases alpha4 subunit levels in cerebral cortical membranes. This study explored the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on internalization of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors. Chronic ethanol exposure increased alpha1 subunit levels by 46 +/- 12% and [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 35 +/- 9% in the clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) fraction. There was a corresponding 34 +/- 8% decrease in alpha1 peptide expression and 37 +/- 6% decrease in [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the synaptic fraction. Chronic ethanol consumption also increased the alpha1 subunit immunoprecipitate in the cytosolic fraction (77 +/- 22%), measured by western blot analysis. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation of both clathrin and adaptin-alpha with alpha1 subunits was increased in the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that alpha1 subunit endocytosis is enhanced by chronic ethanol consumption. In contrast, alpha4 subunit peptide levels were not altered in the CCV fraction despite a 39 +/- 13% increase in peptide levels in the synaptic fraction of cortex. Moreover, acute ethanol exposure did not alter alpha1 subunit peptide expression or [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the synaptic or CCV fractions. These results suggest that chronic ethanol consumption selectively increases internalization of alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors in cerebral cortex.",

The new anticonvulsant compound topiramate seems to be an especially promising drug for this indication. It acts, among others, as an AMPA antagonist, which may be responsible in part for its anticonvulsant efficacy, but may also modulate the withdrawal-induced activation of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, which are related to some behavioural effects of benzodiazepine withdrawal. A case is presented of a rapid benzodiazepine-withdrawal treated successfully with topiramate.",

The large majority were drivers (55%) followed by passengers (19.7%), cyclists (12.6%) and pedestrians (12.3%). Alcohol was obviously the most commonly found drug in all groups (drivers: 36.9%; passengers: 15.1%; cyclists: 29.4%; pedestrians: 18.2%), with a mean BAC (blood alcohol concentration) high above the legal limit at the time of the study in Austria of 0.8 g/l (drivers: 1.49 +/- 54 g/l; passengers: 1.52 +/- 71 g/l; cyclists: 1.72 +/- 51 g/l; pedestrians: 1.67 +/- 25 g/l). The percentage of alcohol users was highest in drivers. Concerning BAC levels no significant differences were found between the groups. The most commonly detected benzodiazepine was diazepam. Benzodiazepine consumption (drivers: 8.1%; passengers: 5.7%; cyclists: 8.8%; pedestrians: 3%) as well as plasma levels (drivers: 68.7 +/- 62.6 microg/l; passengers: 61.0 +/- 69.3 microg/l; cyclists: 135.7 +/- 118.3 microg/l; pedestrians: 18 microg/l) were nearly equal in all groups.

    "42": "Anxiety disorders are common disorders in childhood, and developmental differences must be considered when diagnosing and treating patients in this age group. Recent research has illuminated the course of childhood anxiety disorders, including how they can be precursors to continued anxiety and mood problems in adulthood. Recent studies of cognitive-behavioral therapy, the first-line psychosocial treatment for childhood anxiety, have focused on the following issues: the relative efficacy of group versus individual cognitive-behavioral therapy; the role of parent involvement; and the application of specific techniques to certain diagnostic groups (eg, social skills techniques in social phobia). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been associated with high acute response rates in controlled studies of children with anxiety disorders, and more recent evidence suggests they are efficacious and well tolerated when taken for longer periods.

In Link\u00f6ping deep sedation using intravenous propofol is the method of sedation being used and parents are not present during the biopsy procedure. In Norrk\u00f6ping conscious sedation using intravenous midazolam is the routine and parents stay with their child throughout the whole biopsy procedure. The aim of this study was to find out whether the preprocedural and procedural differences between the clinics affected the way in which the parents and children experienced the time before and during the biopsy procedure.", 
    "44": "A questionnaire was used to ask the parents of 102 children who had undergone small bowel capsule biopsy for their opinion regarding the discomfort experienced by their children. The parents' and children's experience was also compared with that of the paediatric nurse caring for the family during the biopsy procedure, and the paediatric gastroenterologist performing the biopsy.", 
    "45": "The differences regarding premedication and sedation between the two groups did not seem to affect the parents' or the children's total experience of the biopsy procedure, nor did the presence or absence of the parents throughout the biopsy procedure. As regards the sedation given, 95% of the parents did not think that their children suffered any discomfort at all. The total experience of the biopsy procedure on a five-grade scale (5 being very good, 1 being very bad) was 5 for the parents and 4 for the children in both centres. Parents and children in both centres were very satisfied with the way in which they were taken care of during their visit to the hospital. In both units there was an obvious correlation between how the paediatric nurse experienced the biopsy procedure and how the paediatric gastroenterologist did, but only a weak correlation between the experience of the parents and that of the paediatric gastroenterologist and paediatric nurse. The anxiety of the parents was similarly estimated by the paediatric gastroenterologist and the paediatric nurse in both centres. There was no correlation between their assessment and the experience reported by the parents.", 
    "46": "The children undergoing small bowel biopsy and their parents felt well taken care of during their visit to the two hospitals. The differences between the clinics regarding method of sedation and presence or absence of the parents did not seem to affect how the parents and children experienced the biopsy procedure.", 
    "47": "LY 300164 [7-acetyl-3-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxazolo[4,5-h][2,3]-benzodiazepine], a novel AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, administered intraperitoneally protected mice against aminophylline-induced seizures. At doses up to 0.5 mg/kg, which did not significantly affect the convulsant activity of aminophylline, it potentiated the protective activity of diazepam. On the other hand, LY 300164 used at the lowest protective dose of 1.0 mg/kg enhanced anticonvulsant activity of all antiepileptic drugs tested in this seizure model. However, LY 300164 neither alone nor combined with antiepileptic drugs, reduced aminophylline-induced mortality.", 
    "48": "Effective tinnitus relief can be achieved in a large percentage of patients using appropriately selected wearable devices that provide masking of the tinnitus. Guidelines are presented for selecting between three types of devices for that purpose: (1) tinnitus maskers; (2) hearing aids; and (3) tinnitus instruments (units that combine hearing aid and masker in the same case). For patients whose tinnitus cannot be masked, oral administration of alprazolam may be an effective alternative, which should be done with the knowledge and cooperation of the patient's primary care physician. Dosages and guidelines for administering alprazolam are presented.", 
    "49": "Nausea is a common problem among palliative care patients, which is often undertreated. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, possesses a unique neurotransmitter binding profile that is similar to methotrimeprazine, an anti-emetic widely used in Europe for recalcitrant nausea. We report a case series of six patients who suffered nausea which was resistant to initial treatment with traditional antiemetics; each patient exhibited marked improvement when treated with olanzapine.", 
    "50": "Non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, in spite of their neuroprotective effects against neuronal ischemia, brain trauma, etc., cause neuronal damage in the rodent posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices (PC/RS), which are thought to be responsible brain regions for their psychotomimetic activity in humans. A number of anesthetics have not only GABAA receptor activating properties but also NMDA receptor antagonist properties. On the other hand, ketamine and nitrous oxide, both of which are potent non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists and have little GABAA activating properties, are demonstrated to induce neuronal damage in the rat PC/RS. Furthermore, ketamine potentiates the neuronal damage by nitrous oxide. Although many anesthetics, such as halothane, isoflurane, barbiturates and benzodiazepines, inhibit the neuronal damage in the PC/RS by NMDA receptor antagonists, probably through GABAA receptor activation, we anesthesiologists should be aware of the risk of ketamine or nitrous oxide anesthesia, not to speak of the combined use of them, without using GABAA receptor activating agents.", 
    "51": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic assay coupled with UV detection (239 nm) has been developed for the determination of midazolam and its synthesis precursors. The separation of the analytes was performed on a Kromasil C8 column (15 cm x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 microm) at 30 degrees C. The mobile phase [ammonium chloride (pH 5.5, 1 g l(-1))-methanolacetonitrile (45:22:33, v/v/v)] was pumped at a flow-rate of 1.5 ml min(-1). This method is rapid (less than 11 min), sensitive (limit of detection (LOD) ranged between 0.05 and 0.5 mg l(-1)) and selective for the determination of midazolam, and it could be used for monitoring different synthetic routes.", 
    "52": "Recent results suggest that treatment with the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine is associated with increased insulin and lipid levels.", 
    "53": "The aim of the present study was to investigate potential relationships between insulin or other hormones related to glucose-insulin homeostasis or lipids and steady-state serum concentrations of clozapine or olanzapine in patients on therapeutic doses.", 
    "54": "Thirty-four patients, diagnosed with schizophrenia or related psychoses according to the DSM-IV criteria and treated with clozapine ( n=18) or olanzapine ( n=16), were studied. Median treatment time with the antipsychotics was 5.3 years (range 0.5-16.3 years). Fasting blood samples for insulin, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, leptin, glucose and lipids were analyzed and investigated in relation to the patients' drug serum concentrations.", 
    "55": "Hyperinsulinemia was found in 30-60% of the patients, hyperglycemia in 10-30%, hyperlipidemia in 40-60% and hyperleptinemia in 10-20%. Moreover, levels of insulin, C-peptide and triglycerides correlated positively to the clozapine serum concentration and to the ratio of olanzapine to N-desmethylolanzapine concentrations. In contrast, levels of C-peptide, leptin and blood glucose were inversely correlated to the serum concentration of the metabolite N-desmethylolanzapine.", 
    "56": "Metabolic abnormalities (i.e. hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperleptinemia) and insulin resistance were associated with both clozapine and olanzapine treatments. Levels of insulin and triglycerides increased by increasing clozapine serum concentration and by increasing ratio of olanzapine to N-desmethylolanzapine; the last due to the metabolite N-desmethylolanzapine probably having an inverse effect to the main compound olanzapine. Thus, the metabolic abnormalities induced by these two drugs are clozapine-concentration dependent in clozapine-treated patients, and ratio of olanzapine to N-desmethylolanzapine-concentration dependent in olanzapine-treated patients.", 
    "57": "Transdermal nicotine reduces perioperative withdrawal symptoms when smoking is forbidden. We evaluated the influence of a transdermal nicotine system on cardiovascular response after endotracheal intubation. The study design was prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo- controlled. Sixty healthy smokers scheduled for minor surgery under general anesthesia were divided into two groups. The first group received a 21 mg/day transdermal nicotine system while the second group received a placebo transdermal system. After induction with standardized doses of fentanyl, thiopental and atracurium, the patients were intubated immediately when EMG-response decreased to 10% of the initial control. Heart rate and noninvasive arterial pressures were recorded 1 min and 5 min after intubation. The transdermal nicotine system significantly increased heart rate compared with the control group without nicotine substitution. Since the transdermal nicotine system increases heart rate it should not be used if tachycardia is potentially dangerous, such as in patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "58": "The present study was designed to examine the effects of diazepam, nitrazepam, desipramine and haloperidol on tail-swing behavior in mice and to characterize the effects of diazepam. Mice were suspended with rubber bands tied around their upper bodies in order to force their heads upwards. The duration of tail-swing behavior was then measured. Diazepam (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) and nitrazepam (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) significantly depressed tail-swing behavior, while they did not affect ambulation or muscle tone. In contrast, desipramine (10-30 mg/kg) did not affect tail-swing behavior, but at doses of 17.5 and 30 mg/kg produced a marked reduction in ambulation. Haloperidol (0.15 mg/kg) significantly decreased both tail-swing behavior and ambulation. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1 and 10 mg/kg), the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid N-methylamide (beta-CCM; 3 mg/kg) and the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (3 mg/kg) reversed the effects of diazepam (1 mg/kg) on tail-swing behavior, although administered alone they failed to influence such behavior. These results suggest that anxiety and/or fear are responsible for tail-swing behavior.", 
    "59": "The objective of this study was to determine whether long-term benzodiazepine use is associated with dose escalation.", 
    "60": "The authors examined changes in dose and the frequency of dose escalation among new and continuing (at least two years) recipients of benzodiazepines identified from a database containing drug-dispensing and health care use data for all New Jersey Medicaid patients for 39 months. Independent variables included age; Medicaid eligibility category; gender; race or ethnicity; neighborhood socioeconomic variables; chronic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar illness, panic disorder, and seizure disorder; and predominant benzodiazepine received. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between the independent variables and escalation to a high dosage (at least 20 diazepam milligram equivalents [DMEs] per day for elderly patients and at least 40 DMEs per day for younger patients).", 
    "61": "A total of 2,440 patients were identified, comprising 460 new and 1,980 continuing recipients. Seventy-one percent of continuing recipients had a permanent disability. Among all groups of continuing recipients, the median daily dosage remained constant at 10 DMEs during two years of continuous use. No clinically or statistically significant changes in dosage were observed over time. The incidence of escalation to a high dosage was 1.6 percent. Subgroups with a higher risk of dose escalation included antidepressant recipients and patients who filled duplicate prescriptions for benzodiazepines at different pharmacies within seven days. Elderly and disabled persons had a lower risk of dose escalation than younger patients.", 
    "62": "The results of this study did not support the hypothesis that long-term use of benzodiazepines frequently results in notable dose escalation.", 
    "63": "In Sweden, suicides by drug poisoning have decreased in the population at large during the past two decades. However, drug poisoning suicides increased among the elderly during this period. Suicides by benzodiazepine poisoning increased in this age group despite a reduction in prescription sales of these drugs. This study aims therefore to determine the role of benzodiazepines in suicide late in life.", 
    "64": "Information concerning all definite suicides and deaths due to \"undetermined\" causes recorded among Swedish citizens aged 65 and above during 1992 - 96 was obtained from the Cause-of-Death Register. Death certificates were scrutinized to determine the type of drug employed in drug-related suicides. Results of the post mortem screening for drugs and alcohol were then examined.", 
    "65": "A benzodiazepine was implicated in 216/548 (39%) of the drug poisoning suicides recorded among the elderly. Death certificates revealed that a benzodiazepine was the sole agent in 72% of these cases. Flunitrazepam or nitrazepam were implicated in 90% of the single benzodiazepine suicides. In addition to the suicides classified as drug poisonings, 82 cases were found in which a drug may have contributed to the cause of death. Benzodiazepines predominated. The terminal cause of death was drowning, often in the victim's own bathtub, in three-quarters of these cases. The annual fatality ratios for the newer benzodiazepine-like hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem appear to be on the rise.", 
    "66": "Benzodiazepines, especially the hypnotics flunitrazepam and nitrazepam, are common in drug poisoning suicides in the elderly and should be prescribed with caution for this age group.", 
    "67": "The purpose of this report is to review both fundamental studies in laboratory animals and preliminary clinical data suggesting that certain drugs may affect behavioural recovery after brain injury.", 
    "68": "Laboratory studies show that systemically-administered drugs that affect specific central neurotransmitters including norepinephrine and GABA influence affect recovery in a predictable manner. Although some drugs such as d-amphetamine have the potential to enhance recovery, others such as neuroleptics and other central dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and the anti-convulsants phenytoin and phenobarbital may be detrimental. In one study, 72% of patients with traumatic brain injury received one or a combination of the drugs that may impair recovery based on both animal experiments and studies in recovering stroke patients.", 
    "69": "Until the true impact of these classes of drugs are better understood, care should be exercised in the use of medications that may interfere with the recovery process in patients with traumatic brain injury. Additional research needs to be completed before the clinical efficacy of drugs that may enhance recovery can be established.", 
    "70": "Fixed and symptom-triggered taper methods during in-patient benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment were compared using a randomized controlled design. Forty-four benzodiazepine users seeking in-patient withdrawal treatment at two substance use treatment clinics in Adelaide, Australia were recruited. Measurements included the Severity of Dependence Scale and the SF-36. A scale comprising six items from the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale--Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) was used to measure withdrawal symptoms. Participants were randomized to receive a fixed diazepam tapering regime or diazepam only in response to withdrawal symptoms (symptom-triggered group). Results showed that there were no significant differences between treatment groups in terms of withdrawal severity, duration of in-patient treatment, amount of diazepam administered, treatment attrition and benzodiazepine use at follow-up. Both groups showed a reduction in benzodiazepine dosage of 86% over the first 8 days which was maintained at 1 month post-discharge. Although there were improvements in some subscales of the SF-36 between baseline and follow-up, values were significantly below age-matched norms at both time-points. This study showed that benzodiazepine users entering treatment have relatively poor health and that symptom-triggered taper methods incorporating flexible dosing and flexible treatment duration are as effective as fixed dose taper methods for in-patient benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment.", 
    "71": "Temazepam capsules have become a popular choice for benzodiazepine injection by injecting drug users, and serious vascular and tissue damage leading to ulcers and gangrene can result. We compared the self-reported benzodiazepine injecting behaviour of 91 heroin users with their Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (PBS) records for the preceding 5 years. We found that individuals prescribed PBS temazepam capsules were more likely to report injecting benzodiazepines than individuals who had either not been prescribed PBS temazepam capsules or had been prescribed PBS temazepam tablets. These results provide empirical support for the argument to limit the prescription and supply of temazepam capsules in Australia.", 
    "72": "The incidence of alcohol and drugs in fatally injured drivers were determined in three Australian states; Victoria (VIC), New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia (WA) for the period of 1990-1999. A total of 3398 driver fatalities were investigated which included 2609 car drivers, 650 motorcyclists and 139 truck drivers. Alcohol at or over 0.05 g/100ml (%) was present in 29.1% of all drivers. The highest prevalence was in car drivers (30.3%) and the lowest in truckers (8.6%). WA had the highest rate of alcohol presence of the three states (35.8%). Almost 10% of the cases involved both alcohol and drugs. Drugs (other than alcohol) were present in 26.7% of cases and psychotropic drugs in 23.5%. These drugs comprised cannabis (13.5%), opioids (4.9%), stimulants (4.1%), benzodiazepines (4.1%) and other psychotropic drugs (2.7%). 8.5% of all drivers tested positive for Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the balance of cannabis positive drivers were positive to only the 11-nor-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (carboxy-THC) metabolite. The range of THC blood concentrations in drivers was 0.1-228 ng/ml, with a median of 9 ng/ml. Opioids consisted mainly of morphine (n=84), codeine (n=89) and methadone (n=33), while stimulants consisted mainly of methamphetamine (n=51), MDMA (n=6), cocaine (n=5), and the ephedrines (n=61). The prevalence of drugs increased over the decade, particularly cannabis and opioids, while alcohol decreased. Cannabis had a larger prevalence in motorcyclists (22.2%), whereas stimulants had a much larger presence in truckers (23%).", 
    "73": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (Bzrp) has been implicated in the control of several processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis and embryo development. The present study examined the impact that specific Bzrp ligands have on oxygen homeostasis in the early mouse embryo. Day 9 embryos at the 16-18 somite pair stage were exposed to standard (21% oxygen) and suboptimal (5% oxygen) oxygen tensions in whole embryo culture. Analysis of gene expression used relative PCR to monitor changes in nuclear respiratory factor-1 (Nrf1), mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA), and genes for several glycolytic enzymes. Ocular development was highly sensitive to periods of hypoxia through a mechanism blocked with the potent Bzrp ligand PK11195. Hypoxia led to a decline of Nrf1 and 16S rRNA levels also through a mechanism blocked with PK11195. Similar activity was observed for FGIN-1-27 whereas Ro5-4864 had contradictory effects. Morpholino-based gene knockdown of Nrf1 (anti-NRF1) produced a sequence-specific decrease in 16S rRNA insensitive to PK11195. These functional relationships suggest that Bzrp-dependent signals regulate the Nrf1 --> Tfam1 --> mtDNA --> 16S rRNA pathway in response to oxygen levels. The activity of PK11195 most likely has a pharmacodynamic basis with regards to specific embryonic precursor target cell populations, transducing a mitochondrial signal to an Nrf1 response analogous to retrograde regulation in yeast for mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling.", 
    "74": "When prescribing drugs, the physician is responsible to warn his patient about potential impairment of driving capability. To do this, he needs to be aware of the duration and profile of actions, notably sedative and other effects affecting vigilance, cognitive and psychomotor functions. It is advisable to keep written records about such information. Impairment of driving capability may be more pronounced when ethanol is used during the action of drugs affecting central nervous function. The majority of published studies, particularly from epidemiological work with drivers, indicate an increased risk of accidents associated with the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines or cyclic antidepressants. Epidemiological data for other drugs available so far do not allow definite conclusions. Among antihistamines for drivers, loratadine or fexofenadine are probably preferable to ceritizine or older antihistamines. Patients with diabetes who drive should be informed about the risks and self-management of hypoglycaemia.", 
    "75": "Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like substances belong to the drugs prescribed and consumed most frequently. While acute toxicity is low in comparison to other hypnotics, physical and psychological dependence can develop during continuous ingestion of these drugs over months. Withdrawal symptoms can therefore develop, if the ingestion of these drugs is stopped abruptly. If a withdrawal of benzodiazepines is considered, this should be discussed in detail with the patient and be performed gradually over months. Faster withdrawals or withdrawal in polytoxicomanic patients should be performed in a specialized unit. After a successful withdrawal, patients should have psychological support in order to prevent relapses.", 
    "76": "In two patients, a man aged 54 years and a woman aged 49 years, stiff-person syndrome was diagnosed. This is a rare disorder of the central nervous system, with signs of an autoimmune pathogenesis. Patients present with pain and stiffness of the lower back, a complaint that is regularly seen in general practice. Moreover, the disease causes hypertonia and very painful cramps of the lower back and legs. Electromyographic examination in the resting condition reveals continuous muscle activity in the long back muscles, which decreases following the administration of diazepam. In 60% of patients, antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase may be found in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid; this enzyme is involved in the production of the inhibiting neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Both patients were treated with diazepam, baclofen and corticosteroids. Stiff-person syndrome is a rare but treatable disorder that should be considered when patients present with stiffness and pain in the lower back and upper legs.", 
    "77": "A major responsibility of the nurse anesthetist is providing adequate pain relief. Current research suggests that provider gender, as well as patient gender, may affect the clinical assessment and treatment of pain. Implications of the undertreatment of pain may be avoided if the anesthetist is aware of potential gender bias when approaching a given clinical situation. A postoperative pain scenario and questionnaire regarding proposed pain management was mailed to a random sample of 450 currently practicing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). Data were analyzed descriptively and qualitatively; 59 female and 74 male CRNAs responded (n = 133). Analgesic medication was used by 131 anesthetists; 124 of these used opiates. Significantly more male CRNAs (P < .05; chi 2) administered benzodiazepines along with the analgesic (21/74 [28%]) than did female CRNAs (11/59 [19%]); male CRNAs were more likely to administer benzodiazepines as part of their clinical management of cases involving males (13/38[34%]) than female patients (8/36 [22%]); however, this difference was not significant. Pain treatment strategies were indistinguishable between male and female anesthetists, as well as between male and female patients. However, gender-based differences in the use of sedation medication in concert with analgesic medication was an unexpected finding.",

A population analysis was conducted via a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model by the NPEM program. The final population model was used to generate individual Bayesian posterior pharmacokinetic parameter estimates. Total body clearance, apparent volume distribution in terminal phase, and plasma elimination half-life were (mean +/- sd, n = 18): 5.0 +/- 3.9 mL/kg/min, 1.7 +/- 1.1 L/kg, and 5.5 +/- 3.5 hrs, respectively. The mean 1-OH-midazolam/midazolam ratio and (1-OH-midazolam + 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide)/midazolam ratio were 0.14 +/- 0.21 and 1.4 +/- 1.1, respectively. Data from three patients with renal failure, hepatic failure, and concomitant erythromycin-fentanyl therapy were excluded from the final pharmacokinetic analysis.", 
    "84": "We describe population and individual midazolam pharmacokinetic parameter estimates in pediatric intensive care patients by using a population modeling approach. Lower midazolam elimination was observed in comparison to other studies in pediatric intensive care patients, probably as a result of differences in study design and patient differences such as age and disease state. Covariates such as renal failure, hepatic failure, and concomitant administration of CYP3A inhibitors are important predictors of altered midazolam and metabolite pharmacokinetics in pediatric intensive care patients. The derived population model can be useful for future dose optimization and Bayesian individualization.",

After oral administration, ximelagatran is rapidly absorbed and extensively bioconverted, via two intermediates (ethyl-melagatran and hydroxy-melagatran), to its active form, melagatran. In vitro studies have shown no evidence for involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in either the bioactivation or the elimination of melagatran.", 
    "87": "To investigate the potential of ximelagatran, the intermediates ethyl-melagatran and hydroxy-melagatran, and melagatran to inhibit the CYP system in vitro and in vivo, and the influence of three CYP substrates on the pharmacokinetics of melagatran in vivo.", 
    "88": "The CYP inhibitory properties of ximelagatran, the intermediates and melagatran were tested in vitro by two different methods, using heterologously expressed enzymes or human liver microsomes. Diclofenac (CYP2C9), diazepam (CYP2C19) and nifedipine (CYP3A4) were chosen for coadministration with ximelagatran in healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral ximelagatran 24mg and/or diclofenac 50mg, a 10-minute intravenous infusion of diazepam 0.1 mg/kg, or nifedipine 60mg. The plasma pharmacokinetics of melagatran, diclofenac, diazepam, N-desmethyl-diazepam and nifedipine were determined when administered alone and in combination with ximelagatran.", 
    "89": "No inhibition, or only minor inhibition, of CYP enzymes by ximelagatran, the intermediates or melagatran was shown in the in vitro studies, suggesting that ximelagatran would not cause CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions in vivo. This result was confirmed in the clinical studies. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac, diazepam and nifedipine on coadministration with ximelagatran. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of melagatran when ximelagatran was administered alone or in combination with diclofenac, diazepam or nifedipine.", 
    "90": "As ximelagatran did not exert a significant effect on the hepatic CYP isoenzymes responsible for the metabolism of diclofenac, diazepam and nifedipine, it is reasonable to expect that it would have no effect on the metabolism of other drugs metabolised by these isoenzymes. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of melagatran after oral administration of ximelagatran are not expected to be altered by inhibition or induction of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Together, the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that metabolic drug-drug interactions involving the major human CYP enzymes should not be expected with ximelagatran.", 
    "91": "Members of a homologous series of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) dimers with C8-O-(CH(2))(n)-O-C8' diether linkages (n = 3-6 for 2a-d, respectively) have been studied for their ability to interact with oligonucleotide duplexes containing potential target binding sites. The results confirm earlier predictions that the n = 3 analogue (2a, DSB-120) will covalently bind to a 5'-Pu-GATC-Py sequence by cross-linking opposite-strand guanines separated by 2 bp. Preference for this DNA sequence is shown using oligonucleotides with altered bases between and/or flanking these guanines. The more extended PBD dimer 2c (n = 5) can span an extra base pair and cross-link the 5'-Pu-GA(T/A)TC-Py sequence. The ability of each homologue to cross-link linear plasmid DNA has been determined, with a rank order that correlates with the reported order of in vitro cytotoxicity: n = 3 (2a) > n = 5 (2c) > n = 6 (2d) > n = 4 (2b). The n = 3 homologue (2a) is >300-fold more efficient at cross-linking DNA than the clinically used cross-linking agent melphalan under the same conditions. Kinetic studies reveal that the n = 3 and 5 dimers achieve faster cross-linking to plasmid DNA (108 and 81% cross-linking h(-1) microM(-1) at 37 degrees C, respectively), whereas the n = 4 and 6 homologues are significantly less efficient at 10.3 and 23% cross-linking h(-1) microM(-1), respectively. Alternating activity for the odd n and even n dimers is probably due to configurational factors governed by the spatial separation of the PBD subunits and the flexible character of the tethering linkage. Molecular modeling confirms the order of cross-linking reactivity, and highlights the role of linker length in dictating sequence recognition for this class of DNA-reactive agent.",

Such data would be of great importance to law enforcement agencies trying to determine the best time interval for urine collection from a victim of drug-facilitated sexual assault in order to reveal drug use. A highly sensitive NCI-GC-MS method for the simultaneous quantitation of CLO and its major metabolite 7-ACLO in urine was developed and validated. The following urine samples were collected from each volunteer: one before CLO administration, and 6 h, and 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days after. All urine samples (1 mL) were extracted following addition of the internal standard (D(5)-diazepam) and enzymatic hydrolysis ( beta-glucuronidase) using solid-phase extraction columns. Standard curves for CLO (500-4000 pg x mL(-1)) and 7-ACLO (50-2000 pg x mL(-1)) were prepared by spiking aliquots of negative urine. The urine from every subject was still positive for 7-ACLO 14 days after administration of the drug. Eight of the ten volunteers had measurable amounts of the metabolite 21 days after administration. One volunteer was still positive 28 days after administration. Six of the volunteers had urine concentrations of 7-ACLO that peaked at 1 day after administration. One volunteer had the highest concentration of 7-ACLO at 3 days, two volunteers at 5 days, and one at 8 days. The range of concentrations detected was from 73.0 pg x mL(-1) to 183.2 ng x mL(-1).

    "116": "Given the diversity of clinical entities from which agitation may arise, it is not surprising that it is among the most commonly encountered clinical problems in psychiatric facilities and hospital emergency services. However, quite surprisingly this area has received very little attention and has not been studied in clinical trials until recently. Thus, tremendous variability exists in approaches to agitation. In this work, we review what is known about the pharmacologic management of agitation; first, by examining published studies comparing conventional antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and/or a combination of both to achieve calm in acutely agitated psychiatric patients; and second, by reviewing available data on the use of atypical antipsychotic medications for the acute treatment of agitation associated with psychiatric illness. In our first review, we identified 11 trials meeting our inclusion criteria, 8 with a blind design. These studies taken together suggest that combination treatment may be superior to either agent alone, with higher improvement rates and lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. In our review of atypical antipsychotic agents as acute antiagitation compounds, we identified 5 studies, 3 with a blind design. This review found atypical antipsychotics to be as effective as the classical ones and more advantageous. Based on the data available to date, among the present novel antipsychotic agents, ziprasidone, risperidone, and olanzapine seem to be the best acute antiagitation compounds.",

The objective of this study was to characterise cubosomes as either a therapeutically useful, controlled release delivery system, or as a burst release carrier such as submicron emulsions. The pressure ultrafiltration method and equilibrium dialysis were used to elucidate the in vitro drug release mechanisms. On dilution of cubosomes, lipophilic compounds were released rapidly when studied by the pressure ultrafiltration method. This agrees with the behaviour predicted from simple diffusion from the bulk non-dispersed cubic phase. In contrast, equilibrium dialysis incorrectly indicated sustained drug release from cubosomes. This study illustrates that cubosomes should be classified as a burst release delivery system where drug is released by diffusion from the cubic phase matrix, and that pressure ultrafiltration may have benefits over dialysis methods for measurement of drug release from colloidal particle-based drug delivery systems.",

The present study was undertaken to address the functional consequences of bilateral entorhinal cortex lesions on antipsychotic-induced c-fos expression. After a 15-day recovery period, the effect of a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol (1 mg/kg), on c-fos mRNA expression was compared with that of an atypical one, olanzapine (10 mg/kg), in both sham-lesioned and entorhinal cortex-lesioned rats. In sham-lesioned rats, both haloperidol and olanzapine induced c-fos expression in the caudal cingulate cortex, dorsomedial and dorsolateral caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens core and shell and lateral septum. In addition, olanzapine, but not haloperidol, increased c-fos expression within the central amygdala. In entorhinal cortex-lesioned rats, haloperidol-induced c-fos expression was markedly reduced in most areas. In contrast, the olanzapine-induced c-fos expression was not altered in the nucleus accumbens shell and lateral septum of the lesioned rats. These findings reveal that entorhinal cortex lesions affect c-fos expression in a compound- and regional-dependent manner. Our results further emphasize the importance of the exploration of the mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs in the context of an associated cortical pathology.", 
    "125": "The aim of the study was to assess the performance of a bayesian program (PKS System, Abbott) for predicting midazolam concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters in intensive care patients by comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by PKS to those calculated according to rich data. The study involved 42 patients receiving midazolam infusion for two hours or for several days. The program was used to predict plasma midazolam concentrations after feedback of 1, 2 or 3 concentrations. High correlation between observed and estimated concentrations was shown (r(2) > 0.992). Mean prediction error, mean absolute prediction error and root mean squared error were low for the patients of the reference and validation groups. From two or three feedback concentrations, midazolam pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by PKS were statistically comparable with those obtained using a rich pharmacokinetic analysis (P > 0.05 paired Wilcoxon test). Thus, PKS is useful for predicting midazolam concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters when at least two feedback concentrations are known. This software seems to be appropriate for providing significant help to the clinician for midazolam dosage adjustment, according to midazolam concentrations and clinical sedation.", 
    "126": "The objective of this research was to develop a method to characterize the degree of particle agglomeration using laser diffraction particle sizing, following the addition of benzodiazepine interactive mixtures to water. Interactive mixtures of diazepam, nitrazepam and oxazepam (up to 20% w/w) were prepared by mixing micronized benzodiazepines with lactose granules (250-355 microm). Micronized sodium lauryl sulfate and cetrimide (up to 5% w/w) were added to the benzodiazepine-lactose interactive mixes to produce ternary mixtures. Particle size distributions of benzodiazepines, after addition of the interactive mixtures to water, were determined using laser diffraction particle sizing. Bimodal distributions representing dispersed particles and agglomerates were observed initially after lactose carrier dissolution. Partial agglomerate to dispersed particle transition occurred during a 60-min observation period for all mixtures, reaching a constant level of agglomeration after this time. Interactive mixtures with higher benzodiazepine concentrations displayed transition profiles with higher levels of agglomeration. The presence of surfactant in interactive mixtures dramatically decreased agglomeration. Sodium lauryl sulfate was more effective than cetrimide in dispersing agglomerates. The shape of the transition curves during de-agglomeration demonstrated the presence of stable agglomerates that remained after the initial transition; these may be important in explaining dissolution and absorption rates.",

Two groups of aortic rings removed from albinic rabbits anesthetized with thiopental were used (Group I-6 animals; Group II-12 animals), stripped of endothelium, studied in an organ chamber, perfused by Krebs-Henseleit solution. The groups were stimulated by adrenaline, recording the maximum contraction and dT/dt at 12\", 36\", 60\" and 120\". When the plateau phase was reached, the vessel was washed with perfusion solution, recording relaxation at 2', 4' and 6'. When the base values were reached, Group I underwent a new adrenergic stimulus; and Group II was stimulated with midazolam and then with adrenaline, and the same values were recorded. T test was applied as a statistical analysis when two variables were studied. When studying more than two variables the Anova test was used, supplemented by the Tuckey test. Group I did not show any significant difference between the two stimuli. Group II--the midazolam significantly reduced the maximum contraction induced by adrenaline (83.01 +/- 4.11%) (p < 0.01). The dT/dt was reduced at 12\" (57.06 +/- 8.47%), and also at 36\" (70.59 +/- 5.26%). There was no significance at 60\" and 120\" (p < 0.01).

    "133": "The hypothesis of these studies was that all fats and carbohydrates suppress food intake, at least in part, via cholecystokinin-A receptors (CCKAR). Fat (coconut oil, beef tallow, olive and safflower oil) and carbohydrate (cornstarch, sucrose, glucose and fructose) preloads were given intragastrically (1 g/4 mL) 30 min before feeding. Devazepide (0.25 mg/kg), a CCKAR antagonist, was given intraperitoneally at 60 or 30 min before or with each of the macronutrient preloads. Devazepide reversed food intake suppression caused by all fat and carbohydrate sources, but the effect was not consistently related to the time of devazepide administration or to any specific feeding interval. Among the fats, coconut and olive oil were most responsive to devazepide. The effect of all carbohydrates on food intake was decreased by devazepide. We conclude that CCKAR play a role in food intake suppression caused by all fats and carbohydrates, but their role is dependent upon the composition of the fat or carbohydrate.", 
    "134": "In recent years genotoxicity testing has become more and more important in the process of early screening for potential development compounds. In the case that a pharmacologically interesting structure is found to be positive in an in vitro mutagenicity test a straightforward approach starts by sorting out what substructure is responsible for the activity observed in the test. The Ames test is a rapid, convenient test system which has been effectively used in structure-activity relationship studies for mutagenicity, since it can rapidly establish differences in the mutagenic action of isomers and chemical analogs. The lead compound with a benzodiazepine-like structure and close analogs exhibited weak, but unequivocal positive effects in the Ames test (strains TA1535 and TA 100) after metabolic activation by rat liver homogenate fraction (S9). To identify substances within this class of compounds devoid of mutagenic liability an extensive structure-activity investigation was undertaken. More than 50 compounds were tested in the two critical bacterial strains, using a standard plate incorporation and a preincubation modification. It quickly became evident that the benzodiazepine structure was not involved. First hints that the allyl side chain were responsible for the Ames activity had to be refined in a more complex, but clear-cut structure-activity relationship during the course of the experiments. It was shown that all compounds with an allyl side chain, independent of the heterocycle, but surprisingly also all compounds with a specific arrangement of the heteroatoms in the oxadiazole ring, showed positive effects in at least one strain. Based on these investigations it was possible to select pharmacologically active structures without mutagenic liability.",

A two-step survey was applied. Data on basic demographics were collected, the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ), Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST), Drug Abuse Screen Test (DAST) questionnaires were administered and urine drug screening for amphetamine and benzodiazepines was performed in all subjects. Subjects with MAST scores > or =3, DAST > or =5 from both groups and CHQ > or =4 for the GED group and CHQ > or =7 for the SED group were regarded as a high-risk group; and subjects with normal MAST, DAST and CHQ results serving as the comparison group were invited for further interview by psychiatric specialists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The mean CHQ scores were 0.94 +/- 1.53 for the GED group and 2.08 +/- 2.42 for the SED group. The mean MAST scores for the GED and SED groups were 0.23 +/- 0.58 and 0.38 +/- 1.12; and the mean DAST scores were 1.03 +/- 0.85 and 1.41 +/- 1.89, respectively. The positive rate for benzodiazepines in urine screening by enzyme immunoassay was 8.3% for the GED group, and 8.5% for the SED group. After specification using liquid chromatography, this rate reduced to 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively. Only one subject in the SED group tested positive for urine amphetamine. The SED group had a higher rate of neurotic problems, psychiatric diagnosis and a higher frequency of substance use than the GED group. These findings suggest that different work style of commercial drivers may contribute to this phenomenon. The rate of psychiatric diagnosis was significantly higher in the high-risk subjects from both groups.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are better tolerated for long-term therapy than traditional medications and may contribute to a lower rehospitalization risk, but have not been compared to depot forms with regard to long-term outcomes. This study evaluates the risk of readmission in patients discharged from six State of Maryland inpatient mental health facilities between Jan. 1, 1997 and Dec. 31, 1997 on clozapine (N = 41), risperidone (N = 149), and olanzapine (N = 103). These patients were compared with those discharged from the two largest state facilities during the same time period on fluphenazine decanoate (N = 59) or haloperidol decanoate (N = 59). One-year readmission risk (measured by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Holm's adjustment for multiple comparison on Log Rank tests) were 10% for clozapine, 12% for risperidone, and 13% for olanzapine. These risks were not significantly lower than the readmission risk for fluphenazine decanoate (21%) but were significantly lower than haloperidol decanoate (35%) for all three SGAs. Demographic and clinical variables did not predict readmission for any of the medications. In patients with similar demographic and clinical characteristics, 1-year risk of readmission for patients treated with SGAs were at least comparable to the 1-year risk for patients receiving fluphenazine decanoate and lower than the risk for patients treated with haloperidol decanoate.

    "141": "Acetaldehyde has been suggested to mediate a number of the pharmacological and behavioural effects of ethanol. Recently, several studies investigated the role of acetaldehyde in the subjective effects of ethanol, but obtained conflicting results. With the discriminative taste aversion (DTA) procedure, high acetaldehyde doses were shown to substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. In contrast, the operant drug discrimination protocol failed to show any substitution effect of acetaldehyde. Several methodological differences between the two procedures could explain these discrepancies, and particularly the absence of an individual discrimination criterion in the DTA procedure. In the present study, the DTA procedure was adapted to introduce such a criterion. In addition, the effects of acetaldehyde were compared with those of other drugs, for which the substitution effects for ethanol are well known. Rats were trained to discriminate 1.0 g/kg ethanol from saline in a DTA protocol. When the rats met the criterion of ethanol discrimination, various doses of several drugs were tested for their ethanol stimulus substitution effects: ethanol, acetaldehyde, dizocilpine, diazepam and nicotine. The results showed a clear dose-dependent discrimination of ethanol stimulus effects. In addition, dizocilpine fully substituted for ethanol, while diazepam only partially substituted. In contrast, both acetaldehyde and nicotine failed to substitute for ethanol. These results show that acetaldehyde is not significantly involved in the subjective and discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. Acetaldehyde up to toxic doses did not substitute for the ethanol discriminative stimulus in the DTA protocol, when non-specific effects were carefully controlled.", 
    "142": "Physical dependence on diazepam was evaluated in male baboons chronically treated with either low or high doses of diazepam. Baboons received either a single oral daily administration of a low dose (0.5 mg/kg per day) of diazepam (n=4) or continuous intragastric infusion of a high dose (20 mg/kg per day) of diazepam (n=7). Development of physical dependence during chronic dosing with 0.5 mg/kg per day diazepam was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks and then monthly, during 1-h behavioral observations, following injections of the benzodiazepine competitive antagonist flumazenil. After 3-24 months of diazepam treatment, dosing was discontinued and physical dependence assessed via observation and responding for food pellets. In baboons that received 0.5 mg/kg per day diazepam, flumazenil precipitated a mild- to intermediate-intensity benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which included decreases in the number of food pellets earned per day and increases in withdrawal postures, self-directed behaviors, aggressive behaviors and retching/vomiting. Three of four baboons showed signs of precipitated withdrawal after only 2 weeks of chronic low-dose treatment. Flumazenil continued to precipitate withdrawal signs, but with no systematic increase in severity, throughout the 6-10 months of 0.5 mg/kg diazepam administration. When 0.5 mg/kg per day diazepam dosing was discontinued, the number of food pellets earned per day decreased in two of the four baboons, but no systematic changes in behavioral signs were observed. In contrast, within 7-10 days of termination of 20 mg/kg per day diazepam dosing, withdrawal signs of intermediate intensity and a decrease in the number of food pellets earned per day occurred in all baboons. In the present study, physical dependence developed after 2 weeks of a chronic low dose of diazepam administration but did not increase further over long-term exposure to diazepam.", 
    "143": "Response rates in variable-interval intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in rats can provide a continuous record of drug-induced changes in brain function. Use of this procedure has been found to distinguish between typical and atypical neuroleptics, with the latter producing a similarly intense but much briefer depression of responding. This difference has been ascribed to the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist properties of atypical neuroleptics, but the evidence is ambiguous. The role of alpha2-adrenoceptors was examined in the present study using ventral tegmental ICSS to track the depressant effects of the typical and atypical neuroleptics, haloperidol (0.075 mg/kg) and olanzapine (0.9 mg/kg), injected alone or in combination with an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist or antagonist. Neither haloperidol nor olanzapine (despite its atypical features) shows appreciable affinity for the alpha2-adrenoceptor. In the present study, olanzapine was found to depress self-stimulation responding dose-dependently, but with considerable recovery after 4 h. Simultaneous administration of alpha2-adrenoceptor receptor agonists or antagonists (respectively clonidine 0.015 mg/kg or idazoxan 3.0 mg/kg) failed significantly to increase or decrease the action of either haloperidol or olanzapine. These results indicate that alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonism does not necessarily promote recovery from neuroleptic-induced depression, and that 'atypical' features do not necessarily depend on alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonism. Various other explanations remain possible, but the accelerated time course of the atypical agents appears to support more recent explanations, based on their rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor.",

    "145": "We conducted a prospective, partially-blinded controlled comparative trial comparing intravenous P/F with K/M in a convenience sample of 113 patients aged 3 to 18 years old undergoing orthopedic procedural sedation. All medications were administered by the intermittent intravenous bolus method. An independent sedation nurse recorded total sedation time and RT. Effectiveness was measured using 6 parameters: 1) patient distress as assessed by independent blinded observers after videotape review using the OSBD-r; 2) orthopedic satisfaction score (Likert scale 1-5); 3) sedation nurse satisfaction score (Likert 1-5); 4) parental perception of procedural pain using a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analog Scale with the upper limit being \"most pain\"; 5) patient recall of the procedure; and 6) 1 to 3 week follow-up.", 
    "146": "RT and total sedation time were significantly less in the P/F group than in the K/M group (33.4 minutes vs 23.2 minutes). The mean OSBD-r scores during manipulation were 0.084 and 0.278 for the K/M and P/F groups, respectively. Although this difference was statistically significant (95% confidence interval for the mean difference -0.34 to -0.048), both regimens were successful in keeping the scores low. There was no statistical difference between the groups in the other measures of effectiveness. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in the occurrence of desaturation and late side effects.",

Treatment intensity, as measured by visit frequency and duration of treatment, were more intense than typically found in primary care. Most patients received a combination of medication management and psychotherapy.

    "152": "The pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam (MDZ) and its major metabolites 1'-OH-midazolam (1'OH-MDZ) and 4-OH-midazolam (4OH-MDZ) was investigated in rats. MDZ was administered intravenously at 5 mg/kg either in the absence (NaCl 0.9%, control group) or in the presence of the surfactant Solutol HS 15, a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity in vitro (Solutol HS 15-treated group). It was found that the pharmacokinetic profiles of MDZ, 1'OH-MDZ and 4OH MDZ did not differ significantly in the two dosing vehicles (P values above 0.2). MDZ exhibited a high plasma clearance (Cl) of 79 and 92 ml/min/kg (corresponding to a blood Cl of 64 and 75 ml/min/kg), a high volume of distribution (V(d)) of 4.0 and 3.6 l/kg, and an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(t0-tinf)) of 1062 and 932 h.ng/ml in the control group and in the Solutol HS 15-treated group, respectively. The amount of MDZ excreted unchanged into urine was below 0.01% with both dosing vehicles. AUC(t0-tinf) in the control group was 12.3 h.ng/ml for 1'OH-MDZ and 38.8 h.ng/ml 4OH-MDZ. In the Solutol HS 15-treated group, AUC(t0-tinf) was 14 h.ng/ml for 1'OH-MDZ and 35.4 h.ng/ml for 4OH-MDZ. The metabolite concentrations excreted into urine were below the limit of quantification. In the rat, MDZ has a high blood clearance that is limited by liver blood flow. Therefore, weak CYP3A inhibitors like Solutol HS 15 are not likely to affect the hepatic blood clearance of MDZ in vivo.",

To assess post-hoc the effects of prolactin concentrations upon switching to olanzapine treatment, patients were divided into three different groups, based upon status at time of consent: those not taking antipsychotic medication, those taking any conventional antipsychotic, and those taking risperidone. Prolactin concentrations were assessed using a mixed-effect repeated-measures model. Symptom severity was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the same repeated measures analysis was performed on these scales.", 
    "155": "Patients not on antipsychotic medication at study entry (29 females, 7 males) experienced a significant increase in prolactin concentration baseline to endpoint (P < 0.05) but remained below upper limit of normal for prolactin for both males and females.

Patients who entered the study on risperidone (mean dose 1.31 +/- 0.91 mg/day) (13 females, 4 males) experienced a significant decrease in prolactin concentration (P < 0.001). While 62.5% of risperidone-treated patients had above-normal prolactin concentrations at baseline, only 21.4% had above-normal concentrations at endpoint (P = 0.033).

In addition, patients who were receiving risperidone and then switched to olanzapine experienced a significant reduction in prolactin concentrations that was sustained over the 8-week treatment course with olanzapine. One possible explanation for olanzapine's relatively modest increase in prolactin is that, unlike conventionals or risperidone, olanzapine binds less tightly with the dopamine D(2) receptor.",

The experience in this paper is not sufficient evidence to recommend the wholesale use of intravenous conscious sedation in patients who are under 16 years. The fact that a range of operators can use these techniques on paediatric patients would suggest that further study should be carried out in this population. The guidance should be modified to say there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous conscious sedation in children, rather than arbitrarily selecting a cut off point at age 16 years.",

We investigated the effects of 24 h glutamate exposure on transglutaminase in astrocytes primary cultures at 7, 14, and 21 days in vitro (DIV). Increases in enzyme activity were observed as a function of cell differentiation stage in glutamate-treated cultures. These effects were significantly reduced when GYKI 52466, an AMPA/KA receptors inhibitor, was added to the culture medium prior to incubation with glutamate. Microscopy observation on transglutaminase-mediated, fluorescent dansylcadaverine incorporation in living cells was consistent with these results. Western blotting analysis with monoclonal antibody showed that glutamate also up-regulated tissue transglutaminase expression, which reached the highest values in 14 DIV cultures. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of immunostained astroglial cells showed a mainly cytoplasmic localisation of the enzyme both in control and treated cultures; nevertheless, counterstaining with the nuclear dye acridine orange demonstrated the presence of tissue transglutaminase also into the nucleus of glutamate-exposed and 21 DIV cells. The increases in enzyme expression and localisation in the nucleus of glutamate-treated astroglial cells may be part of biochemical alterations induced by excitotoxic stimulus.",

The search for the mechanism underlying this core of symptoms led us to investigate impairments in multisensory integration. In mice, the 'rotating beam test' allows analysis of changes in balance control and posture in response to a multisensory challenge. We used the BALB/c and C57BL/6 inbred strains of mice, known for their contrasted anxiety-related behavior. The level of anxiety was also manipulated using anxiolytic and anxiogenic pharmacological compounds. Despite equal sensori-motor abilities, anxious mice were more prone to fall off the rotating beam and showed more imbalance than non-anxious mice. Striking inter-strain differences in posture were also observed. Diazepam and beta-CCM reversed these strain-specific responses in opposite directions. We demonstrated that balance and postural strategies developed in response to a multisensory challenge vary as a function of the level of anxiety in mice.",

    "180": "Soman, a powerful inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, causes an array of toxic effects in the central nervous system including convulsions, learning and memory impairments, and, ultimately, death. We report on the protection afforded by postexposure antidotal treatments, combined with pyridostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) pretreatment, against these consequences associated with soman poisoning. Scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg) or caramiphen (10 mg/kg) were administered 5 min after soman (1.2 LD50), whereas TAB (i.e., TMB4, atropine, and benactyzine, 7.5, 3, and 1 mg/kg, respectively) was injected in rats concomitant with the development of toxic signs. Atropine (4 mg/kg) was given to the two former groups at the onset of toxic symptoms. Caramiphen and TAB completely abolished electrographic seizure activity while scopolamine treatment exhibited only partial protection. Additionally, no significant alteration in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was noted following caramiphen or TAB administration, while scopolamine application resulted in a complex outcome: a portion of the animals demonstrated no change in the number of these sites whereas the others exhibited markedly higher densities. Cognitive functions (i.e., learning and memory processes) evaluated using the Morris water maze improved considerably by the three treatments when compared to soman-injected animals; the following rank order was observed: caramiphen > TAB > scopolamine. Additionally, statistically significant correlations (r = 0.72, r = 0.73) were demonstrated between two learning parameters and [3H]Ro5-4864 binding to brain membrane. These results show that drugs with a pharmacological profile consisting of anticholinergic and antiglutamatergic properties such as caramiphen and TAB, have a substantial potential as postexposure therapies against intoxication by organophosphates."
