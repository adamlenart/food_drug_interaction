    "1": "A retrospective analysis of 16 705 patient care records completed by ambulance paramedics in Melbourne where medications had a causal role in the attendance.", 
    "2": "A single medication only was implicated in 11 765 cases (70% of the total). Of these, 85% involved one of six types of medication: benzodiazepines (52%), paracetamol (15%), selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (6.5%), combination paracetamol and opioids (4%), phenothiazines (3.4%) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) (3.7%). Cases involving benzodiazepines were significantly (P < 0.001) older (Average = 37 years) than those involving paracetamol (Average = 30 years). Thirty-four per cent of cases involved concurrent alcohol use, and this varied according to drug type (paracetamol 26%, benzodiazepines 40%, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors 35%, paracetamol and opioids 35%). An abnormal Glasgow Coma Scale score was found in 19% of cases, again varying according to drug type (paracetamol 10%, TCA 39%, benzodiazepines 21%, paracetamol and opioids 17%, phenothiazines 15%). Ten per cent of cases were not transported to hospital ranging from 3% for TCA to 13% for benzodiazepines.", 
    "3": "The majority of non-fatal medication events attended by ambulance paramedics involve one of six substances. Benzodiazepines were most commonly implicated and, as management may require only simple supportive treatment, significant numbers are not transported to hospital. The unique clinical population is identified in this study and the ongoing medical and psychiatric treatment of these patients not transported to hospital in the study period needs to be considered.", 
    "4": "The aim of this trial was to compare lorazepam with non-benzodiazepine medications such as pregabalin and tiapride in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). These drugs were chosen for their inhibitorial effects on the hypersecretion of neurotransmitters usually observed in AWS. Craving reduction and improvement of psychiatric symptoms were the secondary end-points.", 
    "5": "One hundred and ninety subjects affected by current alcohol dependence were considered consecutively: 111 were enrolled and divided into three groups of 37 subjects each. Within a treatment duration of 14 days, medication was given up to the following maximum doses (pregabalin 450 mg/day; tiapride 800 mg/day; lorazepam 10 mg/day). Withdrawal (CIWA-Ar), craving [visual analogue scale (VAS); Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS)], psychiatric symptoms [Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)] and quality of life (QL-index) rating scales were applied.", 
    "6": "On the CIWA-Ar score, all the groups showed a significant reduction between times (P < 0.001) with a higher reduction for the pregabalin group (P < 0.01) on items regarding headache and orientation. Retention in treatment was lower in the tiapride group (P < 0.05), while the number of subjects remaining alcohol free was higher in the pregabalin group (P < 0.05). Significant reduction between baseline and the end of the treatment was found in all the groups at the OCDS and the VAS for craving, at the SCL-90-R and QL-index (P < 0.001).", 
    "7": "All the medications in the trial showed evidence of safety and efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated forms of AWS, with some particular differences. The efficacy of pregabalin was superior to that of tiapride, used largely in research trials and, for some measures, to that of the 'gold standard', lorazepam. Accordingly, pregabalin may be considered as a potentially useful new drug for treatment of AWS, deserving further investigation.", 
    "8": "Standard measures of dyspnea rely on self-report. Cognitive impairment and nearness to death may interfere with symptom distress reporting leading to underrecognition and overtreatment or undertreatment. Previous psychometric testing of the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS) demonstrated internal consistency and convergent validity with dyspnea self-report and discriminant validity with pain and no dyspnea. Additional testing was needed with patients unable to self-report. The aim of this study was to establish further the reliability and construct validity of a revised RDOS.", 
    "9": "An observational design was used with 89 consecutive patients referred for inpatient palliative care consultation and at risk for dyspnea who had one or more of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, or pneumonia. Patients were observed and the RDOS scored once each day for up to three days after the initial consultation. Other measures included: dyspnea self-report, neurologic diagnoses, opioid or benzodiazepine use, peripheral oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide level, consciousness, cognitive state, nearness to death, and patient demographics.", 
    "10": "Perfect interrater reliability across data collectors was achieved. No differences in RDOS scoring were found by patient demographics. RDOS was associated with use of oxygen (p < 0.01), oxygen saturation (p < 0.01) and nearness to death (p < 0.01). A significant decrease in RDOS was found over time corresponding with treatment (p < 0.01). The reliability of this 8-item scale using Cronbach alpha is 0.64.", 
    "11": "Declining consciousness and/or cognition are expected when patients are near death. The RDOS performed well when tested with terminally ill patients who were at risk for respiratory distress, most of whom could not self-report dyspnea. The tool is sensitive to detect changes over time and measure response to treatment. The RDOS is simple to use; scoring takes less than 5 minutes. The RDOS has clinical and research utility to measure and trend respiratory distress and response to treatment.", 
    "12": "The benzodiazepines are a large, commonly prescribed family of psychoactive drugs. We describe a method permitting the simultaneous detection and quantification of 12 benzodiazepines in serum using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Analytes included alprazolam, temazepam, oxazepam, nordiazepam, clonazepam, lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, midazolam, flunitrazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, and 7-aminoflunitrazepam. Sample pretreatment is simple consisting of protein precipitation using cold acetonitrile (ACN) mixed with the deuterated internal standards. Samples were capped and vortexed for 5 min to ensure maximum precipitation. Following a 5-min centrifugation period, 400 microL of the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and evaporated down under nitrogen. Samples were reconstituted in 200 microL of a deionized water:ACN (80:20) mixture and transferred to appropriate vials for analysis. Chromatographic run time was 7.5 min, and the 12 analytes were quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and 6-point calibration curves constructed for each analyte at concentrations covering a clinically significant range.", 
    "13": "We describe a single method for the detection and quantitation of 13 commonly prescribed benzodiazepines and metabolites: alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, alpha-hydroxyethylflurazepam, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, alprazolam, desalkylflurazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, clonazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam in urine, serum, plasma, and meconium. The urine and meconium specimens undergo enzyme hydrolysis to convert the compounds of interest to their free form. All specimens are prepared for analysis using solid-phase extraction (SPE), analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and quantified using a three-point calibration curve. Deuterated analogs of all 13 analytes are included as internal standards. The instrument is operated in multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive ionization mode. Urine and meconium specimens have matrix-matched calibrators and controls. The serum and plasma specimens are quantified using the urine calibrators but employing plasma-based controls. Oxazepam glucuronide is used as a hydrolysis control.", 
    "14": "The benzodiazepine assay utilizes gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the analysis of diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, and alpha-hydroxytriazolam in blood and urine. A separate assay is employed for the analysis of alprazolam. Prior to solid phase extraction, urine specimens are subjected to enzyme hydrolysis. The specimens are fortified with deuterated internal standard and a five-point calibration curve is constructed. Specimens are extracted by mixed-mode solid phase extraction. The benzodiazepine extracts are derivatized with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MTBSFTA) producing tert-butyldimethyl silyl derivatives; the alprazolam extracts are reconstituted in methanol without derivatization. The final extracts are then analyzed using selected ion monitoring GC-MS.", 
    "15": "The newer atypical antipsychotics seem to be as effective as previous antipsychotics for impulsivity and aggressiveness of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Objective of this assessment was to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine versus haloperidol in BPD.", 
    "16": "Twenty-eight female inpatients, meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for BPD, were randomly entered in one of the 2 matching contemporaneous groups for an 8-week parallel double-blind study. This included the random assignment to olanzapine or haloperidol in a 1:1 ratio. Primary outcome measurements were as follows: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. Baselines were created at the beginning of the trial through patient assessments and final assessments at the end of the experiment. Analysis of effect size, calculation of confidence intervals and power analysis were also prepared.", 
    "17": "All of the patients from within both groups completed the study. Intragroup analysis at the eighth week interval revealed significant positive response by both olanzapine and haloperidol in comparison with the baseline (P < 0.05); however, the between-group analysis showed no significant difference, among the patients, at the end of the experiment. The analysis of specific Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale subscales in both groups revealed considerable and comparable improvements in anxiety, tension, depressive mood, and hostility. The effect size analyzes illustrated remarkable improvements with both groups.", 
    "18": "There seems to be no significant difference between olanzapine and haloperidol regarding the management of mental and behavioral symptoms of patients with BPD.", 
    "19": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common debilitating psychiatric illness that typically improves but does not remit with first-line medication and behavioral treatments. Serotonergic agents including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and clomipramine have provided the mainstay of OCD medication management for decades. Combined dopamine/serotonergic agents such as atypical antipsychotics are presently the only OCD-augmenting strategies proven effective via randomized controlled trials. Despite increasing evidence for a pathogenic role of glutamate in OCD, no controlled trials of glutamatergic augmenting agents have been reported.", 
    "20": "An intent-to-treat sample included 44 subjects receiving standard treatment at the McLean/Massachusetts General Hospital Intensive Residential Treatment (IRT) program, 22 of whom also received memantine augmentation. Admission, monthly and discharge measures of OCD, depression, and psychosocial functioning were collected by raters blinded to augmentation status. Matched controls were selected based on sex, initial OCD severity, psychosocial functioning, and timing of admission. The Clinical Global Improvement Scale captured global clinical change.", 
    "21": "Mean (SD) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decreases were 7.2 (6.4) among the cases and 4.6 (5.9) among the matched controls, reflecting mean clinical improvement among the cases (27.0% decrease) but not the controls (16.5% decrease). Mean (SD) depression severity score decreases were 5.8 (9.5) among the cases and 4.7 (9.9) among the controls. Initial intrusive obsessions were significantly more severe among marked responders compared with limited response or nonresponse cases (4.4 vs 2.9; t = 2.15; P = 0.048).", 
    "22": "This study provides preliminary supportive evidence for the effectiveness of memantine as a glutamatergic augmenting agent in severe OCD. Future randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted.", 
    "23": "Neuroleptic-induced catatonia (NIC), manifested in an extrapyramidal-catatonic syndrome, has been sporadically reported in the literature. Confusion surrounds its relationship to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and extrapyramidal reactions to neuroleptics. This study examined (a) its clinical presentation and response to benzodiazepines, (b) the hypothesis that NIC and NMS are on the same spectrum with a continuum of symptom progression, and (c) its possible relationship to extrapyramidal reactions. Of 127 episodes of acute catatonia prospectively identified, 18 were diagnosed with NIC. All catatonia episodes received benzodiazepines. The NIC episodes were analyzed noting their clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and responses to treatments. Their responses to benzodiazepines were compared, with retrospective rating on a 7-point scale, to that for catatonia episodes associated with mania and schizophrenia. The progression of symptoms in each NIC episode was reviewed. The NIC episodes presented predominantly in the stuporous form associated with parkinsonism. Delirium, autonomic abnormality, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase were all common. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was diagnosed in 3 episodes (17%). The 3 catatonia groups did not differ significantly in their benzodiazepines responses: 78% (14/18) of NIC, 75% (12/16) of manic catatonia, and 67% (34/51) of schizophrenic catatonia episodes showed full responses. A spectrum of presentation across episodes was noted with simple NIC without delirium, autonomic disturbances, or fever at one end and NMS or malignant NIC at the other end. Symptoms in individual episodes showed a similar continuum progression. No extrapyramidal reactions immediately preceded the NIC episodes. Findings of this study support the hypothesis that NIC and NMS are disorders on the same spectrum and reveal no indication that extrapyramidal reactions progress to NIC.", 
    "24": "Opisthotonus is known to occur in tetanus, rabies, cerebral malaria, neurosyphilis, acute cerebral injury and other medical conditions. Opisthotonus, so far, has not been reported in any major psychiatric disorder. Authors report a case of recurrent opisthotonus presenting concurrently with other catatonic signs which showed dramatic response to combination of lorazepam and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Clinicians should consider the possibility of catatonia in the differential diagnosis of opisthotonus since catatonia can be treated easily with benzodiazepines and ECT.", 
    "25": "This study was carried out to compare the efficacy of intravenous sodium valproate with intramuscular haloperidol in patients with acute mania. A total of 30 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for acute manic episodes were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to 2 groups of 15 patients each. Both groups were treated twice daily with haloperidol (10 mg, intramuscular) and sodium valproate (500 mg, intravenous). The patients were assessed on days 1, 5, 9, and 13. Improvement in symptoms was assessed by reduction in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Outcome criterions for analysis were latency of response and remission; additional drugs were required for sedation. At the end of the 2-week study period, overall response rate in both the groups was similar (P > .1). In comparison to haloperidol group, patients treated with sodium valproate showed faster response, and on day 5, significant reduction in YMRS score was observed in the group treated with sodium valproate (P < .05). Total amount of lorazepam was less in patients treated with sodium valproate. Extrapyramidal symptom episodes were observed in 60% of patients treated with haloperidol. Sodium valproate in the treatment of acute mania is as efficacious as haloperidol but provides a faster response. It is safer compared to haloperidol.",

    "27": "Seventeen mechanically ventilated patients with hemorragic shock benefiting from a cardiovascular monitoring by PiCCO device and requiring rapid volume loading. Two hundred and fifty milliliters of HyperHES were given over 5 minutes. The efficacy of volume loading was assessed by the measure of the systolic arterial pressure (SAP), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume variation (SVV) and the indexed systemic vascular resistance (iSVR). Studied parameters were assessed at baseline, 5, 30, 60 and 180 minutes after the end of HyperHES infusion.",

Sodium (145 + or - 6 vs 136 + or - 5; p<0.001) and chloride (118 + or - 7 vs 107 + or - 6; p<0.001) were increased 5 minutes after the infusion. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio as the extravascular lung water was not influenced by the infusion. The follow-up of renal parameters during the three first days (creatinemia, uremia and diuresis) did not revelead significant variations.",

    "30": "Prospective observational study.", 
    "31": "Over the last years, genetic studies have greatly improved our knowledge on the receptor subtypes mediating various pharmacological effects of positive allosteric modulators at GABA(A) receptors. This stimulated the development of new benzodiazepine (BZ)-like ligands, especially those inactive/low-active at GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha(1) subunit, with the aim of generating more selective drugs. Hereby, the affinity and efficacy of four recently synthesized BZ site ligands: SH-053-2'N, SH-053-S-CH3-2'F, SH-053-R-CH3-2'F and JY-XHe-053 were assessed. They were also studied in behavioral tests of spontaneous locomotor activity, elevated plus maze, and water maze in rats, which are considered predictive of, respectively, the sedative, anxiolytic, and amnesic influence of BZs. The novel ligands had moderately low to low affinity and mild to partial agonistic efficacy at GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha(1) subunit, with variable, but more pronounced efficacy at other BZ-sensitive binding sites. While presumably alpha(1) receptor-mediated sedative effects of GABA(A) modulation were not fully eliminated with any of the ligands tested, only SH-053-2'N and SH-053-S-CH3-2'F, both dosed at 30 mg/kg, exerted anxiolytic effects. The lack of clear anxiolytic-like activity of JY-XHe-053, despite its efficacy at alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-GABA(A) receptors, may have been partly connected with its preferential affinity at alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors coupled with weak agonist activity at alpha(1)-containing subtypes. The memory impairment in water-maze experiments, generally reported with BZ site agonists, was completely circumvented with all four ligands. The results suggest that a substantial amount of activity at alpha(1) GABA(A) receptors is needed for affecting spatial learning and memory impairments, while much weaker activity at alpha(1)- and alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors is sufficient for eliciting sedation.", 
    "32": "The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an unusually attractive target for drug discovery since it contains five distinct drugable sites. The success of novel antiviral therapies will require nonnucleoside inhibitors to be active in at least patients infected with HCV of subtypes 1a and 1b. Therefore, the genotypic assessment of these agents against clinical isolates derived from genotype 1-infected patients is an important prerequisite for the selection of suitable candidates for clinical development. Here we report the 1a/1b subtype profiling of polymerase inhibitors that bind at each of the four known nonnucleoside binding sites. We show that inhibition of all of the clinical isolates tested is maintained, except for inhibitors that bind at the palm-1 binding site. Subtype coverage varies across chemotypes within this class of inhibitors, and inhibition of genotype 1a improves when hydrophobic contact with the polymerase is increased. We investigated if the polymorphism of the palm-1 binding site is the sole cause of the reduced susceptibility of subtype 1a to inhibition by 1,5-benzodiazepines by using reverse genetics, X-ray crystallography, and surface plasmon resonance studies. We showed Y415F to be a key determinant in conferring resistance on subtype 1a, with this effect being mediated through an inhibitor- and enzyme-bound water molecule. Binding studies revealed that the mechanism of subtype 1a resistance is faster dissociation of the inhibitor from the enzyme.", 
    "33": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no proven pharmacological treatment. Zolpidem immediate release formulation has been reported to show short-term improvements in motor function and voluntary saccadic eye movements, but the benefits were not sustained. A 61-year-old man with a 4-year history of PSP was observed over 6 months to have sustained improvement in motor function, pseudobulbar symptoms and ocular motility 2 months after commencing zolpidem controlled release (CR) formulation. He was admitted to hospital and a detailed neurological and functional assessment recorded on video after withdrawal of zolpidem CR, and again following re-introduction of the medication. Within 1 hour of administration of 25mg zolpidem CR the patient had a dramatic improvement in fine motor skills, dexterity, speed and fluidity of movement, facial and vocal expression, oropharyngeal coordination and function and pursuit, and voluntary saccadic eye movements. These improvements were observed for 4 hours to 5 hours post-dose and were reproducible on subsequent withdrawal and re-challenging. We found that zolpidem CR, a gamma aminobutryic acid (GABA)ergic agonist of the benzodiazepine type 1 receptor, caused sustained improvement in motor and ocular symptoms in a patient with PSP over 6 months. Further studies are needed to determine the potential roles of GABA neurotransmission in PSP.", 
    "34": "The proportion of Norwegians on disability pensions has doubled since the 1980s. The Norwegian Government wants action to stimulate the working capacity in those disability pensioners who have the potential to work. Information on factors that may impair rehabilitation efforts, including the unfavourable use of benzodiazepines, may be useful in this context. A longitudinal design, including data on 40-42 year old participants in Norwegian health surveys (year 1985-1989) linked to a prescription database (year 2004-2006), was used to describe risk of long-term use of benzodiazepines among disability pension recipients. The study population constituted benzodiazepine users at baseline. More than half of those on disability pensions, 57% of all men and 65% of all women, retrieved benzodiazepine prescriptions 20 years later, a span covering a large part of the potential active workforce period. Further, the observed amount of benzodiazepines dispensed over a three-year period indicated more than sporadic use e.g. half of the female disability pensioners were dispensed an amount of benzodiazepines corresponding to the use of a daily dose every second day over a three year period (median 450 daily doses). The majority of those who were dispensed benzodiazepines, were dispensed opioids as well: half of all men and 3 out of four women. And last, being on a disability pension was a predictor of benzodiazepine use 20 years later. Our study suggests that benzodiazepines are extensively and unfavourably used among disability pensioners, and that disability pension may have an independent effect on long-term use. Improved management of benzodiazepine use may be one alternative to get disability pensioners with the potential to work back into employment.", 
    "35": "The molecular mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs is not well understood. Their complex receptor affinity profiles indicate that their action could extend beyond dopamine receptor blockade. Single gene expression studies and high-throughput gene profiling have shown the induction of genes from several molecular classes and functional categories. Using a focused microarray approach, we investigated gene regulation in rat striatum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus after chronic administration of haloperidol or olanzapine. Regulated genes were validated by in situ hybridization, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Only limited overlap was observed in genes regulated by haloperidol and olanzapine. Both drugs elicited maximal gene regulation in the striatum and least in the hippocampus. Striatal gene induction by haloperidol was predominantly in neurotransmitter signaling, G-protein coupled receptors, and transcription factors. Olanzapine prominently induced retinoic acid and trophic factor signaling genes in the frontal cortex. The data also revealed the induction of several genes that could be targeted in future drug development efforts. The study uncovered the induction of several novel genes, including somatostatin receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The results demonstrating the regulation of multiple receptors and transcription factors suggests that both typical and atypical antipsychotics could possess a complex molecular mechanism of action.", 
    "36": "We review all available studies on the use of the newer anticonvulsant drug pregabalin (PGB) in the treatment of both alcohol dependence (AD) and benzodiazepine dependence (BD). In AD, the available evidence includes one open-label and one double-blind randomized studies, whereas in BD, only a few case reports and one open-label study are as yet available. In both conditions, PGB was found efficacious with significant improvement in withdrawal symptoms at the dosage ranges of 150-450 mg/day (AD) and 225-900 mg/day (BD). Moreover, its side effects were mild and transient. Despite the limited quality of the studies design, their findings suggest that PGB might constitute a novel efficacious and safe option in the treatment of both AD and BD.", 
    "37": "The key role of neuroinflammation in acute and chronic neurological disorders has stimulated the search for specific radiotracers targeting the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)/18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Here we evaluate the new radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) [(18)F]PBR111 in a rodent model of acute inflammation and compare it with [(11)C]CLINME, an (11)C-labelled tracer of the same chemical family, and with the isoquinolinic carboxamide [(11)C]PK11195.",

    "39": "We show that this radiotracer has a high in vitro specificity for PBR/TSPO versus central benzodiazepine receptors, as reflected by the drastic reduction of its binding to target tissue by addition of PK11195 or PBR111, while addition of flumazenil does not affect binding. Only intact [(18)F]PBR111 is detected in brain up to 60 min after i.v. injection, and PET imaging shows an increased uptake in the lesion as compared to the contralateral side as early as 6 min after injection. Administration of an excess of PK11195 and PBR111, 20 min after [(18)F]PBR111 administration, induces a rapid and complete displacement of [(18)F]PBR111 binding from the lesion. Modelling of the PET data using the simplified reference tissue model showed increased binding potential (BP) in comparison to [(11)C]PK11195.", 
    "40": "[(18)F]PBR111 is a metabolically stable tracer with a high specific in vitro and in vivo binding to TSPO. In addition, considering the longer half-life of (18)F over (11)C, these results support [(18)F]PBR111 as a promising PET tracer of the PBR/TSPO for neuroinflammation imaging.",

The mean absolute dose and area under the curve of irinotecan and SN-38 were not significantly different in either group (P > 0.18). In group B, the interindividual variability in the area under the curve of irinotecan and SN-38 was reduced by 19% and 25%, respectively (P > 0.22).

    "45": "6-Hydroxyflavone (6HF), a naturally occurring flavonoid, was previously reported to bind to type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors benzodiazepine (BZ) site with moderate binding affinity. In the present study, we showed that 6HF partially potentiated GABA-induced currents in native GABA(A) receptors expressed in cortical neurons via BZ site, as the enhancement was blocked by the antagonist flumazenil. Furthermore, in patch clamp studies, 6HF displayed significant preference for alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-containing subtypes, which were thought to mediate anxiolytic effect, compared to alpha(1)- and alpha(5)-containing subtypes expressed in HEK 293T cells. In mice, 6HF exhibited anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze test, unaccompanied at anxiolytic doses by the sedative, cognitive impairing, myorelaxant, motor incoordination and anticonvulsant effects commonly associated with classical BZs when tested in the hole-board, step-through passive avoidance, horizontal wire, rotarod, and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure tests, respectively. The findings therefore identified 6HF as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of anxiety-like disorders.",

    "52": "Thirty-four patients with essential voice tremor were identified over 40 months. Historical information regarding duration, family history, ethanol effect, arm tremor, and prior diagnosis was collected and examination was performed. Laryngeal and pharyngeal signs were graded using the Vocal Tremor Scoring System (VTSS); arm tremor was scored using the Washington Heights Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor Rating Scale (WHIGET). Patients rated vocal disability using the Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Information regarding treatment was collected both historically and prospectively.", 
    "53": "Ninety-three percent of patients were female. Voice tremor typically began in the seventh decade (62.9 +/- 15.0 years), and had been present for a mean of 6.7 +/- 13.4 years at the time of presentation. Tremor was present in a first-degree relative in 13 patients (38.2%); nine (26.5%) reported a beneficial effect of ethanol. Only 11 (32.3%) were aware of an arm tremor. Seven patients (20.6%) had been correctly diagnosed prior to evaluation; 16 (47.1%) were undiagnosed, and 10 (29.4%) had been misdiagnosed as spasmodic dysphonia. Clinical features were scored as follows: VTSS = 7.7 +/- 3.3, range 1 to 14; WHIGET = 8.5 +/- 7.5, range 0 to 31; VHI = 71 +/- 28, range 2 to 115. VTSS did not correlate with WHIGET, but did correlate with VHI. Only 56% of treated patients found botulinum toxin helpful.", 
    "54": "Essential voice tremor appears to affect more women than men. One third to one half of affected individuals have a family history of tremor. About one half of cases occur with upper extremity tremor no more severe than that seen in similarly aged normal individuals, contrary to what has been thought to date. Essential voice tremor is probably more common than is generally suspected, and many cases appear to be undiagnosed many years after onset or are misdiagnosed, most often as spasmodic dysphonia. The key feature is kinetic laryngeal tremor which usually extends beyond the larynx to involve the phonatory apparatus globally. Botulinum toxin may be helpful, but benefit is typically incomplete and not universal. Prolonged postinjection breathiness is the most common barrier to useful treatment.", 
    "55": "In chronic studies, the classical benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) is often the preferred drug because, unlike other benzodiazepines, it is soluble in water. However, rapid CDP hydrolysis in solution has been described. This would diminish plasma levels in chronic minipump studies and introduce the corelease of active compounds.", 
    "56": "Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the putative hydrolysis of CDP in aqueous solution over time and to identify the hydrolysis products. Moreover, we aimed to characterize the hydrolysis products for their in vitro (3H-flunitrazepam binding and oocyte electrophysiology) and in vivo (stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm) GABAA receptor potency.", 
    "57": "CDP in solution hydrolyzed to the ketone structure demoxepam which was confirmed using mass spectrometry. The hydrolysis was concentration dependent (first-order kinetics) and temperature dependent. CDP exerted greater potency compared to demoxepam in vitro (increased activity at GABAA receptors containing \u03b11 subunits) and in vivo (stress-induced hyperthermia), although 3H-flunitrazepam binding was comparable.", 
    "58": "The classical benzodiazepine CDP is rapidly hydrolyzed in solution to the active compound demoxepam which possesses a reduced activity at the GABAA receptor. Chronic studies that use CDP in aqueous solution should thus be interpreted with caution. It is therefore important to consider drug stability in chronic minipump applications.",

A retrospective chart review was conducted on 26 patients who received diazepam suppositories as adjuvant therapy to pelvic physical therapy and intramuscular trigger point injections for bladder pain, sexual pain, and levator hypertonus. Pelvic floor muscular tone and pain were assessed by palpation and perineometry; sexual pain was objectively rated by Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS-P). Twenty-five out of 26 patients reported subjective improvement with suppository use; six out of seven sexually active patients resumed intercourse. Sexual pain as assessed on FSFI and serial VAS-P improved with diazepam (by 1.44 on 10-point scale, p = 0.14). PFM tone improved during resting (p < 0.001), squeezing (p = 0.014), and relaxation (p = 0.003) phases. Vaginal diazepam suppositories gave a clinically significant improvement in the treatment of HTPFD compared with the usual treatment regimen alone.",

    "61": "In mice and in humans, treatment with the second-generation antipsychotic drug olanzapine (OLZ) produces excessive weight gain, adiposity and secondary metabolic complications, including loss of glucose and insulin homeostasis. In mice consuming a high-fat (HF) diet, a similar phenotype develops, which is inhibited by the analgesic acetaminophen (APAP) and by the antioxidant tetrahydroindenoindole (THII). Therefore, we examined the ability of APAP and THII to prevent metabolic changes in mice receiving OLZ.", 
    "62": "C57BL/6J mice received either a normal diet or a HF diet, and were administered daily dosages of OLZ (3 mg kg(-1) body weight), alone or with APAP (30 mg kg(-1) body weight) or THII (4.5 mg kg(-1) body weight), for 10 weeks. Parameters of body composition and metabolism, including glucose and insulin homeostasis and oxidative stress, were examined.", 
    "63": "OLZ treatment doubled the HF diet-induced increases in body weight and percent body fat. These increases were partially prevented by both APAP and THII, although food consumption was constant in all groups. The THII protection was associated with an increase in whole body and mitochondrial respiration. OLZ also exacerbated, and both APAP and THII prevented, HF diet-induced loss of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. As increased body fat promotes insulin resistance by a pathway involving oxidative stress, we evaluated production of reactive oxygen and lipid peroxidation in white adipose tissue (WAT). HF diet caused an increase in lipid peroxidation, NADPH-dependent O(2) uptake and H(2)O(2) production, which were further exacerbated by OLZ. APAP, THII and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride, each abolished oxidative stress in WAT.",

    "65": "This study was conducted to delineate the relationship between self-reported side effects and psychopathology in schizophrenia patients. Patients with schizophrenia completed the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale for subjective side effects and were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for their psychopathology. Based on a series of multiple linear regression analyses, we derived a model accounting for the relationships among the specific domains of psychopathology and red herring (RH) items of the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale in predicting subjective side effects. The model with anxiety/depressive symptoms and RH serving as mediators between positive symptoms and side effects was found to show good fit. Positive symptoms caused mostly anxiety symptoms and tendency to report RH items, whereby resulting in over-generalized reporting of subjective side effects. However, a large proportion of variance of side effects was explained by RH, which was only partially explained by positive symptoms alone. Therefore, patients with severe levels of positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms may be prone to nocebo-like effects of antipsychotics. Studies that include acute stage patients presenting severe levels of these symptoms should not rely only on the subjective report of side effects but also apply objective measures.", 
    "66": "Children with autism often display difficult behaviors including tantrums, extreme irritability, and physical aggression. There is emerging evidence that olanzapine is useful in decreasing these disruptive behaviors. The most common adverse effects are weight gain and short-term sedation. On the other hand, olanzapine rarely causes rhabdomyolysis. We report a case with rhabdomyolysis in an autistic child just after 2 doses of olanzapine treatment. Initial creatine kinase value was 30,690 IU/L (range, 5-130 U/L), and rhabdomyolysis resolved with hydration and alkalinization over 7 days. Monitoring serum creatine kinase levels may be useful in pediatric cases after initiation of olanzapine treatment.",

    "68": "Two hundred and twenty-four community-dwelling older participants were studied (154 females and 70 males, mean age 72.6, standard deviation 7.3) who were without dementia or risk factors for autonomic neuropathy. Men and women were well matched for baseline characteristics. Finometer Pro was used to noninvasively monitor participants during an active stand test. Derived hemodynamic parameters were extracted with BeatScope (5-s averages method) at different phases (baseline, nadir, and recovery at 2 minutes), and compared between men and women. OI symptoms were recorded. Subgroup analyses were conducted focusing on the presence or absence of antihypertensives.", 
    "69": "Men and women did not differ in OI. Men tended to drop to a lower nadir (117 vs. 128 mmHg, P=0.001) and reach lower recovery systolic blood pressure than women (161 vs. 171 mmHg, P=0.006); Women had greater total peripheral resistance (P<0.001) and a trend towards lower stroke volumes (P<0.01). However, these differences disappeared in the nonmedicated subgroup. Consistently, women had greater aortic impedance and lower arterial compliance (P<0.001), suggesting greater arterial stiffness.",

    "71": "Psychological stress has a high incidence after burn injury, therefore, anxiolytic drugs are often prescribed. Unfortunately, to date, no burn study has investigated the effects of anxiolytic drugs on the ability to fight infection. This study was undertaken to determine if psychological stress, anxiety-modulating drugs, or both, alter survival following an infection. On day 0, 7-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice either received a 15% full-thickness flame burn or were sham treated (anesthesia and shaved), whereas controls received no treatment. Mice received midazolam (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or saline daily and were stressed by exposure to rat in a guinea pig cage or placed in an empty cage for 1 hour a day, beginning on postburn day 1. For the survival experiments, mice either received bacteria after 2 or 8 consecutive days of predator exposure and drug treatment, which continued daily for 7 days after inoculation. In a separate set of experiments, after eight daily injections of midazolam, mice were given lipopolysaccharide, bacteria, or saline and were killed 12 hours later. Mice that received midazolam had improved survival rates when compared with their saline-treated counterparts, and the protective effect was more significant the more days they received the drug. For most of the cytokines, the bacteria-induced increase was significantly attenuated by midazolam as was the amount of bacteria in the liver. The protective effect seems to be independent of the drug's anxiolytic activity as there were no significant differences in survival between the predator-stressed and the nonstressed mice. The mechanisms responsible for the protective effect remain to be elucidated.",

    "73": "An UPLC-TOF-MS method for simultaneous screening and quantification of 52 drugs in hair was developed and validated. The selected drugs represent the most common classes of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, analgesics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, cocaine, ketamine and opioids. Hair samples were extracted with methanol:acetonitrile:ammonium formate (2 mM, 8% acetonitrile, pH 5.3) overnight at 37 degrees C. The target drugs were separated and quantified using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC coupled to a Waters Micromass LCT Premier XE Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer. Total chromatographic run time was 17min. The data were treated with the MassLynx software ChromaLynx XS and QuanLynx for automated identification and quantification, respectively. The limits of detection ranged from 0.01 to 0.10 ng/mg using a 10-mg hair sample and the limit of quantification was 0.05 ng/mg for 87% of the analytes. A good linear behaviour was achieved for most of the analytes in the range from LOQ to 10 or 25 ng/mg except for the amphetamines. The method showed an acceptable precision and trueness, since the obtained CV and BIAS values were <or=25% for 81% of the analytes. The extraction recoveries for 92% of the analytes ranged between 84 and 106% and the extraction recoveries for all analytes were better than 60%. The method was applied to 15 autopsy hair samples from forensic investigations showing a wide abuse pattern of many pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse within a period of less than three months. The present study demonstrated that the combination of accurate mass and retention time can provide good selectivity, which demonstrates that the TOF instrument is adequate for both screening and quantification purposes. Furthermore, it was shown that screening with the ChromaLynx XS software is less sensitive and selective for some analytes than the QuanLynx software, especially in low concentrations.", 
    "74": "A series of novel 3-alkoxy-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones (7-15) was synthesized and their in vitro affinity for both the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) of rat brain was studied. Racemic mixture of 7-bromo-3-(2-methoxy)ethoxy-5-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (13) was separated into enantiomers 14, 15 by chiral HPLC. Absolute configuration of R-enantiomer 15 was determined by the method of X-ray diffraction analysis. The affinity of S-enantiomer 14 for CBR ( IC50)=245 nM) is 20-fold higher than the affinity of R-enantiomer 15 (IC50)=4,930 nM). A high selectivity for CBR versus PBR (IC50) (PBR)>10,000 nM) was shown by all reported compounds. Compound 12 was revealed as a potent (IC50)=9 nM) and selective CBR ligand among the synthesized 3-alkoxy-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones.", 
    "75": "It is well known that high fat and high cholesterol levels present a contributing factor to pathologies including fatty liver and atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress is also considered to play a role in these pathologies. The 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is known to be involved in cholesterol metabolism, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular pathology. We applied a high fat high cholesterol atherogenic (HFHC) diet to rats to study correlations between cardiovascular and liver pathology, oxidative stress, and TSPO expression in the liver and the cardiovascular system. This study corroborates the presence of increased oxidative stress markers and decreased anti-oxidants in liver and aorta. In addition, it appeared that induction of oxidative stress in the liver and aorta by atherogenic HFHC diet was accompanied by a reduction in TSPO binding density in both these tissues. Our data suggest that involvement of TSPO in oxidative stress and ROS generation, as reported in other studies, may also take part in atherogenesis as induced by HFHC diet. Presently, it is not clear whether this TSPO response is compensatory for the stress induced by HFHC diet or is a participant in the induction of oxidative stress.", 
    "76": "Since allopregnanolone (ALLO) elicits anxiolytic-like action and increases neuropeptide Y Y1 (NPY Y1) receptors gene expression in the amygdala, we were interested in studying the involvement of NPY Y1 receptors in the anxiolytic-like actions of ALLO. The anxiety-like behavior was evaluated in mice using Vogel's conflict test (VCT), in which number of shocks were measured. ALLO and NPYergic agents, alone or in combinations, were administered bilaterally into the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA). The intra-CeA administration of ALLO, NPY or NPY Y1/Y5 receptors agonist [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY resulted in dose-dependent increase in the number of shocks in VCT, indicating anxiolytic-like effect. However, opposite effect was observed following administration of selective NPY Y1 receptors antagonist BIBP3226. While prior administration with NPY or [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY, at the subeffective dose, potentiated the ALLO-induced anxiolytic-like effect, the same was antagonized by BIBP3226. Further, the effect of acute ALLO (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) on the endogenous NPY system in the CeA, ventral part of lateral division of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTLV), nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) and arcuate nucleus (ARC) was studied with immunocytochemistry. Acute ALLO treatment significantly decreased the population of NPY-immunoreactive cells in the CeA and also in the ARC. While NPY-immunoreactive fibers were slightly increased in the AcbC and BSTLV, the cells in AcbC and fibers in ARC did not respond. We suggest that NPY may mediate ALLO induced anxiolytic-like behavior in the neuroanatomical framework of the CeA, possibly via NPY Y1 receptors.", 
    "77": "Enhancement of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function has emerged as a novel strategy for treatment of depression. Nevertheless, studies on AMPAR function in chronic animal models used to predict antidepressant efficacy are surprisingly lacking. We investigated the role of AMPARs in antidepressant action in an unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model in BALB/c mice. After 3 wk of UCMS, BALB/c mice developed a number of depressive-like behaviours that were successfully prevented by fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) administration. The AMPAR potentiator LY392098 [N-2-(4-(3-thienyl)phenyl)propyl 2-propanesulfonamide] (5 mg/kg), when administered alone, functioned like classic antidepressants by reducing weight loss, fur deterioration and immobility in the tail suspension test. However, LY392098 did not restore sucrose preference and did not reduce anxiety (marble-burying) in stressed mice. In the same protocol, the AMPAR antagonist GYKI (10 mg/kg) reversed most, but not all, of the antidepressant-like actions of fluoxetine. Thus, the antidepressant-like effects of LY392098 were fully predicted by the AMPAR dependence of effects demonstrated for fluoxetine. Our results demonstrate that, in the UCMS paradigm, AMPAR activation exhibits antidepressant-like activity that relates preferentially to specific depressive-like responses and that those specific responses can be defined by their regulation by AMPAR modulation under conditions of stress.",

Immunocytochemical assay revealed decreased levels of PBR, its endogenous ligand DBI and cytochrome P450scc in malignant skin cells in comparison to normal keratinocytes and melanocytes. These data indicate diminished steroidogenesis in skin cancer.", 
    "79": "This protocol describes how to perform automated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and thin-film microextraction (TFME) in a 96-well plate format for high-throughput analysis of drugs, metabolites and any other analytes of interest in biological fluids using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Sample preparation time required is typically 1 min per sample; hence, the throughput achievable with automated SPME/TFME is comparable with automated 96-well liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction methods, but greater than most online solid-phase extraction methods. The technique is applicable to complex samples such as whole blood without additional pretreatment. The amount of analyte extracted by SPME/TFME is proportional to the free (unbound) concentration of the analyte; hence, SPME/TFME can be used to determine both total and free concentrations of analytes from a single biofluid sample and to perform automated ligand-receptor binding studies in order to determine binding affinity and/or overall extent of ligand binding to a complex biofluid.", 
    "80": "The time course of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores in adult schizophrenia patients was modeled, and the effectiveness of paliperidone extended-release tablets (paliperidone ER) and olanzapine was quantified. Data from 3 randomized, double-blind phase III studies were used. Patients received paliperidone ER (3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 mg), olanzapine 10 mg, or matched placebo once daily for 6 consecutive weeks. An indirect response model implemented using a nonlinear mixed effects approach described the time course of the PANSS. Deterioration rate was modeled as a function of baseline PANSS score, placebo, and drug effects, and the dropout effect. An exponential decrease of the placebo response was also implemented. Paliperidone ER and olanzapine treatment were characterized by a long-lasting drug effect (13%), with a larger but short-lasting placebo effect (40%) and a notable dropout rate. The covariate exploration failed to identify any clinically relevant factors. The nonparametric bootstrap analysis confirmed the acceptable precision of parameter estimates. The visual predictive check supported the model's adequacy to reproduce observed PANSS time courses. The population model describes the time course of PANSS scores in schizophrenia patients and is appropriate for use in clinical trial simulation activities.", 
    "81": "Macrophage presence within atherosclerotic plaque is a feature of instability and a risk factor for plaque rupture and clinical events. Activated macrophages express high levels of the translocator protein/peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (TSPO/PBR). In this study, we investigated the potential for quantifying plaque inflammation by targeting this receptor. TSPO expression and distribution in the plaque were quantified using radioligand binding assays and autoradiography. We show that cultured human macrophages expressed 20 times more TSPO than cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the other abundant cell type in plaque. The TSPO ligands [3H](R)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([3H](R)-PK11195) and [3H]N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([3H]-DAA1106) bound to the same sites in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques in vitro, and demonstrated significant correlation with macrophage-rich regions. In conclusion, our data indicate that radioisotope-labelled DAA1106 has the potential to quantify the macrophage content of atherosclerotic plaque.", 
    "82": "In the neonatal period, seizures rank among the most common neurological symptoms, often indicating an underlying serious neurological condition. It is remarkable that although new tools have been incorporated into the diagnosis of neonatal seizures, there is no consensus about the therapeutic approach among different doctors and institutions. Hence, although phenobarbital is still considered the initial drug of choice, the protocols reported in the literature show a great variability in the approach to treatment of refractory seizures. We used a questionnaire to gain information regarding the treatment of seizures in the neonatal period in different European institutions.",

    "104": "The reasons for elevated levels of measles antibodies in the psychiatric groups are not known with certainty and should be studied in prospective investigations.", 
    "105": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is performed under anesthesia and muscle relaxation. Only well-generalized seizures seem to have the high \"adequacy\" or \"quality\" that have been claimed to reflect positive predictive power for the outcome of an ECT course. The induction of well-generalized seizures can be potentially influenced by several variables. One major variable is concurrent medication including anesthetic drugs, since most anesthetic drugs are potent anticonvulsives. We hypothesized a negative influence of anesthetics and benzodiazepines but a positive effect of antidepressants and antipsychotics concurrently applied during ECT on seizure adequacy.", 
    "106": "We included inpatients (n = 41) with a DSM-IV-diagnosed major depressive episode treated with ECT (411 ECT sessions) during a period of 20 months (May 2005 to December 2006) in an open label and noncontrolled study. A repeated measurement regression analysis was performed with 8 seizure adequacy parameters as dependent variables. We indirectly quantified narcotic agent influence with bispectral index monitoring.", 
    "107": "In contrast to the impact of psychiatric comedication, this measure of \"depth of narcosis\" prior stimulation turned out to influence most seizure adequacy parameters in a highly significant manner.", 
    "108": "Thus, we concluded that the anticonvulsive properties of narcotic agents have much higher influence than concomitant psychotropic medication. Our data support the view that a significant influence of concurrent psychotropic drugs on seizure adequacy markers is missing, especially when directly compared with other confounders like stimulation energy, age, and depth of narcosis. The latter suggests to further prove the idea that lighter anesthesia is indeed an important tool to get patients faster into remission.", 
    "109": "In the Netherlands, the policy on care for prisoners who are addicted to opiates is still heterogeneous. The recent guidelines entitled 'Medicinal care for drug addicts in penal institutions' should contribute towards unambiguous and more evidence-based treatment for this group. In addition, it should improve and bring the care pathways within judicial institutions and mainstream healthcare more into line with one another. Each rational course of medicinal treatment will initially be continued in the penal institution. In penal institutions the help on offer is mainly focused on abstinence from illegal drugs while at the same time limiting the damage caused to the health of the individual user. Methadone is regarded at the first choice for maintenance therapy. For patient safety, this is best given in liquid form in sealed cups of 5 mg/ml once daily in the morning. Recently a combination preparation containing buprenorphine and naloxone - a complete opiate antagonist - has become available. On discontinuation of opiate maintenance treatment intensive follow-up care is necessary. During this period there is considerable risk of a potentially lethal overdose. Detoxification should be coupled with psychosocial or medicinal intervention aimed at preventing relapse. Naltrexone is currently the only available opiate antagonist for preventing relapse. In those addicted to opiates, who also take benzodiazepines without any indication, it is strongly recommended that these be reduced and discontinued. This can be achieved by converting the regular dosage into the equivalent in diazepam and then reducing this dosage by a maximum of 25% a week.", 
    "110": "Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly drugs of first choice in schizophrenia. Amisulpride, a new atypical antipsychotic, is reported to be effective for both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia in Western countries but Indian experience is limited. The aim of the present study was therefore to conduct a trial of amisulpride versus olanzapine in Indian schizophrenia patients.", 
    "111": "Eighty adult patients of either sex were randomized to receive standard doses of the two drugs orally, in a single blind manner, for 12 weeks, with follow up at 4 and 8 weeks. Effectiveness was assessed by changes in scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and physician-administered Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (ADRs).", 
    "112": "Evaluable were 39 patients on amisulpride and 38 on olanzapine. The groups were comparable at baseline with respect to demographics, illness duration and rating scores. Final BPRS score was lower for olanzapine (33.2 +/- 9.44) than for amisulpride (37.7 +/- 9.67). SAPS and SANS scores and CGI rating improved individually in both arms but remained comparable between groups throughout the study period, but olanzapine reduced SAPS score to a greater extent. ADRs were encountered in 67.5% and 47.5% of patients (p = 0.113) on amisulpride and olanzapine, respectively. Tremor and insomnia were more frequent with amisulpride, while olanzapine caused more weight gain and sedation. No serious ADRs occurred.", 
    "113": "Amisulpride, although comparable to olanzapine on some measures, did not match the improvement seen with the latter drug in BPRS and SAPS scores. Despite differences in ADR profiles, overall tolerability was satisfactory for both drugs. In Indian patients, amisulpride should therefore be an alternative to olanzapine to a limited extent, such as when weight gain and sedation are undesirable.", 
    "114": "Physiological stress responses to capture may be an indicator of welfare challenges induced by animal handling. Simultaneously, blood chemistry changes induced by stress responses may confound experimental design by interacting with the biological parameters being measured. Cortisol elevation is a common indicator of stress responses in mammals and reproductive condition can profoundly influence endocrine response. We measured changes in blood cortisol and testosterone induced by handling reproductively active male Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) early and late in the breeding season. Weddell seals have the highest resting cortisol levels of all mammals yet showed a clear, prolonged elevation in cortisol in response to capture. Responses were similar when first caught and when caught a second time, later in the breeding season. Baseline testosterone levels declined over the breeding season but were not altered by capture. Administering a light dose of diazepam significantly ameliorated the cortisol response of handled animals without affecting testosterone levels. This may be an effective way of reducing acute capture stress responses. Male breeding success in years males were handled was no different to the years they were not, despite the acute capture response, suggesting no long-term impact of handling on male reproductive output.", 
    "115": "Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used as a first-line treatment in depression. However, many depressed patients are also treated with benzodiazepines to alleviate increased anxiety and sleep disturbances normally associated with depression. Since benzodiazepines inhibit 5-HT neuronal firing activity, they might attenuate SSRI-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT levels. This study aimed to assess, using in-vivo microdialysis, the effects of the benzodiazepines oxazepam or temazepan on the SSRI paroxetine-induced 5-HT increase in the hippocampus of freely moving guinea-pigs. It was found that the acute systemic administration of paroxetine increased extracellular 5-HT levels. Pre-administration of oxazepam or temazepam significantly diminished the paroxetine-induced elevation of extracellular 5-HT levels (from 350% to 200% of baseline). It was concluded that benzodiazepines attenuate the ability of SSRIs to elevate hippocampal 5-HT levels. Thus, co-administration of benzodiazepines might affect the therapeutic efficacy of SSRI treatment.", 
    "116": "This updated version of the bipolar depression algorithm of the Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program aims to provide an organized, sequential, and evidence-supported approach for the treatment of that disorder. After initial evaluation and diagnosis, the psychiatrist should first assess whether there is an urgent indication for ECT. If ECT is not indicated, and the patient has psychotic symptoms, then an antipsychotic should be part of the medication regimen. Next, if the patient is not currently treated with mood stabilizers, there is a slight preference for lithium. If lithium is not effective or tolerated, treatment with quetiapine or lamotrigine should be initiated. If the patient is currently taking other mood stabilizers, their dosage should be optimized, and the clinician should consider adding or switching to lithium, quetiapine, or lamotrigine. Next, if the patient is not at especially high risk of mood destabilization, an antidepressant can be added in the bipolar depressed patient who has failed trials of lithium, quetiapine, and lamotrigine. Rapid-cycling depressed patients may require combinations of two or three mood stabilizers. ECT, along with other psychopharmacological options, could be reconsidered for the treatment of refractory bipolar depressed patients.", 
    "117": "Preschoolers frequently require sedation for echocardiograms. This study compared various sedation drugs at the authors' institution, as well as the charges for moderate versus deep sedation. From 2001 to 2007, sedation was administered to 703 patients ages 2 to 4 years. Four drug regimens were used: chloral hydrate (CH), chloral hydrate with diphenhydramine (CH + D), chloral hydrate with hydroxyzine hydrochloride (CH + H), and midazolam. The mean onset of sedation was 37 min, and the mean duration of sedation was 47 min. The CH group fell asleep the most quickly (30 min; p < 0.001), and the CH + D patients experienced the most prolonged sedations (13%; p < 0.001). Studies were completed by 97% of the chloral hydrate group, 98% of the CH + D group, and 94% of the CH + H group compared with 66% of the midazolam group (p < 0.001). Complications (7.4%) were minor and not significant for any particular medication. The charges for moderate sedation averaged $709 compared with $3,628 for deep sedation. The findings demonstrated that chloral hydrate was the fastest-acting agent and had a high success rate with minimally prolonged sedations. The low complication rate for chloral hydrate, and the much lower cost for its use to induce moderate sedation have made chloral hydrate our preference for the echocardiographic sedation of preschoolers.", 
    "118": "Zolpidem (trade name Ambien) has attracted much interest as a sleep-inducing agent and also in research. Attention has been centered mainly on receptor binding and electrochemistry in the central nervous system which are briefly addressed herein. A novel integrated approach to mode of action is presented. The pathways to be discussed involve basicity, reduction potential, electrostatics, cell signaling, GABA receptor binding, electron transfer (ET), pharmacodynamics, structure activity relationships (SAR) and side effects. The highly conjugated pyridinium salt formed by protonation of the amidine moiety is proposed to be the active form acting as an ET agent. Extrapolation of reduction potentials for related compounds supports the premise that zolpidem may act as an ET species in vivo. From recent literature reports, electrostatics is believed to play a significant role in drug action. The pyridinium cation displays molecular electrostatic potential which may well play a role energetically or as a bridging mechanism. An SAR analysis points to analogy with other physiologically active xenobiotics, namely benzodiazepines and paraquat in the conjugated iminium category. Inactivity of metabolites indicates that the parent is the active form of zolpidem. Absence of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress is in line with minor side effects. In contrast, generally, the prior literature contains essentially no discussion of these fundamental biochemical relationships. Pharmacodynamics may play an important role. Concerning behavior at the blood-brain barrier, useful insight can be gained from investigations of the related cationic anesthetics that are structurally related to acetyl choline. Evidently, the neutral form of the drug penetrates the neuronal membrane, with the salt form operating at the receptor. The pathways of zolpidem have several clinical implications since the agent affects sedation, electroencephalographic activity, oxidative metabolites and receptors in the central nervous system. The drug acts at the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site, displaying high and intermediate affinities to various receptor regions. Structural features for tight binding were determined. The sedative and anticonvulsant activities are due to its action on the alpha-1-GABA(A) receptors. One of the common adverse responses to zolpidem is hallucinations. Proposed mechanisms comprise changes in the GABA(A) receptor, pharmacodynamic interactions involving serotonin and neuronal-weak photon emission processes entailing redox phenomena. Reports cite cases of abuse with cravings based on anxiolytic and stimulating actions. It is important to recognize that insight concerning processes at the fundamental, molecular level can translate into beneficial results involving both positive and adverse side effects. In order for this to occur, interdisciplinary interaction is necessary. Suggestions are made for future research aimed at testing the various hypotheses.", 
    "119": "A deeper level of sedation by an anaesthesiologist is requirement for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in paediatric populations and sedation of children is different from sedation of adults. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability and cost effectiveness of ketamine, diazepam combination to midazolam, fentanyl combination for sedation of children during MRI. One hundred twenty children of both sex, age between 1-10 years, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I and II were distributed into two groups. Group A (n=60) were sedated with 1.5 mg/kg body weight ketamine and 0.1 mg/kg body weight diazepam intravenously. Group B (n=60) were sedated with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight and fentanyl 1 microg/kg body weight intravenously. Both groups showed satisfactory sedating condition for MRI. Incidences of side effects of drug regimens during sedation and recovery were recorded in both groups; those were transient and minor inconveniences. Pulse, blood pressure and respiration were within normal range in both groups. Mean procedure time was almost same in both groups and mean recovery time was more in group A than group B and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Every child of both groups was discharged to home. Sedation regimen of group B found 5 times more costly than group A. Both the regimens were found safe and effective for paediatric sedation during MRI but ketamine, diazepam combination found more cost effective which, is a considerable matter in Bangladesh.", 
    "120": "A semisolid dosage form of clonazepam (CZP), administered to the oral cavity between the lower gum and bottom lip with small volume of saline, was developed to obtain the stable dosage which can replace the injection dosage form. Semisolid dosage forms were prepared using a mixture of CZP/(polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG))/(oleic acid (OA)) at the ratios of 1/39/0, 1/37/2 and 2/36/2 (w/w), named CZP1-PEG, CZP1-PEG-OA and CZP2-PEG-OA, respectively, and were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. No crystal of CZP was observed in CZP1-PEG-OA for at least 8 days, while CZP crystal appeared before administration for CZP2-PEG-OA. When a small volume of saline was added to CZP1-PEG-OA just before the oral cavity administration, more than 80% (w/w) was found to exist in the soluble form. Each semisolid dosage form (40 mg) was administered to the oral cavity in rats, and CZP 1 mg suspension in 0.5% (w/v) sodium carboxymethylcellulose aqueous solution was administered into rat stomach as a control. CZP1-PEG-OA gave the plasma concentrations of more than 5 ng/ml and 12 ng/ml at 30 min and 1 h after administration, respectively, which might be near the plasma levels effective for the suppression of epileptic seizures in human, while the plasma concentration was less than 5 ng/ml at 30 min or did not reach 10 ng/ml at 1 h for the other formulations. It is proposed that the semisolid dosage form CZP1-PEG-OA should be a possibly useful preparation for the antiepileptic or sedative medication.",

However, it was found that the drug substance was remarkably chemically unstable in tablet form compared to the powder mixture for tableting. Chemical destabilization due to compression also occurred in the drug substance alone. After investigating the cause of the destabilization, powder X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the crystallinity of the drug substance decreased depending on the extent of mechanical treatments such as compression and grinding. In thermal analysis it became evident that the exothermic peaks due to degradation clearly broadened and shifted toward lower temperatures by these mechanical treatments. It was then revealed that the degradation temperature decreased and the amount of degradation products after storage increased with decreasing crystallinity, even though there was little change in the amount of degradation products shortly after mechanical treatments. These results demonstrated that the drug substance became chemically unstable with decreasing crystallinity. It was proved that chemical instability of the drug substance in the tablet preparation was due to decreasing crystallinity caused by compression. It would therefore be difficult to produce chemically stable tablets containing this compound using a conventional manufacturing process. Tablets for this compound should be prepared without mechanical treatments such as compression and grinding.",

We analyzed age, sex, age at seizure onset, seizure types, EEG, MRI/CT findings and response to antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "124": "Seven patients (five women, two men; median age at time of MSE 31 years; range 17-73) with MSE out of a total of 247 patients with JME were identified. The median follow-up time was seven years (range 0-35), the incidence was 3.2/1,000 patient years. Median duration of epilepsy before MSE was 26 years (range 10-58). We identified three subtypes: 1) MSE with myoclonic seizures only in two patients, 2) MSE with generalized tonic clonic seizures in three, and 3) generalized tonic clonic seizures with myoclonic absence status in two patients. All patients responded promptly to benzodiazepines. One patient had repeated episodes of MSE. Precipitating events were identified in all but one patient. Drug withdrawal was identified in four patients, one of whom had additional sleep deprivation and alcohol intake. Two patients received inappropriate treatment (carbamazepine, phenytoin).",

    "126": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a treatable parasomnia involving dream-enacting behaviors that is considered to be a male-predominant disorder. However, it is speculated that underrecognition of RBD among female patients in part contributes to the male predominance, probably because women have less aggressive and violent RBD behaviors. We conducted a literature review focused primarily on women with RBD, in which the age of onset of RBD, types of nocturnal behaviors, presence of dream enactment, polysomnographic findings, clinical course, treatment response, male/female ratio, comorbid diagnoses, and medications were tabulated and discussed. RBD was found to primarily affect middle-aged and older women and those with a broad range of neurological disorders. As the link between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, becomes increasingly apparent, including the delayed emergence of parkinsonism in patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic RBD, primary care and specialty physicians should be aware of RBD in women, its potential complications, its excellent response to clonazepam, and its association with neurological disorders and older age groups.", 
    "127": "Golgi body-mediated signaling has been linked to its fragmentation and regeneration during the mitotic cycle of the cell. During this process, Golgi-resident proteins are released to the cytosol and interact with other signaling molecules to regulate various cellular processes. Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 protein (ACBD3) is a Golgi protein involved in several signaling events. ACBD3 protein was previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and cAMP-dependent protein kinase associated protein 7 (PAP7), Golgi complex-associated protein of 60kDa (GCP60), Golgi complex-associated protein 1 (GOCAP1), and Golgi phosphoprotein 1 (GOLPH1). In this review, we present the gene ontology of ACBD3, its relations to other Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing (ACBD) proteins, and its biological function in steroidogenesis, apoptosis, neurogenesis, and embryogenesis. We also discuss the role of ACBD3 in asymmetric cell division and cancer. New findings about ACBD3 may help understand this newly characterized signaling molecule and stimulate further research into its role in molecular endocrinology, neurology, and stem cell biology.", 
    "128": "Cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing basket cells encompass a subclass of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons that regulate memory-forming oscillatory network activity of the hippocampal formation in accordance to the emotional and motivational state of the animal, conveyed onto these cells by respective extrahippocampal afferents. Various excitatory and inhibitory afferent and efferent synapses of the hippocampal CCK basket cells express serotoninergic, cholinergic, cannabinoid, and benzodiazepine sensitive receptors, all contributing to their functional plasticity. We explored whether CCK basket cells are modulated by neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the major local neuropeptides that strongly inhibits hippocampal excitability and has significant effect on its memory function. Here, using GAD65-GFP transgenic mice for prospective identification of CCK basket cells and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we show for the first time that excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto CCK basket cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are modulated by NPY through activation of NPY Y2 receptors. The frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs, as well as the amplitudes of stimulation-evoked EPSCs were decreased. Similarly, the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature IPSCs, and the amplitudes of stimulation-evoked IPSCs were decreased after NPY application. Most of the effects of NPY could be attributed to a presynaptic site of action. Our data provide the first evidence that the excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto the CCK basket cells could be modulated by local levels of NPY, and may change the way these cells process extrahippocampal afferent information, influencing hippocampal function and its network excitability during normal and pathological oscillatory activities.", 
    "129": "GS-9350 is a new chemical entity under development as a potent, mechanism-based inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms. Its intended use is to increase the systemic exposure of coadministered agents that are metabolized by CYP3A enzymes. Unlike ritonavir, which is in current clinical use for this purpose, GS-9350 is devoid of anti-HIV activity. The pharmacokinetics of GS-9350 and its efficacy in increasing systemic exposure of the probe CYP3A substrate midazolam were examined in a study involving single- and multiple-dose escalations of GS-9350 from 50 to 400 mg. Single-dose escalation from 50 to 400 mg resulted in a 164-fold increase in GS-9350 exposure, whereas multiple-dose escalation in the dosage range of 50-300 mg resulted in a 47-fold increase in exposure. GS-9350 potently inhibited midazolam apparent clearance (95% reduction), similar in effect to ritonavir 100 mg. GS-9350 was generally well tolerated at all doses, and there was no evidence of dose-limiting toxicity. Establishing proof-of-concept, GS-9350 is currently under phase II development as a potential alternative to ritonavir for use with antiretroviral agents (including the HIV integrase inhibitor elvitegravir) that are often prescribed along with a \"booster\" drug.", 
    "130": "It is well known that, under certain boundary conditions, the retrieval of a stable consolidated memory results into a labile one. During this unstable phase, memory can be vulnerable to interference by a number of pharmacological agents, including benzodiazepines. One of the goals of this study was to evaluate the vulnerability to midazolam (MDZ) after reactivation of recent and remote contextual fear memories in animals that experienced a stressful situation before learning. Animals were subjected to a restraint session and trained in a contextual fear paradigm the following day; consolidated memories were reactivated at different times after learning and different MDZ doses (1.5, 3.0 mg/kg) were administered to rats after reactivation. Our results show that MDZ did not affect memory reconsolidation in older-than-one-day memories of stressed animals, even after the administration of a higher MDZ dose and a longer reactivation session (5 min). In contrast, MDZ was effective in blocking reconsolidation at all memory ages in unstressed animals. In addition, the current research investigated whether activating NMDA sites before reactivation promotes the destabilization of resistant memories such as those of stressed animals. We tested the influence of pre-reactivation D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial NMDA agonist, on MDZ's effect on fear memory reconsolidation in stressed animals. Our findings indicate that DCS before reactivation promotes retrieval-induced lability in resistant memory traces, as MDZ-induced memory impairment in stressed rats became evident with pre-reactivation DCS but not after pre-reactivation sterile isotonic saline.",

    "132": "Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis) is a popular and widely available herbal supplement, primarily used to treat insomnia and anxiety. Until recently, its mechanism of action has remained unknown. Neurobiological research has begun to show that the herb, with its active valerenic acid, interacts with the GABA(A)-ergic system, a mechanism of action similar to the benzodiazepine drugs. This series of experiments sought to corroborate these findings with behavioral measures, compare them to the benzodiazepine diazepam, and to analyze the chemical composition of Valeriana officinalis. Rats were administered either ethanol (1 ml/kg), diazepam (1mg/kg), valerian root extract (3 ml/kg), valerenic acid (3mg/kg), or a solution of valerenic acid and exogenous GABA (75 microg/kg and 3.6 microg/kg, respectively) and assessed for the number of entries and time spent on the open arms of an elevated plus maze. Results showed that there was a significant reduction in anxious behavior when valerian extract or valerenic acid exposed subjects were compared to the ethanol control group. The evidence supports Valeriana officinalis as a potential alternative to the traditional anxiolytics as measured by the elevated plus maze.", 
    "133": "Preclinical studies demonstrated that ocinaplon, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors, possesses anxiolytic-like actions at doses devoid of the side effects typically associated with benzodiazepines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ocinaplon in a multicenter, double-blind proof-of-concept trial of male and female outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD with no coexisting depression, and had a baseline score of > or =20 on the Hamilton Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Patients with <20% reduction in HAM-A to placebo in a single-blind 7-day run-in period were randomly assigned to treatment with ocinaplon 90 mg t.i.d. (n = 31) or placebo for 28 days (n = 29). Ocinaplon was more effective than placebo in reducing HAM-A scores (P= 0.009). Patients assigned to ocinaplon exhibited a mean improvement of 14.2 points (SE = 2.6) on the total score of the HAM-A scale at the conclusion of the trial, while patients assigned to placebo obtained a mean improvement of 6.3 points (SE = 2.0). A significant (P= 0.023) difference in improvement between ocinaplon and placebo was observed beginning at and continuing from 1-week after the initiation of dosing. The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was not statistically significant between ocinaplon and placebo. One serious adverse event (SAE) occurred in the ocinaplon group that was considered possibly related to study medication (icterus following transaminase elevations). The patient had preexisting medical conditions that may have contributed to this SAE. A full recovery was observed with no residual effects. The overall safety profile revealed no patterns of TEAEs, including those effects typically associated with other anxiolytic and/or benzodiazepine compounds, such as sedation. Ocinaplon appears to be a well-tolerated and effective treatment for GAD. It produces a rapid onset of anxiolytic action absent the side effects (e.g., dizziness, sedation) typically reported following anxiolytic doses of benzodiazepines.", 
    "134": "Cynomolgus macaques are frequently used in drug metabolism studies due to their evolutionary closeness to humans. Despite their importance, genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes have not been fully identified in this species. In this study, the cDNA orthologous to human cytochrome P450 3A43 (CYP3A43) was isolated. Deduced amino acids of this cDNA had a high sequence identity ( approximately 95%) to human CYP3A43 cDNA and contained characteristic motifs for CYP3A proteins, heme-binding region and substrate recognition sites. Among 10 tissues analyzed, cynomolgus CYP3A43 was expressed in liver, adrenal gland, and lung, with the highest expression seen in liver. Cynomolgus CYP3A43 protein heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited metabolic activity toward midazolam 1'-hydroxylation. These results indicated that cynomolgus CYP3A43 was expressed in liver and encoded a functional drug-metabolizing enzyme, and could contribute to overall drug metabolism in cynomolgus macaque liver if expressed as a protein.",

Only certain antihistaminic H1 have the marketing authorization for treatment of childhood insomnia. Very few studies have been made in children about the hypnotics that are most widely used in adult patients: zopiclone, zolpidem and the hypnotic benzodiazepines. However, melatonin has recently become the most studied hypnotic drug in children since the marketing of a sustained-released form gave it the status of a drug and improved its pharmacokinetic properties. In child psychiatry, pharmacological treatment of insomnia should be considered in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in which sleep disturbances can be aggravated by psycho stimulant treatment, in autism spectrum disorders, and in the anxiety/depression.",

As a widely prescribed class of medications and abused drugs, benzodiazepines are extensively available. Their sedating and amnesic effects make them effective candidates for use in drug-facilitated assaults. Detection methods for benzodiazepines and their metabolites in biological fluids are plentiful, but methods must be tailored to the low concentrations of drugs and metabolites expected to be encountered in these cases.", 
    "137": "Studies of Melatonin in the 1970s and 1980s revealed sedative and hypnotic properties of the compound, which have led to its use in treating sleep disorders. Commonly used for jet lag, melatonin is relatively inexpensive and associated with minimal side effects. Regulation of melatonin secretion appears to be abnormal in children and adults in which pervasive development disorders have been observed. Alteration in melatonin rhythm may be responsible for sleep-onset and maintenance difficulties in autism. A recent review concluded that melatonin primarily acts on the total length of time needed to fall asleep and on the total length of sleep. In addition, melatonin, which does not induce dependence or withdrawal syndromes, may have advantages compared to commonly prescribed benzodiazepines. While there is an enormous amount of anecdotal information available, additional studies are necessary involving melatonin for the treatment of sleep disorders. The condition of these well-controlled studies must be clearly defined, especially in regards to the melatonin formulation and pharmacology of the products used. Various areas remain unclear, such as how the effects of melatonin vary by age, gender, ethnicity, and comorbid conditions of the population, as well as formulation, timing, and duration of melatonin administration. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and supplements, based on available studies and clinical use, melatonin is generally regarded as safe in recommended doses when used in the short term. The safety of melatonin when used in the long term remains unclear.",

This trial was planned for the patients who developed status epilepticus at least once in the past and had no responses with diazepam. Intranasal midazolam was proved to be effective (complete remission;65%), rapidly (an average time to stop seizures; 5.7 min) and safe with no adverse effects including respiratory depression with this dosage (an average of 0.26 mg/kg). In patients whose longitudinal concentrations of MDL in the blood were measured, MDL level was increased rapidly within five minutes after nasal application. Intranasal MDL is useful as a simple and safe method in the child emergency situation.", 
    "139": "Ramelteon is the first member of a novel class of hypnotics and acts as a selective melatonin receptor agonist. In 2005, ramelteon was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of insomnia characterized by sleep onset problems. Its unique mechanism of action made it a promising candidate compared with the widely used hypnotics that act on the benzodiazepine receptor complex. Several studies have examined its efficacy and safety as a hypnotic agent. The primary efficacy of ramelteon was found to lie in a decrease in latency to persistent sleep, as measured by polysomnographic tests. Other sleep-related measures, such as total sleep time and number of nightly awakenings, show less pronounced improvement when treated with ramelteon. In addition, no rebound insomnia or abuse potential was observed in clinical studies. Although additional studies are necessary, current data on the acute and next-morning effects of ramelteon did not indicate cognitive or psychomotor impairment. Overall, ramelteon is safe and well tolerated, although some questions remain regarding its long-term efficacy and safety. These issues and possibilities for use in other patient groups should be addressed in future research.", 
    "140": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by a circadian variation of symptoms involving an urge to move the limbs (usually the legs) as well as paresthesias. There is a primary (familial) and a secondary (acquired) form, which affects a wide variety of individuals, such as pregnant women, patients with end-stage renal disease, iron deficiency, rheumatic disease, and persons taking medications. The symptoms reflect a circadian fluctuation of dopamine in the substantia nigra. RLS patients have lower dopamine and iron levels in the substantia nigra and respond to both dopaminergic therapy and iron administration. Iron, as a cofactor of dopamine production and a regulator of the expression of dopamine type 2-receptor, has an important role in the RLS etiology. In the management of the disease, the first step is to investigate possible secondary causes and their treatment. Dopaminergic agents are considered as the first-line therapy for moderate to severe RLS. If dopaminergic drugs are contraindicated or not efficacious, or if symptoms are resistant and unremitting, gabapentin or other antiepileptic agents, benzodiazepines, or opioids can be used for RLS therapy. Undiagnosed, wrongly diagnosed, and untreated RLS is associated with a significant impairment of the quality of life.", 
    "141": "Insomnia is a common sleep complaint in the elderly. The safety and efficacy of eszopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, in elderly patients with chronic insomnia has been established in two 2-week and one 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Eszopiclone 1 mg was effective in reducing sleep latency. Eszopiclone 2 mg was effective in reducing latency to sleep and for increasing sleep maintenance. Eszopiclone doses of 1 mg and 2 mg reduced the number of daytime naps and decreased the duration of naps in elderly patients. Eszopiclone 2 mg improved the quality of life measures for mood, physical health, household activities, medication, leisure activities, and self-report of physical functioning and vitality in the 2-week trials, and vitality and general health in the 12-week trial. The most commonly reported side effects in the elderly included unpleasant taste, dry mouth, dizziness, and somnolence. The concurrent use of drugs that inhibit or induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 can alter concentrations of eszopiclone and the dose may need to be adjusted. The recommended starting dose of eszopiclone for difficulty falling asleep is 1 mg at bedtime. For elders who complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, eszopiclone should be initiated at 2 mg at bedtime. Overall, eszopiclone is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option for elderly patients with insomnia.", 
    "142": "Zaleplon is a pyrazolopyrimidine hypnotic used for the treatment of insomnia. Zaleplon binds preferentially at the \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 subunit of gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors in the central nervous system, and has a half-life of about one hour. Efficacy studies show that zaleplon is a suitable hypnotic for sleep initiation purposes. However, because of its short half-life, zaleplon is less effective in sleep maintenance when compared with other hypnotics. Nevertheless, zaleplon does increase total sleep time. No rebound effects are observed after treatment discontinuation. The use of zaleplon is relatively safe. Adverse effects are mild and of short duration. No important interactions have been reported, and there is no evidence of abuse potential. Relative to benzodiazepine hypnotics, the biggest advantage of zaleplon is that current evidence suggests it does not produce residual next-day effects. As early as four hours after intake of zaleplon, no effects on cognitive, memory, psychomotor performance, and the ability to drive a car have been reported. Future studies should confirm these findings, and comparisons with new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics should determine the importance of zaleplon in the future treatment of insomnia.", 
    "143": "Buccal midazolam is a rescue medication to reduce the duration of or stop an epileptic seizure, and is used to prevent status epilepticus. It is available in various forms, including a buccal preparation with a strength of 10 mg/1 ml. Midazolam is a licensed medication, but the buccal formulation is currently used off-licence. The prescriber takes ultimate responsibility for its use in this way. Administered by a trained person, it is receiving widespread acceptance as an alternative and effective treatment to rectally-administered diazepam in the community. The commonest side effects of midazolam are drowsiness and somnolence, although respiratory depression and paradoxical reactions, for example, agitation, restlessness and disorientation, may also occur. Hypotension is said to be a rare side effect, but with no reported cases in people administered buccal midazolam. The authors report a case of significant hypotension associated with administration of buccal midazolam for seizure management.", 
    "144": "Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a difficult disease for patients and clinicians. Moreover, there is not a general consensus on how to treat the disease. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate BMS patients' response to topical clonazepam treatment. A double blind study was performed. Among a total of 66 patients, 33 were treated with tablets of clonazepam and another 33 were treated with a placebo. Symptoms were evaluated after 1 month and 6 months of treatment and scored on an analogical scale from 0 to 10. Among the 33 patients treated with clonazepam, 23 showed at least a 50% reduction in symptoms after 1 month of treatment. On the contrary, only 4 in the placebo group exhibited significant improvement. After 6 months, significant differences were observed again, as 23 of the 33 patients treated with the drug reported at least a 50% reduction in symptoms, whereas only 2 among those treated with the placebo significantly improved. However, when measured in terms of a complete cure (lack of symptoms), the differences were not significant: 5 drug-treated patients and one belonging to the placebo group were asymptomatic after one month of treatment. In summary, it seems that clonazepam applied topically was effective in treating BMS in a large proportion of patients.",

    "147": "Over two dozen case series and clinical studies have documented the utility of dexmedetomidine as a sedative in children requiring mechanical ventilation or procedural sedation. In several papers, dexmedetomidine use resulted in a reduction in the dose or discontinuation of other sedative agents. It may be of particular benefit in children with neurologic impairment or in those who do not tolerate benzodiazepines. The most frequent adverse effects reported with dexmedetomidine have been hypotension and bradycardia, in 10% to 20% of patients. These effects typically resolve with dose reduction.", 
    "148": "Dexmedetomidine offers an additional choice for the sedation of children receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care setting or requiring procedural sedation. While dexmedetomidine is well tolerated when used at recommended doses, it has the potential to cause hypotension and bradycardia and requires close monitoring. In addition to clinical trials currently underway, larger controlled studies are needed to further define the role of dexmedetomidine in pediatric intensive care.",

Two juvenile females were discovered unresponsive and hypoxic by a male acquaintance. The trio had reportedly crushed and snorted Opana ER tablets and consumed Xanax for recreational purposes. Emergency personnel were able to stabilize one female. The second female was pronounced dead at the scene. Blood and urine samples from the surviving female were collected at the trauma center between 48 and 96 h post incident. Toxicology results showed the presence of oxymorphone, doxylamine, dextromethorphan, alprazolam, \u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam, oxazepam, and temazepam in her urine. No drugs were detected in her blood. Toxicology on the deceased female revealed the presence of 0.13 mg/L oxymorphone and 0.04 mg/L alprazolam in her blood. Gastric contents contained 0.25 and 0.93 mg/L of oxymorphone and alprazolam, respectively. Oxymorphone, alprazolam, and \u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam were present in her urine. Quantitative results were achieved by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry monitoring selected ions for the oxime-oxymorphone-trimethylsilyl derivative, alprazolam, and the \u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivative. The established linearity ranges for the opiate and benzodiazepine methods were 0.050-3.000 and 0.025-1.000 mg/L, respectively.

    "151": "Skeletal tissues from a domestic pig exposed to amitriptyline, diazepam, and pentobarbital were analyzed to determine the relative distribution of these drugs in bone. Following drug exposure and euthanasia, remains were allowed to decompose outdoors to complete skeletonization between summer 2007 and fall 2009. Remains were recovered and separated according to bone type. Twelve different bone types were pulverized and sampled in triplicate. Each bone sample underwent methanolic extraction (96 h, 50 \u00b0C), followed by solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode. Mass-normalized assay responses underwent ANOVA with post-hoc testing, revealing bone type as a main effect for all three drugs, but not for the diazepam metabolite (nordiazepam). The assay response varied with respect to bone type by factors of 27, 39, and 20 for pentobarbital, diazepam, and amitriptyline, respectively. The relative distribution between bone type was qualitatively similar for the three administered drugs analyzed for, with the largest response obtained from rib for all three drugs. This is the first study, to the authors' knowledge, of the distribution of different drugs in various decomposed skeletal tissues in a controlled experiment using an animal model of comparable physiology to humans. These data have implications for the interpretive value of forensic drug measurements in skeletal tissues.",
