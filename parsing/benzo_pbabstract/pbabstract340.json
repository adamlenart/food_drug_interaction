These receptors are sensitive to muscimol and benzodiazepines and appear to be important in the regulation of the feeding response. The effects of neurosteroids, general anaesthetics, and GABA antagonists on GABA(A) receptors in membranes prepared from Hydra and on the feeding response have now been investigated. The neurosteroids tetrahydroprogesterone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone increased [3H]GABA binding to hydra membranes with nanomolar potency (EC50, 141+/-11 and 623+/-36 nM, respectively) and high efficacy (maximal increase 79+/-6.5 and 62+/-4%, respectively), whereas the 3beta-hydroxy epimer of tetrahydroprogesterone was ineffective. The benzodiazepine receptor ligands diazepam (100 microM), clonazepam (100 microM) and abecarnil (30 microM) enhanced [3H]GABA binding to Hydra membranes by 22, 20 and 24%, respectively; effects abolished by the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (100 microM). On the contrary, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand 4'chlorodiazepam failed to affect [3H]GABA binding to Hydra membranes. The general anaesthetics propofol and alphaxalone similarly increased (+38% and +30% respectively) [3H]GABA binding. Moreover, [3H]GABA binding to Hydra membranes was completely inhibited by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist SR 95531, whereas bicuculline was without effect. The modulation of GABA(A) receptors in vitro by these various drugs correlated with their effects on the glutathione-induced feeding response in the living animals. Tetrahydroprogesterone and tetrahydrodeoxy-corticosterone (1 to 10 microM) prolonged, in a dose-dependent manner, the duration of mouth opening induced by 10 microM glutathione, with maximal effects of +33 and +29%, respectively, apparent at 10 microM neurosteroid. Alphaxalone (10 microM) similarly increased (+33%) the effect of glutathione. The effects of steroids on the feeding response were inhibited by SR 95531 in a dose-dependent manner; t-butylbyclophosphorothyonate (1 microM), a specific Cl- channel blocker, which per se, like picrotoxin but not bicuculline, shortened the duration of the response, also counteracted the steroids effects at 1 microM. These results suggest that the modulation of GABA(A) receptors by steroids is an ancient characteristic of the animal kingdom and that the pharmacological properties of these receptors have been highly conserved through evolution.", 
    "1": "A stable cell line expressing the human cholecystokinin-B receptor gene (hCCK-B.CHO) has been employed in an evaluation of the recently developed CCK-B receptor antagonist L-740,093. L-740,093 exhibited high affinity (IC50 0.49 nM) and selectivity (<50% displacement at CCK-A sites at 1 microM) for the human CCK-B receptor subtype as estimated from [125I]-CCK-8S displacement studies with membranes prepared from hCCK-B.CHO cells. The elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ in hCCK-B.CHO cells in response to stimulation with CCK-4 was used to evaluate the antagonist activity of L-740,093 in vitro. L-740,093 potently (IC50 5.4 nM) antagonized the 30 nM CCK-4-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in hCCK-B.CHO cells. Further studies were performed to investigate the nature of the antagonist activity of L-740,093. When tested at 10 nM L-740,093 produced a modest rightward shift in the CCK-4 dose response curve, an effect which was accompanied by a small reduction (13%) in the maximum response to CCK-4. In the presence of 30 nM L-740,093 the maximum functional response to CCK-4 was further reduced by 45% indicating that L-740,093 behaves as an insurmountable antagonist of the human CCK-B receptor subtype.", 
    "2": "A kinetic study on the acidic hydrolysis of bromazepam was carried out in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid solution at 25 and 95 degrees C. A reversed-phase HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of bromazepam and its degradation products. Bromazepam degraded by a consecutive reaction with a reversible first step. Two degradation products were isolated and identified by infrared, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. Spectroscopic data indicated that N-(4-bromo-2-(2-pyridylcarbonyl)phenyl)-2-aminoacetamide was the intermediate degradation product of this acid hydrolysis, whereas 2-amino-5-bromophenyl-2-pyridylmethanone was the final one. Therefore, the mechanism of this acid-catalysed hydrolysis involved initial cleavage of the 4,5-azomethine bond, followed by slow breakage of the 1,2-amide bond. Statistical evaluation of the HPLC method revealed its good linearity and reproducibility. Detection limits were 3.8 x 10(-7) M for bromazepam, 6.25 x 10(-7) M for the intermediate and 8.16 x 10(-7) M for the benzophenone derivative.",

The disposition of radiocarbon was determined and tissue pharmacokinetics evaluated in male Fischer 344 rats following a single oral 8 mg/kg dose at 2, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postdose using quantitative whole-body autoradiographic (QWBA) techniques in conjunction with image analysis. This study demonstrated that [14C]olanzapine and/or metabolites were rapidly absorbed and widely distributed with a tmax of 2 h postdose in most tissues. Persistent but declining concentrations of radiocarbon were detected in feces, kidney, liver, and Harderian, preputial, and thyroid glands at 96 h postdose. Placental transfer of [14C]olanzapine was evaluated at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h postdose on gestation day 12, the mid-point of organogenesis, by tissue dissection and liquid scintillation spectroscopy (LSC) and on gestation day 18, a time which enabled visualization of fetal tissues by whole-body autoradiography (WBA). The placental transfer studies indicated that all tissues analyzed had a tmax of 1 or 3 h postdose with maternal liver consistently containing high concentrations of radiocarbon. Embryos contained measurable concentrations of radiocarbon throughout the time course of these studies confirming that [14C]olanzapine and/or its metabolites crossed the placenta. Additionally, the disposition of [14C]olanzapine in milk and plasma of lactating female CD rats confirmed pup exposure through milk ingestion.",

    "5": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of home-based treatment for acute repetitive seizures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either rectal diazepam gel, at a dosage varying from 0.2 to 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight on the basis of age, or placebo. Children received one dose at the onset of acute repetitive seizures and a second dose four hours later. Adults received three doses -- one dose at onset, and two more doses 4 and 12 hours after onset. Treatment was administered by a care giver, such as a parent, who had received special training. The number of seizures after the first dose was counted for 12 hours in children and for 24 hours in adults.", 
    "6": "Of 125 study patients (64 assigned to diazepam and 61 to placebo) with a history of acute repetitive seizures, 91 (47 children and 44 adults) were treated for an exacerbation of seizures during the study period. Diazepam treatment was superior to placebo with regard to the outcome variables related to efficacy: reduced seizure frequency (P<0.001) and improved global assessment of treatment outcome by the care giver (frequency and severity of seizures and drug toxicity) (P<0.001). Post hoc analysis showed diazepam to be superior to placebo in reducing seizure frequency in both children (P<0.001) and adults (P=0.02), but only in children was it superior with regard to improvement in global outcome (P<0.001). The time to the first recurrence of seizures after initial treatment was longer for the patients receiving diazepam (P<0.001). Thirty-five patients reported at least one adverse effect of treatment; somnolence was the most frequent. Respiratory depression was not reported.",

    "8": "One critical step of the apoptotic process is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore leading to the disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity and to the dissipation of the inner transmembrane proton gradient (Delta Psim). The mitochondrial PT pore is a polyprotein structure which is inhibited by the apoptosis-inhibitory oncoprotein Bcl-2 and which is closely associated with the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR). Here we show that PK11195, a prototypic ligand of the 18-kDa mBzR, facilitates the induction of Delta Psim disruption and subsequent apoptosis by a number of different agents,including agonists of the glucocorticoid receptor,chemotherapeutic agents (etoposide, doxorubicin),gamma irradiation, and the proapoptotic second messenger ceramide. Whereas PK11195 itself has no cytotoxic effect, it enhances apoptosis induction by these agents. This effect is not observed for benzodiazepine diazepam, whose binding site in the mBzR differs from PK11195. PK11195 partially reverses Bcl-2 mediated inhibition of apoptosis in two different cell lines. Thus, transfection-enforced Bcl-2 overexpression confers protection against glucocorticoids and chemotherapeutic agents, and this protection is largely reversed by the addition of PK11195. This effect is observed at the level of Delta Psim dissipation as well as at the level of nuclear apoptosis. To gain insights into the site of action of PK11195, we performed experiments on isolated organelles. PK11195 reverses the Bcl-2-mediated mitochondrial retention of apoptogenic factors which cause isolated nuclei to undergo apoptosis in a cell-free system. Mitochondria from control cells, but not mitochondria from Bcl-2-overexpressing cells, readily release such apoptogenic factors in response to atractyloside, a ligand of the adenine nucleotide translocator. However, control and Bcl-2-overexpressing mitochondria respond equally well to a combination of atractyloside and PK11195. Altogether, these findings indicate that PK11195 abolishes apoptosis inhibition by Bcl-2 via a direct effect on mitochondria. Moreover, they suggest a novel strategy for enhancing the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis induction and, concomitantly, for reversing Bcl-2-mediated cytoprotection.", 
    "9": "Kainic acid (KA) has long been used in experimental animals to induce status epilepticus (SE). A mechanistic implication of this is the association between excitotoxicity and brain damage during or after SE. We evaluated KA-induced metabolic impairment and the potential mitigating effects of GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine] in superfused rat cerebral cortical slices.",

    "11": "In the absence of GYKI 52466 and during the KA exposure, NAA, PCr, and ATP levels were decreased to 91.1 +/- 0.8, 62.4 +/- 3.9, and 59.1 +/- 4.3% of the control, respectively; Lac was increased to 118.2 +/- 2.1 %, and pH, was reduced from 7.27 +/- 0.02 to 7.13 +/- 0.02. During 4-h recovery with KA-free ACSF, pHi rapidly and Lac gradually recovered, NAA decreased further to 85.5 +/- 0.3%, and PCr and ATP showed little recovery. Removal of Mg2+ from ACSF during KA exposure caused a more profound Lac increase (to 147.1 +/- 4.0%) during KA exposure and a further NAA decrease (to 80.4 +/- 0.5%) during reperfusion, but did not exacerbate PCr, ATP, and pHi changes. Inclusion of 100 microM GYKI 52466 during KA exposure significantly improved energy metabolism: the PCr and ATP levels were above 76.6 +/- 2.1 and 82.0 +/- 2.9% of the control, respectively, during KA exposure and recovered to 101.4 +/- 2.4 and 95.0 +/- 2.4%, respectively, during reperfusion.

Continuous treatment of mice with nicotine significantly increased DBI content and its mRNA expression, which was completely abolished by simultaneous administration of mecamylamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.).

    "14": "Human NT2 teratocarcinoma cells differentiate into neuron-like NT2-N cells when treated with retinoic acid. GABA evoked concentration-dependent whole-cell currents in NT2-N cells with an EC50 of 21.8 microM and a Hill slope of 1.2. GABAA receptor (GABAR) currents reversed at ECl- and did not display voltage-dependent rectification. GABAR single channels opened in bursts to a 23 pS main conductance level and a 19 pS subconductance level, with infrequent openings to a 27 pS conductance level. Kinetic properties of the main conductance level were similar to other native and recombinant GABAR channels. Diazepam and zolpidem enhanced GABAR currents with moderate affinity, whereas methyl-6, 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate inhibited GABAR currents. Loreclezole enhanced GABAR currents with high affinity, but furosemide antagonized GABAR currents with low affinity. The neurosteroids alphaxalone and pregnenolone sulfate appropriately modulated GABAR currents. Zinc blocked GABAR currents with low affinity, but lanthanum did not significantly alter NT2-N GABAR currents. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) performed on RNA from NT2-N cells clearly detected transcripts encoding human alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta3, gamma3, and pi subtypes. The combined pharmacological and RT-PCR results are most consistent with a single or predominant GABAR isoform composed of an alpha2 and/or alpha3 subtype combined with the beta3 and gamma3 subtypes. The data do not rule out receptors containing combinations of alpha2 and/or alpha3 subtypes with the alpha5 subtype or receptors with both beta1 and beta3 subtypes. The presence or absence or the pi subunit in functionally expressed receptors could not be determined.", 
    "15": "The human cytochrome P450 2B6 metabolizes, among numerous other substrates, diazepam, 7-ethoxycoumarin, testosterone, and phenanthrene. A recombinant baculovirus containing the human 2B6 cDNA was constructed and used to express 2B6 in Sf9 insect cells. The 2B6 was present at 1.8 +/- 0.4% of the total cellular protein and was purified to a specific content of 13.3 nmol/mg protein. Mice were immunized with the purified 2B6, and a total of 811 hybridomas were obtained from the fusion of NS-1 myeloma cells and spleen cells of the immunized mice. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from 24 of the hybrids exhibited immunobinding to 2B6 as determined by ELISA. One of the MAbs, 49-10-20, showed a strong immunoblotting activity and was highly inhibitory to 2B6 enzyme activity. MAb 49-10-20 inhibited cDNA-expressed 2B6-catalyzed metabolism of diazepam, phenanthrene, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and testosterone by 90-91%. MAb 49-10-20 showed extremely high specificity for 2B6 and did not bind to 17 other human and rodent P450s or inhibit the metabolism of phenanthrene catalyzed by human 1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, and 3A5. MAb 49-10-20 was used to determine the contribution of 2B6 to the metabolism of phenanthrene and diazepam in human liver. In ten liver samples, MAb 49-10-20 inhibited phenanthrene metabolism variably by a wide range of 8-42% and diazepam demethylation by 1-23%. The degree of inhibition by the 2B6 specific MAb 49-10-20 defines the contribution of 2B6 to phenanthrene and diazepam metabolism in each human liver. This technique using inhibitory MAb 49-10-20 determines the contribution of 2B6 to the metabolism of its substrates in a human tissue containing multiple P450s. This study is a prototype for the use of specific and highly inhibitory MAbs to determine individual P450 function.", 
    "16": "To investigate the endocrine stress response in patients undergoing major surgery with general anesthesia using a balanced technique with sufentanil, isoflurane and midazolam up to the second postoperative day, blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, prolactin and growth hormone were determined in 68 males for elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Intraoperatively, during extracorporeal circulation none of the measured parameters were significantly increased compared to preoperative values. The endocrine response of patients with perioperative epinephrine medication (n = 32) was not significant different to patients that did not receive exogenous epinephrine (n = 36). On the evening of the day of surgery, levels of cortisol (3 fold), epinephrine (4.7 fold), norepinephrine (1.7 fold) and growth hormone (16.5 fold) were significantly increased. Compared to preoperative values levels of cortisol (3.3 fold), growth hormone (5.5 fold) and norepinephrine (1.8 fold) remained elevated up to the evening of the second postoperative day. In conclusion, the endocrine stress response in patients undergoing CABG-surgery under general anesthesia with sufentanil, midazolam, isoflurane is intraoperatively prevented by anesthesia. Although hemodilution or hormone degradation might be responsible for the lack of an increase in endocrine parameters during CPB, this study indicates that a balanced technique with isoflurane, sufentanil and midazolam is more effective in blocking the endocrine stress response than previously described anesthetic techniques. In the early postoperative period, a sharp increase in cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and growth hormone occurred suggesting that the predominant endocrine stress response begins in the intensive care unit with end of anesthesia. The postoperative elevated levels of cortisol, growth hormone and norepinephrine indicate a persisting stress-response for more than two days after surgical trauma.", 
    "17": "A case report of a patient with amineptine and midazolam dependence is presented. A literature search was done for other cases of amineptine abuse and their presentations and medical investigations are compared. This is the first locally reported case of amineptine abuse and highlights the fact that amineptine is a potential drug of abuse.", 
    "18": "This study examined the effects of posttraining administration of substance P (SP) and of certain N- or C-terminal SP-fragments on retention performance of rats treated with diazepam (DZP). Twenty minutes before the training on an inhibitory avoidance task rats were given intraperitoneal injections of either DZP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle. Immediately after they were injected with SP (50 micrograms/kg), SPN 1-7 (167 micrograms/kg), SPC 6-11 (134 micrograms/kg), or vehicle. The posttrial administration of SP and SPN, but not SPC, facilitated avoidance behavior. Animals that received DZP before training and vehicle after the conditioning trial showed impaired retention. In contrast, in animals injected with SP and SPN after the training trial, DZP did not affect retention. These findings suggest that the amnestic effects of DZP can be blocked by the administration of SP and that the amino acid sequence responsible for this effect may be encoded by its N-terminal part.", 
    "19": "The significance of N-linked glycosylation and oligosaccharide processing was examined for the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor (GABA(A)R) in cultured neurons derived from chick embryo brains. Incubation of cultures with 5 microg/ml of tunicamycin for 24 h blocked the binding of 3H-flunitrazepam and 3H-muscimol, probes for the benzodiazepine and GABA sites on the receptor, by about 20% and 28%, respectively. The loss of ligand binding was due to a reduction in the number of binding sites with no significant changes in receptor affinity. Light microscopic immunocytochemistry also revealed that the treatment reduced approximately 13% of the intensity of GABA(A)R immunoreactivity in the neuronal somata. Furthermore, the fraction of intracellular receptors was decreased to 24% from 34% of control in the presence of the agent, as revealed by trypsinization of cells in situ followed by 3H-flunitrazepam binding. The molecular weight of the receptor subunit protein was lowered around 0.5 kDa after tunicamycin treatment, in accordance with that following N-glycosidase F digestion, indicating the blockade of N-linked glycosylation of GABA(A)R by tunicamycin. Moreover, intense inhibitions of 91% and 44%, respectively, were detected to the general galactosylation and mannosylation in the tunicamycin-treated cells, whereas the protein synthesis was hindered by 13%, through assaying the incorporation of 3H-sugars and 3H-leucine. Nevertheless, treatment with castanospermine or swainsonine (10 microg/ml, 24 h), inhibitors to maturation of oligosaccharides, failed to produce significant changes in the ligand binding. In addition, in situ hybridization analysis showed that these three inhibitors did not perturb the mRNA of GABA(A)Ralpha1-subunit. The data suggest that tunicamycin causes the downregulation and subcellular redistribution of GABA(A)R by producing irregularly glycosylated receptors and modifying their localization. Both galactosylation and mannosylation during the process of N-linked glycosylation may be important for the functional expression and intracellular transport of GABA(A)R.", 
    "20": "Social transmission of a food preference in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) depends on the presence of a social bond between the interacting animals. An \"observer\" gerbil can acquire a preference for a novel food item from a familiar and, or related \"demonstrator\" animal. However, exposure to an unfamiliar and unrelated demonstrator gerbil does not lead to acquisition of a food preference, even though the extent of social interaction and likelihood of transmission of food information is unaffected. Likewise, individual preexposure to a novel food does not affect diet preference in individual animals. Here we show that oral, nongavage, administration of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazcpoxide (CDP, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) has significant dose-associated differential facilitatory effects on social learning in male and female gerbils, while having no significant effects on either individual learning or total food consumption. These results suggest that the CDP mediated reduction of the anxiety associated with the interactions between unfamiliar/unrelated gerbils facilitates social learning. These findings also rise the possibility of sex differences in socially related anxiety and the effects of CDP on social learning in gerbils.", 
    "21": "Food deprivation increases the rewarding effects of self-administered drugs such as psychomotor stimulants and benzodiazepines. These drugs also possess aversive properties and can produce conditioned taste aversions (CTA). Because drug-seeking behavior is most likely affected by both the rewarding and aversive properties of drugs, we hypothesize that food deprivation might also attenuate a drug's aversive consequences. The CTAs induced by three different drugs (amphetamine, chlordiazepoxide, and LiCl) were assessed separately. Male Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two feeding conditions: restricted (maintained at 80% of free-feeding body weight), or nonrestricted (with ad lib food). Both groups received CTA training, consisting of an intraoral infusion of a novel saccharin solution (10 min) followed immediately by one of two i.p. injections: paired rats received drug, and unpaired rats received a similar volume of saline. After 10 days of ad lib food access, saccharin was presented to all rats again, and the latency to reject the tastant was used as an index of CTA learning. The rats that had been food restricted at the time of conditioning exhibited attenuated CTAs relative to those that had not been deprived. These differences were seen only when a rewarding drug (amphetamine or chlordiazepoxide) and not when a nonrewarding drug (LiCl) was used as the unconditioned stimulus. In a separate experiment, we established that this effect is apparent only when the deprivation period precedes conditioning rather than precedes testing. The present results indicate that food deprivation modulates the acquisition of a CTA induced by amphetamine or chlordiazepoxide, but not LiCl.", 
    "22": "The rat has proven to be a valuable preclinical model for characterizing effects of psychotrophic drugs and for identifying new psychotherapeutic agents in pharmacological screens. However, substantial differences have been described between the rat and human brain in regard to the neuroanatomical distribution of some drug and neurotransmitter receptor binding sites. To assess the utility of the rat as a model for the neuroanatomical topography of 5-HT1A and type 1 benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors in humans, the distribution of binding sites for 3H-8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A agonist) and 3H-zolpidem (type 1 BDZ agonist) was compared with autoradiography in select regions of the rat and human brain. Concordance in the binding patterns for the two ligands was observed in several brain regions for the two species. However, substantial differences were also found in the topography of binding sites for the ligands in the rat and human brain. High 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding was seen in the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampal formation in both the rat and human brain. However, species differences were observed in the relative distribution of ligand binding among hippocampal subregions. In the cerebral cortex, the laminar distribution of 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding sites was notably different for rats and humans. In humans, outer cortical layers were most densely labeled with 3H-8-OH-DPAT, whereas in the rat cortex, the highest binding was in the inner layers. A striking difference between rats and humans was observed for 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding in the lateral septal nucleus, which was densely labeled in the rat but weakly labeled in humans. Substantial differences between rats and humans were also observed for 3H-zolpidem binding. In the rat brain, high densities of binding sites were found in the medial septum, inferior colliculus, and substantia nigra reticulata. These regions showed very low 3H-zolpidem binding in the human brain. Intermediate binding was seen in the rat cerebral cortex, and low binding was found in the hippocampus. By contrast, in humans, cerebral cortical regions were the most densely labeled of all regions studied, and certain hippocampal subregions exhibited relatively high binding. The striking neuroanatomical differences in 3H-8-OH-DPAT and 3H-zolpidem binding observed between rats and humans suggest that different functional consequences may be produced within specific brain regions after administration of drugs that influence 5-HT1A and type 1 BZD receptors.", 
    "23": "Repeated alcohol withdrawal has been shown to kindle seizure activity. The purpose of the present investigation was to study electrical amygdala kindling in rats previously exposed to alcohol-withdrawal kindling. In three independent experiments, male Wistar rats were subjected to multiple episodes each consisting of 2 days of severe alcohol intoxication and 5 days of alcohol withdrawal. In the first experiment, the alcohol-withdrawal kindled animals were divided into two groups depending on whether spontaneous alcohol-withdrawal seizures were observed in episodes 10-13. In the second and third experiments, the alcohol-withdrawal kindled animals were compared to a group in which alcohol-withdrawal kindling was prevented by diazepam treatment during the withdrawal reactions in order to discriminate between the effect of withdrawal and intoxication. Electrical kindling was initiated 28-35 days after the last alcohol dose by exposing the animals to daily electrical stimulations of the right amygdala. The results showed that amygdala kindling was facilitated in alcohol-withdrawal kindled animals which showed spontaneous withdrawal seizure activity, compared with animals exposed to multiple episodes of alcohol withdrawal which did not develop withdrawal seizures or with animals exposed to a single episode of alcohol intoxication. When compared to the control group, the alcohol-withdrawal kindled group with seizures also kindled at a faster rate, but the difference did not reach statistical significance and therefore the results must be regarded as preliminary at present.", 
    "24": "In order to investigate whether alcohol-withdrawal kindling is an irreversible process, male Wistar rats were exposed to 12 episodes, each consisting of 2 days of severe alcohol intoxication and 5 days of alcohol withdrawal. Spontaneous withdrawal seizures were found in 15% of the animals during episodes 10-12. After an alcohol-free period of 26 days, the animals were subjected to three more episodes of alcohol dependence (i.e. episodes 13-15) in which 12% of the animals developed spontaneous withdrawal seizures. Based on several statistical tests, we concluded that there was no true difference between the seizure activity in episodes 10-12 and episodes 13-15, indicating that alcohol-withdrawal kindling is a long-lasting and perhaps irreversible process. In a second experiment, an alcohol-withdrawal kindled group was first exposed to seven episodes of alcohol dependence. A diazepam group went through the same alcohol regimen, but each withdrawal reaction was blocked by diazepam treatment. Finally, a single episode group was included which was fed isocalorically with the kindled animals. After an alcohol-free period of 11 days, all three groups were subjected to 4 days of severe alcohol intoxication. During the subsequent withdrawal reaction seizures were observed in 22-26% of the animals with no significant differences across the groups. These results call for a modification of the kindling hypothesis of alcohol withdrawal and suggest that kindling-induced alterations may be overlooked if convulsive behaviour is tested during a relatively strong withdrawal reaction.", 
    "25": "This paper reports the effects of a diazepam treatment on voluntary ethanol intake in rats included in an animal model of alcoholism. In a first dose-seeking experiment, rats had a choice between 10% (w/v) ethanol and water for 24 h each week. Single doses of diazepam between 2 and 20 mg/kg injected i.p. prior to the 24-h choice caused a dose-dependent decrease in voluntary ethanol intake from 3.2 +/- 0.4 g/kg/day down to 2.3 +/- 0.3 g/kg/day (P < 0.01) after a dose of 20 mg/kg. In a second experiment, psychological dependence was induced by a 1-year intermittent exposure to ethanol (a choice between 10% ethanol and water for 24 h each week, followed by an i.p. injection of 2.0 g/kg of ethanol). After this year, the rats were given a continuous choice between ethanol and water. A 3-week treatment with diazepam (20 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was started in week 68, during which period a choice of 10% (w/v) ethanol was available only on the first and the last days of treatment. On the first day of the diazepam treatment, ethanol intake was decreased from a pre-experimental value of 2.7 +/- 0.3 g/kg/day to 1.2 +/- 0.1 g/kg/day (P < 0.001). On the last day of the treatment, voluntary intake was higher than before the treatment (3.8 +/- 0.27 g/kg/day, P < 0.01). Ethanol intake remained elevated during the week after the end of the diazepam treatment (P < 0.05). When single doses of diazepam (20 mg/kg) were re-tested 10 and 19 weeks after the treatment, there was no decrease in ethanol intake, indicating that the initial effect had not been re-established.", 
    "26": "Immunoassays designed to detect use of older benzodiazepines such as oxazepam or diazepam often cannot detect triazolam use because of the low doses of triazolam administered, rapid biotransformation to metabolites with poor cross-reactivities, and the small amount of alpha OH triazolam glucuronide excreted in the urine. Previous studies have demonstrated that certain immunoassays have high cross-reactivity to alpha OH triazolam but are unable to detect therapeutic triazolam use in urine. The objectives of this study were to characterize the immunoreactivity toward alpha OH triazolam in the reformulated cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA) drug abuse urine benzodiazepine assay and to measure the immunoreactivity of urine specimens from subjects who were administered single oral doses of triazolam. Alpha OH triazolam standards were prepared in drug-free urine and the new CEDIA assay gave a positive result at concentrations from 100 to 200 ng/ml, which indicates an eight-fold improvement in CEDIA cross-reactivity to alpha OH triazolam standards in the reformulated CEDIA assay. With a 200 ng/ml cut-off, 4/30 of the urine specimens screened positive for benzodiazepines without enzymatic hydrolysis and 6/30 after enzymatic hydrolysis. When using an in-house 100 ng/ml nitrazepam cut-off calibrator, 10/30 urine specimens were positive in the reformulated CEDIA assay without hydrolysis and 22/30 were positive with enzymatic hydrolysis before screening.", 
    "27": "Hydroxylation of midazolam (MDZ) is mediated almost exclusively by CYP3A isoforms. The authors describe a high-performance liquid chromatography assay involving MDZ, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, and 4-hydroxymidazolam in plasma. The compounds were eluted on an Ultrasphere ODS, 3-microm particle size, 7.5 cm x 4.6 mm reversed-phase column and monitored by ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm. The composition of the mobile phase was 35.2% acetonitrile:4.8% methanol:60% buffer acetate (vol/vol/vol), 0.1 M, pH 4.7; the flow rate was 1 ml/minute. Calibration curves were linear (coefficients of correlation > 0.99) within the range of concentrations established (20 to 640 nM). Within- and between-day coefficients of variation were consistently better than 8%. The overall recovery was >90% and the lowest detectable concentration was 8 nM. This approach provides a simple, rapid, and sensitive assessment of MDZ and metabolites in plasma, with a very good accuracy and precision, which enables it as an in vivo marker of CYP3A activity in humans.", 
    "28": "Children and adolescents with severe asthma frequently experience anxiety or depression with anxiety, which can undermine their response to treatment. In addition, these patients often receive theophylline and a variety of adrenergic stimulants, which can exacerbate or worsen anxiety. Such children occasionally are candidates for treatment with anxiolytic therapy. There is a paucity of drug disposition data in adolescents for benzodiazepines, the most frequently used antianxiety drugs. The authors monitored the steady state alprazolam plasma concentration in six children with severe asthma who were administered standard doses of alprazolam. In one patient administered concurrent therapy with troleandomycin, a recognized cytochrome 3A4 inhibitor, alprazolam plasma concentration was markedly elevated. Overall, the disposition data of alprazolam was consistent with data previously reported in adults. Alprazolam appeared to be safe and effective for use in adolescents with asthma.", 
    "29": "206 patients scheduled for spinal surgery (lumbar discopathy) were randomly premedicated with diclofenac, pethidine, diazepam or hydroxizine. The frequency of persisted postoperative pain was evaluated from the 3-ed. postoperative day to the end of hospitalisation--as the need for additional concomitant treatment with dexamethasone and intravenous analgesics. The frequency of persisted pain was significantly decreased in patients premedicated with diclofenac (together with diazepam) before spinal surgery (limited to fenestration) in comparison to patients premedicated with pethidine. The pre-emptive analgesic effect of diclofenac was even more evident in patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) before surgery, but was not observed in patients after more traumatic surgery (laminectomy) premedicated with diazepam. The results are supporting the important role of NSAID given before surgery to decrease the frequency of persisted pain after spinal surgery (limited to fenestration), in patients treated with NSAID.", 
    "30": "To determine whether age-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations account for a more pronounced response to benzodiazepines among elderly patients.", 
    "31": "Twelve young patients and 10 elderly patients received an intravenous dose of 0.05 or 0.03 mg/kg midazolan, respectively, before third molar extraction. Postoperative pain was treated with 30 mg dihydrocodeine. Serum concentrations of midazolam and sedative effects were monitored with visual analog scales and choice reaction time measurements for 6 hours. Test values above baseline were integrated, and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed. Heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and amnesia also were assessed.", 
    "32": "There were no significant age-dependent differences in disposition of midazolam between young and elderly patients (apparent volume of distribution, 1.3 +/- 0.2 versus 1.1 +/- 0.4 L/kg; halflife, 3.3 +/- 1.5 hours versus 3.7 +/- 2.2 hours; total body clearance, 451 +/- 186 ml/min versus 343 +/- 137 ml/min). However, higher values of area under the effect curve (AUEC) and AUEC divided by area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) (sensitivity index) were observed among the elderly as follows: AUEC for reaction time (AUECRT) (573 versus 261; p = 0.042), AUEC for visual analog scale (AUECVAS) (37.7 versus 14.4; p = 0.011), AUECRT/AUC (6.3 versus 1.8; p = 0.007), and AUECVAS/AUC (0.40 versus 0.11; p = 0.009) compared with the young group. Likewise, mean concentration at half-maximal effect for sedation was lower (p = 0.025) among older patients (20.5 +/- 2.2 ng/ml) than among younger (29.7 +/- 6.6 ng/ml) patients. Amnesia was observed among 86% of patients and oxygen saturation was always 95% or more of basal value. There were no age-related differences in concentration of dihydrocodeine and its active metabolite dihydromorphine, but dihydromorphone levels were much lower in there intermediate metabolizers (455 to 879 fmol/l) and especially in five poor metabolizers (65 to 498 fmol/L) than among extensive metabolizer of cytochrome p450 2D6 (1604 to 6490 fmol/L).", 
    "33": "Elderly patients are more sensitive to the sedative action of midazolam than young patients, and the sensitivity is caused by age-dependent pharmacodynamic alterations. The age-adjusted doses used are both effective (for sedative amnesia) and safe (in terms of arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure.", 
    "34": "The postsynaptic responses of sign-preserving second-order retinal neurons (horizontal cells (HCs) and off-bipolar cells) are mediated by CNQX-sensitive AMPA/KA glutamate receptors. In this study we used receptor-specific allosteric regulators of desensitization and selected antagonists to determine the glutamate receptor subtypes in tiger salamander horizontal cells. Two approaches were employed in this study. The first was to measure postsynaptic currents induced by exogenously applied glutamate under voltage clamp conditions in living retinal slices; and the second was to record voltage responses controlled by endogenous glutamate released from photoreceptors in whole retinas. Application of 100 microM cyclothiazide (a specific AMPA receptor desensitization blocker) enhanced the glutamate-induced current by about 5 fold. In contrast, 300 microgram ml-1 Co nA (a specific kainate receptor desensitization blocker), had no effect. GYKI 52466 (a specific AMPA receptor antagonist) at 30 microM almost completely suppressed the glutamate-induced inward current in HCs. Cyclothiazide at 100 microM depolarized the HC dark membrane potential by about 5 mV and reduced the amplitudes of the voltage responses to dim lights, but enhanced the voltage responses to bright lights. Cyclothiazide had no effect on either the dark potential or the light responses of rods and cones. Con A at 300 microgram ml-1 had no effect on either the dark potential or the light responses of the HC. GYKI 52466 (30 microM) hyperpolarized the HC dark membrane potential by about 55 mV and almost completely suppressed the light responses. We conclude from these results that the postsynaptic glutamate- and light-induced responses in the tiger salamander retinal horizontal cells are mediated by AMPA-preferring, and not kainate-preferring glutamate receptors. The functional roles of AMPA receptors and their desensitization kinetics in visual information processing are discussed.", 
    "35": "The role of the dorsal striatum in mediating the sedation produced by a moderate (0.75 g/kg) and an intoxicating (1.25 g/kg) EtOH dose was investigated in the open field by determining the capacity of direct intrastriatal injections of RY 008, a partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor, to antagonize EtOH's effects. SR 95531, the competitive high-affinity GABAA antagonist was used as a reference compound. Intrastriatal RY 008 (50, 500 ng) and SR 95531 (50 ng) antagonized the sedation produced by the 0.75 g/kg EtOH dose. However, RY 008 did not alter the sedation produced by the 1.25 g/kg dose. RY 008 alone was without effect. RY 008 also failed to negatively modulate GABAergic function at alpha1beta2gamma2 or alpha6beta2gamma2 receptor subtypes expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Intrastriatal modulation of the moderate EtOH dose was site specific: no antagonism by RY 008 after intraaccumbens infusions was observed. The results suggest that central GABAA-BDZ receptors in the dorsal striatum play an important role in mediating the sedation produced by a moderate EtOH dose in the open field.", 
    "36": "Benzodiazepines and opioids are co-administered recreationally as well as clinically; in the current study, the ventilatory-depressant and discriminative stimulus effects of several benzodiazepines and opioids were examined alone and in combination in order to evaluate any interaction between agonists from these pharmacological classes. The benzodiazepines alprazolam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, midazolam and triazolam and the opioids morphine and fentanyl decreased ventilation (V(E)) in monkeys breathing either air or 5% CO2 in air, although decreases in ventilation produced by opioids were greater in magnitude than decreases produced by benzodiazepines. Flumazenil antagonized the ventilatory-depressant effects of flunitrazepam and triazolam and not those of fentanyl; naltrexone antagonized the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl and not those of flunitrazepam or triazolam. Interactions between the ventilatory-depressant effects of agonists from the two classes were less than additive. In monkeys receiving 3.2 mg/kg per day of morphine and discriminating 0.01 mg/kg naltrexone, neither flunitrazepam nor triazolam substituted for naltrexone; in morphine-deprived monkeys, morphine, and not flunitrazepam or triazolam, reversed naltrexone-lever responding. Moreover, benzodiazepines did not modify the discriminative stimulus effects of naltrexone in morphine-treated monkeys or of morphine in morphine-deprived monkeys. In contrast to studies showing synergism between benzodiazepines and opioids, the current study suggests that, under some conditions, combinations of these drugs can be administered without enhancing the ventilatory-depressant effects of either class of drugs or the discriminative stimulus effects of opioids.", 
    "37": "There has recently been a marked trend to increasing dose intensity in cancer chemotherapy, with or without peripheral blood stem-cell support, which has been associated with a higher frequency of nausea and vomiting. Antiemetic treatment in this setting has not been extensively analysed. From October 1995 to January 1997, prevention of emesis with granisetron 3 mg/12 h i.v., dexamethasone 12 mg/24 h i.v., haloperidol 0.5 mg/12 h p.o., and loracepam I mg/24 h p.o. was instituted in 30 breast cancer patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy (a 4-day intravenous continuous infusion of cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2 per day, thio-TEPA 125 mg/m2 per day and carboplatin 200 mg/m2 per day).A total of 30% of the patients (9/30) obtained complete or major protection on the 4 days of chemotherapy treatment (96.7% (29/30) on day 1, 86.7% (26/30) on day 2, 70% (21/30) on day 3, and 50% (15/30) on day 4). On the days following chemotherapy, 46.7% (14/30) presented fewer than two emetic episodes on day 5, 70% (21/30) on day 6, 83.4% (25/30) on day 7 and, 93.3% (28/30) on day 8. This energic antiemetic combination treatment has hardly any effect in the prevention of emesis, providing complete or major protection of 30% for the 4 days of chemotherapy treatment. Further investigation aimed at improving antiemetic treatment results is necessary.",

We reported the clinical case of a woman, 52-year-old, diabetic, referred to the emergency room in a confusional state. Initial electroencephalogram showed continuous typical, bilateral, symmetric and synchronous spike-and-wave discharges. Clinical and electroencephalogram normalization occurred immediately following intravenous injection of benzodiazepine. Computerized axial tomography was normal. The recognition of this entity is essential because of its similarity to psychiatric disturbance and its prompt response to proper treatment.", 
    "40": "Fifty children, 24 female and 26 male, with ages varying from 6 to 72 months (mean = 23.7 m.) that experienced at least one febrile seizure (FS) entered a prospective study of intermittent therapy with clobazam. Cases with severe neurological abnormalities, progressive neurological disease, afebrile seizures, symptomatic seizures of other nature, or seizures during a central nervous system infection were excluded. Seizures were of the simple type in 25 patients, complex in 20 and unclassified in 5. The mean follow-up period was 7.9 months (range = 1 to 23 m.), and the age at the first seizure varied from 5 to 42 months (mean = 16.8 m.). Clobazam was administered orally during the febrile episode according to the child's weight: up to 5 kg, 5 mg/day; from 5 to 10 kg, 10 mg/day; from 11 to 15 kg, 15 mg/day, and over 15 kg, 20 mg/day. There were 219 febrile episodes, with temperature above 37.8 degrees C, in 40 children during the study period. Twelve children never received clobazam and 28 received the drug at least once. Drug efficacy was measured by comparing FS recurrence in the febrile episodes that were treated with clobazam with those in which only antipyretic measures were taken. Ten children (20%) experienced a FS during the study period. Of the 171 febrile episodes treated with clobazam there were only 3 recurrences (1.7%), while of the 48 episodes treated only with antipyretic measures there were 11 recurrences (22.9%), a difference highly significant (p < 0.0001). Adverse effects occurred in 10/28 patients (35.7%), consisting mainly in vomiting, somnolence and hyperactivity. Only one patient had recurrent vomiting which lead to drug interruption. These effects did not necessarily occurred in every instance the drug was administered, being present in one febrile episode and not in the others. We conclude that clonazepam is safe and efficacious in preventing FS recurrence. It may be an alternative to diazepam in the intermittent treatment of FS recurrence.", 
    "41": "Regional brain perfusion in patients during alcohol-withdrawal has been relatively less studied with brain SPECT technique. In this study, the hypothesis that possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) alterations due to alcohol withdrawal might be transitory in a homogenous group of alcoholic patients in terms of their physical-nutritional and cognitive functional conditions was investigated.", 
    "42": "Fifteen right-handed male inpatients with alcohol-withdrawal, diagnosed according to DSM-IIIR criteria, and 6 male physically-mentally healthy control subjects were included in the study. The first Technetium 99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (Tc-99m-HMPAO) brain SPECT investigation was performed on the day of admission in nonmedicated conditions and the second one was performed after all the withdrawal symptoms had subsided in the patients.

Furthermore, the frontal hypoperfusion may be transitory with recovery from alcohol-withdrawal whereas temporal hypoperfusion may continue after recovery probably depending on the previously administered high-dose benzodiazepines.", 
    "45": "The effects of target-controlled anesthesia with propofol and sufentanil on the hemodynamic response to Mayfield head holder (MH) application were evaluated in 18 ASA I and II patients undergoing scheduled intracranial surgery. Premedication consisted of hydroxyzine, alprazolam and atropine given orally 1 h before surgery. Anesthesia was provided with propofol and sufentanil using a target-controlled infusion device; constant calculated plasma concentrations of 4 micrograms ml-1 propofol and 0.5 ng ml-1 sufentanil were maintained throughout the study. Muscle relaxation was obtained with atracurium and ventilation was controlled with air/oxygen. The MH was fixed 45 +/- 12 min (mean +/- SD) after induction of anesthesia. Heart rate and systolic, diastolic, and mean non invasive arterial pressure were monitored and recorded 5 min before induction of anesthesia (control), 1 min before MH application (MH-1), at MH application, and 1 and 2 min after MH application. Systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate increased significantly during and after MH application when compared with MH-1 values, but remained constantly lower than control. Hemodynamic parameters measured 1 min before MH application were significantly lower than control. The results of the study indicate that target-controlled anesthesia maintained with constant calculated plasma concentrations of 4 micrograms ml-1 propofol and 0.5 ng ml-1 sufentanil prevents the increase in arterial pressure and heart rate beyond control values following MH application but may induce some degree of arterial hypotension in the absence of nociceptive stimulation.", 
    "46": "We previously showed that the extract of Japanese angelica root (JAR-E) reversed the decrease in pentobarbital (PB) sleep induced by isolation stress and yohimbine and methoxamine, stimulants of central noradrenergic systems, in mice. Here, we tested the effects of several fractions from JAR-E and ligustilide and butylidenephthalide, phthalide components of JAR-E, on PB sleep in isolated mice to elucidate the mechanism of the action of JAR-E. Methanol-soluble (Met-S) and -insoluble (Met-IS) fractions were obtained from JAR-E. Methylenechloride-soluble (MC-S) and -insoluble fractions (MC-IS) were prepared from Met-S. MC-S (11.4-76 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the isolation stress-induced decrease in PB sleep, but neither Met-IS (0.8-2.4 g/kg, p.o.) nor MC-IS (0.7-2 g/kg, p.o.) had the same effect. The i.p. administration of MC-S exhibited a similar activity to that observed after the p.o. administration of the same fraction. Ligustilide (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) and butylidenephthalide (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed PB sleep decrease in isolated mice. Both components (20 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the suppressive effects of yohimbine (30 nmol, i.c.v.), methoxamine (200 nmol, i.c.v.) and a benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG7142 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on PB sleep in group-housed mice. These results suggest the contribution of ligustilide and butylidenephthalide to the effect of JAR-E on PB sleep in isolated mice, and implicate central noradrenergic and/or GABA(A) systems in the effects of these components.",

    "49": "From the experiments using ten expressed human CYPs, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were shown to be capable of catalyzing zonisamide reduction. However, an intrinsic clearance, Vmax/kM, of CYP3A4 was much higher than those of CYP2C19 and CYP3A5. From the point of view of enzyme amount in human liver CYPs isoform and their intrinsic clearance, it was suggested that CYP3A4 is mainly responsible for zonisamide metabolism in human CYPs. Zonisamide metabolism in human liver microsomes was markedly inhibited by cyclosporin A, dihydroergotamine, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole and triazolam. We estimated the possibility and degree of change of zonisamide clearance in vivo in clinical dose range from in vitro inhibition constant of other drugs against zonisamide metabolism (Ki) and unbound inhibitor concentration in blood (Iu) in clinical usage. Clearance of zonisamide was maximally estimated to decrease by 31%, 23% and 17% of the clearance without inhibitors i.e. ketoconazole, cyclospolin A and miconazole, respectively. Fluconazole and carbamazepine are estimated to decrease by 5-6% of the clearance of zonisamide. On the other hand, there may be lack of interaction of zonisamide metabolism by dihydroergotamine, itraconazole and triazolam in clinical dose range.", 
    "50": "We demonstrated that: (1) zonisamide is metabolized by recombinant CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP3A5, (2) the metabolism is inhibited to a variable extent by known CYP3A4/5 substrates and/or inhibitors in human liver microsomes, and (3) in vitro-in vivo predictive calculations suggest that several compounds demonstrating CYP3A4-affinity might cause in vivo drug-drug interactions with zonisamide.",

Substantial differences in patterns of drug use between Estonia and the two Nordic countries were observed. The amount of prescription-only medicines used in Estonia was approximately 25% of that used in Finland and Sweden. The amount of over-the-counter drugs used was 61% of that used in Finland and 58% of that used in Sweden. In the drug use patterns in Estonia, some common trends can be noted: (1) persistent traditions, such as the low use of diuretics, beta-blockers, antithrombotics and inhalant anti-asthmatic drugs; (2) changes in prescription preferences--central anti-adrenergic drugs, pyrazolones, aminoglycosides and barbiturates are being replaced by calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, propionic acid derivatives, cephalosporins and benzodiazepines, respectively; (3) rapidly increasing use of drugs not prescribed in the 1980s, such as hormonal contraceptives, opioids and antiulcer drugs, which strongly improves the quality of pharmacotherapy in Estonia.",

The changes are more rapid in Estonia than in Finland and Sweden, but, because of a short observation period, the use of newer drugs not yet prevailing. The international differences in drug utilization observed in this study may possibly be related mainly to the prescription preferences (e.g. therapeutic traditions) and less dependent on the respective health care systems (e.g. reimbursement schemes) and economic state of the country.",

    "67": "Covalent binding of a reactive metabolite of clozapine to neutrophils or their precursors is thought to play a role in the development of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Immunoblotting studies with an anti-clozapine antiserum detected covalent binding of clozapine to human neutrophils in vitro when HOCl was used to generate clozapine reactive metabolite (major clozapine adducts of 31, 49, 58, 78, 86, 126, 160, and 204 kDa). In addition, incubating neutrophils with clozapine and H2O2 (major clozapine adducts of 49 and 58 kDa) or clozapine, H2O2, and human myeloperoxidase (major clozapine adducts of 31, 49, 58, and 126 kDa) also resulted in covalent binding of clozapine to the neutrophils. The covalent binding of clozapine to neutrophils was inhibited by extracellular glutathione when HOCl, but not H2O2 was used to generate reactive metabolite. We found that the antiserum against clozapine also recognized olanzapine, an antipsychotic drug that forms a similar reactive metabolite to clozapine but has not been associated with induction of agranulocytosis. Repeating the in vitro experiments with olanzapine revealed that the major olanzapine-modified polypeptides had molecular masses of 96, 130-170, and 218 kDa. Only relatively low levels of 31, 49, and 58 kDa adducts were observed. Clozapine-modified polypeptides also were detected in neutrophils from patients being treated with clozapine. A major 58-kDa clozapine-modified polypeptide was detected in all patients tested. In contrast, no drug-modified polypeptides were detected in neutrophils from patients taking olanzapine. The differences in covalent binding exhibited by the two compounds and, in particular, the lack of olanzapine binding to human neutrophils in vivo may help to explain the difference in toxicity of these two drugs.", 
    "68": "Olanzapine was shown to be oxidized to a reactive intermediate by HOCl, which is the major oxidant produced by activated neutrophils. A mass spectrum obtained using a flow system in which the reactants were fed into a mixing chamber and the products flowed directly into a mass spectrometer revealed a reactive intermediate at m/z 311. This is 2 mass units less than the protonated molecular ion of parent olanzapine and suggests that the reactive intermediate is a nitrenium ion. The reactive intermediate could be trapped with glutathione or N-acetylcysteine to produce two conjugates. These data are analogous to results we reported previously with the structurally related atypical antipsychotic agent clozapine. However, the clozapine and olanzapine reactive metabolites showed differences in their ability to cause toxicity to human neutrophils. Toxicity to neutrophils was observed only at high concentrations of clozapine (>50 microM) when HOCl was used to generate reactive metabolite. In contrast, concentration-dependent toxicity (p < 0.05) was observed when neutrophils were incubated with clozapine (0-20 microM) and H2O2 to generate clozapine reactive metabolite. No toxicity was observed with clozapine alone (at concentrations of > 50 microM). Similar results were observed in monocytes and HL-60 cells. Olanzapine reactive metabolite only seemed to cause slight toxicity at the highest concentrations tested (20 microM), even when the reactive metabolite was generated using H2O2. Neutrophils from two patients with a history of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis seemed to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of the clozapine reactive metabolite; however, the numbers are too small to draw any definite conclusions.", 
    "69": "The present study investigated the effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists dizocilpine (MK-801) and ifenprodil on the appearance of diazepam withdrawal signs caused by discontinuation of long-term diazepam treatment using a drug-admixed food (DAF) method in Fischer 344 rats. The total withdrawal score was significantly decreased by after-withdrawal treatment with dizocilpine or ifenprodil. Dizocilpine, in particular, markedly suppressed the motor withdrawal signs and body weight loss, while ifenprodil suppressed the motor and emotional withdrawal signs. Furthermore, the decrease in the food intake during withdrawal (anorexia) was significantly reduced by dizocilpine, but not by ifenprodil. These behavioral results indicated that the activation of NMDA receptors during withdrawal may play an important role in the appearance of withdrawal signs (in particular motor withdrawal signs) caused by discontinuation of chronic diazepam treatment, and that inhibitory agents for NMDA receptors may be effective in alleviation of the appearance of benzodiazepine withdrawal signs.", 
    "70": "1. We investigated the role of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors and their regulation in affecting respiratory-related neurones in a neonatal rat medullary slice that spontaneously generates respiratory-related rhythm and motor output in the hypoglossal (XII) nerve. 2. Bath application of the AMPA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine (GYKI) completely blocked XII nerve activity, as well as respiratory-related synaptic drives in neurones within the preB\u00f6tzinger Complex (preBotC), site of rhythm generation in the slice. 3. Local application of GYKI to the preB\u00f6tC blocked respiratory rhythm. Local application of AMPA to the preB\u00f6tC increased rhythm frequency and depolarized respiratory-related neurones. 4. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), GYKI completely blocked the inward current induced by local application of AMPA, but not that induced by kainate. 5. Local application of okadaic acid, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of phosphatase 1 and 2A, to the preBotC increased the frequency of respiratory motor discharge. 6. Intracellular application of microcystin, a membrane-impermeable inhibitor of phosphatase 1 and 2A, enhanced endogenous inspiratory drive and exogenous AMPA-induced current (in the presence of TTX) in preBotC inspiratory neurones. Both the enhanced inspiratory drive and the increased AMPA-induced current were completely blocked by GYKI. 7. We suggest that AMPA receptor activation and AMPA receptor modulation by phosphorylation are crucial for the rhythm generation within the preB\u00f6tC.", 
    "71": "1. We have examined the mechanisms by which cultured central neurones from embryonic rat brain buffer intracellular Ca2+ loads following kainate receptor activation using fluorescent indicators of [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i. 2. Stimulation of cultured forebrain neurones with 100 microM kainate produced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i that displayed a variable rate of recovery. Kainate also increased [Na+]i with a response that was slightly slower in onset and markedly slower in recovery. 3. The recovery of [Ca2+]i to baseline was not very sensitive to the [Na+]i. The magnitude of the increase in [Na+]i in response to kainate did not correlate well with the [Ca2+]i recovery time, and experimental manipulations that altered [Na+]i did not have a large impact on the rate of recovery of [Ca2+]i. 4. The recovery of [Ca2+]i to baseline was accelerated by the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibitor CGP-37157, suggesting that the recovery rate is influenced by release of Ca2+ from a mitochondrial pool and also that variation in the recovery rate is related to the extent of mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. Kainate did not alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. 5. These studies reveal that mitochondria have a central role in buffering neuronal [Ca2+]i changes mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, and that the variation in recovery times following kainate receptor activation reflects a variable degree of mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. However, unlike NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ loads, kainate receptor activation has minimal effects on mitochondrial function.", 
    "72": "Grapefruit juice has been reported to markedly improve the bioavailability of triazolam, midazolam, terfenadine, cyclosporine and several dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers including felodipine, nifedipine, nitrendipine and nisoldipine. Because these drugs are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isozyme (CYP) 3A4, the inhibitory effect of grapefruit juice is thought to results from inhibition of CYP3A4. In this study, our aim was to investigate the effects of grapefruit juice on plasma concentrations of diazepam. Eight healthy male and female subjects participated in this study. Oral (5 mg) diazepam was administered with either 250 ml water and grapefruit juice. Blood samples were collected for a 24 h period, and whole blood concentrations of diazepam were measured enzyme immunoassay. The mean AUC(0-24) of diazepam was increased 3.2-fold (P < 0.001) and Cmax was increased 1.5-fold (P < 0.05) by the grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice postponed the tmax of diazepam from 1.50 h to 2.06 h (P < 0.01).", 
    "73": "A multicolumn approach was developed to address the limited achiral selectivity of chiral stationary phases. Groups of structurally related compounds, including beta-blockers and 1,4-benzodiazepines, were separated using coupled achiral/chiral stationary phases under subcritical fluid conditions. The achiral selectivity of amino and cyano stationary phases was used to modify the resolution of compounds on a Chiralcel OD chiral stationary phase by combining the achiral and chiral columns in series. In the case of the benzodiazepines, separation of achiral compounds was performed concurrently with the enantioseparation of chiral molecules. The separation of components of a multidrug cough and cold medication was also demonstrated on a cyano column coupled with a Chiralpak AD chiral stationary phase. The use of modified carbon dioxide eluents eliminated the mobile phase incompatibility problems associated with column coupling in liquid chromatography and incorporated the high efficiency of sub- and supercritical fluid chromatography.",

Inhibition of rat brain and human placenta MAO-A by both compounds was much more potent (with IC50 range 0.3-0.005 microM) than that of GABAA receptors. Pirlindole was inactive as a GABA antagonist. Dehydro-pirlindole exhibited selective blockade of GABA-A receptors with EC50 12 microM. Effects of both compounds on MAO-A activity were partially reversible. Data obtained suggest that in contrast to pirlindole dehydro-pirlindole may act not only as a MAO-A inhibitor but also as a potent GABAA receptor blocker.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the sedative-hypnotic effects of amitriptyline in treating opiate-withdrawal insomnia. A total of 27 patients with opiate withdrawal were given either amitriptyline or lorazepam in a randomized double-blind trial. Sleep was assessed by means of the Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire and three insomnia items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The scores of two sleep measures showed that all aspects of sleep, except for ease of awakening from sleep, in the two treatment groups were not significantly different. In conclusion, apart from the hangover effect, amitriptyline is as effective as lorazepam in the treatment of opiate-withdrawal insomnia.", 
    "81": "Recent advances in neural mechanisms of taste are reviewed with special reference to neuroactive substances. In the first section, taste transduction mechanisms of basic tastes are explained in two groups, whether taste stimuli directly activate ion channels in the taste cell membrane or they bind to cell surface receptors coupled to intracellular signaling pathways. In the second section, putative transmitters and modulators from taste cells to afferent nerves are summarized. The candidates include acetylcholine, catecholamines, serotonin, amino acids and peptides. Studies favor serotonin as a possible neuromodulator in the taste bud. In the third section, the role of neuroactive substances in the central gustatory pathways is introduced. Excitatory and inhibitory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and GABA) and peptides (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) are proved to play roles in transmission of taste information in both the brainstem relay and cortical gustatory area. In the fourth section, conditioned taste aversion is introduced as a model to study gustatory learning and memory. Pharmacobehavioral studies to examine the effects of glutamate receptor antagonists and protein kinase C inhibitors on the formation of conditioned taste aversion show that both glutamate and protein kinase C in the amygdala and cortical gustatory area play essential roles in taste aversion learning. Recent molecular and genetic approaches to disclose biological mechanisms of gustatory learning are also introduced. In the last section, behavioral and pharmacological approaches to elucidate palatability, taste pleasure, are described. Dopamine, benzodiazepine derivatives and opioid substances may play some roles in evaluation of palatability and motivation to ingest palatable edibles.", 
    "82": "Fractionation of bovine corpus luteum (CL) homogenates on continuous sucrose density gradients with and without preincubation with 3H-progesterone demonstrated high levels of tracer binding and high content of endogenous progesterone associated with particulate membrane fractions. Analysis of gradient fractions for a range of luteal plasma membrane and intracellular organelle marker enzyme activities indicated that endogenous progesterone content and 3H-progesterone-binding activity were associated with fractions enriched in luteal plasma membrane markers. This was confirmed by pretreatment of homogenates with the saponin, digitonin, prior to fractionation. Digitonin perturbed the buoyant density of luteal surface membrane markers and 3H-progesterone binding to a similar extent, but did not perturb the buoyant densities of other intracellular markers to the same degree. Interestingly, digitonin pretreatment also increased the proportion of progesterone tracer that entered the gradients. We consistently failed to demonstrate significant binding of 3H-progesterone to membrane fractions incubated with progesterone tracer in vitro. However, when digitonin was included in the in vitro binding assay, we observed a dramatic, dose-dependent stimulation of 3H-progesterone binding by digitonin. Other radiolabeled steroids tested (3H-cortisol, 3H-testosterone) bound poorly in the presence or absence of digitonin. 3H-Progesterone binding in the presence of optimal digitonin concentrations increased linearly with increasing luteal membrane concentration; was dependent on the pH, duration, and temperature of incubation; and low levels of progesterone (68 nM) competed for tracer binding. A range of other steroids tested (androgens, estrogens, corticosteroids, steroid precursors) competed at higher concentrations (10- to 100-fold) or did not compete at all for 3H-progesterone binding. There was no correlation between the hydrophobicity of various steroids and their ability to compete for binding. Moreover, a number of agonists and antagonists specific for the genomic progesterone receptor, agonists of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, and inhibitors of a range of steroidogenic enzymes did not compete for 3H-progesterone binding. Western blots confirmed that detergent-solubilized progesterone-binding sites could be resolved from cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Moreover, extraction of bound steroid from the binding site and HPLC demonstrated identity to progesterone, suggesting that no metabolism of the progesterone tracer had occurred during incubation. Progesterone binding to membranes of large luteal cells was higher compared with binding to small luteal cells, and levels were similar in membranes prepared from CL at all stages of the luteal phase. We suggest that bovine luteal progesterone-binding sites may play a role either in sequestration of newly synthesized progesterone or in the mediation of autocrine and/or paracrine actions of progesterone in the CL.",

Clear non-linear elimination of S-8510 was observed after single oral administration of S-8510 in all animals tested (F344 rat, 1-50 mg/kg; SD rat and B6C3F1 mouse, 1-150 mg/kg). 3. Exposure of S-8510 after single oral administration was in the order F344 rat > B6C3F1 mouse > SD rat. 4. Multiple oral administration to F344 rat and B6C3F1 mouse decreased the exposure to S-8510. 5.

    "88": "The involvement of endogenous benzodiazepine octadecaneuropeptide in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA expression has been studied using in situ hybridization technique. Intracerebroventricular injection of octadecaneuropeptide (4 microg/kg) induced a 26% decrease in the corticotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Concomitant injection of octadecaneuropeptide and i.p. injection of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (4 mg/kg) potentiated the corticotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA decrease ( - 34%). The depressing effect of octadecaneuropeptide on corticotropin-releasing hormone gene expression was totally reversed by pretreatment of the animals with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin (5 mg/kg; i.p.) or by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (4 mg/kg; i.p.). To determine the reciprocal involvement of adrenal and sexual steroids in this regulation, animals are adrenalectomized and/or castrated. Adrenalectomy reversed the effect induced by octadecaneuropeptide, which increased corticotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA expression (+21%), while castration did not modify the negative influence of octadecaneuropeptide. When rats were adrenalectomized and castrated, the adrenalectomy influence was predominant, since octadecaneuropeptide increased significantly the hybridization signal (+18%). The involvement of neurosteroids, especially reduced metabolites of progesterone was also investigated. The concomitant injection of octadecaneuropeptide and subcutaneous injection of the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor MK-906 (14 mg/kg) to adrenalectomized and castrated rats, reduced significantly by 60% the increase of corticotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA expression induced by octadecaneuropeptide. These results indicate that in vivo the endogenous benzodiazepine octadecaneuropeptide, via an activation of the benzodiazepine sites of the GABA(A) receptor, negatively modulates corticotropin-releasing hormone neuronal activity and that this modulation can be negatively or positively influenced by central and peripheral steroids.", 
    "89": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of midazolam on circulation, respiration, sedation, and liver function of the neonates. The study subjects are 27 neonates (body weight 2.1 to 3.8 kg, gestational age at birth 34 to 41 weeks) who underwent surgery in neonatal period. Of 27, 13 patients received lidocaine (1.5 mg.kg-1) immediately before tracheal intubation (group L), and 14 had midazolam (0.1 mg.kg-1) with lidocaine (group ML). We compared the effects of midazolam in the presence of lidocaine on the following parameters: (1) the incidence of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 50 mmHg) and bradycardia (heart rate < 100 beats.min-1), (2) the incidence of apnea and desaturation of oxygen (< 80%), (3) the degree of sedation, and (4) the serum levels of bilirubin and unbound bilirubin after surgery. In group L, there were hypotension (1/13) and desaturation (1/13). In group ML, there were desaturation (1/14) and post-operative apnea (1/14). None in both groups developed bradycardia or intracranial hemorrhage. A single-dose of lidocaine induced sedation only in 4 neonates, while combination of midazolam and lidocaine in 11. None had elevation of either total or unbound bilirubin after surgery. In conclusion, the titrated dose of midazolam with lidocaine is useful for anesthetic induction of neonates, although cares should be taken on its adverse effects such as hypotension, desaturation, and post-operative apnea.", 
    "90": "Experiments were conducted on C57B1 mice to study the role of the social status on the reproduction of a conditioned reaction of passive avoidance and the effect of medazepam on the processes of reproduction. Aggressive and submissive animals were selected according to the test for agonistic confrontations. No effect of the animals' social status on the formation of a conditioned habit was revealed, but a significant increase in the level of defecation was recorded in the aggressive mice. Medazepam administration before the test reduced the reproduction of the conditioned reaction only in the control mice. An amnestic effect blocked reproduction in control and submissive mice but did not change it in the aggressors. Medazepam restored the amnestic memory trace only in submissive individuals. In aggressive mice it reduced the emotional response but did not change reproduction. The data obtained suggest that variations of the social status determine both the behavioral responsiveness to training and the changes in reproduction in response to medazepam.",

    "92": "The development of non-peptide agonists for peptide hormone receptors would markedly expand the treatment options for a large number of diseases. However, difficulty in identifying non-peptide molecules which possess intrinsic activity has been a major obstacle in achieving this goal. At present, most of the known non-peptide ligands for peptide hormone receptors appear in standard functional assays to be antagonists. Here, we report that a constitutively active mutant of the human cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor, Leu325 --> Glu, offers the potential to detect even trace agonist activity of ligands which, at the wild type receptor isoform, appear to lack efficacy. The enhanced functional sensitivity of the mutant receptor enabled us to detect intrinsic activity of L-365,260, an established non-peptide antagonist for the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor. Extending from this observation, we were able to demonstrate that minor structural modifications could convert L-365, 260 into either: (i) an agonist or (ii) an inverse agonist (attenuates ligand-independent signaling). The ability to confer functional activity to small non-peptide ligands suggests that the properties of endogenous peptide hormones can be mimicked, and even extended, by considerably less complex molecules.",

Selective N-methylation of a racemic precursor with [11C]iodomethane and subsequent optical resolution of the racemate with HPLC afforded optically pure [11C]L-365,260 and [11C]L-365,346, which are selective for CCK-B (central-type) receptors and CCK-A (peripheral-type) receptors, respectively. Biodistribution studies in mice showed very low brain uptakes (<0.8% dose/gram) of the radioactivities after intravenous injections of these compounds, although that of brain CCK-B receptor-selective [11C]L-365,260 was 2-fold that of [11C]L-365,346. In peripheral organs, uptake of the radioactivity in the pancreas was the highest among the organs tested after the injection of [11C]L-365,346 and was 3-fold that of [11C]L-365,260. It was also observed that high uptake of [11C]L-365,346 in rat pancreas was significantly inhibited by a simultaneous injection with a large dose of L-365,346 (3 mg/kg). These preliminary results suggest that the nonpeptide CCK antagonist [11C]L-365,346 may be useful for probing pancreatic CCK-A receptors by PET. Owing to the very low brain permeability, however, [11C]L-365,260 may have no potential as a PET tracer for probing brain CCK-B receptors.", 
    "95": "A naturally occurring brain lipid, cis-9,10-octadeceamide--oleamide (OA), is found in increased concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived cats, which suggests that it may be an endogenous sleep-inducing substance. We studied the effects of this fatty-acid derivative on the function of cloned gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with cRNA synthesized in vitro to express simple GABA(A) receptors (alpha1beta1, alpha3beta1, alpha5beta1, and alpha1beta2 subunit combinations) and receptors in which the GABA-induced chloride currents were potentiated in the presence of benzodiazepines (alpha1beta1gamma2s and alpha1beta2gamma2s subunit combinations). OA only produced significant potentiation of the peak Cl- current when applied with GABA to benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors. The peak currents of the simple GABA(A) receptors in the presence of OA were either unaffected or slightly inhibited by OA, but the overall mean currents were not significantly altered. Oleic acid was also capable of potentiating benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptor function. The function of other ligand-gated ion channels, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR1 + NR2A or 2C) and the 5-HT3 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes, were unaffected by OA. Sprague-Dawley rats receiving intraperitoneal injections of oleamide (10, 20, or 100 mg/kg) showed no change in the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) of desflurane required to abolish movement in response to noxious (tail clamp) stimulation (control MAC 6.48% +/- 1.28% atm; 100 mg/kg OA MAC 7.05% +/- 0.42% atm). These results reinforce the view that oleyl compounds may be natural modulators of inhibitory ion channel function, but that these effects contribute little to the central nervous system depression produced by volatile anesthetics as measured by MAC.",

Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic and activating factor that mediates neutrophil adhesion and margination and is essential for host defense. We investigated the effect of anesthetics on isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocyte production of IL-8. Healthy human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated using a single-step density gradient and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in the presence of varying concentrations of propofol or midazolam for up to 20 h. IL-8 was measured in both culture supernatants and cell lysates using enzyme immunoassay, and IL-8 mRNA in cells was measured using Northern blotting and phosphorimaging. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance or the Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Lipopolysaccharide increased extracellular accumulation of interleukin-8, which was suppressed by both propofol (P = 0.025) and midazolam (P = 0.028). However, intracellular IL-8 increased with exposure to lipopolysaccharide (P = 0.028) and remained increased with both anesthetics. Northern blot analysis also revealed increased IL-8 mRNA levels in the presence of both midazolam and propofol, which was confirmed by molecular imaging. These data strongly suggest that the anesthetics modulate transport or secretion of IL-8 protein from the cell. Suppression of IL-8 by anesthetics and sedatives may predispose postoperative and intensive care patients to infection.",

Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported after the administration of propofol. These side effects are potentially deleterious in severe trauma patients, particularly in patients with head trauma. To assess the safety and efficacy of Mz and Pf, alone or in combination, in the prolonged sedation of severe trauma patients, we designed a prospective, controlled, randomized, study. One hundred consecutively admitted trauma patients requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation for more than 48 h were studied. Patients were sedated according to three different protocols based on the continuous i.v. administration of Mz alone, Pf alone, and Mz in combination with Pf. All patients received morphine chloride. Safety and efficacy were assessed during the sedation and wake-up periods according to clinical and laboratory variables. Cerebral hemodynamics were also studied in patients with head trauma. Patients were sedated for 6.3 +/- 4.0 days (mean +/- SD). All three sedation regimens were equally efficacious in achieving the desired sedation goal. The incidence of adverse events during the sedation period was also similar. In head trauma patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, we did not find differences in ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, or jugular venous oxygen saturation among the three groups. The serum triglyceride concentration was significantly higher in the Pf group. Wake-up time was significantly shorter in the Pf group. We conclude that both Mz and Pf are safe and efficacious in the sedation of severe trauma patients. The use of Pf in these patients is associated with a high incidence of hypertriglyceridemia and a shorter wake-up time.",

Bovine brain membranes were photoaffinity labelled with [3H]Ro15-4513 and after solubilization and denaturation, proteins were specifically cleaved at either cysteine or tryptophan residues. Peptides were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cleavage at cysteine residues generated a labelled peptide of Mr 6.5K, while cleavage at tryptophan residues generated a labelled peptide with an Mr of 5K. Cleavage products of this size indicate that the site of [3H]Ro15-4513 incorporation occurs between the end of the first transmembrane domain and the first four amino acids of the third transmembrane domain (residues 247-289). This region of the GABAA receptor has not previously been implicated in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site and may be part of a unique recognition domain for inverse agonists.",

    "105": "Data from 254 patients undergoing infradiaphragmatic arteriography at three institutions were evaluated. The effect of age, sex, procedure time, attending physician, and institution on drug use was assessed by analysis of variance and covariance with repeated measures. In a subset of 34 patients, pain and anxiety scores before and after medication were correlated with drug scores.", 
    "106": "Institution identity and procedure time significantly affected the amount of medication used (both, P = .000). Patient's age and sex, and identity of the physician had no significant effects. While drug use was relatively constant in each institution among different staff physicians, the institutional differences prevailed when the same physicians performed procedures at different institutions. Drug deliveries did not correlate with anxiety and pain scores before or after medication.", 
    "107": "Habits and philosophies of particular institutions, rather than physician guidance or patients' needs, tend to govern the use of intravenous sedatives and analgesics. There is a need for a more patient-oriented standardization of intravenous conscious sedation and analgesia.", 
    "108": "Although recognized for their sedative properties, benzodiazepines are also known to impair sustained and selective attention. Flumazenil at low doses may act to antagonize benzodiazepine-induced effects. This study examined whether low doses of flumazenil would improve event-related brain potential (ERP) indicators of selective attention and induce feelings of activation and anxiety in healthy men. Data from 11 men (24-30 years) who received intravenous flumazenil (0.2 mg, plus 0.3 mg 30 minutes later) and placebo were analyzed according to a double-blind crossover design. ERPs were recorded while subjects performed an auditory selective attention task. Mismatch negativity (MMN), processing negativity (PN), and the P3 component were extracted from the ERP as markers of preattentive mismatch processing, selective attention, and stimulus processing within working memory, respectively. Counting accuracy and performance on a letter cancellation test were used as behavioral indicators of attention. Mood was assessed by an adjective checklist and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Flumazenil significantly increased PN over frontocortical areas, indicating improved selective attention (p < 0.05). Increases in the P3 amplitude and MMN after drug treatment remained nonsignificant. Subjects felt more activated and extraverted after flumazenil treatment than after placebo (p < 0.05). Anxiety was not increased. The findings of this study confirm the concept that flumazenil administered at a low dose in humans exerts effects opposite to those of benzodiazepines.", 
    "109": "Benzodiazepine withdrawal delirium is thought to be uncommon. Only two clear reports of alprazolam withdrawal appear in the literature, but the use of this drug is expected to increase because of its recent approval for the treatment of panic disorder. We report on a patient with severe alprazolam withdrawal delirium that developed immediately after an accidental reduction of the dose. This case demonstrates importance of clinician awareness of the previous use of alprazolam in individual patients, especially in hospital settings where free patient use of drugs is prohibited.", 
    "110": "Fifty-two outpatients suffering from anxiety of nonpsychotic origin were included in an observational study of a kava-kava preparation. Drug efficacy was evident on measures of a global improvement scale, with 42 patients (80.8%) rating treatment as \"very good\" or \"good\". Adverse events were rare. These results support kava-kava extract as an effective and safe alternative to antidepressants and tranquilizers in anxiety disorder without the tolerance problems associated with benzodiazepines.", 
    "111": "To conduct a meta-analysis of the antispastic efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine, we reviewed records of the European sponsor of tizanidine trials and selected double-blind, randomized studies of moderate duration in which oral tizanidine was compared with baclofen or diazepam. Studies were required to have individual patient data; three key outcome measures (Ashworth Rating Scale for muscle tone, a measure of muscle strength, and Global Tolerability to Treatment Rating); and patients with multiple sclerosis or cerebrovascular lesions. Ten trials involving 270 patients met these criteria. Seven studies used baclofen as the positive control; three used diazepam. As measured by Total and Lower Body Ashworth scores, tizanidine and similar spasticity-reducing effects to both baclofen and diazepam. Muscle strength was affected less by tizanidine than by either comparator, and investigators judged tizanidine to have greater tolerability. Within the limits of these comparisons, tizanidine, baclofen, and diazepam were equally effective in decreasing excessive muscle tone in patients with multiple sclerosis or cerebrovascular lesions. Muscle strength improved in all three treatment groups, but improvement was greatest with tizanidine.", 
    "112": "Basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic regulation of cataplexy was investigated in narcoleptic canines. Specific cholinergic agonists and antagonists, and excitatory or inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter receptor agonists, were perfused through microdialysis probes implanted bilaterally in the BF of narcoleptic canines. Cataplexy was monitored using the food-elicited cataplexy test (FECT) and recordings of electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, and electromyogram. In narcoleptic canines, carbachol and oxotremorine (10(-5)-10(-3) M), but not McN-A-343 or nicotine (10(-4)-10(-3) M), produced a dose-dependent increase in cataplexy. In addition, N-methyl-d-aspartate (10(-4)-10(-3) M) and kainic acid (10(-5)-10(-4) M) did not have any effects, while muscimol (10(-3) M) produced a weak (P < 0.10) increase in cataplexy. In control canines, carbachol (10(-5)-10(-3) M), but not oxotremorine (10(-4)-10(-3) M), produced muscle atonia after the highest concentration in one of three animals. Carbachol (10(-3) M)-induced cataplexy in narcoleptic canines was blocked by equimolar perfusion with the muscarinic antagonists atropine, gallamine, and 4-DAMP but not pirenzepine. These findings indicate that carbachol-stimulated cataplexy in the BF of narcoleptic canines is mediated by M2, and perhaps M3, muscarinic receptors. The release of acetylcholine in the BF was also examined during FECT and non-FECT behavioral stimulation in narcoleptic and control canines. A significant increase in acetylcholine release was found in both narcoleptic and control BF during FECT stimulation. In contrast, simple motor activity and feeding, approximating that which occurs during an FECT, did not affect acetylcholine release in the BF of narcoleptic canines. These findings indicate that BF acetylcholine release is enhanced during learned emotion/reward associated behaviors in canines.", 
    "113": "We evaluated a new, qualitative immunoassay for benzodiazepines in urine using CEDIA technology on the Hitachi 747 and compared its performance to an immunoassay using EMIT II methodology on the same instrument. A total of 500 urine samples received for routine drug screen analysis were prospectively examined for benzodiazepines by both methods. Samples producing positive results by either immunoassay method were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Available medical records were reviewed for patients whose samples produced discrepant immunoassay results or that were positive in both immunoassays but negative by GC-MS. Samples that produced negative results in both immunoassays were not subjected to GC-MS analysis. Therefore, identification of an immunoassay result as a false negative only occurred when the sample produced a positive value in only one of the two immunoassays and was confirmed as positive by either GC-MS or medical record review. Following initial immunoassay screening and confirmation by GC-MS, a medical record review and reanalysis of GC-MS data was performed. After this in-depth analysis of the data, the CEDIA method produced 60 true-positives, 7 false positives and no false negatives. The EMIT II method produced 47 true positives, 1 fase positive and 13 false negatives. These differences appear to be due to the CEDIA assay being more sensitive for detection of lorazepam.", 
    "114": "The GABAA receptor is allosterically modulated by a number of anesthetics and barbiturates. We have examined the effects of propofol and pentobarbital on the binding of the receptor agonist [3H]muscimol and the benzodiazepine modulators [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro15-4513 to bovine brain membranes. Both agents potentiated the binding of [3H]muscimol (5 nM), with EC50 values of 18.7 and 276 microM, respectively. The binding of [3H]muscimol is heterogeneous, suggesting the presence of both high (Kd approximately 10 nM) and low (Kd approximately 0.1-1.0 microM) affinity sites. The major effect of both propofol and pentobarbital was to increase the affinity of the lower affinity sites without changing the total binding capacity. In contrast, the steroid anesthetic alphaxalone did not affect the affinity of these sites, suggesting that this drug has distinct effects on the GABAA receptor. Propofol and pentobarbital also increased the binding of the benzodiazepine agonist [3H]flunitrazepam and decreased the binding of the inverse agonist [3H]Ro15-4513. The results of these studies demonstrate that propofol and pentobarbital modulate the binding of ligands to the GABAA receptor in a similar manner, suggesting that these drugs may have a common mechanism of action.", 
    "115": "The mothers of infant rats show individual differences in the frequency of licking/grooming and arched-back nursing (LG-ABN) of pups that contribute to the development of individual differences in behavioral responses to stress. As adults, the offspring of mothers that exhibited high levels of LG-ABN showed substantially reduced behavioral fearfulness in response to novelty compared with the offspring of low LG-ABN mothers. In addition, the adult offspring of the high LG-ABN mothers showed significantly (i) increased central benzodiazepine receptor density in the central, lateral, and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala as well as in the locus ceruleus, (ii) increased alpha2 adrenoreceptor density in the locus ceruleus, and (iii) decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor density in the locus ceruleus. The expression of fear and anxiety is regulated by a neural circuitry that includes the activation of ascending noradrenergic projections from the locus ceruleus to the forebrain structures. Considering the importance of the amygdala, notably the anxiogenic influence of CRH projections from the amygdala to the locus ceruleus, as well as the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines, for the expression of behavioral responses to stress, these findings suggest that maternal care during infancy serves to \"program\" behavioral responses to stress in the offspring by altering the development of the neural systems that mediate fearfulness.", 
    "116": "Mice were selectively bred according to their sensitivity or their resistance to the convulsive effects of a 4-mg/kg dose of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), a benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor inverse agonist. The selection proved to be easy, with a clear separation of the two lines, convulsing with short latencies or resistant, already at the first generation of selection. Selection of a third line of animals convulsing with long latencies did not succeed. 3H-Ro 15-1788 binding analysis provided evidence for a strong decrease in Bmax in the resistant line.", 
    "117": "1. Blind patch clamp recordings were made from substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurones in the adult rat spinal cord slice to study the mechanisms of cholinergic modulation of GABAergic inhibition. 2. In the majority of SG neurones tested, carbachol (10 microM) increased the frequency (677 % of control) of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). A portion of these events appeared to result from the generation of spikes by GABAergic interneurones, since large amplitude IPSCs were eliminated by tetrodotoxin (1 microM). 3. The effect of carbachol on spontaneous IPSCs was mimicked by neostigmine, suggesting that GABAergic interneurones are under tonic regulation by cholinergic systems. 4. The frequency of GABAergic miniature IPSCs in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 microM) was also increased by carbachol without affecting amplitude distribution, indicating that acetylcholine facilitates quantal release of GABA through presynaptic mechanisms. 5. Neither the M1 receptor agonist McN-A-343 (10-300 microM) nor the M2 receptor agonist, arecaidine (10-100 microM), mimicked the effects of carbachol. All effects of carbachol and neostigmine were antagonized by atropine (1 muM), while pirenzepine (100 nM), methoctramine (1 microM) and hexahydrosiladifenidol hydrochloride, p-fluoro-analog (100 nM) had no effect. 6. Focal stimulation of deep dorsal horn, but not dorsolateral funiculus, evoked a similar increase in IPSC frequency to that evoked by carbachol and neostigmine. The stimulation-induced facilitation of GABAergic transmission lasted for 2-3 min post stimulation, and the effect was antagonized by atropine (100 nM). 7. Our observations suggest that GABAergic interneurones possess muscarinic receptors on both axon terminals and somatodendritic sites, that the activation of these receptors increases the excitability of inhibitory interneurones and enhances GABA release in SG and that the GABAergic inhibitory system is further controlled by cholinergic neurones located in the deep dorsal horn. Those effects may be responsible for the antinociceptive action produced by the intrathecal administration of muscarinic agonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.", 
    "118": "A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using only 0.1 ml of serum or homogenate from brain areas has been developed for the determination of fluoxetine (FLU) and its metabolite, norfluoxetine (N-FLU), with ultraviolet detection at 227 nm. The small volume of sample required in this method allows studies in small animals, such as mouse. The method provides recoveries of up to 90% for both compounds. Acceptable coefficients of variation were found for both within-run and day-to-day assays. The limit of detection was 5.0 ng/ml. No interferences were found with tricyclic antidepressant drugs and benzodiazepines, which allows this method to be used in clinical studies, Pharmacokinetic parameters for the two compounds are reported in mouse serum, frontal cortex and caudate nucleus. We also report the values of FLU and N-FLU in serum from humans who were treated once daily with 20 mg of FLU, obtained after 1, 14 and 28 days of treatment.", 
    "119": "A novel mathematical approach for investigation of drug-human serum albumin (HSA) interactions by means of high-performance liquid affinity chromatography is developed. The model is based on the assumption that two types of competitive binding sites exist on the HSA molecule. The widely used single-site binding equation is extended and a proper mathematical analysis is proposed allowing the determination of the major parameters characterizing the multisite binding (cobinding) process. The utility of the new approach is proved by competitive studies on HSA binding of two model drugs, diazepam and diclofenac.", 
    "120": "Animal experiments suggest that epileptic seizures alter the expression of mRNA for neuro-receptors. PET measurements with [11C]flumazenil show that patients with partial seizures have a reduced density of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in the epileptogenic regions (ER) and some of the target areas for seizure activity, the so called projection areas. Recent data suggest that the degree of BZ receptor reduction in ER is correlated to seizure frequency. We therefore hypothesized that seizure activity can alter the BZ receptor binding, and that some of these changes could normalize when the seizures disappeared.", 
    "121": "In 4 patients whose seizures were generated by mesial temporal lobe structures, BZ receptor density was measured with [11C]flumazenil PET before, and 1 year after the epilepsy surgery and cessation of seizures. By use of a computerized anatomical brain atlas the same regions were analyzed in both PET scans, and the results related to data from 7 healthy controls.", 
    "122": "Presurgical PET scans showed reductions in BZ receptor density in the epileptogenic region and some of its primary projection areas. Other cortical regions had normal values. Postsurgically, the calculated BZ receptor density normalized (29+/-17% increase) in several of the affected projection areas, whereas the values in other cortical regions remained unaltered.", 
    "123": "Regional reductions in BZ receptor density may be dynamic and related to seizures. The present preliminary observations encourage further studies on seizure-related changes in regional receptor binding in humans.", 
    "124": "Saccadic eye movement was measured in three studies in a tracking task in which increasing stimulus jumping frequency indicates increasing difficulty. In the first study, after taking a benzodiazepine 16 subjects showed decreased saccadic velocity (activation indicator), but their reaction times and anticipatory behaviour (performance indicators) did not parallel this decline, although the saccadic amplitudes did. In the second deactivation study 23 subjects worked on somewhat boring oculomotor tasks for 2 h and showed the same decrease in saccadic velocity but showed almost no performance decline. In the third study a large sample of 254 subjects performed the same short tracking task, which offered the detailed analysis of the correspondence of the saccadic activation indicator to saccadic performance indicators. Almost all correlations were zero correlations. Thus, while performance seems to be practically independent of changing activation, the latter is dependent upon performance from one moment to the next. Stable differences were found between anticipatory and reactive saccades, which indicate an immediate change of saccadic velocity when the response mode changes. Therefore a reformulation of the relationship between performance and activation is proposed. Performance is stabilized by 'concentration' in a two-stage regulation process, i.e., it resists changing activation (for example through fatigue). In the second stage, the 'effort loop', additional brainstem activation is demanded when concentration alone fails to reach the goals that were set by the subject for his performance.", 
    "125": "The present study was aimed at elucidating the relationship between brain beta-endorphin, which was estimated by the immunofluorescence method, and fatal drug toxicities due to cocaine and combined cocaine-ethanol administration, including the late fatal toxicities clinically noted. beta-endorphin is an endogenous opioid peptide, and its secretion has been suggested to be influenced by physiological stresses. Furthermore, since protection against these fatal toxicities has been previously reported to be provided by buprenorphine (a ligand for opioid receptors) and Ro 15-4513 (a ligand for benzodiazepine receptors), this study also focused on the relationship between the effects of these two ligands and the changes in brain beta-endorphin immunoreactivity. In the fatal toxicity study, a toxic dose (75 mg/kg, i.p.) of cocaine combined with and without ethanol (3 g/kg, i.p.) was administered to the rats, with and without buprenorphine (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) or Ro 15-4513 (5, 10, 15 mg/kg, i.p.). All of the deaths that occurred in these animals were divided into two groups: early deaths with early toxic symptoms in which the drugs were detected in the tissue samples, and late deaths with late toxic symptoms in which no drugs were detected in the samples. Without the administration of buprenorphine or Ro 15-4513, the frequency of late deaths was higher in the cocaine group as compared to the cocaine-ethanol group. The total mortality rate was effectively attenuated by treatment with 0.25 mg/kg buprenorphine or 10 mg/kg Ro 15-4513. Following treatment with 1 mg/kg buprenorphine or 15 mg/kg Ro 15-4513, the frequency of late deaths was significantly enhanced in the cocaine group. The brain and liver cocaethylene concentrations were also attenuated in those groups in which the total mortality rates were attenuated. In the brain beta-endorphin immunoreactivity study, the number of beta-endorphin immunoreactive nerve cells at the arcuate nucleus was counted at 3 minutes or 24 hours after the drug treatment. At 3 minutes after the drug treatment, the number of weakly immunoreactive cells with photographic light absorption values greater than 50% was enhanced in the groups in which the frequency of late deaths had been increased. In the cocaine-ethanol groups treated with buprenorphine or Ro 15-4513, this enhancement of weakly immunoreactive cells was observed when the total mortality rate was increased, regardless of the type of death. At 24 hours after the drug treatment (50 mg/kg cocaine), an enhancement of the weakly immunoreactive cells only was observed in all of the groups in which the occurrence of toxicities had been enhanced, regardless of the type of toxicity. Therefore, it can be concluded that the enhancement of total brain beta-endorphin immunoreactivity was closely correlated with the increase in the frequency of total fatal toxicities, and that the enhancement of weakly immunoreactive cells was closely correlated with the increase in the frequency of delayed fatal toxicities.", 
    "126": "In this paper, we have reviewed the possibility of the functional involvement of an endogeneous neuropeptide for benzodiazepine receptors, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), in the development of drug dependence and the establishment of its withdrawal symptoms. The cerebral levels of DBI protein and its mRNA significantly increased in alcohol-dependent mice, and alcohol-withdrawal caused further increases of both DBI protein and its mRNA. These increases in the mouse cerebral cortex diminished over 14 days after alcohol-withdrawal. In the cerebrocortical neurons, similar patterns of DBI protein and its mRNA were observed during long-term exposure to alcohol and after its withdrawal. Simultaneous exposures of benzodiazepine receptor agonist, antagonist and inverse agonist with alcohol abolished the alcohol-induced increase in DBI mRNA expression in the neurons. Furthermore, the DBI contents and its mRNA expressions were also increased in the cerebral cortex obtained from nicotine-dependent mice and the neurons after long-term treatment with nicotine. The nicotine-induced increases in DBI content and its mRNA expression in the mouse cerebral cortex and the neurons were completely abolished in the presence of an antagonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. These results suggest that the changes in the levels of cerebral DBI induced by continuous treatments with alcohol and nicotine may be involved in the establishment of dependence by alcohol and nicotine, and such changes may be regulated by the benzodiazepine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively.",

Drug doses were assessed in 504 patients and complications caused by anesthesia analyzed. Intravenous anesthesia with combinations of diprivan, diazepam (relanium), calipsol, and tramal is preferable. The most prevalent complication of anesthesia which requires special treatment is aseptic postinjection phlebitis, most incident after sombrevin."
