Results demonstrate that (1) Intravitreal injections of the M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine were more effective at preventing form-deprivation myopia than subconjunctival injections. (2) Maximum drug levels were reached within 1 hr for both retina and sclera following intravitreal (28 and 11 nanomole) and subconjunctival (0.25 and 1 nanomole) injection. Intravitreal injection proved a more effective route of drug delivery to all ocular tissues compared to subconjunctival injection. (3) Elimination times of pirenzepine from ocular tissues were much shorter than those reported for blood plasma. (4) Histological examination revealed no evidence of gross toxic effects at doses effective in inhibiting induced axial myopia. In conclusion, pirenzepine was effective at reducing form-deprivation myopia in a dose-dependent manner with no evidence of disruption to the retina. However, results were not conclusive as to where pirenzepine may have its site of action in preventing form-deprivation myopia.", 
    "1": "Plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in 10 outpatients with panic disorder, twice (at a 48-h interval) before and twice on days 30-32 of treatment with alprazolam (2-2.5 mg/day), and twice in 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. TNF-alpha concentrations did not differ in patients and control subjects, either before therapy or at days 30-32 of therapy. In five patients before therapy, and in three of them after therapy, TNF-alpha values were higher than the maximal concentrations of the cytokine in controls.", 
    "2": "Activation of muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (mAChRs) increases excitability of pyramidal cells by inhibiting several K+ conductances, including the after-hyperpolarization current (Iahp), the M-current (Im), and a leak K+ conductance (Ileak). Based on pharmacological evidence and the abundant localization of M1 receptors in pyramidal cells, it has been assumed that the M1 receptor is responsible for mediating these effects. However, given the poor selectivity of the pharmacological agents used to characterize these mAChR responses, rigorous characterization of the receptor subtypes that mediate these actions has not been possible. Surprisingly, patch clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in M1 knockout mice revealed no significant difference in the degree of inhibition of Iahp, Im, or Ileak by the mAChR agonist, carbachol (CCh), as compared with wildtype controls. In addition, the M1-toxin was not able to block CCh's inhibition of the Iahp, Im, or Ileak These data demonstrate that the M1 receptor is not involved in increasing CA1 pyramidal cell excitability by mediating ACh effects on these K+ conductances.", 
    "3": "Two of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, GABAA and GABAC, are ligand-gated chloride channels expressed by neurons in the retina and throughout the central nervous system. The different subunit composition of these two classes of GABA receptor result in very different physiological and pharmacological properties. Although little is known at the molecular level as to the subunit composition of any native GABA receptor, it is thought that GABAC receptors are homomeric assemblies of rho-subunits. However, we found that the kinetic and pharmacological properties of homomeric receptors formed by each of the rho-subunits cloned from perch retina did not resemble those of the GABAC receptors on perch bipolar cells. Because both GABAA and GABAC receptors are present on retinal bipolar cells, we attempted to determine whether subunits of these two receptor classes are capable of interacting with each other. We report here that, when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, heteromeric (rho 1B gamma 2) receptors formed by coassembly of the rho 1B-subunit with the gamma 2-subunit of the GABAA receptor displayed response properties very similar to those obtained with current recordings from bipolar cells. In addition to being unresponsive to bicuculline and diazepam, the time-constant of deactivation, and the sensitivities to GABA, picrotoxin and zinc closely approximated the values obtained from the native GABAC receptors on bipolar cells. These results provide the first direct evidence of interaction between GABA rho and GABAA receptor subunits. It seems highly likely that coassembly of GABAA and rho-subunits contributes to the molecular organization of GABAC receptors in the retina and perhaps throughout the nervous system.", 
    "4": "WSS-1 cells expressing (alpha 1 gamma 2)GABAA receptors show an augmented 36Cl- response to GABA in the presence of amitriptyline that is increased by flumazenil, unlike augmentation by diazepam which is blocked by flumazenil. This amitriptyline effect is opposite to the inhibition of GABA-stimulated 36Cl influx manifested in membrane vesicles prepared from drug-naive rats or submissive rats (a model of depression) but is similar to that seen in tissue from amitriptyline-treated rats or dominant rats. The results suggest a novel mechanism of antidepressant drug action having a delayed onset.", 
    "5": "Stress-induced alterations in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) density have been reported in humans and in rats. However, the PBR response is highly specific, and its function remains largely unexplained. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between behavior in the two-way active avoidance paradigm (2WAA) and post-test PBR densities in adrenal, testis, kidney, and cerebral cortex. Adult male Wistar rats were tested in the 2WAA either in the naive state (AA) or 24 h following shock preexposure (PE), known to interfere with avoidance/escape response acquisition, and decapitated immediately after testing. Control subjects were decapitated without experimental experience. The stressful characteristic of the experiment was validated by significantly increased post-test corticosterone levels in AA and PE subjects compared with controls, with a trend towards higher corticosterone levels in PE relative to AA rats. Similarly, PE compared with AA subjects tended to show retarded acquisition of the escape/avoidance response. PBR densities in adrenal, kidney, and testis and central benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) in the cerebral cortex remained unaffected by avoidance testing. Cerebral cortex PBR density was significantly increased in PE subjects. These findings suggest that avoidance testing, although stressful to the animals, led to changes confined to cerebral cortex PBR, indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response occurs independently of the PBR response in peripheral organs, and also suggest that the opportunity for coping alters the impact of the stressor on the subject and prevents the expression of PBR response in peripheral organs.", 
    "6": "We conducted a prospective pilot study to assess the feasibility and safety of high-dose busulfan/melphalan as conditioning therapy prior to autologous PBPC transplantation in pediatric patients with high-risk solid tumors. From January 1995 to January 1999, 30 patients aged 2-21 years (median 8) were entered into the study. There were 14 females and 16 males. Diagnoses included neuroblastoma in 10 patients; Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) in 15 patients and rhabdomyosarcoma in five patients. Treatment consisted of busulfan 16 mg/kg, orally over 4 days (from days -5 to -2) in 6 hourly divided doses, and melphalan at a dose of 140 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion over 5 min on day -1. G-CSF mobilized PBPC were used as autologous stem-cell rescue. One patient developed a single generalized convulsion during busulfan therapy. The most relevant non-hematologic toxicity was gastrointestinal, manifesting as grade 2-3 mucositis and diarrhea in 12 patients. Two patients died of procedure-related complications, one from veno-occlusive disease of liver and multiorgan failure and the other from adult respiratory distress syndrome. Probability of treatment-related mortality was 6.6 +/- 4.5%. With a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 1-48), 19 patients are alive and disease-free, the actuarial EFS at 4 years being 55 +/- 12% for the whole group. We conclude that high-dose busulfan/melphalan for autologous transplantation in children with solid tumors is feasible even in small patients. It is well-tolerated, with an acceptable transplant-related mortality and has proven antitumor activity.", 
    "7": "Recent epidemiologic data indicate that the vast majority of children with febrile seizures have a normal longterm outcome. A precise knowledge of the short- and long-term outcome with or without treatment, and short- and long-term side effects is an important prerequisite for assessing the various treatment strategies. We focus on the impact of short-term or prophylactic treatment on the short- and long-term outcome of various types of febrile seizures. There is universal agreement that daily prophylaxis with antiepileptic agents should never be used routinely in simple febrile seizures, but only in highly selected cases, if at all. Intermittent diazepam (DZP) prophylaxis at times of fever may or may not reduce the recurrence rate, but it does not appear to improve the long-term outcome as compared with short-term seizure control. The treatment may be used to reduce the recurrence rate for a small arbitrarily defined group with multiple simple febrile seizures, complex febrile seizures, especially focal, prolonged or both, febrile status, and when parental anxiety is severe. However, there is no evidence that treatment of simple febrile seizures can prevent the rare cases of later epilepsy, and many children with complex febrile seizures have a benign long-term outcome, even without treatment. Many prefer a \"wait and see\" policy. An attractive alternative is to treat new febrile seizures with rectal DZP in solution at seizure onset, given by the parents at home to prevent febrile status. Newer, less well documented short-term strategies include nasal, oral, or rectal administration of other benzodiazepines. Short-term seizure control of febrile status and careful parental counseling are the two most important targets of treatment.",

At the autopsy only a slight decomposition and a diffuse visceral congestion were noticed. Biological samples obtained at autopsy were analysed to detect the presence of alprazolam, tramadol and alcohol. Blood concentrations of alprazolam, alcohol and tramadol were 0.21 mg/l, 1.29 g/kg and 38.3 mg/l, respectively.", 
    "9": "The aim of this investigation was to examine the deaths of drug addicts from poisoning in the county of Funen in 1995 and 1996. The cause of death was related to drugs on the illicit market. Social conditions (homelessness, involvement in crime, psychogenic disease, circumstance of death) are discussed. The study included 47 drug addicts. Median age was 34, age span: 20-43. The main cause of death was poisoning by heroin. In 28% of the drug addicts cocaine was detected and in 13% amphetamine. About half had used benzodiazepines. Few were employees, most were criminals and eight were homeless. Thirty-eight percent were found in public lavatories. Eight had a serious psychiatric diagnosis. We can conclude that the drug addicts are socially marginalized. They abused a mixture of drugs. The drugs detected in the drug addicts compared well with the drugs on the illicit market and cocaine had gained access to the market.", 
    "10": "This study was designed to evaluate 2 combinations for immobilization of bison. Seven wood bison received 1.5 mg/kg body weight (BW) of xylazine HCl + 1.5 mg/kg BW of zolazepam HCl and 1.5 mg/kg BW of tiletamine HCl on one occasion. The bison received 60 micrograms/kg BW of medetomidine HCl + 0.6 mg/kg BW of zolazepam HCl and 0.6 mg/kg BW of tiletamine HCL on another occasion. Xylazine was antagonized with 3 mg/kg BW of tolazoline HCl and medetomidine HCl was antagonized with 180 micrograms/kg (BW) of atipamezole HCl. Temporal characteristics of immobilization and physiological effects (acid-base status, thermoregulatory, cardiovascular, and respiratory effects) of the drug combinations were compared. Induction was significantly faster with xylazine HCl-zolazepam HCl/tiletamine HCl. Recovery following antagonist administration was significantly faster with medetomidine HCl-zolazepam HCl/tiletamine HCl. The average drug volumes required were 7.00 mL of xylazine HCl-zolazepam HCl/tiletamine HCL and 2.78 mL of medetomidine HCl-zolazepam HCl/tiletamine HCl. Hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and rumenal tympany were the major adverse effects with both drug combinations.", 
    "11": "The effects of preweaning experience in rats and mice on neuroendocrine and behavioral end points and their implications for prenatal drug effects are reviewed. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the dopaminergic system were shown to be affected. Behavior related to hippocampal, adrenocortical functions and to the benzodiazepine receptor system was also modified. Other paradigms (nociception, conditioned taste aversion) exhibited susceptibility to such preweaning manipulations also. The effects of these early experiences seem to be mediated through complex factors including neuroendocrine responses of the pup to hypothermia and a permanent alteration of mother-infant interactions, with subsequent effects on neuroendocrine functions that are important for postnatal brain organization. Studies of interactions between prenatal drug effects and preweaning manipulations have been performed only with ethanol. When extending this work to other compounds, the systems and functions described above may provide some guidance in looking for possible interactions. In most cases the preweaning manipulations alleviated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. These findings may have important implications regarding the controversy about environmental influences affecting the outcome of exposure to neurobehavioral teratogens.", 
    "12": "Several drug packages, including Subutex (high-dose buprenorphine, as sublingual tablets) boxes, were found near the corpse of a 25-year-old male drug addict, who apparently had committed suicide. The autopsy revealed a fatal respiratory depression. The toxicological investigations concluded that death resulted from massive burpienorphine intoxication. The determination of buprenorphine (BU) and norbuprenorphine (NBU) in all biological specimens was performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ES-MS) after hydrolysis (for solid tissues), deproteinization of the matrices, and solid-phase extraction of the compounds. Exceptionally high concentrations of BU and NBU were found in blood (3.3 and 0.4 mg/L, respectively), urine (3.4 and 0.6 mg/L), bile (2035 and 536 mg/L and brain (6.4 a nd 3.9 microg/g). The high concentration of BU (899 mg/L) and the absence of NBU in gastric liquid suggested oral intake. High concentrations of amino-7-flunitra/epam, the main metabolite of flunitra/epam, were also found in blood, urine and gastric liquid. This benzodiazepine may have been a co-factor in the toxic effects of BU.", 
    "13": "Stalking behavior has been associated with several mental disorders, both psychotic and non-psychotic. The most frequently associated condition appears to be an individual with primitive personality psychopathology regardless of co-occurring psychotic symptomatology. Among the psychotic symptoms, erotomanic, and jealousy delusions may be the most clinically and torensically relevant. However, delusional jealousy has not been well appreciated in the psychiatric literature as an important contributor to stalking behavior. In this article, we explore the psychiatric, psychosocial, and forensic aspects of stalking in the context of delusional jealousy. We use a case example to highlight important issues in this area.", 
    "14": "To compare the characteristics of dextropropoxyphene (DXP) poisoning victims with those of victims of poisonings by antidepressants and sedatives, we examined all fatal poisonings due to DXP, antidepressants or sedatives among autopsies performed at one department of forensic medicine in Sweden during the six-year period from 1992 to 1997. In 202 cases, death was classified as fatal poisonings by DXP, antidepressants or sedatives. DXP caused death in 78 cases (39%), antidepressants in 49 (24%), and sedatives in 75 (37%). DXP as a single preparation was predominant in causing death. The second compound, flunitrazepam, caused death in 30 cases (15%). The victims of poisonings by DXP, antidepressants, or sedatives shared a similar history of alcohol/drug abuse, depression and somatic illness. They were mostly living alone at the time of death (>60%), the majority died at home (81%), and suicide was the most frequent manner of death (73%). Age seemed to be an important characteristic regarding the choice of drug. Younger people predominantly died of DXP (mean age 43 years, 95% confidence interval, CI 39-47), and elderly people of sedatives (mean age 59 years, CI 55-63). Antidepressants were found mainly in middle-aged victims (mean age 51 years, CI 48-54). The predominance of sedatives among the elderly might be explained by a very high prescription rate of such drugs in older age groups, but prescription rate could not explain the DXP predominance among younger people. We hypothesize that younger people are more prone to abuse therapeutic drugs for euphoric reasons than elderly people, and that because of its high toxicity, DXP leads to accidental deaths more often than sedatives.", 
    "15": "Deficient inhibitory neurotransmission of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on postmortem studies. However, in vivo studies have shown predominantly negative or conflicting results. The goal of this study was to better characterize possible changes of the regional GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor distribution volume (BZR V3-p) in schizophrenia in vivo, using a larger sample size than previous studies. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]iomazenil was used with a constant infusion paradigm to measure the BZR V3-p under sustained radiotracer equilibrium conditions. Twenty-five patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy control subjects were studied. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) ratings were done in all subjects. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 96 was used to compare patients and control subjects as well as to study the relationship between SPECT results and composite PANSS scores based on two factorial models: the pentagonal model (positive, negative, dysphoric mood, activation, and autistic preoccupation factors) and the taxometric model (disorganized dimension). On the basis of 'absolute' values of V3-p with no normalization for total brain uptake, the schizophrenic patients showed no significant differences in BZR levels compared to the healthy control subjects. With a global normalization procedure, which is more sensitive to relative regional differences in activity, BZR V3-p was significantly decreased in the patients in the left precentral gyrus (BA 6). The relative BZR V3-p showed a significant positive correlation with duration of illness in the superior occipital gyri (BA 19). No significant correlations were observed between either absolute or relative BZR V3-p and either age or any of the composite PANSS scores based on any of the two factorial models in either patients or control subjects. No significant differences were observed between cigarette smoking vs. non-smoking patients, nor between the patients on atypical antipsychotics vs. on typical antipsychotics vs. not on any antipsychotics. In general, no significant differences in BZR V3-p were observed between patients and control subjects, except for a decrease in relative BZR V3-p in the left precentral gyrus. Grey matter atrophy is unlikely to be the cause for this decrease. However, we could not exclude that possibility. The positive correlation with duration of illness might reflect the relative preservation of neurons expressing BZR in the superior occipital gyri as compared to other cortical brain regions in schizophrenia.", 
    "16": "Valproic acid (VPA) is administered for a variety of indications in neurology and psychiatry. The intravenous form of VPA, valproate, has been used extensively by neurologists since the 1980s for patients with status epilepticus, as serum levels can be achieved rapidly and telemetry is not required during administration. Psychiatrists have less experience with intravenous valproate, and little is documented in the literature regarding its nonepileptic indications. Patients who are unable or unwilling to take drugs orally, or for whom rapid treatment is clinically indicated, may benefit from VPA. Neuroleptics and benzodiazepines often are given parenterally; however, they may be accompanied by side effects. Intravenous valproate was administered successfully to three patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. It is hoped that this report will increase clinicians' awareness of this important and well-tolerated treatment option.",

    "24": "The study objectives were to examine the effects of the atypical antipsychotic drugs olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine on core temperature in the rat in relation to such effects produced by clozapine and to compare possible in vivo intrinsic efficacy of olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine at dopamine (DA) D(1) receptors with such effects previously shown for clozapine. Core temperature measurements were made in adult male Wistar rats maintained under standard laboratory conditions using a reversed 12-h daylight cycle. Clozapine (0-32 micromol/kg s.c.), olanzapine (0-32 micromol/kg s.c.), and risperidone (0-4 micromol/kg s.c.) all produced a dose-dependent hypothermia. Except for slight nondose-dependent hyperthermia, there were no effects of quetiapine (0-16 micromol/kg s.c. or i.p.) on the core temperature. The hypothermia produced by clozapine, but not that produced by equipotent doses of olanzapine or risperidone, was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the DA D(1) receptor antagonist SCH-23,390 (0.1 micromol/kg s.c.). On the other hand, quinpirole-induced hypothermia (4 micromol/kg s.c.) was partially antagonized by olanzapine (2 micromol/kg s.c.), risperidone (4 micromol/kg s.c.), and quetiapine (16 micromol/kg s.c.) but not by clozapine (1 micromol/kg s.c.). Clozapine preferentially stimulates DA D(1) receptors in comparison with olanzapine and risperidone, whereas olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine preferentially block DA D(2) receptors compared with clozapine. It is suggested that stimulation of DA D(1) receptors, presumably in the prefrontal cortex, is a distinguishing feature of clozapine responsible for its favorable profile on cognitive functioning in schizophrenia.", 
    "25": "A detailed investigation of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release from primary embryonic septal cultures is described in this study. Applications of veratridine (25 microM) or increasing extracellular concentrations of K(+) (6-100 mM) induced robust increases of endogenous ACh release ( approximately 500-15,000 fmol/well/10 min). Release stimulated with K(+) (25 mM) was sustainable and did not differ significantly over 180 min. ACh release was dependent on extracellular choline and decreased proportionally to choline concentrations (0-10 microM). For example, after 30 min of stimulation with K(+) (25 mM), release in the absence of extracellular choline was approximately 25% of that associated with 10 microM choline. The vesicular transport blocker vesamicol (0-5 microM) almost completely prevented stimulated and basal ACh release at the highest concentration evaluated, which suggests a mostly vesicular mode of release in this model. The M(2)-like muscarinic receptor antagonist AF-DX 384 (0-10 microM) enhanced stimulated ACh release ( approximately 150% at the highest concentration evaluated), whereas the nonspecific muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine (0-10 microM) decreased stimulated release (approximately 60% at the highest concentration evaluated), suggesting that functional muscarinic autoreceptors exist in primary embryonic septal cultures. Novel findings concerning ACh release from primary embryonic septal cultures are reported herein, and the demonstration of ACh release gives further credit to the use of these cultures for studying cholinergic system functioning and in relation to physiology and pathology.", 
    "26": "Midazolam (MDZ) and triazolam (TRZ) hydroxylation, reactions considered to be cytochrome P-4503A (CYP3A)-mediated in humans, were examined in mouse and human liver microsomes. In both species, alpha- and 4-hydroxy metabolites were the principal products. Western blotting with anti-CYP3A1 antibody detected a single band of immunoreactive protein in both human and mouse samples: 0.45 +/- 0. 12 and 2.02 +/- 0.24 pmol/mg protein (mean +/- S.E., n = 3), respectively. Ketoconazole potently inhibited MDZ and TRZ metabolite formation in human liver microsomes (IC(50) range, 0.038-0.049 microM). Ketoconazole also inhibited the formation of both TRZ metabolites and of 4-OH-MDZ formation in mouse liver microsomes (IC(50) range, 0.0076-0.025 microM). However, ketoconazole (10 microM) did not produce 50% inhibition of alpha-OH-MDZ formation in mouse liver microsomes. Anti-CYP3A1 antibodies produced concentration-dependent inhibition of MDZ and TRZ metabolite formation in human liver microsomes and of TRZ metabolite and 4-OH-MDZ formation in mouse liver microsomes to less than 20% of control values but reduced alpha-OH-MDZ formation to only 66% of control values in mouse liver microsomes. Anti-CYP2C11 antibodies inhibited alpha-OH-MDZ metabolite formation in a concentration-dependent manner to 58% of control values in mouse liver microsomes but did not inhibit 4-OH-MDZ formation. Thus, TRZ hydroxylation appears to be CYP3A specific in mice and humans. alpha-Hydroxylation of MDZ has a major CYP2C component in addition to CYP3A in mice, demonstrating that metabolic profiles of drugs in animals cannot be assumed to reflect human metabolic patterns, even with closely related substrates.", 
    "27": "The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of spinal cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists on morphine antinociception in a model of visceral nociception, colorectal distension, in rats with chronic colonic inflammation and vehicle-treated controls. Three to five days after intracolonic instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), an enhanced visceromotor response to all pressures of colorectal distension (10-80 mm Hg) was evident. The ED(50) of intrathecal morphine (0.93 microgram) in vehicle-treated rats produced significantly greater antinociception in TNBS-treated rats. Intrathecal proglumide, a nonselective CCK receptor antagonist, dose dependently enhanced the antinociceptive effect of morphine in vehicle-treated rats, but not in TNBS-treated rats. Similarly, L-365, 260, a specific CCK(B) receptor antagonist, dose dependently increased morphine's antinociceptive effects in vehicle-treated rats but had no effect in rats with TNBS-induced colonic inflammation. L-364,718, a specific CCK(A) receptor antagonist, had no effect on morphine antinociception in either vehicle-treated or TNBS-treated rats. These data indicate that CCK, acting at the CCK(B) receptor, is involved in modulating morphine antinociception following a noxious visceral stimulus. However, CCK receptor antagonists no longer enhance morphine antinociception after instillation of intracolonic TNBS, suggesting that visceral inflammation may lead to a reduction in spinal CCK release.",

    "45": "The data concern 2322 patients recruited over a 3-year period. Three-quarters of the cohort were prescribed antipsychotic drugs, one-half received benzodiazepines and nearly one-third received antidepressants. The trends in drug use from 1994 to 1997 show that for patients with schizophrenia there has been a decrease in the prescription of typical neuroleptics: the use of haloperidol passed from 56% to 42.4% and that of chlorpromazine dropped from 13.5% to 6.1%; during the same period, an increasing use of the atypical compound risperidone was observed. Among patients suffering from unipolar affective psychosis, the prescriptions of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not changed in time, while the proportion of patients receiving neuroleptic drugs has increased from 41% to 45.2%. In addition, the use of antiepileptic drugs and lithium increased, irrespective of diagnosis. Almost 40% of the patients on psychotropic drugs received three or more drugs. Finally, a positive association was found between the number of prescribed compounds and the daily dose administered.", 
    "46": "These data indicate that in the absence of a rational approach to drug use, a symptomatic approach is generally adopted, by which common sense, experience, information provided by non-independent agencies and other cultural parameters play an important role in the prescription strategy. Pharmacoepidemiology should more often consider the use of drugs as a dependent variable, to be investigated within the context of other clinical, cultural, social and setting-related parameters; this approach would enable a more comprehensive assessment of prescribing practices and strategies in routine clinical care.", 
    "47": "Absence status (AS), or \"Petit Mal status\" is a polymorphic condition that can complicate many epileptic syndromes. Diagnosis is difficult on the basis of clinical semiology alone, and requires emergency EEG. Although heterogeneous, the most typical ictal pattern is constituted by slow generalized rhythmic spike-waves (SW) or polyspike-waves (PSW) complexes. In a number of cases, clinical and EEG normalization is obtained after intravenous (i.v.) benzodiazepine (BZ) injection. In some difficult cases, neuropsychological investigations before and after BZ injection is useful: a significant improvement of the neuropsychological score should occur following BZ injection. On a nosographic point of view, literature data indicate that 4 types of AS may be recognized. Typical AS occurs as part of an idiopathic generalised epilepsy most often characterized by absences. Isolated impairment of consciousness, at times with subtle jerks of the eyelids, is the essential symptomatology. The EEG correlates with repetitive absence seizures and shows symmetric and bilateral synchronous SW or PSW complexes faster than 3 Hz. The immediate prognosis is excellent. Atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies and is characterized by a fluctuating confusional state with more prominent tonic and/or myoclonic and/or lateralized ictal manifestations than occur in typical AS. The EEG shows continuous or intermittent diffuse irregular slow SW or PSW complexes. The immediate prognosis is guarded, as these episodes tend to recur and to be resistant to medication. \"De novo\" absence status of late onset is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged or elderly subjects with no previous history of epilepsy. Patients often have a history of psychiatric illness with multiple psychotropic drug intake. The electroclinical characteristics and the immediate prognosis are variable. These episodes of AS generally represent acute symptomatic seizures and may not recur if the triggering factors can be controlled or corrected. Long-term antiepileptic drugs may thus not be needed. Absence status with focal characteristics occur in subjects with a pre-existing or newly developing partial epilepsy, most often of extra-temporal origin. The EEG shows bilateral but often asymmetric ictal discharges. The immediate prognosis is variable. Some of these cases are difficult to distinguish from complex partial status epilepticus of frontal lobe origin.",

As well as in patients with basilar migraine, the association of migraine and coma may also be seen in patients with familial hemiplegic migraine and CADASIL and MELAS syndromes. It may be that gabaergic mechanisms are involved in the theoretical dysfunction of the ascending reticular activating system causing alteration of consciousness, since in the three patients in whom flumazenil was injected, there was a response.",

Cortical brainstem auditory evoked potentials in ten patients displayed P300 wave and vertex potential alterations. Five cases received 1-3 mg/kg/day prednisone during 6-12 months, with almost complete speech recovery in four. At the last follow-up, language impairment was mild in five patients, moderate in five and severe in three, while two children recovered normal speech.",

    "55": "The allocentric place discrimination task (APDT) is useful in evaluating working memory separately from and simultaneously with motivation, motor and sensory ability. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine has been shown to selectively impair the accuracy of APDT without changing swimming speed, distance, and still time. For further evaluation of other neurotransmitters' roles in the APDT, pharmacological manipulations were performed. Neither diazepam 3.0 mg/kg, mecamylamine 10 mg/kg, haloperidol 0.5 mg/kg, nor 8-OH DPAT 1.0 mg/kg affected accuracy of place discrimination. Two kinds of responses were observed following the administration of MK-801 0.3 mg/kg: the accuracy of rats for longer swimming distance tended to decrease, and the accuracy of rats for normal swimming distance did not change. Therefore, NM-801 did not seem to affect the working memory selectively. In addition, neither flumazenil 10 mg/kg, ondansetron 0.3 mg/kg nor R(-)-alpha-metylhistamine 10 mg/kg attenuated the scopolamine-induced deficits. These results suggest that the central muscarinic receptors are selectively and highly important in the APDT.", 
    "56": "Records of behavior (alertness, posture, oro-nasal responses, activity level, and vocalization pattern) were made in prepubertal pigs (n = 6) during a 60-min period following central injections of equimolar (21 nmol) doses of porcine CRH (pCRH), urocortin (UCN), octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), or saline vehicle (SAL). Blood samples were also collected at 15-min intervals before, during, and after the test, and used to determine plasma cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone concentrations. The pigs became excited and highly active after pCRH, and to a lesser extent following UCN administration, but were subdued when given ODN or SAL. None of the peptides significantly affected prolactin or growth hormone release, but both UCN, and especially pCRH, increased cortisol concentrations. The emotional responses induced by pCRH and UCN are consistent with observations in rodents, which indicate that centrally administered CRH-like peptides have anxiogenic effects. In contrast, ODN, which inhibits benzodiazepine binding at the GABA(A) receptor and is anxiogenic in rodents, lowered plasma cortisol and had no overt behavioral effects. Hence, at the dose administered, there was no evidence to indicate that ODN acted as an anxiogen in this species.", 
    "57": "The sensitivity of prenatally protein-malnourished rats to the amnestic properties of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), was studied in the male offspring of rats provided with a protein-deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. Rats were tested during acquisition of the submerged platform version of the Morris water maze task using three systemic doses of CDP (3.2, 5.6, and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) at two ages (day 30 and day 90). At 30 days, prenatally malnourished rats showed less sensitivity to the amnestic effect of the 5.6-mg/kg dose when compared with well-nourished controls by displaying shorter swim paths during acquisition and a more selective search of the target quadrant upon removal of the platform (probe trial). At 90 days, prenatally malnourished rats again showed less sensitivity to CDP at a dose of 5.6 mg/kg, but more sensitivity to the 3.2-mg/kg dose (indicated on the probe trial). No obvious relationship was identified between the nutritional group differences in behavioral sensitivity to CDP at 90 days and their BZ receptor density in the hippocampus or medial septum. It can be concluded that prenatal malnutrition alters the amnestic response to CDP in a dose-dependent and developmentally specific manner, thus providing further support for functional changes within the GABAergic system subsequent to malnutrition.", 
    "58": "The distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of neophobic BALB/c mice was studied by autoradiographic analysis using [3H]-diazepam and compared to that of the same receptors of the \"nonemotional\" C57BL/6 mice. This technique revealed no significant interstrain difference except for a lower density of diazepam binding sites in the amygdala of BALB/c mice. Therefore, the expression of benzodiazepine receptors in the amygdala of the two strains of mice were quantified by binding studies on brain membranes. The amygdala of BALB/c mice exhibited a fivefold decrease in the density of benzodiazepine receptors compared to C57BL/6 mice. These results suggest that the trait anxiety (neophobia) that characterizes BALB/c mice could be due, at least in part, to a genetic modulation of benzodiazepine receptor expression in the amygdala, a structure known to be strongly involved in fear behavior.", 
    "59": "The behavioral effects of crotoxin (CTX), the major component of Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, were studied in rats submitted to the open field, holeboard, and social interaction tests. CTX (100, 250, and 500 microg/kg, i.p.) was administered 2 h before the tests. In the open field, CTX reduced ambulation (250 microg/kg) and rearing (250 and 500 microg/kg) and increased grooming (100 and 250 microg/kg) and freezing (250 microg/kg). In the holeboard and social interaction, all the CTX doses evaluated decreased, respectively, head dip and head dipping, and social interaction time. The CTX-induced behavioral alterations could be attributed to its neuromuscular transmission blockade, but this possibility was ruled out because CTX (250 and 500 microg/kg, i.p., 2 h before the rotarod test) was unable to modify the rotarod performance of rats. The involvement of the benzodiazepine receptor in the CTX-induced behavioral alterations was investigated through the pretreatment (30 min before the tests, i.p.) of the animals with diazepam (1.2 mg/kg), or flumazenil (4 and 10 mg/kg). Both diazepam and flumazenil antagonized the CTX-induced behavioral alterations in the open field, holeboard, and social interaction tests. This study demonstrated that: (1) CTX is an anxiogenic compound; and (2) the gabaergic-benzodiazepine system may play a role in the CTX-induced anxiogenic effect.",

Out of 116 patients, 2 experienced coronary sinus rupture for which they were converted to standard conventional approach. All patients had done well postoperatively.

In contrast, LPC 1 responded with increased cell number to CCK-8S and decreased cell number to the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide. LPC 2, 6, and 7 were stimulated by CCK-8S, gastrin-17, and their antagonists. LPC 3 showed decreased cell number after inhibition by the antagonists, and LPC 5 and 10 showed increased cell number after stimulation by CCK-8S and gastrin-17. LPC 4 was stimulated by CCK-8S, and LPC 8 was stimulated by all substances except gastrin-17. Intermittent administration of the substances to LN 36 led to a greater effect on the cell number than administration every day, which was not the case with LPC 1 and LPC 3. Bombesin led to an increased growth in LPC 5 but not in LPC 3.", 
    "65": "CCK-8S and gastrin-17 led to an increased cell number in some cell lines. A blockade of the CCK-A and CCK-B receptors by their antagonists led to an increased, an unaffected, or a decreased cell number of the cell lines. The effect of bombesin on different cell lines also varied. This shows a great heterogenicity among pancreatic cancer cells from different patients.", 
    "66": "The role of melatonin in the regulation of human reproduction remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the influence of exogenous melatonin on pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH), diurnal rhythm of testosterone, and endogenous melatonin profile in six healthy young adult males. To test the hypothesis that the effect of melatonin on LH or testosterone secretory patterns may be mediated through the benzodiazepine-(BNZ) gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptor complex, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (Flumazenil) was administered. The study design comprised four 10-h (4:00 PM-2:00 AM) testing periods. During each experimental period, subjects were given an oral dose of placebo, or 3 mg melatonin or 10 mg flumazenil, at 5:00 PM, in a randomized, double-blind, partially repeated Latin square design in the following combinations: placebo-placebo, placebo-melatonin, flumazenil-placebo, and flumazenil-melatonin. The following day, serum samples were obtained every 20 min between 4:00 PM and 2:00 AM in a controlled light-dark environment for the determination of LH and melatonin levels. Serum testosterone concentrations were determined every 20 min between 7:00 and 8:00 AM and 7:00 and 8:00 PM. A significant decrease in mean serum LH levels (p < 0.02) was observed in the melatonin-treated groups as compared with placebo-flumazenil groups. There was no change in LH pulse frequency, testosterone levels, or in melatonin onset time and amplitude. No additional effect of flumazenil on LH or testosterone levels was observed. These data indicate that an evening melatonin administration decreases the next-day LH secretion in normal adult males without altering testosterone levels or the endogenous nocturnal melatonin secretory pattern. This effect of melatonin is not mediated through the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex.",

EEG electrode positions relative to the brain surface were determined from MRI image volumes. Cortical areas of abnormal glucose metabolism or FMZ binding were determined objectively based on asymmetry measures derived from homotopic cortical areas at three asymmetry thresholds. PET data were then coregistered with the MRI and overlaid on the MRI surface. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the specificity and sensitivity of PET-defined abnormalities against the gold standard of intracranial EEG data.",

The title compounds V showed an affinity which depended directly on the presence of the N(10)-H group and an aromatic ring at position 3. Some of them elicited a 2- or 3-fold higher affinity with respect to that of the indolylglyoxylylamide derivatives IV (R = H). The GABA ratio and [(35)S]-tert-butylcyclophosphorothionate binding data revealed an efficacy profile of partial inverse agonists/antagonists for compounds 1c,e,f,j,k, and of a partial agonist for 2c.

    "83": "Pharmacophore/receptor models for three recombinant GABA(A)/BzR subtypes (alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha5beta3gamma2, and alpha6beta3gamma2) have been established via an SAR ligand-mapping approach. This study was based on the affinities of 151 BzR ligands at five distinct (alpha1-3,5,6beta3gamma2) recombinant GABA(A)/BzR receptor subtypes from at least nine different structural families. Examination of the included volumes of the alpha1-, alpha5-, and alpha6-containing subtypes indicated that region L(2) for the alpha5-containing subtype appeared to be larger in size than the analogous region of the other receptor subtypes. Region L(Di), in contrast, appeared to be larger in the alpha1 subtype than in the other two subtypes. Moreover, region L(3) in the alpha6 subtype is either very small or nonexistent in this diazepam-insensitive subtype (see Figure 16 for details) as compared to the other subtypes. Use of the pharmacophore/receptor models for these subtypes has resulted in the design of novel BzR ligands (see 27) selective for the alpha5beta3gamma2 receptor subtype. alpha5-Selective ligand 27 when injected directly into the hippocampus did enhance memory in one paradigm (Bailey et al., unpublished observations); however, systemic administration of either 9 or 27 into animals did not provide an observable enhancement. This result is in complete agreement with the observation of Liu (1996). It has been shown (Liu, 1996; Wisden et al., 1992) that in the central nervous system of the rat (as well as monkeys and pigeons) there are several native subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor which exhibit different functions, regional distributions, and neuronal locations. Although 27 binds more potently at alpha5beta3gamma2 receptor subtypes and is clearly an inverse agonist (Liu et al., 1996; Liu, 1996), it is possible that this ligand acts as an agonist at one or more subtypes. Liu (1996) clearly showed that a number of imidazobenzodiazepines were negative modulators at one subtype and agonists at another. Therefore, selectivity for a particular subtype at this point is not sufficient to rule out some physiological effect at other GABA(A)/BzR subtypes. The inability of 27 to potentiate memory when given systemically is again in support of this hypothesis, especially since alpha1beta2gamma2 subtypes are distributed throughout the brain (Wisden et al., 1992). A drug delivered systemically is far more likely to interact with all subtypes than one delivered to a specific brain region. This observation (systemic vs intrahippocampal) provides further support for the design of more subtype-specific ligands at the BzR to accurately define their pharmacology, one key to the design of new drugs with fewer side effects.",

We investigated the disposition of oral ALP (1 mg) and CAF (100 mg) in 17 normal volunteers to establish and validate a procedure for the simultaneous assessment of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzyme activity. Nine received ALP alone, ALP and CAF and CAF alone in an open three-way crossover study to test for pharmacokinetic interaction. Four received ALP after a 2-day pretreatment with ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and four normal volunteers received ALP after 4 days of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4. AUC values of ALP and CAF administered alone were not different from AUC values when both drugs were administered combined, indicating that there is no metabolic interaction. The ratio formed of paraxanthine and CAF correlated significantly with systemic CAF clearance at 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h. There was a strong correlation between AUC values of ALP and CAF and the plasma concentration obtained 6, 8, 10, or 24 h after ingestion of the drug. Ketoconazole and rifampin pretreatment significantly changed AUC values of ALP (mean AUC values in microg/l h: ALP = 242.2, ALP + ketoconazole = 426.2, ALP + rifampin = 28.4, ANOVA F = 17.7, P < 0.001). We conclude that ALP and CAF can be administered simultaneously for the assessment of CYP activity.

    "89": "To elucidate the role of opioid peptides in control of the anxiety-like behavior and anxiety-reducing actions of benzodiazepines, a recombinant, replication-defective herpes virus (SHPE) carrying human preproenkephalin cDNA was delivered to rat amygdala. Viral infection resulted in a strong, localized transgene expression after 2-4 days which diminished after one week. Anxiety-like behavior and the anxiolytic effect of diazepam were assessed three days after gene delivery using the elevated plus maze test. While SHPE infection alone did not reduce anxiety-like behavior, rats infected with SHPE exhibited a greater response to the anxiolytic effect of diazepam when compared to rats infected with a control virus (SHZ.1) containing the lacZ gene. The enhancement of diazepam action by SHPE was naloxone reversible, region-specific, and correlated with the time course of preproenkephalin expression. The findings implicate amygdalar opioid peptides in regulating the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of recombinant herpes virus in evaluating the role of single gene products within specific brain sites in pharmacological responses and complex behaviors.",

    "92": "A set of TIBO derivatives endowed with reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitory activity were analyzed by comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). Besides conventional steric and electrostatic fields, molecular lipophilicity potential (MLP) was also used as a third field in CoMFA. An informative and statistically significant model (q2 = 0.70, r2 = 0.90, s = 0.46) was obtained by taking into account the three field types together. The key molecular determinants governing the RT inhibition by TIBO congeners were detected at the 3-D level by a careful analysis of the CoMFA isocontour maps. To challenge the predictive ability of the CoMFA model, an external set of thiazolobenzimidazole (TBZ) derivatives were examined. Good predictions, suggesting a similar binding mode for TIBO and TBZ derivatives, emerged. Flexible docking experiments on TBZ, TIBO and other NNIs confirmed common binding characteristics, as found out also by CoMFA, and moreover a good correlation between calculated binding energies and inhibitory potency was found.", 
    "93": "Hepatitis C (HCV) is an indolent and often fatal disease affecting four million Americans commonly associated with low socioeconomic status. We assessed its prevalence in a sample of 334 consecutively admitted middle class substance abusers in a private urban hospital, and ascertained risk factors for its transmission. We found that the point prevalence rate for HCV was 27.7% among all substance abusers, and 76.7% among intravenous drug users. Using logistic regression, we found risk factors associated with HCV were intravenous drug use, needle sharing, prior liver disease, opioid dependence, HIV infection, and benzodiazepine dependence. Not found to increase infective risk were lower social class, male gender, African-American race, male homosexuality, unemployment, and the absence of private health insurance. Multiple viral genotype types were identified in this sample, suggesting diverse sources of transmission in the sample. This study documents an epidemic of HCV in an American middle class sample.", 
    "94": "Altered benzodiazepine sensitivity in subjects with a history of parental alcoholism (PHP) compared to control subjects (NC) has been reported for regional brain blood volume, eye movement tasks, and subjective effects. This study tests the hypothesis that PHP subjects are less sensitive to benzodiazepine effects on EEG activity than are NC subjects. Frontal EEG activity was recorded in PHP and NC subjects after administration of the benzodiazepine, alprazolam (1 mg), or placebo. PHP subjects had decreased sensitivity to the EEG effects of alprazolam compared to NC subjects. Significant differences were detected for change in percent relative beta activity and alpha and theta band power. Pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between groups. These results suggest that PHP subjects are less sensitive to the effects of alprazolam on central electrophysiological activity than are NC subjects.", 
    "95": "Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of hereditary blistering disorders for which there is no definitive therapy. Wound care is an important component of management. Regular dressing changes are required to protect blistered and eroded skin, and to prevent secondary infection and sepsis. These dressing changes can be very painful for patients with extensive erosions. We report our experience of pain management in an 11-year-old boy with severe junctional epidermolysis bullosa. Amitryptiline and cognitive behavioral techniques were effective in relieving chronic pain and discomfort. Oral midazolam 0.33 mg/kg administered 20 minutes prior to baths and dressing changes substantially improved his tolerance of wound care.", 
    "96": "The M1 muscarinic agonist CI-1017 was administered intravenously to aging rabbits on a daily basis before and during hippocampally dependent trace eyeblink conditioning sessions. Circulating levels of CI-1017 were significantly related to the drug dose. The drug was found to significantly increase the rate and amount of learning in a dose-dependent manner with no significant effects on the amplitude, area, or latency of conditioned responses. There was no evidence of pseudoconditioning at the highest drug concentration, and the minimally effective dose produced only mild and temporary hypersalivation as a side effect. CI-1017 (10 microM) was also found to increase the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded from hippocampal slices from young and aging naive rabbits as measured by changes in spike-frequency adaptation and the postburst afterhyperpolarization. These biophysical changes were reversed with either atropine (1 microM) or pirenzepine (1 microM). These results suggest that M1 agonists ameliorate age-related learning and memory impairments at least in part by reducing the afterhyperpolarization and spike-frequency adaptation of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and that M1 agonists may be an effective therapy for reducing the cognitive deficits that accompany normal aging and/or Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "97": "Recent studies have shown that cells in the intermediate zone (IZ) of the embryonic neocortex originate in the basal telencephalon and migrate tangentially in the cortical wall (;; ). We had previously observed growing cortical axons closely apposed to calbindin-positive, tangentially oriented cells in the IZ (), and it has been shown that neurites in the IZ express a glutamate transporter (). To test if glutamate released by corticofugal growth cones could influence the tangential IZ cells, we characterized the glutamate receptors expressed by IZ cells using patch-clamp techniques, histochemical labeling, and immunostaining on slices of embryonic mice forebrain. We show that tangential IZ cells express inwardly rectifying kainate responses, but not NMDA responses, and accumulate cobalt after AMPA receptor activation. We conclude that IZ cells express calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. This property correlates with our observation that the GluR2 subunit is not expressed in the IZ. AMPA receptors are activated by a millimolar concentration of glutamate. To know whether this high level of glutamate could occur at the surface of IZ cells, we examined contacts made by corticofugal growth cones and calbindin-positive IZ cells using electron microscopy. We show vesicle-containing neurites tightly apposed to calbindin-positive IZ cells over remarkably long length. This suggests that glutamate released by growing corticofugal axons could reach high concentrations close to AMPA receptors of tangential IZ cells and efficiently activate them to control the intracellular calcium in embryonic IZ cells.", 
    "98": "1. Effects of diazepam (DZP) or haloperidol (HAL) on convulsions and behavioral responses (locomotion, circling, spying and head shaking) induced by bilateral electrical stimulation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were examined. 2. Male Wistar rats were electrically stimulated (ten 30-sec trains, 60 Hz, 80-100 microA) bilaterally in the mPFC and their behavior was simultaneously observed in an open field in daily session. 3. DZP and HAL dose-response curves (0, 0.5, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before electrical stimulation session) were determined after a baseline of behavioral responses was established. 4. DZP dose-dependently decreased head shaking and convulsions, had no effect in circling and spying behaviors, and increased locomotion except at the highest dose. HAL reduced locomotion, circling and spying behaviors in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect convulsions or head shaking. 5. These results demonstrated that convulsion and behavioral responses induced by electrical activation of the mPFC were modified by DZP or HAL. Therefore, the mPFC is involved in the mediation of neural and/or behavioral activity that may be implicated in some central effects of psychoactive drugs.",

    "101": "GYKI 52466 (5 & 10 mg/kg) had no effect on operant responding for ethanol, but increased spontaneous locomotor activity, whereas the highest doses of NBQX (3 & 6 mg/kg) significantly decreased operant responding and correspondingly decreased the breaking point in responding for ethanol on a progressive ratio schedule. NBQX (but not GYKI 52466) also significantly decreased operant responding for a food reinforcer (sucrose) as well as for a sweet tasting reinforcer (saccharin). Doses of NBQX that disrupted operant performance caused a significant reduction in locomotor activity, indicating that NBQX decreased ethanol self-administration only at doses which disrupt motor activity.", 
    "102": "These results suggest non-NMDA glutamate-receptors may not have a specific role in the maintenance of responding for an ethanol reinforcer, but may generally disrupt operant performance. Because, unlike GYKI 52466, NBQX possesses an action at central kainate receptors, these results suggest that kainate, but not AMPA (alpha-amino 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors may be important in mediating the reinforcing effects of ethanol.", 
    "103": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that was approved for use in the United States in 1996. While it is a widely used medication in adults, there has been minimal investigation into its effect on children. We present the case of an 18-month-old boy who ingested 30-40 mg of olanzapine, which resulted in significant symptoms, including respiratory distress and mental status changes. Previously reported pediatric cases of olanzapine ingestion have described similar symptoms. Therefore, the pediatric population should be monitored closely when ingestions of olanzapine occur.", 
    "104": "As part of systematic treatment trials of haloperidol, clozapine, and olanzapine with a total of 35 children and adolescents with early onset psychosis, prolactin was measured at baseline and week 6 of treatment. The National Institute of Mental Health patients--13 females, 22 males (mean age, 14.1+/-2.3 years; range, 9.1-19 years) with childhood onset schizophrenia (n = 32), or Psychotic Disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 3) with onset of psychosis before age 13--were recruited for open or double-blind trials of haloperidol, clozapine, or olanzapine. Baseline serum prolactin was measured after a 3-week washout period and after 6 weeks of treatment. Mean prolactin concentration after 6 weeks of treatment was significantly elevated on all three drugs; however, on clozapine, mean prolactin remained within the normal range. Prolactin was increased above the upper limit of normal for 100% of 10 patients on haloperidol, 70% of 10 patients on olanzapine, and 0% of 15 patients on clozapine (chi2 analyses: H > C, p = 0.004; O > C, p = 0.001). Given the potential endocrine and possible cardiac correlates of hyperprolactinemia, these more robust prolactin elevations in pediatric patients after short-term exposure to olanzapine than those reported for adults justify longer observation intervals with bigger samples to establish treatment safety of atypical antipsychotics in adolescents.",

    "107": "On each of three separate visits, patients performed a computerised test battery to determine baseline cognitive performance. Then, following administration of either midazolam, nitrous oxide, or no drug, patients re-performed the test battery. Finally, patients completed visual analogue scales assessing their subjective mood state.", 
    "108": "Relative to baseline performance, midazolam administration produced significantly slower reaction times compared with nitrous oxide and no-drug conditions. Furthermore, patients receiving midazolam were impaired in accuracy relative to the other conditions on many of the cognitive tasks, particularly those assessing the recall of information. Patient performance in nitrous oxide and control conditions did not significantly differ. These results could not be explained by differences in mood between the conditions, as subjective mood ratings during midazolam or nitrous oxide administration were very similar.", 
    "109": "It is important for clinicians to be aware that peri-operative recall of information is reduced in patients who have undergone midazolam sedation. This is an advantage for patients who are anxious, and do not wish to be aware of the operative treatment being performed. However, as the cognitive impairment is enduring, an adult escort and written post-operative instructions should be mandatory for midazolam sedation patients. In contrast, the use of nitrous oxide sedation does not significantly impair higher cognitive tasks and thus patients receiving nitrous oxide sedation can resume normal activities in the post-operative period.", 
    "110": "The anxiolytic effects of the neuroactive steroid, 3 alpha-OH-5 beta-pregnan-20-one (pregnanolone), were determined after injection into the dorsal hippocampus or lateral septum in adult male rats. An increase in the proportion of time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze was found after 2.5 and 5 micrograms of pregnanolone in the hippocampus, but not in the lateral septum. Intrahippocampal injection of 2.5 micrograms of the 3 beta-epimer of pregnanolone did not affect behavior in the plus-maze; a higher dose of 5 micrograms produced an anxiogenic effect. In the shock-probe burying test latency to burying behavior was increased by intrahippocampal or intraseptal injection of 2.5 and 5 micrograms of pregnanolone; the duration of burying behavior was decreased by 0.5, 2.5 and 5 micrograms of pregnanolone injection in the dorsal hippocampus or lateral septum. The number of contacts with the shock probe was not affected by any dose of pregnanolone in either intracranial site of injection. The anxiolytic effects of intrahippocampal or intraseptal injection of pregnanolone were blocked by intracranial pretreatment with 20 ng of picrotoxin, but not by microinjection of 5 micrograms of flumazenil or 200 ng of PK 11195. Thus, inhibition of the hippocampus, mediated by the pregnanolone's action at the GABAA receptor, produces a general anxiolytic effect. However, similar inhibition in the lateral septum attenuates active avoidance of anxiogenic stimuli (i.e., decreased burying behavior), but not passive avoidance of aversive stimuli (i.e., exploration of open arms of the plus-maze and number of shocks in the probe burying test).", 
    "111": "Effects of protein kinase C (PKC) activation on the function of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride complex were analyzed by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]TBPS in rat brain slices. The density of [3H]muscimol binding was highest in cerebellar granular layers and high in both the frontal cortex and thalamus, but binding levels in the hippocampus were low. After activation of PKC by 100 nM phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), [3H]muscimol binding was decreased in the frontal cortex, striatum and thalamus, but binding levels were not changed in the hippocampus or cerebellum. The density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was high in the cortex, hippocampus and molecular layers of cerebellum but was low in thalamus. PDBu increased the [3H]flunitrazepam binding only in the striatum and in part of the cortex and thalamus after activation of PKC. After activation of PKC by PDBu [35S]TBPS binding was increased in most areas, but binding levels were not changed in the brainstem or cerebellum. The receptor binding was markedly decreased in almost all areas by the addition of 2.5 mM Mg2+. Elevated [35S]TBPS binding produced by PDBu was significantly inhibited by the addition of Mg2+. These results suggest that the activation of PKC potentiates benzodiazepine and TBPS binding, but decreases muscimol binding in a region-specific manner in the rat brain.", 
    "112": "Epilepsy affects 1.2% to 4.4% of the general population. Given the clinical profile of the newer antiepileptic agents, it is likely their usage will increase in the coming years, thus increasing the emergency physician's exposure to these medications and their side effects. Several of these side effects can have high morbidity, such as the aplastic anemia and hepatotoxicity caused by felbamate, and the Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with lamotrigine. Overdoses of these medications also could increase, as will our knowledge of recognizing and managing them. The clinical spectrum of the newer medications is the treatment of partial seizures. None of the newer medications can be orally loaded nor are they available in an i.v. preparation. Serum drug levels are not available in most institutions and are not routinely measured in the ED. The new preparations of phenytoin, diazepam, and valporic acid add increased efficiency in drug administration, providing a new method for prehospital treatment of seizures and a more tolerable means of administration in the ED.", 
    "113": "We describe the use of Bayesian regularized artificial neural networks (BRANNs) coupled with automatic relevance determination (ARD) in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. These BRANN-ARD networks have the potential to solve a number of problems which arise in QSAR modeling such as the following: choice of model; robustness of model; choice of validation set; size of validation effort; and optimization of network architecture. The ARD method ensures that irrelevant or highly correlated indices used in the modeling are neglected as well as showing which are the most important variables in modeling the activity data. The application of the methods to QSAR of compounds active at the benzodiazepine and muscarinic receptors as well as some toxicological data of the effect of substituted benzenes on Tetetrahymena pyriformis is illustrated.", 
    "114": "The death of a 36-year-old alcoholic man who died after developing seizure activity while being treated with tramadol, as well as with venlafaxine, trazodone, and quetiapine, all of which interact with the neurotransmitter serotonin, is reported. The decedent, who had a history of chronic back pain, alcoholism, depression, mild hypertensive cardiovascular disease, and gastritis, had just been discharged from the hospital after 4 days of alcohol detoxification treatment. During the admission, no withdrawal seizures were noted. The morning after discharge, a witness observed the decedent exhibiting seizure activity and then collapsing. An autopsy was performed approximately 6 hours after death, and the anatomic findings were consistent with seizure activity and collapse, which included biting injuries of the tongue and soft-tissue injuries of the face. Toxicologic analysis identified tramadol, venlafaxine, promethazine, and acetaminophen in the urine; tramadol (0.70 mg/L) and venlafaxine (0.30 mg/L) in the heart blood, and 0.10 mg of tramadol in 40 ml of submitted stomach contents. No metabolites, such as acetate, acetone, lactate, and pyruvate, were found in the specimens that would be characteristically found in a person with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The threshold for seizures is lowered by tramadol. In addition, the risk for seizure is enhanced by the concomitant use of tramadol with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or neuroleptics, and its use in patients with a recognized risk for seizures, i.e., alcohol withdrawal. The cause of death in this individual was seizure activity complicating therapy for back pain, depression, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The data in Adverse Event Reporting System of the Food and Drug Administration from November 1, 1997 to September 8, 1999 was reviewed along with a MEDLINE search from 1966 to the present. This case appears to be the first reported death caused by seizure activity in a patient taking tramadol in combination with drugs that affect serotonin.", 
    "115": "Two selective radioligands of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors containing the alpha5 subunit, [3H]L655,708 and [3H]RY80, were evaluated in rats as potential in vivo tracers for positron emission tomography (PET). Brain uptake index (BUI), a measure of first pass extraction, was moderate for [3H]L655,708 (BUI of 59%) and good for [3H]RY80 (BUI of 96%). This finding was consistent with their in vitro binding to plasma proteins of approximately 76% and 50%, respectively. Following intravenous injection of either radioligand, radioactivity in plasma was measured and uptake characteristics were assessed in brain within a time period relevant to PET scanning (up to 90 min). Discrete brain regions, such as frontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, colliculi, medulla, and cerebellum, were sampled and the temporal distribution of radioactivity analysed. Despite the reasonable delivery to the brain, neither of the radioligands had sufficient retention in the tissues rich in alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors to achieve a good selective signal. For both radioligands, a maximal tissue:cerebellum ratio of 1.5 was seen in hippocampus at 10 min after injection. Thus, neither of the compounds studied shows potential for further development as an in vivo PET ligand.",

    "124": "Nocturnal sleepiness is a common complaint suffered by night-shift workers, especially in conditions of an abrupt shift of the wake-sleep cycle. Alertness management strategies can minimize the adverse effects of sleep loss and circadian rhythm desynchronization and promote optimal vigilance in operational settings. Within these strategies. one possibility is to use short periods of \"prophylactic sleep\" (before long periods of work), which can be facilitated by hypnotics. Vigilance can be evaluated by means of several tests which, sometimes, imply procedures and devices not easily employable in operational settings. In such conditions pencil and paper tests of vigilance can be very useful in the assessment of attentional performance degradation due to sleep loss and/or inversion of the sleep-wake cycle. In this study we evaluated the sensitivity of a three-Letter Cancellation Task (3-LCT) in revealing nighttime variations of vigilance in a laboratory simulation of acute night shift, after a diurnal sleep with placebo (PLC) or temazepam (TMZ). Nocturnal levels of vigilance were also assessed using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). All tests were administered four times at 2-h intervals during nighttime after a daytime sleep. Results show that the 3-LCT is sensitive to variations of vigilance occurring during a laboratory simulation of acute night shift. We also found some effects of TMZ, which in the first nocturnal session caused a slowing down of visuoattentive performance. Nocturnal variations of vigilance detected through the 3-LCT were similar to those revealed by means of MSLT, while the ability to maintain wakefulness was substantially spared during the night.",

Patients in the midazolam group received 2 mg midazolam im 30 min before arrival at the operation room. After spinal anesthesia was instituted with intrathecal injection of hyperbaric tetracaine, we provided sedation using continuous infusion of propofol. The level of sedation was controlled at a level between \"eyes closed but rousable to command\" and \"eyes closed but rousable to mild physical stimulation\" by adjusting the infusion rate. During sedation, the propofol requirements and complications were recorded and patients were asked, two hours after the end of operation, whether they remembered intraoperative events.",

    "129": "Consistent with its putative anxiogenic actions, administration of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist FG 7142 has been shown to potentiate defensive-like cardiovascular reactivity to an acoustic stimulus in the rat, an effect that appears to be mediated by the basal forebrain cholinergic system. The present studies tested the hypothesis that the basal forebrain cholinergic projections to the medial prefrontal cortex, an area that has been implicated in both anxiety and autonomic control, may be a relevant pathway underlying this response potentiation. Infusions of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol into the medial prefrontal cortex, but not into the lateral prefrontal cortex or the basolateral amygdala, mimicked the effects of systemically administered FG 7142 on the cardioacceleratory response. Infusions of the muscarinic antagonist atropine blocked this effect, as well as the response-potentiating actions of FG 7142. The effects of FG 7142 were also blocked by lesions of the cholinergic inputs to the medial prefrontal cortex produced by local infusions of the immunotoxin 192 immunoglobulin G-saporin into this area. These findings indicate that cholinergic activation of the medial prefrontal cortex is sufficient to enhance the cardioacceleratory defensive response, and that cholinergic inputs to the medial prefrontal cortex are necessary for the response-potentiating effects of FG 7142. These results are consistent with a recent neurobiological model of anxiety and autonomic control that attributes the enhanced processing of anxiety-related stimuli and contexts to increases in activity in cortical cholinergic inputs.", 
    "130": "The tubercles of Anredera leptostachys are used as an antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory in the popular medicine of the Caribbean basin. In the present work, the anti-nociceptive and central nervous system depressant (CNS) effects of the methanolic extract from the tubercles of A. leptostachys have been evaluated. The antinociceptive activity was assayed in several experimental models in mice: acetic acid, formalin and hot plate tests. The methanolic extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) significantly and in a dose-dependent manner reduced the nociception induced by the acetic acid (P < 0.001). In the hot plate test, the extract significantly increased the latency time of jump although it slightly increased the licking time. The naloxone partially reversed the antinociception of the extract in the hot plate test. In the formalin test, the methanolic extract also significantly reduced the painful stimulus but the effect was not dose-dependent. In the study of the CNS-depressant effects, the extract was found to produce a significant reduction of the exploratory capacity with both doses assayed (P < 0.001). The muscular relaxation only decreased with the higher doses assayed (P < 0.001). The escape instinct was also significantly reduced (P < 0.001) by the two doses of the extract and both were more effective than standard drugs morphine and diazepam.",

These animals also gained significantly more weight than the animals only receiving kainic acid, whereas their weight gain did not differed significantly from controls. Equivalent results were found when the neuronal damage in the hippocampus was evaluated through changes in peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (microglial marker) and heat shock protein 27 kD expression (astroglial marker). Our results are consistent with the oxygen radical scavenging properties of C-phycocyanin described elsewhere. Our findings and the virtual lack of toxicity of C-phycocyanin suggest this drug could be used to treat oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.", 
    "132": "Rhabdomyolysis is a common cause of acute renal failure (ARF) associated with drug misuse. Abuse of the gel formulation of temazepam has been a particular problem in the West of Scotland. We performed a retrospective review of dialysis-dependent ARF from rhabdomyolysis and drug misuse in the West of Scotland, 1986-1997. We identified 76 patients, of whom 87% were male. Seventeen cases occurred in the first 6 years, compared with 59 in the subsequent 6 years. Median age was 32. Thirty cases followed intravenous drug misuse, 46 followed oral drug misuse. The substances most frequently misused were alcohol (54%), heroin (24%) and parenteral temazepam (17%). The temazepam cases all followed the introduction of the gel formulation. Three out of 4 patients requiring limb amputation had injected temazepam. Of intravenous drug misusers tested, 72% were hepatitis-C-positive. Some 43% of patients had deprivation scores in the worst category. ARF due to rhabdomyolysis from substance misuse is increasing in our area. Alcohol is frequently responsible. The introduction of the gel formulation of temazepam has contributed to the increase. Those at risk in this study were young, male, had a high incidence of hepatitis C and lived in the most deprived areas.",

    "134": "The influence of pH, ionic strength and the concentration of albumin in the adsorption medium as well as the charge and lipophilicity of a model drug on their adsorption onto poly(acrylic acid) grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PAA-PVDF) membranes was evaluated. The PAA-PVDF membrane is a responsive porous polymer membrane that we have studied for controlled drug delivery. Sodium salicylate (anionic), flunitrazepam (neutral), primidone (neutral), desipramine (cationic) and thioridazine (cationic) were used as model drugs. The extent of drug adsorption was dependent on pH. Drug adsorption was enhanced by the dissociation of the grafted PAA chains and by a positive charge and a high lipophilicity of the drug. Increasing the ionic strength of the medium retarded the adsorption of the cationic drugs. Interestingly, the present results showing that drugs are adsorbed onto the membrane while albumin is not adsorbed onto the membrane suggest that the PAA-PVDF membrane may be suitable for separating drugs from proteinaceous substances for subsequent monitoring and evaluation.",

Each U.S. program belonging to the Association of Air Medical Services was contacted by telephone, and a flight nurse or paramedic provided answers based on personal experience and statistics compiled by his or her individual program.", 
    "137": "Of the 100 programs responding, benzodiazepines were used most commonly to control agitation with 51% using micazolam. Patients with a head injury required CR more frequently than any other condition (73%). Crews flying larger aircraft reported less need for CR. A physician order was required by only 30% of the programs, but delays infrequently endangered the patient (2%). Only 7% of the responding programs had a patient whose condition deteriorated because of CR.", 
    "138": "CR is necessary in air medical transport. Most programs use short-acting benzodiazepines. Crews in smaller aircraft use CR more frequently, and head injury is the most common condition requiring such restraint.", 
    "139": "More than half of the out-patients in Japanese hospitals receive anxiolytics or hypnotics for basic symptomatic management. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are the most frequently prescribed by psychiatrists and by internists for the treatment of anxiety symptoms (mainly generalised anxiety disorder, psychosomatic diseases and autonomic dystonia). Although numerous BZDs and their analogues were introduced into the Japanese market during the last three decades, thienodiazepine derivatives have the predominant market share, in contrast to the US and the UK. Approved doses are also lower. The lack of buspirone and SSRIs in the market may contribute to the widespread prescription of BZDs in Japan. Several newer anxiolytic candidates, such as BZD receptor partial agonists and 5-HT1A receptor agonists, are currently in various phases of clinical research in Japan. However, the designs of clinical trials, particularly diagnostic precision, need to be revised.", 
    "140": "Benzodiazepines have come under scrutiny and attack over recent years because of their abuse liability, withdrawal reactions and development of tolerance. Consequently, practitioners worldwide are discouraged from prescribing them. While some of these risks may have been exaggerated, benzodiazepines remain a useful therapeutic tool, alone or in combination, in a number of psychiatric and medical conditions. Withholding such treatment may be unjustified and detrimental to the patients' health. Further, benzodiazepines have helped researchers in their attempts to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying anxiety. This, in return, leads to the development of new effective anxiolytic treatments, with fewer problems compared to the traditional benzodiazepine compounds. Such new agents are already available or at the closing stages of clinical trials.", 
    "141": "The benzodiazepines are still extensively used in psychiatry, neurology and medicine in general. Anxiety disorder and severe insomnia are important syndromal indications, but these drugs are widely prescribed at the symptomatic level, resulting in potential overuse. The official data sheets recommend short durations of usage and conservative dosage. Although short-term efficacy is established, long-term efficacy remains controversial, as relevant data are scanty and relapse, rebound and dependence on withdrawal not clearly distinguished. The risks of the benzodiazepines are well-documented and comprise psychological and physical effects. Among the former are subjective sedation, paradoxical release of anxiety and/or hostility, psychomotor impairment, memory disruption, and risks of accidents. Physical effects include vertigo, dysarthria, ataxia with falls, especially in the elderly. Dependence can supervene on long-term use, occasionally with dose escalation. The benzodiazepines are now recognised as major drugs of abuse and addiction. Other drug and non-drug therapies are available and have a superior risk benefit ratio in long-term use. It is concluded that benzodiazepines should be reserved for short-term use--up to 4 weeks--and in conservative dosage.", 
    "142": "A follow-up survey in 1997 to a 1992 study of the recommendations of an international expert panel on the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and other psychotherapeutic medications in the treatment of anxiety disorders suggests that the BZDs remain a mainstay of pharmacotherapy for most of these conditions. BZDs were mentioned more often than any other class of drugs as preferred first-line therapy for anxiety disorders, except obsessive compulsive disorder. The introduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) did not significantly affect the experts' recommendations for the use of BZDs as first-line pharmacotherapy. Rather, the SSRIs displaced the tricyclic antidepressants. Some implications of the continuing recommendations for the use of BZDs in anxiety disorders are discussed.", 
    "143": "In view of interest in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), based on FOS protein accumulation during sleep as well as its output pathways to areas involved in sleep regulation, we have examined the effects of microinjections of triazolam into the VLPO. It was found that two doses of triazolam, noted previously to enhance sleep when injected into the medial preoptic area, had no significant effect on sleep or core temperature when administered into the VLPO. Although these data do not bear on the possibility that the VLPO is involved in physiological sleep regulation, they suggest that it is not a site of the pharmacologic action of hypnotic benzodiazepines.", 
    "144": "The action of propofol on the rat locus coeruleus was examined using intracellular recording from in vitro brain slice preparations. Concentrations of propofol between 3 and 300 microM were tested. At 100 microM, propofol completely inhibited the firing of all neurons tested (n=34); this was associated with a 5.7-mV hyperpolarization (range 0-16 mV, n=33) and a 35.6% reduction in input resistance (range 7.3-66.1%, n=33). The propofol-induced responses were not affected by 2-hydroxysaclofen (50 microM) or BaCl(2) (300 microM), but were completely blocked by bicuculline methiodide (100 microM) or picrotoxin (100 microM), indicating that propofol acts on GABA(A) receptors. As assessed by inhibition of the spontaneous firing rate, propofol was 5.6-fold more potent than GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). Potentiation of the propofol effect by other general anesthetics or other drugs was also investigated. When pentobarbital (100 microM) was tested alone on locus coeruleus cells, no change in membrane potential or input resistance was seen and there was only a 20.3+/-7.2% (n=8) inhibition of firing rate; however, in combination with 30 microM propofol, it caused a 6.1-fold greater increase in membrane hyperpolarization and a 9.7-fold greater reduction in input resistance than 30 microM propofol alone. A relatively low concentration of alphaxalone (10 microM), when tested alone, had little effect on the membrane potential or input resistance and only produced a 46.0+/-8.9% (n=8) inhibition of firing rate; however, in combination with 30 microM propofol, it caused a 9.3-fold greater hyperpolarization and an 8.6-fold greater reduction in input resistance compared with 30 microM propofol alone. In contrast, diazepam caused no potentiation of either propofol- or GABA-induced responses. Our data also indicate that locus coeruleus neuron GABA(A) receptors possess distinctive pharmacologic characteristics, such as blocking of the propofol effects by zinc and insensitivity to diazepam and the direct action of pentobarbital. On the basis of these pharmacologic properties, we suggest that locus coeruleus neuron GABA(A) receptors do not contain the gamma subunit.", 
    "145": "Prior studies demonstrate that NMDA receptor antagonists attenuate cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. Since glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter for NMDA receptors, pharmacological interventions to lower glutamatergic activity through non-NMDA ionotropic receptor-mediated mechanisms were evaluated for their ability to prevent the convulsive and lethal effects of cocaine. Pre-treatment of male, Swiss Webster mice with the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonists 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2, 3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX; 10-80 mg/kg, i.p.) or 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466; 10-20 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to significantly attenuate cocaine-induced convulsions or lethality. Although ineffective when administered alone, NBQX enhanced the protective effects of 5-nitro-6,7-dichloro-1, 4-dihydro-2,3-quinoxalinedione (ACEA-1021), an NMDA/glycine site antagonist, when administered in combination. The mixed NMDA/non-NMDA receptor competitive antagonist 5-chloro-7-trifluoromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (ACEA-1011) also protected against the convulsive effects of cocaine. The data suggest that AMPA/kainate receptors indirectly influence the pathophysiological changes that occur after a cocaine overdose through modulation of NMDA receptors.", 
    "146": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) are the terms used interchangeably to describe a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with acute or chronic hepatocellular failure, increased portal systemic shunting of blood, or both. Hepatic encephalopathy complicating acute liver failure is referred to as fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). The clinical manifestations of HE or PSE range from minimal changes in personality and motor activity, to overt deterioration of intellectual function, decreased consciousness and coma, and appear to reflect primarily a variable imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Pathogenic mechanisms that may be responsible for HE have been extensively investigated using animal models of HE, or cultures of CNS cells treated with neuroactive substances that have been implicated in HE. Of the many compounds that accumulate in the circulation as a consequence of impaired liver function, ammonia is considered to play an important role in the onset of HE. Acute ammonia neurotoxicity, which may be a cause of seizures in FHF, is excitotoxic in nature, being associated with increased synaptic release of glutamate (Glu), the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the brain, and subsequent overactivation of the ionotropic Glu receptors, mainly the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Hepatic encephalopathy complicating chronic liver failure appears to be associated with a shift in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission towards a net increase of inhibitory neurotransmission, as a consequence of at least two factors. The first is down-regulation of Glu receptors resulting in decreased glutamatergic tone. The down-regulation follows excessive extrasynaptic accumulation of Glu resulting from its impaired re-uptake into nerve endings and astrocytes. Liver failure inactivates the Glu transporter GLT-1 in astrocytes. The second factor is an increase in inhibitory neurotransmission by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) due to (a) increased brain levels of natural benzodiazepines; (b) increased availability of GABA at GABA-A receptors, due to enhanced synaptic release of the amino acid; (c) direct interaction of modestly increased levels of ammonia with the GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptor complex; and (d) ammonia-induced up-regulation of astrocytic peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBZR). Brain ammonia is metabolised in astrocytes to glutamine (Gln), an osmolyte, and increased Gln accumulation in these cells may contribute to cytotoxic brain edema, which often complicates FHF. Glutamine efflux from the brain is an event that facilitates plasma-to-brain transport of aromatic amino acids. Tryptophan and tyrosine are direct precursors of the aminergic inhibitory neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine, respectively. Changes in serotonin and dopamine and their receptors may contribute to some of the motor manifestations of HE. Finally, oxindole, a recently discovered tryptophan metabolite with strong sedative and hypotensive properties, has been shown to accumulate in cirrhotic patients and animal models of HE.", 
    "147": "The aim of this paper is to survey patterns of use of new generation and conventional antipsychosis and adjunctive drugs by an inner urban community psychiatric service.", 
    "148": "All prescriptions for antipsychosis medications and all patients receiving these drugs in May 1998 were identified. Case record review yielded demographic and diagnostic data. Information was also obtained directly from prescribers.", 
    "149": "Of 859 patients, 77% received antipsychosis medication; 53% of prescriptions for antipsychotics were for new generation drugs: risperidone (42%), olanzapine (37%) and clozapine (21%). Mean doses were 4.1+/-2.5 mg (risperidone), 14.7+/-8.2 mg (olanzapine) and 377.4+/-178.9 mg (clozapine). Doses for men tended to be higher than those for women, but the differences were not significant. DSM-IV diagnosis was schizophrenia for 74% of patients on atypicals, but patients with other diagnoses were also being treated with these drugs. Risperidone was more commonly used in combination with benzodiazepines and anticholinergics than olanzapine and clozapine, while clozapine was less likely to be combined with antidepressants and mood stabilisers. Of the conventionals, 66% were in depot form, mostly because of non-compliance. Combinations of antipsychotics were prescribed to 13% of patients.", 
    "150": "New generation antipsychosis medications were prescribed more commonly than conventional drugs in this service for a wide range of diagnoses. Adjunctive medications were commonly utilised. These findings underline the clinical complexity of antipsychotic treatment in a changing environment."
