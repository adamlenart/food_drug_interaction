An oral fluid sample was obtained and analysed for illicit substance use by a point-of-care testing device (Dr\u00e4ger Drugtest\u00ae 5000). Patients who tested positive by self reporting or oral fluid testing underwent confirmatory blood testing (n=117).", 
    "2": "Self reporting revealed more overall illicit substance use and more users of cannabinoids, amphetamines, opioids, cocaine and benzodiazepines than oral fluid testing. Self reporting was more sensitive than blood testing for the detection of overall illicit substance use, and for use of cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.",

    "9": "Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES)/continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS) is an age-related, self-limiting disorder characterised by epilepsy with different seizure types, global or selective neuropsychological regression, motor impairment, and a typical EEG pattern of continuous epileptiform activity for more than 85% of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Although the first description of ESES/CSWS dates back to 1971, an agreement about the optimal treatment for this condition is still lacking. ESES/CSWS is rare (incidence is 0.2-0.5% of all childhood epilepsies) and no controlled clinical trials have been conducted to establish the efficacy of different antiepileptic drugs; only uncontrolled studies and case reports are reported in the literature. Treatment options for ESES/CSWS include some antiepileptic drugs (valproic acid, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, and benzodiazepines), steroids, immunoglobulins, the ketogenic diet, and surgery (multiple subpial transections). In this study, the comparative value of each of these treatments is reviewed and a personal therapeutic approach is proposed.", 
    "10": "The withdrawal syndrome from benzodiazepine (BZD) can be severe and in some cases may impede cessation of the use of the drug. We present here a case series of benzodiazepine detoxification by flumazenil infusion, stabilised with clonazepam. Patients were treated with flumazenil 1.35 mg/day for a median of 7 days. Self-reported physical withdrawal symptoms were recorded daily. In addition to flumazenil, antidepressants were given before treatment commenced and clonazepam was administered nightly with both being continued after discharge. Twenty-nine patients were treated. No patients dropped out from the treatment programme. Nine patients (31%) required a temporary reduction/cessation of the infusion. The linear trend in the reduction of the daily withdrawal scores in the overall study population was significant. The linear trends were also significant in the group of patients for whom a temporary reduction/suspension of the flumazenil was required. Six months after treatment, 15 patients (53%) were abstinent from clonazepam and other BZDs. For five (21%) the BZD dependence were reinstated. More than two-thirds of the subjects tolerated the procedure well and about half had a good long term response. Slow flumazenil infusion appears to merit consideration as a possible future treatment. Suggestions for future research are examined.",

Fifteen patients reported that onset of headache occurred prior to onset of substance use, while 94.5% had headaches occurred after substance abuse. A higher incidence of headache was found in the benzodiazepine, methylamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, volatile solvent abusers. Seventy-eight percent of headache patients have never sought help from a physician despite the severity and frequency of headache.", 
    "14": "In our study, the prevalence of headache among all psychoactive substance abusers was 26.9%. Although this is one-group study without any comparison with non-addict population and associational data must be interpreted with caution, the results of this study indicate a possible relationship may exist between headache and substance use since 94.5% of substance users described headaches after the onset of substance use. The younger start and the longer duration of cannabis use caused the higher incidence of headache, but this correlation was not observed in other substance use. Migraine was far more prevalent in the abusers than in previously reported community populations.",

    "17": "Approved doses of zolpidem (10 mg for adults, 5 mg for the elderly) are consistently effective in reducing sleep latency and consequently increasing sleep duration in patients with insomnia. However, favorable effects on sleep maintenance are observed less consistently. Residual daytime effects are unlikely with recommended doses, and provided that at least 8 h elapse prior to arising. Hypnotic efficacy is maintained with repeated nightly use, and the risk of rebound insomnia is low. Dependence and abuse of zolpidem are no more likely to occur than with typical benzodiazepines. Newly available novel dosage forms of zolpidem have increased therapeutic options for patients with insomnia variants such as sleep maintenance insomnia and middle-of-the-night awakening.",

Using mathematical algorithms, the 3-dimensional (3D) distribution of the electrical potential inside the brain can be calculated. One of the methods to calculate it is the low-resolution electrical tomographic analysis (LORETA). In this research, we seek to find the brain structures that differentiate patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from controls. Ten right-handed consenting adult male patients were recruited from a PTSD clinic. All patients fulfilled Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR]) criteria for chronic PTSD (duration >2 years.) and were on drug treatment regimens that had been stable for at least 2 months (involving only serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and benzodiazepines).The control group consisted of 10 healthy hospital staff members. All study participants underwent 19 channel EEG measurements according to current standards of practice. All artifact-free EEG strips were examined for spectral as well as LORETA analysis focusing on the theta (4-7 Hz) band which is suggested to reflect the activity of the limbic system. The theta band showed a statistically significant difference (P < .05) between the 2 groups in the right temporal lobe and in both the right and left frontal lobes. Our findings support existing research data obtained via other imaging technologies, which demonstrated structural alterations in the right temporal and frontal areas in PTSD. These results indicate that combining quantitative EEG (QEEG) and the LORETA method, among other methods, may improve the neuroanatomical resolution of EEG data analysis.",

The CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole increased AUC(0-\u221e) and C(max) of N-CLB by 36% and 15%, respectively, but did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. At steady state, N-CLB has 3-4 times greater exposure than clobazam. In the second DDI study, no clinically significant drug-drug interactions were observed between clobazam 40\u00a0mg and the CYP probe substrates caffeine or tolbutamide. Exposure to midazolam and its 1-hydroxymidazolam metabolite, however, decreased by 27% and increased 4-fold, respectively. Clobazam increased dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) AUC(0-\u221e) by 95% and C(max) by 59%. In the population pharmacokinetics analysis, stable dosages of common antiepileptic drugs that induce CYP3A4 or CYP2C19, or inhibit CYP2C19, had negligible effects on clobazam or N-CLB. Clobazam did not affect valproic acid or lamotrigine exposures.",

Concomitant use of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may require dosage adjustment. Clobazam may be administered safely as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, without meaningful changes in clobazam pharmacokinetics that would require dosage adjustment.", 
    "27": "We describe the case of a 17-year-old girl with anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis. She had the characteristic psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, delirious and bizarre behaviour, and catatonic symptoms. She later also displayed neurological symptoms such as epileptic seizures, dyskinesias and sensitivity disturbances. After treatment with corticosteroids and immunoglobulins patient recovered completely. Potentially lethal symptoms can arise from the autonomic dysregulation. The incidence of this disorder has not yet been established. The catatonic features should be treated adequately with high doses of benzodiazepines. Because patients usually present with psychiatric symptoms, treatment often starts in a psychiatric setting. In view of the serious somatic complications it is desirable that the patient be treated in a general hospital. Early diagnosis and treatment are very important because the chances of recovery are thereby enhanced.",

Patients in the intervention group had music of their choice played via headphones during the procedure. The primary outcomes were reductions in the doses of drugs for sedation (midazolam) and analgesia (fentanyl). Anxiety levels were assessed both before and after the procedure using the validated State Anxiety Inventory. Mean pulse rate and average of mean blood pressures were also recorded before and during the procedures as surrogate indicators of anxiety levels.", 
    "30": "100 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio. There were 58 males and 42 females, with a mean age of 58 years. Sedation was required in 21 (42%) patients in the music group compared with 30 (60%) patients in the control group (p=0.046). The mean [standard deviation (SD)] midazolam dose was 2.1 mg (2.3 mg) in the control group and 1.3 mg (2.2 mg) in the music group (p=0.027). The mean (SD) fentanyl dose was 29 mg (40 mg) in the control group and 18 mg (34 mg) in the music group (p=0.055).

    "32": "The antipsychotic cyamemazine is a potent serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2AR)) antagonist. A positron emission tomography (PET) study in human patients showed that therapeutic doses of cyamemazine produced near saturation of 5-HT(2AR) occupancy in the frontal cortex, whereas dopamine D(2) occupancy remained below the level for motor side effects observed with typical antipsychotics. Recently, numerous studies have revealed the involvement of 5-HT(2AR) in the pathophysiology of anxiety and a double-blind, randomized clinical trial showed similar efficacy of cyamemazine and bromazepam in reducing the anxiety associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Therefore, we reviewed the above articles about 5-HT(2AR) and anxiety in order to understand better the anxiolytic mechanisms of cyamemazine in benzodiazepine withdrawal. The 5-HT(2AR) is the most abundant serotonin receptor subtype in the cortex. Non-pharmacological studies with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and genetically modified mice clearly showed that cortical 5-HT(2AR) signaling positively modulates anxiety-like behavior. With a few exceptions, most other studies reviewed here further support this view. Therefore, the anxiolytic efficacy of cyamemazine in benzodiazepine withdrawal can be due to a 5-HT(2AR) antagonistic activity at the cortical level.", 
    "33": "We examined whether augmentation with olanzapine would be superior to increased risperidone dose among acute schizophrenia patients showing early non-response to risperidone. We performed a rater-blinded, randomized controlled trial at psychiatric emergency sites. Eligible patients were newly admitted patients with acute schizophrenia. Early response was defined as Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale score \u22643 following 2 weeks of treatment. Early non-responders were allocated to receive either augmentation with olanzapine (RIS+OLZ group) or increased risperidone dose (RIS+RIS group). The 78 patients who completed 2 weeks of treatment were divided into 52 early responders to risperidone and 26 early non-responders to risperidone (RIS+OLZ group, n=13; RIS+RIS group, n=13). No difference in the achievement of \u226550% improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score was observed between RIS+OLZ and RIS+RIS groups. Although time to treatment discontinuation for any cause was significantly shorter in the RIS+RIS group (6.8 weeks [95% confidence interval, 5.2-8.4]) than in early responders to risperidone (8.6 weeks [7.9-9.3]; P=0.018), there was no significant difference between the RIS+OLZ group (7.9 weeks [6.3-9.5]) and early responders to risperidone. Secondary outcomes justify the inclusion of augmentation arms in additional, larger studies comparing strategies for early non-responders.", 
    "34": "Previous research suggests that the nonpeptide oxytocin receptor (OTR) agonist WAY 267,464 may only partly mimic the effects of oxytocin in rodents. The present study further explored these differences and related them to OTR and vasopressin 1a receptor (V(1a) R) pharmacology and regional patterns of c-Fos expression. Binding data for WAY 267,464 and oxytocin were obtained by displacement binding assays on cellular membranes, while functional receptor data were generated by luciferase reporter assays. For behavioural testing, adolescent rats were tested in a social preference paradigm, the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and for locomotor activity changes following WAY 267,464 (10 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) or oxytocin (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.). The higher doses were also examined for their effects on regional c-Fos expression. Results showed that WAY 267,464 had higher affinity (K(i) ) at the V(1a) R than the OTR (113 versus 978 nm). However, it had no functional response at the V(1a) R and only a weak functional effect (EC(50) ) at the OTR (881 nm). This suggests WAY 267,464 is an OTR agonist with weak affinity and a possible V(1a) R antagonist. Oxytocin showed high binding at the OTR (1.0 nm) and V(1a) R (503 nm), with a functional EC(50) of 9.0 and 59.7 nm, respectively, indicating it is a potent OTR agonist and full V(1a) R agonist. WAY 267,464 (100 mg/kg), but not oxytocin, significantly increased the proportion of time spent with a live rat, over a dummy rat, in the social preference test. Neither compound affected EPM behaviour, whereas the higher doses of WAY 267,464 and oxytocin suppressed locomotor activity. WAY 267,464 and oxytocin produced similar c-Fos expression in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central amygdala, lateral parabrachial nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract, suggesting a commonality of action at the OTR with the differential doses employed. However, WAY 267,464 caused greater c-Fos expression in the medial amygdala and the supraoptic nucleus than oxytocin, and lesser effects in the locus coeruleus. Overall, our results confirm the differential effects of WAY 267,464 and oxytocin and suggest that this may reflect contrasting actions of WAY 267,464 and oxytocin at the V(1a) R. Antagonism of the V(1a) R by WAY 267,464 could underlie some of the prosocial effects of this drug either through a direct action or through disinhibition of oxytocin circuitry that is subject to vasopressin inhibitory influences.",

Trials were grouped into placebo-controlled, dosage and head-to-head comparisons. Meta-analysis of the available data was possible for studies investigating oral midazolam vs placebo only. There is weak evidence from five small clinically heterogeneous trials at high risk of bias, that the use of oral midazolam in doses between 0.25 mg/kg to 0.75 mg/kg is associated with more co-operative behaviour compared to placebo; standardised mean difference (SMD) favoured midazolam (SMD 2.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 4.37, P < 0.001, I\u00b2 = 91%), which translates to an increase of approximately 1.8 points on the six-point Houpt behaviour scale.

    "51": "Phenazepam is a long acting benzodiazepine that is not controlled in Canada, the United States or many European countries. The abuse of phenazepam has gained recent attention due to the number of hospitalizations and fatalities resulting from overdose. The compound is relatively potent with recommended doses of 0.5-1.0 mg, or 1/10th the recommended dose of diazepam, and is easy to obtain locally or from international suppliers via the internet. Increased risk of phenazepam overdose is attributed to its potency and the forms in which it is supplied. Individuals without scales or balances are prone to estimate dose amounts of powder visually, which can result in significant errors. The detection of phenazepam has been described using various methods including GC, GC/MS and LC/MS, but no data regarding the sensitivity of commercially available immunoassays exist. In this study, phenazepam-spiked urine samples were analyzed using five commercial instruments and two point of care devices. The concentrations of phenazepam required for detection ranged from 140-462 ng/mL, which is comparable to those of other benzodiazepines. Laboratorians and clinicians should be confident that phenazepam will be detected via most commercial drugs of abuse screens in patients after significant ingestion.", 
    "52": "CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes. For several drugs, heteroactivation of CYP3A-mediated reactions has been demonstrated in vitro. In vivo data suggested a possible acute activation of CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam metabolism by efavirenz. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of efavirenz on the in vitro metabolism of midazolam. The formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam was studied in pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5) in the presence of efavirenz (0.5, 1, and 5 \u03bcM). Product formation rates (V(max)) increased with increasing efavirenz concentrations (\u223c1.5-fold increase at 5 \u03bcM efavirenz in HLM and \u223c1.4-fold in rCYP3A4). The activation in rCYP3A4 was dependent on cytochrome b5, and the activating effect was also observed in rCYP3A5 supplemented with cytochrome b5, where Vmax was \u223c1.3-fold enhanced. Concomitant inhibition of CYP3A activity with ketoconazole in HLM abolished the increase in the 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation rate, further confirming involvement of CYP3A. The results of this study represent a distinct acute activation of midazolam metabolism and support the in vivo observations. Moreover, only efavirenz, but not its major metabolite 8-hydroxyefavirenz, was responsible for the activation. The increase in 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation may have been caused by binding of efavirenz to a peripheral site of the enzyme, leading to enhanced midazolam turnover due to changes at the active site.",

For several weeks she had been treated for increasing vocal cord paresis of uncertain cause, requiring a tracheostomy, a speech cannula being inserted after eight days. Several days later the patient began to complain of dyspnea, but repeated inspection and cleaning of the cannula failed to reveal its cause. The increasingly anxious patient was given a benzodiazepine preparation to calm her. She was then transferred to the intensive care unit because of worsening respiratory insufficiency and impaired consciousness.", 
    "54": "A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed immediately, which revealed a black foreign body immediately distal to the tip of the tracheal cannula. The cannula was removed and the slightly sedated patient at once coughed up a large amount of bronchial secretion and a long, curved and fairly firm blood clot. Control bronchoscopy now revealed a flat, slightly hemorrhagic ulcer on the dorsal tracheal wall at the point where the cannula tip had made contact with the tracheal wall.",

However, the dimension of body weight change differs interindividually, and various genetic factors are considered to be associated with this effect.

In the global trend, there are strict regulations for the prescription of benzodiazepines, because of the risk of low-dose dependence. Benzodiazepines are recommended for the use only when necessary in the short term. In contrast, benzodiazepines have many clinical indications, compared with 5-HT1A receptor agonists.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of switching to aripiprazole on sexual dysfunction and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in male patients with schizophrenia. In this prospective, open-label study, the participants were 10 male schizophrenia patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, risperidone, amisulpride, and olanzapine. Before and after switching to aripiprazole, they were assessed on the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, and hormonal levels were measured. Our results showed a significant improvement in the severity of sexual dysfunction, especially in 'ease of sexual arousal' and 'penile erection,' as measured by the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale total scores after switching to aripiprazole (\u03c7(2) = 12.45 and P = 0.002). The serum prolactin level decreased significantly after switching to aripiprazole (\u03c7(2) = 11.14 and P = 0.004), but the changes in the total testosterone level were not significant (\u03c7(2) = 4.75 and P = 0.93). Our results suggest that sexual dysfunction in schizophrenia patients seems to improve after switching to aripiprazole from other atypical antipsychotics (risperiodone, amisulpride, or olanzapine). This may be associated with a change in dopamine and serotonin transmissions and a decrease in the serum prolactin concentration.", 
    "82": "Active Na+ absorption by alveolar ENaC is the main driving force of liquid clearance at birth and lung edema resorption in adulthood. We have demonstrated previously that long-term modulation of KvLQT1 and KATP K+ channel activities exerts sustained control in Na+ transport through the regulation of ENaC expression in primary alveolar type II (ATII) cells. The goal of the present study was: 1) to investigate the role of the alpha-ENaC promoter, transfected in the A549 alveolar cell line, in the regulation of ENaC expression by K+ channels, and 2) to determine the physiological impact of K+ channels and ENaC modulation on fluid clearance in ATII cells. KvLQT1 and KATP channels were first identified in A549 cells by PCR and Western blotting. We showed, for the first time, that KvLQT1 activation by R-L3 (applied for 24 h) increased alpha-ENaC expression, similarly to KATP activation by pinacidil. Conversely, pharmacological KvLQT1 and KATP inhibition or silencing with siRNAs down-regulated alpha-ENaC expression. Furthermore, K+ channel blockers significantly decreased alpha-ENaC promoter activity. Our results indicated that this decrease in promoter activity could be mediated, at least in part, by the repressor activity of ERK1/2. Conversely, KvLQT1 and KATP activation dose-dependently enhanced alpha-ENaC promoter activity. Finally, we noted a physiological impact of changes in K+ channel functions on ERK activity, alpha-, beta-, gamma-ENaC subunit expression and fluid absorption through polarized ATII cells. In summary, our results disclose that K+ channels regulate alpha-ENaC expression by controlling its promoter activity and thus affect the alveolar function of fluid clearance.", 
    "83": "Neuroactive steroid levels are decreased in the central nervous system (CNS) of streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats. In agreement, they exert protective effects in this experimental model, counteracting degenerative events occurring in the CNS. Therefore, an interesting therapeutic strategy could be to increase their levels directly in the CNS. In this study we have evaluated whether activation of translocator protein-18kDa (TSPO) or liver X receptors (LXRs) may affect the levels of neuroactive steroids present in the CNS of diabetic and non-diabetic animals. We observed that the treatment with either Ro5-4864 (i.e., a ligand of TSPO) or with GW3965 (i.e., a ligand of LXRs) induced an increase of neuroactive steroids in the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex of STZ-rats, but not in the CNS of non-pathological animals. Interestingly, the pattern of induction was different among the three CNS areas analyzed and between the two pharmacological tools. In particular, the activation of LXRs might represent a promising neuroprotective strategy, because the treatment with GW3965, at variance to Ro5-4864 treatment, did not induce significant changes in the plasma levels of neuroactive steroids. This suggests that activation of LXRs may selectively increase the CNS levels of neuroactive steroids avoiding possible endocrine side effects exerted by the systemic treatment with these molecules. Interestingly GW3965 treatment induced an increase of dihydroprogesterone in the spinal cord of diabetic animals in association with an increase of myelin basic protein expression. Thus we demonstrated that LXR activation was able to rescue CNS symptoms of diabetes.", 
    "84": "Methadone, a synthetic racemic opioid that primarily works as a \u03bc-opioid receptor (OPRM1) agonist, is commonly used for the treatment of heroin addiction. Genetic association studies have reported that the OPRM1 gene is involved in the physiology of heroin and alcohol addiction. Our current study is designed to test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the OPRM1 gene region are associated with methadone dosage, plasma concentrations, treatment responses, adverse reactions and withdrawal symptoms in a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) cohort from Taiwan. Fifteen OPRM1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped using DNA samples from 366 MMT patients. The plasma concentrations of methadone and its metabolite were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained using dominant model analysis indicate that the OPRM1 SNPs rs1074287, rs6912029, rs12209447, rs510769, rs3798676, rs7748401, rs495491, rs10457090, rs589046, rs3778152, rs563649, and rs2075572 are significantly associated with change-in-libido side effects (adjusted p<0.042). Using recessive model analysis, these SNPs were also found to be significantly associated with insomnia side effects in this cohort (p<0.009). The significance of the insomnia findings was mainly contributed by a subgroup of patients who had a positive urine morphine test (p<0.022), and by individuals who did not use benzodiazepine hypnotics (p<0.034). Our current data thus suggest that genetic polymorphisms in OPRM1 may influence the change-in-libido and insomnia side effects sometimes found in MMT patients.",

Intratracheal suctioning significantly increased RASS during both sedation (to -0.6 \u00b1 1.7) and sedation stop (to 1.0 \u00b1 1.5) (both P < 0.01), but not during analgesia. Systolic blood pressure increased during sedation (by 9\u2009\u00b1\u200910 mmHg), during sedation stop (by 15 \u00b1 17 mmHg) and during analgesia (by 9 \u00b1 4 mmHg; all P < 0.01), but diastolic pressure only during sedation and sedation stop (both P < 0.01).

Tetrahydropalmatine (THP), an active component isolated from the Chinese herbal plant Corydalis yanhusuo, is used in Asia for its analgesic, sedative, and hypnotic properties during herbal therapy. Fifty-five rats were assigned to 1 of 5 groups with 11 rats per group: 1) control (vehicle), 2) THP, 3) midazolam, 4) midazolam with THP, and 5) flumazenil with THP. In this study, the elevated plus-maze measured the behavioral components of anxiety and motor movements. The data were analyzed using a 2-tailed multivariate analysis of variance to determine if a significant difference existed followed by the least significant difference post hoc test. The findings suggest that THP, 25 mg/kg, given via intraperitoneal injection, results in significant anxiolysis and decreased motor movements. Furthermore, flumazenil, 3 mg/kg, does not fully antagonize the effects of THP.",

This was a continuation of our previous study conducted on the same cohort when the infants were 3\u2009months old. Psychotropics implicated included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and a benzodiazepine derivative anxiolytic (clonazepam). The three comparison groups were: control (n\u2009=\u200923; infants not exposed to psychotropics in utero), SSRI-alone (n\u2009=\u200922; infants exposed to SSRIs only and having mothers who had a primary diagnosis of depressive disorder without having comorbid anxiety disorder), and SSRI+ group (n\u2009=\u200915; infants gestationally exposed to SSRIs and clonazepam and having mothers that had both clinical depression and anxiety disorder). Using the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment Scale, infants were assessed in a dyadic context during free play and a structured task. There were significant differences in psychotropic exposed and non-exposed dyads regarding infant negative affect management. There were significant associations between the SSRI+ group of mothers and infant negative affect. This group of mothers also showed significant associations with infants' averting and avoiding behaviors in both play situations. The SSRI-alone group was similar to the control group and showed variable associations with infant's positive, negative, and sober moods unlike the SSRI+ group. There were no differences in infants' capacity for self-regulation in psychotropic exposed and non-exposed groups. Increased awareness of these vulnerable subgroups (SSRI-alone and SSRI+) is needed, in order to safeguard these dyads through better support systems and improved management.", 
    "95": "To elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind physical inactivity-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, 12 young, healthy male subjects completed 7 days of bed rest with vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained before and after. In six of the subjects, muscle biopsies were taken from both legs before and after a 3-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp performed 3 h after a 45-min, one-legged exercise. Blood samples were obtained from one femoral artery and both femoral veins before and during the clamp. Glucose infusion rate and leg glucose extraction during the clamp were lower after than before bed rest. This bed rest-induced insulin resistance occurred together with reduced muscle GLUT4, hexokinase II, protein kinase B/Akt1, and Akt2 protein level, and a tendency for reduced 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. The ability of insulin to phosphorylate Akt and activate glycogen synthase (GS) was reduced with normal GS site 3 but abnormal GS site 2+2a phosphorylation after bed rest. Exercise enhanced insulin-stimulated leg glucose extraction both before and after bed rest, which was accompanied by higher GS activity in the prior-exercised leg than the rested leg. The present findings demonstrate that physical inactivity-induced insulin resistance in muscle is associated with lower content/activity of key proteins in glucose transport/phosphorylation and storage.", 
    "96": "Despite being potent anxiolytic agents, benzodiazepines (BDZ) sometimes show reduced therapeutic efficacy in stressed rodents. However, the effectiveness of norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) or other anxiolytic interventions, e.g., exercise, remained elusive. Here, we demonstrated that male rats subjected to restraint stress for 4 weeks showed decreases in percent open arm time and open arm entry, as determined by elevated plus-maze test (EPM). Increases in inhibitory avoidance trial 2 and outer zone time were also observed in elevated T-maze (ETM) and open field test (OFT), respectively. To evaluate the anxiolytic-like actions of exercise and anxiolytic drugs, stressed rats were subjected for 4 weeks to swimming or daily gavage with 2mg/kg diazepam (BDZ), or 10mg/kg fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), reboxetine (NRI), or venlafaxine (SNRI). In EPM, the open arm activity was higher in the swimming, reboxetine-treated and venlafaxine-treated groups as compared to age-matched controls, while diazepam and fluoxetine were without effect. In ETM, a reduction in avoidance latency was observed only in swimming and venlafaxine-treated groups. However, the combined swimming and pharmacological treatment showed no additive anxiolytic-like effect. It could be concluded that restraint stress induced anxiety-like behaviors, which were not responsive to diazepam or fluoxetine, whereas reboxetine, venlafaxine and swimming showed anxiolytic-like actions in stressed rats.", 
    "97": "Telithromycin is a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A4), with dose- and time-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK). We hypothesized that the time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4 was responsible for the nonlinear PK of telithromycin and then used physiologically based PK (PBPK) modeling and simulation to verify this mechanism. Telithromycin PBPK models integrating in vitro, in silico, and in vivo PK data ruled out the contribution of enzyme/transporter saturation and suggested that TDI is a plausible mechanism for PK nonlinearity. The model successfully predicted the clinical interaction with the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam, as verified by external data not used for the model-building (intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) midazolam area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio with/without concurrent telithromycin administration: 3.26 and 6.72 predicted vs. 2.20 and 6.11 observed, respectively). Models assuming reversible inhibition failed to predict such strong CYP3A4 inhibition.

Prevalence of the disorder in general population is estimated at 5 to 15%. Family history is positive in over 50% of idiopathic RLS patients which points to genetic basis of the disorder. The characteristics of the secondary or acquired form of RLS are symptoms that start later in life as well as a rapid progression of the disease. On the other hand, idiopathic RLS more often starts at a younger age and the prognoses are better. Over twenty disorders and conditions are brought in connection with secondary RLS. Although the cause of primary RLS is still unknown, there is a strong connection between central metabolism of iron as well as dopamine levels and RLS manifestation. A differential diagnosis of RLS includes a wide specter of motor and sensory disorders. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and the history of disease. To correctly diagnose idiopathic RLS one must first eliminate secondary causes of RLS and then also exclude any disorders with clinical features that mimic those of RLS. It has been estimated that some 20 to 25% of patients need pharmacological therapy. Best initial therapy is the application of nonergot dopamine agonists. Anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines and opioides can be given to patients who are refractory to dopaminergic therapy, those suffering from RLS with emphasized painful sensory component and those with RLS connected with insomnia.",

The aim of this study was to understand how the in situ self-assembly of a mucoretentive delivery system, formed by the dissolution of vinyl polymer-coated microparticles in the nasal mucosa, would influence lorazepam pharmacokinetics (PK). IN administration of the uncoated lorazepam powder (particle size, 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0\u03bcm) generated a biphasic PK profile, which was indicative of sequential intranasal and oral absorption (n\u2009=\u20096; dose, 5\u00a0mg/kg). Coating the drug with the vinyl polymer, MP1 (9.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00a0\u03bcm with 38.8\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0%, w/w lorazepam) and MP2 (10.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0\u03bcm with 47.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0%, w/w lorazepam), allowed rapid systemic absorption (MP1, T (max) 14.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u00a0min; MP2, T (max) 9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u00a0min) in rabbits and modified the PK profiles in a manner that suggested successful nasal retention. The poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)-rich MP2 system provided the best comparative bioavailability, it prolonged the early-phase nasal drug absorption and minimised drug mucociliary clearance, which correlated well with the intermolecular hydrogen-bond-driven vinyl polymer interactions observed in vitro.", 
    "104": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the putative activity of a methanol extract of Hypericum montbretti (Guttiferae) on the central nervous system. Rutin (1519\u2009ppm) and quercitrin (784\u2009ppm) were identified as the major phenolic compounds in the extract. When administered at 25, 50 and 100\u2009mg/kg doses, the extract decreased the total number of head-dipping behaviours performed by mice during a hole-board test. Administration of both the extract and diazepam (2\u2009mg/kg) reduced spontaneous locomotory activity, potentiated hexobarbital (60\u2009mg/kg)-induced sleeping parameters and prevented pentylenetetrazole (80\u2009mg/kg)-induced seizures relative to the controls. These findings are the first to indicate the sedative and anticonvulsant activities of H. montbretti extract. Atropine (2\u2009mg/kg) and naloxone (5\u2009mg/kg) pre-treatment did not reverse the sedative effect, indicating that muscarinic and opioidergic mechanisms did not contribute to the pharmacological action. However, pre-treatment with flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) reversed both the sedative and anticonvulsant effects induced by a 100\u2009mg/kg dose of the extract, indicating the involvement of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. In conclusion, H. montbretti extract is a novel candidate as a sedative and anticonvulsant drug for the treatment of sleep disorders and for the prevention of epileptic seizures.", 
    "105": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by extreme hypophagia, hyperactivity, and fear of weight gain. No approved pharmacological treatments exist for AN despite high mortality rates. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) phenomenon models aspects of AN in rodents, including progressive weight loss, reduced food intake, and hyperactivity. First, we optimized the ABA paradigm for mice. We compared mouse strains (Balb/cJ, A/J) for susceptibility with ABA, and evaluated the effects of different food access durations (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\u2009h) on ABA parameters. Balb/cJ mice exhibited significantly shorter survival time (days until 25% bodyweight loss) in the ABA paradigm compared with A/J mice. Furthermore, 6\u2009h of food access reduced survival in mice housed with wheels without reducing survival in mice housed without wheels. We then evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with fluoxetine (4 weeks) or subchronic treatment with olanzapine (OLZ) (1 week) on ABA in BALB/cJ mice. OLZ (12\u2009mg/kg/day) significantly increased survival and reduced food anticipatory activity (FAA). However, OLZ did not alter food intake or running wheel activity during ad-lib feeding (baseline) or restriction conditions, or in mice housed without wheels. Fluoxetine (18\u2009mg/kg/day) increased food intake and reduced FAA, but did not alter survival. Here, we report for the first time that OLZ, but not fluoxetine, reduces ABA in mice. Our findings indicate further need for clinical investigations into the effects of OLZ, but not selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on core features of AN.",

Pregabalin lowered total Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores within 1 week and was effective against both somatic and psychic subcomponents. In 1 controlled clinical trial, pregabalin was found to be effective in patients aged 65 years and older. Another trial demonstrated improved relapse rates when pregabalin, compared with placebo, was used for up to 6 months. The most commonly experienced adverse events were somnolence, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth.", 
    "114": "Available evidence suggests that pregabalin is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of GAD. As somnolence and dizziness are common adverse effects, caution should be used in elderly patients. Pregabalin rapidly relieves anxiety, a benefit that it may have over many other currently available therapeutic options besides benzodiazepines. While not a first-line therapy in GAD, pregabalin offers another treatment option in patients who do not respond to or who suffer intolerable adverse effects from other agents.", 
    "115": "The elevated T-maze (ETM) is an apparatus derived from the elevated plus-maze test, which is used to evaluate anxiety. Because anxiety is a biasing factor in models of memory, this study proposed the ETM as a task for the simultaneous assessment of memory and anxiety in mice. The ETM consists of one enclosed and two open arms. The procedure is based on the avoidance of open spaces learned during training session, in which mice were exposed to the enclosed arm as many times as needed to stay 300s. In the test session, memory is assessed by re-exposing the mouse to the enclosed arm and the latency to enter an open arm was recorded. The anxiolytic diazepam (DZP; 1 or 2mg/kg) and the amnestic biperiden (BPR; 0.5, 1 or 3mg/kg) were injected at three distinct times: pre-training, post-training, and pre-test. Pre-training administration of BPR 1 and DZP 2 increased the number of trials needed to reach the avoidance criterion, suggesting a passive avoidance learning impairment. However, BPR induced hyperlocomotion, which could bias the interpretation of any BPR-induced effects during the training session. Pre-training injection of BPR did not affect the spontaneous increase in the latency to enter an open arm between trials, while DZP reduced latencies in the first three trials suggesting anxiolysis. In the test session, pre-training injection of BPR 1 and DZP 2 reduced latencies to enter an open arm, indicating memory impairment. Post-training and pre-test injection of DZP or BPR did not affect memory. In conclusion, the proposed ETM task is practical for the detection of the anxiolytic and amnesic effects of drugs.",

The drugs spiked in plasma were extracted with ethyl acetate after alkalization with 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution. The organic solvent was evaporated under nitrogen stream, and the residues were redissolved by ethyl acetate. The separation was performed on an HP-5MS column (30 m x 250 microm x 0.25 microm). The analytes were determined and identified using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode and scan mode, respectively. The internal standard method was used for the determination. The target analytes were well separated from each other on their SIM chromatograms and also on the total ion current (TIC) chromatograms. The blank extract from human plasma gave no peaks that interfered with all the analytes on the chromatogram. The calibration curves for 10 sedative-hypnotics showed excellent linearity. The correlation coefficients of all the drugs were higher than 0.9954. The recoveries of the drugs spiked in human plasma ranged from 92.28% to 111.7%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra-day and inter-day determinations were from 4.09% to 14.26%. The detection limits ranged from 2 to 20 microg/L. The method is simple, reliable, rapid and sensitive for the determination and the quantification of 10 sedative-hypnotics in human plasma and seems to be useful in the practice of clinical toxicological cases.",

Structured interviews were performed with 311 caregivers of people with or without dementia and they completed questionnaires. Among the caregivers, 196 (63%) were caregivers of patients with dementia and 115 (37%) were caregivers of patients without dementia. Forty-four caregivers (14.1%) were taking psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines or antidepressants), and this usage was more frequent among caregivers of patients with dementia (p<0.01). Twenty-two caregivers of patients with dementia (11.4%) had used sleeping pills after beginning care, compared with only five (4.3%) caregivers of patients without dementia (p<0.01).

First-shot motor response was achieved in all but one patient in Group A; here we were only able to locate the plexus by use of ultrasound. None of the patients needed general anaesthesia. There were no significant differences between postoperative pain, motor power, or patient's satisfaction. ISBPB seems similarly effective using electro-stimulation and ultrasound if performed by experienced anesthesiologists.", 
    "124": "Phenazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that, unlike other benzodiazepines, is currently not scheduled as a narcotic in Finland, most other European countries or the USA. It is used as an anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic and anti-epileptic, mainly in Russia. In Finland, as well as in some other countries, an increase in the unauthorized use of phenazepam has been observed in recent years. In the one year period between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011 the prevalence of phenazepam in Finland was assessed among drivers apprehended for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID), in medico-legal autopsy cases and in police confiscations of illicit drugs. In DUID cases an LC-MS/MS method preceded by solid phase extraction was used for the determination of phenazepam. In the post-mortem investigations the sample preparation consisted of liquid-liquid extraction followed by derivatization and the determination was carried out by GC-MS. The police confiscations were analysed by GC-MS. There were 141 positive phenazepam cases among apprehended drivers, representing approximately 3.5% of all confirmed drug cases (n=4007) in this time period. The median (range) phenazepam blood concentration in DUID cases was 0.061 mg/L (0.004-3.600 mg/L). The median phenazepam concentration in cases with no concomitant stimulant use was significantly higher than the overall median concentration. Phenazepam was found in 17 medico-legal autopsy cases and the median (range) blood concentration was 0.048 mg/L (0.007-1.600 mg/L). Phenazepam was not considered by the medico-legal team to be the sole cause of death in any of the cases, the majority of them being accidental opiod overdoses. There were 26 seizures of phenazepam by the Police in the time period studied, some of the batches consisted of a mixture of phenazepam and stimulant designer drugs. The data show that phenazepam abuse is a widespread phenomenon in Finland. A typical user was a male multi-drug user in his 30s. The concentration range of phenazepam among apprehended drivers and medico-legal autopsy cases was wide and the drug was usually found along with other psychoactive drugs. Therefore, although it seems likely that phenazepam contributed to impairment of driving in some DUID cases, the extent of its effect remains unclear and further studies are needed to define the concentrations causing impairment and toxicity.",

Due to very limited licensed geographical distribution, there is very little peer-reviewed literature that is not written in Russian. In this article, we review the current state of what is currently known about phenazepam.

    "129": "The term Excited Delirium Syndrome (ExDS) has traditionally been used in the forensic literature to describe findings in a subgroup of patients with delirium who suffered lethal consequences from their untreated severe agitation.(1-5) Excited delirium syndrome, also known as agitated delirium, is generally defined as altered mental status and combativeness or aggressiveness. Although the exact signs and symptoms are difficult to define precisely, clinical findings often include many of the following: tolerance to significant pain, rapid breathing, sweating, severe agitation, elevated temperature, delirium, non-compliance or poor awareness to direction from police or medical personnel, lack of fatiguing, unusual or superhuman strength, and inappropriate clothing for the current environment. It has become increasingly recognized that individuals displaying ExDS are at high risk for sudden death, and ExDS therefore represents a true medical emergency. Recently the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) published the findings of a white paper on the topic of ExDS to better find consensus on the issues of definition, diagnosis, and treatment.(6) In so doing, ACEP joined the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) in recognizing ExDS as a medical condition. For both paramedics and physicians, the difficulty in diagnosing the underlying cause of ExDS in an individual patient is that the presenting clinical signs and symptoms of ExDS can be produced by a wide variety of clinical disease processes. For example, agitation, combativeness, and altered mental status can be produced by hypoglycemia, thyroid storm, certain kinds of seizures, and these conditions can be difficult to distinguish from those produced by cocaine or methamphetamine intoxication.(7) Prehospital personnel are generally not expected to differentiate between the multiple possible causes of the patient's presentation, but rather simply to recognize that the patient has a medical emergency and initiate appropriate stabilizing treatment. ExDS patients will generally require transfer to an emergency department (ED) for further management, evaluation, and definitive care. In this paper, we present a typical ExDS case and then review existing literature for current treatment options.",

The syndrome of catatonia must be taken into consideration and although it is normally associated with psychiatric diagnoses, it is also very often found in a great variety of neurological and medical conditions. Due to the clinical complexity of catatonia, there are still difficulties in its correct identification and initial management, something that leads to diagnostic delays and increased morbidity and mortality. In this article, a review of the literature on catatonia is presented with the aim of assisting emergency department doctors (and clinicians assessing patients in emergency situations) in considering this condition in the differential diagnosis of stupor due to its high frequency of association with organic pathology.", 
    "132": "The practice of sedation, including monitoring practice for digestive endoscopy, continues to evolve throughout the world. In many countries, including Switzerland, there is a trend towards increased utilization of sedation during both routine and advanced endoscopic procedures. Sedation improves patient satisfaction with endoscopy and also improves the quality of the examination. In addition, a trend can be observed towards an increasing use of propofol as the preferred sedative drug. Here we review the latest published data from surveys describing sedation and monitoring practice in different countries and compare them with our own data from successive nationwide surveys among Swiss gastroenterologists over a period of 20 years. This development between these socioeconomically very similar Western industrialized countries, however, shows some unique and surprising differences. In Germany and Switzerland, propofol use has become increasingly widespread, in Switzerland even to the extent that during the last few years propofol has overtaken benzodiazepine sedation, with an absolute majority of Swiss gastroenterologists using it without the assistance of an anesthesiologist. In addition, the change in Switzerland reflects a successful generalization of nonanesthesiologist-administered propofol (NAAP) sedation from the hospital setting to private practice.", 
    "133": "The occurrence of status epilepticus (SE) is considered the main cause of brain lesions and morphological alterations, such as hippocampal neuron loss, that result in chronic epilepsy. Previous work demonstrated the convulsive and widespread neuropathological effects of soman, an organophosphorus compound that causes SE and severe recurrent seizures as a result of exposure. Seizures begin rapidly after exposure, can continue for hours, and contribute to prolonged physical incapacitation of the victim. This study attempts to identify anticonvulsive and neuroprotective drugs against soman exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1.0 LD(50) soman. EEGraphical and neuropathological (Fluoro-Jade B staining) effects were analyzed at 72 h post-exposure to soman and subsequent treatments with diazepam (DZP) alone or in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or valproic acid (VPA). The extent of brain damage was dependent on the length of SE and not on the number of recurrent seizures. DZP treatment alone decreased SE time and damage in hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and cortex, but not in piriform nuclei. The combination of DZP and VPA 100 mg/kg showed more anticonvulsive effects, decreased SE time, and afforded more neuroprotection in the hippocampus, mainly the ventral portion. The combination DZP and SAHA 25 mg/kg was more neuroprotective, but not more anticonvulsant than DZP alone. The DZP combination with VPA HDAC inhibitor proved to be a good treatment for SE and neuronal damage caused by soman exposure.",

Although afebrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) have been described to develop later in the clinical course of BMEI, mostly during adolescence, an association with GTCS in the early stage of BMEI has never been recognized. We herein report seven children who satisfied the criteria of BMEI except for the recurrence of GTCS before the onset of MS. The age of onset and ictal video-polygraphic features of MS, as well as the long-term seizure and developmental outcome in these children were similar to those of children with typical BMEI. Furthermore, these GTCS mostly disappeared within several months and were replaced by MS. Our study indicates that these children may constitute a BMEI subgroup, expanding the spectrum of BMEI.",

    "148": "Evidence indicates that synchronization of cortical activity at gamma-band frequencies, mediated through GABA-A receptors, is important for perceptual/cognitive processes. To study GABA signaling in vivo, we recently used a novel positron emission tomography (PET) paradigm measuring the change in binding of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site radiotracer [(11)C]flumazenil associated with increases in extracellular GABA induced via GABA membrane transporter (GAT1) blockade with tiagabine. GAT1 blockade resulted in significant increases in [(11)C]flumazenil binding potential (BPND) over baseline in the major functional domains of the cortex, consistent with preclinical studies showing that increased GABA levels enhance the affinity of GABA-A receptors for BDZ ligands. In the current study we sought to replicate our previous results and to further validate this approach by demonstrating that the magnitude of increase in [(11)C]flumazenil binding observed with PET is directly correlated with tiagabine dose. [(11)C]flumazenil distribution volume (VT) was measured in 18 healthy volunteers before and after GAT1 blockade with tiagabine. Two dose groups were studied (n = 9 per group; Group I: tiagabine 0.15 mg/kg; Group II: tiagabine 0.25 mg/kg). GAT1 blockade resulted in increases in mean (\u00b1 SD) [(11)C]flumazenil VT in Group II in association cortices (6.8 \u00b1 0.8 mL g-1 vs. 7.3 \u00b1 0.4 mL g-1;p = 0.03), sensory cortices (6.7 \u00b1 0.8 mL g-1 vs. 7.3 \u00b1 0.5 mL g-1;p = 0.02) and limbic regions (5.2 \u00b1 0.6 mL g-1 vs. 5.7 \u00b1 0.3 mL g-1;p = 0.03). No change was observed at the low dose (Group I). Increased orbital frontal cortex binding of [(11)C]flumazenil in Group II correlated with the ability to entrain cortical networks (r = 0.67, p = 0.05) measured via EEG during a cognitive control task. These data provide a replication of our previous study demonstrating the ability to measure in vivo, with PET, acute shifts in extracellular GABA.",

Ischemia/reperfusion and I(Ks) blockade were found to significantly induce MAPD90 prolongation and increase triangulation at the epicardial zone at 45 min, 60 min, and 75 min after reperfusion, accompanied with an increase in premature ventricular beats (PVBs) during the same period. Additionally, I(Ks) channel subunit expression was examined following transient ischemia or permanent infarction and changes in monophasic action potential (MAP) waveforms challenged by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation were evaluated using a rabbit model of transient or chronic cardiac ischemia. The epicardial MAP in the peri-infarct zone of hearts subjected to infarction for 2 days exhibited increased triangulation under adrenergic stimulation.

    "152": "The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is essential for cellular uptake of iron, mediating iron absorption across the duodenal brush border membrane. We have previously shown that with iron feeding DMT1 in the brush border membrane undergoes endocytosis into the subapical compartment of enterocytes. To understand the mechanisms of iron-induced endocytosis of DMT1, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to find proteins that interact with DMT1 and isolated from a rat duodenal cDNA library a protein that interacts specifically with the IRE containing isoform of DMT1 {DMT1 [iron-responsive element (IRE)]}. The protein (Genbank AY336075) is 97.5% identical with peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 7 (PAP7), a protein that interacts with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. PAP7 is ubiquitously expressed in the rat and in multiple cell lines with consensus sequences including a nuclear localization signal and a Golgi dynamic domain. PAP7, expressed on the brush border of rat duodenum, copurified with DMT1 in brush border membrane vesicles, and following iron feeding, was internalized in parallel with the internalization of DMT1. To determine if PAP7 plays a role in cellular iron metabolism, we downregulated PAP7 expression in K562 cells with small interfering RNA. Following the decrease in PAP7 protein, DMT1 (IRE) protein but not mRNA was significantly downregulated but without effect on DMT1 (non-IRE), transferin (Tf)R1, or ferritin expression. Lowered levels of PAP7 resulted also in decreased cell proliferation and G(1) cell cycle arrest. These data are consistent with PAP7 interacting with DMT1 (IRE) and regulating DMT1 (IRE) expression in K562 cells by modulating expression of DMT1 (IRE) protein.", 
    "153": "The purpose of this study was to develop an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method of 22 antiepileptics for routine therapeutic monitoring. The antiepileptics used in the analyses were carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, clobazam, N-desmethylclobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, ethosuximide, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, N-desmethylmesuximide, nitrazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, tiagabine, topiramate, valproic acid, vigabatrin and zonisamide. After protein precipitation of 50\u2009\u03bcL plasma with methanol, the supernatant was diluted with water or was evaporated to dryness and reconstituted with mobile phase in the case of benzodiazepines. Separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC BEH C\u2081\u2088 column with a gradient mobile phase of 10\u2009mm ammonium acetate containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol at a flow rate of 0.4\u2009mL/min. An Acquity TQD instrument in multiple reaction monitoring mode with ion mode switching was used for detection. All antiepileptics were detected and quantified within 10\u2009min, with no endogenous interference. All the calibration curves showed good linearity in the therapeutic range (r\u00b2 \u2009<\u20090.99). The precision and accuracy values for intra- and inter-assays were within \u00b115% except for phenobarbital and tiagabine. A good correlation was observed between the concentration of clinical samples measured by the new method described here and the conventional methods. The values of carbamazepine and phenytoin by UPLC-MS/MS were lower than those detected by the immunoassays, which might be caused by the cross-reaction of antibodies with their metabolites. In conclusion, we developed a simple and selective UPLC-MS/MS method suitable for routine therapeutic monitoring of antiepileptics.",

Compared to the HTR subgroup, the LTR subgroup presented a lower binding of [(3)H]-MK-801 in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum. The subgroups did not differ in K(+)-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity, but the LTR subgroup had a lower density of isozymes with a high-affinity to ouabain in the brainstem and in the frontal cortex and a lower affinity to ouabain in the hippocampus than the HTR subgroup. These results suggest that NMDA receptors and ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+)-ATPase isozymes may underlie the susceptibility to DMCM-induced convulsions.",

    "164": "When we refer to \"drunkenness\", more often than not, we think of alcohol or cannabis being the instigator rather than pharmacological drugs, even if outside the toxic origins, \"drunkenness\" may also occur without any substance intake: one can be drunk on love, poetry, music and even mania. Benzodiazepine \"drunkenness\" is not a classical notion in medicine. But the concept of addictology allows one to enlarge different approaches and to consider the relationship with psychoactive substances according to the same references. So, in a single fashion, between use and misuse, is it possible to resort to the same concepts for pharmacological drugs, including \"drunkenness\"?", 
    "165": "Any intake of a psychoactive substance, limited in time, which will take the consumer some time to recover from, can be called simple use, intoxication or drunkenness. Intoxication is rather a classical medical concept linked with poisoning, and hence the toxicological aspects prevail particularly through the concept of a toxidrome. However, little research has been done on \"drunkenness\" in other medical aspects, neither psychological aspects nor sociological aspects. If poisoning is defined as soon as a poison is introduced into the body, the intoxication arises after a threshold (that toxicology usually defines), but no means are available to measure the onset of the inebriation, neither any ingested amounts nor any toxic concentration in the body. It is hard to define \"drunkenness\" simply. At first, it is most often seen as a pathology in medicine, unlike in every day life. \"Drunkenness\" can be the result of physiological disturbances, notably through the effects of substances and can therefore be the manifestation of a cerebral dysfunction. Alternatively, it can arise from a variation of emotional or sensorial stimuli. If the feelings associated with drunkenness are positive and pleasant a repetition will occur in the search to reproduce enjoyable effects in reference to neurophysiological models of reward systems of the brain, and can tend to be limited to a search for pleasure. Moreover, \"drunkenness\" may be considered as a leak, a regression or a kind of renouncement. It may sometimes be a search for sedation, for conscious sleep, or to avoid reality. And, finally, \"drunkenness\" may be suicidal. Since the launch of benzodiazepines on the market during the sixties, their prescription has developed, making them so readily available in France that they are nearly as easy to obtain as alcohol. The widespread diffusion of these psychoactive substances, obtained with or without medical prescription, renders them one of the principle means of chemically modulating thought and consciousness that has become accessible to all. One of the first reasons for this is the easy and wide prescription of these drugs by almost all practitioners. Choosing between benzodiazepines or alcohol (or associating both substances) is not fortuitous. Besides intoxication with pharmacological drugs, whether voluntary or otherwise, medication overdose and iatrogenic effects, there is an incidence of a substantial use of over the counter psychoactive drugs in order to trigger other effects than suicide or self-harm. This use of pharmacological drugs, sometimes referred to as \"entertaining\", can lead to massive intake with dramatic behavioural response. Is it then possible to use the same term \"drunkenness\" for a pharmacological drug-induced state as for a state provoked by other psychoactive substances with addictive potential\u00a0? The clinical presentation of benzodiazepine \"drunkenness\" resembles the pharmacological effects of these drugs. If we link alcoholic and benzodiazepine \"drunkenness\", we can draw a parallel between the properties, the action mechanisms, the effects and the risks incurred by the consumption of these two classes of psychotropics. The similarities concern the existence of a preclinical phase, of the same biochemical or neurophysiological basis, of the same properties, notably complex relationships with anxiety. They also have the same amnesiac effects, possible paradoxical effects, or sedation potentialities that may lead to coma, respiratory depression and death. But differences exist for benzodiazepines, in the lack of disinhibition effects, the lack of cerebellar effects, the variability of elimination kinetics according to the molecules, the rarity or the lack of \"recreational\" intakes, and the lack of easy blood level measurements.", 
    "166": "An attempt is made to outline the definition of benzodiazepine \"drunkenness\", including sociological, psychological, and medical dimensions beyond the sole toxicological aspects. So, studying the misuse of benzodiazepines in more detail including the acute effects such as \"drunkenness\", except suicidal or mortiferous tendencies, can allow further development of its recognition, screening and prevention.",

In the elevated plus-maze test, riluzole significantly increased the time spent in, and entries into, the open arm after 60\u00a0min administration. This finding was supported by results obtained from light/dark and open-field tests. The magnitude of the anxiolytic-like effects of riluzole in each of the behavioral models was similar to those produced by a benzodiazepine, diazepam, suggesting that riluzole has a robust anxiolytic-like activity in rats. To clarify the involvement of sodium channels in this anxiolytic activity, we examined the effect of a co-administered sodium channel activator, veratrine. The anxiolytic-like action of riluzole was diminished by veratrine in the elevated plus-maze, light/dark and open-field tests. Based on these results, it is suggested that the anxiolytic mechanism of riluzole is clearly distinct from that of diazepam. In addition, to examine whether riluzole directly and non-selectively affected the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, we performed three behavioral tests (footprint analysis, Y-maze test and the ethanol-induced sleeping time test) that are closely related to the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine pathways. In contrast to diazepam, riluzole produced no significant effects in these tests.
