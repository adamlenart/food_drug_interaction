    "0": "Responding of two squirrel monkeys was maintained under a multiple 5-min fixed-interval schedule of food presentation and termination of a stimulus in the presence of which shocks occurred. Under the stimulus-shock termination schedule, shocks occurred independently of responding, on the average of every three minutes; a response after 5 min terminated the prevailing stimulus and shock-presentation schedule. Response rates and patterns of responding under both schedules were comparable although they differed slightly between monkeys. d-Amphetamine increased and promazine decreased responding under both fixed-interval schedules. Chlordiazepoxide increased responding maintained by food presentation but decreased responding maintained by termination of the stimulus-shock complex. Under certain conditions and with certain drugs, the event that maintains responding can determine the effects a drug will have on behavior.", 
    "1": "Comparative effects of anticonvulsant drugs on the thalamocortical system were analyzed quantitatively. Paired stimuli were delivered to the ventrolateral thalamus with evoked responses recorded from the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex in the cat. Threshold and excitability profiles were developed with an on-line computer. Effects of phenytoin and diazepam were generally similar, with depression of excitability and slight elevation of thresholds. Ethosuximide produced a pronounced pair-interval dependent effect of unchanged or increased excitability and lowered threshold at shorter intervals, with depressed excitability and raised threshold at longer intervals. These data demonstrate a marked difference in effect of the petit mal and grand mal agents tested and suggest a basis for the effectiveness of ethosuximide in controlling 3-per-second repetitive activity.", 
    "2": "Effects of anticonvulsants were determined on thalamic afterdischarge in gallamine-immobilized cats and d-tubocurarine-immobilized rats in order to clarify the participation of anticonvulsants in the thalamus. Thalamic afterdischarge was induced by electrical stimulation of cat nucleus centralis lateralis and rat nucleus reticularis at 50 Hz, 1 msec for 4 sec. In cats, diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and diazepam raised afterdischarge threshold, and shortened its duration induced at twice the threshold voltage. Trimethadione and dipropylacetate raised the threshold, but did not change the duration. In rats, diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital, and diazepam raised the threshold, and shortened the duration with comparable dose ranges used for cats. Dipropylacetate and acetazolamide raised the threshold, although did not change the duration except for shortening action with a higher dose of dipropylacetate. Trimethadione was without effect. These results suggest that the depressive effect of anticonvulsants on the thalamus is, at least in part, associated with control of the epilepsies.", 
    "3": "The antibacterial activity of a set of 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives against Staph, aureus and Strep, pyogenes has been correlated with structural features of the compounds examined. It is shown by means of substituent constants and regression analysis that the lipophilic character of the molecule is the most important factor in determining its activity. Electronic and steric effects appear to be quite important.", 
    "4": "We compare the effects of chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, and placebo on hostility, as both an inner motivational or potential state and verbal interpersonal behavior. This article reports the findings relevant to the latter dimension of hostility and integrates them with those findings, presented in an initial report, relevant to hostility as an inner motivational state. The verbal data again support the hypothesis that chlordiazepoxide-induced increases in verbal interpersonal hostility, following frustration, are greater than those associated with placebo. With regard to oxazepam, the verbal hostility data were consonant with the motivational data that suggested that oxazepam does not substantially disinhibit hostility but did not as consistently differentiate oxazepam and chlordiazepoxide at the level of overt hostile behavior.", 
    "5": "A double-blind random study compared lorazepam with diazepam as i.m. premedicants in 84 healthy women undergoing uterine curettage. Anxiety, assessed by a self-rating test by the patient and by a trained observer, was reduced 90 min after both lorazepam (P less than 0.001) and diazepam (P less than 0.01). There was more sedation and a longer recovery time after lorazepam than after diazepam. Amnesia at 24 h after operation (lack of recall rather than lack of recognition) was greater after lorazepam. There was transient local discomfort at the site of the injection in most patients in both groups, but no serious effects. Local erythema was present in 12 patients who received lorazepam and 10 who received diazepam 90 min after the injection, disappearing after 24 h in the former group but remaining in the latter. The incidence of nausea, vomiting and headache in both groups was small and similar, but there was more restlessness and dizziness after diazepam in the early recovery period.", 
    "6": "Recent advances in alcohol withdrawal states are described. New concepts of classification, the development of the syndrome and its management are outlined. In the light of recent research, more optimistic results for this much maligned but common condition may be achieved.", 
    "7": "The occurrence of thrombosis and phlebitis after intravenous injection of 10 mg diazepam, 4 mg lorazepam, or 1-2 mg flunitrazepam was studied on the second or third and the seventh to 10th days. A significantly higher incidence occurred with all drugs on days 7 to 10 than on days 2 and 3. Painless thrombosis occurred much more often with diazepam than with the other two benzodiazepines. Its incidence was greater in small hand or arm veins than in large antecubital vessels. Lorazepam and flunitrazepam therefore have clear advantages over diazepam.", 
    "8": "Diazepam, a potent minor tranquilizer, binds with high affinity to a specific benzodiazepine receptor that occurs exclusively in the central nervous system. The receptor is mainly localized in the synaptic membrane fraction. Binding to the receptor is stereospecific. Competition for the receptor by various benzodiazepines closely parallels their pharmacological potency.", 
    "9": "Repeated administration of flurazepam reduced stage 4 sleep (high delta-wave concentration) but produced a greater increase in stage 2 duration so that total sleep time was increased. Computer analysis revealed that the increased amount of stage 2 (low delta-wave concentration) sleep provided a number and duration of delta waves sufficient to offset the loss of delta activity in stage 4. However, the amplitude of the average delta wave was reduced. These results demonstrate the value of direct quantification of delta-wave activity, the variable that underlies visual classification of slow-wave sleep into stages 2 to 4. They also give rise to new hypotheses regarding the relative absence of side effects in spite of profound stage 4 suppression by flurazepam and the mechanisms by which total sleep time is increased by this drug.", 
    "10": "Seven mentally-retarded children, diagnosed as hyperactive, participated in a double-blind trial of the drug lorazepam (Ativan). Statistical analysis of the behavioural records showed that hyperactivity was typically greater during lorazepam than during placebo periods. The degree of hyperactivity was not systematically related to dosage level. The drug is therefore contraindicated for the control of hyperactivity in mentally retarded children.", 
    "11": "A radioimmunoassay for the determination of diazepam in human blood and serum is presented. Diazepam is separated from the bulk of the biological material by adsorption at Amberlite XAD-2 and subsequent desorption with ethyl acetate. The extract thus obtained can be used directly for the determination od diazepam by radioimmunoassay and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. For the combined radioimmunological and gas chromatographic determination 0.5 ml of blood or serum are necessary, the lower detection limit being approx. 5 ng/ml for both of these procedures. A good reliability of the radioimmunoassay is established with respect to precision, accuracy and specificity. The quantitative results obtained by radioimmunoassay and gas chromatography correspond well with each other. The radioimmunological procedure enables the screening of more than 200 samples for diazepam by one technician within two working days.", 
    "12": "Three groups of male and female subjects aged 24-74 years received 25, 100, or 200 mg of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride by mouth as a single dose or as two divided doses. The relation of plasma or whole blood concentrations for chlordiazepoxide (CDX) and its metabolite, desmethylchlordiazepoxide (DMCDX), to time since the last dose, weight, age, and sex were determined by simple and multiple regression analyses. Both CDX and DMCDX levels were negatively correlated with weight. Concentrations of CDX decreased, while those of DMCDX increased, with the time since the last dose. Lower levels of both drugs were associated with female sex, and lower levels of DMCDX were noted with increasing age. In the largest sample group, age and weight were more important variables than sex in accounting for CDX and DMCDX. Sex was of significance, and more important than time or age in explaining the variance of CDX in one series of observations. Multiple regression analysis is a useful approach to assessing interrelated factors influencing blood levels of drugs, especially when combined with a consideration of the interactive components of variance. Age and sex, in addition to weight and time, may be important factors that deserve further attention.", 
    "13": "The action of diazepam on the parallel fibres-Purkinje cell synapse was studied in a perfused frog cerebellum. Diazepam facilitates the excitatory input to Purkinje cells and hence increases the inhibition produced by Purkinje cells activity.", 
    "14": "It has been shown that cleavage of the N-terminal L-amino acids of a novel series of dipeptide derivatives of 2-aminobenzophenones occurs readily in vivo to give benzo-1,4-diazepines. Such compounds may serve as useful pro-drug forms of minor tranquilizers such as Valium.", 
    "15": "A prospective double-blind study of the effects of sedation in 142 patients undergoing gastro-intestinal endoscopy was performed. Four regimens were studied (neurolept analgesia with and without topical anaesthesia, and anticholinergic and topical anaesthesia, with and without diazepam). Droperidol and fentanyl without topical anaesthesia yielded the best results as far as tolerance and side-effects were concerned. It is suggested that this form of neurolept analgesia be used for gastro-intestinal endoscopy.", 
    "16": "In six suburban areas of Sydney, chosen to provide a socioeconomic cross-section of the city, complete records of dispensing of benzodiazepine were collected over a four-week period. These drugs constituted 3.7% of all dispensing, female patients outnumbered males by 2.3:1, and 98% of patients were over 20 years of age. The predominance of females, and higher age groups was found in all the areas studied, but no socioeconomic correlation was detected in the use of the drugs. Analysis of national dispensing figures confirmed the higher consumption in higher age groups, and revealed no heterogeneity in per capita prescribing rates amongst the States.", 
    "17": "A simple and specific 125I-radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the determination of the anticonvulsant agent clonazepam directly in plasma has been developed using a previously reported antiserum to the drug. The 125I-radioligand was prepared by reaction of 3-aminoclonazepam with a commercially available acylating reagent, 125I-N-succinimidyl 3(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, of high specific activity (approximately 1500 Ci/mM). The method has a workable range between 5 and 100 ng/ml of clonazepam using a 10 mu1 sample of plasma for analysis, which is satisfactory for routine clinical monitoring. The intra and inter-assay coefficients of variation did not exceed 3 and 9% respectively. Recovery of clonazepam was quantitative when the drug was added to a pool of plasma obtained from subjects who had received a wide variety of other anticonvulsants. Clinical plasma samples from subjects receiving clonazepam chronically were assayed for clonazepam by the new 125I-RIA and a previously reported 3H-RIA. The data was subjected to linear regression analysis which gave a slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of 1,-0.33 ng/ml and 0.994 respectively and demonstrated that the two methods are equivalent. However, the 125I-RIA is more rapid and less costly for routine monitoring than the 3H-RIA.", 
    "18": "Phencyclidine appears to be unique in action compared with other psychedelic drugs, and its effects are less dependent upon the individual's personality than are the effects of LSD or mescaline. The authors discuss the sensory, psychological, and behavioral symptoms of phencyclidine intoxication. Most cases are of short duration and the only treatment necessary may be observation together with minimal stimulation and diazepam. However, prolonged and severe behavioral disturbances, exaggeration of preexisting thought disorder, and serious medical complications commonly occur and must be considered in the treatment plan.", 
    "19": "The anti-nociceptive dose of difenamizole, morphine, aminopyrine and aspirin was studied for effects on behavior maintained by schedule of positive reinforcement. Male, albino rats were trained to press a lever for food pellets on a fixed-ratio (FR) 10 and 30 schedule of reinforcement or a differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) schedule. Difenamizole (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a dose-related decrease in the response under FR-10 schedule. The response rate decrease observed under the FR-10 schedule was similar to that resulting from the oral administration of 400 mg/kg of aminopyrine. Response in the FR-30 schedule was not affected by any dose of difenamizole (100 approximately 400 mg/kg, p.o.) and aminopyrine (200 approximately 400 mg/kg, p.o.). In the response maintained by the DRL schedule, the overall response rate and the mean interresponse time were not altered significantly by most doses of difenamizole, aminopyrine and aspirin given, however, food reinforcement was decreased significantly with ingestion of these drugs. Morphine (20 mg/kg, p.o.) shortened the mean interresponse time and increased the response in DRL schedule. These results suggest that the central action of difenamizole is similar to that produced by aminopyrine, but not that produced by morphine.",

    "21": "Chlorodiazepoxide, diazepam and morphine, given alone or in combination, were tested in naive mice subjected to five 100-trial avoidance sessions in the shuttle-box. When given alone before each training session all three drugs improved avoidance behaviour. However, facilitation of avoidance responding was much more evident when either benzodiazepine derivative was given in combination with morphine.", 
    "22": "Seventy patients, submitted to oxygen encephalography and oxygen myelography, were examined by retinal funduscopy to establish the incidence of intraocular haemorrhages, a complication reported to be frequent by other investigators. We did not discover any retinal haemorrhages. Pathogenetic factors influencing intracranial or intraocular venous pressure or both are discussed, particularly the effect due to different technical procedures during the examination, and the type of anaesthesia used.", 
    "23": "Rats were trained to run in a straight alley under conditions of partial or continuous reinforcement. Extinction was slower after partial reinforcement. Chlordiazepoxide, administered during acquisition only, had no effect on acquisition but abolished the partial reinforcement extinction effect. The results support the hypothesis that chlordiazepoxide acts by attenuating the effects of averisive stimuli.", 
    "24": "Experiences and results of 7212 brachial plexus blocks by the supraclavicular and 404 by the axillary approach are reported. The times of onset and duration of several local anesthetics are compared. The incidence of pneumothorax was 0.42% (30 cases) when the supraclavicular approach was used. Therefore the axillary technique is recommended to avoid this serious complication.", 
    "25": "Propranolol alone was more effective than either chlordiazepoxide or a combination of chlordiazepoxide and propranolol in alleviating the symptoms of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "26": "Sixty-one patients received nitrazepam 5 mg by mouth on the night before operation, followed by 2.5 mg given on the morning of operation and were compared with 60 patients who received no premedication. All were undergoing either therapeutic abortion, by dilatation and curettage, or explorative curettage. The plasma concentrations of nitrazepam were determined by gas chromatography and compared with the clinical effects of the drug. The premedicated patients slept better on the night before operation, and were more sedated and less apprehensive. Headache was more frequent following nitrazepam. There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of dizziness and nausea. The unpremedicated patients had a faster average heart rate. There was no obvious relationship between the plasma concentration of nitrazepam and the quality of sleep, degree of sedation, apprehension, excitement or headache.", 
    "27": "It has been found that seduxen at a dose of 5-10 mg/kg/day administered in different ways to hypokinetic animals does not prevent hypoxic developments in the myocardium and the femoral muscle or does not normalize hypokinesia-induced biochemical changes in the liver. These findings make the advisability of seduxen application during hypokinesia doubtful.", 
    "28": "1. Behavioural activity (delayed differentiation and spatial delayed alternation) and pharmacokinetics of diazepam and its metabolites, N-desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam), 3-hydroxydiazepam (temazepam) and 3-hydroxy-N-desmethyldiazepam (oxazepam), and of dipotassium clorazepate (clorazepate), were studied in the monkey (Macaca mulatta). Diazepam and its metabolites (1.8 and 3.0 mg/kg) and clorazepate (2.6 and 4.3 mg/kg) were given by intraperitoneal injection. 2. Hydroxylation of diazepam (temazepam and oxazepam) led to a loss of, or a considerable reduction in, behavioural activity, whereas activity was preserved, though modified, by demethylation (nordiazepam). It was not possible to establish change in behaviour at specific time intervals after clorazepate, but combined performance data revealed an effect. 3. The maximum mean plasma concentrations of diazepam, temazepam, oxazepam and clorazepate were observed at 0.5 h, and the maximum mean plasma concentration of nordiazepam was observed at 1 hour. Plasma concentrations of nordiazepam were the highest and decreased monoexponentially. Plasma concenqrations of the other drugs declined rapidly at first but more slowly later, and these data were analysed as biexponential models. In the analysis for metabolites, nordiazepam reached measurable levels after the injection of diazepam and clorazepate. 4. It is suggested that differences in the effects of closely related benzodiazepines may not be due solely to their plasma pharmacokinetic properties, but may arise from differences in their intrinsic activity.", 
    "29": "A double-blind clinical trial of phenelzine and diazepam against placebo and diazepam in neurotic patients over a four-week period showed phenelzine to be superior to placebo on three rating scales in some groups of patients who completed the trial. The findings suggest that phenelzine may exert a beneficial effect on some as yet undefined features of anxiety and depression which were not revealed by a multiple regression analysis of clinical symptomatology or premorbid personality.", 
    "30": "In 87 children aged 2-9 yr, oral droperidol and oral droperidol plus diazepam were compared as premedicants in a controlled double-blind clinical trial. Atropine was given orally to all the patients. Droperidol was well absorbed and produced good sedation, associated with a low incidence of vomiting after operation. Droperidol plus diazepam did not appear to offer any advantage over droperidol alone. Anxiety and extrapyramidal effects were not observed and may have been obviated by the addition of atropine. Droperidol syrup was noted to be more palatable than other oral premedicants in use.", 
    "31": "A rapid method was developed for the determination of diazepam and nordiazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam) in human plasma using electron capture gas--liquid chromatography (GLC--ECE). The concentration of diazepam and nordiazepam is determined using 0.5 ml of plasma extracted with 1.0 ml of benzene containing 25 ng/ml of methylnitrazepam as the internal standard. The benzene extract is removed and an aliquot is subjected to automated GLC-ECD analysis. The method has a sensitivity limit of 5 ng diazepam and 10ng nordiazepam per milliliter of plasma. The method was used to determine the plasma levels in man following the first 5-mg diazepam dose, as well as during chronic oral administration of 5 mg diazepam three times daily and 15 mg diazepam once a day.", 
    "32": "The effect of clonazepam on a behavioral model of increased whole brain serotonin activity was investigated. While clonazepam induces a moderate elevation of whole brain serotonin, the drug fails to potentiate or inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced stereotypy in young guinea pigs. These results suggest that despite drug induced alterations in serotonin concentration clonazepam does not hava an effect on the physiologic activity of serotonin and may not exert its pharmacologic activity by influencing serotonin within the brain.", 
    "33": "The histories of seven consecutive cases of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome are presented to exemplify the range of clinical manifestations in this disease and to collate preliminary results with the new benzodiazepine, clonazepam, as possible adjuvant therapy of this disorder. Controlled trials with clonazepam alone and in association with haloperidol are now justified. Five of our 7 patients had a positive family history of tics, and 2 a confirmed family history of gout. Because clonazepam improves myoclonia and tics and because its mechanism of action possibly involves serotonin, we thought it worthwhile to study simultaneously the relative roles of serotonin and dopamine metabolism in the production of tics, and their relationship to possible defects in purine metabolism in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome.", 
    "34": "Unilateral stereotaxic injections of 1 microgram of the soluble benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride into the predominantly GABA-containing zona reticulata of the substantia nigra of amphetamine-pretreated rats induced rotational behaviour similar to that seen following unilateral elevation of nigral GABA levels and amphetamine treatment; this effect was not seen following injections into the vicinity of the predominantly dopamine-containing zona compacta. Chlordiazepoxide-induced rotations were abolished by the GABA-antagonist picrotoxin. Both chlordiazepoxide and GABA depressed production of cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate in samples of nigral tissue in vitro as estimated by radioimmunoassay. It is concluded that chlordiazepoxide may enhance GABA transmission within the substantia nigra, by some as yet unidentified mechanism, to create asymmetric activity in GABA-modulated neurones and hence induce rotation.", 
    "35": "Effects of benzodiapines administered by the intraperitoneal route on PGO firings and multiple unit activity in the midbrain reticular formation in chronic cat preparations were investigated at various levels of consciousness. Changes in the sleep-wakefulness cycle induced by direct injection of benzodiazepines into the reticular formation were also investigated. Benzodiazepines markedly decreased multiple unit activity in the midbrain reticular formation during each stage of sleep, but had little effect during behavioral and EEG arousal. Benzodiazepines did not affect PGO firing rate, but attenuated all increase of multiple unit activity following PGO firings. The bilateral injection of benzodiazepines into the midbrain reticular formation induced an increase of arousal and a decrease of slow wave sleep, but did not change the amount of paradoxical sleep. It is concluded that benzodiazepines show a mixture of depressant and facilitatory effects, which seem to vary with the state of consciousness of the animal.", 
    "36": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of flurazepam were investigated in unanesthetized, unrestrained rabbits with chronic electrode implants and compared with those of diazepam. Flurazepam, at doses of 0.5 approximately 5 mg/kg i.v., induced a drowsy EEG pattern, i.e. high voltage slow waves in the cortex and amygdaloid complex and desynchronization of the hippocampal theta waves. In addition, low voltage fast waves were superimposed, especially on the cortical EEG. Flurazepam suppressed the EEG arousal responses induced not only by auditory stimulation but also by electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus. The EEG arousal response induced by i.v. injection of physostigmine was suppressed by flurazepam. Flurazepam depressed the photic driving response and the augmenting response. The recruiting response was slightly enhanced by flurazepam. The limbic afterdischarges elicited by either hippocampal or amygdaloid stimulation were suppressed by flurazepam. Flurazepam caused reductions of pressor responses to stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and the mesencephalic reticular formation in anaesthetized rabbits. There was little or no effect on pressor responses to the injection of noradrenaline, carotid artery occulusion and asphyxia with flurazepam. In general, these effects of flurazepam were similar to those of diazepam, but the drug induced actions which differed from those of diazepam.", 
    "37": "Repeated doses of 5 mg nitrazepam, 15 mg flurazepam, and 1 mg flunitrazepam improved subjective assessments of the ease of getting to sleep and the perceived quality of induced sleep in a population of 30 healthy volunteers. The subjective reports of improved sleep inducement were related to a perceived difficulty in awakening from sleep the morning following medication. This subjectively reported \"hangover\" is also shown in the impairment of mental arithmetic abilities as measured on the serial subtraction of sevens technique. However, complex psychomotor performance is unaffected by repeated administration of these three benzodiazepine derivatives, although these later results are somewhat equivocal. Evidence of a \"rebound phenomenon\" following 4 nights' withdrawal of active medication is shown in both subjective and objective measures of sleep and early morning behaviour.", 
    "38": "A rapid procedure for the measurement of serum diazepam (D), N-desmethyldiazepam (ND), and N-desalkylflurazepam (NF), levels in clinical samples is described. The single step extraction procedure yields quantitative extraction for the drugs mentioned above. No solvent evaporation step is needed. No interference of endogenous substances or generally used psychotropic drugs containing halogen atoms has been observed. The conditions provide excellent precision, due to a clear separation of the internal standard, medazepam, from the solvent front. The frequency response electron capture detector provides a linear response to the drugs over a 5 X 10(2) concentration range making serial dilution of the samples unnecessary. The automatic data reduction system indicates the serum levels directly in ng/ml without manual calculations.", 
    "39": "Insomnia and anxiety decreased in 12 outpatients taking triazolam following alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "40": "Disposition of triazolam (T), a new, potent, hypnotic agent, was studied in the dog. A single 0.5-mg/kg oral or iv dose of 14C-labeled T was rapidly absorbed, and although 88% was bound to serum proteins, T levels decreased with a half-life of 0.85 hr. Metabolism of T was rapid, with a first-pass effect observed after oral administration. Excretion of drug-related materials was rapid; urinary and fecal excretion of 14C were equal. Urine contained no measurable T, and metabolites were mostly conjugated. The major urinary metabolite was the alpha-HT analog of T, resulting from oxidation of the 1-methyl group of the triazole moiety. Other metabolites identified were the 4-hydroxy and alpha,4-hHT analogs of T, as well as the 1-demethyl analog, which probably results from further oxidation of alpha-hydroxy-T. Evidence also was obtained for two other monohydroxy analogs plus a dihydroxy, monohydroxymonomethoxy, and a dihydroxymonomethoxy analog of triazolam.", 
    "41": "In the acute phase, management begins with ruling out conditions that would require hospitalization. Moderate withdrawal symptoms in susceptible patients require substitution medication which can be monitored on an outpatient basis. In the subacute phase, after withdrawal, frequent visits, family education and judicious use of drugs are required. Depressive reactions are common. There are no reliable indexes for predicting the success of a return to controlled drinking.", 
    "42": "After forced intragastric intubation of alcohol, rats will show a greatly increased tendency to self-administer alcohol in a free-choice situation. Diazepam (Valium) dosage (5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) during the period ow withdrawal serves to maintain undiminished such alcohol self-administration. Without such diazepam dosage the tendency to self-administer alcohol returns to control levels.", 
    "43": "Doxepin (Quitaxon) at doses of 25, 50, and 75 mg was compared with diazepam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg, using as variables the percentage lowering of Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF) and the self-estimated degree of drowsiness. Single doses were given, and repeated effect determinations were made over 6 h. Clear dose-effect relations could be demonstrated. The two drugs differed in speed and duration of action and in steepness of effect increase with dose. Although there were good correlations between CFF effect and subjective drowsiness, it seemed that the two methods interrelated somewhat differently in the different types of drug. CFF was a more stable and reliable method than the subjective estimation of drowsiness. However, when comparing drugs belonging to different classes, both methods preferably should be used together.", 
    "44": "Rats were kept on a 12-h light-dark cycle. One hour after the light was switched on, physiological saline, (+)-amphetamine 1 mg/kg, and H 77/77 5 mg/kg were injected s.c.; the number of groomings was counted 1-2 h after the treatments. (+)-Amphetamine and H 77/77 produced increased grooming which was antagonized by the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor H 44/68 (250 mg/kg), the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor FLA 63 (40), the neuroleptics haloperidol (0.1 and 0.5), and clozapine (1 and 5). The (+)-amphetamine-induced grooming was also antagonized by the NA-receptor blocker aceperone (10) but not by the sedative phenothiazines mepazine (10) and diphenhydramine (20) nor diazepam (1). These results indicate that NA-release is involved in the mediation of (+)-amphetamine- and H 77/77-induced grooming. The inhibition of haloperidol and clozapine is presumably due to NA-receptor blockade.", 
    "45": "Two groups of anxious patients were treated with either clorazepate (n = 27, 15 mg at night), or diazepam (n = 27, 5 mg three times a day), and the anxiolytic effects of the treatments compared during a 22 day period. Both drugs were effective antianxiety agents (as assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Analogue and Rapid Symptom Check List scales). The response to drug treatment did not differ according to the type of anxiety--psychological or somatic. No significant difference was observed between the two drug treatments. Separation of patients according to their anxiety type did not change this finding. Clorazepate, when administered as a single dose at night, is an effective short term anxiolytic.", 
    "46": "The nocturnal sleep of eight healthy young volunteers was studied after placebo, Fosazepam 100 mg and Nitrazepam 10 mg. Overall results were very similar after the two drugs. During drug periods there was less of sleep Stages I, III + IV and REM, compensated by an increase in Stage II. The decrease in SWS (III + IV) persisted during the withdrawal periods. There was also an increase in Stage I during Fosazepam withdrawal, whereas the percentage of other sleep stages returned to normal. Sleep quality was reported to be slightly better and morning drowsiness, as well as hangover effects, were said to be less pronounced after Fosazepam than after Nitrazepam.", 
    "47": "The effects of two diazepines (diazepam and Ro 11-7800) and 3 barbiturates (thiamylal, pentobarbitol and phenobarbital) on GABA-mediated recurrent inhibition were assessed on single hippocampal pyramidal cells and on population spikes using extracellular recording techniques. Recurrent inhibition was evoked in spontaneously active CA1 pyramidal cells by stimulation of the fimbria or the alveus with single shocks. Microiontophoretic application of Ro 11-7800 or systemic application of diazepines or barbiturates resulted in an increase of the duration of the inhibition and in a concomitant depression of the spontaneous firing in most neurones tested. When the firing rates were kept constant artificially, using excitant amino acids, a prolongation of the recurrent inhibition was observed with barbiturates but not with diazepines. The duration of the inhibition, which was assessed from CA1 population spikes elicited by double shocks to the fimbria, was prolonged following systemic application of diazepines or barbiturates. It is concluded that both diazepines and barbiturates are able to potentiate GABAergic recurrent inhibition in the hippocampus. The demonstration of this effect appears to depend critically on certain experimental conditions."
