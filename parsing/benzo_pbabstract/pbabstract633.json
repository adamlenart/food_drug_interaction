    "0": "Midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, was administered as: i) 5 mg intravenously, ii) a 10-mg oral solution and iii) a 10-mg oral tablet, to six volunteers whose informed consent had been obtained. Midazolam plasma concentrations were measured using an electron-capture gas-liquid chromatographic assay. After 5-mg intravenous midazolam, subjects fell asleep within 1-2 min and continued to sleep for an average of 1.33 h. After oral midazolam intake (solution or tablets), drowsiness appeared after a average of 0.38 h (range 0.25-0.55 h) and sleep continued for an average of 1.17 h. The time to reach peak plasma midazolam concentration after the 10-mg solution dose (0.37 +/- 0.45 h) did not differ significantly ('t' = 2.04, df = 10, p greater than 0.05) from the time to reach peak plasma midazolam level after the 10-mg tablet dose (0.74 +/- 0.45 h). The terminal half-life, (t 1/2), of midazolam in plasma was 1.77 +/- 0.83 h and there was no significant difference between the mean terminal half-life values obtained for the three midazolam formulations. The mean total clearance (Cl), of midazolam after 5-mg intravenous administration was 0.383 +/- 0.0941 . kg-1 . h-1. The first pass effect, F, determined experimentally (0.36 +/- 0.09) indicated the substantial first pass metabolism of midazolam. The percentage of the midazolam dose excreted unchanged in urine in four subjects during the 0-8-h urine collection interval was very small (0.011%-0.028%).", 
    "1": "It has been established in experiments on mice and rats that sydnocarb, strychnine, corasol and thiosemicarbazide are correctors as regards the myorelaxant effect of phenazepam. The correcting effect of the drugs manifests to a greater degree under conditions of eliminating the side effects that developed. Electroencephalographic studies on the combined action of phenazepam and sydnocarb on the sleep cycles in rats have shown sydnocarb to reduce the hypnotic effect of the tranquilizer. Under conflict situation sydnocarb or strychnine exert no effect on the tranquilizing action of phenazepam. Conversely, corasol and thiosemicarbazide diminish the anxiolytic effect of the tranquilizer. The data obtained allowed one to recommend that sydnocarb and strychnine be introduced in medical practice as correctors of the side effects produced by phenazepam.", 
    "2": "As with most psychotropic sedative drugs, the potential for withdrawal reactions is present with the benzodiazepines (19). Signs suggesting the potential for withdrawal reactions can be gleaned from the clinical course of events such as the development of tolerance anc psychological and physiological dependence. If high doses are reached, the risk of withdrawal reactions increases with the length of treatment and the abruptness of cessation. The long-acting benzodiazepines have a built-in mechanism against withdrawal reactions through their active metabolites. Abrupt cessation of drug therapy in high-dose patients should be avoided to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions.", 
    "3": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors have been solubilized and purified by procedures such as gel filtration, ion-exchange, lectin, and affinity chromatographies. All of these procedures enhance the specific activity of each receptor to a similar extent. The drug specificities of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites are the same after extensive purification by affinity chromatography compared to the membrane bound and initially solubilized receptors. GABA and chloride stimulation of benzodiazepine binding is retained in pure receptors. Two bands are covalently labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam after ultraviolet irradiation of the purified receptor. The persistent association of GABA, benzodiazepine, and chloride recognition sites after extensive purification suggests that they may be part of a single macromolecular complex.", 
    "4": "Benzodiazepine receptors can be visualized in regions of synaptic contact by electron microscopic autoradiography using [3H]flunitrazepam as a photoaffinity label in fresh brain tissue. Perfusion fixation of the tissue prior to photoaffinity labeling left the ligand binding characteristics and the light and electron microscopic distribution of benzodiazepine receptors unaltered. Therefore, the immunocytochemical localization of a neuronal marker in fixed tissue could be combined with photoaffinity labeling in order to identify the types of synapses containing benzodiazepine receptors. By using antiserum to glutamate decarboxylase, a marker of gamma-aminobutyrergic neurons, one-third of the photolabeled benzodiazepine receptors were found to be associated with immunocytochemically stained nerve endings. Thus, these synapses are the site of at lest some benzodiazepine receptors. The enhancement of gamma-aminobutyrergic synaptic transmission by benzodiazepines, shown electrophysiologically, appears to be a primary mechanism of action of this group of drugs.", 
    "5": "A long existing hypothesis, i.e. that the EEG effects, in lead O2A2, of typical psychotropic drugs are substance class specific, when given as single oral dosages to healthy volunteers, is discussed. Using the technique of pharmacoelectroencephalograhpy, five typical representatives of neuroleptics, anxiolytics, antidepressives, psychostimulants (Fig. 2) as well as placebo were investigated in 75 volunteers, each receiving one representative of each substance class in a double blind 5-fach change over latin square design (Fig. 3). A five minute EEG record for lead O2A2 was obtained pre, 1 h and 3 hrs post drug intake unter RR (Relaxed Recording) conditions. Typical samples of th EEG records are shown in Figs. 4--7. Parametrisation was done using power spectrum analysis. Then 3 x 7 target variables were formed--six relative power values in predetermined frequency bands and the total power between 1.5 and 30.0 Hz for 3 occasions of measurement (Fig. 4--7). Using a (five-group) linear discriminant analysis the substance effects on the EEG were transformed into 5 probability measures for the five substance classes (Fig. 4--7). The present paper should provide a demonstration of some typical examples, using single subjects, of the projection of substance effects onto an electrophysiological level using a vector of 21 components (7 target variables for 3 occasions of measurement) as can be seen from Table 1. Furthermore, the transformation into probability measures of the five substance classes are shown in Table 2. Table 3 shows five examples of projections of substance effects, which do not fit into the classifications to which they belong. An attempt is made to explain, whether single target variables from the power spectrum can contribute differently to the discrimination between single substances of different substance classes. Within the accepted system of 4 psychotropic drug classes, the following variables seem to be of importance: a) The benzodiazepine anxiolytics show a marked increase in beta F1 (12.0--18.0 Hz) power and activity and, related to sedation, an increase in delta F-power and a decrease in alpha-power; b) The psychostimulants of the amphetamine type show an increase in total power and alpha-power, an increase in the power of the frequency ranges near to the alpha-band (slow beta, fast theta) and a decrease in delta F (1.5--5.5 Hz)-power, when delta F-power is high in the pre-values, indicating a stabilization in vigilance; c) The neuroleptics show a marked increase in theta F (5.5--8.5 Hz)-power, some increase in the delta F--and a decrease in the beta F1-and beta F3-power; d) Tricyclic antidepressants show an interaction between delta F-theta F-, alpha- and beta-power, in the sense of a dissociative shift in vigilance.", 
    "6": "The demonstration of specific recognition sites for benzodiazepines in the mammalian CNS has altered current thinking on the mechanisms of action of the benzodiazepines as well as the neurochemical events which are associated with anxiety. Recent studies suggest that the physiological regulation of the benzodiazepine receptor is far more complex than initially believed and includes a functional coupling to both a GABA receptor and an associated chloride ionophore. It now appears that a number of other psychopharmacologic agents, including minor tranquilizers other than the benzodiazepines as well as several convulsants and anticonvulsants, may exert their pharmacologic effects by affecting one or more regulatory sites on the benzodiazepine receptor complex. In addition to a number of drugs, at least one endogenous small molecular weight compound that has been isolated from the crude synaptosomal fraction of bovine cerebral cortex also appears to modulate this receptor complex.", 
    "7": "Oxazepam and lorazepam are 3-hydroxy benzodiazepine derivatives used as sedatives and anxiolytics. The major metabolic pathway for both compounds involves conjugation to glucuronic acid at the 3-position, followed by urinary excretion of the inactive glucuronide metabolite. Oxazepam has been administered to humans by the oral route only. Usual ranges for kinetic parameters are: elimination half-life, 5 to 15 hours; volume of distribution, 0.6 to 2.0 L/kg; clearance, 0.9 to 2.0 ml/min/kg. Age and liver disease have a minimal influence on oxazepam kinetics, but renal disease is associated with a prolonged half-life and increased volume of distribution. Typical kinetic values for lorazepam are: elimination half-life, 8 to 25 hours; volume of distribution, 1.0 to 1.3 L/kg; clearance, 0.7 to 1.2 ml/min/kg. Lorazepam clearance is somewhat reduced in old age, but liver disease has a minimal effect on clearance. Oral and intramuscular lorazepam are rapidly absorbed, with systemic availability averaging 90% or more. Both oxazepam and lorazepam are extensively bound to plasma protein, but the free fraction for lorazepam (8 to 12%) is greater than that for oxazepam (2 to 4%).", 
    "8": "A gas-liquid chromatographic procedure (GLC) is described for the determination of clonazepam in plasma. The drug is extracted from buffered plasma at pH 9.0 with diethyl ether and then back-extracted into 6 N hydrochloric acid-6N sulfuric acid (95:5) and hydrolyzed at 100 degrees C to convert the drug into its benzophenone derivative. The benzophenone derivative of flurazepam is added to plasma as an internal reference standard. Drug derivatives are finally extracted from the neutralized aqueous phase and assayed by GLC. The present procedure makes use of a nitrogen-sensitive detector which is more stable and selective than the commonly employed electron-capture procedure. The sensitivity of the detector for clonazepam is 1 ng/ml.", 
    "9": "High-performance liquid chromatographic separation prior to reductive electrochemical determination at its dropping mercury electrode imparts specificity and sensitivity not attainable by conventional polarographic analysis of drugs and their metabolites. The utility of this novel approach is demonstrated by the analysis of chlordiazepoxide and its N-desmethyl metabolite in plasma which previously required thin-layer chromatographic separation prior to polarographic measurement. A mobile phase of methanol-isopropanol--0.0075 M acetate buffer, pH 3.5 (53:5:42), is used with the detector operated in the differential pulse mode at Ep = -0.820 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The response was linear (r = 0.998) in the concentration range of 0.05--2.0 micrograms/ml plasma for each component. The minimum detectability for each component under these conditions is 5.0 ng injected at a current range of 0.5 microamperemeter full scale. Techniques for oxygen removal and hydrodynamic consideration for the pumping system are presented.", 
    "10": "Inosine, 2-deoxyinosine, and 2-deoxyguanosine completely reversed the increase in exploratory activity elicited in mice by diazepam. The inhibition of exploratory behavior by purines occurred at doses that when given alone have no effect on exploratory behavior. 7-Methylinosine, which does not bind to the brain benzodiazepine binding site in vitro, had no effect on the diazepam-induced increase in exploratory behavior. Behavioral effects produced by various combinations of inosine and diazepam indicate that the interaction between purine and benzodiazepine is antagonistic and support the hypothesis that the naturally occurring purines function in anxiety-related behaviors that respond to benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "11": "We examined whether serotonin (5-HT)-containing neurons of the midbrain raphe nuclei are subject to an inhibitory control by GABA. We found that injection into the median raphe nucleus of the GABA antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline and the GABA agonist muscimol increase and decrease, respectively, the 5-HT turnover and the steady-state content of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The results provide evidence of a tonic inhibition by GABA of 5-HT neuronal activity in the median raphe nucleus; this inhibitory effect is potentiated by benzodiazepines.", 
    "12": "Benzodiazepine receptors are present in high concentration in the chick retina. Their pharmacological properties are similar to those of the benzodiazepine receptors present in the brain. The retina receptors appear prior to, as well as during, the period of synaptogenesis. In the newborn chick retina the receptors are localized in the inner synaptic layer, probably on or close to synaptic connections.", 
    "13": "Experience in urinary drug screening at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, was evaluated over a period of 12 months after the introduction of a commercially available thin-layer chromatographic system which expanded the capabilities and improved the efficiency of the service. Specimens from 167 patients were screened when either drug overdose, or drug abuse, or poor compliance with prescribed medications was suspected. Screening was also undertaken to aid solution of diagnostic problems by excluding the possibility of drug ingestion. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and tricyclic antidepressants represented the drug groups which were most frequently detected. Multiple drug use was common with the mode and median number of drugs taken being two. For 75% of the patients studied, relevant information about drug intake was either unreliable or not obtainable before drug screening. Retrospective examination of the case histories showed that drug screening assisted in arriving at diagnostic or management decisions for at least 66% of the patients.", 
    "14": "A questionnaire designed to evaluate the effect of patient characteristics and clinician attitudes on the prescribing of benzodiazepines was distributed to 86 members of the Departments of Psychiatry and Family Practice; the return rate was 87%. Of the respondents, 30% were consistently for, 20% were consistently against, and 50% were neither consistently for nor against the use of benzodiazepines. Prescribing decisions apparently depended on a complex interaction of patient's sex, employment, symptom severity and chronicity, and the respondent's attitude about the drugs. Plans are under way to revise the questionnaire, undertake in depth interviews, and compare questionnaire data with actual prescribing practices.", 
    "15": "Tic douloureux (trigerminal neuralgia) usually has its onset in the sixth or seventh decade and is characterized by severe, excruciating facial pain which is almost always unilateral. The mandibular division and the maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve are most commonly affected. Carbamazepine is the drug of choice. Currently popular surgical procedures include decompression of the fifth cranial nerve and percutaneous thermal lesioning of the gasserian ganglion.", 
    "16": "From 3,548 drug overdose or abuse cases presenting at 21 Metropolitan Toronto hospitals' Emergency departments, data concerning demographic and medical characteristics, investigative and management procedures, drug analysis services, and disposition of patients were collected. Of the 3,548 cases, 2,723 (77%) were acute overdose and 816 (23%) were drug abuse. Drug overdose was more common than drug abuse for both sexes, but was more characteristic of females. The drugs most frequently alleged ingested were benzodiazepines (34%), ethanol (32%), salicylates (16%), and barbiturates (14%). The frequency with which particular classes of drugs are alleged in overdose corresponds closely to the frequency of prescribing these drugs in Ontario.", 
    "17": "This pilot study examined patients' perceptions of, and attitudes towards, psychotropic drug-taking. Fifty chronic users of benzodiazepines in two Middlesex group practices were interviewed, and data were collected on their knowledge, experience and expectations of these drugs.The data suggest that psychotropic drug-taking has become an important part of many patients' self-image and of their social relationships, and that these factors should be taken into account when dealing with psychological dependence on psychotropic drugs.", 
    "18": "Transtracheal aspiration (TTA) was performed 35 times in 33 patients with acute pulmonary infections. The indications for the procedure included pulmonary infection in immune-depressed or debilitated patients in whom the pathogenic organism could not be identified, either because of lack of sputum or suspected over-colonization of the oral cavity. The procedure was performed under full sedation with diazepam (Valium), by introducing a catheter (Intracath) through the cricothyroid membrane into the trachea, without local anesthesia. This modification markedly reduces the cough reflex and complications like subcutaneous emphysema and bleeding. Only two of our cases developed subcutaneous emphysema. The procedure enables the physician to make accurate and rapid therapeutic decisions and is recommended as a diagnostic tool.", 
    "19": "A case of hydroxyzine toxicity following accidental ingestion in a 13-month old female infant has been presented. A plasma hydroxyzine concentration 8.5 hours after the acute ingestion was 102.7 micrograms/ml and toxicity was manifested primarily by generalized seizures and sinus tachycardia. General supportive care and seizure control with physostigmine resulted in complete recovery within 72 hours. This case represents the first documented report of hydroxyzine toxicity following acute ingestion in a child.", 
    "20": "The loss of isosorbide dinitrate from aqueous solutions stored in plastic infusion bags and/or infused through plastic giving sets was investigated. During simulated infusions, the loss of isosorbide dinitrate was found to be flow-rate dependent. The clinical and pharmacokinetic significance of this loss is discussed. Infusion o isosorbide dinitrate from a glass syringe through high density polyethylene tubing overcame the loss associated with its administration via plastic infusion bags and intravenous giving sets. This method was also applied successfully to minimise the previously reported loss of diazepam and chlormethiazole during infusions.", 
    "21": "The solubility of diazepam was investigated to determine compatibility limits for diluting diazepam injection in four large-volume parenteral (LVP) solutions. A solution of diazepam powder (15 mg/ml) in absolute alcohol and of the commercially available diazepam injection (5 mg/ml) were used in the study. Either 1.0 ml of the alcoholic solution or 3.0 ml of the commercial injection were added to 50 ml of the LVPs studied-sterile water for injection (WFI), 5% dextrose injection, 0.9% sodium chloride injection, and lactated Ringer's injection. Diazepam was assayed sprectrophotometrically at 367 nm. The solubility of diazepam in WFI was 0.041 mg/ml after equilibration for 24 hours at 25 degrees C. The solubility of diazepam in the LVPs ranged from 0.04 to 0.05 mg/ml at 25 degrees C. The effects of solution dielectric constants on nonelectrolyte solubility and the minimal fraction of protonated (ionized) diazepam present in typical admixtures are deduced to be negligible determinants of diazepam solubility in i.v. solutions at pH greater than or equal to 5.4 prepared from greater than or equal to 1:10 volume dilutions of diazepam injection. The aqueous solubility data for diazepam corroborate other reported values and are tantamount to recommending against less than a 1:100 volume dilution of diazepam injection when compounding i.v. admixtures.", 
    "22": "In the present investigation, the neuropharmacology of 1,3 butanediol (1,3-BD) was compared with that of ethanol. Acute i.p. administration of equimolar doses of 1,3-BD or ethanol to rats impaired the aerial righting reflex, attenuated the suppressive effect of punishment on drinking behavior, lowered blood pressure, caused a concomitant reduction in the content of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the cerebellum and reduced ethanol withdrawal reactions. Although these data suggested that ethanol and 2,3-BD were of similar potency, the brain content of 1,3-BD was only 33% of that of ethanol after treatment with equimolar doses, suggesting a greater central nervous system (CNS) potency for 1,3-BD. In rats treated chronically with ethanol to produce physical dependence, 1,3-BD was more potent than ethanol in inhibiting the hyperexcitability observed upon ethanol withdrawal. Furthermore, chronic administration and withdrawal of 1,3-BD caused CNS hyperexcitability in rats that was characteristic of physical dependence. Despite these similarities, there were clear differences in the actions of ethanol and 1,3-BD. In mice, locomotor stimulation caused by ethanol was not observed after 1,3-BD. Furthermore, while 1,3-BD did not alter the concentration of luteinizing hormone in plasma, equivalent doses of ethanol markedly reduced the concentration of this hormone. These data indicate that like ethanol, 1,3-BD depresses CNS activity and induces physical dependence, but has less effect on plasma luteinizing hormone concentration than ethanol.", 
    "23": "105 patients were given diazepam-fentanyl anaesthesia and the respiratory values were studied spirometrically before the operation, after intramuscular premedication and postoperatively (i.e. after additional doses of diazepam during induction). The occurrence of respiratory depression which has been reported by some authors was confirmed. Blood gas analyses performed in 79 patients during the recovery period showed a significant improvement after the patients had been made to breathe deeply for five minutes. The results confirm the observations made in more than 12000 patients who had this type of anaesthesia that they must be kept under surveillance during the first 30-40 minutes in the recovery ward, but can then be returned to the ward.", 
    "24": "Behavioral reaction times and both auditory and visual absolute thresholds were determined in baboons before and after the administration of stimulant and depressant drugs of abuse. Pentobarbital and diazepam increased reaction times and elevated the visual threshold in a dose-dependent manner. Diazepam also raised the auditory threshold though pentobarbital did not. Chlordiazepoxide affected neither sensory thresholds nor reaction times over the same dose range; d-methylamphetamine elevated the visual threshold, but did not elevate the auditory threshold or increase reaction times.", 
    "25": "Previous work of the authors established a parallelism between gastric mucosa carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity and the values of acid secretion. It was shown that histamine (Ht) is a physiological activator of CA, and that there could be histaminic H2 receptors located on the molecule of CA. Pirenzepine (GZ) is a drug recently introduced in the therapy of gastroduodenal ulcer (GDU). Although its effect of decreasing acid secretion is clinically known, its mechanism of action remains uncertain. Original investigations are presented proving by in vitro and in vivo experiments on pure CA and on CA from human red blood cells and gastric mucosa that GZ is a strong inhibitor of CA. In this concept, GZ may be considered both an enzymatic inhibitor and an antagonist of histaminic H2 receptors.", 
    "26": "A 22-year-old woman with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome developed serial apnoeic-tonic seizures with concomitant bursts of repetitive spikes at 16-20/sec, after receiving therapeutic doses of chlormethiazole, clonazepam, and diazepam for the treatment of serial tonic-clonic generalized seizures. There was a direct relationship between dose of chlormethiazole and frequency of apnoeic-tonic seizures. Since these tonic seizures have been noted during natural sleep and after sleep induced by various sedative drugs in patients with slow spike-wave in EEG, it is likely that the reduction in level of consciousness induced by sedative drugs is the causative factor.", 
    "27": "Although anticonvulsant polytherapy has been widely and traditionally used in the treatment of epilepsy, there is little evidence of its advantages over monotherapy. It does, however, lead to problems of chronic toxicity, drug interactions, failure to evaluate individual drugs, and sometimes exacerbation of seizures. There are many causes of polytherapy which could be avoided by more careful monitoring and supervision of therapy. Studies in new, previously untreated referrals suggest there is considerable potential for monotherapy. In the event of failure of optimum monotherapy, the value of polytherapy is not yet clear. In chronic patients on polytherapy there may be scope for careful rationalization to two or sometimes one drug, with reduction in chronic toxicity and sometimes improved seizure control. Reduction of therapy, however, may be impossible or hazardous due to withdrawal seizures. Even after successful reduction, seizure control is much less satisfactory than in new referrals. It is easier to avoid polytherapy than to reduce it. There is a need to define more carefully the limits of effective anticonvulsant therapy.", 
    "28": "Two types of benzodiazepine binding sites for [3H]diazepam in mammalian central nervous tissue were identified using selective in vitro tissue culture and in situ kainic acid lesion techniques. These two binding sites were pharmacologically distinguished by differential displacement of the [3H]diazepam radioligand using the centrally active benzodiazepine, clonazepam, and the centrally inactive benzodiazepine, RO5-4864. Clonazepam-displaceable binding sites were found to be located principally on neuronal membranes, while RO5-4864-displaceable binding sites were found to be located on non-neuronal elements. These pharmacological distinctions can be used to characterize the predominant cell types which bind benzodiazepines in nervous tissue. It is suggested that one quantitative measure of different cell populations is the ratio of clonazepam- to RO5-4864-displaceable [3H]diazepam binding within a single neuronal tissue simple.", 
    "29": "Benzodiazepine receptor binding studies have been reported suggesting the existence of at least two different benzodiazepine receptors. One distinguishing feature of these two sites is that one has a high affinity for triazolopyridazines, whereas the other has a low affinity. In this study, the regional localization of the two different receptors was examined by light microscopic radiohistochemical methods. [3H]Flunitrazepam was used to label all types of benzodiazepine receptors in slide-mounted tissue sections. CL218,872, a typical triazolopyridazine, was used to preferentially displace [3H]flunitrazepam from the subclass of receptors having a high affinity for CL218,872. Autoradiographs clearly showed that receptor binding in some regions was substantially affected by CL218,872 while that in other regions was affected to a lesser degree. Areas with receptors with high affinity for the triazolopyridazine (Type 1 receptors) included the cerebellum, globus pallidus and parts of the cerebral cortex. Areas with receptors having low affinity for the drugs (Type 2 receptors) included the superficial layer of the superior colliculus, the caudate-putamen and parts of the dentate gyrus. The results of this study may help explain the physiological differences between the benzodiazepine and triazolopyridazine drugs and should point out target sites in the brain for additional studies of the apparently two different receptors.", 
    "30": "A patient representing with palatal myoclonus was diagnosed as suffering from possible multiple sclerosis. A reduction of cerebrospinal 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid suggested a decreased central serotonergic turnover. A therapeutic trial with clonazepam, a serotonergic agonist, improved the myoclonus symptomatically. The possible involvement of serotonergic inhibitory systems in the expression of palatal myoclonus is discussed.", 
    "31": "Mequitazine is a new phenothiazine derivative with potent antihistaminic activity developed by Pharmuka, Co. Ltd., in France. Although the action of this drug on central nervous system is reported to be very weak in the dose range used as antihistaminics, the CNS action cannot be neglected when the huge amount is applied. In order to predict the safety use of this drug in clinical therapy the ability to develop barbital-type physical dependence was investigated. In conclusion, a single dose suppression test and substitution test in barbital dependent mice, and also the primary dependence liability test after repeated administration of the drug in rats revealed that Mequitazine has no physical dependence liability even in the toxic dose.", 
    "32": "Anaesthesia by means of flunitrazepam and paravertebral electrostimulation for a patient with acute intermittent porphyria is described in detail. Based on the relevant literature appropriate safe anaesthetic agents for these cases are listed and the postoperative treatment is discussed. The importance of an adequate supply of fluid, electrolytes and carbohydrates is stressed.", 
    "33": "A double-blind technique was used for studying the psychic and somatic effects of premedication with flunitrazepam, innovar and a placebo in 116 patients. Innovar and the placebo produced the same results. Flunitrazepam reduced anxiety and apprehension and had a significantly higher amnesic effect. Premedication with Innovar increased not only a feeling of fatigue and heaviness but also anxiety and tension in the patients. When assessing the psychic effects of premedication attention must be paid to the subjective impressions on the part of the patient.", 
    "34": "The vast majority of drug deaths in St. Louis City and County through 1977-1979 were of adults who ingested multiple drugs with suicidal intent. In this 3-year survey, seven deaths were due to accidental overdose of ethanol, seven to \"over-the-counter\" products or laboratory reagents, eight from \"classic poisons,\" and only eight to drug abuse. The remaining 117 deaths (80%) resulted from ingestion of legally obtained prescription drugs. Sixty-two percent of all deaths were due to multiple drug administration. Only one child was fatally poisoned. Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ethanol, propoxyphene, and tricyclic antidepressants were the most common agents encountered.", 
    "35": "Based on lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior of the rat in a Skinner box, a \"conflict\" situation was established by combining foot shock punishment with brain stimulation. Diazepam (10-20 mg/kg, PO) caused a marked increase in the lever pressing response in the punished period without affecting the unpunished response. Bromazepam (10--20 mg/kg PO) also caused an increase in the lever pressing response in the punished period and a decrease of the punished response. These results indicate that a \"conflict\" situation based on self-stimulation behavior is useful for the evaluation of antianxiety action.", 
    "36": "10-(Alkylamino)thieno[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepines (3) and 10-(alkylamino)thieno[3,4-b][1,5]benzothiazepines (4) were prepared by derivatization of the respective lactams (7 and 8) via phosphorus pentachloride and subsequent condensation with the appropriate alkylamines. 9-(Alkylamino)-4H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]benzodiazepines (5) were prepared by titanium tetrachloride catalyzed condensation of the lactam 11 with alkylamines. 9-(Alkylamino)-4-methylthieno[3,4-b][1,4]benzodiazepines (6) were prepared by reductive alkylation of 5. The compounds were tested for potential neuroleptic activity by means of the blockade of d-amphetamine lethality in aggregated mice and/or effects on locomotor activity in rats. Antidepressant activity was examined using inhibition of tetrabenazine-induced depression in mice. Most of the title compounds 3-6 were found to have neuroleptic activity. In addition, introduction of a 3-chloro substituent in the oxygen and sulfur systems (3p and 4c), as well as introduction of an N-alkyl in the dinitrogen system (6), was found to produce antidepressant effects. Structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "37": "A GLC procedure was developed for the evaluation of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and flurazepam formulations to USP-NF specifications for drug content, content uniformity, impurities, and identity by retention times and peak areas. The polyimide column, instrument zone temperatures, gas flows, internal standard solution, extraction solvent, and auxiliary equipment were the same for each drug. No derivatization of the samples was required. The GLC assay values (mean of 10 individual dosage units) for diazepam and flurazepam products were in good agreement with the results obtained by the pharmacopeial composite assays. With chlordiazepoxide capsules, when the levels of the two pharmacopeial impurities determined by GLC were added to the GLC assay results (mean of 10), athe aggregate values were consistent wit the drug content results found by the nonspecific USP method. The procedure can be made sensitive to impurity levels of approximately 0.01% for 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone and to approximately 0.2% for 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one 4-oxide. With the equipment used, the estimated potential outputs in lots per working day for a complete quality profile (drug content, content uniformity, purity, and identity) were seven for chlordiazepoxide if no impurity test was required, five if such a test was required, eight for diazepam, and seven for flurazepam.", 
    "38": "At least 10% of the American population medically use prescribed psychopharmacological medications; and such psychotropic medications account for approximately 20% of all prescriptions in this country. Furthermore, there is widespread illicit use of psychoactive drugs, including narcotics, psychostimulants, and central nervous system depressants. All of these agents have potent effects on the cardiovascular system and, in addition, may undergo numerous drug-drug interactions with cardiovascular medications. Givaen the high incidence of both cardiovascular disease and psychoactive drug use in the United States, it is likely that clinicians manage many patients with cardiovascular disease, possibly receiving cardiovascular medications, and also needing psychopharmacological interventions. Consequently, the authors have reviewed the pharmacology of the major classes of psychoactive agents: (I & II) Antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors); (III) Lithium Carbonate; (IV) Major Tranquilizers (phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, butryophenones, reserpine); and (V) Minor Tranquilizers, Sedatives, and Hypnotics (benzodiazepines and barbiturates) with respect to their cardiotoxicity, cardiovascular side effects, and drug-drug interactions. Management of the cardiovascular complications of psychotropic overdose is discussed, as well as potential therapeutic uses of psychopharmacological medications in patients with cardiovascular pathology.", 
    "39": "Benzodiazepines have several advantages over other antidyskinetic drugs in treating tardive dyskinesia. The authors conducted a controlled study of clonazepam versus the active placebo of phenobarbital in 21 psychiatric patients with tardive dyskinesia. Both drugs significantly reduced dyskinetic movements: clonazepam had a stronger effect on orofacial dyskinesia, and phenobarbital was more effective for limbs and axial movements. Clonazepam was also more effective for drug-free patients and those receiving low doses of neuroleptics than for all patients given phenobarbital and for clonazepam patients taking high doses of neuroleptics. The authors suggest that future treatment studies focus on the effects of antidyskinetic drugs on distinct body regions.", 
    "40": "A benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome was demonstrated in this study. It occurred more frequently with use of the short-acting type of benzodiazepine and approximately 26 hours after discontinuing the regular intake of the drug as compared with approximately 4 days after stopping the regular intake of the long-acting type of benzodiazepine. These findings have a special significance in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome, since 30% of alcoholics have been shown to have a regular intake of one of the benzodiazepines and since these are the drugs of choice in the treatment of the syndrome.", 
    "41": "A randomly selected group of alcoholics who reported for treatment was tested for blood alcohol and benzodiazepine values. Only 30% of patients had significantly high alcohol levels, but 20% had concomitant significantly high alcohol and benzodiazepine levels. These factors should be taken into account if pharmacotherapy is to be instituted for similar patients.", 
    "42": "In spinal unanesthetized cats, pyridoxine pretreatment significantly enhanced the diazepam-induced increase in dorsal root potentials and dorsal root reflexes.", 
    "43": "The LD50 of i.p. injected diazepam was determined every 4 h over a 24-h period in albino mice adapted to a 12-h dark/12-h light programmed illumination cycle. Results show that diazepam is more toxic during the light phase of the cycle than during the dark phase and demonstrate circadian variation in the toxicity of the compound in mice.", 
    "44": "Diazepam in a dose of 0.75, 1.25, or 2.5 mg was force-fed to mice during 3 days of oocyte maturation and superovulation induced with pregnant mare's serum and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Twenty-two hours after hCG was administered, rates of fertilization were determined in squash preparations. Increasing doses of diazepam were associated with increasing numbers of degenerated eggs and decreasing rates of fertilization when compared to results in control animals. Chromosome preparations of ova from treated animals confirmed the chromatin degeneracy an failed to document an arrest of maturation of the ova. Correlative serum levels of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were measured in blood obtained 2 hours after the indicated dose.", 
    "45": "Indications for and dosages of four commonly prescribed benzodiazepines were recorded at a family medicine centre with the aid of a computerized data collection system. Four guidelines were then developed for appropriate prescribing of these drugs: (a) benzodiazepines should be used less frequently with increasing age; (b) short-acting drugs are preferable to long-acting drugs; (c) patients 65 years of age and over should receive half the daily dose prescribed for younger patients; and (d) use of these drugs for more than 1 month should be discouraged. After a year's observation it was evident that none of the guidelines were being followed. The 30 physicians in the practice were then informed of the findings by an educational program. Another 6 months of observation showed a reduction in the prescribing of benzodiazepines to patients 65 years of age and over, a significant shift to the use of short-acting benzodiazepines, and some reduction in the daily dose and duration of administration of diazepam. Thus, such a review of drug prescribing in family practice can be a practical and effective method of improving prescribing patterns.", 
    "46": "The 250 patients of this series, whatsoever was the location of the aneurysm, were operated radically on the 6th and 7th day following the rupture. That is to say at the end of the brain swelling period and before the rebleeding period. During these 5 or 6 days the blood pressure was stabilized by a daily intake of diazepam (15 to 30 millig); 10% only of the patients were resistant; in these cases clonidine was used. During this period antifibrinolitic agents were not given as well as antioedematous therapy. No case of rebleeding was observed in this series under this therapy.", 
    "47": "A rapid, sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay was developed for the determination of diazepam, and its major metabolites, oxazepam, temazepam and nordiazepam in plasma, blood, and urine of humans and cats. The assay for the compounds involves extraction into benzene--methylene chloride (90:10) from plasma, blood or urine buffered to pH 9.0. In both species the overall recovery of diazepam and its major metabolites from plasma or blood ranged from 60 +/- 3.2 to 89 +/- 13% (S.D.) and for urine from 79 +/- 7.9 to 93 +/- 10.5% (S.D.). The sensitivity limit of the assay using UV detection at 254 nm was 50 ng/ml of plasma and blood in both species except for human urine (post-Glusulase) which was 200 ng/ml. The HPLC assay was used to monitor the plasma concentration--time profile in humans following a 10-mg oral dose of diazepam and the blood concentration time profile of diazepam and nordiazepam in cats following a 10 mg/kg intravenous dose of either diazepam or nordiazepam. The HPLC assay data correlated well with data generated by an electron-capture--gas--liquid chromatography assay.", 
    "48": "Light microscopic autoradiographical localization of drug and neurotransmitter receptors provides investigators with a tool to determine the sites of drug action with a high degree of anatomical resolution. In the cortex, where there is a distinct laminar organization, the differential distribution of receptors can be determined. We have found that differences in the density of specific receptors exist between layers of the cerebral cortex. Our observations include the localization of muscarinic cholinergic, benzodiazepine, opiate, neurotensin, histamine-H1, alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and high-affinity GABA receptors in the cerebral cortex. Of this list of neurotransmitters only significant concentrations of benzodiazepine, GABA, and beta-adrenergic receptors were found in the cerebellar cortex. Receptor localizations such as these can be coupled with information from immunohistochemical studies to provide the basis for future experimentation in order to define neuro-transmitter-specific pathways in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices.", 
    "49": "One has only to recall that GABA appears to be a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS), that it exerts a hypotensive action upon systemic administration, that it is present in the blood, that its actions are antagonized by bicuculline and picrotoxin and facilitated by benzodiazepines, and that receptors for GABA exist in cerebral blood vessels, to consider that GABA is somehow involved in cardiovascular regulation. One might even postulate that influences upon GABA-ergic mechanisms are involved in that dangerous sequence of biological activities: environmental stress ? anxiety ? atherosclerosis and hypertension, the latter of which represent major health problems of man. Herein, some evidence that appears to support this view will be presented."
