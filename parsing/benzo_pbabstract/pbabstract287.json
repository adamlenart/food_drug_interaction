The search included no restrictions on languages. Keywords included priapism combined with antipsychotic agents and the names of the currently available atypical antipsychotics. Twenty-nine publications were located using these parameters. Additional publications were reviewed for general background on pathophysiology, evaluation, and management.

Detumescence is sympathetically mediated, and alpha1-adrenergic antagonism (within the corpora cavernosa) inhibits detumescence. The propensity of individual antipsychotics to induce priapism can presumably be estimated on the basis of alpha1adrenergic blockade affinities. Of the conventional antipsychotics, chlorpromazine and thioridazine have the greatest alpha1-adrenergic affinity and have been most frequently reported to be associated with priapism. Of the atypical antipsychotics, risperidone has greater alpha1-adrenergic affinity, although 3 of the 5 currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved atypicals have been reported to be associated with priapism.",

In most patients with SE, the use of adequate dosages of first-line antiepileptic agents allows for the successful and rapid termination of SE and avoidance of potential neurologic complications. Refractory SE requires more aggressive treatment, often the use of intravenous anesthetic agents and intense monitoring, and therefore must be managed in a pediatric intensive care unit with a multidisciplinary approach.

    "13": "CIE rats were confirmed to have increased GABAA receptor binding of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist and ethanol antidote ligand Ro15-4513, due to increased expression of the alpha6 subunit polypeptide in the cerebellum, shown by photoaffinity labeling. Estimates of mRNA levels by use of RT-PCR did not reveal any significant increase in alpha6 or in several other receptor subunits in several brain regions, but a decrease in the ratio of the long and short splice variants (L/S) of the gamma2 subunit was detected in the hippocampus, especially the CA1 region.", 
    "14": "Changes in GABAA receptors were found in rats given CIE. Increased alpha6 subunit in the cerebellum was demonstrated by using both the binding to diazepam-insensitive sites for [3H]Ro15-4513 and increased levels of the 57-kDa alpha6 polypeptide after photoaffinity labeling with this ligand. This increase appeared after 30 doses of ethanol and decayed to normal 1 week after ethanol was discontinued. The transient change in cerebellar alpha6 subunit-containing receptors, also reportedly seen after chronic continuous ethanol, is thus unlikely to account for the persistently hyperexcitable, kindled, seizure-susceptible state seen in CIE. However, the significant decrease in gamma2 subunit L/S splice variant ratio in the hippocampus implies changes in GABAA receptor function, possibly involving protein phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Altered receptor trafficking and turnover associated with synaptic plasticity may contribute to the observed reduced inhibition in the hippocampus and other signs of alcohol dependence produced by CIE.", 
    "15": "LY392098 is a member of a novel class of biarylpropylsulfonamides that potentiates AMPA receptor-mediated responses both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the effects of LY392098 were evaluated in two \"behavioral despair\" models (the forced swim and tail suspension tests) commonly used to identify clinically useful antidepressants. LY392098 reduced immobility in the forced swim test in both rats and mice, with a minimum effective dose of 0.5 mg/kg (i.p.) in both species. LY392098 (0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect motor activity of rats, indicating that the ability of this compound to reduce immobility in the forced swim test is unrelated to a motor stimulant action. LY392098 also reduced immobility in the tail suspension test in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum effective dose of 5 mg/kg (i.p). A non-competitive AMPA antagonist (LY300168) blocked the activity of LY392098 in the forced swim test, but did not affect imipramine-induced reductions in immobility. Thus, AMPA receptor activation appears to be required for the antidepressant-like effect of LY392098, but not imipramine. These findings indicate that biarylpropylsulfonamides, exemplified by LY392098, may represent a novel class of antidepressants.", 
    "16": "LY395153 is a member of a newly described class of arylpropylsulfonamide AMPA receptor potentiators. Here, we characterize and compare [(3)H]LY395153 binding to native AMPA receptors from rat cerebral cortex and recombinant human GluR4(flip) receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. L-Glutamate and AMPA increased [(3)H]LY395153 binding to both native and recombinant AMPA receptors in a concentration dependent and stereoselective manner; this effect of AMPA receptor agonists reflects an apparent increase in ligand affinity. In the presence of L-glutamate (500 microM), [(3)H]LY395153 binding is saturable; the affinity of this radioligand is slightly, albeit statistically significantly higher at human GluR4(flip) (K(d)=55.6+/-5.3nM) than rat cortical receptors (K(d)=110+/-15.1nM). NBQX competitively inhibited L-glutamate-induced increases in [(3)H]LY395153 binding in both native and recombinant receptors, whilst LY303070 (the active isomer of GYKI53655) noncompetitively inhibited this effect in native, but not recombinant receptors. The prototypic AMPA receptor potentiator cyclothiazide competitively inhibited [(3)H]LY395153 binding with a potency (K(i) approximately 7 microM) comparable to EC(50) values reported in electrophysiological studies. In contrast, the structurally unrelated AMPA receptor potentiator CX 516 did not inhibit [(3)H]LY395153 binding at concentrations of up to 600 microM. Further, at concentrations reported to facilitate AMPA receptor desensitization, thiocyanate acts as a competitive inhibitor of [(3)H]LY395153 binding. [(3)H]LY395153 binding was unaffected by a variety of structurally (and mechanistically) diverse compounds tested at a concentration of 10 microM. These data indicate [(3)H]LY395153 is a useful probe for labeling a unique modulatory site on both native and recombinant AMPA receptors.", 
    "17": "Environmental stressors can substantially affect the adaptive response of rats to novelty in a sexually dimorphic manner. Gender-related differences are also observed in neurochemical and behavioural patterns of adult rats following prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ). In the present study the behavioural reactivity to novelty is investigated in open field (OF) and in acoustic startle reflex (ASR) tests, in non handled (NH), short-lasting handled (SLH) and long-lasting handled (LLH) adult male and female rats prenatally exposed to DZ. A single daily s.c. injection of DZ (1.5 mg/kg) over gestation days 14-20 decreases GABA/BDZ receptor function in both sexes, as shown by the decreased electrographic hippocampal response to DZ and the increased response to picrotoxin, after intra-locus coeruleus injection of the two compounds. In OF NH DZ-exposed males display a lower total distance travelled (TDT), a higher rearing frequency (RF) and a greater number of transitions in the centre of the arena (CNT) compared to NH rats prenatally exposed to vehicle. Conversely, NH DZ-exposed females show slight changes in TDT and RF and a greater reduction in CNT and in the amount of time spent in the centre of the arena (CAT). These effects are associated with an increase in the peak amplitude of the ASR in both sexes. Short-lasting handling slightly influences DZ-evoked effects in animals of both sexes. In DZ-exposed males long-lasting handling attenuates the reduction in TDT and the enhancement in RF, prevents the increase in CNT and reduces the peak amplitude of ASR. In DZ-exposed females, long-lasting handling increases TDT and RF, induces a lower avoidance of the centre of the arena, and does not modify the peak amplitude of ASR, when compared to controls. These findings indicate that prenatal exposure to DZ differently affects behavioural reactivity in adult male and female rats, and suggest that a long-lasting handling is able to attenuate some behavioural deficits induced by prenatal DZ exposure.",

    "33": "With the ever-increasing workload from a variety of in vitro and in vivo screening procedures, new analytical methodologies to perform bioanalysis in an accurate and high-throughput manner are in great demand. In this work, monolithic columns were used instead of conventional particulate HPLC columns to perform chromatographic separations. Because the pressure drop on a monolithic column was considerably lower than that on a particulate column, a high flow rate (6 mL/min) was used for a 4.6 x 50 mm monolithic column with a total backpressure of about 61 bar measured using acetonitrile/water (50:50). The capability of using a regular column length at high flow rates, combined with the extremely small dependency of separation efficiency on linear flow velocity, allowed for the generation of sufficient chromatographic resolving power in a significantly reduced runtime. As demonstrated in this work, a plasma extract of a mixture of tempazepam, tamoxifen, fenfluramine, and alprozolam were baseline separated within a total analysis time of one minute. An average peak width at half maximum of approximately one second was noted using a generic broad gradient. It was also found that the separation efficiency and signal/noise (S/N) ratios for this separation remained almost constant at flow rates of 1, 3, and 6 mL/min, respectively. The ruggedness of the separation was evaluated by injecting 600 plasma extracts containing the replicates of a standard curve of the above mixture during an overnight run. The chromatographic retention time, separation quality, peak response and sensitivity were highly reproducible throughout the run. This high-speed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) system has been used routinely in the authors' laboratory to support drug discovery programs.", 
    "34": "We developed an in situ model to investigate the hypothesis that AMPA/kainate (AMPA/KA) receptor activation contributes to hypoxic-ischemic white matter injury in the adult brain. Acute coronal brain slices, including corpus callosum, were prepared from adult mice. After exposure to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), white matter injury was assessed by electrophysiology and immunofluorescence for oligodendrocytes and axonal neurofilaments. White matter cellular components and the stimulus-evoked compound action potential (CAP) remained stable for 12 hr after preparation. OGD for 30 min resulted in an irreversible loss of the CAP as well as structural disruption of axons and subsequent loss of neurofilament immunofluorescence. OGD also caused widespread oligodendrocyte death, demonstrated by the loss of APC labeling and the gain of pyknotic nuclear morphology and propidium iodide labeling. Blockade of AMPA/KA receptors with 30 microm NBQX or the AMPA-selective antagonist 30 microm GYKI 52466 prevented OGD-induced oligodendrocyte death. Oligodendrocytes also were preserved by the removal of Ca(2+), but not by a blockade of voltage-gated Na(+) channels. The protective action of NBQX was still present in isolated corpus callosum slices. CAP areas and axonal structure were preserved by Ca(2+) removal and partially protected by a blockade of voltage-gated Na(+) channels. NBQX prevented OGD-induced CAP loss and preserved axonal structure. These observations highlight convergent pathways leading to hypoxic-ischemic damage of cerebral white matter. In accordance with previous suggestions, the activation of voltage-gated Na(+) channels contributes to axonal damage. Overactivation of glial AMPA/KA receptors leads to oligodendrocyte death and also plays an important role in structural and functional disruption of axons.", 
    "35": "CCK-A receptors and neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) are involved in the regulation of food intake, and in rats, there is evidence for involvement of an intestinal vagal afferent pathway. Studies investigating the role of CCK-A receptors in activation of NTS neurons using highly selective CCK-A receptor agonists and antagonists have yielded conflicting data. In the present study, we investigated CCK-induced and postprandial activation of NTS neurons, together with food intake studies, in CCK-A receptor-deficient Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats. Activated NTS neurons were detected using immunohistological staining for c-Fos protein. Exogenous CCK increased the number of c-Fos protein-positive cells in the NTS of Sprague-Dawley and CCK-A receptor-intact Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats but had no effect in CCK-A receptor-deficient OLETF rats. Food intake-induced c-Fos protein expression in NTS neurons was significantly reduced in CCK-A receptor-deficient OLETF rats compared with Sprague-Dawley or LETO rats. Postprandial c-Fos protein expression in the NTS was also significantly decreased after pretreatment with the CCK-A receptor antagonist MK329 after both short- and long-term fasting periods. Exogenous CCK decreased cumulative food intake in Sprague-Dawley and LETO rats but not in OLETF rats. These data demonstrate that CCK-A receptors are involved in the CCK- and food-induced c-Fos protein expression in the NTS. Taken together with the results of the food intake studies, this suggests that activation of CCK-A receptors is involved in the postprandial activation of NTS neurons and in the regulation of food intake.", 
    "36": "There is evidence that GABA plays a major role in sleep regulation. GABA(A) receptor agonists and different compounds interacting with the GABA(A) receptor complex, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, can interfere with the sleep/wake cycle. On the other hand, there is very little information about the possible role of GABA(B) receptors in sleep modulation. The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), a cholinergic area in the basal forebrain, plays a pivotal role in the modulation of sleep and wakefulness, and both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors have been described within the NBM. This study used unilateral infusions in the NBM to determine the effects of 3-hydroxy-5-aminomethylisoxazole hydrobromide (muscimol hydrobromide, a GABA(A) receptor subtype agonist) and beta-(aminomethyl)-4-chlorobenzenepropanoic acid (baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor subtype agonist) on sleep parameters in freely moving rats by means of polygraphic recordings. Muscimol (0.5 nmol) and baclofen (0.7 nmol) induced an increase in slow-wave sleep and an inhibition of wakefulness. Muscimol, but not baclofen, also caused a decrease in desynchronized sleep parameters. The results reported here indicate that 1) the NBM activation of both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors influences the sleep/wake cycle, and 2) GABA(A) but not GABA(B) receptors are important for desynchronized sleep modulation, suggesting that the two GABAergic receptors play different roles in sleep modulation.", 
    "37": "Previous pharmacological studies have reported that striatal dopamine efflux is negatively modulated not only by presynaptic D2 dopamine autoreceptors but also by striatal D1 dopamine receptors. The present experiments employed in vivo microdialysis to further examine the ability of widely used benzazepine-class D1 agonists to modulate striatal dopamine efflux. In the present study, both the partial D1 agonist (+/-)-SKF 38393 (10 microM) and the full D1 agonist (+/-)-SKF 82958 (10 and 100 microM) significantly reduced striatal dopamine efflux during intrastriatal application. Intrastriatal application of the less active enantiomer, S(-)-SKF 38393 (10 microM) did not decrease striatal dopamine suggesting a selective receptor-mediated mode of action of (+/-)-SKF 38393. Additional experiments were conducted with the full D1 agonist (+/-)-SKF 82958 in order to characterize the receptor(s) mediating the observed decrease in dopamine efflux. Neither local application of the D1 antagonist R(+)-SCH 23390 (100 microM) nor local application of the selective D2 antagonist raclopride (5 microM) blocked the ability of (+/-)-SKF 82958 (10 microM) to decrease striatal dopamine efflux. However, intrastriatal application of the less selective D2 antagonist haloperidol (1 microM) did prevent the decrease in striatal dopamine efflux observed during intrastriatal (+/-)-SKF 82958 application. The present data suggest that the ability of intrastriatally applied benzazepine-class D1 agonists to decrease striatal dopamine efflux is receptor-mediated, but this action apparently is not mediated at D1 or D2 receptors. There is therefore no indication for an intrastriatal population of D1 receptors capable of modulating dopamine efflux.", 
    "38": "It has been proposed that new atypical antipsychotics cause minimal prolactin (PRL) elevation compared to traditional antipsychotic agents because they spare dopamine blockade within the brain's tuberoinfundibular tract. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of olanzapine and haloperidol on PRL secretion in male schizophrenic patients. Twenty-nine male schizophrenic inpatients were included in the study. Fifteen of them were given olanzapine in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day PO and 14 of them were given haloperidol in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day PO for 6 weeks after a 2-week drug washout period. Fifteen age-matched healthy control subjects were used as control group. PRL levels were measured both before and after the 6-week treatment period in the patients. At the end of the 6th week, the PRL values observed with olanzapine treatment were significantly less than those observed with haloperidol, but not different from those of the controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the PRL values and the severity of extrapyramidal side effects in only the haloperidol group after the six week's treatment period. Our data indicate that short-term olanzapine treatment at doses of 10 mg/day PO causes minimal elevations in PRL secretion in male schizophrenic patients in contrast to haloperidol. This finding is consistent with the previous reports and may be attributed to olanzapine's differential effects on dopamine neurotransmission.",

Three recombinant baculovirus constructs, each harboring a different GABA(A) receptor subunit, were introduced into insect cells by simultaneous infection. Saturation and competition binding assays were carried out in membranes from Sf-9 cells infected with either alpha1beta2gamma2 or alpha6beta2gamma2 subunit combinations. The affinities of the ligands to the alpha1beta2gamma2 or alpha6beta2gamma2 receptors expressed in Sf-9 cells were similar to the affinities previously determined for the alpha1 or alpha6 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors in the rat cerebellum, respectively, thus confirming the previously assigned receptor types in the cerebellum.",

The PBR agonist Ro5-4864 (10 nmol/l to 10 micromol/l) did not affect migration but slightly enhanced phagocytosis, while clonazepam, which binds to the central-type benzodiazepine receptors but has no affinity for PBRs, was ineffective on both parameters up to 10 micromol/l. Phagocytosis induced by diazepam or Ro5-4864 was inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blocker L-verapamil (10 micromol/l), which however did not affect the action of diazepam on migration. Competition binding experiments performed by fluorescent staining of PBRs showed that diazepam directly interacts with PBRs on human neutrophils. Both diazepam and Ro5-4864 (10 nmol/l to 10 micromol/l) induced a rise of intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), which was inhibited by PK11195 (10 micromol/l) and L-verapamil (10 micromol/l) and prevented by extracellular Ca2+ chelation with EGTA (5 mmol/l). In conclusion, experimental evidence indicates that in human neutrophils diazepam stimulates both migration and phagocytosis through activation of PBRs. Diazepam-induced [Ca2+]i changes depend on a PBR-operated, L-verapamil-sensitive increase in the plasma membrane permeability and subsequent extracellular Ca2+ entry, and contribute to diazepam-induced phagocytosis. On the contrary, the effect of diazepam on migration seems to occur through Ca2+ -independent mechanisms.", 
    "50": "Honokiol and magnolol have been identified as modulators of the GABAA receptors in vitro. Our previous study suggested a possible selectivity of honokiol and magnolol on GABAA receptor subtypes. This possibility was examined in the current study by 3H-muscimol and 3H-flunitrazepam binding assays on various rat brain membrane preparations and human recombinant GABA(A) receptor subunit combinations expressed by the Sf-9/baculovirus system. Generally, honokiol and magnolol have a similar enhancing effect on (3)H-muscimol binding to various membrane preparations in nonsaturation binding assays. Honokiol and magnolol preferentially increased (3)H-muscimol binding to hippocampus compared to cortex and cerebellum (with a maximum enhancement of 400% of control). As for subunit combinations, honokiol and magnolol have a more potent enhancing effect on alpha2 subunit containing combinations (with a maximum enhancement of 400-450% of control). This action was independent of the gamma subunit. In saturation binding assays, magnolol affected either the number of binding sites (ca. 4-fold on alpha2 containing combinations) or the binding affinity (on alpha1 containing combinations) of (3)H-muscimol binding to various GABAA receptor subunit combinations. In contrast, honokiol increased only binding sites on alpha2beta3gamma2s and alpha2beta3 combinations, but both the number of binding sites and the binding affinity on alpha1beta2gamma2S and alpha(1)beta2 combinations. These results indicate that honokiol and magnolol have some selectivity on different GABAA receptor subtypes. The property of interacting with GABAA receptors and their selectivity could be responsible for the reported in vivo effects of these two compounds.", 
    "51": "JL13 [5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-8-chloro-pyrido[2,3-b][1,5] benzoxazepine fumarate] is a substance with a close structural resemblance to clozapine. However, it is less sensitive to oxidation and may therefore have less hematological side effects. In the present study, JL13 was compared with clozapine and haloperidol in several animal models for schizophrenia. The paw test represents a screening model for antipsychotic drugs that can discriminate between drugs with extrapyramidal side effects and drugs without. Haloperidol increased both forelimb retraction time and hindlimb retraction time (HRT), whereas both clozapine and JL13 increased only HRT. In the prepulse inhibition paradigm, all three drugs reversed the apomorphine- and the amphetamine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition. However, whereas haloperidol was equally effective against both dopaminergic drugs, JL13 and clozapine were more effective against amphetamine. Finally, only JL13 was able to increase prepulse inhibition in normal rats, whereas only clozapine reduced basal startle amplitude. Taken together, these data suggest that JL13 may be an effective antipsychotic drug, with a profile similar to clozapine.", 
    "52": "Positive modulators of glutamate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors can enhance cognitive function in several species. The present experiments compared the actions of a novel biarylpropylsulfonamide compound, LY404187, with the prototypical benzoylpiperidine, 1-(quinoxalin-6-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine (CX516), on AMPA receptors of prefrontal cortex (PFC) pyramidal neurons. LY404187 (0.03-10 microM) selectively enhanced glutamate-evoked currents through AMPA receptor/channels of acutely isolated pyramidal neurons with considerably greater potency (EC50 = 1.3 +/- 0.3 microM) and efficacy (Emax = 45.3 +/- 8.0-fold increase) than did CX516 (EC50 = 2.8 +/- 0.9 mM; Emax = 4.8 +/- 1.4-fold increase). Both LY404187 and CX516 increased the potency of the glutamate concentration-response profile by 6- and 3-fold, respectively. Rapid perfusion experiments demonstrated that LY404187 produced a marked suppression in the magnitude but no change in the kinetics of receptor desensitization; whereas CX516 produced little change in the degree and a modest deceleration of the desensitization process. In PFC slices, both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials were enhanced by nanomolar concentrations of LY404187. Voltage-sensitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic responses also were indirectly augmented as a consequence of greater postsynaptic depolarization. Consistent with the in vitro data, LY404187 was 1000-fold more potent than CX516 in enhancing the probability of discharge of PFC neurons in response to stimulation of glutamatergic afferents from hippocampus in vivo. This potentiation by LY404187 was reduced by both selective AMPA (LY300168, 1 mg/kg, i.v.) and NMDA (LY235959, 5 mg/kg, i.v.) receptor antagonists. Collectively, these results demonstrate that LY404187 is an extremely potent and centrally active potentiator of native AMPA receptors and has a unique mechanism of action. The therapeutic implications of AMPA receptor potentiators are discussed.",

Fast gradients of methanol in ethoxynonafluorobutane on a cyano column have been successfully applied to the separation of steroids, benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and mixtures of purines and pyrimidines. Small amounts of triethylamine and trifluoroacetic acid added to such gradients significantly improved peak shape and column performance for basic and acidic solutes. Ethoxynonafluorobutane and its mixtures with methanol have also been demonstrated to have a unique selectivity in chiral HPLC applications.",

In addition to pain, all patients exhibited some symptoms of cognitive compromise and agitation. After initiation of the K/F/M infusion, all patients exhibited some degree of qualitative improvement in these symptoms as well as in overall pain control.

    "62": "Although intermaxillary fixation (IMF) is performed to treat the patients with maxillary fracture, this procedure is very stressful to the patients. IMF has been reported to increase noradrenaline (NA) release in the brain and elevate plasma corticosterone contents in the rat. These changes were significantly attenuated by diazepam, an anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine family. These results suggest that IMF could greatly affect the pituitary-adrenal system as a stress. In the present study, in order to examine the influence of IMF on the human body function, we measured levels of 17-hydrocorticosteroids (17-OHCS) and 17-ketosteroid (17-KS), which are metabolites of the adreno-cortical hormone cortisol, in the urine of inpatients undergoing IMF. The subjects were requested to fill out a questionnaire on irritableness caused by IMF. In these patients, urinary 17-OHCS levels were significantly increased after IMF and well correlated to the results of the questionnaire. The finding suggested that urinary 17-OHCS levels reflect stress related to IMF, and that such stress mainly causes an irritated feeling. Natural killer cell activity (NK activity), which is considered to be related to stress, was measured in these patients. The relationship between 17-OHCS levels and NK activity was examined in reference to the results of the questionnaire. Questionnaire showed that most patients noted insomnia and an irritated feeling during IMF. To examine the influence of anxiolytic agents on stress related to IMF, an anxiolytic agent, ethyl loflazepate, was administered during IMF, and urinary 17-OHCS levels were measured. There was no correlation between 17-OHCS levels and NK activity in the patients. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between visual analogue scale (VSA) and NK activity. Increases in 17-OHCS levels in the group treated with ethyl loflazepate, an anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine family, were significantly lower than in the untreated group. This suggests that ethyl loflazepate reduced stress responses to IMF. It has been reported that NK activity is reduced inpatients with depression or chronic fatigue syndrome. However, NK activity may not be affected by mechanical stress such as IMF. The finding that an anxiolytic agent, ethyl loflazepate, inhibited stress responses to IMF further suggests that anxiolytic drugs are very useful for treatment of irritated feeling of the patients undergoing IMF.",

    "85": "A variety of photic and nonphotic stimuli can phase-shift the mammalian circadian pacemaker. It has been suggested that the phase-response curves (PRCs) characterizing these diverse stimuli may comprise two major PRC families, one typified by the photic PRC describing the response to brief light pulses, and the other typified by the nonphotic PRC describing the response to stimuli evoking behavioral arousal and/or locomotor activity. Additionally, the mammalian circadian pacemaker can be phase-shifted by dark pulses presented on a constant-light (LL) background. While dark pulse-induced phase shifting was interpreted originally as a mirror-image photic effect, other observations suggest that the dark pulse PRC may instead belong to the family of nonphotic, activity-dependent PRCs. In a recent study, we reexamined the phase-shifting effects of dark pulses in the Syrian hamster, and concluded that the dark pulse PRC reflects both nonphotic and photic mirror-image mechanisms. In the current report, we reanalyze previously published hamster PRC data using polynomial curve-fitting procedures. The results of these analyses reveal that (a) the photic and nonphotic PRCs have identical shape but opposite phasing, and (b) the dark pulse PRC can be modeled by simple summation of nonphotic and photic mirror-image PRCs. This model predicts accurately the shape of the dark pulse PRC, particularly the extension of the phase-advance region into the subjective night.",

The two distinct treatment regimes produced significantly different changes in GABA(A) receptor alpha4-, beta2-, beta3- and gamma1-subunit mRNA steady-state levels. Similar changes in the GABA enhancement of flunitrazepam binding and the BZ3/BZ2 subtype ratio determined ex vivo were produced, however, significant differences were found in [(3)H]-Ro 15-4513 binding between cortical tissue from diazepam injected animals compared with diazepam infused animals.

    "91": "The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory agents used to treat acid-related disorders. As such, they are frequently prescribed for patients who are concurrently using other medications. PPIs may interact with other drugs through numerous mechanisms. The most important include competitive inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and alteration of the absorption of other drugs via changes in gastric pH levels. Poor metabolizers, who lack CYP2C19, may be particularly predisposed to drug interactions. Although the potential for drug interactions is high, few clinically significant interactions have been reported for the PPIs. Nevertheless, caution is indicated when certain drugs are co-prescribed with these agents. The incidence of clinically significant drug interactions increases proportionately with the number of drugs taken and with the age of the patient. The drug interaction with the greatest clinical importance is the reduction in benzodiazepine clearance by omeprazole.", 
    "92": "The present investigation examined sensitivity to the effects of various sedative-hypnotics on motor performance in rats treated chronically with phenobarbital. Eight rats were trained to walk on a rotorod treadmill at low (8 r.p.m.) and high (24 r.p.m.) rotational speeds. Prior to the chronic regimen, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, amobarbital, diazepam and clonazepam produced dose-dependent impairments in motor performance at both speeds. During chronic treatment with phenobarbital (100 mg/kg/day), tolerance was conferred to the effects of all the drugs examined, as evidenced by rightward shifts in their dose-effect curves. For all drugs, the magnitude of this tolerance was generally consistent across the two speeds. Following a 6-week washout period, during which no drugs were administered, dose-effect curves for each drug shifted back toward their original (i.e. pre-chronic) positions. Under all conditions, the doses required for each drug to impair motor performance at the low speed were higher than those required to impair motor performance at the high speed. These data suggest that sensitivity to the motor-impairing effects of sedative-hypnotics is influenced by the difficulty of the behavioral task, but that task difficulty does not modulate the maximal extent to which tolerance and cross-tolerance are expressed.",

    "94": "Forty patients undergoing third molar extractions under intravenous conscious sedation were randomly assigned to 2 groups. In both groups, induction of sedation was performed using a standard dose of fentanyl (1.5 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.05 mg/kg). Propofol was then given in 10 to 20 mg boluses until a clinically desirable sedation level was achieved. In 1 group, the BIS was then monitored continually during surgery using a microcomputer (Aspect-1050 Monitor, Aspect Co, Natick, MA) and recorded at 5-minute intervals. The anesthetist (N.A.S.) provided additional propofol boluses to maintain a BIS level of 70 to 80. In the other group, the BIS sensor was applied, but the monitor was not used. In this group, the sedation was modified, and additional propofol was given based solely on the anesthetist's subjective assessment of the desired level of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [OAA/S] scale level 2 to 3). Additional boluses of 1 mg of midazolam were given during the procedure if patients required repeated boluses of propofol at less than 5-minute intervals to maintain the desired sedation level (BIS level of 70 to 80 or OAA/S level of 2 to 3). These additional midazolam boluses, as well as the time of the last sedative dose (propofol or midazolam) were recorded to study the effect of these factors on recovery.",

For the remaining 39 subjects, 19 were assessed objectively using the BIS monitor, whereas 20 were assessed subjectively using the OAA/S scale. The BIS cases were slightly longer in duration than the OAA/S cases, lasting an average of 26 minutes versus 22 minutes. This difference was statistically nonsignificant (P =.19). Less propofol was used in the BIS cases, with an average of 98 mg for BIS cases versus 106 mg for OAA/S cases (P =.59). The total dose in mg/kg/min was significantly less in the BIS group (0.054 mg/kg/min) than in the OAA/S group (0.074 mg/kg/min; P =.0082). There was no significant difference in the amount of midazolam administered after induction between the 2 groups (P =.60). The surgeon, who was blinded to whether the monitor was used, ranked the third molar extractions more difficult in the BIS group (P =.05). However, patients in the BIS group were on average more cooperative, with better maintenance of muscle tone. The difference in these parameters were nonsignificant (P =.15 and .092, respectively). A positive Romberg test was obtained earlier in BIS patients, although this difference was nonsignificant (P =.097). The straight-line test was completed significantly sooner in BIS patients (P =.013). There was no significant difference between the BIS and OAA/S groups in perceptual speed (P =.55) or computation (P =.32).

    "97": "Brain functions are based on the dynamic interaction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Spillover of glutamate from excitatory synapses may diffuse to and modulate nearby inhibitory synapses. By recording unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) from cell pairs in CA1 of the hippocampus, we demonstrated that low concentrations of Kainate receptor (KAR) agonists increased the success rate (P(s)) of uIPSCs, whereas high concentrations of KAR agonists depressed GABAergic synapses. Ambient glutamate released by basal activities or stimulation of the stratum radiatum increases the efficacy of GABAergic synapses by activating presynaptic KARs, which facilitate Ca(2+)-dependent GABA release. The results suggest that glutamate released from excitatory synapses may also function as an intermediary between excitatory and inhibitory synapses to protect overexcitation of local circuits.", 
    "98": "In the present study, we have investigated the effects of centrally administered ginsenoside Rc and Rg1 on the modulation of the NMDA receptor and GABA(A)receptor binding in rat brain. The NMDA receptor binding was analysed by quantitative autoradiography using [(3)H]MK-801 binding, and the GABA(A)receptor bindings were analysed by using [(3)H]muscimol and [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in rat brain slices. Rats were infused with ginsenoside Rc or Rg1 (10 microg/10 microl h(-1), i.c.v.) for 7 days, through pre-implanted cannula using osmotic minipumps (Alzet, model 2ML). The levels of [(3)H]MK-801 binding were highly decreased in part of the parietal layers of the cortex and cingulated by ginsenoside Rc and Rg1. The levels of [(3)H]muscimol binding were strongly elevated in almost all regions of the frontal cortex by the treatment of ginsenoside Rc but decreased by ginsenoside Rg1. However, the [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding was not modulated by ginsenoside Rc or Rg1 infusion. These results suggest that prolonged infusion of ginsenosides could differentially modulate [(3)H]MK-801 and [(3)H]muscimol binding in a region-specific manner.", 
    "99": "The 1,4- and the 1,5-benzodiazepines (BDZ) are commonly used as anxiolytic and anticonvulsive drugs. It has been suggested that they influence, particularly through stimulation of peripheral BDZ receptors, some immune cell properties such as pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The availability of a new class of [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepine derivatives (compounds IV), endowed with anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic properties but no anti-pentylenetetrazole activity, prompted us to investigate in more detail the anti-inflammatory properties of three selected compounds IV (N,N-dimethyl-1-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benz- odiazepin-5-amine; N,N-dibutyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5-amine; 1-methyl-N,N-dimethyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5-amine) and one structurally related compound (1-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5(6H)-one). These BDZ derivatives have lost their affinity for the central and peripheral BDZ receptors. The in vivo effect on leukocyte migration of these compounds was investigated by using the mouse air-pouch model of local inflammation. Compounds A and B, significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced leukocyte recruitment in a dose-dependent manner starting from the dose of 50 mgkg(-1), whereas compound C was effective only at the higher dose of 100 mgkg(-1). Compound D did not exert such effects at any of the doses considered. The effect of compounds A, B and C on leukocyte recruitment was paralleled by a significant inhibition of interleukin-6 and prostaglandin E(2)production in the exudate, similarly to indomethacin, and by a partial reduction of vascular permeability. These features may be relevant for the design and development of innovative anti-inflammatory molecules among the 4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepin-5-amine derivatives.", 
    "100": "Recombinant mouse 18 kDa peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and isolated using a His. Bind metal chelation resin. Recombinant PBR protein was purified with sodium dodecyl sulfate and reincorporated into liposomes using Bio-Beads SM2 as a detergent removing agent. Negative staining of the reconstituted PBR samples, examined by electron microscopy, showed the formation of proteoliposomes. Freeze-fracture of these proteoliposomes revealed the presence of transmembranous particles of an average size of 3.5 +/- 0.25 nm, consistent with the presence of a monomeric form of the recombinant PBR protein. The reconstituted protein exhibited the ability to bind both the PBR drug ligand isoquinoline carboxamide PK 11195 and cholesterol with nanomolar affinities. These data suggest that a PBR monomer is the minimal functional unit, binding drug ligands and cholesterol.",

Twenty minutes later, anesthesia was induced by propofol infusion at 30 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1). ED50, ED95 and group medians for times and doses were determined and compared at multiple anesthetic endpoints.", 
    "103": "At the hypnotic, motor and EEG endpoints, midazolam premedication significantly and similarly reduced propofol ED50 (reduction: 18%, 13% and 20% respectively; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients) and ED95 (reduction: 20%, 11% and 20% respectively; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients). For antinociception (LRP), dose reduction by premedication was greater for propofol ED95 (reduction: 41%; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients) than ED50 (reduction: 18%; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients). Hemodynamic values were similar in both groups at the various endpoints.",

    "105": "The interaction of selected compounds with the binding of the benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam to membranes isolated from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, stably transfected with the aI( 2 2S subtype of GABAA receptors, was studied. This subtype of GABAA receptors is the most common type of GABAA receptor found in the brain, and benzodiazepines are drugs known to enhance the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) by binding to the benzodiazepine binding sites which are part of the GABAA receptor complex. Scatchard analysis of binding data revealed the existence of a single type of binding site for [3H]flunitrazepam. GABA and thiopental enhanced, while the antagonist of central benzodiazepine binding sites--flumazenil, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, flunitrazepam and diazepam, and the triazolopyridazine CI 218,872--displaced with nanomolar potency the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam. A partial displacement was obtained with the antagonist of the peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites--PK 11195--and with the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The potency of drugs to enhance or inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding mainly corresponded to that observed for the modulation of the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the native type 1 benzodiazepine binding sites. This, as well as a high density of expressed binding sites, makes the cell line under study a very reliable and economical model for the testing of effects of different compounds at the GABAA receptor.", 
    "106": "Dental treatment in children too young or too apprehensive to co-operate is often performed under sedation. The aim of this study was to survey the use of rectal and oral liquid and tablet benzodiazepine sedation in Swedish child dentistry, and estimation of treatment success. A questionnaire was sent to 500 randomly selected dentists (GPs) working in the Public Dental Health Service and all (77) specialists (PDs) working at paediatric dentistry clinics. Benzodiazepine sedation was used by 73% of the GPs and 97% of the PDs. Seven per cent of the GPs and 87% of the PDs had sedation sessions at least once a month. Of the GPs, 60% administered the sedation rectally, 7% orally in liquid form, and 39% orally in tablet form. For PDs, the corresponding figures were 97%, 78%, and 68%. Sixteen per cent of the GPs and 84% of the PDs used midazolam for rectal sedation. PDs rated rectal sedation better than the GPs (p < 0.001). GPs rated their experiences of rectal sedation as better the more frequent the use (p = 0.03), as did PDs concerning oral liquid sedation (p = 0.03). Thus, it seems that a more regular use of sedation is advantageous in achieving better treatment outcome.",

There was a right ear dysacusia and a perilimbal vitiligo associated with an area of iris depigmentation in the right eye. Pleocytosis and hypergammaglobulin were detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Because medical treatment that included phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, gamma-globulin, and a ketogenic diet was ineffective, he underwent a right hemispherectomy. Neuropathologic examination showed a widespread scattered inflammatory process with numerous microglial nodules and perivascular lymphocytic cuffing associated with degenerative changes with severe neuronal loss, loosening of the neuropil, and microcystic changes with tissue collapse. The coexistence of vitiligo and possibly Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in this child reinforces the autoimmune theory as the pathogenesis of Rasmussen syndrome.", 
    "110": "In mammalian CNS, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) is localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane within the astrocytes and microglia. The main function of PTBR is to transport cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane to the site of neurosteroid biosynthesis. The present study evaluated the changes in the PTBR density, gene expression and immunoreactivity in gerbil hippocampus as a function of reperfusion time after transient forebrain ischemia. Between 3 to 7 days of reperfusion, there was a significant increase in the maximal binding site density (B(max)) of the PTBR antagonist [(3)H]PK11195 (by 94-156%; P < 0.01) and PTBR mRNA levels (by 1.8- to 2.9-fold; P < 0.01). At 7 days of reperfusion, in the hippocampal CA1 (the brain region manifesting selective neuronal death), PTBR immunoreactivity increased significantly. Increased PTBR expression after transient forebrain ischemia may lead to increased neurosteroid biosynthesis, and thus may play a role in the ischemic pathophysiology.",

    "112": "Anxiety disorders frequently occur in individuals with neurologic illness. Anxiety may be a symptom of or a reaction to the neurologic disorder, a medication side effect, or a comorbid condition. The most common anxiety disorders seen in neurologic patients are panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Very often, these conditions go unrecognized (and therefore untreated) or are attributed to being a normal response to having a neurologic illness. However, if they are not treated, anxiety disorders can significantly increase morbidity and mortality in neurologic patients. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) should be considered the first-line of pharmacologic treatment, because they offer a broad spectrum of efficacy in the anxiety disorders, are generally well tolerated, and are effective in treating comorbid depression. Benzodiazepines, although most effective for acute anxiety, are now considered adjunctive or second-line treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy and other behavioral treatments are effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. They should be considered primary treatments for patients who cannot tolerate or prefer not to take medications.", 
    "113": "Profound alterations in the function of GABA occur over the course of postnatal development. Changes in GABA(A) receptor expression are thought to contribute to these differences in GABAergic function, but how subunit changes correlate with receptor function in individual developing neurons has not been defined precisely. In the current study, we correlate expression of 14 different GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs with changes in the pharmacological properties of the receptor in individual hippocampal dentate granule cells over the course of postnatal development in rat. We demonstrate significant developmental differences in GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA expression, including greater than two-fold lower expression of alpha1-, alpha4- and gamma2-subunit mRNAs and 10-fold higher expression of alpha5-mRNA in immature compared with adult neurons. These differences correlate both with regional changes in subunit protein level and with alterations in GABA(A) receptor function in immature dentate granule cells, including two-fold higher blockade by zinc and three-fold lower augmentation by type-I benzodiazepine site modulators. Further, we find an inverse correlation between changes in GABA(A) receptor zinc sensitivity and abundance of vesicular zinc in dentate gyrus during postnatal development. These findings suggest that developmental differences in subunit expression contribute to alterations in GABA(A) receptor function during postnatal development.",

They were randomly assigned to one of two parallel groups of 12 subjects each (a placebo group and a lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg group). Visual acuity was measured for each eye separately (Snellen chart and Parinaud scale). Binocular vision was studied using the cover tests, measurement of the fusional amplitudes (with Berens prisms), and the Duane Scale Test (near point rule) measuring convergence and/or accommodation in centimeters or diopters as a function of age.",

    "118": "Sleep is an active process, not just a default state when there is less incoming sensory information. It can be understood best by considering fluctuating levels of a series of neurotransmitters including the biogenic amines and acetylcholine. The effects of these neurotransmitters are not unique to sleep, but also subserve a wide range of other functions, including affect, sexual behavior, and appetite. The mechanism by which the most common hypnotics work is by binding to the benzodiazepine recognition site of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which mediates action of the most widely distributed inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. It is possible that some endogenous sleep factors indirectly alter the properties of this receptor complex.", 
    "119": "Research on insomnia has provided a number of important new insights, but fundamental deficits in our understanding remain. In considering priorities for future research, 3 areas warrant immediate attention. First, a causal relationship between insomnia and the adverse outcomes seen in insomnia patients needs to be established. Second, currently available symptomatic therapies need to be optimized. Recent data suggest that some benzodiazepine receptor agonists produce their hypnotic effect without side effects that were presumed to be inherent to sedation. Understanding the neuropharmacology underlying this differential effect would allow substantial improvements in the risk-benefit ratio for these drugs. Finally, the mechanisms of insomnia need to be better understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that physiologic arousal is important to the clinical presentation of primary insomnia. It remains unclear, however, whether this activation is primary or secondary to the insomnia itself. If physiologic hyperarousal causes primary insomnia, it would provide new approaches to the management of this disorder.", 
    "120": "Insomnia is a cardinal symptom for many psychiatric disorders, especially depressive disorders. Treatment of the underlying psychiatric disorder may be sufficient to relieve the accompanying insomnia. If the insomnia fails to respond, then consideration should be given to the possibility of inadequate treatment of the primary psychiatric disorder, iatrogenic insomnia, insomnia related to a medical disorder, or learned/habit insomnia. Persistent insomnia should be aggressively pursued, since it has been associated with a variety of adverse outcomes in samples of depressed patients. The physician should always inquire about and encourage healthy sleeping behaviors, even if hypnotic medication is contemplated. Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) have the best evidence for efficacy as hypnotics, although sedating antidepressants are popularly prescribed. Although all benzodiazepine hypnotics and nonbenzodiazepine BzRAs are comparably efficacious in inducing sleep, they vary markedly in their potential for residual side effects.",

The average active dose was taken by 12% of the patients, 5% took the maximum dosage and 41% too low a dosage. Consequently, 6 out of the 10 patients used the correct medication (antidepressant) and less than 20% used a sufficiently high dosage. Of the patients, 38% had never previously taken antidepressants, 31% had previously used one antidepressant, 17% two different antidepressants and 12% at least three different antidepressants; 13% had taken the antidepressant at the highest dosage, 18% at the average active dosage and 31% at too low (thus ineffective) a dosage.

    "130": "A versatile, sensitive, and selective high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the determination of common benzodiazepines and some of their most frequently occurring metabolites in forensic samples was developed and optimized with respect to effective and rapid sample preparation and high selectivity of the analytical assay. The optimized method includes liquid-liquid extraction of the drugs with chloroform followed by isocratic reversed-phase chromatography on a LiChrospher-100 RP-8ec column (150 x 4.6-mm i.d.) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.03 mol/L acetate buffer (pH 4.6)/acetonitrile (55:45, v/v). The use of dual-mode detection made up of UV-detection (250 nm) in series with reductive electrochemical detection (-1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) at the hanging mercury drop electrode permits the detection and quantitation of benzodiazepines even in degraded samples with higher selectivities than usually reached with conventional HPLC techniques. Depending on the actual benzodiazepine species, detection limits are in the range of 2.0 to 14.1 ng/mL. Mean recovery values of the drugs from blood range from 82 to 92%; within-day and day-to-day repeatabilities typically lie between 3 and 9%.

A total of 108 treatment-outcome trials for social phobia met inclusion/exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Eleven treatment conditions were compared: wait-list control, pill placebo, benzodiazepines (BDZs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, attention placebo, exposure (EXP), cognitive restructuring (CR), EXP plus CR, social skills training, and applied relaxation. The most consistently effective treatments for social phobia were pharmacotherapies. BDZs and SSRIs were equally effective and more effective than control conditions. Dropout rates were similar among all the active treatment conditions. Assessment of the durability of treatment gains for pharmacotherapies was not possible because an insufficient number of drug studies included follow-up data. The treatment gains of psychological therapies, although moderate, continued during the follow-up period. BDZs and SSRIs seem to be effective treatments for social phobia, at least in the short term. Recommendations for future research include assessing the long-term outcome for pharmacotherapies and evaluating the inclusion of a cognitive-behavioral treatment during the drug tapering period.",

Nine healthy children (64-98 months old) received 0.25 or 0.375 mg of sublingual triazolam before dental treatment. Plasma triazolam concentrations were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and analyzed by noncompartmental methods. The peak concentration was 4.9 +/- 2.0 ng/mL (mean +/- SD), time to peak was 75 +/- 32 minutes, the elimination half-life was 91 +/- 32 minutes, and apparent clearance was 17.6 +/- 8.8 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1). Children were tested for gait ataxia, amnesia, and diplopia during a screening session and again after triazolam. Ninety minutes after drug administration, seven of nine children demonstrated ataxia, and three of nine demonstrated amnesia. Peak triazolam concentrations were similar in children with or without ataxia, but they were significantly higher in children with amnesia compared with those without amnesia. Six children demonstrated diplopia 30 and 120 minutes after triazolam; however, peak triazolam concentrations were similar in both groups. Sublingual administration was an acceptable alternative route of triazolam delivery in children.", 
    "134": "Although intravenous haloperidol (HAL) is an effective medication that is often prescribed to treat agitation, several instances of torsade de pointes or prolonged QT interval have been reported. To investigate the association between intravenous HAL and QT prolongation and between intravenous HAL and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, a cross-sectional cohort study was performed that included measuring corrected QT intervals (QTc) on an emergency basis before intravenous HAL and continuously monitoring electrocardiographic (ECG) findings after intravenous HAL. During a 2-month period, 47 patients received intravenous injections to control psychotic disruptive behavior. According to clinical practice, patients were divided as follows. The FZ-alone group was treated with intravenous flunitrazepam (FZ), and the FZ-plus-HAL group received intravenous FZ followed by intravenous HAL. Although the difference in the mean QTc immediately after intravenous FZ between the two groups was not significant, the mean QTc after 8 hours in the FZ-plus-HAL group was longer than that in the FZ-alone group (p < 0.001). Four patients in the FZ-plus-HAL group had a QTc of more than 500 msec after 8 hours. The change in QTc during 8 hours significantly differed between the two groups (t = 2.64, p > 0.05). Furthermore, the change in QTc was moderately correlated with the dose of intravenous HAL, as evidenced by a coefficient of correlation of 0.48 (p < 0.001). However, ventricular tachyarrhythmia was not detected among 307 patients within a 1-year period, although the ECG was continuously monitored for at least 8 hours after intravenous HAL. The modest nature of QTc prolongation and the apparent absence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia under continuous ECG monitoring indicate that QTc prolongation associated with intravenous HAL is not necessarily dangerous. However, in an emergency situation, clinicians cannot exclude patients predisposed to torsade de pointes, such as those with inherited ion channel disorders. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the association between intravenous HAL and QT prolongation.",

Patients were enrolled in Medicare as well as in the New Jersey Medicaid or Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled programs. Benzodiazepine use, as well as other covariates, were assessed before the index date (which was either the date of hospital admission for hip fracture surgical repair or, for the comparison subjects, a randomly assigned, frequency-matched date).", 
    "141": "All benzodiazepine doses > or =3 mg/day in diazepam equivalents significantly increased the adjusted risk of hip fracture by 50%. Significantly increased adjusted risks of hip fracture were seen during the initial 2 weeks of use (60% increase) and after more than 1 month of continuous use (80% increase) but not for 2-4 weeks of continuous use. Use of benzodiazepines other than long-acting agents significantly increased the risk of hip fracture by 50%.", 
    "142": "Even at modest doses, including some low doses currently advocated in prescribing guidelines for older patients, treatment with benzodiazepines appears to increase the risk of hip fracture. Patients appear to be particularly vulnerable immediately after initiating therapy and after more than 1 month of continuous use. Benzodiazepines with shorter half-lives appear to be no safer than longer half-life agents. Clinicians should be aware of these risks and weigh them against potential benefits when prescribing for elderly patients.",

Although aggressive pharmacological treatment of status epilepticus is well established in the emergency department and hospital settings, the relative risks and benefits of active therapy for status epilepticus in the prehospital setting are not known. The Prehospital Treatment of Status Epilepticus (PHTSE) study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to address the following aims: (1) to determine whether administration of benzodiazepines by paramedics is an effective and safe means of treating status epilepticus in the prehospital setting and whether this therapy influences longer-term patient outcome, (2) to determine whether lorazepam is superior to diazepam for the treatment of status epilepticus in the prehospital setting, and (3) to determine whether control of status epilepticus prior to arrival to the emergency department influences patient disposition. The initial phase of the PHTSE study began in January 1994 and was completed in February 1999 after the successful enrollment of 205 patients into the three treatment arms. In this paper, we describe the rationale for the conceptualization of the study and details of the study design and methodology, and emphasize some aspects of study implementation that are unique to research involving the emergency medical system.", 
    "144": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the regulation of pancreatic amylase has not been fully clarified. We examined the effects of hyperCCKemia with chronic pancreatico-biliary diversion (PBD) and blockade of CCK(A)-receptor on rat pancreatic amylase activity and mRNA abundance. Also, we examined the relationship between diet and CCK in terms of regulation of pancreatic amylase. PBD was produced by transposition of the duodenal segment containing the ampulla of Vater to the upper ileum. A potent CCK(A)-receptor antagonist, devazepide, was injected (6 mg/kg body weight per day for 5 days) in the PBD rats fed with diets containing normal or low level of carbohydrate (695 or 345 g sucrose/kg diet). The specific activity and mRNA abundance of the pancreatic amylase were constantly lower 4, 10 and 28 days after PBD than those after the sham operation. Devazepide treatment completely restored the amylase activity lowered by PBD without any increases in amylase mRNA. Feeding a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet suppressed the pancreatic amylase activity and mRNA abundance in PBD rats to a similar degree in those treated, and those untreated, with devazepide. We conclude that endogenous CCK suppresses pancreatic amylase production, and we speculate that CCK reduced translational efficiency of amylase mRNA. The effect of CCK on amylase production is independent of regulation by dietary carbohydrate.", 
    "145": "With flavone as a structural template, three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies and ab initio calculations were performed on a series of flavonoids. A reasonable pharmacophore model was built through CoMFA, CoMSIA, and HQSAR analyses and electrostatic potential calculations. A plausible binding mode for flavonoids with GABA(A) receptors was rationalized. On the basis of the commonly recognized binding site, the specific S1 and S2 subsites relating to substituent positions were proposed. The different binding affinities could be explained according to the frontier orbitals and electrostatic potential (ESP) maps. The ESP could be used as a novel starting point for designing more selective BZ-binding-site ligands.", 
    "146": "There is a relationship between depression and Myocardial Infarction (MI) as higher levels of depression and severe depression (major vs minor) are associated with higher morbidity and mortality due to cardiac events, which are mainly caused by arrhythmia. Second, severity of MI is not or even inversely related to development of depression. Depression post-MI goes often unrecognized as only 10% of depressed MI patients are diagnosed as such. This underestimation of depression is attributed to its atypical profile, tendency of physicians to interpret depressive symptoms as a transient and 'natural' reaction to a life-threatening event, and the scarce knowledge of risk factors associated with development of post-MI depression. During the first 18 months following MI major depression occurs in 15-30% of patients. Depression should be assessed in an early stage as depression has the highest prevalence in hospital and in the first 6 months post-MI. Risk factors for developing post-MI depression include complications during hospitalization, prescription of benzodiazepines during hospitalisation, previous history of depression, and not being able to stop smoking. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be first choice treatment in post-MI depression. As yet there is no information on the efficacy and safety of Serotonin and Noradrenalin Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs).", 
    "147": "The effects of single oral doses of zopiclone and temazepam were investigated in eight healthy male volunteers using a single blind, placebo controlled cross over study. Doses of zopiclone were 7.5 and 15 mg while the dose of temazepam was 20 mg. Each dose was separated by at least a one-week washout period. For each subject the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was determined on a screening night and the drugs were administered at the time of the DLMO. Melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay from plasma samples collected throughout the night. Both temazepam and zopiclone tended to reduce the amount of melatonin secreted, as determined by the area under the plasma concentration time curve. The differences from placebo were not statistically significant (F 3.31 = 1.07, P > 0.1). Similarly a repeated measures analysis of variance on the plasma concentration-time curves did not show any statistically significant differences between drugs and placebo (F 3.28 = 1.15, P > 0.1). There was no evidence from this study of a phase shifting effect of the drugs used. The reasons for the lack of effect on melatonin may be due to the differences in potency of the interaction of these drugs with the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ion channel.", 
    "148": "A 54-y-old man ingested 2 g of bulk laboratory diazepam and was treated with activated charcoal, enhanced diuresis and flumazenil infusion. The treatment resulted in awakening, but the patient had drowsiness, dysarthria, diplopia, and dizziness for 9 d. Blood levels of diazepam and its main metabolite, nordiazepam, were obtained for 1 mo. The half-lives in this benzodiazepine overdose were longer than those seen with therapeutic doses. Benzodiazepines should not be readministrated when patients awake after suicide attempts.", 
    "149": "An efficient solid phase regioselective alkylation at the N4 position of a 3-oxo-1,4-benzodiazepine template exemplified by 4-H-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7-iodo-3-oxo-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-acetate-polymer ester is described. Further chemical elaboration at position 7, utilizing a modified Heck reaction, allows the incorporation of amides from primary or secondary amines. The two diversity points at positions 4 and 7 were utilized to synthesize a 28-membered, combinatorial array on Sasrin resin in moderate yields and > 80% purity. Having validated the chemistry on solid support, a combine and split approach to prepare a bead-bound combinatorial library is achievable utilizing similar experimental practices and procedures as in the array synthesis.", 
    "150": "The \"immediate-onset\"-acting hypnotics (1-2 h after oral administration) (e.g., benzodiazepines) serve as the leading approach and great progress has been made in this century. They are exogenous from artificial synthesis and mainly fit for short-term insomnia. The \"gradual-onset\"-acting hypnotics (3-5 d after oral administration) are mild and gradually effective, but are very safe and without noticeable side or adverse effects. They are endogenous or endogenous-mimetic from natural isolation. It may serve as a more natural approach for the treatment of chronic or long-term insomnia, which is mainly gradually developed. This approach is especially useful in treating elderly people, whose numbers are rapidly increasing worldwide, especially in the next century. Sleep-Aid Tea (SAT) is a naturally processed Tea consisting of endogenous or endogenous-mimetic sleep-inducing substances isolated from specific natural and edible fruits and plants well known for the treatment of insomnia, e.g., Compendium of Materia Medica (Li, 1596) associated with modern knowledge and isolation technology (Liu, 1990, 1993). SAT is especially fit for the treatment of insomnia in aged people because it is mild, \"gradual-onset\"-acting (3-5 d after oral administration), natural, safe and without side effects.", 
    "151": "Seven cases of sexual behavior during sleep (SBS) have been recently reported. The subjects had histories of behavioral parasomnias as well as positive family histories of parasomnia. A 27 year-old man with a history of sexual behavior during sleep was reported. His sleep history disclosed sleepwalking (SW) since 9 years of age. He also developed episodes of highly disruptive and violent nocturnal behavior with dream enactment at age 20 years, which often resulted in physical injuries either to himself or his wife and infant. His wife also reported episodes of amnestic sexual behavior that began 4 years before referral. During the episodes, the patient typically procured his wife, achieving complete sexual intercourse with total amnesia. Physical and neurological diagnostic workups were unremarkable. Family history disclosed sleepwalking in his brother. He was put on 2mg/day of bedtime clonazepam with a remarkable clinical improvement. This case involves either the combination of violent and non-violent sleepwalking with SBS, or the superimposition of presumed REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) on top of preexisting SW in a man who also developed SBS in adulthood. Thus, this is a case report of probable parasomnia overlap syndrome.", 
    "152": "The effects of both REM sleep deprivation and its recovery on pontine and hippocampus muscarinic M2 receptors were investigated in synaptosomes using [3H]-AF-DX 384 as a ligand. Animals were divided into three groups: REM sleep deprivation group (small platforms 6.5 cm of diameter); stress group (large platforms 14 cm of diameter) and cage control group. In a second experiment REM sleep-deprived animals were allowed 48 h of recovery. REM sleep-deprived rats showed a reduction in M2 receptors compared with both intact and stress groups. Changes in M2 receptors were also observed after 48 h of recovery from REM sleep deprivation only in hippocampus. The enhancement of acetylcholine release during both REM sleep deprivation and recovery could explain the present findings.", 
    "153": "The sleep-promoting effect of the pineal hormone melatonin in humans is known for decades. However, the mechanisms of this phenomenon remain obscure, mainly due to lack of a simple, genetically tractable, animal model. We now report that melatonin promotes sleep-like state in a diurnal lower vertebrate, zebrafish (Danio rerio), and this effect is mediated through activation of specific melatonin membrane receptors. Furthermore, our data show that the sleep-like state in zebrafish has fundamental similarities with sleep in mammals, including characteristic postures, elevated arousal threshold to sensory stimulation and a compensatory rest rebound following rest deprivation, and can be induced by conventional hypnotics, diazepam and sodium pentobarbital. Collectively, these data indicate that melatonin is evolutionary conserved sleep-promoting agent in diurnal species and suggest that zebrafish provide an efficient animal model for studying the molecular mechanisms of sleep regulation and for screening new types of hypnotic medications.", 
    "154": "Despite numerous case reports on \"psychogenic fever,\" it remains uncertain how psychological stress raises core temperature and whether the rise in core temperature is a real fever or a hyperthermia. This article reviews studies on the psychological stress-induced rise in core temperature (PSRCT) in animals with the aim to facilitate studies on the mechanisms of so-called psychogenic fever in humans.", 
    "155": "To address this question, we reviewed the mechanisms and mediators of the PSRCT and classic conditioning of the fever response in animals.", 
    "156": "The PSRCT is not due to the increased locomotor activity during stress, and the magnitude of the PSRCT is the same in warm and cold environments, indicating that it is a centrally regulated rise in temperature due to an elevated thermoregulatory \"set point.\" The PSRCT caused by conventional psychological stress models, such as open-field stress, is attenuated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which block prostaglandin synthesis. On the other hand, the PSRCT elicited by an \"anticipatory anxiety stress\" is not inhibited by cyclooxygenase inhibitors but by benzodiazepines and serotonin Type 1A receptor agonists. The febrile response can be conditioned to neutral stimuli after paired presentation with unconditioned stimuli such as injection of lipopolysaccharide, a typical pyrogen.", 
    "157": "Most findings indicate that the PSRCT is a fever, a rise in the thermoregulatory set point. The PSRCT may occur through prostaglandin E2-dependent mechanisms and prostaglandin E2-independent, 5-HT-mediated mechanisms. The febrile response can be conditioned. Thus, these mechanisms might be involved in psychogenic fever in humans.", 
    "158": "The long-time benzodiazepine use by a considerable part of the population and its adverse consequences such as somatic and cognitive side effects, interactions with other drugs and alcohol and its possible impairment of quality of life has provoked a critical discussion about the practice of prescribing benzodiazepine and the information provided by physicians. We therefore investigated these issues in admitted patients of a general hospital. All patients having been admitted to the department of Internal Medicine and taking benzodiazepine were asked by means of a semi-structured interview, which was repeated after 1 year. In 90% of later benzodiazepine discontinuers and in almost 50% of benzodiazepine continuers, tranquilisers were first prescribed during hospital admission. Only 2% of all patients estimated the information provided by the prescribing physicians as satisfying and about 2/3 reported that they did not get any information at all. 66% of all patients were informed about dependency risks. This information was mainly provided by pharmacies, friends and patient information leaflets; only about 20% of all patients were informed by the prescribing physician. Guidelines for tranquiliser prescription only seem to have a poor impact on the clinical practice. The education of physicians about the risks of low-dose dependencies and especially about complementary therapy methods needs to be improved.", 
    "159": "The cerebral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam and diazepam were examined in chronically instrumented sheep via measurements of their arterio-venous concentration difference across the brain during and after 2-min i.v. infusions. Diazepam (30 mg) or midazolam (10 mg) were administered on 5 separate occasions to 4 sheep. For both drugs, rapid cerebral uptake occurred during the infusion, which quickly turned to elution in the postinfusion period. However, this process was more rapid for midazolam than diazepam. The cerebral pharmacokinetics of both was better described by a kinetic model with slight membrane limitation rather than flow limitation. For diazepam, the estimated brain:plasma partition coefficient was 2.67, and the first and second compartments filled with half-lives of 2.2 and 0.5 min, respectively. For midazolam, these values were 0.27, 0.26 and 1.34 min, respectively. In a subset of sheep, pulmonary arterial-arterial gradients were too small to measure suggesting limited metabolism and small distribution volumes for both drugs in the lungs. Simultaneous dynamic measurements of cerebral blood flow and algesimetry lagged behind both the arterial and sagittal sinus blood concentrations. The changes in cerebral blood flow were best described by a previously published a dynamic model that incorporated long half-lives for drug dissociation from the benzodiazepine receptor (13.3 and 5.5 min for midazolam and diazepam, respectively). Effect compartment modeling of the cerebral blood flow data showed apparent effect compartment half-lives (t1/2,keo) that were longer than the half-lives of cerebral equilibration."
