Alterations of endogenous neonatal allopregnanolone levels alter the localisation and function of GABA neurons in the adult brain and affect behaviour in adulthood. We have carried out research into the effects of an increase (AlloP administration) or a decrease (administration of finasteride, inhibitor of the AlloP synthesis) of neonatal AlloP levels during the fifth to ninth postnatal days in male Wistar rats on the novelty exploration (Boissier test) at adolescent ages (40 and 60 days old), and on the prepulse inhibition achievement in adulthood (85 days). We also investigated the role of a GABA(A) modulator (midazolam, 1, 1.75 or 2.5mg/kg body weight) in the long-lasting behavioural changes in adulthood (85 days). Results indicate that neonatal finasteride decreases both novelty-exploration (head-dipping and locomotion) and anxiety-relevant scores (the distance travelled in and the number of entries into the central zone) at adolescent age, along with a reduction in body weight and general locomotion. Also, neonatal AlloP administration decreases prepulse inhibition in adulthood. Prepulse inhibition disruption was only partially reproduced decreasing the neonatal AlloP levels by means of finasteride administration. Although there was no interaction between neonatal neurosteroid manipulation and adult benzodiazepine treatments, the effects of midazolam were dose-dependent: the lowest dose of midazolam increased whereas the highest disrupted the expected progressive reduction of the startle response (and the consequent improvement of the PPI percentage) after the gradual increase in prepulse intensity. Reduced prepulse inhibition of startle provides evidence of deficient sensorimotor gating in several disorders, including schizophrenia. Alterations of AlloP levels during maturation could partly explain the inter-individual differences shown by adult subjects in response to novelty (exploration) and in the sensorimotor gating and prepulse inhibition. Also, abrupt changes in neonatal levels of AlloP could be related to a susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

All the patients filled the observation table of CINV once a day on days 1-5, patients were instructed to fill the EORTC QLQ-C30 QoL observation table on day 0 and day 6. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) (without nausea and vomiting, no rescue therapy) for the acute period (24 h postchemotherapy), delayed period (days 2-5 postchemotherapy), the whole period (days 1-5 postchemotherapy). The second endpoint was QoL during chemotherapy administration, drug safety and toxicity.",

    "5": "Acute administration of antipsychotics elicits regionally distinct patterns of Fos expression in the rat brain. Stimulation of oxytocin (OXY) and vasopressin (AVP) release in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei indicates that antipsychotics may play a role in autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral processes. This study was focused to reveal the responsiveness of hypothalamic OXY- and AVP- producing magnocellular neurons, in terms of quantitative and topographical distinctions, to antipsychotics displaying different pharmacological profiles. Naive male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with haloperidol (1 mg/kg), clozapine (30 mg/kg), olanzapine (30 mg/kg), risperidone (2mg/kg), and vehicle (5% chremophor) and were sacrificed 60 min later by a fixative. Fos, Fos/OXY, and Fos/AVP labelings were visualized by immunohistochemistry in the SON, 5 accessory (ACS) cell groups, and 4 distinct PVN subdivisions using a computerized light microscope. Most apparent activation of single Fos, Fos/OXY, and Fos/AVP cells was induced by clozapine and olanzapine; effects of risperidone and haloperidol were substantially lower; no colocalizations were revealed in naive or vehicle treated control rats. The data indicate the existence of a substantial diversity in the stimulatory effect of the selected antipsychotics on quantity of Fos, Fos/OXY, and Fos/AVP immunostainings with the preferential action of the atypicals clozapine over olanzapine and little effects of risperidone and haloperidol. Variabilities in Fos distribution in the PVN, SON, and ACS induced by antipsychotics may be helpful to understand more precisely the extent of their extra-forebrain actions with possible presumption of their functional impact and side effect consequences.", 
    "6": "Shenmai injection (SMI), a mixture of Radix Ginseng and Radix Ophiopogonis, is one of the most popular herbal medicinal products and is widely used for the treatment of coronary atherosclerotic cardiopathy and viral myocarditis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SMI, in vivo and in vitro, on the metabolic activities of hepatic cytochrome CYP450 3A1/2, 2C6, 2E1, and 1A2 in rats. After a single or multiple pretreatment with SMI, the rats were administrated intravenously a cocktail containing midazolam (1 mg/kg), diclofenac (0.5 mg/kg), theophylline (1 mg/kg), and chlorzoxazone (0.5 mg/kg) as probe substrates of rat CYP450 3A1/2, 2C6, 1A2, and 2E1, respectively. Single and multiple SMI pretreatment to rats resulted in a rise of 33.8 % (p < 0.01) and 25.6 % (p < 0.01) in AUC for midazolam, and an increase in AUC for diclofenac by 14.7 % (p < 0.05) and 31.2 % (p < 0.01), respectively. However, the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone and theophylline in rats was not altered markedly. In rat liver microsomes, linear mixed-type inhibition of SMI against the enzyme activities of CYP3A1/2, CYP2C6, and CYP1A2 was shown with IC(50) values of 3.3 %, 2.0 %, and 3.1 % and K(i) values of 3.8 %, 1.5 %. and 1.9 %, respectively. These in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that SMI had the potential to inhibit the activities of hepatic CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C6, but might not significantly affect CYP1A2 and CYP2E1-mediated metabolism in rats.",

    "8": "Time-dependent inactivation (TDI) of human cytochromes P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a major cause of clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Human liver microsomes (HLM) are commonly used as an enzyme source for evaluating the inhibition of CYP3A4 by new chemical entities. The inhibition data can then be extrapolated to assess the risk of human DDIs. Using this approach, under- and overpredictions of in vivo DDIs have been observed. In the present study, human hepatocytes were used as an alternative to HLM. Hepatocytes incorporate the effects of other mechanisms of drug metabolism and disposition (i.e., phase II enzymes and transporters) that may modulate the effects of TDI on clinical DDIs. The in vitro potency (K(I) and k(inact)) of five known CYP3A4 TDI drugs (clarithromycin, diltiazem, erythromycin, verapamil, and troleandomycin) was determined in HLM (pooled, n = 20) and hepatocytes from two donors (D1 and D2), and the results were extrapolated to predict in vivo DDIs using a Simcyp population trial-based simulator. Compared with observed DDIs, the predictions derived from HLM appeared to be overestimated. The predictions based on TDI measured in hepatocytes were better correlated with the DDIs (n = 37) observed in vivo (R(2) = 0.601 for D1 and 0.740 for D2) than those from HLM (R(2) = 0.451). In addition, with the use of hepatocytes a greater proportion of the predictions were within a 2-fold range of the clinical DDIs compared with using HLM. These results suggest that DDI predictions from CYP3A4 TDI kinetics in hepatocytes could provide an alternative approach to balance HLM-based predictions that can sometimes substantially overestimate DDIs and possibly lead to erroneous conclusions about clinical risks.", 
    "9": "The plus-maze discriminative avoidance paradigm has been used to study the relationship between aversive memory and anxiety. The present study aims to verify if the elevated plus-maze can provide information about appetitive memory and anxiety-like behavior, through a task motivated by food reward. Animals were allowed to explore an elevated plus-maze and received reinforcement in one of the enclosed arms. In a test session performed 24h later, in the absence of reward, rats showed preference for the previously rewarded enclosed arm over the neutral enclosed arm. The administration of diazepam and pentylenetetrazole before training induced, respectively, anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects (as evaluated by open-arm exploration). Both drugs induced amnestic effects, i.e., lack of preference for the rewarded arm in the test session. The results suggest that appetitive memory can be influenced by anxiety levels as well. The plus-maze appetitive discrimination task seems to be a useful model to investigate the relationship between memory and anxiety.",

Hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis, and thermal degradation are evaluated by subjecting the drug substances to stress conditions. Successful separation of drugs from degradation products is achieved on a reversed-phase C(18) column using 75 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 4.0)-acetonitrile-methanol (55:40:5, v/v/v) as the mobile phase. The flow rate is 0.8 mL/min, and the detection wavelength is 227 nm. The method is validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, system suitability, and robustness. The utility of the procedure is verified by its application to marketed formulations that are subjected to accelerated stability studies. Good separation of the drugs and their degradation products is observed using this method. The products formed in marketed tablet dosage forms are similar to those formed in standard drug solutions under similar stress conditions.",

    "12": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells in humans. It is estimated that about 400 million people are affected by this deficiency. The G6PD enzyme catalyzes the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to antioxidants that protect cells against oxidative damage. A G6PD-deficient patient, therefore, lacks the ability to protect red blood cells against oxidative stresses from certain drugs, metabolic conditions, infections, and ingestion of fava beans. The following is a literature review, including disease background, pathophysiology, and clinical implications, to help guide the clinician in management of the G6PD-deficient patient. A literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, OMIM, and Google; this was supplemented by a search for selected authors. Keywords used were glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, anesthesia, analgesia, anxiolysis, management, favism, hemolytic anemia, benzodiazepines, codeine, codeine derivatives, ketamine, barbiturates, propofol, opioids, fentanyl, and inhalation anesthetics. Based on titles and abstracts, 23 papers and 1 website were identified. The highest prevalence of G6PD is reported in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the central and southern Pacific islands; however, G6PD deficiency has now migrated to become a worldwide disease. Numerous drugs, infections, and metabolic conditions have been shown to cause acute hemolysis of red blood cells in the G6PD-deficient patient, with the rare need for blood transfusion. Benzodiazepines, codeine/codeine derivatives, propofol, fentanyl, and ketamine were not found to cause hemolytic crises in the G6PD-deficient patient. The most effective management strategy is to prevent hemolysis by avoiding oxidative stressors. Thus, management for pain and anxiety should include medications that are safe and have not been shown to cause hemolytic crises, such as benzodiazepines, codeine/codeine derviatives, propofol, fentanyl, and ketamine. The authors of this article make 5 particular recommendations: (1) Anyone suspected of G6PD deficiency should be screened; (2) exposure to oxidative stressors in these individuals should be avoided; (3) these patients should be informed of risks along with signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic crisis; (4) the clinician should be able to identify both laboratory and clinical signs of hemolysis; and finally, (5) if an acute hemolytic crisis is identified, the patient should be admitted for close observation and care.", 
    "13": "Insomnia has mainly been treated with the hypnotic benzodiazepine (BZ). Recent studies have revealed the role and mechanisms of BZ receptors and have led to the development of non-BZ hypnotics. The chemical structures of non-BZ hypnotics differ from that of BZ; these hypnotics selectively bind to the omega 1 receptor of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-BZ receptor complex. Because the omega 2 BZ receptors have adverse effects such as muscle relaxant actions, non-BZ hypnotics have lesser adverse effects than BZ. Antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antihistamines are also used for the treatment of insomnia in patients with other medical problems such as schizophrenia and depression. Currently, novel hypnotics are being developed with the manipulation of neurotransmitters and non-GABAergic receptors such as the melatonin and serotonin receptors.",

Titration experiments with constructs representing residues 1-120 or 1-145 of the OSCP reveals that (a) 1 binds to a region of the protein, at the minimum, comprising residues M51, L56, K65, V66, K75, K77, and N92, and (b) binding of 1 induces conformational changes in the OSCP. Control experiments employing a variant of 1 in which a key binding element on the small molecule was deleted; it had no perturbational effect on the spectra of the OSCP, which indicates that the observed changes with 1 represent specific binding interactions. Collectively, these data suggest that 1 might inhibit the enzyme through an allosteric mechanism where binding results in conformational changes that perturb the OSCP-F(1) interface resulting in disrupted communication between the peripheral stalk and the F(1)-domain of the enzyme.", 
    "17": "Studies have suggested that inducing mild hypothermia improves neurologic outcomes after traumatic brain injury, major stroke, cardiac arrest, or exertional heat illness. While infusion of cold normal saline is a simple and inexpensive method for reducing core temperature, human cold-defense mechanisms potentially make this route stressful or ineffective. We hypothesized that intravenous administration of diazepam during a rapid infusion of 30 mL.kg-1 of cold (4 degrees C) 0.9% saline to healthy subjects would be more comfortable and reduce core body temperature more than the administration of cold saline alone. Fifteen subjects received rapidly infused cold (4 degrees C) 0.9% saline. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive, intravenously, 20 mg diazepam (HIGH), 10 mg diazepam (LOW), or placebo (CON). Main outcomes were core temperature, skin temperature, and oxygen consumption. Data for the main outcomes were analyzed with generalized estimating equations to identify differences in group, time, or a group x time interaction. Core temperature decreased in all groups (CON, 1.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C; LOW, 1.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C; HIGH, 1.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C), while skin temperature was unchanged. Mean (95% CI) oxygen consumption was 315.3 (253.8, 376.9) mL.kg-1.min-1 in the CON group, 317.9 (275.5, 360.3) in the LOW group, and 226.1 (216.4, 235.9) in the HIGH group. Significant time and group x time interaction was observed for core temperature and oxygen consumption (p < 0.001). Administration of high-dose diazepam resulted in decreased oxygen consumption during cold saline infusion, suggesting that 20 mg of intravenous diazepam may reduce the shivering threshold without compromising respiratory or cardiovascular function.", 
    "18": "Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has been demonstrated to be useful for in vivo sampling in pharmacokinetic studies. In this study, a single time-point kinetic calibration for in vivo dynamic monitoring was developed by simplification of the laborious multiple time-point kinetic calibration, based on the independent desorption kinetics of the preloaded standards from SPME fibers with the changing analyte concentrations. The theoretical foundation and practical application conditions, such as the replicate numbers, the optimal time-point for desorption, and the sampling time, were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of using regular standards rather than deuterated ones for the kinetic calibration was justified by comparing to the data obtained using the deuterated standards. All the methods were verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results from in vivo SPME were validated by the blood drawing and chemical assay. These simplified calibration methods improved the quantitative applications of SPME for dynamic monitoring and in vivo sampling, enhance the multiplexing capability and automatic potentials for high throughput analysis, and decrease expenses on reagents and instruments.",

    "25": "The extent to which a non-sedative dose of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) is able to modify the behavioral responses toward a predator odor was assessed in juvenile rats. Play behavior was suppressed and defensive behaviors were enhanced in the presence of a collar previously worn by a cat, when tested 24 h later in the same context as that where the exposure occurred, and when tested in a context different than that in which the exposure occurred for up to 3 h after exposure. CDP had no effect on the ability of cat odor to suppress play when rats were tested in the presence of the odor or when tested 24 h later in the same context where that exposure occurred. When rats were exposed to a worn cat collar in their home cage and tested in a different context CDP attenuated the ability of cat odor to reduce one measure of play (nape contacts) but not another measure (pins). Rats had an opportunity to hide during testing and CDP either decreased hiding or increased risk assessment from within the hide box in all of the testing scenarios. These data suggest that CDP can alter the defensive strategy used by juvenile rats that are confronted with a predatory threat and can also lead to an earlier return to pre-threat levels of playfulness when that threat becomes less immediate.",

Several quantitative structure-toxicity (lethal oral dose for mouse) relationship (QSTR) models for 54 benzodiazepine derivatives have been developed. The molecular structure of these compounds was energetically optimized by molecular mechanics calculations. To the lowest energy conformations thus obtained, quantum chemical calculations (RM1 approach) were applied to finally optimize the structures. Several structural descriptors, volumes, molecular surface area, hydrophobicities and quantum chemical descriptors were calculated from the minimized structures. Multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm for variable selection, artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs) and partial least squares (PLS) have been employed. Few satisfactory MLR models with predictive power were obtained. Nonlinear modelling methods of ANNs and SVMs gave somewhat better models than those obtained by MLR using same set of descriptors. Additional information on the factors which influence the benzodiazepine toxicity was given by PLS. The obtained models can be used for a rough evaluation of benzodiazepine toxicity.",

In this study, we sought to understand the influence of multiaccess infusion device properties (dead space volume and antireflux valve [ARV]) on drug delivery during multi-infusion therapy.", 
    "38": "Infusion sets differing in length, dead space volume, and presence of an ARV were assessed. Three drugs were infused simultaneously through different access points, and their concentrations were obtained using UV spectrophotometric analysis of the effluent. Different infusion configurations were compared by assessing (1) the amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time, (2) the mean amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time during the steady-state infusion (mass flow rate plateau), and (3) flow change efficiency calculated from the ratio of the area under the experimental instant mass flow rate curve to the area corresponding to theoretical instant mass flow rate curve.", 
    "39": "Infusion sets with lower dead space volumes offered significantly higher flow change efficiency (53.0% +/- 15.4% with a dead space volume equal to 0.046 mL 5 min after the start of infusion) than infusion sets with higher dead space volume (5.6% +/- 8.2% with a dead space volume equal to 6.16 mL), whatever the flow rate changes. Even in case of large dead space volumes, the presence of an ARV significantly increased the mass flow rate plateau (from 92.4% to 99.3% of the theoretical plateau without and with the presence of an ARV, respectively).", 
    "40": "Multi-infusion therapy induces perturbation in drug delivery. These perturbations (lag time, backflow, and bolus) could be reduced by using infusion sets including very low dead space volume and an ARV.",

In prior work, a reduction in flurazepam's antiseizure efficacy was not observed 24h after forcing Balb/c mice to swim for up to 10 min in ambient temperature water. Thus, we wondered if a stress-induced reduction would be observed after forcing mice to swim for up to 10 min in cold (6 degrees C) water, a more severe stress. The current data show that 24 h after exposure to this stress, the ability of flurazepam to raise the threshold voltage for the elicitation of tonic hindlimb extension in the Balb/c mouse strain was reduced. The genetically inbred Balb/c mouse strain is emerging as an interesting animal model in which to study interactions of stress and genetic factors that affect endogenous neurotransmission mediated by l-glutamate and GABA at the NMDA and GABA(A) receptor complexes, respectively.",

Both methanolic and aqueous extracts were tested for protective effects on the PC12 cell line, free radical scavenging properties and neurological activities (inhibition of MAO-A and acetylcholinesterase enzymes and affinity to the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor). The results suggest that the plant has a significant (P < 0.05) protective effect on hydrogen peroxide induced toxicity in PC12 cells. The radical scavenging properties were also investigated in cells and in cell free systems, where this plant was shown to be a good free radical scavenger. The MAO-A bioassay was also performed to detect possible antidepressant activities demonstrating that both extracts inhibited this enzyme, which has a key role in neurotransmitters metabolism. However, no activity was detected in the acetylcholinesterase and GABA assays. In general, the methanolic extract was more effective than the aqueous.",

    "47": "Scopolamine, an anticholinergic drug, is reported to produce amnesia by interference of long term potentiation and has been used for discerning the efficacy of various antiamnesic drugs. The intoxication with anticholinergics and benzodiazepines tend to produce neurodegeneration which cause memory deficits. Our earlier reports have shown the antiamnesic drug, B. monniera to be capable of alleviating diazepam induced memory deficits. We have now tested how scopolamine affects downstream signaling molecules of long term potentiation and if B. monniera can also modulate the scopolamine induced amnesia. We used Morris water maze scale to test the amnesic effect of scopolamine and its reversal by B. monniera. Rota-rod test was used to screen muscle coordination activity of mice before water maze investigations were carried out. The results showed that scopolamine downregulated protein kinase C and iNOS without affecting cAMP, protein kinase A, calmodulin, MAP kinase, nitrite, CREB and pCREB. B. monniera reversed the scopolamine induced amnesia by significantly improving calmodulin and by partially attenuating protein kinase C and pCREB. These observations suggest involvement of calmodulin in evoking antiamnesic effects of B. monniera.",

Vitamin E may increase the production of CYP3A4 in the liver, and this could lead to an increase in drug metabolism, potentially lowering the efficacy of therapeutic drugs. We hypothesized that upregulation of CYP3A4 by alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOH) would decrease the plasma concentration of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. Baseline metabolism of midazolam (1 mg intravenously) was determined in 12 healthy subjects before randomization into 2 groups of 6 to receive either RRR-alpha-TOH (750 IU/d) or placebo for 3 weeks. At completion, subjects were given an additional 1 mg intravenous bolus of midazolam. Plasma midazolam, 1-hydroxy-midazolam, and urinary alpha-TOH metabolite excretion were measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Serum alpha-TOH was measured using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Serum alpha-TOH increased by 100% (P = 0.002) and urinary alpha-TOH metabolite excretion increased 20-fold in the treatment group versus placebo (P = 0.001). There was no effect on the area under time curve of midazolam in subjects taking alpha-TOH compared with placebo. These findings do not support the hypothesis that alpha-TOH supplementation interferes with hepatic CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism.",

    "58": "A 9-day-old, 24-week gestational age male neonate on high-frequency oscillatory mechanical ventilation was experiencing severe agitation refractory to high-dose intravenous narcotics and benzodiazepines. Since the infant's respiratory stability was reliant on adequate sedation, he was given dexmedetomidine after several days of suboptimal response to escalation of standard agents. Treatment prior to dexmedetomidine included continuous-infusion fentanyl 10 microg/kg/h, intravenous lorazepam 0.6 mg/kg every 4 hours, intermittent doses of both lorazepam and midazolam as needed, and a single bolus dose of phenobarbital. The patient calmed markedly during the dexmedetomidine loading dose infusion and remained adequately sedated while the drug was continued. The dexmedetomidine infusion allowed weaning of mechanical ventilation settings and eventual extubation of the infant, as well as rapid tapering of other sedative medications. The maximum dexmedetomidine infusion rate was 0.7 microg/kg/h, and total duration of therapy was 19 days. No significant adverse effects were directly attributed to dexmedetomidine use during this time.",

    "60": "Dexmedetomidine was an effective sedative and analgesic in a 24-week gestational age neonate treated for refractory agitation while on mechanical ventilation. Based on its documented efficacy for pain and sedation and its favorable adverse effect profile, dexmedetomidine warrants further study as first-line or adjunct therapy with narcotics for sedation in ventilated newborns.", 
    "61": "We report on a serious side effect in a severely depressed 55-year-old woman, who presented an erythematous pigmented skin rash on the whole body under combination treatment with antidepressants, atypical antipsychotic drugs, the mood stabilizer lithium and the lipid-lowering drug pravastatin. The skin rash effect was most probably due, in first line, to olanzapine, but the cutaneous skin condition was triggered and aggravated by pravastatin, a 3-hydoxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A-(HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor, and lithium medication. The allergic reaction started to develop after co-administration of pravastatin. Therefore, the combination of atypical antipsychotics with statins should be carefully monitored and the benefits and disadvantages should be balanced.", 
    "62": "CYP3A4 is an important determinant of drug-drug interactions. In this study, we evaluated whether cytochrome P450 3A knockout mice [Cyp3a(-/-)] and CYP3A4 transgenic (CYP3A4-Tg) mice can be used to study drug-drug interactions in the liver and intestine. Triazolam was used as a probe drug because it is a highly specific CYP3A substrate and not a P-glycoprotein substrate. Triazolam metabolism was profoundly reduced in Cyp3a(-/-) mice both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies revealed clear species differences in humans and mice, but triazolam metabolism in microsomes derived from CYP3A4-Tg \"humanized\" mice closely resembled that in human microsomes. It is interesting to note that studies with tissue-specific CYP3A4-Tg mice revealed that intestinal CYP3A4 has a major impact on oral triazolam exposure, whereas the effect of hepatic CYP3A4 was limited. To mimic a drug-drug interaction, we coadministered triazolam with the prototypical CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole, which increased triazolam exposure in all the CYP3A-proficient mouse strains but not in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. We further found that the anticancer drug gefitinib is a potent stimulator of 1'-OH triazolam formation in vitro. It is noteworthy that we could also show in vivo stimulation of triazolam metabolism by gefitinib, resulting in a lower oral triazolam exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo example of direct stimulation of CYP3A4 activity after oral drug administration. Overall, this study illustrates how Cyp3a(-/-) and CYP3A4-Tg mice can be used to study drug-drug interactions. The data clarify that for drugs that are not P-glycoprotein substrates, intestinal metabolism also can be more important than hepatic metabolism after oral administration.",

Psychosis and mood disorders have been described in the literature. This case report is of a 30 year old man with malignant melanoma stage 3a who was receiving adjuvant alpha 2b interferon and developed a manic episode two weeks post switching after one month of treatment on a high dose to a low dose. There was no previous psychiatric illness and no known family history of mental illness. This is in keeping with previous reports that mania has been observed in patients undergoing interferon treatment especially after significant dose-reduction or treatment breaks. Mania induced by interferon responds well to antimanic drugs .Since interferon alpha 2b is now commonly used in the treatment of malignant melanoma and other conditions, the need to be aware of its neuropsychiatric complications is essential.",

In this work, we evaluated the effect of acute and chronic administration of fluoxetine, olanzapine and the combination of fluoxetine/olanzapine on creatine kinase (CK) activity in the brain of rats. For acute treatment, adult male Wistar rats received one single injection of olanzapine (3 or 6 mg/kg) and/or fluoxetine (12.5 or 25mg/kg). For chronic treatment, adult male Wistar rats received daily injections of olanzapine (3 or 6 mg/kg) and/or fluoxetine (12.5 or 25mg/kg) for 28 days. In the present study we observed that acute administration of OLZ inhibited CK activity in cerebellum and prefrontal cortex. The acute administration of FLX inhibited creatine kinase in cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex. In the chronic treatment, when the animals were killed 2h after the last injection a decrease in creatine kinase activity after FLX administration, alone or in combination with OLZ, in cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex of rats occurred. However, when the animals were killed 24h after the last injection, we found no alterations in the enzyme. Although it is difficult to extrapolate our findings to the human condition, the inhibition of creatine kinase activity by these drugs may be associated to the occurrence of some side effects of OLZ and FLX.", 
    "69": "CVT-10216 is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of ALDH-2 that reduces excessive alcohol drinking. Anxiety plays a role in alcoholism. The present study asks whether CVT-10216 has anxiolytic properties, as reflected in social interaction behavior in four unrelated rodent models: endogenous anxiety-like behavior in na\u00efve Fawn-Hooded rats, repeated alcohol-withdrawal-induced anxiety, restraint stress-induced anxiety and drug-induced anxiety. CVT-10216 counteracted anxiety in all models except that produced by the 5-HT(2C) agonist, mCPP. CVT-10216 exhibited both acute and prophylactic inhibitions of repeated alcohol-withdrawal-induced anxiety. Importantly, anxiogenic behavior induced by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, DMCM, was counteracted dose-dependently by CVT-10216. Thus, a non-addictive selective inhibitor of ALDH-2 has both anxiolytic and antidipsotropic properties, which may be dependent, in part on the involvement of the GABA-benzodiazepine system.", 
    "70": "An isoindolin-1-one derivate, JM-1232(-), was recently developed as a sedative and hypnotic agent with a strong affinity for the central benzodiazepine binding site of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of JM-1232(-) on the cardiovascular and sympathetic functions of conscious rats. We investigated the effect of JM-1232(-) on the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), baroreflex activity, and plasma catecholamine levels in conscious rats. The intravenous (i.v.) administration of JM-1232(-) (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg/min) for 20 min decreased MAP and increased HR in intact rats. In sinoaortic denervated (SAD) rats, JM-1232(-) decreased MAP and HR. A decrease in MAP induced by JM-1232(-) was prevented by pre-treatment with hexamethonium and enhanced by SAD. An increase in HR induced by JM-1232(-) was prevented by pre-treatment with atropine, propranolol, or hexamethonium. A decrease in MAP and an increase in HR induced by JM-1232(-) were antagonized by co-administration of flumazenil. A high dose of JM-1232(-) decreased the plasma norepinephrine concentration, and a subdepressor dose of JM-1232(-) did not affect the baroreceptor reflex. These results show that the i.v. administration of JM-1232(-) decreased MAP mediated by benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "71": "Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are very potent and most promising anti-AIDS drugs that specifically inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). However, to a great extent, the efficacy of NNRTI drugs is impaired by rapid emergence of drug-resistance mutations. Fortunately, detailed analysis of a wide range of crystal structures of HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes together with data on drug resistance mutations has identified factors important for design of inhibitors and resilience to mutations, such as, exhibiting conformational flexibility and positional adaptability of NNRTIs, forming extensive main chain hydrogen bonding, targeting highly conserved residues in HIV-1 RT and possessing unconventional mechanisms for NNRTI-mediated inhibition of RT. Besides, the plasticity of NNRTIs binding pocket (NNIBP) also provides a broad space for the discovery of new generations of NNRTIs. For instance, the composite binding pocket, integrated all available crystal structure information about the NNRTI binding site of HIV RT, was demonstrated to be an effective tool to better understand the flexible nature of the binding pocket and to identify specific inhibitors. The RT/solvent interface proved to be an attractive site for incorporating a moiety to improve water solubility and pharmacokinetics or introducing a second pharmacophore to construct multifunctional ligand. Totally, the characterization of NNRTIs and NNIBP may help in the design of more effective drugs that are potent toward wild type and drug-resistant strains of RT. In this paper we attempt to translate the general knowledge gained from a large number of related literature into a set of medicinal chemistry strategies to improve the drug resistance profile of NNRTIs.", 
    "72": "The tRNA-modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is essential for the pathogenic mechanism of Shigella flexneri, the causing agent of the bacterial diarrheal disease shigellosis. Herein, the synthesis of a new class of rationally designed 6-amino-imidazo[4,5-g]quinazolin-8(7H)-one- (lin-benzoguanine) based inhibitors of TGT are reported. In order to accommodate a small hydrophobic crevice opening near the binding site of ribose-34, 2-aminoethyl substituents were introduced in position 4 of the heterocyclic scaffold. For this purpose, a synthetic sequence consisting of iodination, Suzuki cross-coupling, hydroboration, Mitsunobu reaction, and Gabriel synthesis was employed, furnishing a primary amine that served as a common intermediate for the preparation of a series of derivatives. The resulting ligands displayed very low inhibition constants, down to K(i)=2 nM. Substantial additional inhibitory potency is gained by interaction of terminal lipophilic groups attached to the substituent at position 4 with the hydrophobic crevice shaped by Val45 and Leu68. At the same time, the secondary ammonium center in the substituent displaces a cluster of water molecules, solvating the catalytic residues Asp102 and Asp280, without loss in binding affinity. In addition, a synthetic intermediate with an unusual 3,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydroimidazo[4,5-g][1,3]benzodiazepine core, as confirmed by X-ray analysis, is reported.", 
    "73": "The number of well-designed placebo-controlled studies on pharmacological treatment of borderline personality disorder has been small. We present a breakdown of results of placebo-controlled pharmacological studies, sorting target symptoms into the trait dimensions of affective instability, anxiety inhibition, cognitive-perceptual disturbances, and impulsivity-aggression. Twenty randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological trials studying typical and atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines were included. A relative measure of the weight of an outcome was determined by (1) dividing the number of positive comparisons for a drug class by the total number of comparisons of all drugs of all classes for each dimension and (2) dividing the number of positive comparisons for a drug class by the total number of comparisons for that particular drug class for that trait dimension. Antipsychotics (neuroleptics and atypicals) had the most evidence for each of the traits with both methods. Our results are compared with the results of 2 meta-analyses, 1 guideline set, and 1 other systematic review. We found little concordance across these studies. We propose a consortium to discuss guidelines for future studies, including agreement as to what should be measured to determine the outcome and adoption of standardized instruments to measure that outcome.", 
    "74": "A major problem related to hypnotic drug use is residual sedation the morning after bedtime administration. This constitutes a particular safety hazard for patients who have to drive a car the next morning. Information on the severity of residual effects is mainly derived from studies conducted with young healthy volunteers. However, most users of hypnotics are older people who may be more sensitive to drug effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the residual effects the morning after evening doses of temazepam 20 mg and zopiclone 7.5 mg on driving performance in healthy elderly drivers. Eighteen healthy elderly drivers (10 females and 8 males; mean age, 64.3 years) participated in a double-blind, 3-way crossover study. Treatments were single oral doses of temazepam 20 mg, zopiclone 7.5 mg, and placebo administered at bedtime. Subjects performed a standardized highway driving test between 10 and 11 hours after hypnotic intake. Before and after the driving test, cognitive performance was assessed. Driving performance did not differ between temazepam and placebo but was significantly impaired after zopiclone 7.5 mg (P < 0.002). The results of the laboratory tests were in line with the effects on driving of both hypnotics. Temazepam 20 mg is unlikely to impair driving 10 hours or more after bedtime administration in healthy elderly aged 75 years or younger. Zopiclone 7.5 mg moderately impairs driving in the elderly at least until 11 hours after administration. The magnitude of impairing effects in the elderly was comparable with those found previously in younger volunteers.",

This laboratory study evaluated the hypothesis that incremental dosing of triazolam produces dose-dependent central nervous system depression that is profound and long lasting. Forty-nine healthy adults between the ages of 21 and 39 years, not receiving dental treatment, were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 12) or 1 of 3 triazolam groups (0.25-mg single dose, n = 12; 0.5 mg divided between 2 equal doses for 60 minutes, n = 12; or 0.75 mg divided among 3 doses for 90 minutes, n = 13). Plasma triazolam concentrations were determined. Bispectral index (BIS) and the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale were used to assess sedation. Plasma triazolam concentrations increased with time in all subjects, with Tmax and Cmax both increasing dose dependently. Compared with placebo, all dosing paradigms produced dose-dependent BIS suppression and sedation. The single dose of 0.25 mg reached its peak BIS suppression at 90 (81 +/- 7) minutes and sedation at 120 (3.6 +/- 0.5) minutes and returned to baseline before 360 minutes. In contrast, incremental dosing of 0.5 and 0.75 mg produced profound and long-lasting BIS suppression and sedation that did not plateau until either 180 or 210 minutes as measured by the BIS index (67 +/- 14 and 60 +/- 16 at 0.5 and 0.75 mg, respectively) and 150 minutes as measured by the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (3.2 +/- 1.0 and 2.7 +/- 0.4 at 0.5 and 0.75 mg, respectively). These data more fully characterize the effects of incremental dosing with sublingual triazolam and provide additional insight for discharge safety recommendations.",

    "84": "Patients with neurologic disorders commonly experience sleep dysfunction and psychiatric disorders. The most common sleep dysfunction is insomnia, which is a primary symptom in 30% to 90% of psychiatric disorders. Insomnia and fatigue are prominent symptoms of anxiety disorders and major depression that may occur in patients who are treated but have residual sleep dysfunction. Anxiety and depressive disorders account for 40% to 50% of all cases of chronic insomnia. It is also recognized that primary insomnia and other primary sleep disorders produce symptoms that are similar to those reported by patients with psychiatric disorders. A clinician must judge whether sleep deprivation causes mood disturbance or whether depressive or anxiety disorder represents the primary reason for sleep dysfunction. When insomnia is comorbid with mild to moderate depression, therapy should begin with bedtime dosing of sedating antidepressants such as mirtazapine, nefazodone, or tricyclic antidepressants, which are preferred because of their sedative effects. Often side effects limit their usefulness. Intervention for chronic insomnia is similar in nonpsychiatric and psychiatric patients. Behavioral therapies, particularly multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes show significant long-term efficacy as treatments for chronic insomnia. The most studied pharmacologic agents to treat insomnia are sedative hypnotic agents, particularly those that are active through the benzodiazepine receptor-GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) complex, such as benzodiazepines, eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem. Melatonin and the melatonin-receptor agonist ramelteon have not had adequate study in psychiatric patients to define their use, but small studies suggest benefit. Prescription of adjunctive trazodone (50-150 mg) is a common clinical practice to treat comorbid insomnia during antidepressant therapy, but published data are surprisingly limited, considering its frequent use. Although there has been insufficient research on the use of atypical antipsychotic agents in severe insomnia, psychiatrists use quetiapine, olanzapine, or others to lessen agitation that disrupts sleep. When insomnia or hypersomnia continue even as mood, anxiety, or thought disorders improve with standard therapy, the physician should consider the potential presence of underlying sleep disorders.", 
    "85": "Identifying abnormal nocturnal eating is critically important for patient care and public health. Obesity is a global pandemic and a leading cause of preventable mortality in the United States, with more than 100,000 deaths annually. Normally, nighttime energy homeostasis is maintained, despite an absence of food intake, through appetite suppression and alterations in glucose metabolism that result in stable energy stores. Two conditions break this nighttime fast and are associated with weight gain as well as medical and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) is characterized by isolated nocturnal eating, whereas the night-eating syndrome (NES) is a circadian delay in meal timing leading to evening hyperphagia, nocturnal eating, and morning anorexia. Recently, SRED has been associated with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist zolpidem. Both SRED and NES are treatable and represent potentially reversible forms of obesity. In SRED, the antiseizure medication topiramate and dopaminergics have both demonstrated promising results. Nocturnal eating associated with NES has responded well to sertraline.", 
    "86": "Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are one of the major causes of adverse events in pharmacotherapy, and systematic prediction of the clinical relevance of DDIs is an issue of significant clinical importance. In a previous study, total exposure changes of many substrate drugs of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 caused by coadministration of inhibitor drugs were successfully predicted by using in vivo information. In order to exploit these predictions in daily pharmacotherapy, the clinical significance of the pharmacokinetic changes needs to be carefully evaluated. The aim of the present study was to construct a pharmacokinetic interaction significance classification system (PISCS) in which the clinical significance of DDIs was considered with pharmacokinetic changes in a systematic manner. Furthermore, the classifications proposed by PISCS were compared in a detailed manner with current alert classifications in the product labelling or the summary of product characteristics used in Japan, the US and the UK.", 
    "87": "A matrix table was composed by stratifying two basic parameters of the prediction: the contribution ratio of CYP3A4 to the oral clearance of substrates (CR), and the inhibition ratio of inhibitors (IR). The total exposure increase was estimated for each cell in the table by associating CR and IR values, and the cells were categorized into nine zones according to the magnitude of the exposure increase. Then, correspondences between the DDI significance and the zones were determined for each drug group considering the observed exposure changes and the current classification in the product labelling. Substrate drugs of CYP3A4 selected from three therapeutic groups, i.e. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), calcium-channel antagonists/blockers (CCBs) and benzodiazepines (BZPs), were analysed as representative examples. The product labelling descriptions of drugs in Japan, US and UK were obtained from the websites of each regulatory body.", 
    "88": "Among 220 combinations of drugs investigated, estimated exposure changes were more than 5-fold for 41 combinations in which ten combinations were not alerted in the product labelling at least in one country; these involved buspirone, nisoldipine and felodipine as substrates, and ketoconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin and nefazodone as inhibitors. For those drug combinations, the alert classifications were anticipated as potentially inappropriate. In the current product labelling, many inter-country differences were also noted. Considering the relationships between previously observed exposure changes and the current alert classifications, the boundaries between 'contraindication' and 'warning/caution' were determined as a 7-fold exposure increase for statins and CCBs, and as a 4-fold increase for BZPs. PISCS clearly discriminated these drug combinations in accordance with the determined boundaries. Classifications by PISCS were expected to be valid even for future drugs because the classifications were made by zones, not by designating individual drugs.", 
    "89": "The present analysis suggested that many current alert classifications were potentially inappropriate especially for drug combinations where pharmacokinetics had not been evaluated. It is expected that PISCS would contribute to constructing a leak-less alerting system for a broad range of pharmacokinetic DDIs. Further validation of PISCS is required in clinical studies with key drug combinations, and its extension to other CYP and metabolizing enzymes remains to be achieved.",

Many cells spontaneously fired action potentials at a rate proportional to the level of neuronal depolarization. The reversal potential for GABA-activated currents, assessed by cell-attached single channel recordings, was close to the resting membrane potential. All spontaneously firing neurons recorded in cell-attached mode or imaged with biphoton microscopy were inhibited by GABA. Spontaneous epileptiform activity in the form of recurrent population bursts was suppressed by glutamate receptor antagonists, the GABA(A) receptor agonist isoguvacine, and the positive allosteric GABA(A) modulator diazepam. Blockade of GABA(A) receptors aggravated spontaneous epileptiform activity. The NKCC1 antagonist bumetanide had little effect on epileptiform activity.", 
    "93": "SWS cortical neurons have a relatively depolarized resting membrane potential and spontaneously fire action potentials that may contribute to increased network excitability. In contrast to previous data depicting excitatory and proconvulsive actions of GABA in certain pediatric and adult epilepsies, GABA plays mainly an inhibitory and anticonvulsive role in SWS pediatric cortex.", 
    "94": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Schisandra lignan extract (SLE) with short- and long-term pretreatment on regulating rat hepatic and intestinal CYP3A for a comprehensive evaluation of metabolism-based herb-drug interactions. Inhibitory effects of SLE and its major components on rat CYP3A were confirmed in both hepatic and intestinal microsomal incubation systems. After a single dose of SLE pretreatment, higher C(max) and area under the concentration-time curves from zero to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) values were observed for intragastric midazolam (MDZ), whereas those for the intravenous MDZ were little changed. The mechanism-based inhibition of SLE toward CYP3A was further confirmed in vivo, characterized with a recovery half-life of 38 h. In contrast, SLE long-term treatment enhanced both hepatic (2.5-fold) and intestinal (4.0-fold) CYP3A protein expression and promoted the in vivo clearance of MDZ. When MDZ was coadministered with SLE after a consecutive long-term treatment, the AUC(0-infinity) value of MDZ was still lower than that of the control group, suggesting a much stronger inducing than inhibiting effect of SLE toward CYP3A. Furthermore, the intragastric administration of SLE exhibited a more intensive regulating effect toward intestinal than hepatic CYP3A, which could be partially explained by the relatively high exposures of lignans in the intestine. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive map for showing the complicated effects of SLE and its components on regulating rat CYP3A. The important findings are that SLE possesses a much stronger inducing than inhibiting effect on CYP3A, as well as a more intensive regulating effect on intestinal than hepatic CYP3A.",

Dysfunctions of this mechanism are involved in the pathophysiology of different psychiatric disorders. mGlu(8) deficient mice have been previously investigated in a range of studies, but the results are contradictory and there are still many open questions. Therefore, we tested mGlu(8)-deficient animals in different behavioral tasks that are commonly used in neuropsychiatric research. Our results show a robust contextual fear deficit in mGlu(8)-deficient mice. Furthermore, novel object recognition, chlordiazepoxide-facilitated extinction of operant conditioning and the acoustic startle response were attenuated by mGlu(8) deficiency. We found no changes in sensory processing, locomotor activity, prepulse inhibition, phencyclidine-induced changes in locomotion or prepulse inhibition, operant conditioning, conditioned fear to a discrete cue or in animal models of innate fear and post-traumatic stress disorder. We conclude that mGlu(8) might be a potential target for disorders with pathophysiological changes in brain areas where mGlu(8) modulates glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) transmission.

The use of adaptol in dosage 500 mg 2 times daily during one month resulted in the decrease of hyperactivity and impulsivity and did not exert any influence on attention and reaction time. The authors emphasize the importance of this fact due to its relation to side-effects which are often seen in the treatment with benzodiazepine tranquilizers.

    "110": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder maintained by cancer stem cells. To target this population, we investigated the mechanism of action of BMS-214662, developed as a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) and unique in inducing apoptosis in these cells. By contrast, a related congener and equally effective FTI, BMS-225975 does not induce apoptosis, indicating a novel mechanism of action. BMS-214662 significantly and selectively induced apoptosis in primitive CD34(+)38(-) CML compared with normal cells. Apoptosis proceeded via the intrinsic pathway: Bax conformational changes, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c, and caspase-9/3 activation were noted. Up-regulation of protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta), down-regulation of E2F1, and phosphorylation of cyclin A-associated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 preceded these changes. Cotreatment of CML CD34(+) and CD34(+)38(-) cells with PKC modulators, bryostatin-1, or hispidin markedly decreased these early events and the subsequent apoptosis. None of these events was elicited by BMS-214662 in normal CD34(+) cells or by BMS-225975 in CML CD34(+) cells. These data suggest that BMS-214662 selectively elicits a latent apoptotic pathway in CML stem cells that is initiated by up-regulation of PKCbeta and mediated by Bax activation, providing a molecular framework for development of novel therapeutics.", 
    "111": "Prior research suggests that SSRIs may have greater efficacy for psychic compared to somatic anxiety, while benzodiazepines show greater somatic efficacy. The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin (PGB) in treating psychic and somatic symptoms of anxiety. Data were combined from six short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials of PGB in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The following PGB daily dose groups were studied: 150 mg (n=210), 300-450 mg (n=455), and 600 mg (n=406), benzodiazepines (6 mg/d lorazepam and 1.5 mg/d alprazolam, n=299), vs. placebo (n=484). Changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) psychic and somatic anxiety factors and individual items were analysed. Treatment with 300-600 mg PGB significantly improved both the HAMA psychic and somatic anxiety factors. In contrast, treatment with 150 mg PGB appeared to be less effective, achieving significance only on the psychic anxiety factor. PGB (300-450 mg) was associated with significant improvement on 13 out of 14 HAMA items, while treatment with 600 mg PGB was associated with significant improvement in 10 out of 14 HAMA items. Treatment with benzodiazepines was also associated with significant improvement in both psychic and somatic anxiety factors, with significant improvement occurring in 5 out of 14 HAMA items. The results of this pooled analysis indicate that both PGB and benzodiazepines had significant efficacy in treating both HAMA psychic and somatic anxiety. A dose-response effect was evident for PGB that reached a plateau at a dose of 300 mg/d.", 
    "112": "The current debate about the side effects of induction agents, e.g. possible adrenal suppression through etomidate, emphasizes the relevance of choosing the correct induction agent in septic patients. However, cardiovascular depression is still the most prominent adverse effect of these agents, and might be especially hazardous in septic patients presenting with a biventricular cardiac dysfunction--or so-called septic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, we tested the dose-response direct cardiac effects of clinically available induction agents in an isolated septic rat heart model.",

Hearts (n = 50) were isolated and randomly assigned to five groups, each receiving etomidate, s(+)-ketamine, midazolam, propofol, or methohexitone at concentrations of 1 x 10-8 to 1 x 10-4 M. Left ventricular pressure, contractility and lusitropy, and coronary flow were measured. Cardiac work, myocardial oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and percentage of oxygen extraction were calculated.",

    "120": "A female infant suffered from epilepsy since the neonatal period, which evolved into West syndrome at the age of 2 months. Spasms in series and hypsarrhythmia disappeared after treatment with high-dose phenobarbital; however, single spasms persisted with right-sided predominance, and polyspike activity in the left parieto-temporal areas preceded or coincided with these spasms. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small calcification in the right occipital area, and positron emission tomography showed hypometabolism over the right hemisphere. Widespread epileptic discharges gradually increased on electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep thereafter. The patient presented with daytime unresponsiveness at 1 year and 6 months, when diffuse, irregular spike and wave activity characterized the waking EEG. Spasms or brief tonic seizures with right-sided predominance were provoked by auditory stimuli during this period, particularly by her mother's voice, with ictal EEG of right posterior predominant fast activity and subsequent desynchronization. The administration of clobazam resulted in the marked improvement of EEG findings and transient disappearance of spasms. Presumably, certain patients with asymmetrical epileptic spasms may be regarded as a unique type of localization-related epilepsy, and can show an unusual course of evolution in comparison to other cases of epilepsy that evolve after West syndrome.", 
    "121": "We tested the hypothesis that pre-operative forced-air warming is as effective for anxiolysis as intravenous midazolam, using a blinded, placebo controlled factorial design. One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned to cotton blanket and saline injection (n = 30), forced-air warmer and saline injection (n = 30), midazolam 30 microg x kg(-1) and cotton blanket (n = 30), and forced-air warmer and midazolam 30 microg x kg(-1) (n = 30). Patients completed visual analogue scales for anxiety and thermal comfort, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, at baseline and after 20 min. The estimated effect of midazolam on visual analogue scores for anxiety was -10 (95% CI -3 to -18; p = 0.007) and on state anxiety was -5 (95% CI -7 to -4; p = 0.03). Warming had no influence on visual analogue scores for anxiety (p = 0.50) or state anxiety (p = 0.33), but its estimated effect on thermal comfort was +23 (95% CI 19-27; p < 0.0001).

    "122": "Two 5HT(1A) receptor agonists and chlordiazepoxide were examined in open-field, elevated plus maze, and emergence tests. At doses with no effect in the open-field, chlordiazepoxide increased open and open/total arm visits as well as open arm duration in the elevated plus maze, whereas 5HT(1A) receptor agonists showed an anxiolytic response on a single measure. The anxiolytic action of chlordiazepoxide was limited to the less active BALB/c strain. Unlike the 5HT(1A) receptor agonists, chlordiazepoxide was also anxiolytic in the emergence test, once again only in BALB/c and not C57BL/6J mice. Significant correlations were found between emergence latencies and specific indicators of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze in chlordiazepoxide-treated but not in mice treated with buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT. These results indicate that elevated plus-maze and emergence tests depend on benzodiazepine receptors. In contrast, 5HT(1A) receptor agonists were ineffective in the emergence test and no correlation was found between emergence latencies and specific indicators of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. Though superficially similar, the emergence test seems to tap into a partially separate facet of anxiety.",

    "124": "The aim of our study was to investigate the etiological and demographical characteristics of acute adult poisoning cases admitted to a university hospital in Tabriz, Iran. This retrospective study was performed on 1342 poisoning admissions to a university hospital from 2003 to 2005, by data collection from the medical records of patients. Poisonings were 5.40% of the total admissions. There was a predominance of female patients (55.7%) compared to male patients (44.3%) with a female-to-male ratio of 1.2:1. Most poisonings occurred in the age range of 11-20 years (38.9%). Drugs were the most common cause of poisonings (60.8%). Among the drug poisonings, benzodiazepines (40.31%) were the most frequent agents, followed by antidepressants (31.98%). The seasonal distribution in poisoning patients suggested a peak in spring (28%) and summer (27.5%). In 9.8% of cases accidental and in 90.2% intentional poisonings were evident. Most suicide attempts were made by women (58.51%) and unmarried people (51.4%).The mean duration of hospitalization was 3.02 +/- 2.8 days. There were 28 (2.3%) deaths; the majority (13 cases) was due to pesticides. This was a university hospital-based study, so these results may not be representative of the general population. Despite this drawback, these data still provide important information on the characteristics of the poisoning in this part of Iran. To prevent such poisonings, the community education about the danger of central nervous system-acting drugs and reducing the exposure period of people to pesticides are recommended.", 
    "125": "Previous human studies have demonstrated that midazolam-induced signal changes on scalp EEG recording include widespread augmentation of sigma-oscillations and that the amplitude of such oscillations is correlated to the severity of midazolam-induced amnesia. Still unanswered questions include whether midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation also involves the medial temporal region, which plays a role in memory encoding. Taking advantage of rare and unique opportunities to monitor neuronal activities using intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) recording, we determined how intravenous administration of midazolam elicited spectral frequency changes in the human cerebral cortex, including the medial temporal region. We studied three children with focal epilepsy who underwent subdural electrode placement and extraoperative ECoG recording for subsequent resection of the seizure focus; an intravenous bolus of midazolam was given to abort an ongoing simple partial seizure or to provide sedation prior to induction of general anesthesia. 'Midazolam-induced ECoG frequency alteration' in sites distant from the seizure focus was sequentially animated on their individual three-dimensional MR images. The common ECoG changes induced by midazolam included gradual augmentation of sigma-oscillations (12-16 Hz) in the widespread non-epileptic regions, including the medial temporal region. The spatial and temporal alteration of ECoG spectral frequency pattern can be appreciated via animation movies. Midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation was observed in the medial temporal region in our relatively small cohort of human subjects. In-vivo animation of ECoG spectral measures provided a unique situation to study the effect of midazolam on neuronal processing in the deep brain regions.",

Catatonia should be considered as a differential diagnosis when the described symptoms occur in patients with a known organic cerebral disorder.", 
    "127": "The aim of the current national survey of all general practitioners (GPs) practising in Norway was to explore assessment, treatment practice and perceived efficacy of treatment of sleep problems in general practice. A short questionnaire, including self-report measures of the frequency and routines of treatment and assessment of sleep problems, was sent to all 4049 GPs in Norway, of whom 1465 (36.7%) provided valid responses. The prevalence of sleep problems among patients in general practice was estimated to be 11.2%, of which almost two-thirds were believed to be caused by a medical condition. Anamnestic information and blood tests were the most common assessment of sleep problems, whereas GPs rarely referred patients to all-night polysomnographic recording. Sleep hygiene advices were the most commonly used treatment strategy, whereas hypnotics were believed to have the best short-term efficacy. Antidepressives were considered to be the best option for long-term management of sleep problems. About one-third of the patients were prescribed benzodiazepines or 'Z-drugs' for more than 6 months. This study demonstrates that sleep problems are recognized by GPs, but despite evidence that non-pharmacological treatment is superior in the long-term management of insomnia, the current study shows that hypnotics are still considered by GPs to be the most successful treatment.",

The complex therapy of schizophrenia is a new method: the psychopharmacons together with psychotherapy (first of all with cognitive one), sociotherapy and psychiatric rehabilitation. During the acute or chronic phase of schizophrenia the psychopharmacons are the first line treatment, but the complex therapy is better. In the last forty years we tested this new therapy, finally conducted a clinical trial: with one psychopharmacon (monotherapy), with two or three psychopharmacons (combination) and with the complex therapy (one psychopharmacon together with psychotherapy, sociotherapy and psychiatric rehabilitation). The antipsychotics, first of all the second generations have a very good efficacy. Risperidone is proven to be an efficient product. Fields of indication: first psychotic episode, acut schizophrenic exacerbation, chronic schizophrenia, the treatment of behavior disorder in dementia, maniac phase of bipolar disorder, treatment of behavioral disorders.", 
    "129": "This study was undertaken to model the relationship between clonazepam plasma concentrations and a central nervous system adverse effect (impairment of the psychomotor performance) following the oral administration of immediate-release tablets of clonazepam in healthy volunteers. Such a (P)pharmacokinetic/(P)pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study is important to interpret properly the consequences of determined levels of plasma concentrations of psychoactive therapeutic drugs reported to be involved in road-traffic accidents. Twenty-three male subjects received a single oral dose of 4 mg clonazepam. Plasma concentration, determined by on-line solid phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and psychomotor performance, quantified through the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, were monitored for 72 hours. A 2-compartment open model with first order absorption and lag-time better fitted the plasma clonazepam concentrations. Clonazepam decreased the psychomotor performance by 72 +/- 3.7% (observed maximum effect), 1.5 to 4 hours (25th-75th percentile) after drug administration. A simultaneous population PK/PD model based on a sigmoid Emax model with time-dependent tolerance described well the time course of effect. Such acute tolerance could minimize the risk of accident as a result of impairment of motor skill after a single dose of clonazepam. However, an individual analysis of the data revealed a great interindividual variation in the relationship between clonazepam effect and plasma concentration, indicating that the phenomenon of acute tolerance can be predicted at a population, but not individual, level.", 
    "130": "The present study aimed to examine how video feedback can affect perceived performance and anticipatory anxiety in various naturalistic social anxiety-provoking situations among clinical patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to examine predictors that might influence response to video feedback. Participants were 52 consecutive patients with DSM-IV SAD who participated in a group-based CBT program. Our results demonstrated that video feedback was associated with a decrease in the underestimation of own performance as well as the perception of feared outcomes. Moreover, anticipatory anxiety decreased after video feedback combined with peer feedback. Male sex, comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, and benzodiazepine prn, as well as patients' initial anxiety and avoidance were negative predictors of the effect of video feedback.", 
    "131": "Metastasis as a complex process involves loss of adhesion, migration, invasion and proliferation of cancer cells. Sulforaphane (SFN) is one of naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive isothiocyanates found in cruciferous vegetables, consumption of which has been associated with reduced risk of cancer. In this study, we describe effect of SFN on various aspects determining invasive behavior of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. We studied modulation of molecules associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxic marker CA IX and mitochondrially located peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) using flow cytometry, gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP1, 3, 7, 9, 14, transcription factors POU5F1 and Twist1 mRNA by RT PCR, and cytokine production by multiplex bead assay. SFN downregulated PBR and vimentin expression in a dose dependent manner, but significantly affected neither HIF-1alpha, nor CA IX protein expression, nor VEGF and GLUT1 mRNA levels. Among studied MMPs, MMP7 and MMP14 mRNA were downregulated while no apparent effect on MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9 was observed. Further, we found significant down regulation of Twist1 and POU5F1, transcription factors that mediate EMT and the self-renewal of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. SFN reduced also the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, immunomodulating cytokine IL-4 and growth factors involved in angiogenesis PDGF and VEGF. Our study shows that SFN efficacy is associated with the reversal of several biological characteristics connected with EMT or implicated in the matrix degradation and extracellular proteolysis, as well as with reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic growth factors in MDA-MB-231 cells.", 
    "132": "The human cytochrome P450 3A4 mono-oxygenates approximately 50% of all drugs. Its substrates/products enter/leave the active site by access/exit channels. Here, we perform steered molecular dynamics simulations, pulling the products temazepam and testosterone-6betaOH out of the P450 3A4 enzyme in order to identify the preferred substrate/product pathways and their gating mechanism. We locate six different egress pathways of products from the active site with different exit preferences for the two products and find that there is more than just one access/exit channel in CYP3A4. The so-called solvent channel manifests the largest opening for both tested products, thereby identifying this channel as a putative substrate channel. Most channels consist of one or two pi-stacked phenylalanine residues that serve as gate keepers. The oxidized drug breaks the hydrophobic interactions of the gating residues and forms mainly hydrophobic contacts with the gate. We argue that product exit preferences in P450s are regulated by protein-substrate specificity.", 
    "133": "Since the emergence of social phobia into the diagnostic nomenclature, we have seen an exponential expansion in our knowledge regarding effective treatment of this disorder. The literature clearly supports the use of SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine ER as first line pharmacological agents in the treatment of GSAD. In this article, treatment studies of pharmacotherapy of social phobia are summarized. Additional issues such as comparative efficacy, treatment resistance and relapse-prevention are reviewed.", 
    "134": "Contextual cues linked to drug experience have been frequently associated to craving and relapse, with this phenomenon being described in human and experimental animals. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity has been related to learning, memory, and adaptive processes developed during chronic administration of drug abuse. In this study, we investigated if the environmental context associated with withdrawal experience was able to evoke the same behavioral alteration observed after chronic benzodiazepine administration. Furthermore, we studied the hippocampal synaptic plasticity and anatomical expression of Arc protein during withdrawal and the re-exposure to the context associated with anxiety expression (characteristic sign of benzodiazepines withdrawal). It was demonstrated that re-exposure evoked on days 15 and 25 after the first exposure the same behavior. An increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity, expressed as a lower threshold to induce long-term potentiation on dentate gyrus, was observed in animals dependent on diazepam and during retrieval, in the same group, until day 15. This plastic change disappeared 25 days after the first exposure. An overexpression of Arc protein in the dorsal dentate gyrus and CA1 on the first day of withdrawal in the dependent animals was observed.",

Bearing in mind the particularities of each brain hemisphere, our hypothesis was that measuring the relative power would allow us to investigate the effects of bromazepam on specific areas of the cortex. More specifically, we expected to observe different patterns of powers in sensory-motor integration, attention and activation processes.", 
    "136": "The sample was made up of 39 subjects (15 males and 24 females) with a mean age of 30 +/- 10 years. The control (placebo) and experimental (3 mg and 6 mg of bromazepam) groups were trained in the typing task with a randomised double-blind model.",

    "138": "The doses used in this study facilitated motor performance of the typing task. In this study, the use of the drug did not prevent learning of the task, but it did appear to concentrate mental effort on more restricted and specific aspects of typing. It also seemed to influence the rhythm and effectiveness of the operations performed during mechanisms related to the encoding and storage of new information. Likewise, a predominance of activity was observed in the left (dominant) frontal area in the 3 mg bromazepam group, which indicates that this dose of the drug affords the subject a greater degree of directionality of cortical activity for planning and performing the task.", 
    "139": "We examined the role of benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety by both psychiatrists and primary care physicians. Over the past year, 112.8 million prescriptions were filled for a benzodiazepine: 55 percent were prescribed by a primary care physician, 16 percent by a psychiatrist, and the remaining 29 percent of prescriptions by another type of specialty physician. Benzodiazepine monotherapy is much more common in the treatment of anxiety by primary care physicians (42%) than psychiatrists (22%). Even when both benzodiazepine monotherapy and combination regimens are considered, total benzodiazepine use remains slightly greater in primary care than psychiatry (51% vs. 42%).", 
    "140": "Data were collected prospectively on 100 consecutive invasive procedures, that is, lumbar and bone marrow punctures (alone or in combination), in 16 patients less than 21 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Efficacy of sedation and the need for restraint were graded according to 2 multiple-point scales. All invasive procedures were successfully performed. Oxygen by face mask was needed in 5 cases, whereas no patient required sedation reversal; 92% of the time, the patient was calm, cooperative, and responding to verbal commands, whereas in 97 procedures, there was no or only minimal patient movement that did not interfere with the completion of the procedure. Inpatient administration of midazolam and fentanyl by trained pediatric providers is safe and effective for invasive procedures in children and adolescents with ALL.", 
    "141": "Leptin is thought to reduce food intake, in part, by increasing sensitivity to satiation signals, including CCK. Leptin action in both forebrain and hindbrain reduces food intake, and forebrain leptin action augments both the anorexic and neuronal activation responses to CCK. Here, we asked whether leptin signaling in hindbrain also enhances these responses to CCK. We found that food intake was strongly inhibited at 30 min after a combination of 4th-intracerebroventricular (4th-icv) leptin injection and intraperitoneal CCK administration, whereas neither hormone affected intake during this period when given alone. Leptin injections targeted directly at the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) similarly enhanced the anorexic response to intraperitoneal CCK. Intra-DVC leptin injection also robustly increased the number of neurons positive for phospho-STAT3 staining in the area surrounding the site of injection, confirming local leptin receptor activation. Conversely, the anorexic response to 4th-icv leptin was completely blocked by IP devazepide, a CCKA-R antagonist, suggesting that hindbrain leptin reduces intake via a mechanism requiring endogenous CCK signaling. We then asked whether hindbrain leptin treatment enhances the dorsomedial hindbrain, hypothalamus, or amygdala c-Fos responses to IP CCK. We found that, in contrast to the effects of forebrain leptin administration, 4th-icv leptin injection had no effect on CCK-induced c-Fos in any structures examined. We conclude that leptin signaling in either forebrain or hindbrain areas can enhance the response to satiation signals and that multiple distinct neural circuits likely contribute to this interaction.", 
    "142": "Through iterative design cycles we have discovered a number of novel new classes where the imidazo[1,5-a][1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-d][1,4]benzodiazepine was deemed the most promising GABA(A) alpha5 inverse agonist class with potential for cognitive enhancement. This class combines a modest subtype binding selectivity with inverse agonism and has the most favourable molecular properties for further lead optimisation towards a central nervous system (CNS) acting medicine.", 
    "143": "Rhythmic movement disorder (RMD) refers to a group of stereotyped, repetitive movements involving large muscles, usually occurring prior to the onset of sleep and persisting into sleep. RMD more commonly exhibits only one or two forms of rhythmic movements (RM) in most reported cases. However, multiple RM forms of RMD occurring in a patient in the same night have rarely been reported. In this report, we present the unique case of a 15-year-old boy with RMD affected by multiple forms of RM in the same night, including four known forms (i.e., body rocking, head banging, leg rolling, and rhythmic feet movements) and two new kinds of RM (bilateral rhythmic arm rocking and rhythmic hands movements). Two video-polysomnographic recordings were performed in this patient before starting pharmacologic treatment and after long-term oral clonazepam treatment (1.0mg nightly for 3 months). The characteristics of RMD with multiple RM forms and the effectiveness of clonazepam on the RM episodes and polysomnographic findings observed in our patient are discussed. This report raises the fact that a patient with RMD may present with multiple complex rhythmic movements disrupting sleep, which emphasizes that better understanding of the clinical features of complex rhythmic movements during sleep in primary care settings is essential for early clinical diagnosis and optimal management.", 
    "144": "SJG-136 (1) is a sequence-selective DNA-interactive agent that is about to enter phase II clinical trials. Using a HPLC/MS-based methodology developed to evaluate the binding of DNA-interactive agents to oligonucleotides of varying length and sequence, we have demonstrated that, in addition to the previously known interstrand cross-link at Pu-GATC-Py sequences, 1 can form a longer interstrand cross-link at Pu-GAATC-Py sequences, an intrastrand cross-link at both shorter Pu-GATG-Py and longer Pu-GAATG-Py sequences, and, in addition, monoalkylated adducts at suitable PBD binding sites where neither intra- or interstrand cross-links are feasible because of the unavailability of two appropriately positioned guanines. Crucially, we have demonstrated a preference for the extended intrastrand cross-link with Pu-GAATG-Py, which forms more rapidly than the other cross-links (rank order: Pu-GAATG-Py > Pu-GATC-Py > Pu-GATG-Py and Pu-GAATC-Py). However, thermal denaturation studies suggest that the originally reported Pu-GATC-Py interstrand cross-link is more stable, consistent with the covalent joining of both strands of the duplex and a lower overall distortion of the helix according to modeling studies. These observations impact on the proposed mechanism of action of SJG-136 (1) both in vitro and in vivo, the repair of its adducts and mechanism of resistance in cells, and potentially on the type of pharmacodynamic assay used in clinical trials.",

    "149": "We investigated total prescription and new prescription trends before and after the economic slowdown beginning in September 2008. Over the July to November timeframe, both total prescriptions and new prescriptions for sleep aids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants increased. There appears to be a small spike in the number of total and new prescriptions following September 2008, although this increase was not enough to cause a statistically significant change in the overall rate of increase of prescriptions over time. Discussion of data is provided.", 
    "150": "The translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), also known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is directly or indirectly associated with many biological processes. Although extensively characterized, the specific function of TSPO during development remains unclear. It has been reported that TSPO is involved in a variety of mechanisms, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, regulation of mitochondrial functions, cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis, and porphyrin transport and heme synthesis. Although the literature has reported a murine knockout model, the experiment did not generate information because of early lethality. We then used the zebrafish model to address the function of tspo during development. Information about spatiotemporal expression showed that tspo has a maternal and a zygotic contribution which, during somatogenesis, seems to be erythroid restricted to the intermediate cell mass. Genetic and pharmacological approaches used to invalidate Tspo function resulted in embryos with specific erythropoietic cell depletion. Although unexpected, this lack of blood cells is independent of the Tspo cholesterol binding site and reveals a new in vivo key role for Tspo during erythropoiesis.", 
    "151": "Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness. Understanding the genetic variation affecting response to antipsychotics is important to develop novel diagnostic tests to match individual schizophrenia patients to the most effective and safe medication. In this study, we use a genome-wide approach to detect genetic variation underlying individual differences in response to treatment with the antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and perphenazine. Our sample consisted of 738 subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia who took part in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness. Subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500 K genotyping platform plus a custom 164 K chip to improve genome-wide coverage. Treatment outcome was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Our criterion for genome-wide significance was a prespecified threshold that ensures that, on an average, only 10% of the significant findings are false discoveries. The top statistical result reached significance at our prespecified threshold and involved a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an intergenic region on chromosome 4p15. In addition, SNPs in Ankyrin Repeat and Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-Containing Protein 1B (ANKS1B) and in the Contactin-Associated Protein-Like 5 gene (CNTNAP5), which mediated the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on Negative symptoms, were very close to our threshold for declaring significance. The most significant SNP in CNTNAP5 is nonsynonymous, giving rise to an amino-acid substitution. In addition to highlighting our top results, we provide all P-values for download as a resource for investigators with the requisite samples to carry out replication. This study demonstrates the potential of genome-wide association studies to discover novel genes that mediate the effects of antipsychotics, which could eventually help to tailor drug treatment to schizophrenic patients.", 
    "152": "This study describes the formulation of rapidly disintegrating, fast dissolving diazepam tablets intended for use in the oral cavity. The tablets were prepared by the conventional wet granulation method using solid dispersion of the drug with PEG-4000 and/or PEG-6000. A 3(2) factorial design was used to reduce the number of experimental runs and to obtain several formulations by which tablets disintegrated within 3 min and released 85% of the drug in less than 30 min. Several tablet formulations prepared with different amounts of PEGs in solid dispersion met the above two criteria. However, tablets which were prepared with PEG-4000 alone at the lowest concentration disintegrated in the shortest time (32.12 sec) and released 85% of the drug most rapidly (11.03 min).", 
    "153": "We studied the effects of antipsychotics and a hypnotic on sleep disturbance in schizophrenia using an animal model of the disease. Electrodes for the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) were chronically implanted into the cortex and the dorsal neck muscle of rats. EEG and EMG were recorded with an electroencephalograph for 6 h (10:00 - 16:00). SleepSign ver. 2.0 was used for EEG and EMG analysis. Haloperidol and olanzapine had an antagonizing effect on the increases in sleep latency and total awake time and the decrease in total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time induced by MK-801. Olanzapine also antagonized the decrease in total rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time induced by MK-801. Aripiprazole antagonized only the increase in sleep latency induced by MK-801, whereas, risperidone, quetiapine, and flunitrazepam had no effect in the changes of sleep-wake pattern induced by MK-801. Olanzapine increased delta activity and decreased beta activity during NREM sleep. In contrast, flunitrazepam had an opposite effect. It was clarified that haloperidol and olanzapine were effective for decrease of sleep time in this animal model of schizophrenia. In addition, aripiprazole showed a sleep-inducing effect in schizophrenia model rat. On the other hand, flunitrazepam showed no beneficial effect on sleep disturbance in schizophrenia model rat."
