    "1": "Extrapyramidal symptom data were analyzed for 1796 patients treated with olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day) and 810 patients treated with haloperidol (5 to 20 mg/day) for up to 6 weeks of therapy. Patients were monitored weekly by three methods of extrapyramidal symptom assessment: (1) detection of extrapyramidal adverse events (signs and symptoms) by casual observation, nonprobing inquiry, and spontaneous report; (2) objective rating scale scores: and (3) use of concomitant anticholinergic medications. Emergence of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of the incidence of extrapyramidal syndrome categories based on adverse events, (2) the incidence of extrapyramidal syndromes based on categorical analysis of rating scale scores, (3) analysis of mean maximum change in rating scale scores, and (4) categorical analysis of anticholinergic medication use. Outcome of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of mean change in rating scale scores at endpoint and (2) mean anticholinergic use at endpoint.", 
    "2": "Olanzapine was statistically significantly (p = .014, p < .001) superior to haloperidol in all four analyses related to emergence of EPS and in the two analyses related to outcome. Furthermore, during acute treatment, statistically significantly fewer patients treated with olanzapine (0.3%) discontinued the study because of any extrapyramidal adverse event than patients treated with haloperidol (2.7%, p < .001).", 
    "3": "Olanzapine exhibited a statistically significantly lower extrapyramidal symptom profile than the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol at comparably effective antipsychotic doses. The lower extrapyramidal symptom profile with olanzapine was evident despite statistically significantly more frequent use of anticholinergic drugs among haloperidol-treated patients. Fewer olanzapine-treated than haloperidol-treated patients discontinued because of EPS, suggesting that olanzapine should contribute to better compliance with longer term maintenance treatment, with minimal anticholinergic-associated events.", 
    "4": "We evaluated the efficacy of local perfusion of diazepam (DZP) in suppression of EEG spikes and behavioral seizures produced by bicuculline methiodide (BMI) applied to rat sensory motor cortex and hippocampus.", 
    "5": "Data were obtained from 37 rats implanted with EEG head plugs and perfusion cannulas. BMI 4 mM, 5 microliters was infused on neocortex through the epidural space in 23 rats. BMI 0.1 mM, 2 microliters was infused into the left hippocampus in 14 rats.", 
    "6": "DZP 0.75-1.0 mg markedly reduced the spiking to a level of 9.9 +/- 15.8% of baseline for DZP as compared with 90.2 +/- 57.9% of baseline for vehicle-treated rats. DZP reduced spiking in a hippocampal BMI focus to 1.9 +/- 2.4% of baseline spiking, as compared with 98.0 +/- 95.6% of that in vehicle-treated animals. The amount of spread of solution was estimated with methylene blue (MB) injections. Ictal events also were attenuated. In most of the animals, systemic levels of DZP were unmeasurable and injection on the contralateral side did not reduce spiking.", 
    "7": "These findings suggest that focal application of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in brain may be a useful new avenue for therapy of intractable partial seizures.", 
    "8": "The role of four muscarinic receptor subtypes M1, M2, M3 and M4 which have been characterized pharmacologically was examined in motility control of isolated rat gastric fundus. Acetylcholine produced concentration-dependent tonic contraction of isolated rat fundus (EC50 = 9.64 +/- 0.14 x 10(-8)M). These contractions were concentration-dependently antagonized by atropine (KB = 2.45 x 10(-11)M), M1 selective blockers telenzepine (KB = 6.64 x 10(-11)M) and pirenzepine (KB = 2.3 x 10(-8)M), and hexocyclium (KB = 2.82 x 10(-10)M). M3-selective blocker p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pFHHSiD) was a less potent antagonist (KB = 2.3 x 10(-8)M), while M2 and M4-selective methoctramine produced only weak blockade of tonic contractions caused by acetylcholine (KB = 4.68 x 10(-6)M). These results suggest that only M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors have functional roles in motility control of rat gastric fundus, M1 receptors being more important.", 
    "9": "Previous reports have suggested that the effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil diminish over repeated exposure in subjects treated chronically with a benzodiazepine agonist. The current study examined whether the frequency of exposure to flumazenil altered its potency in decreasing rates of responding in monkeys treated with chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Three monkeys responded under a multiple fixed ratio (FR10:FR10) schedule of food presentation and stimulus-shock termination (SST). In untreated monkeys, flumazenil (0.1-3.2 mg/kg) had no effect in either component. After 2 weeks of treatment with 32.0 mg/kg per day of CDP, flumazenil decreased response rates in the food component, with a dose of 3.2 mg/kg decreasing rates to 10% of control; rates in the SST component were not altered by flumazenil. When flumazenil dose-effect curves were redetermined at 28-, 14-, 7-, 4-, 2- or 1-day intervals, there was no further change in the potency of flumazenil in decreasing food-maintained responding. When CDP treatment was terminated, the potency of flumazenil recovered to pre-CDP values within 23 days. These results suggest that dependence develops to CDP, since changes in the potency of flumazenil co-varied with CDP treatment. Moreover, it does not appear as though results from previous reports, that showed a diminished response to frequently-administered flumazenil, can be generalized to all conditions.", 
    "10": "The effect of long-term treatment (three times daily for 3 weeks) with a behaviorally relevant dose of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist imidazenil (0.5 mg/kg, IP) on basal dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats was compared with that of diazepam (3 mg/kg, IP), a benzodiazepine receptor full agonist. Challenge doses of imidazenil and diazepam decreased the extracellular dopamine concentration in the nucleus accumbens by approximately the same extent in animals repeatedly exposed to vehicle or to the respective drug. Moreover, the abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment with diazepam or imidazenil failed to affect basal dopamine release in this brain area during the first 5 days of withdrawal. In contrast, administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (4 mg/kg, IP) elicited a marked increase (95 or 60%) in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens 6 h after withdrawal of diazepam or imidazenil, respectively. Flumazenil induced a similar but smaller effect (50% increase) 5 days after diazepam withdrawal but had no effect 5 days after discontinuation of imidazenil treatment. The results support an involvement of the mesoaccumbens dopaminergic neurons in the withdrawal syndrome precipitated by flumazenil and allow further differentiation of benzodiazepine receptor partial and full agonists with respect to dependence liability of dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens.", 
    "11": "The present study compared the acute subject-rated and performance-impairing effects of trazodone and triazolam in seven healthy humans. Trazodone (50, 100 and 200 mg), triazolam (0.125, 0.25, 0.50 mg) and placebo were administered orally in a double-blind, crossover design. Drug effects were measured approximately 30 min before drug administration and repeatedly afterwards for 6 h. Trazodone and triazolam produced dose-related increases in subject-ratings of drug effect and sedation. The absolute magnitude of trazodone's and triazolam's effects was comparable across these measures, which suggests the doses tested were equivalent on some behavioral dimension. By contrast, triazolam, but not trazodone, increased subject ratings of \"dizzy\", \"excited\", \"nervous\", \"restless\", \"stomach turning\" and \"itchy skin\". Triazolam, but not trazodone, significantly impaired learning, recall and performance. The present findings suggest trazodone may be a viable alternative to benzodiazepine hypnotics like triazolam, especially when needing to minimize drug-induced impairment. Future research could extend the present findings by replicating them in a clinically relevant population such as individuals with histories of drug abuse.", 
    "12": "The occurrence of motor impairment after intrathecal drug administration is infrequently reported in the literature and the methods of determining motor function vary.", 
    "13": "Motor function was examined in rabbits after a wide dose range of a variety of intrathecally administered opioid agonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists, non-competitive NMDA antagonists, a benzodiazepine agonist, a sigma agonist, paracetamol, isotonic and acidified saline. The opioids, sigma agonist and NMDA antagonists were additionally examined following pretreatment with naloxone. The opioid antagonists naltrindole and MR2266 (delta- and kappa-opioid receptor antagonists, respectively) were administered before the delta agonist and the kappa agonist. The alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine was given before administration of dexmedetomidine and xylazine. Motor function was evaluated by a five-point scale of motor impairment ranging from normal function to total paralysis of the hindlegs.", 
    "14": "DPDPE (delta agonist), paracetamol, naloxone, naltrindole, yohimbine, isotonic and acidified saline did not affect motor function. MR2266 produced minor motor impairment. The alpha-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine reduced motor function slightly and dose independently. The remaining compounds affected motor function in a dose-dependent fashion. High doses of morphine produced hypersensitivity and myoclonus. An irreversible paralysis of the hindlegs was observed following intrathecal administration of the sigma agonist SKF10047 in high doses. Naloxone and MR2266 attenuated the effects of U50488H (kappa agonist).", 
    "15": "The present results reveal a dose-dependent reduction in motor function after intrathecal administration of some of the investigated compounds. The mechanisms behind these effects appear to be multifactorial.", 
    "16": "Rohypnol, a potent sedative-hypnotic drug prescribed extensively throughout the world, is illicit in the United States. Recently, this drug has gained popularity among United States youths as a cheap means of intoxication and subsequently has become the focus of numerous criminal investigations. College men are alleged to slip Rohypnol tablets into unsuspecting women's drinks and then sexually abuse their sedated victims. Although law enforcement agencies and drug policy groups consider Rohypnol to be an \"imminent problem,\" little is actually known about patterns of misuse. Presented here is a brief overview of Rohypnol's contemporary appearance in the United States.", 
    "17": "Benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonists are prototypic anxiolytic agents, whereas BZR inverse agonists exert anxiogenic effects. The effects of these compounds offer a potentially important pharmacological model system to examine the central mechanisms of anxiety. In accord with its putative anxiogenic properties, we previously found that the BZR partial inverse agonist, FG 7142, enhances the cardiovascular defensive response to a nonsignal acoustic stimulus in rats. In contrast, we found in the present study that this agent attenuates both the somatic and cardiovascular components of the acoustic startle response. BZR agonists and inverse agonists are known to modulate the basal forebrain cortical cholinergic system, and we consider the potential involvement of this system in the disparate psychophysiological actions of FG 7142 and in anxiety states in general.", 
    "18": "In a prospective, double-blind, controlled study the efficacy of clonidine was assessed in children, with respect to sedation, intubation response, and recovery. Fifty children, aged 4-12 years, undergoing general anesthesia were studied. Twenty-five children (group I) received oral diazepam) 0.2 mg/kg and another 25 children (group II) received oral clonidine 3 micrograms/kg, 90-120 minutes before induction of anesthesia. The level of sedation, hemodynamic changes to laryngoscopy and intubation, the recovery from anesthesia were noted and compared between the groups. Clonidine 3 micrograms/kg produced sedation comparable to diazepam 0.2 mg/kg (p > 0.1). There was significant (p > 0.01) attenuation of hemodynamic intubation response with clonidine. The recovery with clonidine was not delayed (p < 0.01). Clinically significant hypotension and bradycardia were not observed in any of the patients. We conclude that clonidine 3 micrograms/kg produces sedation comparable to diazepam 0.2 mg/kg and also attenuates the intubation response without increasing the incidence of complications.", 
    "19": "Alprazolam is one of the most widely prescribed benzodiazepines in the United States. It is generally considered a safe and effective drug for the treatment of anxiety disorders and panic attacks. Few overdoses that are due to the sole ingestion of alprazolam have been reported. This paper documents a fatality due to alprazolam intoxication and describes the distribution of alprazolam and an active metabolite, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, in tissues obtained at autopsy. Qualitative identification of the drugs was achieved by full-scan gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and quantitative analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. High concentrations of alprazolam were found in all specimens analyzed, but the metabolite was detected only in subclavian blood, urine, bile, and liver. A postmortem heart blood alprazolam concentration of 2.1 mg/L is the highest reported in the literature to date.", 
    "20": "We used quantitative autoradiography of [3H]CNQX (200 nM), [3H]muscimol (13 nM), and [3H]flunitrazepam (10 nM) binding to study the distribution of non-NMDA and GABA(A) receptors in the cerebellum of pcd mutant mice with unilateral cerebellar grafts. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubation with 1 mM Glu, 200 microM GABA, or 1 microM clonazepam, respectively. Saturation parameters were defined in wild-type and mutant cerebella. In mutants, non-NMDA receptors were reduced by 38% in the molecular layer and by 47% in the granule cell layer. The reduction of non-NMDA receptors in the pcd cerebellar cortex supports their localization on Purkinje cells. [3H]CNQX binding sites were visualized at higher density in grafts that had migrated to the cerebellar cortex of the hosts (4.1 and 11.0 pmol/mg protein, respectively, at 23 and 37 days after grafting) than in grafts arrested intraparenchymally (2.6 and 6.2 pmol/mg protein, respectively, at 23 and 37 days after grafting). The pattern of expression of non-NMDA receptors in cortical vs. parenchymal grafts suggests a possible regulation of their levels by transacting elements from host parallel fibers. GABA(A) binding levels in the grafts for both ligands used were similar to normal molecular layer. Binding was increased in the deep cerebellar nuclei of pcd mutants: the increase in [3H]muscimol binding over normal was 215% and the increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding was 89%. Such increases in the pcd deep cerebellar nuclei may reflect a denervation-induced supersensitivity subsequent to the loss of Purkinje axon terminal innervation. In the deep nuclei of pcd mutants with unilateral cerebellar grafts, [3H]muscimol binding was 31% lower in the grafted side than in the contralateral nongrafted side at 37 days after transplantation; [3H]flunitrazepam binding was also lower in the grafted side by 15% compared to the nongrafted side. Such changes in GABA(A) receptors suggest a significant, albeit partial, normalizing trend of cerebellar grafts on the state of postsynaptic supersensitive receptors in the host cerebellar nuclei.", 
    "21": "Most of the future advances in therapy with behavioral medicine probably will be pharmacologic. Newer developments in tricyclic antidepressants, specific and nonspecific anxiolytics, narcotic agonist-antagonists, and benzodiazepines will have great relevance for veterinary medicine. As the field of behavioral medicine expands, its paradigm hopefully will enlarge to include combination therapy and the implementation of neuropharmacologic intervention as a diagnostic tool. At present, the veterinary practitioner can effectively aid many common behavioral problems, with the glaring exception of most aggressions, using extant drugs.", 
    "22": "A 43 year old woman had suffered from insomnia for the past 11 years and was being treated with benzodiazepines. All attempts to stop benzodiazepine treatment resulted in withdrawal symptoms and a renewal of the insomnia. Treatment with 1 mg of controlled release melatonin enabled the patient to completely cease any benzodiazepine use within two days, with an improvement in sleep quality and no side effects. Examination of urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin levels before the melatonin treatment indicated that the levels were very low and lacked the typical circadian rhythm of excretion. Reexamination of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin levels during melatonin treatment revealed the existence of a normal circadian rhythm of excretion. This case may suggest that some of the people suffering from insomnia and addicted to benzodiazepines may successfully undergo withdrawal from these drugs and improve their sleep by means of treatment with melatonin. The results of this single case study warrant further investigation of a larger population by means of a double-blind placebo-drug study.", 
    "23": "A 6-week acute phase of an international 1-year double-blind study was conducted comparing three dose ranges of olanzapine (5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, and 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day) with a fixed dose of olanzapine (1.0 mg/day) and with a dose range of haloperidol (15 +/- 5 mg/day) in the treatment of 431 patients with schizophrenia. The purpose was to determine whether olanzapine demonstrated a dose-related ability to decrease overall psychopathology with minimal associated extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The high-dose olanzapine group showed statistically significantly greater improvement in overall psychopathology based on mean change in the CGI Severity score and statistically significantly greater improvement in positive psychotic symptoms based on mean change in both the BPRS positive score and the PANSS positive score compared with the 1.0-mg/day olanzapine group. Analyses indicated that an increasing dose-response curve was observed across the range of all olanzapine dose groups. Acute extrapyramidal syndromes were reported less frequently among all olanzapine groups compared with the haloperidol group. Endpoint mean change on both the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale reflected improvement for all olanzapine treatment groups compared with worsening for the haloperidol group. Olanzapine was associated with weight gain but did not appear to have any clinically meaningful effect on vital signs. Although olanzapine was associated with some increase in prolactin concentrations, increases were transient, occurred less often, and were of lesser magnitude than those observed with haloperidol.", 
    "24": "The effect of oral premedication was investigated in a double-blind, randomised trial in 85 children undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Orally administered midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 given 30 min pre-operatively was compared with trimeprazine 2 mg.kg-1 given 90 min pre-operatively and a placebo preparation. Compliance, sedation and ease of induction were assessed as were the duration and quality of recovery. Following premedication with midazolam none of the patients was anxious, crying or distressed on leaving the ward, compared with 2/28 in the trimeprazine group and 5/28 in the placebo group (p = 0.0007). More patients were calm and quiet on arrival in the anaesthetic room following midazolam than following trimeprazine, with both premedicant agents comparing favourably with placebo. There was no significant difference between the three groups in the time to recovery or the sedation score on discharge to the ward. Midazolam is a safe and effective oral premedicant for children.", 
    "25": "Several factors may affect the validity and outcome of urine testing for abused drugs such as amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, ethanol, opiates, and phencyclidine. Urine is used for large-scale testing because acquisition of the sample is noninvasive and because most abused drugs can be detected in urine for a reasonable duration after ingestion. Urine testing for drugs of abuse is a two-step process. In the first step, screening assays are used to identify presumably positive specimens. Common screening tests are radioimmunoassays, enzyme immunoassays, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, and thin layer chromatography. Since they may be subject to cross-reactivity, once a possible positive sample has been identified by a preliminary test, a second more specific methodology, gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, is done to confirm the results. Knowledge of the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of abused drugs affects selection and interpretation of test results.", 
    "26": "Over the past decade, many pediatric endoscopists have replaced general anesthesia with conscious sedation. Sedation is commonly used to minimize discomfort.", 
    "27": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of conscious sedation we reviewed 2711 reports of lower and upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations performed in 2026 patients between July 1981 and December 1992.", 
    "28": "Intravenous sedation was accomplished using meperidine and diazepam (914 examinations, 35%) or meperidine and midazolam (1427 examinations, 55%). Single agents were used for 83 examinations (3%), and 96 examinations (3.5%) were performed with the patient under general anesthesia. In the lower endoscopy group sedated intravenously (n = 713), the cecum was reached in 82% of examinations. The procedure could not be completed in 17 cases in which patients were uncooperative despite sedation. In the upper endoscopy group sedated intravenously (N = 1653), all but 91 endoscopies were completed to the descending duodenum. Esophagoscopy had been planned in 76% of these procedures. Minor complications occurred in 7 patients (0.3%). This included two episodes of significant oxygen desaturation that responded to oxygen administration and narcotic reversal. A major complication occurred in 1 patient (0.04%) who had a gastric perforation during esophageal dilation over a defective guide wire. There were no deaths, episodes of cardiorespiratory arrest, or pulmonary aspirations in our series. The combined major and minor complication rate was 0.3%.", 
    "29": "Intravenous conscious sedation is safe and effective in children undergoing endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected patients will require general anesthesia.", 
    "30": "Behavioral manifestations, electroencephalograms (EEGs) and visually evoked potentials (VEPs) were studied in beagles with Eck's fistula (portacaval shunt [PCS]), an established model of hyperammonemia, to determine whether they developed CNS disorders characteristic of hepatic encephalopathy. After PCS, behavioral changes occurred in the form of listlessness, sluggishness (altered gait, snapping and transient catatonia-like symptoms) and apparent blindness, which appeared in that order and progressed to coma and death in some animals. The EEGs from the frontal cortex showed a gradual decrease in voltage and frequency. Development of snapping and catatonia-like symptoms coincided with the occurrence of high voltage fast waves in the EEGs from the occipital cortex. In comatose Eck's fistula dogs. flattening of the EEGs was recorded from the frontal cortex and a lowered voltage was noted in the EEGs from the occipital cortex. After PCS, the latencies and amplitudes of the components of VEP were increased. The snapping and catatonia-like symptoms were markedly ameliorated by carbamazepine and the coma by flumazenil and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. These findings indicate that Eck's fistula dogs provide a useful model of hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "31": "The effects of majonoside-R2 on antinociceptive responses caused by the mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine and the selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist U-50, 488H were examined by the tail-pinch test in mice. Intraperitoneal (IP) or intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of majonoside-R2 (3.1-6.2 mg/kg, IP or 5-10 micrograms/mouse, ICV) and diazepam (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, IP or 0.5-1.0 microgram/mouse, ICV), as well as an opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (2 mg/kg, IP or 5 micrograms/mouse, ICV), dose-dependently attenuated the antinociception caused by subcutaneously administered morphine and U-50,488H. Moreover, when co-administered ICV or intrathecally (IT) with morphine (4 micrograms/mouse) or U-50,488H (60 micrograms/mouse), majonoside-R2 (5-20 micrograms/mouse) also exhibited antagonism against the antinociceptive action of these opioid receptor agonists in the tail-pinch test. The inhibitory effects of majonoside-R2 (10 micrograms/mouse, ICV) and diazepam (1 microgram/mouse, ICV) were reversed by flumazenil (2.5 micrograms/mouse, ICV), a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and picrotoxin (0.25 microgram/mouse, ICV), a GABA-gated chloride channel blocker. These results suggest that majonoside-R2 attenuates the opioid-induced antinociception by acting at the spinal and supraspinal levels, and that the GABAA receptor complex at the supraspinal level is involved in the effect of ICV administered majonoside-R2.", 
    "32": "Rats traversing a straight-alley for reinforcing stimuli typically exhibit faster running times as training proceeds. In previous work from this laboratory, animals running for a reinforcement consisting of intravenous infusions of cocaine, unexpectedly demonstrated a progressive increased time to enter the goalbox over trials. Closer observation revealed that the animals were exhibiting a unique retreat behavior (i.e., stopping their forward advance toward the goalbox and returning toward the startbox). It was hypothesized that the retreat behavior reflected an inherent conflict that originated from concurrent positive and negative associations with the goalbox. Such associations were attributed to cocaine's dual and well documented reinforcing and anxiogenic effects. To test this idea, the present study compared the runway behavior of animals that concurrently received food and mild foot shock in the goalbox to the behavior of the other animals running for cocaine. Results demonstrated that food + shock reinforced animals took longer to enter the goalbox and made more retreats than a control group that received only food in the goalbox. Both these effects were reversed by pretreatment with the anticonflict, anxiolytic drug, diazepam. The behavior pattern of animals that received the combination of food and footshock was found to strongly resemble that of IV cocaine-reinforced rats, a result consistent with the notion that chronic cocaine administration has both positive and negative consequences.", 
    "33": "In view of apparent commonalities in the aetiology, symptomatology, and pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depressive disorders, the present study compares the effects of the benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (1.0-8.0 mg/kg), the selective noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor, maprotiline (0.5-10.0 mg/kg), and the serotonin (5-HT)-selective reuptake inhibitor, fluvoxamine (2.0-8.0 mg/kg), on the behaviour of mice in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. To more accurately reflect the clinical situation, subjects were treated daily for 21 days prior to testing, and comprehensive behavioural profiles were obtained through the application of an ethological scoring technique. Results show that subchronic treatment with chlordiazepoxide produced clear anxiolytic-like effects at the highest dose tested, coupled with an inhibition of risk assessment over the entire dose range. With the exception of risk assessment measures, anxiolytic-like effects were also seen with a low dose (0.5 mg/kg) of maprotiline: these effects were lost at higher doses. In contrast to these data, fluvoxamine produced minimal behavioural change under present test conditions. Findings are discussed in relation to the relative efficacy of selective monoamine. reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and the nature of anxiety evoked in mice by exposure to the elevated plus-maze.", 
    "34": "The present study compares the effects of subchronic administration (daily. 21 days) of chlordiazepoxide (CD), maprotiline and fluvoxamine on the behavior of male mice during dyadic social interactions. Maprotiline like chlordiazepoxide, stimulated aggression at 4 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg respectively (intermediate dose levels), whereas effects of fluvoxamine (3-8 mg/kg) were mainly sedative. Non-social activity was reduced by CD at 4 and 8 mg/kg and by maprotiline at 0.5 mg/kg. At the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg), maprotiline increased immobility, resembling the effects of fluvoxamine, while at 2 mg/kg, it reduced social investigation. Thus, despite some commonalities, there were several differences in behavioral profile of the compounds tested. Data are discussed in relation to the efficacy of each of these compounds in treating anxiety and depressive disorders.", 
    "35": "Mice injected with either 8, 16 or 32 mg/kg of pentobarbital were as efficient as control subjects in learning and recalling the location of a submerged platform in a water maze. The highest dose of pentobarbital decreased fall latencies in the coat-hanger test of motor coordination. Exploratory activity was not affected by these doses of pentobarbital. The absence of a deficit in spatial learning and in exploratory activity occurred even at a dose sufficient to cause a deficit in motor coordination. These results stand in contrast to previous findings indicating spatial deficits in rats injected with benzodiazepines.", 
    "36": "Tolerance and sensitization to the behavioral effects of cocaine were investigated in rats responding under a fixed-consecutive-number eight schedule of food reinforcement. The development of tolerance or sensitization was induced by delivering the drug either immediately before or after each behavioral session during chronic administration. Chronic cocaine administered before each session resulted in tolerance, as indicated by the shift to the right in the cocaine dose response curve. This tolerance was more likely to develop in the presence of an external discriminative stimulus. On the other hand, when cocaine was delivered after each session, the injections did not disrupt responding and sensitization or increased sensitivity rather than tolerance developed. This sensitization was more likely to occur when the external discriminative stimulus was not present. These data suggest that either tolerance or sensitization to the behavioral effects of cocaine can occur following the same number of chronic injections, with the effect dependent on the context under which the drug is delivered. Significant differences in benzodiazepine receptor binding measured autoradiographically using [3H]flumazenil were observed between rats that received cocaine before or after each session, suggesting that the development of tolerance and sensitization may be mediated through changes in benzodiazepine receptors in discrete brain regions.", 
    "37": "The ability of the selective cholecystokinin(B) (CCK(B)) receptor antagonist L-365,260 (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) to modulate the antinociceptive action of relatively low doses of systemic morphine (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) was evaluated using a well established rat model of peripheral unilateral mononeuropathy. Behavioural tests based on both mechanical (vocalization threshold to paw pressure) and thermal (struggle latency after immersion of the paw into a cold (10 degrees C), warm (44 degrees C) or hot (46 degrees C) water bath) stimuli were used. Experiments were performed 2 weeks after the surgery when the pain-related behaviour has fully developed. We demonstrated a differential effect of L-365,260 depending both on the dose of morphine and the test used. Pretreatment with the CCK(B) receptor antagonist (0.2 mg/kg) inverted the ineffectiveness of the lowest dose (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) of morphine against the noxious (46 degrees C) thermal stimulus, and the effect of the combination was equal to that seen after the dose 0.3 mg/kg of morphine alone. Likewise, in the mechanical test, the already enhanced effect of this dose (0.1 mg/kg) of morphine on the nerve-injured paw was further increased (by 4-fold) after L-365,260 pretreatment. These effects were abolished by naloxone (0.01 mg/kg i.v.). However, the effects of the higher doses (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) of morphine against the mechanical or noxious thermal stimuli were not significantly enhanced by pretreatment with the CCK(B) receptor antagonist. Further, L-365,260 was found to be completely ineffective in modulating the responses to morphine at 10 degrees C and at 44 degrees C.", 
    "38": "In a modified Geller-Seifter conflict procedure, rats were trained to lever-press for food under a multiple variable interval-fixed ratio (VI30: food; FR10: food + shock) schedule of reinforcement. The ability to antagonize response suppression in the punished period is considered a good predictor for anxiolytic activity. Chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam increased punished responding. The 5-HT1A receptor agonists flesinoxan (R(+)-N-[2[4-(2,3-dihydro-2-2-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzodioxin-5-yl)- 1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-4-fluorobenzoamide; 0.1-10.0 mg/kg) and 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin; 0.03-0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased punished responding, supporting a role of the 5-HT1A receptor in anxiety. 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan also reduced unpunished responding. The anxiolytic effects of 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan could only be antagonized with a high dose (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg respectively) of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride). All doses of WAY-100635 antagonized the 5-HT1A-induced effects on unpunished responding. The dissimilarity in dose-response curve of WAY-100635 on punished and unpunished behaviour poses questions about the mediation of these effects.",

Effects of muscimol, ethanol, flunitrazepam, and pentobarbital on receptor function were compared for the two expression systems using a 36Cl- flux assay for cells and an electrophysiological assay for oocytes. Muscimol activated all receptors in both expression systems but was more potent for L(tk-) cells than oocytes; this difference ranged from 2.6-to 26-fold, depending upon subunit composition. The most pronounced differences between receptors and expression systems were found for ethanol. In L(tk-) cells, low (5-50 mM) concentrations of ethanol potentiated muscimol responses only with receptors containing the gamma 2L subunit. In oocytes, concentrations of 30-100 mM produced small enhancements for most subunit combinations. Flunitrazepam enhanced muscimol responses for all receptors except alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2S and alpha 1 beta 1, and this enhancement was similar for both expression systems. Pentobarbital also enhanced muscimol responses for all receptors, and this enhancement was similar for L(tk-) cells and oocytes, except for alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2S where the pentobarbital enhancement was much greater in oocytes than cells. The alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2S receptors were also distinct in that pentobarbital produced direct activation of chloride channels in both expression systems. Thus, the type of expression/assay system markedly affects the actions of ethanol on GABAA receptors and also influences the actions of muscimol and pentobarbital on this receptor. Differences between these expression systems may reflect posttranslational modifications of receptor subunits.", 
    "46": "A number of treatment options are currently available for the medical management of epilepsy. Conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) include phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, ethosuximide, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Although these drugs control seizures, they may also cause blood dyscrasias, sedation, and cognitive impairment. Felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin are new AEDs believed to cause fewer side effects than conventional medications. Felbamate, however, has been linked with substantially increased incidence of aplastic anemia, and the other new AEDs have been studied for relatively short periods of time. Ketogenic diets, comprised of foods high in fat and low in protein and carbohydrate content, have been reported to improve seizure control. However, these diets are widely acknowledged to be unpalatable, making sustained compliance with dietary restrictions difficult. To promote long-term control of seizures, physicians must consider the side effects of therapeutic interventions for epilepsy, as well as their anticonvulsant efficacy.", 
    "47": "A severe rest tremor arose in a patient's right arm 9 months after a pontine tegmental hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance studies at 4 and 10 months showed residual hemosiderin in the pons and increasing hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) affecting primarily the left olive. The tremor was refractory to pharmacotherapy (clonazepam, propranolol, and levodopa), but was reduced after implantation of a thalamic stimulator device. Although pontine hemorrhage is among several common causes of HOD, it has not previously been appreciated as a cause of midbrain (\"rubral\") tremor. A disynaptic dentatorubroolivary tract associated with tremor and monosynaptic dentatoolivary tract associated with HOD may both be components of the rubroolivocerebellorubral loop implicated in midbrain tremor. Their proximity makes the combination of tremor and HOD after pontine tegmental damage plausible and even likely.", 
    "48": "This study aimed to quantify the efficiency and smoothness of voluntary movement in Huntington's disease (HD) by the use of a graphics tablet that permits analysis of movements profiles. In particular, we aimed to ascertain whether a concurrent task (digit span) would affect the kinematics of goal-directed movements. Twelve patients with HD and their matched controls performed 12 vertical zig-zag movements, with both left and right hands (with and without the concurrent task), to large or small circular targets over long or short extents. The concurrent task was associated with shorter movement times and reduced right-hand superiority. Patients with HD were overall slower, especially, with long strokes, and had similar peak velocities for both small and large targets, so that controls could better accommodate differences in target size. Patients with HD spent more time decelerating, especially with small targets, whereas controls allocated more nearly equal proportions of time to the acceleration and deceleration phases of movement, especially with large targets. Short strokes were generally less force inefficient than were long strokes, especially so for either hand in either group in the absence of the concurrent task, and for the right hand is its presence. With the concurrent task, however, the left hand's behavior changed differentially for the two groups; for patients with HD, it became more force efficient with short strokes and even less efficient with long strokes, whereas for controls, it became more efficient with long strokes. Controls may be able to divert attention away from the inferior left hand, increasing its automaticity, whereas patients with HD, because of disease, may be forced to engage even further online visual control under the demands of a concurrent task. Patients with HD may perhaps become increasingly reliant on terminal visual guidance, which indicates an impairment in constructing and refining an internal representation of the movement necessary for its effective execution. Basal ganglia dysfunction may impair the ability to use internally generated cues to guide movement.", 
    "49": "Previously it was reported that some patients with tremor had the same electrophysiological findings as those seen in patients with cortical reflex myoclonus, and consequently the tremor was named \"cortical tremor.\" In the present study, we examined six patients from three families with cortical tremor of relatively late onset. The inheritance pattern of cortical tremor was compatible with autosomal dominant trait. Those patients had relatively rhythmic involuntary movements (tremor) in the distal upper and lower limbs, especially during posture and/or fine movements. There was no cerebellar ataxia or dementia, and fits of loss of consciousness occurred only infrequently. Electrophysiologically, they had generalized spikes on electroencephalogram (EEG), giant cortical components of somatosensory evoked potential, an enhanced long-loop reflex (C-reflex), and cortical spikes preceding the rhythmic jerk demonstrable by the jerk-locked back averaging method, thus fulfilling the criteria of cortical reflex myoclonus. Furthermore, they had slow negative EEG shift starting 1-2 s prior to voluntary movements, suggesting that, as opposed to the conventional form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), the cerebellar efferent input to the motor cortices was normal. These clinical and electrophysiological pictures are distinct from those of familial essential tremor, familial essential myoclonus, or the conventional form of PME, and the term \"familial cortical myoclonic tremor\" will represent the clinical and electrophysiological features of this unique entity most appropriately.",

    "51": "A single class from a northeastern medical school was surveyed in both its first year (February 1991, 176 students) and its third year (May 1993, 170 students). The students were asked to report how frequently during the prior year they had used drugs or alcohol, and whether their use of each substance had increased, decreased, or remained the same since entering medical school; to identify any family members with histories of alcohol or drug problems; and to report any incidence during the prior year of ten behaviors associated with substance dependence. The students were also asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with 11 attitudinal statements. Additional attitudinal items asked the students to identify three major deterrents to the abuse of drugs and alcohol, and what they had done if they had become aware of a classmate with a drug or alcohol problem. Chi-square analysis and two-tailed t-tests were used to compare data from the two surveys.", 
    "52": "The response rates in the first and second surveys were 96.9% and 81.8%, respectively. Use of licit and illicit substances was comparable to that of chronological peers and prior national studies of medical trainees. Most of the students admitted to using alcohol at least once in the prior year (91.8% and 95%, respectively). In both years marijuana was the illicit drug used most often. Although there was a slight increase over time in the use of benzodiazepines (2.4% to 5.8%) and a decrease in the use of marijuana (29.4% to 21.7%), these changes were not significant. Few of the students in their third year reported using any substance other than alcohol more than once a month. In general, a greater percentage of the students reported a decrease rather than an increase in the use of a substance since entering medical school; the primary exception was for wine. As they progressed in their training, the students became less concerned about the effect of substance use on their performance and more likely to be embarrassed about admitting to an addiction. Although in each year a few of the students appeared to be at risk for substance dependence (8.9% and 3.5%, respectively), no student came to the attention of the administration because of problems related to substance use. While most of the students were unaware of any classmate who had a problem, half of those who were aware had done nothing, and the balance had rarely sought assistance from the faculty or administration.", 
    "53": "Although there was no evidence that substance use was a major problem, a few of the students appeared to be at risk for drug or alcohol dependence.

As part of a dose tolerance trial, the single- (SD) and multiple-dose (MD) pharmacokinetics of MDL 26479 were evaluated in healthy male volunteers. SDs ranging from 2 to 465 mg, and doses of 30, 60, and 120 mg administered twice daily for 28 d, were examined. Serial blood samples were collected for up to 48 h. Plasma MDL 26479 concentrations were determined by HPLC. Plasma MDL 26479 concentration versus time profiles increased rapidly, followed by multiexponential decline. Time to maximum plasma concentration increased over the 230-fold SD range from 0.5 to 3.8 h. Maximum concentrations and areas under the concentration versus time curves increased disproportionately with dose. Apparent oral clearance estimates decreased from 52.9 to 13.8 Lh-1. MD pharmacokinetic parameters for doses from 30 to 120 mg were consistent with those observed following SD, thus indicating that SD pharmacokinetics are predictive of MD. SD and MD terminal half-life estimates were similar and independent of dose.", 
    "59": "Many benzodiazepines (BZPs) are now used as anxiolytics with nearly 200-fold variety of therapeutic doses. The variation of the doses of BZPs is due to differences both in their pharmacokinetics and in their receptor binding characteristics. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism of the differences in therapeutic dose by retrospective analyses and to develop a system for the quantitative estimation of optimal doses of BZPs. The values of receptor dissociation constant (Kd), which indicates the binding affinity of each BZP at the receptor site, were obtained from a number of works based on in vitro binding experiments. The plasma unbound concentrations of the BZPs and their active metabolites were calculated using the reported values of their total plasma concentrations after average oral doses of the BZPs and the values of their plasma unbound fractions, which were also taken from the literature. There were log-linear relationships between the Kd values of BZPs and their average therapeutic doses or maximum plasma concentrations, but the correlation coefficients were relatively small (r < 0.77). In contrast, a good log-linearity (r = 0.96) was observed in the correlation between their Kd values and the effective plasma unbound concentrations considering the active metabolites. This finding indicates that the receptor occupancy after administration of therapeutic dose of BZPs is consistent (52.3 +/- 3.2%) among the BZPs. In this study, we also develop a possible system for estimating the appropriate doses of BZPs based on receptor occupancy theory.", 
    "60": "Insulin-induced hypoglycemia inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and has been used as a model to study stress-induced inhibition of reproductive function. Endogenous opioid peptides have been implicated in mediating the inhibitory effect of hypoglycemia on LH secretion in sheep and rat. The objective of the present study was to determine if corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and endogenous opiates are involved in the LH response to hypoglycemia in the nonhuman primate. Blood samples were collected at 15-min intervals for 6 h from ovariectomized rhesus monkeys (n = 6). Hypoglycemia was induced by injecting insulin 1 h after initiating blood collection. Animals were pretreated 15 min prior to insulin with either saline (n = 6), naloxone, a nonselective opiate receptor antagonist (n = 4), or alprazolam (n = 6), a potent benzodiazepine which has been shown to inhibit CRH. The LH, glucose, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and cortisol responses to insulin were determined. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia significantly inhibited LH secretion and increased ACTH and cortisol concentrations. Alprazolam prevented hypoglycemia-induced inhibition of LH independent of an effect on glucose concentrations. The mean (+/- SEM) LH pulse interval in response to hypoglycemia was decreased in the alprazolam pretreated group compared to the saline pretreated group (77.4 +/- 6.0 vs. 130.0 +/- 18.4 min), while LH pulse amplitude and mean LH levels were significantly increased (56.2 +/- 7.1 vs. 28.3 +/- 5.5 ng/ml, and 105.6 +/- 14.4 vs. 60.9 +/- 12.1 ng/ml respectively). In contrast, naloxone did not prevent hypoglycemia-induced LH inhibition. The mean LH pulse interval, LH pulse amplitude, and LH concentration in the naloxone pretreated monkeys were 152.1 +/- 33.4 min, 37.1 +/- 8.9 ng/ml, and 63.7 +/- 9.1 ng/ml respectively. Alprazolam pretreatment also markedly attenuated the ACTH response to hypoglycemia whereas the cortisol response was only moderately affected. We conclude that insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the monkey inhibits LH secretion through a mechanism involving CRH but not endogenous opiates.", 
    "61": "The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction between valproate and lorazepam was evaluated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Sixteen healthy male volunteers enrolled in the study to receive either divalproex sodium (500 mg every 12 hours) or matching placebo for 12 days in the first period, and then to receive the other regimen for an identical second 12-day period. In both periods, lorazepam (1 mg every 12 hours) was administered on days 6 through 9 and on the morning of day 10. Concomitant administration of divalproex sodium with lorazepam resulted in an 8%, 20%, and 31% increase in steady-state maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration-time curve, and trough plasma concentrations of lorazepam, respectively. The apparent clearance of lorazepam through the formation of lorazepam glucuronide was reduced by 31% during coadministration of divalproex sodium. Pharmacokinetic properties of valproate did not change significantly in the ten available participants during coadministration of lorazepam. Sedation scales revealed no statistically significant differences in sedation between the two regimens. It is concluded that valproate increases plasma concentrations and reduces clearance of lorazepam, most likely by impairing hepatic glucuronidation, and that coadministration of lorazepam does not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetic properties of valproate.",

There was no radio-activity in exhaled breath, and excretion of total radioactivity was approximately 50% in urine and 30% in feces; parent CZ was a minor component in the excreta. The metabolic profiles were determined in urine and feces using HPLC coupled with radioactivity monitoring. The major metabolic pathways were demethylation, oxidation of the aromatic ring in the 7- and 8-positions, and conjugation. The major urinary components were 8-hydroxy-deschloro-DCZ (desmethylCZ) and its glucuronide, 7-hydroxy-8-chloro-DCZ sulfate and CZ-NO (clozapine N-oxide). Minor amounts of CZ, 7-hydroxy-8-chloro-CZ glucuronide and DCZ were also present. In feces the major component was CZ-N-glucuronide. Urinary excretion of CZ-NO was more rapid than the products of aromatic ring hydroxylation and conjugation.",

The pharmacokinetics, excretion, and metabolism of OLZ were studied in CD-1 mice, beagle dogs, and rhesus monkeys after a single oral and/or intravenous dose of [14C]OLZ. After oral administration, OLZ was well absorbed in dogs (absolute bioavailability of 73%) and to the extent of at least 55% in monkeys and 32% in mice. The terminal elimination half-life of OLZ was relatively short in mice and monkeys (approximately 3 hr) and long in dogs (approximately 9 hr). In mice and dogs, radioactivity was predominantly eliminated in feces; but, in monkeys, the major route of elimination of radioactivity was urine. Dogs and monkeys excreted in urine, respectively, 38% and 55% of the dose over a 168-hr period, whereas the fraction of the dose excreted in urine of mice over the collection period (120 hr) was 32%. OLZ was subject to substantial first-pass metabolism; at the tmax, OLZ accounted for 19%, 18%, and 8% of the radioactivity, in mice, dogs, and monkeys, respectively. The ratio of AUC OLZ to AUC radioactivity was, respectively, 10%, 14%, and 4% in mice, dogs, and monkeys. The principal urinary metabolites in mice were 7-hydroxy OLZ glucuronide, 2-hydroxymethyl OLZ, and 2-carboxy OLZ accounting for approximately 10%, 4%, and 2% of the dose. Metabolites that were present in urine in lesser amounts were 7-hydroxy OLZ, N-desmethyl OLZ, and N-desmethyl-2-hydroxymethyl OLZ. In dogs, the major metabolite accounting for approximately 8% of the dose was 7-hydroxy-N-oxide OLZ. Other metabolites identified were 2-hydroxymethyl OLZ, 2-carboxy OLZ, N-oxide OLZ, 7-hydroxy OLZ, and its glucuronide and N-desmethyl OLZ. The major metabolite in monkey urine was N-desmethyl-2-carboxy OLZ, and accounted for approximately 17% of the dose. In addition, N-oxide-2-hydroxymethyl, 2-carboxyl OLZ, and 2-hydroxymethyl OLZ were identified in monkey urine. Thus, in mice and dogs, OLZ was metabolized through aromatic hydroxylation, allylic oxidation, N-dealkylation, and N-oxidation reactions. In monkeys, OLZ was biotransformed mainly through double oxidation reactions involving the allylic carbon and methyl piperazine nitrogen. Whereas the oxidative metabolic profile of OLZ in animals was similar to that of humans, animals were notable for not forming appreciable amounts of the principal human metabolite (i.e. 10-N-glucuronide OLZ).", 
    "64": "The effect of sulphated cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8S) on extracellular dynorphin B, aspartate, glutamate and GABA levels in the rat fronto-parietal cortex was investigated with in vivo microdialysis. The peptide was infused through the microdialysis probe trying to mimic local CCK-8S release. Basal levels of dynorphin B were around 20 pM, aspartate 100 nM, glutamate 600 nM and GABA 30 nM. CCK-8S (10 microM) induced a approximately 3-fold increase in extracellular dynorphin B, aspartate and glutamate levels, while GABA levels were only slightly increased. The effect of CCK-8S was restricted to the stimulated neocortex. Systemic pretreatment with the CCKB antagonist, L-365, 260, but not with the CCKA antagonist, L-364, 718, significantly antagonised the effect of CCK-8S on cortical dynorphin B and aspartate release. However, both CCKA and CCKB antagonists inhibited the increase in cortical glutamate levels. Thus, the present results indicate that cortical CCK release exerts a stimulatory modulation on cortical dynorphin B and aspartate release via the CCKB receptor subtype, and on glutamate release via both CCKA and CCKB receptor subtypes. Considering electrophysiological evidence that CCK increases neuronal firing rates in many brain regions, it may be suggested that CCK represents a stimulatory system modulating the function of the neocortex.",

Under the condition for detecting the messages of m1-m4 subtypes in brain, atrium, and gastric mucosa, only the fragments of m2 and m3 subtypes were amplified with RNA prepared from rat gastric smooth muscles. Furthermore, the amplified fragments were digested by restriction enzymes, reconfirming that the predicted size products of m2 and m3 contain the partial DNA sequences of m2 and m3 subtypes, respectively. We measured gastric motility in rats with a pressure transducer system under the continuous venous infusion of the muscarinic antagonists atropine and butylscopolamine (nonselective), AF-DX 116 (M2), zamifenacine (M3), and glucagon. Heart rate was monitored simultaneously in the tail. Gastric motility was inhibited in the presence of glucagon and zamifenacine without alteration of heart rate, whereas there was no inhibition in the presence of AF-DX 116 even after the augmentation of heart rate was observed. Gastric emptying was also suppressed in the presence of zamifenacine, which had an effect comparable with that of atropine, butylscopolamine, and glucagon. These results indicate that the activation of the M3 subtype in gastric smooth muscle causes its contraction, and the M3 selective antagonist could be a potentially useful drug without an adverse effect on the heart for radiological and endoscopic examination in the upper gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "73": "1. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting via the GABAA receptor, increased the extracellular acidification rate of rat primary cultured cerebellar granule cells, measured by the Cytosensor microphysiometer. 2. The optimal conditions for the measurement of GABAA receptor function in cerebellar granule cells by microphysiometry were: cells seeded at 9-12 x 10(5) cells/transwell cup and maintained in vitro for 8 days, GABA stimulation performed at 25 degrees C, with a stimulation time of 33 s. 3. GABA stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in the extracellular acidification rate with an EC50 of 2.0 +/- 0.2 microM (mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 7 experiments) and maximal increase (Emax) over basal response of 15.4 +/- 1.2%. 4. The sub-maximal GABA-stimulated increase in acidification rate could be potentiated by the 1,4-benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam (100 nM). The 10 nM GABA response showed the maximal benzodiazepine facilitation (GABA alone, 1.4 microV s-1, GABA + flunitrazepam, 3.8 microV s-1, mean increment over basal, n = 7). 5. The GABA-stimulated increase in acidification rate was inhibited by the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline (100 microM) (90% inhibition at 1 mM GABA). 6. The results of this study show that activation of GABAA receptors in rat cerebellar granule cells caused an increase in the extracellular acidification rate; an effect which was potentiated by benzodiazepines and inhibited by a GABAA receptor antagonist. This paper defines the conditions and confirms the feasibility of using microphysiometry to investigate GABAA receptor function in primary cultured CNS neurones. The microphysiometer provides a rapid and sensitive technique to investigate the regulation of the GABAA receptor in populations of neurones.", 
    "74": "1. The nature of the muscarinic receptor involved in mediating cardiovascular changes caused by unilateral microinjection of carbachol (5 nmol) into, and electrical stimulation (200-300 microA) of, the amygdaloid complex was investigated in conscious, unrestrained female Sprague-Dawley rats. 2. Unilateral microinjection of carbachol (5 nmol; n = 6) and electrical stimulation (200-300 microA, 80 Hz, 30 s; n = 4) caused a significant rise in blood pressure of 21 +/- 4 mmHg and 25 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively. These changes were associated with no overall effect on heart rate. The effects of electrical stimulation were found to be repeatable. 3. Pretreatment i.c.v. with pirenzepine (5-20 mmol; n = 6-7 for each dose), dose-dependently inhibited the rise in blood pressure induced by carbachol, whereas AF-DX 116 (100 nmol; n = 6) failed to have any effect on the carbachol-induced pressure response. Neither antagonist alone had any effect on resting baseline variables. 4. Unilateral microinjections of atropine sulphate (1-100 nmol; n = 4-6 for each dose), pirenzepine (0.03-10 nmol; n = 4 for each dose) or AF-DX 116 (10-60 nmol; n = 4-5 for each dose), into the amygdala, dose-dependently inhibited the rise in blood pressure caused by electrical stimulation (200-300 microA). The ID50 values were 1.05, 0.23 and 39.5 nmol, respectively. Although pirenzepine seemed to be more potent than atropine, this difference was not significant. 5. It is concluded that the rise in blood pressure elicited by unilateral microinjection of carbachol into, or electrical stimulation of, the amygdaloid complex is mediated by M1-muscarinic receptors.", 
    "75": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) exert their therapeutic effects in the mammalian central nervous system at least in part by modulating the activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated chloride channels. To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of BZs on GABA receptors, we have been investigating structural determinants required for the actions of the BZ diazepam (dzp) on recombinant alpha1 beta2 gamma2 GABA(A) receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce point mutations into the alpha1 and gamma2 GABA(A) receptor subunits. Wild-type and mutant GABA(A) receptors were then expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells and studied using two-electrode voltage-clamp and ligand-binding techniques. With this approach, we identified two tyrosine residues on the alpha1 subunit (Tyr159 and Tyr209) that when mutated to serine, dramatically impaired modulation by dzp. The Y209S substitution resulted in a >7-fold increase in the EC50 for dzp, and the Y159S substitution nearly abolished dzp-mediated potentiation. Both of these mutations abolished binding of the high affinity BZ receptor antagonist [3H]Ro 15-1788 to GABA(A) receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. These tyrosine residues correspond to two tyrosines of the beta2 subunit (Tyr157 and Tyr205) previously postulated to form part of the GABA-binding site. Mutation of the corresponding tyrosine residues on the gamma2 subunit produced only a slight increase in the EC50 for dzp (approximately 2-fold) with no significant effect on the binding affinity of [3H]Ro 15-1788. These data suggest that Tyr159 and Tyr209 of the alpha1 subunit may be components of the BZ-binding site on alpha1 beta2 gamma2 GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "76": "The purpose of this retrospective study is to test the hypothesis that lifetime substance abuse has an adverse impact on survival after bone marrow transplant (BMT). This study included 17 of 468 patients admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts who were identified to have lifetime substance abuse (SA). Seventeen comparison subjects were selected from the admissions roster if they matched for disease and stage, type of transplant, pretransplant conditioning regimen, and age, but did not have SA. The medical records of all 34 patients were then reviewed by expert substance abuse clinicians for confirmation of SA and course of transplant. Survival time was calculated from the date of BMT admission to the date of last contact. Survival data were analyzed through Kaplan Meier survival curves and log rank tests for association of survival time with lifetime SA, both before and after stratification for history of cigarette smoking and type of transplant. The patients with and without SA were well matched for all clinical factors. Substance abuse or dependence was confirmed in all 17 patients, with alcohol (71%), marijuana (30%), and opiates (30%) identified as the principal substances of abuse. Survival analysis demonstrated reduced survival times for patients with SA, p = .0022. This difference persisted after stratifying for type of transplant and cigarette smoking. Trends in different survival times by type of transplant (p = .054) and by history of cigarette smoking (p = .07) were also identified. Lifetime substance abuse or dependence appears to have an adverse association with survival after bone marrow transplant when other clinical factors are equal.", 
    "77": "Detection of benzyolecgonine, the major metabolite of cocaine, in the urinalysis conducted on the first day of an inpatient heroin detoxification treatment program was studied as a predictor of discharge against medical advice (AMA). With this aim, we conducted a chart-review procedure of 275 heroin dependents (DSM-III-R) who received methadone or dextropropoxyphene chlorhydrate to treat Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome. Data were analyzed following a case-control design. The 49 (17.8%) patients who did not complete the treatment due to discharged AMA were characterized by having achieved total heroin abstinence during fewer months from the time they began consumption of this substance to the time of hospitalization (p = .001). Moreover, those patients who requested discharge AMA were characterized by more frequent detection of benzoylecgonine in their urine on the day of admission (p = .004). The value of the odds ratio of this association was 3.81 (95% CI; 1.30 to 11.04). Lastly, noncompleters due to discharge AMA were more likely to be single than ever married (p = .037). The logistic regression model confirmed that there is a significant relationship between an AMA event and the presence of benzoylecgonine in urine upon beginning detoxification and to a shorter duration of the period of total heroin abstinence. In the discussion, the influence that recent interruption of cocaine consumption has on the decision to drop out of a detoxification program AMA is considered.", 
    "78": "We studied the performance of a target-controlled drug infusion device, computer-assisted continuous infusion (CACI). Forty-one volunteers received one of midazolam (n = 11), propofol (n = 10), thiopental (n = 10), or fentanyl (n = 10) in sedative concentrations. Concentrations were kept constant for 45-70 min at five sequential target concentrations in each subject. Twenty-six subjects had arterial sampling and 15 had venous sampling to determine drug concentrations. Median performance errors, median absolute performance error (MDAPE), wobble, divergence, and median absolute constancy error (MDACE), defined as error around mean actual concentration at each target, were calculated. CACI demonstrated significant performance errors, which were different among drugs. MDAPE (5%-95% confidence interval) ranged from 22.9% (12.1%-39.6%) for propofol to 82.2% (36.0%-183.0%) for midazolam. Although performance errors could be large, CACI was able to maintain a constant serum concentration over time very successfully. The MDACE ranged from 5.6% (3.9%-17.3%) for fentanyl to 11.2% (8.9%-20.4%) for propofol. Few differences occurred between arterial and venous sampling, although when they occurred, arterial samples indicated larger errors. It is concluded that CACI is very successful at maintaining constant serum concentrations of these drugs at sedative concentrations. Arterial sampling should be used when the performance characteristics of an infusion device are being tested. However, venous sampling may be adequate to determine serum concentrations when a pseudo-steady state has been achieved.",

The AB protocol caused significant decreases in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures, compared with DK and the nonsedation protocols. Mean GFR for the BD protocol was 2.94 ml/min/kg, and was 3.13 ml/min/kg for the AB and the nonsedation protocols.

All benzodiazepines produce amnestic effects, but the short duration of action, lack of long-acting metabolites, and potent amnestic effects make lorazepam and midazolam preferable in this setting. Infusions of propofol for conscious sedation produce concentrations below those required for consistent amnesia. Opioids generally do not produce amnesia; however, end-organ failure and use of high doses of opioids may increase plasma concentrations to levels that produce impairment of learning and various degrees of amnesia. High infusion rates of ketamine may be required for satisfactory amnesia and pain control (with coadministration of benzodiazepine). Barbiturates and haloperidol do not impair memory in patients who are not critically ill. Antihistamines and anticholinergics that do not penetrate the central nervous system do not produce amnesia. Flumazenil may induce recall.",

    "90": "Intrastriatal microdialysis was used to administer muscarinic drugs in freely moving rats for 40 min at a flow rate of 2 microl/min. Administration of the nonselective agonist pilocarpine at 10 mM increased striatal dopamine release and decreased extracellular GABA and glutamate overflow. Perfusion with the muscarinic M2 antagonist methoctramine at 75 microM increased extracellular dopamine and glutamate concentrations but exerted no changes on extracellular GABA levels. Intrastriatal administration of the M1 antagonist pirenzepine at 0.05 microM decreased extracellular dopamine overflow. Application of pirenzepine (0.05 and 5 microM) exerted no effects on the measured GABA or glutamate levels. There are thus important differences in applied doses of muscarinic drugs needed to obtain modulatory effects. High doses of agonists are probably needed to superimpose on the background of tonic influences of striatal acetylcholine, whereas antagonists can block the receptors in small doses. We further suggest that M1 receptors might tonically facilitate striatal dopamine release, that M2 receptors might tonically inhibit striatal glutamate efflux, and that acetylcholine does not exert tonic effects on striatal GABA release. The link with the pilocarpine animal model for temporal lobe epilepsy will be discussed.",

    "92": "A recent postmortem study has reported that there is a widespread upregulation of GABA(A) receptor binding activity throughout most subregions of the hippocampal formation of schizophrenic brain. The current study has been undertaken to determine whether the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor, which is a component of the GABA(A) receptor complex, may also be upregulated in schizophrenics. Using a low-resolution film autoradiographic technique to localize [3H]flunitrazepam binding, the subregional and laminar distribution of specific BZ receptor binding was found to parallel that of the GABA(A) site, except in the area dentata where BZ binding was approximately 73% higher in the outer molecular layer. When BZ receptor binding was compared in the same normal control (n = 15) and schizophrenic (n = 8) cases in which the GABA(A) receptor was analyzed, there were very few differences noted between the two groups, except for small, though significant, increases in the stratum oriens of CA3 (30%), the subiculum (20-30%) and the presubiculum (15-20%) of the patient group. These latter increases overlapped with the subregions and laminae in schizophrenics showing the most marked increases of GABA(A) receptor binding. Using a high-resolution technique to evaluate specific BZ receptor binding on different neuronal subtypes, no difference was observed on either pyramidal or nonpyramidal neurons of sector CA3 where GABA(A) receptor activity had been found to be significantly increased on the latter neuronal subtype. The potential confounding effects of age, postmortem interval and exposure to either benzodiazepine or neuroleptic drugs do not account for the lack of marked differences in BZ receptor binding in the schizophrenic group. Taken together, the results of this study are consistent with the possibility that defective GABAergic integration in schizophrenia may be associated with an uncoupling in the regulation of the GABA(A) and BZ receptors.", 
    "93": "Recently a molecular model was proposed for the binding site of the antagonist 3S(-)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-yl) -1H-indole-2-carboxamide (devazepide) on the cholecystokinin-A (CCK(A)) receptor (Van der Bent et al., 1994. Drug Design Discov. 12, 129-148). Fifteen amino acids were identified, including hydrophilic ones such as Ser139, Asn349 and Ser379, that might interact with the carboxamide moiety in devazepide. To provide mutational evidence for this model, wild-type and mutant receptors (S139A, N349A and S379A) were transiently expressed and compared with respect to the ability of devazepide to inhibit binding of radiolabelled cholecystokinin-(26-33)-peptide amide (CCK-8) and CCK-8-evoked Ca2+ mobilization. The data presented suggest the involvement of the three residues in antagonist binding, although to a different extent. However, it does not seem likely that hydrogen bonds are the driving force in view of the relatively minor changes in receptor affinity and activity.", 
    "94": "The neurosteroid 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) was administered systemically to rats which were tested in the Geller-Seifter conflict paradigm, an established animal model of anxiety. Allopregnanolone was found to produce significant anxiolytic-like effects at a dose of 8 mg/kg. When three ligands that function at different sites on the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex (GABA(A) receptors) were examined in conjunction with allopregnanolone, the anti-conflict effects of allopregnanolone were effectively reversed only by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist RO15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5-alpha]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate). Since this inverse agonist has been reported to inhibit the GABA(A)-activated chloride flux in neuronal membranes, it is likely that the stimulation of the chloride channel in GABA(A) receptors is an important component of the effects of allopregnanolone. In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5-alpha]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) did not block the anxiolytic-like actions of allopregnanolone, indicating that allopregnanolone does not bind at the benzodiazepine site directly. Isopropylbicyclophosphate, which binds at the picrotoxinin site on the GABA(A) receptors and blocks the behavioral actions of ethanol, also dose-dependently reversed the anti-conflict effect of this neurosteroid. The results suggest that allopregnanolone may be working either at a site specific for the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist RO15-4513 or at the picrotoxinin site to produce its potent anxiolytic-like behavioral effects.", 
    "95": "Labeling of the two more important gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) supramolecular sites with [3H] muscimol (GABA(A)) and [3H] flunitrazepam (benzodiazepine) provided saturable, stable, and dimorphic binding activities in cortical and limbic regions of the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus. Of the cortical layers, which contained the highest [3H] muscimol binding levels, only the female lamina V supplied a greater (51%; P <0.01) receptor density than in the male. Areas of the limbic system instead proved to be the more favorable targets for differential GABA(A) binding levels. The highest (P <0.001) and higher levels were found in the oriens-pyramidalis CA1 layer of the hippocampus (65%) and in the vertical limb diagonal band-medial septal nucleus (48%), basolateral amygdala nucleus (45%), and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (43%), respectively, of the female. A similar pattern was obtained for [3H]flunitrazepam binding activity, especially in the presence of GABA. The highest and higher binding activities were obtained in the female central amygdala nucleus (78%) and in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (52%), basolateral amygdala nucleus (48%), and oriens-pyramidalis CA1 layer of the hippocampus (47%), respectively, whereas higher levels were observed only in the male vertical limb diagonal band-medial septal nucleus (56%). Even in the cortical regions, the female exhibited higher (42%; cortex lamina V) and moderately higher (38%; cortex lamina VI) levels, with binding differences in the latter site plus in the basolateral amygdala nucleus occurring in a GABA-nondependent manner. From the saturation binding analyses it was possible to reveal that both maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) and mean dissociation constant (K(D)) modifications were responsible for receptor differences of the two GABAergic sites. These findings tend to suggest that dimorphic variations of the GABA(A) supramolecular sites, in some cortical and limbic regions, are strongly involved in sex-specific aggressive and reproductive activities of rodents living in their natural habitats.", 
    "96": "A 71-year-old man was found dead in a car into which exhaust fumes had been introduced. His wife who was in the same car recovered consciousness following hospitalization. She claimed that they had both attempted suicide by taking a large number of sleeping pills. Autopsy revealed no significant external injuries or medical disorders that would have led to the husband's death. The concentrations of alcohol and carbon-monoxide hemoglobin in his whole blood were 0.26 mg/ml and < 10%, respectively. Therefore, poisoning by carbon monoxide from the exhaust fumes was ruled out, and further toxicological examinations were undertaken. Triazolam, pentobarbital, amitriptyline and bromazepam were all detected in the tissues of the victim; whole blood concentrations were 45.60, 386.4, 521.2 and 166.7 ng/g, respectively. Triazolam (7.350 ng/g) and pentobarbital (288.2 ng/g) were also detected in the whole blood of the wife, collected 17 h after admission to hospital. When evaluating these results in the light of existing literature, we concluded that the victim and his wife had indeed attempted suicide by taking triazolam and pentobarbital. However, only the man had died of triazolam poisoning due to its apparently lethal combination with amitriptyline and other psychotropic drugs which had been prescribed to treat his depression.", 
    "97": "Central noradrenergic systems have been shown to modulate the hypnotic activity of pentobarbital in mice. To determine whether the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor system is involved in the decrease in pentobarbital sleep caused by activation of central noradrenergic systems, we examined in mice the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor ligands flumazenil and FG7142 on pentobarbital-induced sleep, and on adrenoceptor ligand modulation of pentobarbital sleep. The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of methoxamine (8-200 nmol), an alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist, and yohimbine (1-30 nmol), an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, produced a dose-dependent decrease in sleeping time induced by pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). The i.c.v. administration of flumazenil (16.5 and 33 nmol), a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, had no effect on pentobarbital sleep, whereas an i.p. injection of FG7142, a selective benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, shortened pentobarbital sleep. Flumazenil (33 nmol, i.c.v.) caused the pentobarbital sleep time, shortened by methoxamine (200 nmol, i.c.v.) and yohimbine (30 nmol, i.c.v.), to return to the control level, while FG7142 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect on the methoxamine- and yohimbine-shortened pentobarbital sleep. These results suggest that putative endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligands with an inverse agonist-like property are involved in the methoxamine- and yohimbine-induced decrease in pentobarbital sleep in mice.", 
    "98": "We have recently reported that midazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist that is also a short acting anesthetic and analgesic drug, can produce analgesia and decrease morphine tolerance and dependence in the rat by interacting with the opioidergic system. This study was designed to investigate the chronic effect of midazolam and/or morphine on the levels of dynorphin(1-13) in the pituitary gland, different brain regions, spinal cord and peripheral tissues of the rat. Four sets of animals were used: (I) saline-saline; (II) midazolam (0.03, 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg, body wt., i.p.)-saline; (III) saline-morphine (10.0 mg/kg, body wt., s.c.); and (IV) midazolam-morphine (0.03, 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg midazolam + 10.0 mg/kg morphine) groups. The first saline or midazolam injection was given i.p. and after 30 min, the second injection of saline or morphine was given s.c. daily for 11 days. Animals were sacrificed on the 11th day, 60 min after the last injection and dynorphin(1-13) was measured in indicated tissues by radioimmunoassay method. The midazolam treated animals showed a significant decrease in dynorphin(1-13) levels in the cortex, cerebellum, cervical region of spinal cord, heart and adrenals, and a significant increase in the hypothalamus, striatum and lumbar region of the spinal cord. The morphine treated animals showed a significant decrease in dynorphin(1-13) levels in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, pons, medulla, kidneys, adrenals and spleen, and a significant increase only in the lumbar region of the spinal cord. When both drugs were injected together there was no effect on pituitary gland, kidneys and spleen. These drugs antagonize each other's effect on dynorphin(1-13) in the hypothalamus, striatum, cerebellum, pons, medulla and heart. However, the midazolam-morphine combination significantly increases dynorphin(1-13) levels in the hippocampus, cortex, midbrain, cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, and adrenals. These results suggest the involvement of dynorphin(1-13) in the inhibition of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence by midazolam in the rat. These results may also help us in understanding the intrinsic mechanisms involved in narcotic tolerance and dependence.", 
    "99": "In order to examine the expression of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit during chick cortical development in vivo and in vitro, we have utilized a polyclonal antibody (RP4) directed against an alpha1(331-381) fusion protein. This antibody exhibits a high titer for precipitation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in chick cortical extracts, no significant cross-reactivity with GABA(A) receptor beta2- or beta4-subunit fusion proteins, and a robust reaction with a single 51-kDa polypeptide on immunoblots of cortical membranes. This indicates monospecificity of the RP4 antiserum for the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit. The alpha1-subunit antibody also showed strong immunocytochemical reactions with neurons in the embryonic mediodorsal cortex and Purkinje cells of the chick cerebellum. The ontogeny of the alpha1 subunit in chick cortex and in derived neuronal cultures was examined by quantitative Western blotting. The level of the alpha1 polypeptide increased from day 2 to day 6 in culture, acquiring 50% of the maximum expression at day 4. Expression of the cortical GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit increased in vivo from embryonic day 8 (E8) to day 7 post-hatching, reaching 50% of adult levels at E16. Levels of the corresponding alpha1-subunit mRNA, analyzed from E8 to E20 by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), showed a corresponding incline. These findings correlated well with previous developmental studies of GABA(A) receptor ligand binding sites both in vivo and in vitro. The parallel increase of the alpha1 subunit transcript and polypeptide with [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites suggests that this subunit may be an important component of GABA(A) receptors early in cortical ontogeny. This was investigated further by quantitative immunoprecipitation. At saturation, the RP4 antiserum consistently precipitated 50-65% of the central [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the developing cortex from E12 through P7, despite a 5-fold increase in the binding level. The data suggest that during cortical development the fraction of GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1 subunits remains relatively constant. Furthermore, the alpha1 polypeptide appears to be a major component of GABA(A) receptor oligomers at all stages of cortical maturation.", 
    "100": "Peptide fragments of a porcine benzodiazepine-binding protein were used to isolate the cDNA of a related human protein. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 312 amino acid residues that is homologous to a bacterial pyridoxal kinase. Transient expression of the cDNA in human embryonic kidney cells confirmed that it encodes human pyridoxal kinase. The recombinant enzyme displayed a Km value of 3.3 microM for pyridoxal and was inhibited competitively by 4-deoxypyridoxine (Ki = 2.8 microM). Benzodiazepine receptor ligands that bound to the purified porcine protein also exerted a potent inhibitory effect on human pyridoxal kinase activity. Transcripts of the pyridoxal kinase gene were detectable in all human tissues examined, and were particularly abundant in the testes. The gene is localized on chromosome 21q22.3 and represents a candidate gene for at least one genetic disorder that has been mapped to this region (autoimmune polyglandular disease type 1).", 
    "101": "We have used whole-cell recordings and rapid agonist applications to characterize the physiological properties of kainate receptors expressed by rat hippocampal neurons in dissociated cell culture. Activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors was prevented by inclusion of the noncompetitive antagonists MK-801 (2 microM) and GYKI 53655 (100 microM), respectively. In the presence of these inhibitors, both kainate (EC50 = 23 microM) and glutamate (EC50 = 310 microM) evoked desensitizing currents. Maximal peak currents for kainate with GYKI 53655 were 15 +/- 3% as large as in control solutions without GYKI. In contrast to currents mediated by AMPA receptors, kainate currents recorded in GYKI were blocked potently by lanthanum (IC50 = 2 microM) and were desensitized by 1 microM 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate (SYM 2081). Coapplication of either 5 microM AMPA or 500 microM aspartate had little effect on responses to kainate, although AMPA alone elicited current at 1 mM. In most cells, the currents evoked by kainate, glutamate, and SYM 2081 varied linearly with membrane potential and reversed near 0 mV. Kainate elicited substantial current at steady state (approximately 30% of peak), whereas responses to glutamate and SYM 2081 desensitized almost completely within 0.2-2 sec. Inhibition produced by a 10 sec desensitizing prepulse was half-maximal at 0.22 microM for SYM 2081 and 13 microM for glutamate. Recovery from desensitization to kainate and glutamate was >80% complete within 60 sec but was three- to fourfold slower after exposure to SYM 2081. Exposure to Concanavalin A blocked desensitization of the currents but also reduced the peak current amplitudes. Collectively, these results confirm that kainate-preferring receptors underlie the currents evoked by kainate, glutamate, or SYM-2081 in the presence of GYKI 53655; they are not mediated by electrogenic transport or by AMPA-preferring receptors that are insensitive to GYKI. In contrast to previous work on embryonic hippocampal neurons, our results show that the properties of kainate receptors expressed by cells from older animals are distinct from those displayed by homomeric assemblies of the GluR6 subunit.", 
    "102": "Buprenorphine's clinical utility as an opioid dependence pharmacotherapy may be enhanced with less-than-daily dosing. This study assessed opioid withdrawal after an acute 72 h dose omission in buprenorphine-maintained patients (8 mg/day s.l.). Eight outpatients required to remain free of opioids, cocaine and benzodiazepines completed four double-blind, double-dummy, Latin-square ordered conditions. Test conditions of 8 or 16 mg s.l. buprenorphine were followed by 2 days of placebo dosing. Control conditions were buprenorphine maintenance (8 mg/day), to provide a reference for evaluation of placebo test days and naloxone administration (10 mg 70 kg i.m.) during 8 mg buprenorphine maintenance to assess withdrawal measure sensitivity. Subjective measures and pupil diameter were significantly influenced only by naloxone. The lack of subjective symptoms and physiological signs of opioid withdrawal during 72 h of acute dose omission supports the feasibility of less-than-daily dosing at buprenorphine doses of 8 mg/day in patients who have demonstrated an ability to remain drug-free for an extended period.", 
    "103": "The effects of several NMDA receptor antagonists on pentylenetetrazole-induced diazepam-withdrawal seizure were examined in mice. The decrease in the seizure threshold for pentylenetetrazole during diazepam withdrawal was inhibited by pretreatment with MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cycloheptan-5,10-imine maleate), 7-chlorokynurenic acid and ifenprodil. Furthermore, MK-801 and ifenprodil, at doses which did not affect the threshold of pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in control mice, also significantly suppressed the decrease in the seizure threshold during diazepam withdrawal, whereas 7-chlorokynurenic acid did not. These findings suggest that overactivity of an ion channel site and an ifenprodil binding site on the NMDA receptor may play an important role in the hypersensitivity of pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in diazepam-withdrawn mice.", 
    "104": "Social isolation stress has been demonstrated to decrease the hypnotic activity of ethanol in rodents. In this study, the role of central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and GABA(A)/benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor systems in the social isolation stress-induced decrease in the hypnotic activity of ethanol in mice was investigated by examining the effect of alpha-helical CRF(9-41) (alpha hCRF) and flumazenil, antagonists of CRF and BZD receptors, respectively, on ethanol-induced sleep in group-housed and socially isolated mice. We also tested whether social isolation stress affects the ability of ethanol to enhance the GABA-induced 36Cl- influx into a synaptoneurosomal preparation of mouse forebrain. Social isolation stress significantly decreased both the ethanol (4 g/kg i.p.)-induced and pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.)-induced sleeping times, while this stress had no effect on chloral hydrate (325 mg/kg i.p.)-induced sleep. The i.c.v. injection of alpha hCRF (6.5 nmol) and flumazenil (33 nmol) antagonized the social isolation stress-induced decrease in the ethanol sleep without affecting ethanol sleep in group-housed animals. Social isolation stress significantly attenuated the ability of GABA to stimulate 36Cl- influx but this stress had no effect on the ability of ethanol to enhance GABA-induced 36Cl- influx. These results suggest that the functional changes in central CRF and GABA(A)/BZD receptor systems are involved in the social isolation stress-induced decrease in the hypnotic activity of ethanol in mice.", 
    "105": "Evans blue dye, given i.c.v. in rats in a dose of 208 nmol, causes electrical and behavioural seizures which resemble those induced by the glutamate analogue, kainate, or by electrical kindling of the amygdala. Chicago sky blue, 201 nmol i.c.v., produces similar seizures. The principal elements of the seizures are wet-rat-shakes, facial and forelimb clonus, rearing and spike-and-waves in the EEG. A non-NMDA receptor antagonist, GYKI 52466 and a benzodiazepine, diazepam, significantly delay the onset to the occurrence of the first forelimb clonus. The cholinergic antagonist, scopolamine, significantly reduces the delay to onset of first facial clonus. The competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, D-CPPene, the non-specific dopamine antagonist, haloperidol, and the purinergic agonist, 2-chloroadenosine, have no effect on the measured parameters. During the induction of seizures by Evans blue, the average extracellular glutamate concentration in hippocampus or cortex does not increase statistically significantly in comparison to pre-seizure values. Histological examination of limbic areas indicates that the moderate to severe Evans blue-induced cell damage is similar to that seen after limbic seizures induced by pilocarpine and in the hippocampus is partially preventable by D-CPPene but not by diazepam or GYKI 52466. It is proposed that Evans blue-induced seizures may be useful as a new model for studying the mechanisms of intractable epilepsy of the complex partial seizure type.", 
    "106": "The effect of restraint stress on c-jun mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation was investigated by in situ hybridization, dot blot and northern blot. c-jun mRNA expression increased after 60 min of forced restraint in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampal formation. The effect in the dentate gyrus was attenuated by pre-stress i.c.v. injection of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine midazolam (20 nmol/2 microl) or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP-7, 5 nmol/2 microl), but not by the 5-HT1A agonist, (+/-) 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 20 nmol/2 microl). These results suggest that the hippocampal formation is activated during restraint stress, and that this activation is modulated by benzodiazepine/GABA-A or NMDA receptors.", 
    "107": "Our previous publication (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995, 294, 411-422) reported preliminary chemical and biological studies of some 2,3-benzodiazepines, analogues of 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-(methylenedioxy)-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (1, GYKI 52466), which have been shown to possess significant anticonvulsant activity. This paper describes the synthesis of new 1-aryl-3,5-dihydro-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones and the evaluation of their anticonvulsant effects. The observed findings extend the structure-activity relationships previously suggested for this class of anticonvulsants. The seizures were evoked both by means of auditory stimulation in DBA/2 mice and by pentylenetetrazole or maximal electroshock in Swiss mice. 1-(4'-Aminophenyl)- (38) and 1-(3'-aminophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin- 4-one (39), the most active compounds of the series, proved to be more potent than 1 in all tests employed. In particular, the ED50 values against tonus evoked by auditory stimulation were 12.6 micromol/kg for derivative 38, 18.3 micromol/kg for 39, and 25.3 micromol/kg for 1. Higher doses were necessary to block tonic extension induced both by maximal electroshock and by pentylenetetrazole. In addition these compounds exhibited anticonvulsant properties that were longer lasting than those of compound 1 and were less toxic. The novel 2,3-benzodiazepines were also investigated for a possible correlation between their anticonvulsant activities against convulsions induced by 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) and their affinities for benzodiazepine receptors (BZR). The 2,3-benzodiazepines did not affect the binding of [3H]flumazenil to BZR, and conversely, their anticonvulsant effects were not reversed by flumazenil. On the other hand the 2,3-benzodiazepines antagonized seizures induced by AMPA and aniracetam in agreement with an involvement of the AMPA receptor. In addition, both the derivative 38 and the compound 1 markedly reduced the AMPA receptor-mediated membrane currents in guinea-pig olfactory cortical neurons in vitro in a noncompetitive manner. The derivatives 25 and 38-40 failed to displace specific ligands from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), AMPA/kainate, or metabotropic glutamate receptors.", 
    "108": "We studied the modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release by activation of kainate receptor in rat whole hippocampal synaptosomes. Kainate (10-300 microM) inhibited [3H]GABA release in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 25 microM. This effect of kainate (30 microM) was prevented by the ionotropic non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 microM) and by the selective kainate receptor antagonist 5-nitro-6,7,8,9-tetrahydrobenzo(g)indole-2,3-dione-3-oxime (NS-102, 10 microM), but not by the selective non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5 H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466, 100 microM). Other kainate receptor agonists, such as domoic acid (0.3-10 microM) and (2S,4R)-4-methylglutamic acid (MGA, 0.3-3 microM), also inhibited [3H]GABA release in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 values of 4.0 microM and 0.90 microM, respectively, whereas alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-oxazolepropionate (AMPA, 10-100 microM) was devoid of effect. These inhibitory effects of both domoic acid (3 microM) and MGA (1 microM) were antagonized by CNQX (10 microM). These results indicate that GABA release can be modulated directly by presynaptic high-affinity kainate heteroreceptors.", 
    "109": "Biochemical and electrophysiological approaches were used to assess possible changes in 5-HT1A receptors in the rat brain after long-term treatment with an anxiolytic benzodiazepine. Rats were treated with diazepam (2 mg/kg i.p. daily) during 14 days and then untreated for 1 day (protocol A) or 5 days (protocol C) until they were killed for in vitro investigations on 5-HT1A receptors. In addition, other rats (protocol B) received the same 14-day treatment with diazepam, followed by 1 mg/kg of the drug on days 15 and 16, and 0.5 mg/kg on days 17 and 18, and were killed 24 h after the last injection. In vitro binding and quantitative autoradiographic experiments with [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) showed that the characteristics of 5-HT1A receptor binding sites in the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe nucleus were not significantly altered by the administration of diazepam under the treatment protocols A, B and C. Furthermore, in vitro electrophysiological recordings of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of brain stem slices revealed no modification in the sensitivity of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in rats treated with diazepam according to the protocols A and B. However, under the conditions of protocol C, the potency of 8-OH-DPAT to depress the firing rate of serotoninergic neurons was significantly enhanced, as expected of a hypersensitivity of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. These data support the hypothesis that some functional changes in these receptors could occur during benzodiazepine withdrawal. However, they do not support the idea of a reduced anxiolytic efficacy of 5-HT1A receptor agonists as a result of prior treatment with a benzodiazepine.", 
    "110": "The ability of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone to potentiate the effects of subeffective doses of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and buspirone was evaluated in Swiss mice tested in an elevated plus maze. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (2.5 mg/kg) and buspirone (2 mg/kg) were ineffective per se but, when combined with naloxone (10 mg/kg), they increased the proportion of open arm entries as did higher doses of the anxiolytic agents (diazepam 1.5 mg/kg, chlordiazepoxide 5 mg/kg and buspirone 4 mg/kg). Naloxone alone (10 mg/kg) had no intrinsic effect. These data suggest that naloxone is able to potentiate the effects of anti-anxiety agents.", 
    "111": "The clinical efficacy, side effect liability, and hormonal effects of two prototypic pharmacologic agents were evaluated for the management of chronic myogenous facial pain in a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Thirty-nine subjects (35 women,. 4 men) with daily or near-daily orofacial pain of at least 3 months' duration and tenderness to palpation of masticatory muscles participated. Patients were randomly allocated to one of four treatments: placebo, diazepam, ibuprofen, or the combination of diazepam and ibuprofen. Pain, mood, muscle tenderness, maximal interincisal opening, and plasma levels of beta-endorphin were measured following 2-week baseline and 4-week treatment periods. Pain, as measured by a visual analog scale, was significantly decreased in the diazepam and diazepam plus ibuprofen groups but not for the ibuprofen or placebo groups. Analysis of variance showed a significant drug effect for diazepam but not for ibuprofen, indicating that pain relief was attributable to diazepam. No significant changes were noted in muscle tenderness, interincisal opening, or plasma beta-endorphin level. This study supports the efficacy of diazepam in the short-term management of chronic orofacial muscle pain. The lack of effect following administration of an anti-inflammatory analgesic suggests that inflammation is not the basis for chronic muscle pain in the orofacial region, and that the analgesic effect of such medications is not sufficient for pain relief in this condition.", 
    "112": "Oral drug abuse is a major social and medical issue. Paisley, in the West of Scotland, has become infamous for its problem with oral temazepam abuse. With the crack down on the prescription of temazepam in our area and the resultant lack of its supply on the streets, drug abusers appear to be experimenting with new drugs for their psychotropic effects. We report five cases of recreational carbamazepine overdosage in young temazepam abusers.", 
    "113": "A combination of 0.35 mg/kg midazolam and 5 mg/kg ketamine, administered orally for pediatric sedation, resulted in a severe decreases in blood oxygen saturation postoperatively. The patient, a 2-yr-old child, did not respond to command or mild physical stimulation in the recovery room 60 min after receiving the drugs. The benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (0.01 mg/kg), was administered intravenously to reverse the action of midazolam. No adverse effects were observed thereafter, and the postoperative recovery was uneventful. Combining different classes of drugs may result in less variability in patients response, but there is a greater potential for drug-induced side effects and drug interactions.", 
    "114": "The objective of this work is to identify the degree of preoperatory anxiety which patients who must undergo cardiac surgery present, and evaluate the influence of sedation with Propofol or Midazolam in the appearance of anxiety in the immediate and late postoperatory. The study population was formed by 22 patients, being appointed at random to receive Propofol or Midazolam in infusions. We used the scale of Max Hamilton in three consecutive stages (preoperatory, post-extubation, and pre-discharge) to measure the level of anxiety. Both groups were similar according to their distribution in sex, age, weight, conscience level and severity level at entrance. The patients who were sedated with propofol showed a level of postoperatory anxiety significatively lower than those patients who were treated with midazolam (p < 0.05). To conclude, we believe that the type of sedative used has a significant influence in the development of post-operatory anxiety.", 
    "115": "The presence of increased amount of ligands for benzodiazepine receptors has been demonstrated in cirrhotic patients. Evoked potentials (EP) recordings are a simple, suitable, and objective method for comprehensive evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We evaluated the visual EP, brain stem auditory EP, and somatosensory EP (SSEP) and the effect of benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil in patients with liver cirrhosis. EP of 38 patients with liver cirrhosis were recorded on the electrodiagnostic system Neuropack 8 (JB-441 B, Nihon Kohden). Eleven patients (nine males and two females; mean age 60 years; six with stage 0,4 with stage one, and one with stage 2 HE) showed impairment in SSEP N13-N19 interval. After baseline period, boluses of 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg flumazenil were injected every thirty minutes and SSEP recordings were repeated after every dosage. We did not find any difference before and after flumazenil in SSEP N13-N19 interval (7.3 +/- 0.4, 7.1 +/- 0.5, 7.1 +/- 0.4, and 7.1 +/- 0.6 minutes, respectively) (p < 0.05). But four patients (36%) showed a clear SSEP improvement with flumazenil. Our results suggest that in a subset of cirrhotic patients, flumazenil may have a role.", 
    "116": "The aim of this study was to compare prospectively haematoma blocks alone and haematoma blocks with sedation with general anaesthesia for the reduction of distal radius fractures in adult patients, with respect to pain perception before, during and after manipulation using a visual analogue scale, radiological position, waiting time, procedure time and cost. Fifty-eight adult patients with closed, displaced distal radius fractures were included in the study. Pain experienced during manipulation was greatest in patients who received haematoma blocks alone compared with the other two groups. Post-manipulation pain was significantly greater in patients who received a general anaesthetic. Radiological correction was as good in those patients receiving a haematoma block with or without sedation as a general anaesthetic. The waiting and manipulation times and resource costs were greater in those receiving a general anaesthetic. There were no complications related to any of these anaesthetic methods. Patient acceptance is greater with a correctly performed haematoma block and sedation technique compared to general anesthesia. It is also more efficient with regard to time and the resources required. This is particularly important for a progressively increasing ambulatory, elderly population who require prompt, safe, effective and painless management.", 
    "117": "This paper describes a new sensitive gas chromatographic method with electron capture detector to assay estazolam in human plasma, which has been developed and validated for pharmacokinetic purposes. The drug and the internal standard (triazolam) were extracted from plasma buffered at pH 9.0 into toluene and analysed on a widebore DB 17 column. The calibration curve covered the 1.0-200 ng ml-1 range with a mean determination coefficient of 0.9996. The quantification limit was 1.0 ng ml-1. This method was used to investigate the bioequivalence of a new formulation of estazolam in drops (test) and the formulation in tablets (reference, ESILGAN). Both formulations were administered at a single dose of 2 mg in a clinical trial carried out on 24 healthy volunteers consisting of 12 males and 12 females, following a crossover randomised design in two periods with wash-out. The test and the reference formulations proved to be fully bioequivalent according to operating guidelines, namely through 90% confidence intervals in the 0.80-1.25 range.", 
    "118": "The paper studies retention parameters of the therapeutically most frequently used benzodiazepines, i.e. diazepam, oxazepam, medazepam, chlorodiazepoxide, and nitrazepam. The effect of the pH of the mobile phase, percentual representation of methanol, character of the used buffer and the addition of hexanesulfonic acid on the retention time, shape and symmetry of the peaks of the drugs under study were examined. The analysis was carried out on a column filled with Separon SGX C 18. The best results were achieved using the mobile phase methanol-phosphate buffer 0.05 mol/l pH 3.00 65:35, detection with a UV detector at a wavelength of 250 nm. The optimized chromatographic conditions were applied to the analysis of benzodiazepines in rabbit plasma samples.", 
    "119": "The aim was to investigate the efficacy and practicability of oral low-dose premedication with 3.75 mg midazolam (1/2 tablet Dormicum 7.5 mg) for selective intraocular surgery with retrobulbar anesthesia. Forty-six ASA II-III patients were randomly assigned to either group I: midazolam (n = 24) or group II: placebo (n = 22). Sedation was objectively quantified with a scale derived from the Glasgow-Coma-Scale and a verbal self-rating scale. Trait-anxiety was studied with the State-Trait Inventory by Spielberger, perioperative situative anxiety with the Erlanger Anxiety Scale. Cardiovascular variables and oxygenation were automatically monitored. Midazolam produced significant and sufficient sedation and significant anxiolysis. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure were moderately but significantly, reduced. The effect on diastolic pressure was more pronounced. There was no effect on heart-rate. Oxygenation at all times remained well above 90% SpO2. In conclusion low-dose oral midazolam proved to be a single and effective premedication before intraocular surgery under local anesthesia.", 
    "120": "This paper offers an analysis of the events surrounding the suspension of the licence for the widely used sleeping tablet Halcion (triazolam) by the British Licensing Authority in October 1991. It is argued that these events highlight a growing crisis in modern medical treatments and in the social relations of health care. This is illustrated by focusing on four elements which have contributed to Halcion becoming a public issue and to its suspension and subsequent banning, namely the claims-making activities of medical experts, the development of legal challenges to medicine, the role of the media and the response of the state.", 
    "121": "The outcome of the drug approval process plays a major role in determining how drugs will be prescribed in Canada. The objective of this paper is to examine the nature of the regulatory approval process, its decisions, how these are expressed in pharmaceutical promotion and the ultimate impact of these factors on the prescribing of psychotropic drugs in general and particularly with regard to the benzodiazepines. There is strong circumstantial evidence that the benzodiazepines were approved on the basis of inadequate clinical trials resulting in these drugs being indicated for conditions for which they were not useful and significant safety issues being ignored. These deficiencies in the regulatory process were magnified in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for psychosocial problems, overprescribing for somatic complaints, overprescribing to women and overprescribing for anxiety disorders. Problems in the approval process continue to exist and these will manifest themselves in ongoing inappropriate prescribing of psychotropic, and other, medications.", 
    "122": "The effect of storage on the physical stability of solid dispersions of triamterene or temazepam in polyethylene glycols was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), particle-size analysis and dissolution methods. The enthalpies of fusion of the carriers, without included drug and previously fused and crystallized, increased on storage. Analysis of similarly treated solid dispersions, containing either 10% temazepam or 10% triamterene, showed that each drug influenced the morphology of the polyethylene glycol (PEG). The enthalpies and melting points of the solidus components of the dispersions' carriers were initially reduced after preparation, but on storage these increased. The particle sizes of the drugs dispersed in the PEGs increased on storage. The changes in dissolution after storage of triamterene or temazepam dispersions were smaller for dispersions in PEG 1500 than for dispersions in PEGs of higher molecular weight (PEG 2000, PEG 4000 or PEG 6000) in which the reduction in dissolution was particularly marked during the first month of storage. The rank order of changes in dissolution were PEG 1500 < < PEG 2000 < PEG 4000 approximately PEG 6000."
