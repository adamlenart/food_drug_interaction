The method was developed using cultured fibroblast and urinary cells from fra(X) patients. Prenatal studies were performed on cultured amniotic fluid cells in five pregnancies at risk for fra(X). In two cases the cultured cells showed a 46,XY, fra(X) karyotype. One of the pregnancies was terminated and the diagnosis was confirmed by chromosome studies on several fetal tissues including chorionic villi and by histopathologic changes in the lymphatic vessels of the fetal testes. The fra(X) was also demonstrated in chorionic villi in a case in which amniotic fluid cells were not studied. Chorionic villi were isolated after a spontaneous abortion, the cultured cells had a 45,X karyotype and in addition 5% of the cells were fra(X) positive.", 
    "1": "The effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), citalopram, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), cyproheptadine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), metitepine and NSD 1034 on nitrazepam-induced sleep were investigated in mice. Nitrazepam (1.6-25.6 mg kg-1, i.p.) induced a dose-dependent sedative-hypnotic effect. 5-HTP (8-128 mg kg-1 i.m.) did not induce behavioural sleep but sedated mice and significantly potentiated nitrazepam-induced sleep. Similarly, 5-HTP (4-32 mg kg-1, i.m.) increased pentobarbitone sleeping time. Citalopram (2.5-10 mg kg-1, i.p.) significantly potentiated nitrazepam sleep. PCPA (300-400 mg kg-1, i.p.) completely abolished nitrazepam sleep; 5-HTP (32 mg kg-1, i.m.) reversed this effect. NSD 1034 (75-150 mg kg-1, i.p.) antagonized the potentiating effect of 5-HTP (32 mg kg-1, i.m.) on nitrazepam sleep. Cyproheptadine (5-10 mg kg-1, i.p.) and LSD-25 (2.5-10 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) partially antagonized nitrazepam sleep. Similarly, 5-HTP-induced potentiation of nitrazepam sleep was antagonized by cyproheptadine and LSD-25. Metitepine (4-8 mg kg-1, i.p.) induced behavioural sleep and significantly potentiated nitrazepam sleep. Ro15-1788 (10 mg kg-1, i.p.) effectively antagonized nitrazepam-induced sleep. These results indicate that enhancement of central 5-HT neurotransmission may underlie nitrazepam-induced sleep in mice.", 
    "2": "The effect of two benzodiazepines, midazolam and diazepam, was studied in guinea-pig myenteric neurones, using intracellular recording techniques. Both these benzodiazepines (100-300 pM) potentiated the rapidly desensitizing, bicuculline-sensitive depolarization, induced by alpha-aminobutyrate ionophoresis. Concentrations of midazolam and diazepam higher than 100 nM depressed the gamma-aminobutyrate-induced depolarization. The potentiating effect of the benzodiazepines was reversibly abolished by Ro 15-1788 (1-100 nM) and by pentylenetetrazol (100 microM). A second effect of midazolam and diazepam (100-300 pM) was a reversible depression of the amplitude and duration of the directly evoked action potential in 29% of neurones, without affecting membrane potential or conductance. The effect was very marked when electrodes were filled with CsCl, and was also seen in the presence of tetrodotoxin. In some but not all of these neurones, the amplitude and duration of the action potentials was reduced also by gamma-aminobutyrate (1-10 microM). Ro 15-1788 and pentylenetetrazol reversibly abolished the effect of benzodiazepines on the action potential, but not that of gamma-aminobutyrate. Thus, benzodiazepines have two effects on myenteric neurones. The first is an enhancement of the gamma-aminobutyrate response (activation of Cl conductance); the second is a depression of the calcium action potential, which appears to be independent of gamma-aminobutyrate.", 
    "3": "The subcutaneous injection of the methylxanthine derivative pentoxifylline (3,7, dimethyl-1-(5-oxo-hexyl)-xanthine) was able to induce, 3 h later, a significant reduction of benzodiazepine binding sites in rat cerebral cortex. When tested in vitro, pentoxifylline displaced 3H-flunitrazepam from specific binding sites in a competitive manner. For this effect pentoxifylline was about 10 times more potent than caffeine. When given in two daily injections for 5 days, pentoxifylline brought about a significant elevation in the number of cortical benzodiazepine binding sites. Neither acute nor chronic pentoxifylline treatment modified cortical muscarinic cholinergic binding sites. Pentoxifylline has negligible affinity for cortical muscarinic receptors in vitro. These results suggest that pentoxifylline is able to affect the cortical benzodiazepine receptors differentially, depending on time of drug administration.", 
    "4": "This paper presents a review of literature data and results from investigations designed to determine the relation between structure, affinity to benzodiazepine receptors and pharmacological activity of possible endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine receptors and their electronic structural analogs. Structural variations of endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine receptors are substantiated to manifest themselves as active psychotropic drugs. On the basis of these considerations and experimental data, compounds with psychotropic activity and electronic structure, resembling that of \"endogenous ligands\" of benzodiazepine receptors, were developed.", 
    "5": "The biodistribution of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in control and stress-loaded mice (forced swimming) was compared. In control mice, carrier-free [3H]Ro 15-1788 was selectively and highly distributed in Bz receptor rich brain regions, while radioactivity in the brain was very low following administration of carrier-added tracer, which suggested that in vivo non-specific binding of this tracer was very low. Significant changes in biodistribution of carrier-free [3H]Ro 15-1788 were observed in stress-loaded mice, which strongly indicated that in vivo binding availability of Bz receptor in the brain was rapidly and reversibly reduced by acute stress. The degree of these changes was very dependent upon the stressful conditions, such as swimming duration and water temperature, and a significant alteration in biodistribution of [3H]Ro 15-1788 was particularly observed in the cerebral cortex. Simplified Scatchard analysis of in vivo binding of this tracer was performed, and results suggested that these alterations were mainly caused by changes in the Kd value rather than the Bmax value.", 
    "6": "Benzodiazepines bind to high affinity binding sites in brain and other tissues. One of the high affinity sites in brain possesses properties which make it a likely site of action for these drugs. Binding to the benzodiazepine receptor is saturable and stereospecific; a high degree of correlation can be made between binding to this site and the pharmacological potency of the benzodiazepines. Binding to the site is also enchanced in the presence of GABA, the brain's major inhibitory transmitter. Because of this allosteric activation of benzodiazepine binding and the known electrophysiological interactions of the benzodiazepines with GABA, it appears likely that the site of action of the benzodiazepines in the brain is a GABA receptor complex. Recent evidence indicates that this complex also contains an anion channel which is the site of action of some of the barbiturates and known cage convulsants. The purification of the proteins composing this complex has been carried out and the major proteins appear to be several proteins with molecular weights between 50-60 k daltons; some higher molecular weight subunits may also be present. The benzodiazepine receptor protein can be labeled with 3H-flunitrazepam which labels a protein of molecular weight about 50 k daltons. Proteolytic degradation of the photolabeled benzodiazepine receptor results in the formation of several peptides and one limiting peptide which has recently been purified. Knowledge of its structure should yield interesting information about the origins of the benzodiazepine receptor and provide a useful tool for further molecular studies.", 
    "7": "Male Wistar rats were chronically treated with 2 mg/kg per day bicuculline i.p. during 10 days. Biochemical parameters related to the GABAergic system in CNS were analyzed. A 63% increase in glutamic acid decarboxylase activity was found in treated animals. Endogenous GABA levels were not modified. The treatment increased Bmax of GABA binding by 112% without changing the KD value. The treatment decreased Bmax of diazepam binding by 40% whereas it did not change the KD value. Diazepam binding was enhanced by in vitro addition of GABA at the same extent as in treated animals.", 
    "8": "The influence of the nootropic drug piracetam (Normabrain) on specific ligand binding to several neurotransmitter and drug receptors was investigated using established receptor binding procedures. Even at concentrations of 20 mmol/l of piracetam no or only marginal inhibition was observed for the dopamine- and muscarinic cholinergic receptors and for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site, while for the benzodiazepine receptor, the GABA receptor, the opiate receptor, and the serotonin receptor half-maximal inhibitory concentrations between 20 and 50 mmol/l could be determined. In contrast to these effects seen only at relatively high piracetam concentrations, piracetam is considerably more active at the L-glutamate receptor with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of about 1 mmol/l. This relatively specific effect of piracetam at the L-glutamate receptor could also take place under therapeutic conditions in vivo, since brain levels of piracetam in man may range between 0.1 and 1 mmol/l. It is concluded that effects within the glutaminergic system of the brain could contribute to the therapeutical effects of piracetam in man.", 
    "9": "The antipunishment properties of diazepam (DZP) were investigated in mice treated acutely, or following nine daily treatments with either DZP (5 mg/kg, PO) or its vehicle. Acutely, or following chronic vehicle treatment, DZP produced a dose-related increase in activity punished by footshock. Following chronic DZP, test doses of DZP given 24 or 48 h following the last chronic treatment were no longer, or less effective in enhancing punished activity. Effects on unpunished activity were unaffected. In a study of the time course of tolerance development, tolerance was not seen after one or three daily treatments but was present after 6 days. Following establishment of tolerance by 9 days' treatment, the antipunishment activity of DZP reappeared after 8 days' withdrawal and was restored to acute levels after 16 days. Tolerance was not associated with changes in benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor affinity or numbers, but the ability of GABA to enhance BZ binding was increased. There was no change in the ability of DZP or the convulsant beta-carboline DMCM to modulate 35S-TBPS binding. The mechanism of tolerance to the antipunishment properties of DZP therefore remains unknown.", 
    "10": "An endogenous brain ligand which competes with 3H-flunitrazepine for the binding to benzodiazepine receptor has been isolated and purified to homogeneity. The purification procedures involve the liberation of the ligand into the high speed supernatant followed by ultrafiltration through a PM10 membrane (exclusion limit: 10,000-dalton) column chromatographies on Sephadex G-50, Bio-Rad P2 and finally with three times reversed phase HPLC using C18 columns. The purified endogenous ligand is heat stable, insensitive to DNAase or RNAase and contains about 5-10% amino acid residues. It has an absorption maximum at 220 nm and a minor peak at 313 nm. The exact chemical structure is unknown.", 
    "11": "Human and rat brain contain a neuropeptide with 105 amino acid residues which inhibits the binding of 3H-diazepam and other specific benzodiazepine recognition site ligands to crude brain synaptic membranes. DBI injected intracerebroventricularly in thirsty rats which are subjected to a conflict test (Corda et al., 1983), lowers the threshold for behavioral suppression by punishment. In this test DBI acts like an anxiogenic endocoid for the benzodiazepine recognition sites. The large abundance of lysine and arginine residues in the DBI molecule suggest that this polypeptide functions as a precursor of a putative endocoid which regulates anxiety levels. This endocoid acts as an agonist for the benzodiazepine recognition site. Because of the anxiogenic properties of this endocoid, it is proposed that anxiolytic benzodiazepine should be classified as an antagonist and beta-carboline as an agonist at the receptor level.", 
    "12": "Tribulin is a low molecular weight inhibitor both of monoamine oxidase and of benzodiazepine receptor binding. It has been highly purified from human urine and has also been isolated from human plasma and animal brain. Its structure is still unknown but its properties do not appear to correspond with any known monoamine or benzodiazepine receptor binding inhibitor. Tribulin output has been found to be increased in a variety of states associated with stress and anxiety, including lactate-induced panic attacks, alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal and generalized anxiety disorder.", 
    "13": "Previous studies have shown that Ro 5-4864 is a potent convulsant. Investigation of a series of compounds structurally related to Ro-4864 revealed a good correlation (r = .93, p less than 0.01) between their potencies as convulsants and their abilities to displace [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate from sites associated with the chloride ionophore. In contrast, there appears to be no direct relationship between the convulsant potencies of these compounds and their affinities for \"peripheral-type\" binding sites for benzodiazepines. These data suggest that \"peripheral-type\" binding sites for benzodiazepines are not directly involved in the convulsant actions of Ro 5-4864 and related compounds nonetheless, several lines of evidence suggest that \"peripheral-type\" binding sites for benzodiazepines may be indirectly involved in the convulsant properties of Ro 5-4864.", 
    "14": "RO5-4864 decreased in a dose-dependent manner the duration of intra cellular action potential and the contractility in the guinea pig papillary muscle. Diazepam was less active and clonazepam inactive. The effects of RO5-4864 were blocked by PK 11195 but not by RO15-1788. These results indicate that peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites are pharmacological receptors. PK 11195 antagonized the increase and the decrease in the duration of intracellular action potential induced by BAY K-8644 and calcium channel blockers (nitrendipine, diltiazem, verapamil) respectively but not the increase induced by tetraethylammonium which blocks potassium channel. Moreover the decrease in contractility provoked by RO5-4864 was antagonized by 4 mM Ca2+. Thus peripheral type BZ receptors are coupled with Ca2+ channels in the heart.", 
    "15": "Recent observations have shown that \"peripheral-type\" binding sites for benzodiazepines (PBS) are under neural and/or hormonal control in the pineal gland, olfactory bulb, and kidney. These studies resulted in a search for endogenous substances which might physiologically subserve PBS. Acidified methanol or trichloroacetic acid extraction of both peripheral tissues and brain followed by ultrafiltration and/or gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of both high (Mr greater than 10,000) and low (Mr less than 500) molecular weight substances which inhibit the binding of [3H] Ro 5-4864 to PBS while only slightly inhibiting the binding of [3H] diazepam to classical \"brain-type\" benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "16": "The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 was labelled with [11C] and examined for possible use as ligand for PET scan studies on benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys and human subjects. [11C] Ro 15-1788 allowed the in vivo visualization of benzodiazepine receptor binding in cerebral and cerebellar cortical areas as well as in basal brain nuclei in PET scan images. [11C] Ro 15-1788 exhibited a high ratio of specific benzodiazepine receptor binding (cerebral cortex) to non-specific binding (pons) and the kinetics of binding should be satisfactory for quantitative clinical PET scan studies using [11C]. The in vivo binding of [11C] Ro 15-1788 in the cerebral cortex of cynomolgus monkeys and healthy human subjects was reduced by approximately 90% within 10 min after the intravenous injection of a high dose of unlabelled Ro 15-1788 (0.5 mg/kg i.v.). Different areas of the healthy human brain showed an approximately 10-fold variation in maximal [11C] Ro 15-1788 binding that corresponded to the previously known distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in these regions. The highest degree of binding was obtained in the medial occipital cerebral cortex followed by frontal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, striatum and pons. Two psychiatric patients with anxiety syndromes who had been treated for a long time with high doses of benzodiazepines had roughly the same degree of maximal [11C] Ro 15-1788 binding in brain regions as the healthy subjects but the rate of decline of [11C] Ro 15-1788 in the brain was higher. This indicates that there is measurable competition between [11C] Ro 15-1788 binding and clinical benzodiazepine concentrations in the body fluids of psychiatric patients. The results demonstrate that [11C] Ro 15-1788 should be a valuable tool for quantitative analyses of benzodiazepine receptor characteristics and receptor occupancy in the brain of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "17": "Several lines of evidence from reversible binding studies seem to indicate there are at least two \"central\" benzodiazepine receptor subtypes, the BZ1 and BZ2 receptors. Irreversible binding studies, using 3H-flunitrazepam as a photoaffinity label for benzodiazepine receptors, not only are in perfect agreement with the data from reversible binding studies but extend these studies by identifying P51, a protein with apparent molecular weight 51,000, as a protein associated with the BZ1 receptor and by suggesting that the BZ2 receptor might actually consist of several different benzodiazepine receptors associated with different and distinct proteins irreversibly labeled by 3H-flunitrazepam. Other reversible binding studies have accumulated indicating the existence of several different conformations of benzodiazepine receptors. Irreversible binding studies support this conclusion and in addition suggest the existence of four different benzodiazepine binding sites within the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. It is therefore hypothesized that there are several different GABA-benzodiazepine receptor subtypes all of which have four distinct benzodiazepine binding sites which can exist in at least three different but freely interconvertible conformations. This hypothesis can account for all experimental observations obtained so far and might partially explain the distinct clinical effects of structurally similar benzodiazepines.", 
    "18": "A new approach to pathogenetic study of hepatic encephalopathy was recently undertaken in order to identify the neurological alterations of the brain which characterize the coma. In this study attention was firstly addressed to a correct and objective evaluation of the comatose state in rats with fulminant hepatic failure induced by galactosamine. For this purpose visual evoked potentials were utilized since this electrophysiological test proved reliable and sensitive on the basis of an extensive pharmacological study. Two different stages of coma were identified in the rat and they were named mild and severe. Receptor binding studies performed on brain membranes of these rats show in the mild stage an increased number of low and high affinity GABA receptors and a decreased affinity of dopamine receptors. The severe stage is characterized by the persistence of only high affinity GABA receptors and a reduced number of dopamine receptors. This imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory receptor systems may explain the generalized central nervous system depression which characterizes the hepatic encephalopathy while the increased number of benzodiazepine receptors found in both stages of coma may account for the brain supersensitivity to sedative administration of patients with liver disease and for the sedative-induced episodes of coma. These receptor alterations may be attributed to a disuse and/or a partial degeneration of nerve terminals due to peripheral neurotoxins (i.e., ammonia, mercaptans, short chain fatty acids) and the decrease of glutamate decarboxylase activity and of zinc levels in brain tissues seems to be respectively a direct and an indirect demonstration of this phenomenon. Bearing in mind the supersensitivity of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor system and their reciprocal interaction, a benzodiazepine antagonist was administered to rats in mild stage of encephalopathy. Electrophysiological and benzodiazepine binding studies demonstrated that this treatment can temporarily counteract some of the neurological disturbances of the earlier stage of coma and act as antidote of the sedative-induced episodes of coma.", 
    "19": "Cyclopeptine synthetase, the key enzyme of benzodiazepine alkaloid biosynthesis in Penicillium cyclopium forms cyclo-(anthranoyl-phenylalanyl) from anthranilic acid, L-phenylalanine, the methyl group of L-methionine and ATP. The following in vitro measurable partial activities of the enzyme system were followed during the development of P. cyclopium: anthranilic acid and L-phenylalanine adenylyltransferase activities, and the ability for thioester-binding of L-phenylalanine to the enzyme protein. These activities became measurable at the beginning of the idiophase and reached a maximum 6 days after inoculation, i.e., the pattern of activity was similar to that of the other enzymes participating in the biosynthesis of the benzodiazepine alkaloids indicating that the activities of all enzymes of the pathway were coordinatedly expressed. Inhibitor experiments indicated that 48-55 h after inoculation a preprotein of anthranilic acid adenylyltransferase was formed, which later on became activated by a hitherto unknown mechanism.", 
    "20": "Rats implanted with amygdaloid stimulating and cortical recording electrodes were kindled by daily low-intensity electrical stimulation. In one experiment amino acid concentrations were measured in amygdala, cortex and hippocampus at behavioural stages 1, 2 and 4 (Racine). Control groups consisted of unstimulated rats. Only alanine showed a significant enhancement of concentration in the kindled rats (stage 4 of Racine). In a second experiment, a group of rats was treated daily with 10mg/kg p.o. of diazepam. Diazepam significantly inhibited kindling and no changes in amino acid concentrations were observed in this group. Increased alanine levels are seen after various seizure types; since pentetrazole, isoniazid and beta-vinyllactic acid seizures were associated with alanine level increases only after and never before seizure occurrence, it is suggested that the alanine increases are a consequence rather than a cause of convulsions. In 3H-flunitrazepam binding studies, no change in affinity or receptor number could be demonstrated during kindling.", 
    "21": "Non-deprived rats were familiarized with a highly palatable diet until baseline consumption in a 60-min daily access period had stabilised. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (1.25-10.0 mg/kg, IP) produced a large, dose-related increase in food consumption during the first 30 min of access. It also produced significant, short-term hyperphagia in animals which had been partially pre-satiated on the diet before drug administration, an effect which was reversible by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15-1788. Administered alone, Ro15-1788 (1.25-10.0 mg/kg, IP) had no intrinsic activity in the food consumption test. In contrast, CGS 8216 (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, IP) produced a marked dose-related suppression of food intake. This anorectic effect was shared by two benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists, FG 7142 and DMCM, which also produced dose-dependent reductions in consumption. The effects on feeding produced by FG 7142 (20 mg/kg, IP) and DMCM (1.25 mg/kg, IP) were reversed by either Ro15-1788 (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) or midazolam (5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg). A matched anorectic effect produced by CGS 8216 (40 mg/kg) was not, however, reversed by either Ro15-1788 or midazolam. This suggests that at a high dose CGS 8216 may act by a mechanism different from that of the two inverse agonists. The feeding test described in the report proved sensitive to both hyperphagic and anorectic effects of drugs active at benzodiazepine receptors, pointing to a possible bi-directional control of palatable food consumption.", 
    "22": "Mother rats nursing large litters are hyperphagic, aggressive towards conspecifics, and show less freezing behaviour than non-maternal animals. These naturally occurring adaptations resemble those elicited by benzodiazepine treatment in virgin rats, indicating a common neurochemical change in the brains of mother rats and benzodiazepine-treated virgins. In line with this hypothesis, it was found that three functional benzodiazepine antagonists (FG 7142, pentylenetetrazol, caffeine) decreased food intake, lowered aggression and strengthened freezing in lactating mother rats. These psychopharmacological observations support the idea that GABA neurotransmission is enhanced during motherhood in the rat.", 
    "23": "The effects of valproate (30-500 mg/kg), alone and in combination with picrotoxin (1.5 mg/kg) or RO 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) were studied in two experiments on hyponeophagia in rats. Valproate reduced eating latency and increased eating time and amount eaten of novel food, except at 500 mg/kg which reduced feeding. Picrotoxin induced generally opposite actions alone and shifted valproate dose/response curves to the right. RO 15-1788 had no detectable intrinsic action, but prevented both the behavioural facilitation and inhibition produced by valproate. These findings are discussed in the context of the GABA hypothesis of benzodiazepine action, with the conclusions that they provide behavioural support for the hypothesis of a receptor complex with GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites, and that an optimal and submaximal level of activity at the benzodiazepine site is a necessary condition for anxiolytic actions of valproate.", 
    "24": "Administration to mice of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) five times over 10 days results in an enhanced 5-HTP-induced head twitch response, an enhanced apomorphine-induced locomotor response and an attenuated sedation response to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine. Diazepam (1.25 mg/kg IP) injected 5 min before each ECS abolished the enhanced 5-HT- and dopamine-mediated responses but left the attenuated sedation response unaltered. When diazepam was given 5 min after each convulsion it still had the same effect, although its effects on the ECS-induced changes was blocked by administration of the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg IP) at the same time as diazepam. It is concluded that diazepam can abolish the ECS-induced changes in 5-HT- and DA-mediated behaviour, but not alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, possibly by interfering with post-ictal changes. The implications for administration of benzodiazepines during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are discussed.", 
    "25": "The beta-carbolines, which are potent ligands for benzodiazepine receptors, antagonize the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines. In the cat, the stable beta-carboline derivative methylamide-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, FG 7142, and the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 reversed behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes produced by a single dose of diazepam. Surprisingly, the beta-carboline did not elicit signs of withdrawal when given after 22 days of a daily dose regimen of diazepam, while Ro 15-1788 precipitated an acute abstinence syndrome largely characterized by tremors, increased muscle tone, back arching, myoclonic jerks and pupil dilatation. Unlike Ro 15-1788, the beta-carboline produced effects of its own such as behavioral states of arousal and fearfulness. These findings indicate that the beta-carboline functionally interacts with benzodiazepine receptors in a manner unlike that seen with typical agonists and antagonists.", 
    "26": "The French technique of anaesthesia by electrostimulation described in 1972 by Cara and coworkers, consists of transcranial electrostimulation by means of a high frequency current combined with administration of a neuroleptic drug, a benzodiazepine, a curare and nitrous oxide with oxygen. Fentanyl is also given by some authors. In order to assess the benefit of such electrostimulation, this study compared two randomized groups of ten patients, scheduled for abdominal and pelvic surgery. Both groups received the same drugs (i.e. droperidol, flunitrazepam, pancuronium and nitrous oxide with oxygen), whereas patients in group I were also submitted to electrostimulation. This study describes and discusses the clinical behaviour of patients and the hormonal reactions before, during and after surgery. In both groups, operative conditions were satisfactory. Recovery and onset of spontaneous ventilation were rapid and no patient had an unpleasant recall of the operation itself. However, most of them complained of postoperative pain. Electrostimulation did not reduce the quantity of drugs required during and after surgery. In both groups, circulatory activity was significantly increased. In group I, the arterial pressure and the heart rate were significantly higher than in group II during and after surgery. The hormonal reactions showed that in both groups adrenocorticotrophic hormone, growth hormone and antidiuretic hormone increased during surgery. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone concentration was higher in group I during the operation. The serum levels of cortisol decreased before surgery in group I and rose in both groups during and after laparotomy; prolactin increased before surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Saturable binding site for 3H-flunitrazepam (KD = 43 +/- 7 nM, Bmax = 391 +/- 58 fmoles/cell, i.e. 250,000 sites/cell) is characterized on Mouse peritoneal inflammatory macrophages. The affinity for different ligands (PK 11195 greater than Ro 5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than flunitrazepam greater than clonazepam greater than Ro 15-1788) shows that this site is of peripheral type. In vivo the humoral response in Mice to Sheep red blood cells was stimulated by administration of 1 mg/kg of PK 11195 (+85%), Ro 5-4864 (+80%) and diazepam (+58%). Clonazepam and Ro 15-1788 are devoid of activity. This suggests that molecules which show affinity for the \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding site might modulate the immune response.", 
    "28": "Effects of calcium hopantenate (HOPA) on neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) were investigated. In the radioreceptor assay (RRA), HOPA inhibited the [3H]-gamma-aminobutylic acid (GABA) receptor binding in a dose-dependent manner with a cross-reactive potency of 0.2%. On the other hand, radiolabeled ligand binding to CNS receptors in the benzodiazepine (BDZ)-, muscarinic cholinergic (mACh)-, methionine-enkephalin (ENK)- and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)-RRA systems was not inhibited even by the addition of HOPA up to 100 microM. Repeated injection of HOPA (250 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days) increased GABA receptor binding by 53% in the cerebral cortex, while GABA binding in the rest of the forebrain did not change. The increased GABA receptor binding in the cerebral cortex of HOPA treated rats was due to the increased affinity of the binding sites. BDZ-, mACh-, ENK- and TRH-receptor bindings were not affected in either the cerebral cortex or the rest of the forebrain by repeated injection of HOPA. These results suggest that at least a part of the therapeutic efficacy of HOPA is due to sensitization of the GABA receptor in the cerebral cortex.", 
    "29": "The triazolobenzodiazepine, alprazolam, was administered to 11 depressed patients over a period of six weeks, and six patients showed a favorable antidepressant response. There were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders in age, pretreatment Hamilton Depression Rating Scores, 4 p.m. postdexamethasone plasma cortisol levels, or platelet monoamine oxidase activities. Blood levels of alprazolam were not meaningfully different in responders and nonresponders when measured on treatment day 8. However, on treatment day 8, significantly enhanced prostaglandin D2-stimulated platelet adenylate cyclase activity, greater suppression of prostaglandin D2-stimulated platelet adenylate cyclase activity by epinephrine, and enhanced sodium fluoride-stimulated platelet adenylate cyclase activity were seen in the six patients who went on to respond to alprazolam, but not in the five nonresponders. In contrast, there were no significant changes in prostaglandin D2, (-)-isoproterenol, or fluoride ion-stimulated leukocyte adenylate cyclase activity in responders or nonresponders. No meaningful changes were observed in the mean densities of either the high-affinity platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (for 3H-p-aminoclonidine) or the leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor (for 3H-dihydroalprenolol) in responders or nonresponders. The present findings, taken in conjunction with findings from other recent studies, suggest that enhanced coupling between certain neurotransmitter or hormone receptors and adenylate cyclase through the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins may help explain the antidepressant effects of alprazolam and possibly other forms of antidepressant treatment.", 
    "30": "Octanol/aqueous buffer solvent distribution ratio and liquid chromatographic retention in a primarily aqueous phase were determined and correlated to estimated substituent Hansch pi values for a series of 1-methyl-isoguanines. Substituent connectivity values (simple, valence, and bond length) were also computed and factored into the correlation equation between known in vitro activity data and these lipophilic parameters. The liquid chromatographic retention data were best correlated with measured activity accounting for 61% of the variation while distribution ratio and Hansch pi accounted for 56% or 52%, respectively, when each was considered alone. Valence connectivity accounted for 30% of the variation alone but did not add significantly to the equations when factored with the other parameters.", 
    "31": "Initially low level of motor search activity in test situations (\"open field\", maze) in rats previously grouped according to their passive behaviour with a partner-victim (Simonov method), does not essentially change after 3-week administration of phenazepam; the activity level of cytochrome oxidase in the cortex and hypothalamus is lowered. Phenazepam administration in conditions of prolonged unavoidable painful stimulation brings to a sharp increase of motor search activity and aggressive behaviour. Simultaneously the cytochrome oxidase activity increases in the same way as during a stress without phenazepam. This fact points to the independence of behavioural and biochemical effects in this case.", 
    "32": "Denzimol, a new anticonvulsant drug, enhances the depressant and antimetrazol activities of diazepam in mice, in a dose and time-dependent fashion. The depressant and anticonvulsant activities of phenobarbital were not affected by Denzimol. It is suggested that Denzimol induces an increase in the number of the benzodiazepine receptors, and that such increase might be responsible for the enhancement of the diazepam's activities.", 
    "33": "RO 5-4864 (20 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine with high affinity for peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in rat kidney and brain, but not for the \"classical\" CNS sites, reduced the time spent by pairs of rats in active social interaction, without reducing locomotor activity, possibly reflecting an anxiogenic action. This anxiogenic effect was not reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 or 10 mg/kg) given acutely, but was reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) given for 5 days prior to testing. RO 15-1788 (10 mg/kg), a drug that antagonises several effects of benzodiazepines but has little affinity for peripheral-type sites, had no action on the reduction in social interaction induced by RO 5-4864. However, CGS 8216 (10 mg/kg) which also antagonises the effects of benzodiazepines and has little affinity for RO 5-4864 recognition sites, significantly enhanced the reduction in social interaction caused by RO 5-4864, and the combination produced a significant decrease in locomotor activity. These results are discussed in terms of possible sites of action of RO 5-4864 on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "34": "In an attempt to identify potential anticonvulsant compounds, 18 structural analogues of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were tested for their ability to inhibit GABA receptor binding, sodium-dependent GABA binding and GABA aminotransferase activity in synaptic membranes from mouse brain. Nine inhibitors of receptor binding were found. The most potent was N-(thiocarbamoyl)glycine (Ki = 18 microM). However, this compound had no real effect on Na+ -dependent GABA binding nor on the activity of GABA aminotransferase. In addition, it was unable to enhance the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam as GABA agonists usually do. This could indicate that this inhibitor is, rather, a GABA receptor antagonist. Even though no particularly potent inhibitors of any of the GABA recognition sites were found, this technique nevertheless demonstrates how simple in vitro assays can be used to find drugs exhibiting potential GABA-mimetic activity.", 
    "35": "The interaction between pentobarbital and other modulators of GABAergic transmission (diazepam, ethanol and progabide) was investigated on maximal electroshock seizures and on the loss of righting reflexes in rats. Pentobarbital, diazepam and ethanol produced a dose-dependent protection against electroshock seizures, with pentobarbital being more potent (3- and 50-times) than diazepam and ethanol. Progabide neither provided protection nor caused loss of righting reflex. Subprotective doses of pentobarbital and diazepam, together or when combined with a single ineffective dose of ethanol or progabide, caused protection against seizures and loss of righting reflex for variable durations, while ethanol and progabide combination did not provide protection. The protective effect of diazepam was antagonized by RO15-1788, picrotoxin and bicuculline pretreatments. The antagonism of pentobarbital protection by a specific GABA receptor antagonist, bicuculline suggests involvement of the GABAergic system in the anticonvulsant effect of pentobarbital. These results indicate that, like diazepam, the anticonvulsant effect of pentobarbital appears to be mediated through a GABAergic mechanism.", 
    "36": "Diazepam effect on paroxysmal electrical activity of an isolated auditory cortex slab and inhibitory responses of its neurons evoked by intracortical electrical stimulation were studied in experiments with cats. Diazepam (2 mg/kg, intravenously) evoked suppression of the paroxysmal electrical activity and increased the number of inhibited neurons both in acute isolated and three-week slabs as compared with the intact cortex. However in this case the number of disynaptic responses decreased, especially in the long-isolated slab. It is supposed that diazepam activated GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons synchronizing inhibition and increasing duration of IPSP. Its action is probably manifested in the first place in the very initial links of cortical neuronal chains.", 
    "37": "A fatal incident during combined anticonvulsive therapy with ACTH and Dexamethason prompted us to reevaluate our treatment results in 19 children suffering from infantile spasms. We followed Doose's recommendation using Clonazepam as a means of first choice. Failing that, than Dexamethason and Primidone was used. A combination of ACTH, Dexamethason and Primidone was administered to patients failing both treatment courses. Our results question the necessity, the tolerance limit and the efficacy of this treatment schedule. Therefore we propose a prospective multicentric study to reinvestigate the therapeutic guideliness for infantile spasms.", 
    "38": "We utilized biochemical and electrophysiological methods to compare the effects of anesthetic and anticonvulsant barbiturates on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-coupled responses. Biochemical analysis involved barbiturate regulation of the affinity of a radiolabeled benzodiazepine for benzodiazepine receptors. The electrophysiological method involved regulation of somatic recurrent inhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampal slice preparation. We found that anesthetic (secobarbital and pentobarbital) but not anticonvulsant (phenobarbital and diphenylbarbituric acid) barbiturates significantly enhanced GABA receptor-coupled responses in both the biochemical and electrophysiological preparations. The results indicate that the anticonvulsant actions of barbiturates may not depend on their ability to enhance GABAergic neuronal activity.", 
    "39": "The inhibition of flunitrazepam (FNP) binding to rat brain benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors by methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (MCC) was studied. Biphasic dissociation was observed for [3H]FNP and [3H]MCC in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, although the dissociation of [3H]MCC was much faster. The dissociation rate of [3H]FNP was increased by MCC in the cerebellum, but was not altered in cerebral cortex or hippocampus. [3H]FNP binding stimulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid was enhanced in the presence of MCC in all three regions examined. These results indicate that MCC exerts these effects by interacting with allosteric sites that are different from the FNP recognition sites on the BZ receptors.", 
    "40": "The effects of guanyl nucleotides on the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to rat hippocampal synaptic membranes were studied. In equilibrium binding studies, gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) increased and GTP decreased the binding affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam; GTP also caused a decrease in binding capacity. The effect, however, is variable. In studies of the dissociation kinetics of [3H]flunitrazepam using diazepam and the antagonist Ro 15-1788 as the displacers, there was evidence of two dissociation rate constants. GTP increased both the fast- and slow-dissociation rate constants and increased the ratio of the slow-dissociation binding state. The effect of GTP was mimicked by its nonhydrolyzable analogue 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate but not by ATP and occurred when diazepam, but not when Ro 15-1788, was used as the displacer. GABA antagonized the effect of GTP on the dissociation of [3H]flunitrazepam. The nature of the benzodiazepine receptor, its actions, and the possible role of cyclic AMP as a second messenger are discussed.", 
    "41": "Specific binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to rat brain membranes (RBM) is enhanced nine-fold by EDTA/water dialysis and 1.3- to 4.2-fold by 50 nM ketosteroid R 5135, or 5 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) or related piperazine-N-alkanesulfonate buffers, or extensive washing with NaCl/Na phosphate or Na phosphate/citrate solution. About one-fifth of the [35S]TBPS binding capacity appears in the soluble fraction whereas the rest remains in particulate form on treatment of the EDTA/water-dialyzed RBM with 20 mM CHAPS. Similar KD values (64-86 nM) are obtained for the original EDTA/water-dialyzed membranes and the CHAPS-treated and/or -solubilized preparations. The Bmax of the EDTA-treated RBM is reduced five-fold on solubilization with CHAPS. The potency for displacement of [35S]TBPS changes in the presence of CHAPS or on CHAPS solubilization: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and muscimol inhibit specific [35S]TBPS binding more strongly in the absence than in the presence of CHAPS: TBPS, picrotoxinin, and photoheptachlor epoxide are almost equally active with RBM, RBM + CHAPS, and RBM solubilized with CHAPS. Levels of (1R, alpha S)-cis-cypermethrin and dimethylbutylbarbiturate which are inhibitory with RBM are moderately stimulatory after TBPS receptor solubilization. Thus CHAPS defines three regions of the GABA receptor-ionophore complex, i.e., the GABA and benzodiazepine receptors, the TBPS/picrotoxinin/polychlorocycloalkane receptor(s), and the sites at which the alpha-cyano pyrethroid and the barbiturate interact with TBPS binding.", 
    "42": "In 3 000g-supernatants of rat pineal homogenates a single population of benzodiazepine (BZP) binding sites with dissociation constant= 97-102 nM and maximal number of sites= 6.5-9 pmoles/mg protein was detected by employing 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZP) as a radioligand. The following order of affinity for several BZP was found (Ki, nM): Ro 5-4864 (8), FNZP (99), clonazepam (7,900) Ro 15-1788 (10,000). Two weeks after bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) a 18-28% reduction of site number without significant changes in affinity of 3H-FNZP binding was detectable in rat pineal glands. In pineal explants priorly incubated with 3H-norepinephrine, exposure to 0.1-10 microM of Ro 5-4864 or diazepam decreased significantly transmitter release elicited by 80 mM K+, whereas clonazepam did not affect it significantly. At 10 microM-concentrations, Ro 5-4864, diazepam or clonazepam increased pineal melatonin content of explants incubated for 6 h with the drug. In pineal explants of rats subjected to SCGx 14 days earlier, only 10 microM of Ro 5-4864 increased melatonin content significantly to about half of the percent increase detected in innervated glands. These results suggest that BZP decrease transmitter release from pineal sympathetic nerves by acting on peripheral BZP binding sites, an effect which is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the postsynaptic stimulation of pineal melatonin synthesis.", 
    "43": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate different treatment schedules in some different types of acne using a quantitative counting technique. Systemic treatment with erythromycine 0.5 g daily and topical treatment with clindamycin phosphate solution 1% was found to be optimal from the efficacy/side effect ratio. The combined treatment was tried in heat-provoked and cosmetic acne with favourable results. Doubling of erythromycine dosage could not prevent premenstrual exacerbation of acne. Diazepam 4 mg daily for two weeks followed by an antihistamine in addition to erythromycine 0.5 g daily gave relatively good results in female patients with acne excori\u00e9. In acne coexisting with pronounced seborrhoic dermatitis of the face the addition of hydrocortisone cream 1% was of benefit, although Roaccutane may here be the drug of choice. In female postpubertal acne, the effect of cyproteronacetate-etynilestradiol (Diane) was not superior to treatment with erythromycine 0.5 g daily. By treating special subtypes differently, one could be able to improve the results of acne therapy.", 
    "44": "The effects of anaesthesia inducing benzodiazepines (diazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam) on serum cortisol level, blood pressure and pulse rate were examined in patients undergoing elective hysterectomy. Diurnal variation of serum cortisol was established two days before operation. Either form of benzodiazepine provided good suppression of the cortisol response to stress during anaesthesia and surgery. The endocrine response to surgical stress was more pronounced at end of the operation in all three groups. Considering the relative changes of cortisol compared to the pre-operative values the smallest differences were seen in the group receiving midazolam. At 6 p.m. on the day of operation the cortisol level decreased in the flunitrazepam and midazolam groups. Especially in the patients who received midazolam at 6 a.m. on the following day the values did not differ from those observed in the control group. On the basis of these examinations it would appear that to prevent adverse stress-induced effects there is a slight advantage in using midazolam for induction of anaesthesia.", 
    "45": "The authors studied the pharmacokinetic behaviour of a new benzodiazepine, midazolam, after a single oral administration in a group of five patients of both sexes, suffering from compensated alcoholic cirrhosis. In this clinical situation both absorption and metabolism rates of the compound were similar to those observed in healthy subjects. The only notable effect, occurring in one severely affected cirrhotic, consisting of prolonged pharmacological activity of the drug.", 
    "46": "A comparison of midazolam (Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) and triazolam was performed with respect to residual effects 7 h after administration. A preliminary study was conducted in 25 trainee pilots attending the Swiss Civil Aviation School, followed by the main study in 105 pilots of the Swissair DC-9 fleet. All subjects were volunteers. Performance was measured in objective terms with the Instrument Coordination Analyser (ICA) which is used for the selection of trainee pilots. The subjects assessed their sleep and condition on waking by means of a questionnaire. In the double-blind trial each subject received either 0.5 mg triazolam or 15 mg midazolam or placebo. The medication was taken at midnight; the test was performed at 7 a.m. The preliminary study was conducted to assess the suitability of the test equipment. Results of the main study: With 15 mg midazolam no residual effects were detectable 7 h after administration (difference from placebo not statistically significant). Triazolam 0.5 mg, on the other hand, produced a statistically significant impairment of performance. The frequency of side effects was significantly greater under triazolam 0.5 mg than under midazolam 15 mg or placebo, whereas there was no difference between midazolam 15 mg and placebo (p = 0.49).", 
    "47": "The combined effect of midazolam (Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) and sleep deprivation on day-time sleep propensity was investigated in young, healthy adults. The oral administration of midazolam (15 mg) or placebo at bedtime was followed either by a sleep period of 7 or 4 h, or by no sleep at all. Sleep propensity was recorded at 2-h intervals throughout the following day by the multiple sleep latency test and self-ratings of tiredness. Performance was assessed in the morning and afternoon by a psychomotor test. Partial and total sleep deprivation caused a marked and significant increase of day-time sleep propensity. However, there was no significant difference between the midazolam and placebo condition after 7 or 4 h of sleep. After total sleep deprivation, sleep propensity was higher after placebo than after midazolam. Neither the treatment nor sleep duration had a significant effect on performance. The results show that a bedtime dose of 15 mg midazolam followed by normal or restricted sleep does not significantly affect day-time alertness.", 
    "48": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam and 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam were investigated following oral administration of 7.5, 15 and 30 mg doses of midazolam in solution to 12 healthy subjects. Compared to the 7.5 mg dose, the Cmax and AUC parameters of both midazolam and 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam increased proportionally after the 15 mg dose and more than proportionally after the 30 mg dose. The t1/2 for midazolam remained relatively constant between the 7.5 and 15 mg doses whereas it increased slightly but significantly after the 30 mg dose. These data indicated that the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam were linear between the 7.5 and 15 mg oral dose range. However, after the 30 mg dose, the systemic availability of midazolam and the AUC for 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam appeared to be greater than that anticipated from the lower doses, possibly due to saturation of midazolam first-pass metabolism. This is not expected to have any clinical significance under the conditions of therapeutic use.", 
    "49": "Chemical agents and drugs of widely differing pharmacological activity have been administered to partially hepatectomized male rats and the extent of liver regeneration ascertained over a period of 10 days. Of the large number investigated, the following fed ad lib in diets supplemented in a basal ration at the weight percentages indicated, proved to be hepatotrophic: anticonvulsants - mephenytoin (0.15), methsuximide (0.15), phensuximide (0.15) and primidone (0.10); benzodiazepines - clobazam (0.10), flurazepam hydrochloride (0.12), halazepam (0.070), oxazepam (0.030) and temazepam (0.10); anti-inflammatory agents - benoxaprofen (0.040), ibuprofen (0.10 and 0.20), naproxen (0.040) and sulindac (0.075); sedatives and hypnotics - ethinamate (0.75), glutethimide (0.075), methaqualone (0.030 and 0.10) and methprylon (0.30) and the analgesic and antipyretic, aminopyrine (0.15); antifungal - griseofulvin (0.50); anti-androgen - cyproterone acetate (0.020 and 0.050); uricosuric - sulfinpyrazone (0.050 and 0.20); skeletal muscle relaxant - chlorzoxazone (0.20); hydrocholeretic - florantyrone (0.30); anti-hypertensive - prazosin hydrochloride (0.010) and the thyroid inhibitor, methimazole (0.025). The feeding of several of the stimulants at the given levels to intact males elicited wet and dry liver enlargement. Most of the current test agents as screened in operated rats, had little effect on the regeneration and in fact, tended to depress the process when higher levels were fed or injected.",

Besides the authors refer 49 endoscopies of the colon. Endoscopic indications of the UGT included evaluation of the esophagus in gastro-esophageal reflux, achalasia, lye ingestion, gastro-duodenal ulcer, bleedings of UGT, removal of foreign bodies. The indication of the colonoscopy included bleedings and all symptoms of colitis. The endoscopic procedures were done under sedation or in general anesthesia.",

Midazolam 15 mg and lorazepam 2.5 mg were given orally in a single dose the night before operation. Sleep latency was shortest on midazolam but the mean duration of sleep longest on lorazepam. Four patients on lorazepam complained of headache and one reported tinnitus. Three patients receiving midazolam complained of headache. Headache was observed also in one patient given placebo and another experienced tachycardia. Midazolam administered the night before surgery is a preferable hypnotic for transient insomnia caused by preoperative anxiety.",

Tests of psychomotor performance and analogues of car driving ability were administered the morning following night-time medication. Changes with respect to placebo in an information-processing task one hour after taking the medications confirmed the hypnotic efficacy of zopiclone, triazolam and flunitrazepam. Flunitrazepam also produced a significant depression of the Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold (CFF) and increased subjective ratings of sedation one hour after nocturnal dosing. Flunitrazepam impaired the reaction time on the information-processing test the morning following doses of 1 mg.",

Tracazolate (5 mg/kg) had an anxiolytic action that was no longer observed at higher doses (10-25 mg/kg); in the holeboard tracazolate produced a dose-related (5-25 mg/kg) depression of exploratory head-dipping, locomotor activity and rearing. The effects of tracazolate in the social interaction test, but not in the holeboard, could be reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg).",

Due to many different pharmacokinetic properties, no perfect rules for dosage in acute or chronic hemodialysis exist. Adequate applicable drugs without adaptation disregarding different states of renal failure are such with predominate hepatic metabolism and elimination or with inactive metabolites. In the management of acute renal failure, usually in connection with multiple organic disorders, a nonschematic, individually adapted therapy is indicated. In some substances, therapy can be determined by control of plasma concentration levels, in other drugs dosage is possible exclusively according to clinical effects. Substances with side effects on coagulation or acid-base equilibrium should be avoided. It is recommendable to get well acquainted with one substance out of each group in order to avoid polypragmasy.",

Plasma concentration of the drug was measured by gaschromatography with electron capture detector. Six healthy males were each given both formulations. With the oral solution higher plasma peak concentration and a shorter peak time were observed than with tablets.

    "56": "7-Bromo-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-2-(methoxymethyl)-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine X HCl (metaclazepam, KC-2547, Ka-2547, Talis) is a novel 1,4-benzodiazepine characterized by a high selectivity of its anxiolytic effects. The present experiments were performed to contribute to its general pharmacological profile and to evaluate possible risks especially on the cardiovascular field in comparison to standard benzodiazepines. The experiments were performed in guinea pig isolated ileal and papillary muscle preparations, anesthetized cats and dogs, conscious renal hypertensive (RHR) and pithed rats. At intravenous, intraduodenal and repeated oral administration of metaclazepam in anesthetized cats and dogs and RHR arterial hypotension, if any, occurred only at rather high dosages. Tilting experiments in dogs did not show any risk for postural hypotension due to metaclazepam. In guinea pig papillary muscles and in anesthetized dogs (i.v.), metaclazepam had a moderate negative inotropic effect. A diminution of stroke volume was seen only at high i.v. doses whereas cardiac output was maintained nearly constant by an increase in heart rate. In guinea pig papillary muscles metaclazepam, like diazepam, had only a tendency to prolong the refractory period. Unlike diazepam, i.v. metaclazepam had no relevant depressant effect on respiration in anesthetized cats. No specific interaction of metaclazepam with alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors was found in pithed rats and anesthetized cats. The papaverine-like, unspecific spasmolytic profile in the guinea pig isolated ileum suggests that metaclazepam has no relevant antimuscarinic properties. In anesthetized cats neither metaclazepam nor diazepam showed an effect on neuromuscular transmission; metaclazepam caused a markedly weaker inhibition of the polysynaptic linguomandibular reflex than diazepam and did not influence the monosynaptic patellar reflex. In conclusion, the results with metaclazepam did not indicate side effects limiting its therapeutic use as an anxiolytic. Its potential in producing untoward side effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and its central muscle relaxant properties appear to be considerably weaker than with diazepam or bromazepam. Substantial overdosage may result in hypotension and/or impairment of cardiac contractility.", 
    "57": "Sixty (60) out-patients with DSM III generalized anxiety disorder were treated after a 1-week placebo washout in a 4-week double-blind study with buspirone, diazepam and placebo; after which they were withdrawn abruptly from medication or assigned to a 2-week period of placebo. The HAM-A score was significantly lower in the diazepam group at week 2 (p less than .02) and the buspirone group at week 3 (p less than .04) as compared to the placebo group. A similar pattern was evident in the female group, but not in the male group. Dizziness was the most prominent adverse effect in the buspirone group, whereas the diazepam group had more adverse effects including sedation, fatigue, dizziness and impaired concentration. Withdrawal symptoms were more evident in the diazepam group than the buspirone group.", 
    "58": "Sleep and wakefulness are two active states of the central nervous system, and sleep is further subdivided into two components: orthodox sleep (OS) and paradoxical sleep (PS). The relationships between sleep and wakefulness are asymmetrical inasmuch as wakefulness can override sleep whereas the converse occurs much more rarely. This probably indicates that sleep and wakefulness are mediated by different sorts of neurotransmitter systems. The types of neurotransmission, and the concepts of cotransmitter and neuromodulation are briefly outlined. The role of particular wiring of some neurones is also relevant in the understanding vigilance regulation. Activation of catecholamine pathways is coincident with wakefulness and deactivation is one of the conditions necessary for sleep to take place. The induction of PS is also positively related to brain catecholaminergic activity; the level of activation of these systems appears, however, to be lower during PS than during wakefulness. Serotonin, once thought to be the main transmitter in sleep, now appears to regulate the synthesis of yet unidentified sleep factors, responsible for OS and PS realization. Cholinergic mechanisms are also involved in wakefulness and in PS triggering. Such mechanisms may be part of the switch between wakefulness and PS, possibly by controlling the level of catecholaminergic activity. Gamma-aminobutyric acid also participates in the vigilance states, and benzodiazepines exert hypnogenic effects by modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission. Sleep factors and hypnogenic peptides probably exist, but none of the substances so far described can yet be identified as the critical component in the subtle and still largely elusive mechanisms of vigilance regulation.", 
    "59": "In a group of 70 patients with endogenous depression entering a controlled trial of real versus sham ECT, urinary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) excretion was significantly reduced by comparison with previously studied groups of control subjects, of acute and chronic schizophrenic patients and of anxious patients. However, urinary MHPG was unrelated to severity of depression, or to the presence of delusions, retardation or agitation. MHPG excretion did not predict clinical outcome, or the response to ECT. Urinary MHPG content at trial entry was unrelated to past tricyclic antidepressant or benzodiazepine medication, although an influence of the latter on the findings cannot be excluded, since all patients received benzodiazepine (nitrazepam) night sedation during the trial. During the 4-week trial MHPG excretion remained low and did not increase in relation to change in clinical state, although there was a small but significant increase in patients who received real ECT. The findings confirm that urinary MHPG excretion is reduced in depression, but establish that such reductions are not state dependent. Since the increase in MHPG excretion with ECT is not related to changes in clinical state, the former presumably does not reflect the mechanism of action of ECT.", 
    "60": "This paper reviews the findings and conclusions of the literature pertinent to the Long-Sleep and Short-Sleep selectively-bred lines of mice and challenges the widely-held notion that the selective breeding program was successful in separating alleles for specific sensitivities to just alcohol. Rather, it is argued that these lines of mice were selected for differing activity of a more general process. Recent evidence, as well as reevaluated previous evidence, indicates that Long-Sleep mice are more sensitive to the soporific effects of three major classes of CNS depressants (alcohols, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines), as well as many other anesthesia-inducing compounds (adenosine, chloral hydrate, trichloroethanol, paraldehyde, nitrous oxide, enflurane, and isoflurane). Further, much evidence also supports the conclusion that most of these hypnotic-depressants and anesthetics could exert their soporific influence by a potentiation of GABA activity. The other characteristic of interest in this regard is susceptibility to convulsions. Short-Sleep mice have significantly lower thresholds to both flurothyl-induced and bicuculline-induced convulsions, as well as being more likely to suffer from paroxysms during ethanol withdrawal.", 
    "61": "Twelve volunteers with a complaint of chronic insomnia participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of the effects of buspirone t.i.d. on sleep pattern and daytime function. The drug was tested alone and in combination with flurazepam or triazolam. Buspirone alone did not impair objective measures of daytime wakefulness or performance. Impaired alertness was seen the day after bedtime administration of flurazepam but not after triazolam; buspirone did not alter these effects. Buspirone did not affect the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, a sensitive measure of changes in daytime alertness.", 
    "62": "The use of a multidisciplinary approach--laboratory and clinical pharmacology and experimental and human neurochemistry--has demonstrated that GABA neurons and receptors play a variety of functional roles in the mammalian brain. The present synopsis has been limited to some of the newer aspects of GABA neuron function. Thus there is strong evidence that GABA neurons are involved in the control of cerebral excitability (cf. tables I, II) and in the genesis of at least some seizures states, including certain types of human epilepsy (table III). Furthermore GABA receptor activation can be used to control seizures of diverse etiology and at least one GABA agonist, progabide, is effective in human epilepsy. There is a foundation for the belief that GABA neurons function in the control of affect and emotion. The most convincing evidence is from laboratory and clinical pharmacology studies in depression and models for the development of new antidepressant drugs. GABA agonists act as antidepressants not only in animal models such as learned helplessness, olfactory bulbectomy and the sleep-cycle but also demonstrate an antidepressant action in man. Additionally, the recent studies showing that chronic treatment by antidepressants, induce an increase in 3H-GABA \"B\" binding strongly support a GABAergic contribution in the mechanism of antidepressant drugs (cf. table IV). There is also some evidence for the hypothesis that GABA neurons and receptors participate in the biology of anxiety, or at least the mechanism of action of anxiolytics. This is based mainly on the known molecular pharmacology of the benzodiazepine receptor and the evidence in animal models for anxiety (table V). However in clinical trials the GABA agonist progabide is only a weak anxiolytic. A major function of GABA neurons and receptors is the regulation of the nigro-striatal dopamine pathway (table VI) and the expression of dopamine receptor mediated events (table VII). This modulation probably occurs via at least 3 mechanisms: a tonic inhibition of dopamine neuron activity regulating dopamine synthesis, turnover and release; a long term modulation controlling striatal dopamine receptor numbers, modification of the expression of dopaminergic transmission distal to the dopaminergic synapse.", 
    "63": "This report about muscarinic M1 receptors involved in gastric secretion includes two preliminary summaries concerning: a) gastric secretion regulation and b) the evaluation of our knowledge on muscarinic receptors. Gastric secretion is related to secreting cell masses, chief cell and parietal cell masses, and involves some stimulant compounds such as acetylcholine, gastrin and histamine. The schemes of acid secretion stimulation are based on the interactions between these substances. Parietal cells would have specific receptors for each stimulant or histamine would be the final common mediator for all stimulants. Another scheme can be proposed in which gastrin activity would be related to an antagonism between inhibition effects of somatostatin and the suppression of this inhibition by an histamine-like mediator called antramine. The presence of two different receptors to acetylcholine has been demonstrated for long ago, nicotinic receptors (N) and muscarinic receptors (M.). Studies with agonist and antagonist compounds have allowed to distinguish M1 receptors in autonomic ganglia cells and M2 receptors in skeletal muscle. This difference between M and M receptors might be explained by the conformational structure of the receptors (fig. 1), which has also been used for understanding spatial conformation of the agonists and the antagonists (fig. 2, 3). Pharmacological evidence for distinct M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors was presented in 1978 by Goyal and Rattan; in addition receptor binding studies of atropine and acetylcholine have demonstrated that muscarinic antagonists do not distinguish receptor subtypes while agonists do it (fig. 4). Pirenzepin is a new gastric antisecretory tricyclic compound proposed for the treatment of peptic ulcer. It has a higher affinity for M1 receptors in some tissues (eg autonomic ganglia, cerebral cortex) than in other tissues (eg cardia muscle, smooth muscle from gastrointestinal tract). Low concentrations of pirenzepine displace radiolabeled ligands such as 3H QNB, in certain tissues with high affinity receptors, whereas much higher concentrations of pirenzepine are needed to displace these muscarinic antagonist in other tissues with low-affinity receptors (fig. 5). Pharmacological properties of pirenzepine are different from those of atropine (tab. I). Receptor binding studies have disclosed the ability of pirenzepine to discriminate between muscarinic receptors in different tissues. The lowest Ki, molar concentrations producing half-saturation of receptors, was found in autonomic ganglia, reflecting the great affinity of pirenzepine for the neural muscarinic receptor of this tissue (fig. 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Specific binding of [3H]diazepam to the nuclear, mitochondrial and microsomal subcellular fractions of the rat submaxillary gland is reported. Apparent KD values were similar in the three fractions studied (around 80 nM). The nuclear and mitochondrial fractions contain 95% of the total sites detected (20 pmoles/mg prot.). The sites exhibit a much higher affinity for Ro 5-4864 than for clonazepam or Ro 15-1788, and are not modified by 10(-6) to 10(-4) GABA or 10(-5) M bicuculline. Neither sympathetic denervation or parasympathetic decentralization modified [3H]Dz binding, which is found to be considerably lower in the early post-natal state as well as following duct ligation of the gland of adult rats. The results suggest that these peripheral Bz binding sites are mainly located in the acini. No specific GABA binding or GAD activity was detected either in the presence or absence of NaCl. Very low levels of endogenous GABA (58 +/- 3 nmoles/g tissue) were found in homogenates of the gland.", 
    "65": "Healthy university undergraduates were enrolled in a double-blind study to assess the neurobehavioral effects of seven consecutive nightly ingestions of therapeutic doses of flurazepam (30 mg) or triazolam (0.5 mg). Subjects received one of the two drugs or a placebo. There were no consistent differences between the groups on a baseline neuropsychological examination, which consisted of measures specifically selected because of previous reports of their sensitivity to hypnotic drugs. Analysis of covariance of the posttreatment neuropsychological data (controlling for initial level of performance) revealed no detrimental effects on performance although both drug groups reported more side effects. Possible explanations for and implications of these data are discussed.", 
    "66": "In a double blind comparison the driving ability of 32 outpatients with disomnia was investigated in psychometrical tests and standardized trial runs in road traffic every morning after a single dose and after a 7-day therapy with 20 mg temazepam compared with 2 mg flunitrazepam. As well as standardized driving performance observation a test car was fitted with a drive-recorder which synchronically recorded and digitally registered at 1 s intervals during a 60 min run the speed, the steering wheel velocity, fore-hand-aft and lateral acceleration amongst other data. The individual optimal quotient, as a measure of the degree of efficiency of the information processed in the driver-vehicle-road system, deteriorated significantly after the single dose of flunitrazepam as opposed to temazepam. In a trial run on a well defined test course under strictly standardized conditions, the steering wheel velocity, signifying the quality of steering ability, was highly significantly increased after the single dose as well as after the 7-day treatment with flunitrazepam therefore showing a distinct deterioration of steering ability compared to the temazepam group. The number of errors in technical handling was significantly highly with flunitrazepam at both control time checks than with temazepam.", 
    "67": "Ethyl loflazepate (Victan) is an original 1,4-benzodiazepine (BZD) being used as a potent, nonsedative, minor tranquillizer. Ethyl loflazepate was designed to be a prodrug that would gradually release within the organism an active 1,4-BZD. It was hypothesized that this type of pharmacokinetic profile would dissociate anxiolytic from sedative activities. Previously published pharmacokinetic studies performed in rats, baboons and humans have confirmed that ethyl loflazepate gradually releases in the plasma an active 1,4-BZD, descarboxyloflazepate. In the present study, the activity of ethyl loflazepate and its main plasmatic metabolites were examined in rodent models predictive of anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and sedative properties. The activities of ethyl loflazepate and its metabolites were compared to those of reference BZDs: diazepam, bromazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, clorazepate. Ethyl loflazepate and its metabolites revealed the typical profile of activity of minor tranquillizers. The activity of ethyl loflazepate was long-lasting. The overall anxiolytic potency of ethyl loflazepate was similar to that of diazepam but ethyl loflazepate appeared to be less sedative than diazepam. Thus in the approach-avoidance conflict procedure in rats the threshold anxiolytic doses were 1 and 2 mg/kg i.p. for ethyl loflazepate and diazepam, respectively, whereas the threshold sedative doses were 16 and 8 mg/kg i.p., respectively. In vitro ethyl loflazepate exhibited a weak affinity for the BZD receptor site. In vivo ethyl loflazepate displaced [3H]-flunitrazepam from mice brain membranes with a potency comparable to that of lorazepam. In vitro, descarboxyloflazepate, the main plasmatic metabolites of ethyl loflazepate, revealed a 4-fold greater affinity for the BZD receptor than diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "On the basis of the literature data and their own findings the authors discuss the problem of \"transient\" senile dementia. A special emphasis is given to depressive pseudodementias and somatogenic confusion imitating oligophrenia, particularly to their differentiation from true oligophrenia. The authors also describe supplementary differential-diagnostic tests with the administration of antidepressants (or tranquilizers) and psychostimulators (or nootropic agents), and control examination of mental functions prior to and after drug administration.", 
    "69": "Correlation between specific binding potencies \"in vitro\" of several benzodiazepines and activities in SCR-habituation test is very satisfactory. As the SCR-habituation test might be considered as an elementary model of anxiety state, the test is suggested to be used as an intermediate psychopharmacological tool before clinical study. SCR-magnitude test exhibits no correlation of this kind proving that sedative activity is of a different mechanism.", 
    "70": "Adenosine and the methylxanthines have marked and opposite effects on behavior both of which are now thought to be mediated by cell surface adenosine receptors present in brain. These receptor sites have now been characterized using simple radioreceptor ligand binding techniques. Pharmacologic, autoradiographic and behavioral studies involving adenosine and the methylxanthines strongly suggest a neuromodulatory role for adenosine and indicate that adenosinergic neurons constitute an important central nervous system depressant system. A key component of the adenosinergic system is the adenosine uptake site which represents the inactivation mechanism for receptor mediated adenosine action. The adenosine uptake site can be identified as distinct from the adenosine receptor using a specific ligand. The two key components of the adenosine system, i.e., the receptor and uptake site, can therefore be studied using simple binding techniques. This should facilitate the development of new drugs specific for each system. Adenosine agonists can be expected to have sedative, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic actions whereas adenosine antagonists such as caffeine have stimulant and anxiogenic properties. Adenosine uptake blockers should have pharmacologic actions similar to adenosine agonists. The adenosinergic system, therefore, offers unique opportunities for developing new and potentially useful clinical agents.", 
    "71": "Buspirone is a novel anti-anxiety drug which has neither a benzodiazepine structure nor any other benzodiazepine-like properties. Since buspirone is known to block dopamine autoreceptors and increase dopamine metabolism, it was compared to classical antipsychotic drugs for subchronic and chronic effects on dopaminergic function. When continuously infused into rats at 1.0 mg/kg/day s.c. for 2 weeks there was a small diminution of striatal dopamine metabolism response to acute injection of buspirone, but haloperidol produced a normal increase in DOPAC concentrations. In contrast, infusion of 0.3 mg/kg/day of haloperidol caused a marked subsensitivity to both acute buspirone and haloperidol challenge. The data from 3 months of treatment with buspirone or trifluoperazine (3.0 or 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively) added to the rats' drinking water yielded similar results. Also, there was no alteration of dopamine autoreceptor sensitivity or postsynaptic D2 receptor sensitivity in 3 month buspirone treated rats. Three months of trifluoperazine produced a 45% increase in striatal binding of 3H-spiperone, which was reversed by simultaneous administration of buspirone during the final 2 weeks of trifluoperazine treatment. These data indicate that buspirone in moderate doses, such as used for treating anxiety, should be free of extrapyramidal side-effects. The modulation of neuroleptic-induced increased D2 receptor binding reinforces the hypothesis that buspirone has a modulatory effect at an unknown site within the extrapyramidal system.", 
    "72": "The effect of a single, oral bedtime dose of the benzodiazepine hypnotics flunitrazepam (FR; 2 mg), flurazepam (FR; 30 mg), and triazolam (TR; 0.5 mg) on the sleep stages and the sleep EEG was investigated in eight healthy, young subjects. In comparison to the placebo night, all drugs reduced the percentage of stage 1 and REM sleep, increased stage 2, and decreased the number of stage shifts. For FN and FR, some of these changes persisted in the postdrug night. All-night spectral analysis of the EEG showed a reduction of low-frequency activity (0.25-10.0 Hz) in stages 2, 3 + 4 and REM sleep, changes that persisted for all three drugs in the post-drug night. In the drug nights, activity in the spindle frequency range (11-14 Hz) was enhanced particularly in stage 2 and 3 + 4, activity in the high frequency range (17-25 Hz) particularly in REM sleep and stage 1. In the first third of the drug night, the depression of low-frequency activity in stage 2 was either absent (FR) or less prominent (FN, TR) than in the following part of the night. The results demonstrate that benzodiazepine hypnotics induce specific changes in the EEG spectra which reflect the immediate and residual drug effects more sensitively than conventional sleep scores.", 
    "73": "In 8 healthy male volunteers the pharmacodynamic responses to a single dose of diazepam and a single dose of procainamide were assessed before and after pre-treatment with the H2-receptor antagonist famotidine in a randomized crossover study. The pharmacokinetics of diazepam and procainamide were also studied, and the binding of famotidine to human liver microsomes was also measured. Cimetidine induced binding changes with a spectral dissociation constant (Ks) of 0.87 mM, whereas famotidine produced no measurable spectral alteration in concentrations up to 4 mM. The elimination half-life (t1/2: 45.6 h) and total plasma clearance (CL: 0.28 ml/min/kg) of diazepam were not significantly altered by famotidine (t1/2 = 39.0 +/- 11.4 h; CL = 0.31 +/- 0.08 ml/min/kg). Similarly, there was no enhancement of the sedative effect of diazepam by famotidine. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), too, were not significantly changed by famotidine: procainamide t1/2 2.9 vs 3.0 h under famotidine and renal clearance (CLR) 436 vs 443 ml/min; and NAPA CLR 195 vs 212 ml/min under famotidine. The data suggest that famotidine, in contrast to cimetidine, does not affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam (hepatic elimination) or procainamide (tubular secretion). This new H2-receptor antagonist appears to be devoid of an interaction potential for either type of drug elimination.", 
    "74": "Two hundred and ninety-nine patients requiring treatment for a sleep disturbance were recruited into a double-blind multi-centre trial by 47 doctors. Patients received either 1 mg flunitrazepam or 20 mg temazepam for from 7 to 14 days. Analysis of the results of assessment in 246 patients by doctors and patients indicated that flunitrazepam was significantly better than temazepam in the improvement of onset of sleep, reduction in nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings. The solicited event profiles of both treatments were similar and consistent with the low risk expected of a hypnotic.", 
    "75": "The effects of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists on psychometric tests including vehicle handling, choice reaction time, and kinetic visual acuity (KVA), are reviewed. The beta-blockers had little effect on the performance tests, with the unexplained but reproducible effect of enhanced KVA performance with atenolol. Although the beta-blockers had little effect on performance tests they were shown to have psychotropic effects in normal volunteers. The reasons for the conflicting evidence concerning the effect of these drugs on performance tests is discussed in relation to the present experiments and to variables that may influence response. It is concluded that one should use tests that are as independent as possible from potentially confounding variables. The use of evoked potentials in the electroencephalogram is one such test. A preliminary study is described in which the effects of beta-blockers were detected using visual evoked responses on the electroencephalogram.", 
    "76": "Tests of psychometric function were performed in young, normal volunteers taking several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. With single doses of atenolol, a cardioselective hydrophilic beta-blocker, dose-dependent effects were apparent and were maximal at a dose of 200 mg. The lipophilic non-selective beta-blocker, propranolol, also produced significant impairment of psychomotor tests but these were inversely related to dose, the longest effects being at a dose of 40 mg but with little effect at 320 mg. Subsequently, a multisubject comparison of propranolol and atenolol confirmed these findings and showed the effects to be of the same order of magnitude as those produced by diazepam. Chronic administration of atenolol 100 mg, nadolol 80 mg and diazepam 5 mg daily for seven days showed some effects with all drugs during the test period; however, these were sporadic rather than persistent. Overall, beta-blockers do appear to have central effects in man which can be demonstrated by psychomotor tests. However, the relevance of these central effects to maintenance therapy and skilled performance is unclear.", 
    "77": "The metabolism of ethyl loflazepate (Victan), a new benzodiazepine used as an anxiolytic drug, was studied in man and several animal species. The urinary metabolites were determined and quantified following oral administration of the 14C-labeled drug. Further analysis of blood samples was carried out in order to get information on the circulating metabolites in man. Except the rat, from which only 25% of the administered dose were excreted via the kidneys, the urine appeared to be the main excretion route in man (63%) and the other animal species (80%). The major urinary metabolites were identified as being loflazepate, 3-hydroxyloflazepate, 3-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate, 4'-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate and 6-chloro-4-(2'-fluorophenyl)-2(1H)-quinazolinone. The observed differences on the excretion patterns between the species resulted from the presence of a large number of quantitatively minor metabolites. Analysis of human blood samples indicated that the radioactivity was almost entirely in the plasma. The main circulating metabolites were detected as descarbethoxyloflazepate, loflazepate, and 3-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate.", 
    "78": "The paper describes a screening procedure for 7-Chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-(cyclohexene-1-yl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine -2-one (Tetrazepam, Musaril) and other important analytical data (TLC, GLC, UV-, IR-, and mass spectra).", 
    "79": "Some characteristics of the discriminative stimulus (cue) effects of midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, have been determined in rats. A standard two-bar operant conditioning procedure with food reinforcers delivered on a tandem schedule was used. The 0.4 mg/kg dose of midazolam used for training was well discriminated, typically yielding at least 95% correct responding. Other benzodiazepines increased the percentage of drug-appropriate responding in a dose-related manner and were generalized at doses which had little effect on the overall rate of responding. Doses of pentobarbitone which greatly reduced the overall rate of responding were also generalized with midazolam. Amphetamine, oxotremorine, picrotoxin, morphine, nicotine, quipazine and Ro 15-1788 were not generalized, even at doses which severely suppressed overall response rates. The midazolam cue possesses a considerable degree of specificity and provides a potentially useful assay for drug action at the benzodiazepine receptor complex."
