This article compares the effects of olanzapine and placebo in the emergence of hallucinations or delusions in AD patients with symptoms of agitation/aggression but little or no psychotic symptomatology at baseline.", 
    "1": "A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in nursing home patients with AD according to DSM-IV criteria and symptoms of agitation/aggression and/or psychosis. Patients (N = 206) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or fixed-dose olanzapine (5, 10, or 15 mg/day) for up to 6 weeks. This article analyzes data from a subgroup of patients (N = 165) with no or minimal delusions and/or hallucinations at baseline as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI/NH). Three subsets of patients were identified on the basis of their symptoms at baseline: those with no clinically significant hallucinations, those with no clinically significant delusions, and those with no clinically significant delusions or hallucinations.", 
    "2": "Of the patients without hallucinations or delusions at baseline (N = 75), the placebo-treated patients showed significantly greater development of these symptoms compared with olanzapine-treated patients overall (NPI/NH hallucinations + delusions mean change score, +2.73 vs. +0.27, p = .006). Similarly, of the patients without baseline hallucinations (N = 153), the placebo-treated patients showed greater hallucinations score increases than did olanzapine-treated patients overall (+1.25 vs. +0.33, p = .026), whereas patients without baseline delusions (N = 87) showed no significant treatment effects. Olanzapine had a favorable safety profile in each patient subset.", 
    "3": "These results suggest that, overall, olanzapine effectively attenuated emergence of psychosis in a short-term trial of patients with Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "4": "There is a clear need for effective, well-tolerated intramuscular (i.m.) agents for the acute control of agitated psychotic patients. Currently used agents, including conventional antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines, may be associated with distressing side effects such as extrapyramidal side effects and excessive sedation.", 
    "5": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the rapid-acting i.m. formulation of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone in the treatment of inpatients with psychosis and acute agitation (DSM-IV diagnoses).", 
    "6": "In a 24-hour, double-blind, fixed-dose clinical trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive up to 4 injections (every 2 hours p.r.n.) of 2 mg (N = 54) or 10 mg (N = 63) of ziprasidone i.m. The Behavioral Activity Rating Scale measured behavioral symptoms at baseline and the response to treatment up to 4 hours after the first i.m. injection.", 
    "7": "Ziprasidone i.m., 10 mg, rapidly reduced symptoms of acute agitation and was significantly more effective (p < .01) than the 2-mg dose up to 4 hours after the first injection. Patients were calmed but not excessively sedated, and over half were classed as responders 2 hours after the 10-mg dose. No acute dystonia or behavioral disinhibition was reported. One patient who received the 10-mg dose experienced the extrapyramidal side effect akathisia.", 
    "8": "Ziprasidone i.m., 10 mg, is rapidly effective and well tolerated in the short-term management of the agitated psychotic patient. Comparison with a study of identical design comparing 2-mg with 20-mg doses in patients with similar levels of psychopathology suggests that efficacy with 10 mg or 20 mg of ziprasidone i.m. is significant and dose related.", 
    "9": "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) differs from depression with melancholic features in atypical symptoms, such as hyperphagia, hypersomnia and weight gain. Moreover, SAD is confined to a certain season of the year. We examined the pharmacological efficacy of alprazolam for treatment of patients with SAD. Six patients with SAD were treated with alprazolam at doses of 1.2 mg/day or 1.2 mg/day first and then 2.4 mg/day for 2 weeks. The improvement was evaluated by the change of total score of the SIGH-SAD (with both 21 items HAMD and eight items atypical symptoms) and the clinical global impression (CGI). Although only two patients showed a remarkable improvement by SIGH-SAD, all patients showed a higher than moderate improvement with CGI. Our findings suggest that alprazolam might be efficacious for certain SAD patients.", 
    "10": "Eclampsia is the third commonest cause of maternal mortality after haemorrhage and infection. The morbidity and mortality in eclampsia is related to the number of convulsions. The control of convulsions is, therefore, important in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. Teaching hospitals in Southern Africa contributed to the multicentre Collaborative Eclampsia Trial, which provided the overwhelming evidence for the superiority of magnesium sulphate as the drug of choice for eclampsia. While other parts of the world have put this evidence into practice, this trend has not yet become uniform in Africa. This paper seeks to encourage African governments, teaching hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry and the regional Cochrane Collaboration Centre in South Africa to co-operate in order to facilitate the practice of evidence-based medicine in this aspect of maternal health in the region.",

    "12": "An open-pilot study of olanzapine (5 mg) in patients with clinical and genetic diagnosis of Huntington disease was used. The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale for clinical assessment and the Total Functional Capacity score for the disease-stage evaluation were used. A statistical analysis was performed to compare the effects of olanzapine on the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale scores at time 0 (baseline) and at time 1 (6 months). Comparisons of motor scores, of single behavioral items, and of TFC scores were performed within the group.", 
    "13": "The behavioral assessment score of items regarding depression, anxiety, irritability, and obsessions showed a significant improvement (range of p, 0.0134-0.048). Given the total behavioral scores (sum of all the items investigated), five patients significantly improved their behavioral score after a 6-month treatment (range of p, 0.013-0.047). Choreic movements improved, although not significantly (0.05 < or = p < or = 1).", 
    "14": "Olanzapine is a potentially useful antipsychotic drug, with significant short-term effects on behavioral changes, mainly in patients with severe psychiatric symptoms at the onset. It might be considered as a possible therapeutic choice for treatment of Huntington disease.", 
    "15": "Three cholecystokinin type B (CCKB) receptor antagonists were labelled with 11C and evaluated ex vivo in rat biodistribution studies. The CCKB antagonists were YF 476 and two other compounds of the basic 3-ureido-1,4-benzodiazepine class. Following tail-vein administration of [11C]-YF 476 exceedingly low levels of radioactivity were found in all brain regions from 5 to 60 min post-injection. Similar results were obtained using the other two 11C-labelled CCKB antagonists. In light of the very poor brain penetration of these compounds, reports on the central nervous system activity of this class of CCKB antagonists should be viewed with caution.", 
    "16": "Mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and expression of withdrawal syndrome have not fully clarified despite of huge accumulation of experimental and clinical data at present. Several clinical features of withdrawal syndrome are considered to be common among patients with drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse. One of them is anxiety. Recent investigations have revealed that diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a peptide consisting of 87 amino acids with molecular weight of about 10 kDa, serves as an inverse agonist for benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors with endogenously anxiogenic potential. These lines of data suggest that cerebral DBI expression in brain may participates in formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome. Based on this working hypothesis, we have examined DBI expression in the brain derived from mice depended on alcohol (ethanol), nicotine, and morphine to investigate functional relationship between cerebral DBI expression and drug dependence. Cerebral DBI expression significantly increases in animals with drug dependence induced by these drugs, and in the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice concomitant administration of antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and opioid receptors, respectively, abolished the increase. Abrupt cessation of administration of drugs facilitated further increase in DBI expression. Therefore, these alterations in DBI expression have close relationship with formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome, and are considered to be a common biochemical process in drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse. Finding and elucidation of mechanisms for common biochemical alterations among drug dependence may provide a clue to clarify mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "17": "Clinicians in the emergency department are often confronted with coma patients due to poisoning. A systematic general approach involving early consultation with a neurologist is of paramount importance. A high index of suspicion, a systematic first assessment already in the prehospital phase and early stabilisation of vital functions are the essential first steps. Specific antidotes like hypertonic glucose and thiamine are part of a \"coma cocktail\". The opiate antagonist naloxone should be used only when clinically indicated and in a titrated way. Flumazenil should only be used with caution and in restricted cases. Clinical neurological evaluation and technical investigations like CT-scan and laboratory tests should make part of a careful diagnostic plan. Toxicological tests deserve their place in the diagnostic work up of a coma patient with suspected poisoning. Knowledge of the possibilities of the toxicology lab and optimal communication with the clinical toxicologist is important for optimal patient care.", 
    "18": "Emergencies caused by acute poisoning amount to 3-5% of the actions carried out by the emergency medical service. Sleep supporting drugs have a 35% part in the acute drug-induced poisoning, primarily within the framework of suicidal or parasuicidal actions. In this case, benzodiazepines occupy a top position, followed by H1-antihistaminic agents with strong sedative effects, and the so-called anxiolytic agents of the \"second generation\". In general, intoxication with sleep supporting drugs lead to disturbances of consciousness with different degrees of seriousness. Careful (external) anamnesis, inspection of the environment and clinical investigations could be helpful to evaluate the diagnosis. Hypoglycemia and neurological illnesses are to be excluded differential diagnostically. Preclinical therapy follows the \"five finger rule\" (stabilization of the vital functions, detoxification, antidote therapy, asservation, transportation). Specific procedures (preclinical stomach lavage, antidote therapy) are indicated in rare cases, only (mainly mixed intoxication with ethanol). Subsequent therapeutic procedures under clinical conditions are demonstrated using selected examples.", 
    "19": "Antidepressants and neuroleptics are an essential tool for the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with defined psychiatric disorders. They may also be used 2nd choice for the treatment of psychophysiological insomnia. There is some evidence of a \"causal\" therapeutic action of some antidepressants in sleep disorders. Here, antidepressants and neuroleptics ought to be given in severe and/or chronic cases and to patients which are particularly vulnerable to the addictive potential of benzodiazepines and their analogues. They may be given during routine wash-out periods for benzodiazepines or loss of action, and for the treatment of psychiatrically related syndromes. Because of the higher incidence of aversive, even serious side-effects, careful benefit-risk evaluations and intense control studies are warranted.", 
    "20": "Pharmacological therapies are presented for two typical neurological sleep-wake disorders, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and narcolepsy. The individual discomfort caused by RLS and the accompanying problems with initiating and maintaining sleep often require a therapy with L-dopa and dopamine agonists. Positive treatment effects on sensory and motor symptoms have been shown in open trials and controlled studies. Development of time shift and/or augmentation of symptoms is a problem of L-dopa therapy. Further efficient drugs are opioids and benzodiazepines. The therapy of narcolepsy depends on its severity and the pattern of the symptoms. Excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks are the most impairing symptoms, which are difficult to treat. These symptoms require an optimal combination of CNS stimulants with regular napping. Cataplexy and other REM sleep associated symptoms are effectively treated with REM sleep suppressing antidepressants.", 
    "21": "After first giving an overview about the epidemiological situation, the indications and contraindications of benzodiazepines as well as those of the newer short-time hypnotics zolpidem and zopiclone are reviewed. Premises for their use and alternatives to their application are discussed and the different substances are discussed for their clinical use. Problems of drug abuse and addiction are accounted in detail for these effective and little toxic agents. Finally recommendations for treatment are given to contribute to a more critical and scientific way of prescribing these valuable, though problematic, drugs.", 
    "22": "For the treatment of insomnia/sleep disturbances, drugs are indicated only if non-drug-procedures alone are not sufficiently successful or not successful at all. To facilitate sleep, sedative-hypnotic agents are used clinically. Because of favorable risk-benefit ratio, non-benzodiazepines with benzodiazepine-like action (zolpidem, zopiclon) or benzodiazepines themselves (dependent on their pharmacokinetic profil) are administered in the most cases. Sedative-hypnotic drugs reducing the electric activity of the CNS sufficiently to produce coma and even death are not recommended at present. To assess the clinical relevance of amino acid L-tryptophan for the treatment of insomnia/sleep disturbances, more controlled clinical studies are necessary. The nonprescription antihistamines (Doxylamin, Diphenhydramin) are only suitable for short-term administration in adults. Under certain conditions, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs can be taken. Because of potential risks, the intake demands caution. Different herbal remedies are recommended, but only for extracts of valerian a sleep-inducing effect can be assumed. Melatonin, an endogenous hormone and tryptophan-metabolite is thought to be involved with the sleep-wake cycle. Therefore the exogenous intake of melatonin may influence vigilance and sleep. This is particularly true for patients with jet-lag symptoms.", 
    "23": "Previously, a double-blind, 6-week, parallel-group trial compared the therapeutic profiles of olanzapine (5-20 mg/day; N = 1,336) and haloperidol (5-20 mg/day; N = 660) in 1996 patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia (83.1%) or schizophreniform (1.9%) or schizoaffective disorders (15.0%) and showed olanzapine to have a superior, broader spectrum of efficacy as well as a more favorable adverse event profile. The present post hoc analysis examined the efficacy of olanzapine compared with haloperidol in the schizophrenic cohort of that study and in subgroups of schizophrenic patients defined by baseline symptom profile and course of illness.", 
    "24": "A total of 1,658 patients were included. Patients were included in analyses of change if they had both a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measurement (N = 1,622; 1,096 olanzapine-treated patients, 526 haloperidol-treated patients). An analysis of variance was used to compare treatment effects on efficacy measurements including the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; scored 0-6) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (total, positive subscale, and negative subscale scores).", 
    "25": "Olanzapine-treated patients exhibited statistically significantly greater improvements from baseline (last observation carried forward) on all efficacy measurements. Olanzapine-treated patients with predominantly positive, predominantly negative, or mixed symptoms had statistically significantly greater improvements in BPRS total scores compared with similar haloperidol-treated patients. Patients with primarily chronic negative symptoms and patients with chronic or subchronic courses of illness had statistically significantly greater mean improvements from baseline on the BPRS total with olanzapine compared with haloperidol. Furthermore, within the olanzapine treatment group, patients with a subchronic course of illness had greater mean improvements than patients with a chronic course of illness.", 
    "26": "Olanzapine was more effective than haloperidol in treating a varied spectrum of patients with schizophrenia, including patients with positive, negative, or mixed symptom profiles and either a chronic or subchronic course of illness.", 
    "27": "Schizophrenic patients who have been prescribed atypical antipsychotics have a potential risk of gaining weight. The implications of weight gain for clinical care may differ depending on whether a patient is underweight or overweight at baseline. The exact mechanism for weight gain is not known, but several factors have been identified that can help predict which patients are at risk for gaining weight. These factors include better clinical outcome, increased appetite, and low baseline body mass index. In patients treated with olanzapine for up to 3 years, weight gain trended toward a plateau at approximately 36 weeks. Weight gain interventions, including behavioral modifications, show promise in controlling or reducing weight in patients treated with antipsychotics.", 
    "28": "Alterations of electrocardiogram results and cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported since the beginning of neuroleptic treatment. In particular, a temporal association exists between some antipsychotics and prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc), an event that may increase the risk for developing a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes if it significantly exceeds normal intraindividual and interindividual variation. Although the incidence of serious adverse cardiac events in response to antipsychotic medications is relatively low, any possibility for the occurrence of cardiotoxicity warrants continued study. The present article reviews important differences among antipsychotic drugs in the potential for, and occurrence of, serious adverse cardiac outcomes and suggests that olanzapine, as therapeutically administered to patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses, does not contribute significantly to a QTc prolongation that could result in potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "29": "This multicenter, open-label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia who had been nonresponsive or intolerant to a course of risperidone (mean duration of risperidone treatment = 46.3 days).", 
    "30": "A total of 34 patients with DSM-III-R and ICD-9 schizophrenia entered this trial. Twenty-five patients were nonresponsive to previous risperidone treatment, 6 patients were intolerant to the risperidone treatment, and 3 patients listed both reasons for discontinuation of risperidone. Patients were treated across a dose range of 5 to 25 mg/day of olanzapine. The primary efficacy variable was baseline to endpoint change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score. Safety was assessed using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale.", 
    "31": "Improvement from baseline PANSS score (mean +/- SD PANSS score = 119.4 +/- 26.9) was evident at the week-6 midpoint (-22.2 +/- 19.5) and at the week-14 endpoint (-28.7 +/- 22.3). On average, severity ratings were reduced from baseline by 25% after 14 weeks of olanzapine therapy. Twenty olanzapine-treated patients (58.8%) achieved the a priori-defined response criterion of > or = 20% reduction in PANSS total score. Among patients who met the response criterion, 50% (10/20) had done so by the fourth week. These clinical improvements occurred across a broad range of symptom domains and included reductions in PANSS positive, negative, general psychopathology, and mood subscores. No statistically significant differences were found on any efficacy measure at any visit between the patients who were nonresponsive to risperidone compared with those who were intolerant to risperidone. Olanzapine was well tolerated, with no subject discontinuing early owing to an intolerable adverse event that could be conclusively linked to olanzapine.", 
    "32": "The results of this open-label study suggest that olanzapine may be an effective alternative for schizophrenic patients who are nonresponsive and/or intolerant to risperidone treatment. Moreover, the results underscore the differential pharmacology that exists among the newer antipsychotic agents.", 
    "33": "Thirty-five patients suffering from schizophrenia, as diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, were preselected from 7 clinical trials according to a priori criteria of catatonic signs and symptoms based on 3 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) items: scores for PANSS item 19 (mannerism and posturing) and either item 4 (excitement) or item 21 (motor retardation) had to exceed or equal 4 at baseline. This particular patient population represents a severely psychotic sample: mean +/- SD PANSS total scores at baseline were 129.26 +/- 19.76. After I week of olanzapine treatment, mean PANSS total score was decreased significantly (-13.14; p < .001), as was mean PANSS total score after 6 weeks of olanzapine treatment (-45.16; p < .001); additionally, the positive subscale, negative subscale, and mood scores improved significantly. A significant improvement in the catatonic signs and symptoms composite score was also observed at week 6 (-4.96; p < .001). The mean +/- SD daily dose of olanzapine was 18.00 +/- 2.89 mg after 6 weeks of treatment. The present data analysis suggests the efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of severely ill schizophrenic patients with nonspecified catatonic signs and symptoms.", 
    "34": "Rapid tranquilization of acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia is usually carried out using typical antipsychotic agents. The objective of such treatment is to control agitation, not to treat psychosis, which usually responds only after a few weeks of treatment. An intramuscular formulation of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was developed for treatment of agitation in acutely psychotic patients. Studies conducted to assess control of agitation in schizophrenia also investigated the positive symptom efficacy of olanzapine when used to provide rapid tranquilization. This article summarizes the results of 3 clinical trials with intramuscular olanzapine with regard to positive symptom efficacy as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; 0-6 scale) positive subscale. In 2 open-label trials, patients treated with intramuscular olanzapine experienced a mean decrease from baseline in BPRS positive subscale score. In 1 double-blind clinical trial of intramuscular olanzapine versus intramuscular haloperidol and intramuscular placebo, the mean decrease from baseline in BPRS positive subscale score for patients treated with intramuscular olanzapine was statistically significant (p < .05). In all 3 studies, positive symptom improvement continued following transition to oral olanzapine. These results suggest that intramuscular olanzapine has positive symptom efficacy early in the course of treatment and may provide a smooth transition to maintenance therapy with oral olanzapine.", 
    "35": "Behavioral agitation and prominent positive psychotic symptoms often characterize the acute presentation of schizophrenia. The clinical treatment goal is a rapid control of these symptoms. The relative efficacy of olanzapine, a novel antipsychotic drug, was compared with that of the conventional antipsychotic drug haloperidol. A post hoc analysis conducted on a large multicenter, double-blind, 6-week study of acute-phase patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders treated with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) or haloperidol (5-20 mg/day) assessed the treatment effects on agitation (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] agitation score) and positive symptoms (BPRS positive symptom score). Overall, olanzapine-treated patients experienced significantly greater improvement in behavioral agitation than did haloperidol-treated patients (last observation carried forward [LOCF]; p < .0002). Both groups showed similar reductions in agitation scores during the first 3 weeks of therapy; olanzapine was associated with significantly greater improvements at weeks 4, 5, and 6 (observed cases [OC]). Similarly, patients with predominantly positive psychotic symptoms experienced significantly greater improvement in BPRS positive symptom scores with olanzapine compared with haloperidol (LOCF; p = .013). In olanzapine-treated patients, improvement in BPRS agitation and positive symptom scores was significantly greater at weeks 4, 5, and 6 (agitation scores, p < or = .01; positive symptom scores, p < .05) (OC). These data suggest that olanzapine may be considered a first-line treatment for the patient in an acute episode of schizophrenia.", 
    "36": "Acute, high-dose loading strategies (rapid neuroleptization) with the first-generation antipsychotics administered orally or parenterally, alone or combined with benzodiazepines, have been a commonly used treatment paradigm for controlling acutely agitated psychotic patients. The rationale was to achieve high plasma levels of drug within a shorter time period, resulting in rapid symptom mitigation. However, studies have shown that rapid neuroleptization with first-generation antipsychotics is associated with a greater incidence of side effects. To our knowledge, loading strategies with second-generation antipsychotics have not been investigated, primarily owing to a need for dose titration. Olanzapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, is well tolerated in doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg. The objective of this report was to determine experience with the use of up to 20 mg of an oral loading dose of olanzapine administered within 4 hours in the treatment of patients early in an acute psychotic phase of their illness. In the reported case series of 57 patients, olanzapine initiated at 15 to 20 mg/day was a safe and effective medication for rapidly calming the agitation of acutely agitated psychotic patients (rapid tranquilization). Furthermore, dose reduction over 2 to 3 weeks was achieved in a number of patients without appreciable loss of efficacy.", 
    "37": "Hepatic encephalopathy is considered to be a reversible metabolic encephalopathy, which occurs as a complication of hepatocellular failure and is associated with increased portal-systemic shunting of gut-derived nitrogenous compounds. Its manifestations are most consistent with a global depression of CNS function, which could arise as a consequence of a net increase in inhibitory neurotransmission, due to an imbalance between the functional status of inhibitory (e.g., GABA) and excitatory (e.g., glutamate) neurotransmitter systems. In liver failure, factors that contribute to increased GABAergic tone include increased synaptic levels of GABA and increased brain levels of natural central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonists. Ammonia, present in modestly elevated levels, may also augment GABAergic tone by direct interaction with the GABAA receptor, synergistic interactions with natural central BZ receptor agonists, and stimulation of astrocytic synthesis and release of neurosteroid agonists of the GABAA receptor. Thus, there is a rationale for therapies of HE that lower ammonia levels and incrementally reduce increased GABAergic tone towards the physiologic norm.", 
    "38": "Whether an opiate-benzodiazepine combination is superior to benzodiazepine alone for sedation in upper endoscopy is controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of intravenous midazolam alone versus the combination of intravenous midazolam and intravenous meperidine for the sedation of patients undergoing upper endoscopy.", 
    "39": "One hundred seven patients scheduled for outpatient diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg intravenous meperidine (53 of 107) or placebo (54 of 107). All patients received topical lidocaine spray and as much midazolam as the endoscopist thought the patient needed. Patients and endoscopists were blinded as to assignment. Data collected included intubation time (seconds), procedure time (minutes), pulse, blood pressure, complications, and the need for reversal agents. The endoscopist evaluated the quality of sedation immediately after the procedure (1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = fair, and 4 = poor). The patient evaluated the procedure the next day by phone (1 = no discomfort or did not remember, 2 = slightly uncomfortable, 3 = extremely uncomfortable, and 4 = unacceptable). Patients were also asked whether they would agree to another esophagogastroduodenoscopy if their doctor thought it was medically necessary.", 
    "40": "The intubation time, procedure time and blood pressure were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In comparing the meperidine group versus placebo group, the highest pulse (82.3 vs. 93.7, p = 0.0010), lowest pulse (67.2 vs. 72.3, p = 0.0194) and amount of midazolam used (4.0 vs. 4.8 mg, p = 0.0185 or 0.53 vs. 0.67 mg/kg, p = 0.0083) were significantly different by using a t test analysis. Patient evaluations comparing meperidine versus placebo showed responses of 1 (52 vs. 49), 2 (1 vs. 3), 3 (0 vs. 2) and 4 (0 vs. 0), which were not significantly different. The endoscopists'evaluation comparing meperidine versus placebo gave responses of excellent (44 vs. 27), good (6 vs. 22), fair (3 vs. 5) and poor (0 vs. 0), which were highly significantly different (p < 0.001) by using chi-square statistical techniques.", 
    "41": "The addition of meperidine to midazolam in sedating patients undergoing upper endoscopy adds no benefit from the patient viewpoint, whereas endoscopists favored the use of both medications.", 
    "42": "Benign rolandic epilepsy is the most common epilepsy of childhood. Regarding seizure control typical and atypical rolandic epilepsies have a reasonable prognosis. In a recent prospective study STM was shown to control seizures in BECTS and STM is regarded as first line drug for this epilepsy in countries having access to this drug. Otherwise, CBZ is used most often and very effectively in BECTS. However, CBZ has the disadvantage to worsen clinical and EEG features up to the precipitation of CSWS in few patients. Epileptic seizures are often not the main problem in atypical rolandic epilepsies like CSWS or LKS and the amelioration of cognitive dysfunction by epileptic discharge is the prominent aim of an AED therapy. Steroids seem the have the best efficacy in these cases.", 
    "43": "It is generally known that the substrates and/or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overlap with each other. In intestinal epithelial cells, it is surmised that the metabolites coexist with their parent drug. However, most studies on P-gp did not take the effects of those metabolites into consideration. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of five substrates of CYP3A4 (nifedipine, testosterone, midazolam, amiodarone, and azelastine) and their metabolites on the P-gp-mediated transcellular transport. The transcellular transports of [(3)H]daunorubicin or [(3)H]digoxin by monolayers of LLC-GA5-COL150 cells in which P-gp was overexpressed were measured in the presence or absence of the CYP3A4 substrates and their metabolites. Nifedipine, testosterone, midazolam, and their metabolites exhibited no effects on the P-gp-mediated transport of [(3)H]daunorubicin and [(3)H]digoxin. On the other hand, the transport of [(3)H]daunorubicin was strongly inhibited by amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, azelastine, and desmethylazelastine, with IC(50) values of 22.5, 15.4, 16.0 and 11.8 microM, respectively. The transport of [(3)H]digoxin was also strongly inhibited by these compounds, with IC(50) values of 45.6, 25.2, 30.0 and 41.8 microM, respectively. Another metabolite of azelastine, 6-hydroxyazelastine, exhibited no effects on these transports. It was suggested that the CYP3A4 metabolites of which their parent drug exhibited inhibition on the P-gp-mediated transport are possibly also inhibitors. It would be possible more complicated drug-drug interactions would be caused by the metabolites as well as their parent drugs in the liver and the intestine via the inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp.", 
    "44": "An efficient HPTLC--UV/FTIR coupling procedure is presented for the separation and rapid identification of flurazepam hydrochloride and its related substances in bulk powder and capsules. An optimized mobile phase was developed for the separation on specialized plates for HPTLC--FTIR in situ measurement containing a proportion of 50% magnesium tungstate. The proposed procedure shows several advantages to the related compound test of the pharmacopoeia, e.g. baseline separation of the known impurities and detection of the substances as peaks in the UV, Gram-Schmidt or window chromatograms. Furthermore, unambiguous identification is obtained by postrun extraction of the DRIFT spectra and comparison with reference spectra in the library. Quantification of the related compounds was carried out densitometrically. This method shows that the current resurgence of interest in modern instrumental TLC is rightful based on the flexibility and efficiency of this analytical method.",

Activation of I(Ks) was slow (tau=903+/-101 ms at 50 mV, n=14), but deactivation of the current was relatively rapid (tau=122.4+/-11.7 ms at -40 mV, n=19). The activation of I(Ks) was voltage independent but its deactivation showed clear voltage dependence. The deactivation was faster at negative voltages (about 100 ms at -50 mV) and slower at depolarized potentials (about 300 ms at 0 mV). In six cells, the reversal potential was -81.6+/-2.8 mV on an average which is close to the K(+) equilibrium potential suggesting K(+) as the main charge carrier.",

    "50": "Published data regarding the molecular, animal model, neuroimaging, and clinical aspects of typical and atypical antipsychotics were reviewed to develop this hypothesis. Particular attention was paid to data regarding the role of the serotonin 5-HT(2) and dopamine D(4) receptors in atypicality.", 
    "51": "Neuroimaging data show that optimal dopamine D(2) occupancy is sufficient to produce the atypical antipsychotic effect. Freedom from motor side effects results from low D(2) occupancy, not from high 5-HT(2) occupancy. If D(2) occupancy is excessive, atypicality is lost even in the presence of high 5-HT(2) occupancy. Animal data show that a rapid dissociation from the D(2) receptor at a molecular level produces the atypical antipsychotic effect. In vitro data show that the single most powerful predictor of atypicality for the current generation of atypical antipsychotics is fast dissociation from the D(2) receptor, not its high affinity at 5-HT(2), D(4), or another receptor.", 
    "52": "The authors propose that fast dissociation from the D(2) receptor makes an antipsychotic more accommodating of physiological dopamine transmission, permitting an antipsychotic effect without motor side effects, prolactin elevation, or secondary negative symptoms. In contrast to the multireceptor hypotheses, the authors predict that the atypical antipsychotic effect can be produced by appropriate modulation of the D(2) receptor alone; the blockade of other receptors is neither necessary nor sufficient.",

After the medication was changed to risperidone, there was a dramatic and persistent improvement of the patient's condition.

To facilitate economic comparisons, our sample was restricted to patients enrolled in US sites. 150 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder were randomised to therapy with either olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day (n = 75) or risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day (n = 75) for a maximum of 28 weeks. In addition to tolerability and efficacy assessments, use of health services was assessed at baseline and prospectively, at 8-week intervals and at study completion. Clinically important response, defined as a 40% improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score, maintenance of response and rates of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms were compared between groups. Direct medical costs were estimated by assigning standardised prices to resource units. Median total, inpatient/outpatient service and medication acquisition costs were compared between treatment groups.",

In addition, a smaller proportion of olanzapine-treated patients required anticholinergic therapy compared with risperidone-treated patients (25.3 vs 45.3%; p = 0.016). Total per patient medical costs over the study interval were $US2843 (1997 values) [36%] lower in the olanzapine treatment group than in the risperidone treatment group (p = 0.342). Medication costs were significantly higher for olanzapine-treated patients ($US2513 vs $US1581; p < 0.001), but this difference was offset by a reduction of $US3774 (52%) in inpatient/outpatient service costs for olanzapine-treated patients in comparison with risperidone-treated patients ($US3516 vs $US7291, p = 0.083). Median cost findings were consistent with results observed using other robust measures of central tendency and provide conservative estimates of potential savings that may be obtained from olanzapine therapy.",

    "72": "Several recent studies have demonstrated that alprazolam and lorazepam, administered at low doses to healthy volunteers, improve cognitive functions and psychomotor performances. Paradoxical effects of low-dose benzodiazepines have been also observed in mice, in experimental pharmacology. The aim of this work was to determine, in rat, the effect of similar low-doses of benzodiazepines on spontaneous locomotor activity and performance in the elevated zero-maze, and to investigate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The dose-effect and the time-course of the action were studied for both compounds. Spontaneous locomotor activity was measured using a photoelectric actimeter. The level of anxiety of the animals was assessed in the elevated zero-maze. Dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites were assayed in the extracellular striatal fluid of the awake rat, obtained by microdialysis, by HPLC--EC. Spontaneous locomotor activity observed in rats given low-dose alprazolam and lorazepam evidenced a stimulatory effect only with alprazolam. The effect was maximum 90 min after administration of 0.0050 mg/kg alprazolam. An anxiogenic-like action was evidenced with the elevated zero-maze for the two compounds. We observed a statistically significant increase in striatal dopamine concentrations only with alprazolam, during the period corresponding to the behavioral stimulatory effects. We also showed a marked trend towards increased levels of serotonin with alprazolam but this modification was not significant, in spite of statistically significant variations of 5-HIAA. In the rat, behavioral stimulatory effects of low-dose benzodiazepines is evidenced with alprazolam but not lorazepam. This effect could be explained, at least in part, by increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in the striatum. Their different structures could explain the different pattern observed for the two benzodiazepines.", 
    "73": "Maternal sound stress (800 Hz; 77 dB, every other minute for 15 min/day, from day 10 to 18 of gestation), combined with forced swimming stress (15 min/day), was found to cause potentiation of sound-induced loss of locomotor activity, referred to as emotional behavior, of male offspring, but not that of female offspring, at 4 weeks of age. Maternal stress also caused an increase in the total number of errors by male, but not female offspring in the water-maze test at 6 weeks of age. These effects of stress on emotional behavior and learning behavior were abolished when dams were pretreated with buspirone (30 min before the stress, from day 8 to 18 of gestation). Thus, prenatal stress might have sex-dependent effects on emotional behavior and learning ability of neonatal rats.", 
    "74": "The existence of presynaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate autoreceptors on glutamate nerve terminals in vitro has recently been demonstrated using synaptosomal and brain slice preparations. In the present study we have used a modification of a rapid dual-label intracerebral microdialysis method, previously developed by Young and co-workers(80,81) for the study of presynaptic mechanisms of neurotransmitter release, to investigate whether presynaptic AMPA receptors also play a role in the control of striatal glutamate release in vivo. For comparative purposes, the action of locally applied AMPA on striatal GABA release in vivo was also monitored. Local application of AMPA (0.01-100 microM), by reverse dialysis, into the striatum resulted in concentration-dependent increases in the Ca(2+)-dependent efflux of both [3H]L-glutamate and [14C]GABA. Maximum responses reached 142.0+/-6.5% and 166.8+/-7.7% of basal efflux for [3H]L-glutamate and [14C]GABA, respectively. No marked behavioural changes were observed at any dose of the agonist. Unexpectedly, the AMPA-evoked responses were not potentiated by the AMPA receptor desensitization inhibitors cyclothiazide (10-100microM) or aniracetam (1mM). Consistent with this finding, AMPA-stimulated [3H]L-glutamate and [14C]GABA efflux were significantly attenuated by co-perfusion with the selective, competitive AMPA receptor antagonist 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo(F)quinoxaline-2,3-dione (100microM) but not 1-(aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (100microM), a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist known to interact with the cyclothiazide site to control AMPA receptor function. The broad spectrum ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid (100-1000microM) also markedly inhibited the AMPA-evoked responses in the striatum in vivo. None of the antagonists, when given alone, influenced basal efflux of [3H]L-glutamate suggesting a lack of tonic regulatory control of glutamate release via presynaptic AMPA-type autoreceptors in the rat striatum. These results demonstrate the presence of presynaptic AMPA receptors, of a novel cyclothiazide- and aniracetam-insensitive subtype, on presynaptic nerve terminals in the rat striatum in vivo, acting to enhance glutamate and GABA release. Our data support the concept of AMPA receptor heterogeneity in vivo, a finding which may facilitate the development of novel, more selective drugs for the treatment of a range of neurological disorders associated with abnormal cerebral glutamate release. The pharmacological profile of these novel presynaptic receptors is currently under investigation.", 
    "75": "Melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced narcosis. Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with melatonin (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg). Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis. In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate. Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced narcosis. Thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.", 
    "76": "The nature of the prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptor on cholinergic nerve endings in the rat urinary bladder was investigated by measuring stimulated endogenous acetylcholine release via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), in the presence of various selective muscarinic antagonists. The rank order of potencies for the antagonists used was: atropine (-log concentration = 7.8) > 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine) (7.6) > tripitramine (7.3) = HHD (hexahydrodifenidol) (7.3) > pFHHSiD (p-fluoro-hexahydrosiladifenidol hydrochloride) (7.0) > himbacine (6.5) > methoctramine (5.9) > or = pirenzepine (5.8) > gallamine (4.3). A comparison of the antagonist potencies obtained, with affinity constants at muscarinic M(1) to M(5) receptors, suggests that the prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptor is of the M(4) receptor subtype.", 
    "77": "Allopregnanolone (ALLO), is a brain endogenous neurosteroid that binds with high affinity to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors and positively modulates the action of GABA at these receptors. Unlike ALLO, 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone (5alpha-DHP) binds with high affinity to intracellular progesterone receptors that regulate DNA transcription. To investigate the physiological roles of ALLO and 5alpha-DHP synthesized in brain, we have adopted a mouse model involving protracted social isolation. In the frontal cortex of mice, socially isolated for 6 weeks, both neurosteroids were decreased by approximately 50%. After administration of (17beta)-17-(bis-1-methyl amino carbonyl) androstane-3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid (SKF105,111), an inhibitor of the enzyme (5alpha-reductase Type I and II) that converts progesterone into 5alpha-DHP, the ALLO and 5alpha-DHP content of frontal cortex of both group-housed and socially isolated mice decreased exponentially to 10%-20% of control values in about 30 min. The fractional rate constants (k h(-1)) of ALLO and 5alpha-DHP decline multiplied by the ALLO and 5alpha-DHP concentrations at any given steady-state estimate the rate of synthesis required to maintain that steady state. After 6 weeks of social isolation, ALLO and 5alpha-DHP biosynthesis rates were decreased to 30% of the values calculated in group-housed mice. Moreover, in socially isolated mice, the expression of 5alpha-reductase Type I mRNA and protein was approximately 50% lower than in group-housed mice whereas 3alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase mRNA expression was equal in the two groups. Protracted social isolation in mice may provide a model to investigate whether 5alpha-DHP by a genomic action, and ALLO by a nongenomic mechanism down-regulate the action of drugs acting as agonists, partial agonists, or positive allosteric modulators of the benzodiazepine recognition sites expressed by GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "78": "The pharmacological characteristics of the presynaptic muscarinic receptor subtype, which mediates inhibition of the neurogenic contractions in the prostatic portion of rabbit vas deferens, have been investigated by using a series of polymethylene tetra-amines, which were selected for their ability to differentiate among muscarinic receptor subtypes. It was found that all tetra-amines antagonized McN-A-343-induced inhibition in electrically stimulated rabbit vas deferens in a competitive manner and with affinity values (pA:(2)) ranging between 6.27+/-0.09 (spirotramine) and 8.51+/-0.02 (AM170). Competition radioligand binding studies, using native muscarinic receptors from rat tissues (M(1), cortex; M(2), heart; M(3), submaxillary gland) or from NG 108-15 cells (M(4)) and human cloned muscarinic M(1)-M(4) receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells, were undertaken with the same tetra-amines employed in functional assays. All antagonists indicated a one-site fit. The affinity estimates (pK:(i)) of tetra-amines calculated in binding assays using native receptors were similar to those obtained using cloned receptors. Among these compounds some displayed selectivity between muscarinic receptor subtypes, indicating that they may be valuable tools in receptor characterization. Spirotramine was selective for M(1) receptors versus all other subtypes (pK:(i) native: M(1), 7.32+/-0.10; M(2), 6.50+/-0.11; M(3), 6.02+/-0.13; M(4), 6.28+/-0.16; pK:(i) cloned: M(1), 7.69+/-0.08; M(2), 6.22+/-0.14; M(3), 6.11+/-0.16; 6.35+/-0.11) whereas CC8 is highly selective for M(2) receptors versus the other subtypes (pK:(i) native: M(1), 7.50+/-0.04; M(2), 9.01+/-0.12; M(3), 6.70+/-0.08; M(4), 7.56+/-0.04; pK:(i) cloned: M(1), 7.90+/-0.20; M(2), 9.04+/-0.08; M(3), 6.40+/-0.07; M(4), 7.40+/-0.04). Furthermore, particularly relevant for this investigation were tetra-amines dipitramine and AM172 for their ability to significantly differentiate M(1) and M(4) receptors. The apparent affinity values (pA:(2)) obtained for tetra-amines in functional studies using the prostatic portion of rabbit vas deferens correlated most closely with the values (pK:(i)) obtained at either native or human recombinant muscarinic M(4) receptors. This supports the view that the muscarinic receptor mediating inhibition of neurogenic contractions of rabbit vas deferens may not belong to the M(1) type but rather appears to be of the M(4) subtype.", 
    "79": "We investigated the relationship between the pharmacokinetic variables of oral midazolam and patients' state/trait anxiety and personality. Twenty-six patients received the standard 15-mg oral dose for anxiolysis on the evening before otorhinolaryngological surgery. Blood samples were taken over a 9-h period after the administration, and the samples were analyzed for concentrations of midazolam and its two main metabolites by using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry procedure. The pharmacokinetic variables maximum concentration, time to reach the maximum concentration, the elimination half-life, and the area under the curve were calculated from these data. When the patients were divided into groups with respect to their anxiety and personality scores, no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic variables of midazolam could be found. Only small, insignificant changes in the maximum concentrations were found with respect to nervousness and emotionality. We conclude that personality traits and anxiety levels had no effect on the pharmacokinetic variables of midazolam.",

    "82": "The capacity of three clinically available nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to inhibit the activity of human cytochromes P450 (CYPs) was studied in vitro using human liver microsomes. Delavirdine, nevirapine, and efavirenz produced negligible inhibition of phenacetin O-deethylation (CYP1A2) or dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6). Nevirapine did not inhibit hydroxylation of tolbutamide (CYP2C9) or S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), but these CYP isoforms were importantly inhibited by delavirdine and efavirenz. This indicates the likelihood of significantly impaired clearance of CYP2C substrate drugs (such as phenytoin, tolbutamide, and warfarin) upon initial exposure to these two NNRTIs. Delavirdine and efavirenz (but not nevirapine) also were strong inhibitors of CYP3A, consistent with clinical hazards of initial cotreatment with either of these drugs and substrates of CYP3A. The in vitro microsomal model provides relevant predictive data on probable drug interactions with NNRTIs when the mechanism is inhibition of CYP-mediated drug biotransformation. However, the model does not incorporate interactions attributable to enzyme induction.", 
    "83": "Women have a higher prevalence of GAD than do men. This ratio holds true in most clinical and general-population samples. Some variations exist, with evidence to suggest the strong impact of environment and life events. Women are sensitive to lifetime adversity and exacerbation of symptoms in conjunction with their menstrual cycle. Comorbidity is a crucial diagnostic factor when treating anyone with GAD, especially women. Most notably, high comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, MDD and alcohol-abuse disorder occurs for women. Overall, although the prevalence of women with GAD is greater than that of men with GAD, the course of illness and prognosis are not qualitatively different. Across varied methodology, data suggest gender-related differences in the metabolism and potentially in the effects and side effects of the various benzodiazepines and antidepressant psychopharmacologic treatments of GAD. Additional research is needed to better understand these differences.", 
    "84": "Children and adolescents with GAD suffer from excessive, pervasive worries that interfere with social, academic, and family functioning. The comorbidity rate with other anxiety disorders and major depression is high. The course tends to be chronic, and evidence shows continuity between anxiety disorders in youth and adulthood. Individual and group CBT and the incorporation of family anxiety management training have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of childhood GAD. No double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmacotherapy trials with adequate sample sizes for children and adolescents with GAD have been published. Preliminary data support the potential efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, buspirone, and high-potency benzodiazepines. Adequately powered, controlled, pharmacologic treatment trials are necessary. Future research should be directed toward comparing the relative efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and both in the treatment of GAD in youth.",

New antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, and the SSRIs provide an important treatment alternative to \"traditional\" anxiollytic treatments, which include the benzodiazepines, buspirone, and the TCAs; however, comparative efficacy and the effects of psychiatric comorbidity, long-term treatment, and relapse prevention are areas requiring further investigation.", 
    "86": "Neurological integrity in sick children is difficult to assess clinically. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of EEG activity recorded with a bedside EEG analysing monitor in an intensive care unit. EEG activity was monitored in 108 children (age range 2 weeks to 16 years, median 1.7 years) considered at risk for cerebral abnormalities with a cerebral function analysing monitor (CFAM). Recordings were evaluated for features of background EEG activity including mean amplitude, frequencies, and symmetry. Electrical seizure activity was quantified if present. Predictive value of the EEG features was evaluated relative to the clinical neurological outcome after one year. Asymmetrical recordings were not seen in any child with a normal outcome. Suppression of background activity was seen in 75% of the children who died. Seizures were present in 68% of children with a poor outcome. Seventeen of the 32 children (65%) who died had prolonged seizures. Absence of seizures and the presence of superimposed fast EEG activity in response to benzodiazepine infusions correlated with good outcome. A combination of two or more predictive EEG features demonstrated >90% specificity and positive predictive likelihood of poor outcome. EEG features provide information about the functional cerebral integrity of sick children. Changes in cerebral activity detected by the CFAM aid decision making by providing such information readily at the bedside in intensive care.", 
    "87": "Choice of induction agent is the decisive factor in utilization of a laryngeal mask (LM) under spontaneous respiration, as insufficient relaxation and unwanted laryngopharyngeal reflexes deteriorate the efficiency of LM functioning during operation and anesthesia. 132 anesthesias with LM were performed, 86 of these for laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCE) (group 1) and 42 for saphenectomies (group 2). Control group consisted of 60 patients anesthetized for LCE by means of an endotracheal tube (ETT). Combined induction intravenous anesthesia with ketamine, barbiturates, and diprivan was used in group 1 and controls. In group 2 induction anesthesia was based on ketamine and diprivan. Group 1 and control group were matched for demographic characteristics and concomitant diseases. All groups were divided into subgroups, depending on anesthesia. In all groups pipecuronium bromide (0.06 mg/kg) was administered before insertion of EET or LM after injection of induction agents. In total myoplegia, installation of LM was simple, involving no untoward laryngo-pharyngeal reflexes. LM was correctly installed from the first attempt in 98.7% cases. In combined intravenous ketamine-based anesthesia, pressor reaction to LM installation consisted in an increase of heart rate by 5.6% (1K group--control), by 10.2% in 2K group (fractionated ketamine (1.5-2 mg/kg) + diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2.6 micrograms/kg); after barbiturates heart rate increased by 6.7% in 1B group (control), after diprivan it did not increase in 1D group (control), while the mean arterial pressure in 2D group (fractionated diprivan (1 mg/kg) + ketamine (25-50 mg), diazepam (0.08 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2.6 micrograms/kg) increased by 10% and heart rate by 6.6%. Reaction to tracheal intubation was pronounced in all types of induction anesthesia. No regurgitation or aspiration was observed in any case. Hence, use of total myoplegia in installation of LM allows the use of various modern anesthetics in optimal doses and notably simplifies the utilization of LM.",

The medicated group received 0.2 mg x kg(-1) of injectable midazolam mixed with an equal volume of strawberry syrup and the placebo group received plain syrup 0.08 ml x kg(-1). Medications were placed on the anterosuperior aspect of the child's tongue in 3-5 aliquots of 0.2-0.4 ml.

Benzodiazepine sedative/anxiolytic drugs produce memory deficits similar to those observed in organic amnesia and may be useful tools for studying normal and abnormal memory mechanisms. The present double-blind, placebo-controlled repeated measures study examined the acute effects of orally administered triazolam (Halcion; 0.125 and 0.25 mg/70 kg), a benzodiazepine hypnotic, on performance in the Deese (1959)/Roediger-McDermott (1995) false recognition paradigm in 24 healthy volunteers. Paralleling previous demonstrations in amnesic patients, triazolam produced significant dose-related reductions in false recognition rates to nonstudied words associatively related to studied words, suggesting that false recognition relies on normal memory mechanisms impaired in benzodiazepine-induced amnesia. The results also suggested that relative to placebo, triazolam reduced participants' reliance on memory for item-specific versus list-common semantic information and reduced participants' use of remember versus know responses.", 
    "97": "The actions of trimethylolpropane phosphate (TMPP), an ethyl bicyclophosphate convulsant produced during the partial pyrolysis of some phosphate ester-based lubricants, were tested on CA1 neurons of rat hippocampal slices using intracellular recording techniques. Bath application of TMPP (0.1-100 microM) induced spontaneous paroxysmal depolarizing shifts and the associated spontaneous epileptiform bursts followed by after-hyperpolarizations in 63% of neurons tested. The TMPP-induced epileptiform bursts were blocked by muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor agonist, diazepam (DZP), a GABA(A)-benzodiazepine ionophore complex agonist, or baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist. While bath application of muscimol, DZP, or baclofen suppressed spontaneous activity in CA1 neurons not previously exposed to TMPP, subsequent application of TMPP (10 microM) reversed the actions of muscimol and diazepam, but not baclofen. TMPP (0.1-100 microM) also induced membrane hyperpolarization associated with an increase in peak input resistance and inward rectification in 33% of neurons tested or membrane depolarization associated with an increase in input resistance in 17% of neurons tested. In summary, TMPP induced epileptiform activities in hippocampal CA1 neurons. The epileptogenic effects of TMPP are consistent with its interaction with GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "98": "The atypical antipsychotics have been shown to have superior efficacy compared with typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol, particularly in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, they induce less extrapyramidal effects. However, following clinical use, marked bodyweight gain has been frequently observed with some of the atypical antipsychotic drugs. In order to examine and compare the frequency, amount and conditions of bodyweight gain during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, studies concerning bodyweight gain with these agents were identified through a MEDLINE search from 1966 to March 2000. Although comparison is limited by the different designs and recruitment procedures of the reviewed studies, the available data support the notion that the frequency as well as the amount of bodyweight gain is high in patients treated with olanzapine (average bodyweight gain 2.3 kg/month), clozapine (1.7 kg/month), quetiapine (1.8 kg/month), and possibly also zotepine (2.3 kg/month). Moderate changes in bodyweight have been observed in the treatment with risperidone (average bodyweight gain 1.0 kg/month). Ziprasidone seems to induce only slight bodyweight changes (0.8 kg/month). Bodyweight gain most frequently occurs in the first 12 weeks of treatment. Patients who were underweight at the beginning of treatment are at highest risk of gaining bodyweight. The underlying pathomechanism still remains largely unclear. The relative receptor affinities of the atypical antipsychotics for histamine H1 receptors as well as the ratio of their affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors appear to be the most robust correlate of bodyweight gain. Furthermore, the induction of leptin secretion may have an important impact on bodyweight gain in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Although many questions concerning the pathogenesis of bodyweight gain remain unresolved, this adverse effect has to be taken into consideration when prescribing the atypical antipsychotics, particularly in view its affect on compliance during long term treatment and the long term effects of obesity on mortality and morbidity.",

Treatment satisfaction ratings at follow-up were higher among patients in the injectable MMT group. The ratio for the actual medication costs between injectable and oral MMT was 6.8:1, and for the direct operational costs was 4.7:1.

    "108": "Zaleplon is a non-benzodiazepine sleep medication that shows efficacy as a sleep inducer comparable to that of other hypnotics but with significantly fewer residual effects. In addition, evaluations of psychomotor or memory function at zaleplon peak plasma levels show much less impairment than noted with other hypnotics, suggesting an improved benefit-to-risk profile for zaleplon compared with older available agents. Thus, zaleplon can be used to treat symptoms of insomnia when they occur without the concern of next-day psychomotor or memory impairment, whether administered at bedtime or later during the night. Such an approach permits physicians to reformulate their strategies for safe and effective management of sleeplessness.", 
    "109": "Sleep difficulties affect about one-third of American adults, yet these symptoms are not often addressed by patients and their physicians. Unresolved insomnia that impairs daytime function may be associated with significant psychiatric morbidity, predominantly major depression. Clinicians who are aware that these disorders frequently co-exist will be able to facilitate prompt diagnosis and initiate appropriate pharmacotherapeutic intervention. Antidepressant therapies may interfere with sleep quality; therefore, the management of insomnia in depressed patients should be addressed separately. Traditionally, benzodiazepines have been prescribed to treat sleep disturbances, but certain drugs in this class have limited benefits due to residual sedative effects that impair cognitive function, memory and general daytime performance. Zaleplon, a new, quick-acting, non-benzodiazepine sleep medication, may be clinically advantageous in promoting sleep without residual impairment.", 
    "110": "Many patients with insomnia describe their sleep problems as an inability to remain asleep throughout the night, resulting in next-day fatigue that may adversely affect daytime functioning. To be most effective, insomnia treatment should be tailored to resolving underlying causes of the condition and managing specific sleep complaints. Therefore, hypnotic therapy administered prior to bedtime, as is currently recommended for most compounds, is not appropriate for all insomnia patients. Ideally, behavioral interventions should be combined with a rapid-acting agent that can be administered at virtually any time during the night without producing residual effects the following day. Zaleplon, a new non-benzodiazepine sleep medication, provides the clinician with an effective and safe pharmacotherapeutic option for insomnia management. Its rapid rates of absorption and elimination allow for treatment of symptoms when they occur, either at bedtime or later at night, without incurring significant risk for the development of next-day impairment of psychomotor and cognitive functioning.", 
    "111": "Insomnia is common among the primary care patient population, 1.3 times more common in women than men, and the prevalence increases with age. Until recently, benzodiazepines (BZs) were the only first-line hypnotics, but with the availability of non-BZ sleep agents, the management of insomnia is changing. Zolpidem and zopiclone have adverse-effect profiles similar to BZs but lack next-day residual effects with bedtime dosing. Zaleplon is a fast-onset, rapidly eliminated medication that allows for dosing at bedtime or during the night with minimal concern for residual effects. In addition, the BZ-associated problems of tolerance and rebound effects are not evident with long-term zaleplon use. The pharmacokinetic profile of zaleplon has the potential to allow for the treatment of symptoms of sleeplessness when they occur, an approach that could replace the standard practice of always treating in anticipation of a problem.", 
    "112": "Insomnia, a common symptom throughout the world, is characterised by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or non-restorative sleep and is associated with significant morbidity. A comprehensive medical and sleep history and physical examination are necessary before treating patients with insomnia; the presence of co-morbidities, including medical and psychiatric disorders, or the possible use of substances that may contribute to sleeplessness should be thoroughly investigated. Non-pharmacological approaches include correction of sleep hygiene as well as behavioural treatments. Pharmacotherapy includes benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, which are the drugs of choice for this disorder. They can be subdivided into classic benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines. Although many agents in these classes have been prescribed, potential shortcomings include residual sedation, rebound insomnia, and psychomotor and memory impairment. Novel pharmacological strategies that address limitations of the traditional treatment approach, combined with proven modes of behavioural therapy, offer the most successful results in the management of insomnia. These advances provide the opportunity to establish these current recommendations for the optimal management of insomnia. This report from the XXII Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum Consensus Workshop outlines recommendations to serve as the foundation for developing a therapeutic plan for each patient.", 
    "113": "Putative anxiolytic activity of ethanolic extract of Indian A. pindrow Royle leaf was investigated in rats using various experimental paradigms of anxiety viz. open field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze (EPM) and elevated zero maze (EZM) tests. Pilot studies indicated that single dose administration of extract had little to no acute behavioural effects, hence the extract was administered orally at different dose levels once daily for three consecutive days, while lorazepam (LR) (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered acutely. Ethanolic extract of A. pindrow (AP) leaves (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant anxiolytic effects on all the paradigms of anxiety. The results indicate that AP and LR induced a significant increase in open field ambulation and slight increase in rearings and activity in center, whereas grooming and faecal droppings remain unchanged. In EPM, significant augmentation of open arm entries, and time spent on open arms was noted in AP treated rats. In EZM test, significant increase in time spent on open arms and entries in open arms was observed, whereas slight increase in head dips and stretched attend postures was also observed. The AP extract showed consistent and significant anxiolytic activity in all the tests. The effects induced by ethanolic extract of AP were less marked than those of lorazepam were.", 
    "114": "L-Deprenyl (Selegeline) introduced for use in parkinson's disease, is implicated to show beneficial effects in epilepsy, alzheimer's disease, cognition, depression and other age related neurological diseases. In this study, we investigated the CNS effects of L-deprenyl with special reference to epilepsy, anxiety and cognition and memory in mice. L-deprenyl (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) showed a significant anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions. Combination of L-deprenyl (10 mg/kg) with the sub-protective dose of diazepam (1 mg/kg) showed potentiation of the anticonvulsant effect. In the maximal-electroshock (MES)-induced convulsions, L-deprenyl (10 mg/kg) significantly delayed the onset and decreased the duration of extensor phase. Its combination with the lower dose of phenytoin (10 mg/kg) showed potentiation in response compared to the per se effect of both the drugs. However, L-deprenyl did not show any protective effect in lithium-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. Acute treatment with L-deprenyl had no effect on learning and memory. In chronic treatment, L-deprenyl per se showed no effect on learning and memory but did improve the condition in mice with scopolamine induced memory deficit. L-Deprenyl per se was anxiogenic though in combination with diazepam (1 mg/kg) it potentiated the antianxiety effect of the latter. The above observations suggest that in epilepsy, L-deprenyl might be acting partially by influencing the GABAA/benzodiazepine mechanism in the brain (similar to diazepam and phenytoin), and in cognition enhancing effect, the cholinergic system might be playing a role. Thus, L-deprenyl could prove to be an adjuvant in the antiepileptic therapy and beneficial in dementia associated with epilepsy.",

There seems to be som reluctance to treat these patients with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Upon request, the Drug Information Centre in Odense made an extensive literature search on the subject. No documentation was found that tramadol additionally depresses the respiration in patients with COPD, nor has oxazepam in clinically relevant doses been found to exacerbate their lung disease. The clinical effect is subject to large interindividual variability, and the use of these drugs should, to a greater extent, rest on experience with the individual patient. There seems to be no reason to maintain a priori this rigoristic reluctance to use tramadol and/or oxazepam in patients with COPD.",

Some of the compounds exhibited regulatory activities in the proliferative response of cells to PHA depending on the reactivity of cells to PHA.

A range of treatments, from scaling to root canal therapy, can be carried out successfully using the sedation technique outlined. The advantages of sedation include reduced morbidity and mortality. Treatment outcomes are also likely to be improved as root canal therapy and periodontal care can be carried out over a number of visits rather than a single treatment session under general anaesthesia. Oral sedation with midazolam should improve the scope of dental treatment available to patients with disabilities.",

    "123": "Rats were trained, under a two-lever drug-discrimination procedure, to respond differentially depending upon whether lorazepam (1.0 mg/kg) or no injection had been administered before the session. Responses on the appropriate lever produced a food pellet under a modified fixed-ratio (FR) 10 schedule, in which the 10 responses had to be emitted consecutively. In reinforcement tests, completing an FR 10 on either lever produced a pellet. In extinction tests, stimulus changes paired with reinforcement occurred but no pellet was delivered. Training sessions were conducted between test sessions. Each of four extinction phases consisted of six tests preceded by one stimulus (e.g., lorazepam). Repeated exposures to extinction reduced response rates for all rats, but stimulus control, as inferred from either percentage of total responses or percentage of total FR 10s on the drug-appropriate lever, remained high. The percentage of total FR 10s measure was less subject to skewing under low-rate conditions than was the percentage of total responses measure and provided an evaluation of stimulus control in terms of meeting the consecutive response contingency. These results demonstrate a level of independence between response rate and stimulus control in drug discrimination, which has positive implications for the validity of interpreting discriminative effects of novel test conditions in well-trained animals, even when overall response rates are low.", 
    "124": "Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is a second generation (atypical) antipsychotic agent which has proven efficacy against the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Compared with conventional antipsychotics, it has greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A than for dopamine D2 receptors. In large, well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses, olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day was significantly superior to haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/day in overall improvements in psychopathology rating scales and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptoms, and was comparable in effects on positive psychotic symptoms. The 1-year risk of relapse (rehospitalisation) was significantly lower with olanzapine than with haloperidol treatment. In the first double-blind comparative study (28-week) of olanzapine and risperidone, olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day proved to be significantly more effective than risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms but not on overall psychopathology symptoms. In contrast, preliminary results from an 8-week controlled study suggested risperidone 2 to 6 mg/day was superior to olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms (p < 0.05), although consistent with the first study, both agents demonstrated similar efficacy on measures of overall psychopathology. Improvements in general cognitive function seen with olanzapine treatment in a 1-year controlled study of patients with early-phase schizophrenia, were significantly greater than changes seen with either risperidone or haloperidol. However, preliminary results from an 8-week trial showed comparable cognitive enhancing effects of olanzapine and risperidone treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Several studies indicate that olanzapine has benefits against symptoms of aggression and agitation, while other studies strongly support the effectiveness of olanzapine in the treatment of depressive symptomatology. Olanzapine is associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol and risperidone. In addition, olanzapine is not associated with a risk of agranulocytosis as seen with clozapine or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as seen with risperidone or prolongation of the QT interval. The most common adverse effects reported with olanzapine are bodyweight gain, somnolence, dizziness, anticholinergic effects (constipation and dry mouth) and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations. In comparison with haloperidol, the adverse events reported significantly more frequently with olanzapine in > or = 3.5% of patients were dry mouth, bodyweight gain and increased appetite and compared with risperidone, only bodyweight gain occurred significantly more frequently with olanzapine. The high acquisition cost of olanzapine is offset by reductions in other treatment costs (inpatient and/or outpatient services) of schizophrenia. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that olanzapine does not significantly increase, and may even decrease, the overall direct treatment costs of schizophrenia, compared with haloperidol. Compared with risperidone, olanzapine has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs, despite the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug. Olanzapine treatment improves quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses to a greater extent than haloperidol, and to broadly the same extent as risperidone.", 
    "125": "Olanzapine demonstrated superior antipsychotic efficacy compared with haloperidol in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia, and in the treatment of some patients with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The reduced risk of adverse events and therapeutic superiority compared with haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms support the choice of olanzapine as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response.", 
    "126": "Hypersensitivity syndrome is defined as a drug-induced complex of symptoms consisting of fever, rash, and internal organ involvement. The hypersensitivity syndrome is well recognized as being caused by anticonvulsants. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent whose side effects include sedation, weight gain, and increased creatinine kinase and transaminase levels. To date, there have been no reports of hypersensitivity syndrome related to this drug. A 34-year-old man developed a severe generalized pruritic skin eruption, fever, eosinophilia, and toxic hepatitis 60 days after ingestion of olanzapine. After termination of olanzapine treatment, the fever resolved, the skin rash was reduced, eosinophil count was reduced to normal, and the transaminase levels were markedly reduced. Clinical features and the results of skin and liver biopsies indicated that the patient developed hypersensitivity syndrome caused by olanzapine.",

    "128": "To characterize the mechanisms of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasorelaxation in rabbit renal arteries precontracted with high K+ (100 mM), muscle tension and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were measured simultaneously in the fura-2-loaded arterial strips. In the artery with endothelium, high K+ increased both [Ca2+]i and muscle tension. Addition of ACh (10 microM) during high-K+ induced contraction significantly relaxed the muscle and induced additional increase in [Ca2+]i. In the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME, 0.1 mM). ACh increased [Ca2+]i without relaxing the muscle. In the artery without endothelium, high K+ increased both [Ca2+]i and muscle tension although ACh was ineffective, suggesting that ACh acts selectively on endothelium to increase [Ca2+]i. 4-DAMP (10 nM) or atropine (0.1 microM) abolished the ACh-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and relaxation. However, pirenzepine (0.1 microM), AF-DX 116 (1 microM) and tropicamide (1 microM) were ineffective. The ACh-induced increase of [Ca2+li and vasorelaxation was significantly reduced by 3 microM gadolinium, 10 microM lanthanum or 10 microM SKF 96365. These results suggest that, in rabbit renal artery, ACh-evoked relaxation of 100 mM K+-induced contractions is mediated by the release of endothelial NO. ACh may stimulates the M3 subtype of muscarinic receptor in the endothelial cells, resulting in the opening of the nonselective cation channels followed by an increase of [Ca2+]i and stimulation of NO synthase.", 
    "129": "The benzodiazepine receptor (peripheral) (BZRP) mainly localized on glial cells plays a role in neurosteroid synthesis, and increases with glial proliferation. We have recently reported a significant decrease in the density of BZRP labeled by [3H] PK 11195 in the postmortem brain of chronic schizophrenics, suggesting that dysfunctions of the BZRP are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We screened 11 patients with schizophrenia and 10 controls, which were used in a previous postmortem study, for their genomic sequences of the BZRP gene in order to find DNA sequence variations. One novel missense polymorphism (His162Arg) and another previously reported missense mutation (Ala147Thr) were detected. An association study of the identified variations was then performed in an extended Japanese sample of 304 schizophrenic patients and 369 controls. While there was an increased tendency in the frequency of the 162Arg allele of schizophrenics compared to that of the controls (p = 0.0603), no statistically significant association with schizophrenia was observed in the Ala147Thr allele (p = 0.1016). These results do not suggest that the two missense polymorphisms play a major role in the genetic predisposition of schizophrenia in the Japanese sample.", 
    "130": "The discrimination of poisoning from other conditions is essential. When multiple patients with similar clinical findings are seen, deliberate poisoning should be considered along with the possibility of resulting from accidental food poisoning, infection, diseases resulting from extreme circumstances, and mass hysteria. The diagnosis of causal poisoning chemicals based on clinical findings is essential. Breath odors, findings of vomitus, skin color, body temperature, autonomic nervous system findings, and seizures are important physical findings. On the other hand, laboratory findings such as ECG abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, increased serum hepatic enzyme levels, and increased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are also useful in obtaining the correct diagnosis. X-ray films are useful in demonstrating several types of radiopaque drugs in the stomach. Rapid tests are valuable in diagnosing poisoning caused by such chemicals as paraquat and cyanides. Therapeutic diagnoses obtained by administering competitive blockers of specific receptors are also valuable when benzodiazepine or opiate poisoning is suspected. The final diagnosis of the causal chemical should be based on both the clinical findings and analytical results.",

The common carotid artery was cannulated to measure arterial blood pressure because arteries in extremities were not available. Internal jugular vein at the other side of the arterial catheterization was cannulated to measure central venous pressure. Crystalloid and blood transfusion was performed to adjust hemodynamics and central venous pressure. Hemodynamics were stable during surgery and no complication occurred regarding the common carotid arterial line. The common carotid artery was useful for blood pressure monitoring in a patient whose extremities were not available. Midazolam and fentanyl could give stable hemodynamics to a patient with arteriosclerosis obliterans and chronic renal failure.", 
    "132": "Four patients affected by severe Parkinson's disease developed leucopenia (900-1200 WBC) during treatment of psychosis (3) or untreatable insomnia (1) with clozapine (37.5-75 mg/day). Clozapine withdrawal was followed by recovery of leucopenia (4000-6000 WBC) in two weeks with no need for the administration of leucokines. After 1-6 months olanzapine was administered (increasing the dose from 2.5 to 10 mg/day) to treat persisting disturbances, but the drug induced severe worsening of parkinsonism and also this drug had to be withdrawn.", 
    "133": "A 27-year-old man was admitted with tremulousness, diaphoresis, tachypnea (28 breaths/min), full-body rigidity, irritability, paranoia, and auditory and visual hallucinations 2 days after stopping long-term gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and 8 hours after stopping alcohol intake. He received intravenous fluids and tapering dosages of lorazepam to control agitation and rigidity, and recovered with no significant sequelae after 8 days. Abrupt cessation of GHB after high-dosage abuse can precipitate a clinically significant withdrawal syndrome. Lorazepam should be considered for treatment of GHB withdrawal. Concomitant alcohol abuse may mask early GHB withdrawal symptoms and exacerbate withdrawal.", 
    "134": "The possible analgesic effect of melatonin was investigated in young male ICR mice. The formalin test which elicits typically 2 phases of pain response, the acute (first) phase and tonic (second) phase, was used. The test was performed in the late light period when the mice have been reported to be more sensitive to pain. Compared to control mice, no significant difference in nociceptive response was observed when melatonin was injected intraperitoneally at doses of 0.1, 5, and 20, mg/kg body weight. The combined effects of melatonin with diazepam and/or morphine, were also investigated. Melatonin, injected at 20 mg/kg 15 min before formalin test, significantly increased the antinociceptive response of diazepam (1 mg/kg) or morphine (5 mg/kg) in the second phase. In addition, when melatonin was given at 20 mg/kg together with diazepam and morphine, antinociceptive responses in both the first and second phase were increased. These data indicate the synergistic analgesia effect of melatonin with morphine and diazepam and suggest the possible involvement of melatonin as an adjunct medicine for pain patients.", 
    "135": "To assess the consequences to mother and baby of abruptly discontinuing antidepressant or benzodiazepine medication during pregnancy and to assess the impact of our counselling.", 
    "136": "All women who consulted the Motherisk Program between November 1996 and December 1997 and who stopped taking antidepressant or benzodiazepine medication when pregnancy was confirmed agreed to participate in the study.", 
    "137": "Subjects were interviewed, received counselling, and completed a questionnaire 1 month after their initial call and after the birth of their baby.", 
    "138": "Of 36 women who completed the study, 34 discontinued their medication abruptly for fear of harming the fetus, 28 on the advice of their physician; 26 (70.3%) women reported physical and psychological adverse effects, 11 reported psychological effects only, and 11 reported suicidal ideation (4 were admitted to hospital). After counselling, 22 of 36 (61.1%) women resumed taking their medication, and 4 found that they no longer required it. One woman had a therapeutic abortion and 2 experienced spontaneous abortions; there were therefore 35 healthy babies (including 2 sets of twins) born to 33 women; 14 of 21 mothers breast-fed their babies while taking their psychotropic medication, with no adverse effects reported.", 
    "139": "When assessing the risks and benefits of taking psychotropic medication during pregnancy, women and their physicians should be aware that the abrupt discontinuation of psychotropic drugs can lead to serious adverse effects. Counselling is effective in reassuring women to adhere to therapy.", 
    "140": "To outline current approaches to diagnosing and managing delirium in the elderly.", 
    "141": "A literature review was based on a MEDLINE search (1966 to 1998). Selected articles were reviewed and used as the basis for discussion of diagnosis and etiology. We planned to include all published randomized controlled trials regarding management but found only two. Consequently, we also used review articles and recent practice guidelines for delirium published by the American Psychiatric Association.", 
    "142": "Clinical diagnosis of delirium can be aided by using DSM-IV criteria, the Delirium Symptom Interview, or the confusion assessment method. Management must include investigation and treatment of underlying causes and general supportive measures. Providing optimal levels of stimulation, reorienting patients, education, and supporting families are important. Pharmacologic management of delirium should be considered only for specific symptoms or behaviours, e.g., aggression, severe agitation, or psychosis. Only one randomized controlled trial of tranquilizer use for delirium in medically ill people has been published. Findings support the current belief that neuroleptics are superior to benzodiazepines in most cases of delirium. Most authorities still consider haloperidol the neuroleptic of choice. Controlled trials of the new atypical neuroleptics for treating delirium are not yet available. Benzodiazepines with relatively short half-lives, such as lorazepam, are the drugs of choice for withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "143": "Delirium is frequently underdiagnosed in clinical practice. It should be suspected with acute changes in behaviour. Careful investigation of the underlying cause permits appropriate management.", 
    "144": "The solid-phase synthesis of biologically important pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11-diones using Wang resin through amide formation and reductive cyclization procedures is described. Further, N10-substituents have been introduced in the final products and these have been cleaved from the solid support in good yields.", 
    "145": "Five coumestans with different patterns of oxygenation in rings A and D were synthesized from resorcinol and aromatic aldehydes, and screened for their antimyotoxic activity. The most potent compound (2b, IC50 = 1 microM) was selected for study of its pharmacological profile.", 
    "146": "The adsorption of four drugs with certain toxicity, i.e. chlorpromazine, quinidine, diazepam and phenobarbital on attapulgite and Cross-linked Agar Beads Entrapped Attapulgite(CAA) was determined in this study. The results revealed that attapulgite possessed high adsorption for the cation drugs(chlorpromazine and quinidine), moderate adsorption for diazepam, and slight adsorption for phenobabital. The adsorption in attapulgite was quite quick and came to equilibrium in about 30 min. No significant difference(P > 0.05) of adsorption on attapulgite was observed at 30 min and 60 min. The adsorbent selectivity on CAA was the same as that on attapulgite. The speed of the adsorption was slower on CAA than on attapulgite, but the quantity adsorpted on CAA and that on attapulgite had no marked difference(P > 0.05) after 60 min. CAA preserved the adsorption property of attapulgite fundamentally. CAA overcame the dispersibility of attapulgite distinctly and showed good hemocompatibility and a fair blood flow rate in hemoperfusion. It may play an important role in the separation of blood components and in hemopurification."
