Not only did chlordiazepoxide produce a paradoxical dose-dependent increase in the duration of tonic immobility, but birds treated with chlordiazepoxide showed significantly enhanced shock-termination thresholds. Using two separate tolerance paradigms, the enhancement due to chlordiazepoxide was shown to be independent of the sedative and/or muscle relaxant effects of the drug. These findings have interesting implications for the supposed anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepines and the relationship between fear and serotonin in avian species.", 
    "1": "Two beta-carbolines, methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE), caused the parallel shift of the dose-response curve for cholecystokinin (CCK) in isolated guinea-pig gallbladder muscle. The Schild plot regarding the parallel shift in the dose-response curves had a regression line with a slope of 1.03 and a pA2 value of 5.17 for beta-CCE, while the method of van Rossum gave a pA2 value of 5.24 for beta-CCE and 5.53 for beta-CCM. Both the beta-carbolines protected CCK receptors in the gallbladder muscle from alkylation by dibenamine, but beta-CCM did not protect acetylcholine receptors from dibenamine alkylation. These results suggest that beta-CCM and beta-CCE, so-called inverse agonists of benzodiazepines (BZP), antagonize the CCK action in the gallbladder muscle in a competitive manner, and the antagonism takes place at CCK receptor sites. No spare receptors for CCK were found in the guinea-pig gallbladder muscle.", 
    "2": "The techniques used to analyse 212 \"under-the-limit\" drink-driving blood and urine specimens for drugs during a 3-year period (1982-85) in Northern Ireland are described. In all of these specimens (representing 15% of all below-limit cases) either the police surgeon who carried out the clinical examination, or the police, strongly suspected that drugs may have been a contributory factor in driving impairment, considering the lower than expected alcohol concentration. Thirty-eight (18%) samples were found to contain significant drug(s). Benzodiazepines were the most frequently encountered group of drugs (87% of all positive cases) with diazepam being that most frequently encountered (18 cases). The analytical procedures were radioimmunoassay, gas chromatography using nitrogen selective and electron capture detection along with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultra-violet detection. Drugs and their metabolites were identified using a mixture of these techniques along with GC/MS where possible. The usefulness of HPLC coupled with a rapid-scanning diode-array spectrophotometer is also demonstrated, the technique being particularly useful in the analysis of some of the more \"difficult\" benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam, temazepam, nitrazepam) not directly amenable to gas chromatography without derivatisation.", 
    "3": "Corticosteroids and cytostatic drugs possess a documented lesive action on upper digestive mucosa, making epigastric pain and/or pyrosis common complaints among patients on antitumor treatment. The selective antimuscarinic pirenzepine and the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine were tested against the ulcerogenic action of antiblastic chemotherapy. Thirty-eight patients affected with malignant lymphoproliferative disorders were endoscopically examined and the endoscopic pictures were quantified by using an arbitrary score. According to a double-blind randomized sequence, 19 out of the 38 patients received pirenzepine 100 mg/die/p.o. and the other 19 received ranitidine 300 mg/die/p.o. along with antitumoral therapy for periods of 3-6 months. Seven patients died of hematologic complications before ending the treatment. In the 31 surviving patients (13 pirenzepine- and 18 ranitidine-treated) a second endoscopic examination was performed at the end of the treatment and the lesion score repeated. No significant difference was found between initial and final scores in both groups. The antisecretive action of the two drugs may account for their effectiveness, but other mechanisms such as cytoprotection cannot be ruled out.", 
    "4": "We studied the effect of concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide on the negative chronotropic effect of metoprolol in rabbits. Chlordiazepoxide administration for more than two weeks partly reversed the effect of metoprolol in three out of five rabbits, probably through hepatic enzyme induction.", 
    "5": "Withdrawal from chronic ethanol intake results in a syndrome of tremor and hyperexcitability, which can progress to seizures and death. Drugs used therapeutically to alleviate the syndrome have sedative actions and dependence liability of their own. The basis of the syndrome is unclear, although ethanol affects many neuronal functions, including membrane calcium conductance. Calcium channel blocking drugs have been used in cardiovascular disorders; they bind to high affinity sites in the brain but have few overt actions on the central nervous system. We have tested the effects of four calcium channel antagonists on the ethanol withdrawal syndrome in rats. Nitrendipine and nimodipine abolished all spontaneous seizures and prevented or reduced seizures following an audiogenic stimulus, and mortality. Verapamil significantly decreased seizure incidence and both it and flunarizine lowered mortality. The dihydropyridines were considerably more effective than diazepam in the withdrawal syndrome but had little effect on pentylenetetrazol seizures, against which diazepam gave good protection. The calcium channel inhibitors showed no sedative activity in normal animals. The results provide evidence that alterations in calcium conductance may be involved in the ethanol withdrawal syndrome and offer possibilities for the development of non-sedative therapeutic treatment of this syndrome.", 
    "6": "The molecular mechanics program AMBER, assisted by CHEMLAB II, was used to model the covalent and noncovalent binding of anthramycin, tomaymycin, and neothramycin A to the hexanucleotide conformation. Structures covalently bonded at N2 of guanine gave excellent fits when placed in either direction in the minor groove. However, energy analysis showed a preference for the direction wherein the side chain points toward the 5' end of the covalently bound strand. This preference agrees with published NMR studies. Noncovalent binding of anthramycin in the minor groove near guanine gave good fits with almost no distortion in the helix, and the reactive center of the ligand was close enough to N2 for subsequent covalent bond formation. Anthramycin also gave a good noncovalent complex near adenine in the minor groove, but binding in the major groove had decreased dispersion attractions. Binding of tomaymycin was similar to that of anthramycin, although the smaller size of tomaymycin resulted in less binding energy. Neothramycin noncovalent binding was characterized by strong electrostatic interactions, partly involving the 3-OH group, and by part of the molecule lying outside the minor groove. AMBER was used for the exploratory design of an anthramycin analogue that theoretically would bind as well as anthramycin but not cause cardiotoxicity. A related study involving anthramycin, tomaymycin, and the pentanucleotide duplex d(AAGAA/TTCTT) was undertaken to evaluate further the ability of AMBER to predict sequence specificity. It indicated a preferred direction of binding toward 5' in the minor groove of the duplex, but rather weak interaction with the noncovalently bound strand. This prediction agreed with experiments on tomaymycin that showed separation of the duplex and alignment of the drug toward the 5' end of the covalently bound strand.", 
    "7": "We present molecular mechanics simulation of the covalent interactions of the potent antitumor antibiotic belonging to the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine class, anthramycin, with six deoxydecanucleotides, d(GCGCGCGCGC)2, d(G10) X d(C10), d(GCGCGTGCGC) X d(GCGCACGCGC), d(GCGCGAGCGC) X d(GCGCTCGCGC), d(GGGGGAGGGG) X d(CCCCTCCCCC), and d(GGGGGTGGGG) X d(CCCCACCCCC), in their minor grooves. The complexes are characterized by both a network of hydrogen bonds between the drug and the polynucleotide and good packing interactions. The DNA double helix in these complexes shows very minimal distortion, and interactions of the drug with the decanucleotides seem to be not very sensitive to the sequence variation around the site of complex formation. The conformational features in the complexes obtained are generally consistent with the experimentally derived conclusions by recent NMR and 2-D NOE studies.", 
    "8": "As a new approach to the functional alteration of kindled epileptogenic foci, we have demonstrated electroencephalographic (EEG) changes at the site of stimulation at the times when the kindling stimulation is applied in freely moving rats. In the kindled amygdala, three components of response were observed: an initial evoked potential, a subsequent EEG suppression, and an eventual burst of rhythmic spiking. The three components were a common feature also in the kindled hippocampus and prepyriform region. The duration of component 2, EEG suppression, progressively increased with each day of kindling (40 to 50 days), but dramatically shortened again after a rest period of 1 month. It was sensitive to pharmacological manipulations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The amplitude of component 3, rhythmic spiking, increased during kindling, and was relatively insensitive to current intensities. The increased amplitude was long-lasting, independent of GABAergic, monoaminergic, and cholinergic manipulations, but sensitive to a benzodiazepine. It is suggested that component 3 is the outbreak of synchronous excitatory action which may be related to the basic mechanism of kindling.", 
    "9": "To evaluate the efficacy of a mild anxiolytic, alprazolam, in relieving dyspnea, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study on patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Twenty-four patients had alprazolam (0.5 mg bid) or placebo administered for one week, followed by placebo for one week, then either placebo or alprazolam for the third week. Assessment tests were performed at the outset, end of the first and second weeks, and finally end of the third week. The parameters measured were: pulmonary function, exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer, and the distance covered in a 12 minute walk. Subjective sensations of dyspnea at rest and during guarded exercise, as well as subjective feelings of calmness or anxiety were also recorded. There was no difference in mechanical lung function, but the PO2 tended to decrease and PCO2 to increase after alprazolam administration. The maximum exercise level attained and the distance covered in the 12 minute walk was unchanged. The subjective perception of dyspnea was the same before and after alprazolam, at rest and during exercise. We conclude that alprazolam is not effective in relieving exercise dyspnea in patients with obstructive lung disease.", 
    "10": "The combined effects on performance of two anxiolytics with different mechanisms of action were evaluated double-blind and crossover in 12 healthy students. Objective (tracking, divided attention, Maddox wing, etc.) and subjective (visual analogue scales and questionnaires) tests were done before and twice after single oral doses. Diazepam (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) impaired performance dose relatedly and rendered the subjects drowsy, calm, mentally slow, and clumsy. Buspirone (15 mg) proved inactive in objective tests but matched diazepam (0.30 mg/kg) subjectively. In combinations, buspirone added to the effects of diazepam in Maddox wing and letter cancellation but tended to counteract diazepam effects on divided attention and learning acquisition. Subjectively buspirone prolonged diazepam-induced sedation. Increased calmness caused by diazepam was not affected by concomitant buspirone. It is suggested that combining small doses of buspirone to diazepam does not cause any additional decrement in psychomotor performance. Possible advantages of the diazepam-buspirone combination in therapeutic use are discussed.", 
    "11": "The muscarinic receptor for acetylcholine shows a diversity in ligand binding properties and effector mechanisms which have suggested the existence of two subtypes (M1 and M2), to which the selective antagonist pirenzepine binds with markedly different affinities. The receptor from rat brain, covalently labelled with the alkylating antagonist tritiated propylbenzilylcholine mustard, displays a structural microheterogeneity on electrophoresis, covering the region of apparent molecular weight 66,000-76,000, with dominant components at 68,000 and 73,000. Selective inhibition by pirenzepine of labelling of the M1 receptor with tritiated mustard has been analysed on fluorographs of sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels and shown to cause a uniform reduction in radioactive labelling of the broad receptor peak, rather than selectively inhibiting either the high- or low-molecular-weight regions of the band. It is further shown that although this receptor microheterogeneity is found for each of four brain regions studied, it is not found for the heart receptor, which gives a discrete labelled band of apparent molecular weight 72,000. It is therefore suggested that the structural microheterogeneity is the result of tissue-specific, posttranslational modification of the molecule, such as glycosylation, and is not directly related to the functional diversity of the receptor.", 
    "12": "The frontal midline theta activity which appears during a performance of mental tasks has been designated as Fm theta. Sixteen male university students who showed the appearance of Fm theta in 3 consecutive days were given 4 centrally acting drugs, i.e., diazepam 5 mg, amobarbital 80 mg, methylphenidate 15 mg and placebo, in a double-blind, crossover design. Scores were made on the state anxiety scale of Spielberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and EEGs were recorded monopolarly before and during the performance of an arithmetic addition. The test was done twice, before and one hour after the drug administration. Placebo increased the appearance time of Fm theta, decreased the STAI scores and increased the tasks. Diazepam increased the appearance of Fm theta and decreased the state of anxiety but did not influence the amount of tasks. Amobarbital changed neither the appearance of Fm theta nor STAI scores but decreased the tasks slightly. Methylphenidate failed to influence the appearance of Fm theta but increased both the STAI scores and performed tasks. These results suggest that the appearance of Fm theta is influenced by the drugs and that the relief from anxiety might be involved in the appearance of Fm theta.", 
    "13": "The kinetics of a single 0.5 mg oral dose of the triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam, were studied in 54 healthy young men aged 20-44 years, with a mean body weight of 77 kg. Triazolam kinetics were determined from multiple plasma concentrations measured during 14 h post-dose. The overall mean +/- s.e. mean (with range) kinetic variables were: peak plasma concentration, 4.4 +/- 0.3 (1.7-9.4) ng ml-1; time of peak, 1.3 +/- 0.1 (0.5-4.0) h after dose; elimination half-life, 2.6 +/- 0.1 (1.1-4.4) h; total AUC: 19.1 +/- 1.1 (4.4-47.7) ng ml-1 h; oral clearance, 526 +/- 38 (175-1892) ml min-1. All kinetic variables were consistent with Poisson distributions, based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit test. None of the variables fit normal distributions. Four of five were consistent with a log normal distribution. Peak plasma level was highly correlated with clearance (r = -0.85, P less than 0.0001), and AUC (r = 0.85, P less than 0.0001) but not with body weight (r = 0.21, NS). Clearance and body weight were not correlated (r = -0.01). Triazolam clearance may vary widely even within a homogeneous group of healthy young men.", 
    "14": "The effect of glycine on the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam and phenobarbital in fully developed kindled amygdaloid seizures in rats was determined. Glycine alone had no significant effect on the seizure response, either when administered orally 1 hr prior to the seizure test or when given chronically in a 0.5 M solution as the source of water. Administration of glycine (10 mmol/kg, oral) together with diazepam produced a significant reduction in both cortical epileptiform afterdischarge and the severity of seizures at doses of diazepam which had no significant effect on the seizures when administered alone. Glycine potentiated the effects of phenobarbital on the cortical afterdischarge but not the severity of the seizures. The observed potentiation of the effects of diazepam and phenobarbital suggests a glycinergic mechanism in the anticonvulsant action of these drugs which may be mediated in part by the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems.", 
    "15": "A double-blind controlled study comparing the effects of intravenous Diazemuls (0.15 mg kg-1) with midazolam (0.07 mg kg-1) in patients with normal liver function and with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is described. The clinical effect of the two drugs was assessed by serial tests of psychomotor function before and at varying intervals after administration. Using this dosage regime, midazolam caused significantly greater impairment in psychomotor function in both cirrhotic and non cirrhotic subjects, and the time taken for recovery of normal function was also significantly prolonged. Patients with cirrhosis showed a significantly prolonged recovery time following administration of either benzodiazepine compared with the controls. Administration of midazolam in a lower dose might reduce the degree of sedation and shorten the recovery time, but this could also lead to a loss of some of the amnesic effect. Caution is recommended in the administration of benzodiazepines to patients with cirrhosis.", 
    "16": "20 patients scheduled for cataract extraction were randomly assigned to two groups. Before anaesthesia was induced, group A patients received 0.3 mg/kg body weight diazepam, whereas group B was given 0.15 mg/kg body weight midazolam. The ocular pressure, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate were determined and a capillary blood gas analysis was performed prior to the administration of the tranquilizer (time I), after the patient fell asleep (time II) as well as 5 min. after intubation (time III). Before intubation the patients received fentanyl and succinylcholin. The reduction in ocular pressure is initially somewhat less in the midazolam group, but is identical to that in the diazepam group at time III where it fell to 57% of the preinduction value. In combination with fentanyl, these two drugs are suitable for anaesthesia in intraocular surgery.", 
    "17": "Transdermal scopolamine has already proved an effective premedication to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. In a double-blind study, the effects and above all the side effects of TTS-scopolamine (TTS-s) and TTS-placebo (TTS-p) were investigated in elderly patients (greater than 50 years), who are particularly susceptible to adverse drug reactions. The 59 (out of 61) male and female patients who could finally be evaluated had to undergo long (1-6.3 hrs.) surgical or gynaecological interventions in general anaesthesia after premedication with benzodiazepines in the evening and in the morning. The operations were performed under intubation anaesthesia induced by barbiturate (3-5 mg/kg bw) or etomidate (0.2-0.3 mg/kg bw), together with enflurane (0.5-2.5 vol.%) or isoflurane (0.5-1.5 vol.%), N2O/O2 (2:1) and fentanyl (0.05-0.45 mg). Alcuronium or vecuronium were given for relaxation, pyridostigmine/atropine was administered for antagonisation. The patient groups did not differ significantly with regard to age (mean = 65 years vs. 63 years), sex, height, weight, concomitant diseases, method and duration of operation, method and duration of anaesthesia, postoperative antagonisation and analgesia. In patients under TTS-s postoperative nausea was less intensive and of shorter duration. In contrast to 7 patients of the placebo group (p less than 0.05), no case of vomiting could be observed in the TTS-s group. The efficacy of TTS-s was significantly better than that of TTS-p. TTS-s and TTS-p were both tolerated equally well. In both groups, the most frequent side effect was dryness of the mouth, but without any significant differences between the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Previously published studies investigating the oral benzodiazepine ethanol interaction have utilized a single dose of ethanol, a single dose of oral benzodiazepine, and measured plasma benzodiazepine concentration over varying time periods. Most studies reported an increase or no change in benzodiazepine plasma concentrations following ethanol administration, which the investigators usually ascribed to an ethanol-induced increase in the benzodiazepine absorption rate constant. However, ethanol decreases the hepatic clearance of benzodiazepines that are biotransformed via the P450 enzyme system and this effect was not taken into account in evaluation of the results of these studies. Computer simulations have been used to investigate possible mechanisms of the oral benzodiazepine-ethanol interaction. The effects of a constant or transient decrease in clearance and an increase in absorption rate constant upon maximum concentration, time of maximum concentration, and area under the benzodiazepine plasma concentration curve (AUC) have been examined. A transient 75% decrease in benzodiazepine clearance resulted in a 13.6% increase in AUC (0-36 hr), a 3.4% increase in Cmax and a 5.7% increase in tmax. These changes are qualitatively consistent with, but quantitatively shy, of those observed in most studies. Consequently, an effect of ethanol upon benzodiazepine absorption must still be considered.", 
    "19": "The efficacy of 50 mg pirenzepine twice daily in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis was compared with that of placebo in 47 patients over a period of 12 weeks. The 23 patients receiving pirenzepine experienced decreases in symptoms after 4 weeks (p less than 0.001) and 12 weeks (p less than 0.02) of treatment significantly greater than those in the 24 patients receiving placebo. The decreases in symptoms were associated with significantly less use of antacids by the pirenzepine group (p less than 0.01) during the first 4 weeks. Endoscopically, oesophagitis was healed or improved in 54.5% of patients receiving pirenzepine and in 18.2% of patients receiving placebo (p less than 0.05) after 4 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks of treatment healing or improvement was seen in 55.0% and 35.0% of patients, respectively (difference not significant). Histologic improvement did not differ significantly between the groups. Our results suggest that pirenzepine is useful in the management of reflux oesophagitis.", 
    "20": "A simple, inexpensive and reliable microcomputer-assisted method to detect and quantify abnormal EEG spiking is described. High frequency wave forms (20-40 Hz) with high amplitude are discriminated using a beta-2 bandpass filter and a threshold comparater. The spikes are then compiled and reported by an Apple II+ microcomputer. The method was validated by measuring seizures generated by intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), by microinjection of excitatory amino acids into the dorsal hippocampus, and by the antagonism of these seizures by diazepam and 2-amino-7-phosphono heptanoic acid, respectively.", 
    "21": "Chlordiazepoxide-amitriptyline (Limbitrol) has been shown to be more rapidly effective than amitriptyline alone for treating depression. A double-blind, randomized study was designed to compare the effects of Limbitrol and amitriptyline on insomnia, anxiety, and depression. The rate of improvement of symptoms was faster with Limbitrol. No differences were noted between groups in the degree or rate of improvement of the sleep laboratory parameters nor in sleep Stages 1 to 4. Percentages of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM latency were similarly affected by the drugs, but REM density showed a significantly greater decrease with Limbitrol. Phasic REM factors may be crucial in the role of REM sleep and depression.", 
    "22": "Data from 74 patients with panic disorder were evaluated to determine the comparative efficacy of imipramine, alprazolam, and trazodone. All patients were treated with placebo for 3 weeks and were then blindly switched to active treatment for 8 weeks. Both imipramine and alprazolam were highly effective in reducing the symptoms of generalized anxiety, the frequency of panic attacks, and phobic avoidance. However, the time course of these effects differed; alprazolam demonstrated therapeutic properties during the first week, whereas the therapeutic efficacy of imipramine was not clearly apparent until the fourth week of treatment. Relative to imipramine and alprazolam, trazodone was not an effective treatment for panic disorder and was poorly tolerated; only 17 trazodone-treated patients completed at least 4 weeks of treatment, and only 2 patients were considered good or complete responders. These findings support the hypotheses that drugs that are efficacious in the treatment of panic disorders act by altering noradrenergic function and that drugs with primary actions on serotonin function are likely to be less effective treatments. The different time courses of therapeutic action of imipramine and alprazolam indicate that these drugs ameliorate panic anxiety via different mechanisms. The possible therapeutic applications of this observation are discussed.", 
    "23": "A review of case notes of patients attending a general hospital psychiatric outpatient clinic revealed that 75% of patients with depressive disorders and 38% of patients with neurotic disorders were prescribed antidepressants. Antidepressants were often prescribed for long periods in low doses and in combination with benzodiazepines. There was less polypharmacy, however, with more sedating antidepressants. The results indicate that clinical prescription habits for antidepressants may still be at some variance with recommendations from the literature.", 
    "24": "Midazolam is a new, water-soluble benzodiazepine that has been reported to produce a greater degree of amnesia than does diazepam. This study compares the amnesia produced in patients sedated with midazolam or diazepam or in combination with fentanyl during oral surgery. Twenty-four hours after surgery, each patient answered a questionnaire designed to assess his or her recall of events during and after surgery. Patients who received midazolam alone recalled significantly less than did patients in either diazepam group. The addition of fentanyl to midazolam did not produce any significant difference in recall.", 
    "25": "The authors describe the case of a 12 years old boy suffering from an epilepsy with complex partial seizures evolving to a syndrome of epilepsy with continuous spikes-waves during sleep. A dramatic improvement follows clobazam introduction in the treatment. The originality of this case report and the possible mechanism of action of clobazam are discussed.", 
    "26": "Among 100 infants with infantile spasms studied before treatment, 14 had idiopathic spasms with a favourable outcome. They had a normal development, including reaching for objects before the age of 5 months and moderate regression without loss of eye following. Although it was hysarhythmic, the EEG tracing showed identifiable basic activity and sleep spindles; there was no slow waves focus even after diazepam administration and the spasms were \"independent\" even during a cluster. This type of infantile spasms seems to be a particular type of non-lesional epilepsy. It contrasts with idiopathic spasms of unfavourable outcome that apparently result from a preexisting and overlooked focal lesion responsible of later cognitive troubles.", 
    "27": "In a double-blind, randomised trial the efficacy and safety of Ro 15-1788, a new benzodiazepine antagonist, was assessed in forty adults undergoing gastroscopy under diazepam sedation. Criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation and anterograde amnesia. There was a significantly faster recovery of the patients after the injection of 0.6-1.0 mg of Ro 15-1788 than after placebo. Patients were awake shortly after Ro 15-1788, but remained drowsy or asleep after placebo administration. There were no side effects of note.", 
    "28": "The competitive benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 proved efficacious after general anaesthesia induced by flunitrazepam. It showed a quick onset of action within 1-2 min. After antagonisation, the heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate remained stable. No increased demand for analgesics could be demonstrated postoperatively. A transient anxiety that could be observed in 7 of 38 patients after doses between 0.5 and 2.0 mg seemed of minor clinical importance but may indicate that Ro 15-1788 acted not only as a pure antagonist but as a partially inverse agonist as well. Recurrence of sedation could be observed in 6 out of 38 patients after 2 h of Ro 15-1788 dosage. Careful observation of the patients for at least 2 h is therefore recommended even if antagonisation seemed successful. It was possible to reverse the benzodiazepine action successfully with doses between 0.3 and 0.8 mg. After these doses the patients will awake gently and gradually and unwanted side effects will be avoided. In our experience, Ro 15-1788 is a useful improvement in benzodiazepine application after surgical anaesthesia.", 
    "29": "A single intoxicating dose of chlordiazepoxide HCl (p.o.) in the rat can induce quantifiable manifestations of physical dependence. Dependence was revealed by antagonist precipitation (Ro 15-1788, CGS-8216) as well as spontaneous emergence of neurobehavioral signs of withdrawal observed by multiple raters blind to treatments. Ro 15-1788 was 45% more effective than CGS-8216 in both reversing chlordiazepoxide intoxication and expressing withdrawal signs. The severity of Ro 15-1788-precipitated withdrawal varied with chlordiazepoxide dose, Ro 15-1788 dose and the agonist-antagonist dose interval. Maximal precipitated dependence was evoked 3 days after chlordiazepoxide HCl (450 mg/kg) by Ro 15-1788 (25 mg/kg i.p.). The precipitated syndrome consisted of tail erection, reduced motor activity, high step, curled claw, arched back, muscle hypertonus and piloerection. Ro 15-1788-precipitated dependence emerged between 28 and 52 hr, peaked at 76 hr and disappeared by 124 hr. Spontaneous withdrawal had emerged from 100 to 124 hr and then faded gradually. The neurobehavioral expression of central nervous system depression and its reversal were necessary but not sufficient conditions for the induction and expression of acute chlordiazepoxide dependence. These results suggest caution in reviving acute benzodiazepine-overdosed patients to avoid iatrogenic withdrawal analogous to naloxone for opiates.", 
    "30": "Inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated synaptic currents were studied in dissociated primary cultures of neonatal rat cortex with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Immunocytochemical staining of the cultures showed the presence of a large number of glutamic acid decarboxylase-containing neurons, and electrical stimulation of randomly selected neurons produced in many cases chloride-mediated and bicuculline-sensitive inhibitory synaptic currents in postsynaptic cells. The amplitude and decay time of the inhibitory synaptic currents were increased by flunitrazepam and decreased by the beta-carboline derivative methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, two high-affinity ligands for the allosteric regulatory sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. The imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-1788, another high-affinity ligand of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor regulatory sites that has negligible intrinsic activity, blocked the action of flunitrazepam and beta-carboline. However, Ro 15-1788 also increased the decay rate of the inhibitory synaptic currents. This might suggest that an endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine-beta-carboline binding site is operative in gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated synaptic transmission.", 
    "31": "Some 1-aryl-3-methylpyrazolo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-ones, were prepared and tested for their ability to displace specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding from bovine brain membranes. The 1-meta-aryl derivatives were the compounds that bound with the highest affinity within this class. Our 13C NMR study suggested a correlation between the binding affinity and the chemical shift value of a carbon atom of the tricyclic system.", 
    "32": "The effect of crude rat hypothalamic extracts on the lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was investigated. It was found that hypothalamic extracts (HE) significantly inhibited the 3H-thymidine incorporation by the mouse spleen lymphocytes cultured in vitro. The factor (or factors) responsible for the antimitogenic effect is thermostabile and partially destroyable by trypsin digestion. The latter observation suggests that it is probably a peptide. Diazepam had been found to exert a similar antimitogenic effect on mouse spleen lymphocytes as HE. The putative endogenous benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor ligand is also assumed to be a peptide. The working hypothesis that the antimitogenic effect of HE depends on endogenous substance acting via BZD receptor was proposed. To test such a possibility, the interaction of HE and specific BZD receptor ligands Ro-15-1788 and Ro-5-4864 was investigated. It was found that Ro-5-4864 alone suppressed the lymphocyte proliferation, and the joint antiproliferative effect of HE and Ro-5-4864 was not additive. Ro-15-1788 alone did not influence the lymphocyte proliferation but abolished the antiproliferative effect of HE. These data suggest that antimitogenic factor present in HE acts via BZD receptors.", 
    "33": "A quantitative relationship between the efficacy (i.e. maximum enhancement) of Cl- to increase [3H]flunitrazepam binding and the density of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding sites was observed in well-washed membrane fragments of rat cerebral cortex previously exposed to phospholipase A2. This relationship (described by the equation y = ABx) was maintained when [3H]flunitrazepam was assayed at Cl- concentrations between 100 and 600 mM, and was not qualitatively altered by the presence of 100 microM pentobarbital. However, under experimental conditions that reduced the ratio of [35S]TBPS binding sites/benzodiazepine receptors, the effects of pentobarbital suggest that the conductance state of benzodiazepine receptor-coupled chloride channels may be the primary determinant of Cl- enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding.", 
    "34": "In day 4 female rats lorazepam, diazepam and clonazepam produced dose-related increases in forward walking and loss of righting and diazepam produced a dose-related increase in paddling. Lorazepam and diazepam increased jerks of the fore- and hind-limbs and the whole body, and clonazepam increased the latter two; these increases were not dose-related. Some doses of lorazepam and the lowest dose of diazepam increased tonic-clonic movements. Thus the benzodiazepines were observed to have two kinds of stimulant effect in day 4 rats. One is to cause hyperactivity and this effect is dose-related. The other is to cause a type of seizure-like behavior, although this action is not dose-related and the responses can be distinguished from those caused by convulsant compounds. The effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 resembled those of the benzodiazepines. It increased hind-limb and whole body jerks, forward walking, paddling, loss of righting and tonic-clonic movements. CL 218,872, which is selective for type 1 benzodiazepine receptors, was devoid of significant effects. This suggests that the behavioral changes observed with the other compounds were mediated by the type 2 receptors.", 
    "35": "The influence of phenazepam on plasma ACTH level before and after exposure to stress in the \"open field\" test was investigated in C57BL/6, BALB/c and F1(C57BL/6 X BALB/c) mice. The differences in the dose-dependent drug effect on the hormone level between strains were studied. A correlation between ACTH level and a characteristic animal behaviour has been established for different strains.", 
    "36": "An endogenous brain substance that binds to the central-type benzodiazepine receptors with agonist properties is present in both rat and bovine brains. This substance has been purified to homogeneity from bovine brain by immunoaffinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal anti-benzodiazepine antibody followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and two reversed-phase HPLC steps. The purified substance was characterized as the benzodiazepine N-desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam). The techniques used for the identification were mass spectrometry, HPLC, spectrophotometry, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and immunological techniques. Benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity was also found in all the human brains tested, including six brains that had been stored in paraffin since 1940, fifteen years before the first synthesis of benzodiazepines. These results show that benzodiazepine-like molecules of natural origin--and possibly benzodiazepines themselves--are present in human and other mammalian brains.", 
    "37": "A number of vitamin D3 metabolites inhibit benzodiazepine- and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells. The inhibition is dose dependent and occurs at nM concentrations. The order of potency of these compounds is 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol greater than 1,25,26-trihydroxycholecalciferol greater than 1,24R,25-trihydroxycholecalciferol greater than 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol greater than 24R,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol greater than 25S,26-dihydroxycholecalciferol. The inhibition is maximal when the vitamin D3 analogs are added together with the inducer, and becomes progressively decreased with delayed addition. These results suggest that the vitamin D3 metabolites may play a regulatory role in erythropoiesis.", 
    "38": "The use of tissue homogenates in receptor binding assays raises serious questions as to the physiological value of a preparation which examines receptors (binding sites) in disrupted tissue. In order to usefully study the regulatory properties of neurotransmitter receptors under physiological conditions, the necessity for tissue preparations which retain some degree of cellular integrity is clear. We review here the experiments which have utilized intact tissue - largely in the form of thick slices - to perform radioligand binding assays. There are many reports which note marked differences between studies in intact versus broken cell preparations. For example, significant discrepancies in KD and Bmax values are apparent for [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate (muscarinic) and [3H] ouabain (Na+/K+-ATP ase, sodium pump) sites in brain and muscle respectively. A further example is the well-described stimulatory effect of GABA on benzodiazepine binding sites which is not seen in tissue slices. Other examples are highlighted. For all ligands so far examined, binding to slices is reversible, stereospecific, saturable, displaceable by appropriate drugs and of high affinity (nM). The method developed in our own laboratory is inexpensive, rapid and involves a minimum of tissue preparation. The technique is so simple as to allow many workers to enter this field who would not otherwise have done so. We suggest that metabolically active tissue slices offer the simplest approach to the study of cell-surface receptor regulation in living tissue.", 
    "39": "Benzodiazepine receptors of rat cerebellum were assayed with [3H]-labeled flunitrazepam at 37 degrees C, and assays were terminated by filtration in a cold room according to one of three protocols: keeping each sample at 37 degrees C until ready for filtration, taking the batch of samples (30) into the cold room and filtering sequentially in the order 1-30, and taking the batch of 30 samples into the cold room and filtering sequentially in the order 30-1. the results for each protocol were substantially different from each other, indicating that rapid disruption of equilibrium occurred as the samples cooled in the cold room while waiting to be filtered. Positive or negative cooperativity of binding was apparent, and misleading effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid on the affinity of diazepam were observed, unless each sample was kept at 37 degrees C until just prior to filtration.", 
    "40": "The perifusion technique was used to investigate the action of diazepam (DZ), a benzodiazepine molecule known to compete for TRH receptor binding in rat pituitary, on TRH-induced TSH and GH release. The release kinetics for the two hormones from quartered pituitaries were measured in response to a 6-min pulse of TRH (10 nM), without or with DZ addition for a period of 30 min before and during the TRH pulse, plus an additional 15-min period. The dynamic patterns of TSH and GH release in response to TRH were characterized by a rapid increase in hormone release, declining slowly over the next 20 min. The rate of release represented 2.98 +/- 0.02 (+/- SE) and 1.75 +/- 0.06 times the corresponding basal level for TSH and GH, respectively, when evaluated over the first 15 min of the response to TRH. Addition of increasing doses of DZ suppressed the stimulatory effect of TRH in a dose-related manner, with an ID50 of 3 nM for both TSH and GH. The maximal effect of DZ was obtained with a concentration of 10 nM for both hormones. Ro 15-1788 (100 nM), a selective antagonist of the central type of benzodiazepine-binding sites (added to the perifusion system 30 min before DZ and then during the whole period of DZ perifusion), completely abolished (P less than 0.01) the inhibitory effect of DZ (10 nM) on the TRH-induced TSH and GH responses. When added alone before the TRH pulse, Ro 15-1788 had no effect on the TSH response to TRH. In contrast, PK 11,195 (100 nM), a selective antagonist of the nonneuronal benzodiazepine-binding sites, was unable to abolish the inhibitory action of DZ on TRH-stimulated TSH release. In addition, the effects of four other types of benzodiazepine (flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide, midazolam, and medazepam), all tested at a 10-nM concentration, corroborated these findings. Furthermore, DZ inhibition of the TSH response was nullified by picrotoxin (1 microM), but not by bicuculline (1 microM), two gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonists that had no effect, by themselves, on this response. For comparison, the effect of DZ (10 nM) was also tested on the release of GH in response to human GH-releasing factor-(1-44)-NH2 (10 nM) and was found to be ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Diazepam-binding inhibitor is a novel peptide purified to homogeneity from rat and human brain. Diazepam-binding inhibitor is present, though not exclusively, in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons where it is believed to inhibit GABAergic neurotransmission mediated by GABA by binding to the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex. Since an impairment of central GABAergic tone has been postulated to be associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, we measured human diazepam-binding inhibitor immunoreactivity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from endogenous depression, schizophrenia, and dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Patients with major depression had significantly higher concentrations of human diazepam-binding inhibitor immunoreactivity in CSF when compared with age- and sex-matched normal volunteers, while no difference in CSF diazepam-binding inhibitor immunoreactivity was found in schizophrenics or patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type when compared with controls. The possibility is discussed that the increased CSF human diazepam-binding inhibitor immunoreactivity observed in depressed patients may represent a functional disinhibition of GABAergic neurotransmission associated with depression.", 
    "42": "The specific binding of [N-methyl-3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZP) to a membrane fraction from the supraoesophageal ganglion of the locust (Schistocerca gregaria) has been measured. The ligand binds reversibly with a KD of 47 nM. The binding is Ca2+-dependent, a property not found for the equivalent binding site in vertebrate brain. The pharmacological characteristics of the locust binding site show similarities to both central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in mammals. Thus binding is enhanced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a feature of mammalian central receptors, whereas the ligand Ro 5-4864 was more effective in displacing [3H]FNZP than was clonazepam, which is the pattern seen in mammalian peripheral receptors. The locust benzodiazepine binding site was photoaffinity-labelled by [3H]FNZP, and two major proteins of Mr 45K and 59K were specifically labelled. In parallel experiments with rat brain membranes a single major protein of Mr 49K was labelled, a finding in keeping with many reports in the literature. We suggest that the FNZP binding site described here is part of the GABA receptor complex of locust ganglia. The insect receptor appears to have the same general organization as its mammalian counterpart but differs significantly in its detailed properties.", 
    "43": "The technological processing of the benzodiazepine derivatives chlordiazepoxide, medazepam, diazepam, nitrazepam and clonazepam with methyl cellulose (mc) and hydroxyethylcellulose--especially physical mixtures and evaporates--led to an improved dissolution of the problem drugs. The effect of the adjuvants is remarkable in the initial phase of the dissolution and very distinctive at the end of the experiment. Obviously there is no relation between saturation solubility and dissolution. Only with nitrazepam and clonazepam, but less clearly with medazepam, an increase of solubility by the mc-trituration was observed. Studies of the binding showed a concentration and temperature dependent interaction of the benzodiazepines diazepam, clonazepam, medazepam and nitrazepam, to mc. As X-ray diffraction and differential thermoanalysis gave no interpretation for the improved dissolution behaviour of drug/adjuvant preparations, it is assumed that a high distribution of the drug particles in the dissolution medium by the preceding treatment with cellulose ether is the main reason for the increase of the dissolution rate.", 
    "44": "Head-twitching in rats induced by quipazine was reduced by bilateral lesions of the locus coeruleus (LC) produced by 6-hydroxydopamine. Both beta 1-and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists potentiated the head-twitch induced by quipazine in sham-operated controls. Lesions of the locus coeruleus increased the responses to the beta 1-adrenoceptor agonists, prenalterol and dobutamine, but reduced the response to the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol and procaterol. Diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) also potentiated the response to quipazine and this was reversed to inhibition by lesions of the locus coeruleus. These results suggest that the beta 1-adrenoceptors involved are postsynaptic and the beta 2-adrenoceptors are presynaptic to neurones of the locus coeruleus and indicate a dual action of diazepam on the head-twitch induced by quipazine. Possible mechanisms for these effects are discussed.", 
    "45": "After 70 treatments with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), using a combination of dipotassiumclorazepate p.o. 12 h before treatment and tilidin-naloxon 45 min before ESWL, 56 patients reported to be painfree or only minor, well-tolerable pain. Informed consent was obtained in all patients for this pilot study, leaving the possibility of further pain medication. 7 patients asked for an additional analgesic (fentanyl) and another 7 patients required a sedative (midazolam). No further anesthesiologic procedures were necessary. Nausea was observed in one patient as a possible side-effect of tilidin. To confirm these preliminary results, a prospective randomized study is currently conducted.", 
    "46": "Eighty out-patients with neurotic disorders were studied in an integrated treatment model combining psychotherapy and psychotropics in a \"conjoint marital therapy\" setting. The spouses, who seemed a healthy group, were used as reporters, as controls and as participants in the psychotherapy. The pharmacological trial was a double-blind, cross-over study, comparing bromazepam and thioridazine after a placebo period. Bromazepam was more effective in controlling different anxiety symptoms and demonstrated more potent activating properties than thioridazine. Hostility symptoms, however, responded better to thioridazine. These findings were confirmed by ratings performed by patients, spouses and the investigator. Differences in drug preference and drop-out rate showed the same tendency. Nine weeks' continuous treatment did not change the differences found in the cross-over study. No pharmacological rebound symptoms were observed after drug withdrawal. The personality of the spouses was related to the outcome in the patients. Moreover, there was an obvious positive interaction between the psychotherapy given and the drug treatment.", 
    "47": "Clonazepam was administered for 10 or more days on three different dose regimens (0.5, 0.25 and 0.08 mg kg-1 twice daily) to mice given pentetrazol by slow intravenous infusion. Plasma concentrations of clonazepam were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant effect of clonazepam at all doses but was incomplete and could be overcome by increasing the dose. With the 0.5 and 0.25 mg kg-1 regimens there was no significant change in the drug plasma concentrations during development of tolerance; on the lowest dose, levels were below the limits of accurate detection. Anticonvulsant tolerance does not seem to be the result of a disturbance in clonazepam metabolism.", 
    "48": "The ancient Chinese remedy Suanzaorentang was originally described in Kin-Kue-Yao-Lueh for patients with weakness, irritability and insomnia. In our preliminary observations on suanzaorentang, it seemed to be a promising anxiolytic remedy. A controlled comparative double-blind clinical trial was set up to assess the anxiolytic effect of suanzaorentang. Suanzaorentang (250 mg t.i.d.) and diazepam (2 mg t.i.d.) had almost the same anxiolytic effect. However, suanzaorentang, but not diazepam, improved the psychomotor performance during the daytime. No significant subjective side effects were observed during treatment with suanzaorentang. All laboratory tests, including liver function tests (serum SGOT, SGPT, albumin, globulin, bilirubin), renal function tests (BUN, serum creatinine), electrolyte balances (serum K+, Na+, Cl-, Ca++), serum cholesterol-triglyceride-HDL-c, thyroid function test (serum T4), chest P-A X-ray film, blood-urine-stool routine examinations (BUS routines), were unaltered after one week's administration of the compound.", 
    "49": "The effect of medazepam in a model of isolation aggression in mice was studied according to Yen et al. It was established that the mean effective dose of medazepam was 250 micrograms/kg and the therapeutic index (LD50:ED50) 6200. The simultaneous biochemical investigations showed a reduction of the affinity and number of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of aggressive animals. Medazepam 10 mg/kg p.o. led to the restoration of the number of benzodiazepine receptors at a single and 10-day treatment.", 
    "50": "The influence of propranolol coadministration or of cigarette smoking on the kinetics of desmethyldiazepam following a single 20-mg intravenous dose of clorazepate dipotassium was evaluated in healthy volunteers. In Study One, intravenous clorazepate was given once in the control condition, and again during coadministration of propranolol, 80 mg twice daily. Compliance with the prescribed propranolol regimen was verified by measurement of serum propranolol concentrations (mean, 37 ng/ml). In control vs propranolol treatment conditions, there was no significant difference in desmethyldiazepam volume of distribution (1.27 vs 1.23 liters/kg) or in free fraction in serum (1.83 vs 1.80% unbound). There was a small although statistically significant prolongation of desmethyldiazepam half-life (55 vs 61 h, P less than 0.05) and reduction in clearance (0.281 vs 0.247 ml/min/kg, P less than 0.02) attributable to propranolol. In Study Two, desmethyldiazepam kinetics were compared in eight cigarette smokers (mean, 19 cigarettes/day) and in 11 nonsmoking controls matched for age, sex, and body weight. There was no significant difference between controls and cigarette smokers in desmethyldiazepam volume of distribution (1.29 vs 1.34 liters/kg), elimination half-life (55 vs 59 h), clearance (0.284 vs 0.276 ml/min/kg), or free fraction in serum (1.96 vs 1.92% unbound). Thus, propranolol slightly although significantly impairs the clearance of desmethyldiazepam and prolongs its half-life. Cigarette smoking has no apparent influence on desmethyldiazepam kinetics.", 
    "51": "It has been hypothesized that the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are related to structural brain abnormalities and respond poorly to treatment with neuroleptics and other drugs since they are persistent, if not irreversible. Because this issue has important clinical and theoretical implications, the authors reviewed the relevant literature on the effect of neuroleptics, L-dopa, and other psychotropic agents on these symptoms. Contrary to the above conclusions, several large scale, controlled studies of the therapeutic effects of conventional neuroleptics have reported clinically relevant improvement in negative symptoms in a significant proportion of schizophrenics. The improvement tended to occur early in the course of treatment and was most notable in those patients with relatively shorter durations of illness. A specific class of neuroleptic drugs not studied in these earlier large scale trials, the diphenylbutylpiperidines, has been suggested to be particularly likely to ameliorate negative symptoms, possibly because of their significant calcium channel blocking action. A review of the clinical studies comparing this group of neuroleptics with those from different classes supports the suggestion that they can produce greater improvement in anergia and emotional withdrawal. Six open and four controlled trials of L-dopa treatment of negative symptoms with L-dopa alone or in combination with neuroleptics. As with neuroleptics alone, improvement tended to be greater in those with a shorter duration of illness. The available evidence suggests that negative symptoms, at least in less chronic schizophrenic patients, may be partially responsive to currently available pharmacological intervention in a significant proportion of schizophrenics.", 
    "52": "The influence of two anxiolytics--diazepam and buspirone--on prolactin, thyrotrophin and cortisol levels in green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) plasma was studied 30 min following i/m injection. Diazepam at 1 mg/kg decreased prolactin and cortisol levels by 30-50% compared to the control animals. Buspirone at 2.5-10 mg/kg induced a 7-10-fold increase in prolactin level but did not change cortisol and thyrotrophin concentration. Buspirone analog--Mj 138-05 at 10 mg/kg produced a 2-3-fold increase in plasma prolactin content in some animals, while at a dose of 5 mg/kg it exerted no detectable effect. Possible neurochemical mechanisms of the effects observed are discussed.", 
    "53": "The metabolites of camazepam in rat plasma were characterized by t.l.c., mass spectroscopy and n.m.r. spectroscopy as the mono- or di-desmethylated metabolites and the mono- or di-hydroxymethylated metabolites. The postulated metabolic pathways of camazepam involved stepwise series of desmethylations. The mono- and di-hydroxymethylated metabolites were found to be intermediates in desmethylation. Temazepam and oxazepam, metabolites of camazepam, were formed from the mono- or di-hydroxymethylated metabolites.", 
    "54": "Seventy-one patients with major depression or an anxiety disorder were treated with benzodiazepines. They were followed prospectively for evidence of misuse or abuse. There was no evidence of benzodiazepine abuse. Five patients (all with major depression) misused their benzodiazepines.", 
    "55": "Fifteen patients with 146 cumulative years of tranquilizer use were withdrawn from their benzodiazepine (nine gradually and six abruptly), and buspirone, a new nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic, was substituted. The addition of buspirone did not appear to lessen the intensity of the withdrawal state. This finding supports preclinical studies indicating that buspirone has no clinically significant benzodiazepine receptor activity.", 
    "56": "The stimulus properties of caffeine were studied in separate groups of rats trained to discriminate between i.p. injections of saline and either 10 or 30 mg/kg of caffeine in a discrete-trial avoidance paradigm. Stimulus control of behavior (i.e., reliable completion of at least 18 of 20 trials on the appropriate choice lever after injection of saline or caffeine) was established in an average of 50 to 52 sessions. Novel drugs were tested over a range of doses for generalization to one (10 mg/kg) or both doses of caffeine. The methylxanthine derivatives, theophylline, theobromine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine, 8-phenyltheophylline and 8-chlorotheophylline, were generalized to caffeine partially or not at all. Of the nonxanthine drugs, apomorphine, clonidine and picrotoxin occasioned responding only on the saline-appropriate choice lever, d-amphetamine and ephedrine generalized partially, and cocaine and methylphenidate generalized with caffeine completely, as did 2-(2-chloro-5-trifluoromethylphenylimino)imidazolidine an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist. The discriminative effects of 10 mg/kg of caffeine were blocked dose-dependently and completely by alpha adrenergic receptor blocking drugs (phentolamine, prazosin and yohimbine) and were blocked partially by propranolol and by drugs having behavioral depressant properties (diazepam, pentobarbital and the adenosine analogs, R-(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, cyclohexyladenosine, 2-chloroadenosine). The blockade by phentolamine could be surmounted by increasing the dose of caffeine, the partial blockade by diazepam and 2-chloroadenosine could not. Alpha adrenergic receptor blocking drugs also antagonized the caffeine-like discriminative effects of methylphenidate and 2-(2-chloro-5-trifluoromethylphenylimino)imidazolidine. The discriminative stimulus effects of caffeine in the rat appear to be mediated in part by alpha adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "57": "Pirenzepine, McN-A-343 and oxotremorine were used to determine the subtypes of muscarinic receptors involved in the secretion of catecholamines from the isolated perfused adrenal gland of the rat. In the presence of 0.1 microM pirenzepine, the concentration-secretion curve for muscarine was shifted in parallel to the right by almost one log unit. With 0.5 microM the shift was over two log units. The apparent dissociation constant for pirenzepine was about 1.12 X 10(-8) M. Perfusion with McN-A-343 (1-30 microM) did not evoke the secretion of catecholamines. A further increase to very high concentrations (100-1000 microM) caused only a modest secretion (about 50 ng/5 min with 300 microM as compared to the same amount of secretion obtained with 1 microM muscarine). Secretion evoked by nicotine was significantly reduced (30%) by 3 microM McN-A-343, and the inhibition increased (90%) with higher concentrations (100 microM). McN-A-343 also produced concentration-dependent inhibition of catecholamine secretion evoked by muscarine. A significant effect was observed at 30 microM and reached a maximum level at 300 microM. Oxotremorine, like McN-A-343 was a partial agonist on the muscarinic receptors; but unlike McN-A-343, did not block the stimulatory effects of nicotine. Although the pirenzepine data suggest that M1 receptors are responsible for the secretion of catecholamines in the rat adrenal medulla, this conclusion is not supported by the results obtained with the M1-receptor agonist, McN-A-343, which proved to be an effective blocker of muscarinic as well as nicotinic receptors.", 
    "58": "The influence exerted by chlordiazepoxide or midazolam upon auditory nerve compound action potential (cAP) and cochlear microphonic (CM) has been analyzed in chronic as well as in acutely prepared guinea pigs. Pre-receptorial variables were carefully controlled. The benzodiazepines dissociated the cochlear recorded potentials, increasing the cAP amplitude, in response to clicks, and decreasing the CM area, produced by a coherent pure tone pip. Both responses were dose related. A direct effect upon the cochlea was eliminated by local infusion of the drugs. It was also demonstrated to be a specific benzodiazepinic action because the use of an antagonist, Ro 15-1788, abolished the effect. Benzodiazepines could have increased the GABAergic activity at the pontine origins of the olivo-cochlear bundle or in the reticulo-cochlear fibers. These are the only central pathways that could be responsible for the effects obtained at the cochlea or auditory nerve levels. We suggest that this is the cause of the withdrawal of inhibitory tonus from the primary afferent fibers mediated by the efferent system (lateral superior olive), as may occur during dishabituation. It may also be the cause of the CM decrement, but the effect in this case would be exerted mainly through another set of efferent fibers (trapezoid body nucleus).", 
    "59": "Critically ill patients are prone to stress-induced ulcerations in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which might lead to life-threatening bleeding. Therefore, an effective stress ulcer prophylaxis is absolutely indicated and H2-blocking agents, anticholinergics, antacids, sucralfate, enteral nutrition and prostaglandin E analoges are recommended. H2-blocking agents seem to provide effective prophylaxis, but severe side effects seem to limit their application. Most of all, as they are less effective as antacids and as they cause considerable costs. Additionally H2-blocking agents elevate gastric pH, thereby favouring microbic colonisation of gastric juice. Microorganism from gastric juice may reach the tracheobronchial system and lead to nosocomial pneumonias. The contaminated gastric juice may also be considered as endogenous source for sepsis and entero-colitis. The anticholinergic agent pirenzepine does not increase gastric pH and seems to be effective in neurological and neurosurgical intensive care patients. Antacids are effective in stress ulcer bleeding prophylaxis, but favour bacterial overgrowth, are badly tolerated by patients and cause a high amount of nursing time. Sucralfate seems to be as effective as antacids, is better tolerated and does not elevate gastric pH. The remaining acidity of gastric juice blocks bacterial contamination. After all, the smallest costs of effective stress ulcer prophylaxis, makes sucralfate to the medicament of first choice. However, in severely ill patients, a combined stress ulcer prophylaxis with two or more agents seems to be necessary.", 
    "60": "This study investigated the spatial distribution and cellular-synaptic generation of hippocampal sharp waves (SPW) in the dorsal hippocampus of the awake rat. Depth analyses of SPWs were performed by stepping the recording electrode in 82.5 microns increments. SPWs were present during slow wave sleep, awake immobility, drinking, grooming and eating (0.01-2/s). The largest negative SPWs were recorded from the middle part of the stratum radiatum of CA1, the stratum lucidum of CA3, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and from layer I of the subiculum, in that order. The polarity of the SPWs was positive in layers II-IV of the subiculum, in stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA3, and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The electrical gradients across the null zones of the field SPWs were as large as 8-14 mV/mm. SPWs were associated with population bursts of pyramidal cells and increased discharges of interneurons and granule cells. During the SPW the excitability of granule cells and pyramidal cells to afferent volleys increased considerably. Picrotoxin and atropine and aspiration lesion of the fimbria-fornix increased either the amplitude or the frequency of SPWs. Diazepam and Nembutal could completely abolish SPWs. It is suggested that: hippocampal SPWs are triggered by a population burst of CA3 pyramidal cells as a result of temporary disinhibition from afferent control; and field SPWs represent summed extracellular PSPs of CA1 and subicular pyramidal cells, and dentate granular cells induced by the Schaffer collaterals and the associational fibers of hilar cells, respectively. The relevance of the physiological SPWs to epileptic interictal spikes and long-term potentiation is discussed.", 
    "61": "Activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors was studied by measuring agonist-stimulated inositol lipid turnover and changes in [Ca2+]i in dissociated salt gland secretory cells. Carbachol stimulation of quin2-loaded cells results in a sustained 4-fold increase in [Ca2+]i, while incorporation of [32P]Pi into phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidate are similarly increased. [3H]Inositol phosphates, measured in the presence of Li+, increased 13-fold. The stimulated increment in [Ca2+]i required extracellular Ca2+, whereas [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was independent of external Ca2+. Dose-response curves for carbachol-induced increments in [Ca2+]i, PI labeling, and labeled inositol phosphate release are similar, with EC50 values of 6, 4.5 and 8 microM, respectively. Dissociation constants for atropine vs. the quin2 and phospholipid responses are 0.59 +/- 0.3 nM and 0.48 +/- 0.28 nM, respectively. These cells thus provide a model system for the study of non-exocytotic secretion as a consequence of stimulated inositol lipid turnover.", 
    "62": "Benzodiazepine agonists such as diazepam, flunitrazepam and clonazepam enhanced GABA (30 microM)-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in membrane vesicles from the rat cerebral cortex. The rank order of potencies was flunitrazepam greater than diazepam = clonazepam. beta-Carboline-3-carboxylate esters beta-CCM, beta-CCE and DMCM inhibited GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. The rank order of inhibitory potencies was DMCM greater than beta-CCM greater than beta-CCE. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 antagonized the enhancement of flunitrazepam and the inhibition of DMCM on GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in a competitive inhibitory manner. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors regulate GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and there is a functional coupling between the GABA and benzodiazepine receptors, and chloride channels in membrane vesicles from the rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "63": "The autoradiographic localization of subcomponents of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-chloride ionophore complex has provided insight into the distribution of this macromolecular system. GABA inhibits neurons by preferentially increasing the permeability of the affected membrane to chloride ions. This inhibition can be modified by the presence of other substances which bind to the GABA receptor complex. Autoradiographic localization of specific receptor subtypes associated with this complex has been accomplished in the central nervous system. This type of analysis has been performed on high and low affinity GABAA, benzodiazepine (BZ; both BZ1 and BZ2) and convulsant sites. These receptor sites are situated in distinct brain regions and co-exist in several areas. Other receptor subtypes, which may be influenced by the presence of GABA, can be analyzed for comparison in order to define regions of the brain where GABA may be exerting independent effects (i.e., those not associated with chloride channels). Microscopic localization of receptor sites indicates specific areas to investigate in further studies concerning the characterization of subcomponents of the macromolecular GABA complex associated with chloride ion channels.", 
    "64": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acts primarily on receptors that increase chloride permeability in postsynaptic neurons. These receptors are defined by sensitivity to the agonist muscimol and the antagonist bicuculline, and are also subject to indirect allosteric inhibition by picrotoxin-like convulsants and enhancement by the clinically important drugs, the benzodiazepines and the barbiturates. All of these drugs modulate GABA-receptor regulated chloride channels at the cellular level assayed by electrophysiological or radioactive ion tracer techniques. Specific receptor sites for GABA, benzodiazepines, picrotoxin/convulsants, and barbiturates can be assayed in vitro by radioactive ligand binding. Mutual chloride-dependent allosteric interactions between the four receptor sites indicate that they are all coupled in the same membrane macromolecular complex. Indirect effects of barbiturates on the other three binding sites define a pharmacologically specific, stereospecific receptor. All of the activities can be solubilized in the mild detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]propane sulfonate (CHAPS) and co-purify as a single protein complex.", 
    "65": "Many neurons cultured from the embryonic mammalian central nervous system (CNS) express benzodiazepine receptors while some neurons differentiate specific transmitter phenotypes like glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the synthetic enzyme for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The benzodiazepine receptors in these cultured neurons are often, if not always coupled to a practically ubiquitous GABA-mediated function, activation of Cl- ion conductance. The transmitter signal serves to inhibit neuronal excitability and is facilitated by clinically important benzodiazepines. Here we review some details regarding the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines on membrane excitability.", 
    "66": "Four hybridoma lines secreting monoclonal antibodies to benzodiazepines were produced after BALB/c mice were immunized with a benzodiazepine-bovine serum albumin conjugate. The monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascites fluids, and their binding affinities for benzodiazepines and other benzodiazepine receptor ligands were determined. These antibodies have very high binding affinities for diazepam, flunitrazepam, Ro5-4864, Ro5-3453, Ro11-6896, and Ro5-3438 (the Kd values are in the 10(-9) M range). However, these antibodies have very low affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists (beta-carbolines) and antagonists (Ro15-1788 and CGS-8216). One of the monoclonal antibodies (21-7F9) has been used to demonstrate the existence of benzodiazepine-like molecules in the brain and for the purification of these molecules. Immunocytochemical experiments show that these molecules are neuronal and not glial and that they are ubiquitously distributed throughout the brain. Immunoblots indicate the presence of benzodiazepine-like epitopes in several brain peptides. An endogenous substance that binds to the central-type benzodiazepine receptor with agonist properties has been purified to homogeneity from the bovine brain. The purification consisted on immunoaffinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal anti-benzodiazepine antibody followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and two reverse phase HPLCs. The purified substance has a small molecular weight and its activity is protease resistant. The endogenous substance blocks the binding of agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists to the central-type benzodiazepine receptor but it does not inhibit the binding of Ro5-4864 to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid increases the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for the purified substance. Preliminary evidence indicates that the purified substance is a benzodiazepine with a molecular structure that is identical or very close to N-desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "67": "To investigate the efficacy of midazolam (Dormicum; Roche) as a paediatric premedication, 150 children, aged 6 months-5 years, were divided into three groups. All three groups spent time with the anaesthetist to allow rapport to be established. Group A received midazolam premedication, group B received oral trimeprazine, droperidol and methadone (TDM) and group C received no sedative medication. Midazolam gave the best behaviour patterns in the holding room. Behaviour at induction was the same in all three groups. The recovery times were similar in the midazolam and unsedated groups, but in the TDM group recovery was significantly delayed. Temperatures remained stable in the unsedated and midazolam groups, but decreased in the TDM group. It is concluded that midazolam is a satisfactory paediatric premedication agent.", 
    "68": "Several centrally active benzodiazepines (BZ) were tested for their ability to inhibit the TRH-induced secretion of TSH in vitro from perifused pituitaries. Diazepam, flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) and midazolam (10 nM) inhibited the TSH response to TRH (10 nM) by 33-50%, while medazepam, a prodrug having virtually no affinity for central BZ sites, did not. CDZ inhibition was reversed by Ro 15-1788, antagonist of the central type BZ binding sites, but not by PK 11195, antagonist of the peripheral type. The data are consistent with an involvement of central type BZ receptor sites in the TSH-lowering effects of BZ in rats.", 
    "69": "In the present work, we studied the details of the interaction of the nonclassical muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites in rat brain homogenates. Pirenzepine showed biphasic competition curves with a Hill coefficient lower than unity, and these curves were better described according to a two-site receptor model. The affinities and the relative preponderance of these sites were constant at different ligand concentrations, in accordance with a competitive type of interaction. Similarly, pirenzepine did not influence the rate of dissociation of the [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate-receptor complex, even at relatively high concentrations. However, although low concentrations of pirenzepine decreased the affinity of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate for the receptor without affecting the density of the binding sites, higher concentrations of the antagonist decreased the receptor number in a reversible fashion. Schild plots of these data indicated an apparent deviation from simple competition in this experimental design, an observation which can be attributed to the selectivity of pirenzepine for different receptor subtypes. Furthermore, pirenzepine, at concentrations high enough to saturate both its high- and low-affinity sites protected [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites in the brain against irreversible alkylation by propylbenzilylcholine mustard. Therefore, our data support a competitive nature of interaction of pirenzepine with rat brain muscarinic receptors.", 
    "70": "Morphological analysis of brains from rats receiving a convulsant dose of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist, pilocarpine hydrochloride (380 mg/kg), revealed a widespread damage to the forebrain as assessed by light microscopy 5-7 days after seizures. The substantia nigra, olfactory cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, septum, temporal cortex and thalamus underwent prominent morphological injury and cell loss. A concurrent assessment of the activity of L-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) synthesizing enzyme, demonstrated marked deficits in GAD activity in the brain regions undergoing morphological insult. Diazepam, 10 mg/kg, and scopolamine hydrochloride, 10 mg/kg, administered 30 min prior to the injection of pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, prevented acute behavioral and electrographic, and long-term morphological and biochemical sequelae of seizures. These findings suggest that the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, and the anticonvulsant benzodiazepine, diazepam, may aid in preventing extensive brain damage related to pathological muscarinic cholinergic overactivity. The similarity of the topography of the damage and deficits in the GAD activity in brains of rats treated with pilocarpine indicates that GABAergic neurons are lost in the subregions of the brain preferentially sensitive to the convulsant action of pilocarpine.", 
    "71": "The gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) agonist muscimol can be photoactivated by 254 nm illumination to affinity label its binding site in the GABAA receptor. We have conducted this reaction on the pure receptor from bovine cerebral cortex in detergent solution, showing that [3H]muscimol can produce then a specific saturable labeling. In the detergent solution, the receptor alone is sensitive to 254 nm irradiation; this reduces the efficiency of incorporation to below that in the membranes, but the competing photoreaction with [3H]muscimol is sufficient and occurs at a representative set of the muscimol-binding sites, such that it can be employed for the photolabeling of those sites. The affinity of [3H]muscimol displayed in this irreversible reaction is indistinguishable from that of its reversible binding. gamma-Aminobutyric acid and bicuculline compete in the photolabeling reaction according to their known affinities at the gamma-aminobutyric acid-binding site. The labeling is shown to occur at the beta-subunit (apparent Mr 57,000) in the pure receptor. The binding sites for gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists, on the beta-subunits, and the benzodiazepine binding sites, on the alpha-subunits, are linked allosterically so that a strongly cooperative hetero-oligomeric structure of this receptor is deduced.", 
    "72": "We conducted a controlled, statewide trial of the efficacy of an educational visit by a physician counselor in the reduction of diazepam prescribing in outpatient practice. A novel aspect of this trial was the provision of a schedule for gradual withdrawal of long-term diazepam users from drug therapy; 51% of visited doctors attempted to withdraw patients from diazepam therapy and 26% utilized the withdrawal schedule. The entire group of 43 visited doctors reduced the rate of long-term diazepam users in their practice by 18% relative to the control group; the subgroup of doctors who utilized the withdrawal schedule had and even greater reduction of 33%. These results suggest that practicing doctors are concerned with long-term use of diazepam and that the educational visit by another physician is one method for reducing such use.", 
    "73": "The influence of various drugs on the gastric motor inhibition induced by acoustic stress (AS) was investigated in fasted dogs fitted with strain-gauge transducers implanted on the antrum and proximal jejunum at 10 and 80 cm from the pylorus respectively. Started 40-50 min after the last gastric migrating motor complex (MMC), a 1 h acoustic stress delayed by 75% the occurrence of the next gastric but not jejunal MMC and was associated with a 4-fold increase in plasma cortisol. This AS-induced inhibition of the gastric MMC cycle was abolished after previous administration of diazepam (0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg i.m.) or muscimol (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) and partially reduced by a lower dose of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg i.m.); in contrast, it was still present after either naloxone (0.1 mg/kg i.m.), phentolamine (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) or propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) treatment. This selective benzodiazepine or GABA agonist blockade of noise-induced gastric motor alteration supports the hypothesis that release of CRF may be responsible for the gastrointestinal motor effects induced by acoustic stress.", 
    "74": "beta-Carboline (norharman) has been shown to produce kindled seizures when given systemically for long periods of time. The expression of the kindled seizure activity can be blocked by ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor suggesting the receptor as a site of vulnerability in the kindling mechanism. The present data show that Ro 15-1788, a receptor antagonist, suppresses the development of kindled seizures as demonstrated by the delayed appearance of each behavioral stage and the decreased severity of symptoms within each stage. Animals treated with Ro 15-1788 still expressed lower behavioral stages when Ro 15-1788 was eliminated from the trials indicating that this compound suppresses the very process of kindling itself and not just the expression of the kindled seizures. Ro 15-1788 given with norharman causes an increase in Bmax of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine receptor in cortex. It is not known if this increase is instrumental in lowering the kindling rate.", 
    "75": "Pirenzepine is an antimuscarinic drug highly selective for M1 receptors, which proved to be effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer. Aim fo the present study was to assess the frequency of relapses over a 12-month period subsequent to the anatomic healing of duodenal ulcer, obtained with pirenzepine (PRZ). Sixty patients (44 M, 16 F, mean age 42,9 years range 19-73) entered the study. They were allocated at random to a double-blind treatment with placebo or PRZ given at two different dosages, 50 or 100 mg/day respectively, over a consecutive period of 12 months. Clinical evaluations were foreseen every 3 months, while endoscopy and hematology, gastrin plasma levels and intra-ocular pressure assessment at the end of the 6th and 12th month. The intake of antacids or equivalent drugs, in addition to the baseline treatment, was not allowed. Statistical evaluation of the results was performed by chi-square test with Yates' corrections. Difference in percentage of patients without relapses at 6th month and at 12th month was clearly in favour of PRZ compared with placebo. Non changes in the indices of gastrin plasma levels, liver or renal functions and intraocular pressure were reported. No patients complained of side-effects pirenzepine-related. The treatment with full dosage (100 mg/day) did not increase the rate of positive responsiveness compared to that of standard dosage (50 mg/day). It might confirm the importance of the role played by nocturnal acid secretion. For this reason, a decrease in relapses could be expected with the dosage of 100 mg if it was given in a single evening dose. However, therapy with PRZ turned out effective and did not produce side-effects. Its selectivity avoided clinical effects related to a cholinergic system block.", 
    "76": "The analgesic efficacy of the kappa-opioid benzodiazepine, tifluadom, was examined in squirrel monkeys using electric shock titration and tail-immersion procedures. Tifluadom produced dose-dependent increases in the shock intensity that maintained responding under the shock titration schedule without substantially decreasing response rates. Tifluadom also increased the latency of tail-withdrawal from 55 degrees C water. Naloxone attenuated tifluadom's effects under both procedures. These results extend previous reports of tifluadom's analgesic characteristics and suggest that the tail-immersion procedure is a useful analgesic assay in squirrel monkeys.", 
    "77": "Intravenous anaesthesia with a combination of ketamine (Ketalar) and midazolam (Dormicum) infusions was administered to a 49-year-old patient, with a documented history of opiate allergy, undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. A ketamine infusion supplemented with indomethacin suppositories was used for postoperative pain control.", 
    "78": "Sensitive and specific monoclonal radioimmunoassays (RIA) for pirenzepine, a muscarinic receptor (M1) antagonist, were developed and validated for rapid automated routine analysis of plasma and urine samples from clinical studies. Three discrete stable hybridoma clones secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to pirenzepine were produced by fusing the myeloma line X63-Ag8.653 to spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized with pirenzepine-5-N-propionate-protein conjugates. Of three carrier proteins investigated (HSA, BSA and edestin), optimal humoral immune responses and affinity of hybridoma antibody were attained using HSA. All three MAb displayed high affinity to pirenzepine (Ka = 0.6-1.2 X 10(9) l/mol) but showed differing cross-reactivities with its 4'-N-desmethyl metabolite (less than 1%, 6% and 40% respectively). The MAb with essentially zero metabolite cross-reactivity, 58-7/7, was selected for RIA development. In comparison, eight rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against pirenzepine-5-N-propionate-HSA or pirenzepine-5-N-butyrate-HSA possessed a similar range of affinities to the MAbs, but none approached MAb 58-7/7 in specificity. The bridge length had no significant effect on antisera characteristics. Competitive solid-phase RIAs for pirenzepine in human plasma and urine were established using MAb 58-7/7 and [3H]pirenzepine as tracer. All fluid transfers were automated using a programmable sample processing system (Microlab 2,000). Detection limits were 0.25 ng/ml (plasma) and 4 ng/ml (urine) in 0.1 ml sample. The coefficient of within-assay variation was 4% or better in the range 2-100 ng/ml (plasma) or 30-1,000 ng/ml (urine), the between-assay CV was 5.3% or better in the range 5-90 ng/ml (plasma) or 40-660 ng/ml (urine). Excellent correlation was observed between the plasma monoclonal RIA and the hitherto used polyclonal RIA (n = 106, r = 0.994), and between the urine monoclonal RIA and HPLC (n = 82, r = 0.998). We expect that these assays will prove valuable in pharmacokinetic and pharmacological investigations of pirenzepine."
