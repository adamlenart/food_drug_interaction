    "1": "In a prospective trial a consecutive series of 72 adult patients underwent analgosedation during painful interventions. A radiologist performed the analgosedation, the patients received a combination of a shortly effective piperidine derivative (Alfentanil [Rapifen(R)]; 7.5 - 15 microgram/kg body weight) and Benzodiazepine (midazolam [Dormicum(R)]; 20 microgram/kg body weight). After pre-procedure oxygenation patients were continuously monitored. Pain and discomfort were scored using an established visual-analog pain score (0 - 10). A control group (n = 24) had received midazolam, pentazocine or fentanyl according to the study protocol.", 
    "2": "All procedures could be carried out by an interventional radiologist and a nurse and/or technologist only. In 69/72 cases adequate analgosedation could be achieved. Injection of alfentanil was titrated, with a rapid onset and short acting effect of the analgesia. Patients reported an average pain score of 2.6 vs. 4.5 in the control group. Over 55 % experienced no or mild pain (score 0 - 3), in the control group only 8 % reached this level.", 
    "3": "A combination of shortly effective alfentanil and midazolam allows interventional radiologists to perform major procedures alone under effective analgosedation. This medication scheme is superior to the medication upon demand.",

Papers written in English between 1995 and 2000 are reviewed. Procedures are included for the analysis of the following halogen-containing or derivatizable compounds in common biosamples, such as whole blood, plasma, or urine, and in alternative matrices such as sweat, hair, bone, or muscle samples of humans or rats: benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, opioids, acetylsalicylic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ketoprofen, methylphenidate enantiomers, tegafur, zacopride, anabolic steroids, chlorophenols, chlorpyrifos, hexachlorocyclohexanes, organochlorines, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The principal information on each procedure is summarized in three tables to facilitate the selection of a method suitable for a specific analytic problem.", 
    "5": "Publications focusing on the analysis of postmortem specimens for the presence of drugs were reviewed with particular reference to systematic toxicological analysis. Specimens included blood, liver, other solid specimens, and fly larvae. Extraction techniques published during the past 10 years most commonly used traditional solvent extraction techniques. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled to multichannel wavelength detection was most commonly used, which would easily lend itself to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. There were few practical differences in the assays validated for a range of postmortem specimens to those in other forms of forensic toxicology, unless substantially decomposed tissue was used. When putrefied specimens were analyzed, a back-extraction or other form of specimen cleanup was recommended to reduce interfering substances. Many immunoassays designed for urine have been adapted for use in blood and tissue homogenates. Immunoassays designed for blood analysis, however, are likely to have more useful cutoff values than immunoassays optimized for urine testing. Postmortem specimens provide less stability for a number of drugs than other types of specimens. This is particularly a problem for cocaine, heroin, and some antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines. A number of artifacts occur postmortem, which affects the concentration of drug in specimens. This includes postmortem redistribution for drugs with a high tissue concentration relative to blood. Consequently, the likely extent of any change in concentration is relevant to the interpretation of doses and drug effects.", 
    "6": "The effect of molecular packing on flunitrazepam's ability to interact with bio-membranes was studied using dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monomolecular layers at the air-water interface as a model membrane. Flunitrazepam penetrated from the subphase into monolayers at lateral pressures below 44.8 mN/m and induced their concentration-dependent expansion. As inferred from the values of compressibility modulus, the elasticity of the liquid-condensed phase decreased in the presence of flunitrazepam. Although this drug hardly penetrated into high-packed monolayers, it was easily incorporated in the low-packed ones at an extent sufficient to reach the partition equilibrium. Below a molecular area of 75 A(2), contrary to what would be expected, the drug surface concentration increased as a function of surface pressure, suggesting that after its penetration in disordered phases, it became energetically or physically trapped in newly-formed liquid condensed clusters. The phenomenon of flunitrazepam penetration and release would have different energy barriers depending on the membrane phase-state.", 
    "7": "There is a general need to terminate seizures as soon as possible using anticonvulsant drugs via an intravenous (i.v.) route, but it is often difficult to achieve a secure i.v. line during the seizure, especially in children. However, it has been demonstrated that high volumes of fluid can be injected into the corpora cavernosa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the absorption properties of diazepam (DZ) after intracavernous (i.c.) administration and whether therapeutically significant plasma concentrations can be obtained or not.", 
    "8": "Diazepam was administered to rabbits using both the i.v. and i.c route with a dose of 1 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected from the saphenous vein for a time period of 30 min. The levels of DZ in the blood were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and their blood profiles were obtained and compared.", 
    "9": "The insertions of the needle using this method were successful in all cases. The average time of inserting the needle was less than 5 s. There was no statistically significant difference between the i.v. and i.c. administration with regard of the blood DZ levels. Within 48 h after the experiment, none of the animals demonstrated any evidence of infection or disability.", 
    "10": "Our results demonstrated that commercially available parenteral DZ can be absorbed rapidly by the i.c. route in rabbits. Further studies are needed on the feasibility of this method before it is evaluated in humans.", 
    "11": "Oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to excitotoxic insults mediated by AMPA receptors and by low and high affinity kainate receptors, a feature that is dependent on Ca(2+) influx. In the current study, we have analyzed the intracellular concentration of calcium [Ca(2+)](i) as well as the entry routes of this cation, upon activation of these receptors. Selective activation of either receptor type resulted in a substantial increase (up to fivefold) of [Ca(2+)](i), an effect which was totally abolished by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX or by removing Ca(2+) from the culture medium. Blockade of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels with La(3+) or nifedipine, reduced the amplitude of the Ca(2+) current triggered by AMPA receptor activation by approximately 65%, but not that initiated by low and high affinity kainate receptors. In contrast, KB-R7943, an inhibitor of the plasma membrane Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger, solely attenuated the rise in [Ca(2+)](i) by approximately 25% due to activation of low affinity kainate receptors. However, oligodendroglial death by glutamate receptor overactivation was largely unaffected in the presence of La(3+) or KB-R7943. These findings indicate that Ca(2+) influx via AMPA and kainate receptors alone is sufficient to initiate cell death in oligodendrocytes, which does not require the entry of calcium via other routes such as voltage-activated calcium channels or the plasma membrane Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger.",

Another subset of medications-buprenorphine for opiate detoxification, take-home naloxone for overdose prevention and substitute prescribing of levo-alpha-acetyl-methadol (LAAM), heroin and dexamphetamine-garnered less support, but the majority of participants rated even these therapies as acceptable. Ultra-rapid detoxification under sedation was the intervention rated as least acceptable to, and was one of the two least frequently available from, responding NHS services.", 
    "16": "Differences among specific medications notwithstanding, a wide range of harm-reduction and abstinence-orientated interventions were acceptable to and available from NHS services. Acceptance and availability are probably limited by a combination of practical, economic, safety, efficacy and theoretical considerations.",

    "20": "The annual mortality rate was 1.2%, about six times higher than that for a general, age-matched population. Fourteen per cent of the deaths were due to self-inflicted injuries, accidents or violence and 18%, were due to medical causes. The majority of deaths (68%) were associated with drug overdoses. Opiates were the drugs most commonly detected during post-mortem examinations. In the majority of cases, more than one drug was detected. Polydrug use and, specifically, heavy drinking, and use of benzodiazepines and amphetamines, were identified as risk factors for mortality. Anxiety and homelessness were also predictive of increased mortality.", 
    "21": "We suggest that drug misusers and those working with drug misusers need to be more alert to the risks of polydrug use, including the combined use of alcohol with illicit drugs. The study revealed inconsistencies in the recording of drug-related deaths on death certificates. The routine recording of all substances detected during toxicological examination would improve the accuracy of death certification.",

    "31": "The effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on the isolated, nonprecontracted perforating branch of the human internal mammary artery (HIMA) was investigated. ACh induced concentration-dependent contractions of nonprecontracted rings with denuded endothelium (pEC(50) = 6.72 +/- 0.02, E(max) = 88.8% of contractions induced by phenylephrine, 10(-5) mol/l) and was without effect on arterial segments with intact endothelium. An inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), or indometacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, had no effect on acetylcholine-induced contractions of rings of the perforating branch of HIMA with denuded endothelium (pEC(50) = 6.76 +/- 0.03 and 6.62 +/- 0.05, respectively). In the presence of indometacin, ACh did not evoke contractions of arterial segments with intact endothelium. In contrast, in the same type of preparations ACh induced contractions in the presence of L-NMMA (E(max) = 34%). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine (no selectivity), pirenzepine (M(1)), methoctramine (M(2)), and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (M(1)/M(3)) competitively antagonized the response to ACh. The pA(2) values were 9.60 +/- 0.10, 6.99 +/- 0.02, 6.37 +/- 0.17, and 8.02 +/- 0.06, respectively. In conclusion, the results obtained indicate that secretion of nitric oxide from vascular endothelium may protect the perforating branch of HIMA against the contractile effects of ACh. On the basis of differential antagonist affinity, it can be suggested that the muscarinic receptors involved in the ACh-induced contractions of the isolated perforating branch of the HIMA are predominantly of the M(3) subtype.", 
    "32": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a potential mediator of gastrointestinal vasodilatation during digestion. To determine whether CCK influences sympathetic vasomotor function, we examined the effect of systemic CCK administration on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), lumbar sympathetic nerve discharge (LSND), splanchnic sympathetic nerve discharge (SSND), and the discharge of presympathetic neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. CCK (1-8 microg/kg iv) reduced MAP, HR, and SSND and transiently increased LSND. Vagotomy abolished the effects of CCK on MAP and SSND as did the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (0.5 mg/kg iv). The bradycardic effect of CCK was unaltered by vagotomy but abolished by devazepide. CCK increased superior mesenteric arterial conductance but did not alter iliac conductance. CCK inhibited a subpopulation (approximately 49%) of RVLM presympathetic neurons whereas approximately 28% of neurons tested were activated by CCK. The effects of CCK on RVLM neuronal discharge were blocked by devazepide. RVLM neurons inhibited by exogenous CCK acting via CCK-A receptors on vagal afferents may control sympathetic vasomotor outflow to the gastrointestinal tract vasculature.", 
    "33": "Oxygen radicals and protein kinase C (PKC) mediate ischemic preconditioning. Using a cultured chick embryonic cardiomyocyte model of hypoxia and reoxygenation, we found that the oxygen radicals generated by ischemic preconditioning were H(2)O(2). Like preconditioning, H(2)O(2) selectively activated the epsilon-isoform of PKC in the particulate compartment and increased cell viability after 1 h of hypoxia and 3 h of reoxygenation. The glutathione peroxidase ebselen (converting H(2)O(2) to H(2)O) and the superoxide dismutase inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid abolished the increased H(2)O(2) and the protection of preconditioning. PKC activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased cell survival; the protection of preconditioning was blocked by epsilonV(1-2), a selective PKC-epsilon antagonist. Similar to preconditioning, the protection of PKC activation was abolished by mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blockade with 5-hydroxydecanoate or by GABA receptor stimulation with midazolam or diazepam. In addition, PKC, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels, and GABA receptors had no effects on H(2)O(2) generated by ischemic preconditioning before prolonged hypoxia and reoxygenation. We conclude that H(2)O(2) opens mitochondrial K(ATP) channels and inhibits GABA receptors via activating PKC-epsilon. Through this signal transduction, preconditioning protects ischemic cardiomyocytes.", 
    "34": "In our earlier communication on urea denaturation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), we showed significant unfolding of domain III along with domain I prior to intermediate formation around 4.6-5.2 M urea based on the binding results of domain specific ligands:chloroform, bilirubin and diazepam for domains I, II and III, respectively. Here, we present our results on the salt-induced refolding of the two partially folded states of BSA obtained at 4.5 M urea and at pH 3.5, respectively. Both these states were characterized by significant unfolding of both domains I and III as indicated by decreased binding of chloroform and diazepam, respectively. Salt-induced stabilization of partially folded states of BSA was accompanied by nearly complete refolding of both domains I and III as the binding isotherms of chloroform and diazepam obtained in presence of approximately 1.0 M KCl were nearly identical to that obtained with native BSA at pH 7.4. From these observations, it can be concluded that the anion binding sites on serum albumin are not only confined to domain III (C-terminal region) but few sites are also present on domain I (or N-terminal region) of the protein.", 
    "35": "Increased binding sites for \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) ligands have been described in a wide range of neurological disorders including both human and experimental epilepsy. This study was undertaken to assess PTBR expression in relation to the presence of hippocampal sclerosis in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). For this purpose, hippocampal CA1 subfields were dissected from surgical samples from patients with therapy-refractive TLE with (n = 5) or without (n = 2) hippocampal sclerosis and from age-matched nonepileptic postmortem controls (n = 5). PTBR expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Receptor sites were evaluated using an in vitro binding assay and the selective PTBR ligand [3H]PK11195. Epileptic patients with hippocampal sclerosis showed increases in PTBR binding sites, immunoreactivity, and mRNA expression compared to both nonsclerotic TLE patients and postmortem nonepileptic controls. Induction of PTBR expression and binding sites were directly correlated with the presence of hippocampal sclerosis and the accompanying reactive gliosis.", 
    "36": "The glutamatergic system has received considerable attention over recent years as a potential target for anxiolytic drugs. In spite of the pronounced anxiolytic-like effects of competitive and non-competitive antagonists of NMDA receptors in animal models of anxiety, these substances can not be regarded as potential anxiolytic drugs, mainly due to their side-effect profiles (eg, ataxia, myorelaxation, impairment of learning and memory processes and psychotomimetic effects). Antagonists and partial agonists of the glycine, receptor inhibit function of the NMDA receptor complex and evoke in animals an anxiolytic-like response. Although data concerning anti-anxiety-like effects of glycine, receptor antagonists are not very promising, studies are underway to develop new, brain-penetrating agents devoid of side effects. Further developments are necessary to more fully elucidate the possible involvement of AMPA/kainate receptors in anxiety. The recent discovery of metabotropic glutamate receptors, which modulate the function of the glutamatergic system, offers new hope for discovery of a new generation of anxiolytics. MPEP, a highly selective, brain penetrable, noncompetitive mGlu5 receptor antagonist, evokes anxiolytic-like effects in several animal models of anxiety, remaining remarkably free of side effects. LY-354740, a selective brain-penetrable group II mGlu receptor agonist, evokes marked anxiolytic-like effects in animal models of anxiety. LY-354740 causes mild sedation in mice, does not disturb motor coordination and has no potential to cause dependence. Therefore mGlu receptor ligands may become the anxiolytics of the future, free from the side effects characteristic of benzodiazepines.", 
    "37": "An overview of the preclinical literature on the effects of the most studied clinically effective or putative non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics in existing animal models of anxiety-like behavior indicates that, with the exception of 5-HT1A agonists, these compounds display highly variable effects. Because these drugs have been shown (selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors) or proposed (CCK(B) and CRF antagonists) to have a different spectrum of therapeutic activity in anxiety disorders than benzodiazepines, agents mainly used against generalized anxiety disorder, the screening of such compounds clearly requires the validation of new techniques that may model aspects of these conditions.", 
    "38": "Current consensus on the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the form of exposure and response prevention (ERP). However, the generalizability of these methods to elderly populations remains largely undocumented. This clinical case study examines the effectiveness of medications and intensive, inpatient ERP in an elderly patient with onset of OCD following basal ganglia infarcts. There was a dramatic reduction from baseline to follow-up in both obsessions and compulsions with Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [YBOCS; Goodman et al., 1989] total scores decreasing by over 20 points. These gains were maintained up to 1 year post-treatment. Age-specific issues and the application of standard therapeutic methods to elderly clients are discussed.", 
    "39": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that is reduced in several neuropsychiatric disorders that are characterized by deficits in inhibition or gating of intrusive or irrelevant stimuli. Clinically, panic disorder (PD) patients have been described as having difficulties in inhibition of responding to sensory and cognitive events. Because such difficulties may be due to failures in early stages of information processing, we examined PPI in patients with PD. Acoustic startle reactivity, habituation, and PPI (30-, 60-, 120-, 240-, and 2,000-ms interstimulus intervals) were assessed in patients with panic disorder (m/f = 10, 10) and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (m/f = 11, 10). PD patients were assessed with structured clinical interview for DSM-IV criteria with benzodiazepine treatment as an exclusion criterion. Panic disorder patients exhibited normal startle reactivity, reduced habituation, and significantly reduced PPI in the 30-, 60-, and 240-ms prepulse conditions. Within the PD group, the patients with high trait and state anxiety exhibited less PPI than patients with low trait and state anxiety. Furthermore, in PD patients, decreased PPI correlated significantly with high trait but not state anxiety. These data indicate that early stages of sensory information processing are abnormal in patients with PD. These observed deficits in PPI could reflect a more generalized difficulty in suppressing or gating information in panic disorder. The correlation between high trait anxiety and deficient PPI supports the hypothesis that sensorimotor gating abnormalities are an enduring feature of subjects with PD.", 
    "40": "The present study investigates the effect of Ocimum sanctum seed oil (OSSO) on some immunological parameters in both non-stressed and stressed animals. An attempt has also been made to explore the possible mechanism of immunomodulatory activity. OSSO (3 ml/kg, ip) produced a significant increase in anti-sheep red blood cells (SRBC) antibody titre and a decrease in percentage histamine release from peritoneal mast cells of sensitized rats (humoral immune responses), and decrease in footpad thickness and percentage leucocyte migration inhibition (LMI) (cell-mediated immune responses). Restraint stress (RS) produced a significant reduction in the anti-SRBC antibody titre, foot pad thickness and percentage LMI (% LMI). The effects of RS on humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses were effectively attenuated by pretreating the animals with OSSO. Co-administration of diazepam (1 mg/kg, sc), a benzodiazepine (BZD), with OSSO (1 ml/kg, ip) enhanced the effect of OSSO on RS-induced changes in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Further, flumazenil (5 mg/kg, ip), a central BZD receptor antagonist inhibited the immunomodulatory action of OSSO on RS-induced immune responsiveness. Thus, OSSO appears to modulate both humoral and cell-mediated immune responsiveness and these immunomodulatory effects may be mediated by GABAergic pathways.", 
    "41": "The objective of the present investigation was to study the reversible cardiac arrest (RCA) to visual stimuli in the unrestrained Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as well as the modulation of this response and its behavioral component (arousal/orientation or startle response) by external and internal factors that interfere with alertness and emotionality. The study was preceded by the determination of the autonomic receptors that contribute to the establishment of the heart rate (HR) and the RCA. Systemic injection of atropine and propranolol showed that a double cardiac autonomic control is present in the tilapia. Basal HR was 79.8+/-1.8 beats min(-1) and HR assessed after double autonomic blockade was 74.1+/-3.3 beats min(-1). The mean interbeat interval was 0.79+/-0.40 s during baseline recording and the magnitude of RCA induced by a moving shadow (2.67+/-0.22 s) was higher than that induced by light (1.53+/-1.11 s). RCA is peripherally mediated by muscarinic receptors for it is abolished by atropine but not by propranolol. Stressful conditions like handling the animal outside the water or a nociceptive stimulus (subcutaneous 2% or 3% formalin injection) reduced the cardiac interbeat interval. A subanesthetic dose of barbiturate (5 mg kg(-1)) inhibited RCA induced by a moving shadow stimulus and the startle response, suggesting that an ideal degree of vigilance is necessary for its occurrence. Benzodiazepine injections (1.0 and 2.0 mg kg(-1)) abolished the reduction in magnitude of RCA induced by handling stress and facilitated the startle response, seen in the dry-cold season, in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that drugs that act on alertness and on emotionality modulate the magnitude of cardiac interbeat intervals and the corresponding behavioral response.", 
    "42": "Withdrawal of medical interventions has become common in the hospital for patients with terminal disease. Despite the widespread feeling that medical interventions may be futile in certain patients, many patients, families, and medical staff find withdrawal of care difficult and withdrawal of mechanical ventilation to be the most disturbing secondary to the close proximity of withdrawal and death. Presented is a 6-year retrospective review of elective withdrawal of life-sustaining mechanical ventilation on a chronic ventilator unit (CVU) in an academic nursing home. Of the 98 patients admitted to the 19-bed CVU during this period, only 13 underwent terminal weaning (TW). Statistically, these 13 patients did not differ significantly in age, gender, race, route of nutrition, decisional capacity, or length of stay on the unit compared with the 85 patients who were not terminally weaned (t-test P > .05). Stepwise logistic regression found that patients who were more alert at admission were more likely to have participated in TW (chi2 = 5.22, coefficient for alertness P < .036). The decision to terminate mechanical ventilation was made by patients in eight cases and by family in five cases. The first step in the process leading to TW was a discussion with the patient and family about plan of care, including the patient's desires for attempted resuscitation, rehospitalization, advance directives, and family contacts. Plan of care was reviewed informally in a weekly multidisciplinary round and formally, to address each patient's care plan, in a multidisciplinary family meeting on a regular basis. The second step was to address TW when brought up by the patient, family, or medical staff. A request for TW by a patient or surrogate was referred to the medical staff, who screened the patient for depression or other remediable symptoms. The third step was to refer the patient and family to another formal meeting to discuss the request for TW and, if needed, in the case of multiple family members, to allow questions to be answered and consensus to be formed. Additional meetings were scheduled as needed. The next step occurred once a consensus was reached to proceed with TW; a date and time was set to reconvene the patient, family, and anyone else who wanted to be present at the TW. The TW process began when a peripheral intravenous catheter was placed and the patient was premedicated with low doses of morphine sulfate and a benzodiazepine. After premedication, the patient was removed from the ventilator. The physician, nurse, family, and physician assistant remained at the bedside and additional morphine or benzodiazepine was given, as needed, for symptom management. Death from TW occurred in all patients, at times ranging from 2 minutes to 10.5 hours (average 6.2 hours). A mean total dose of 115 mg morphine and 14 mg diazepam was given for symptom control. There was no correlation between dose of these medications and duration of survival off the ventilator.", 
    "43": "The extensive use of benzodiazepines has been a concern of healthcare providers and policy makers in Canada and around the world. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends in benzodiazepine prescriptions dispensed in older people from 1993-1998.",

The annual rates of switching to other psychotropic agents were examined for those patients that discontinued filling benzodiazepine prescriptions.", 
    "48": "The annual prevalence of benzodiazepine prescriptions dispensed decreased consistently over time (25.1% in 1993 to 22.5% in 1998; P < .001). Benzodiazepine dispensing prevalence increased with increasing age (approximately 20% of those age 65 to 69 to approximately 30% of those age > or =85; P < .001) and more females than males received the medication (relative risk = 1.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.49-1.51). The ratio of short- to long-acting benzodiazepine prescriptions filled increased over time (3.6 in 1993 to 5.8 in 1998; P < .001), in line with guideline recommendations. Rates of switching to antidepressants increased over time (8.5% in 1993 to 10.2% in 1998; P < .001), whereas switching to barbiturates was consistently low (0.12%; P = .403).", 
    "49": "The prevalence of benzodiazepine therapy for older people in Ontario has steadily declined between 1993 and 1998. There is a trend of dispensing relatively more short-acting than long-acting benzodiazepines and of replacing benzodiazepines with antidepressants in older people without a remarkable increase in barbiturate consumption. These findings suggest that, without undue regulation, physicians are making progress in the prescribing of benzodiazepine therapy on the basis of current knowledge available.", 
    "50": "The few reports available on olanzapine in Huntington's disease (HD) are insufficiently documented and/or insufficiently dosed. We describe a 30-year-old woman with genetically confirmed HD who presented with severe chorea. She was not able to eat or dress without help and did not respond to haloperidol; the motor scale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS-I) revealed 65 of a possible 124 points. After admission, we treated the patient with a high dose of olanzapine (30 mg daily). The chorea almost ceased in the next 2 days, she was able to eat and walk without assistance (UHDRS-I of 21 points), and fine motor tasks improved, as well as gait and eye movements. This effect lasted for 5 months. We conclude that high-dose olanzapine appears to be useful in grave choreatic attacks.", 
    "51": "It has been suggested that the atypical antipsychotic drugs may induce a rapid improvement in individuals with melancholic depression. This might reflect a specific or non-specific effect on mood and other parameters. To examine this issue, ten consecutive patients, for whom olanzapine augmentation was judged a clinically appropriate strategy, were asked to complete daily ratings of depression severity and component features for 1 week. Of the six rapid responders, there was a 52% group improvement in the first day and 89% improvement at 1 week. Item analyses suggested the most rapid impact was evident for insomnia, compared to a slower and linear improvement in depressed mood. Such findings may assist in an understanding of the mechanisms underlying augmentation with atypical neuroleptic drugs.", 
    "52": "To more clearly clarify the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics compared to conventional antipsychotics, we add data on the outcome of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia from two large, international clinical trials comparing olanzapine with haloperidol (n = 1996) and olanzapine with risperidone (n = 339). Both studies comprised double-blinded, placebo controlled, random assignment trials. Health outcomes reported include: (i) time to discontinuation in the trial; (ii) clinical relapse; and (iii) time to drug non-compliance. When outcome was measured as time to discontinuation due to adverse events or lack of efficacy, olanzapine showed superiority over haloperidol and no difference compared to risperidone. Of those patients who had an initial response, there was no significant difference between olanzapine and haloperidol when outcome was measured using either: (i) 52-week relapse rates or (ii) time to first non-compliance. Using the measures of study discontinuation, relapse and non-compliance, in one trial the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was superior to haloperidol, while in a second trial there were no differences between olanzapine and risperidone.", 
    "53": "To compare the relative effectiveness of a benzodiazepine (clonazepam), a muscle relaxant (cyclobenzaprine), and a placebo for the treatment of jaw pain upon awakening, when each is combined with the recommended nonpharmacological components of initial medical management.", 
    "54": "Forty-one subjects were recruited with a diagnosis of myofascial pain based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). All subjects were given education about TMD and a self-care program. Subjects were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: clonazepam (0.5 mg/night), cyclobenzaprine (10 mg/night), or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the subjects' average intensity of jaw pain upon awakening over the prior week. This was recorded with a visual analog scale at pretreatment and at the completion of the 3-week trial. A secondary outcome measure was sleep quality based on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index.", 
    "55": "Within-group changes showed a statistically significant (P < .001) decrease in jaw pain upon awakening for all 3 groups. Between-group differences demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < .016) between cyclobenzaprine and placebo, and between cyclobenzaprine and clonazepam. There was no significant effect on sleep quality in any group.", 
    "56": "This study suggests that cyclobenzaprine is statistically superior to either placebo or clonazepam when added to self-care and education for the management of jaw pain upon awakening. Based on the subjects' report of sleep quality, these medications failed to significantly improve sleep in the short term.", 
    "57": "Novel and classic neuroleptics differ in their effects on limbic striatal/nucleus accumbens (NA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopamine turnover, suggesting differential effects on implicit and explicit learning as well as on anhedonia. The present study investigates whether such differences can be demonstrated in a naturalistic sample of schizophrenic patients.", 
    "58": "Twenty-five inpatients diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenic psychosis and treated for at least 14 days with the novel neuroleptic olanzapine were compared with 25 schizophrenics taking classic neuroleptics and with 25 healthy controls, matched by age and education level. PFC/NA-dependent implicit learning was assessed by a serial reaction time task (SRTT) and compared with cerebellum-mediated classical eye-blink conditioning and explicit visuospatial memory. Anhedonia was measured with the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure Scale (SHAPS).", 
    "59": "Implicit (SRTT) and psychomotor speed, but not explicit (visuospatial) learning were superior in the olanzapine-treated group as compared to the patients on classic neuroleptics. Compared to healthy controls, olanzapine-treated schizophrenics showed similar implicit learning, but reduced explicit (visuospatial) memory performance. Acquisition of eyeblink conditioning was not different between the three groups. There was no difference with regard to anhedonia and SANS scores between the patients.", 
    "60": "Olanzapine seems to interfere less with unattended learning and motor speed than classical neuroleptics. In daily life, this may translate into better adaptation to a rapidly changing environment. The effects seem specific, as in explicit learning and eyeblink conditioning no difference to classic NL was found.", 
    "61": "Prior experience of withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment reduces the aversiveness of withdrawal when precipitated withdrawal is made the US in a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. Some accounts of US pre-exposure reducing its effectiveness in CTA postulate that US pre-exposure leads to the formation of associations with the environment, resulting in blocking of taste conditioning, but a test of a blocking explanation failed to provide support for such an account.", 
    "62": "The present experiments tested alternative explanations.", 
    "63": "Male mice (C57BLx129sv derived) made dependent upon diazepam (15 mg/kg per day, SC) were subjected to precipitated withdrawal with IP flumazenil (20 mg/kg) as the unconditioned stimulus (US) in a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm, in which sucrose was the conditioned stimulus (CS). The conditioning trial took place in either the same or different environment from that in which the mice had received pre-exposure to the withdrawal US.", 
    "64": "No evidence was found that a place conditioned to withdrawal was capable of supporting a second-order CTA. A second experiment showed that whether withdrawal supported a CTA depended upon whether the previous experience of withdrawal had been predicted by an environmental stimulus.", 
    "65": "Prior experience of an unpredictable aversive US disrupts the subsequent formation of a CTA to the same US. Since prior experience of withdrawal, if it was predictable by an environmental event, did not prevent withdrawal from being a US in a subsequent CTA experiment, withdrawal retains its aversive nature even following prior experience. An explanation in terms of the nature of US predictability following repeated withdrawal from diazepam is consistent both with the current data and our previous findings.", 
    "66": "The mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (mPBR) is involved in a functional structure designated as the permeability transition pore, which controls apoptosis. Binding of Fas/APO-1/CD95 triggers a prototypic apoptosis-inducing pathway. Using four different human tumor cell lines (T-cell Jurkat, neuroblastoma SHEP, osteosarcoma 143N2, and glioblastoma SNB79 cell lines), all of which express CD95 and mPBR, we investigated the potential role of mPBR ligands in CD95-induced apoptosis. We show that, in vitro, the three mPBR ligands tested (RO5-4864, PK11195, and diazepam) enhanced apoptosis induced by anti-CD95 antibody in Jurkat cells, as demonstrated by mitochondrial transmembrane potential drop and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, RO5-4864, but not PK11195 or diazepam, enhanced anti-CD95 apoptosis in all other cell lines. These effects were obtained in Bcl-2-overexpressing SHEP cell lines, but not in Bcl-X(L) SHEP cell lines. Enhancement of anti-CD95 antibody-induced apoptosis by RO5-4864 was characterized by an increased mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO proteins and an enhanced activation of caspases 9 and 3, suggesting a mitochondrion-dependent mechanism. Preincubation of cells with the different mPBR ligands or anti-CD95 did not affect the levels of expression of either mPBR or CD95. In vivo, we found that the RO5-4864 mPBR ligand significantly increased the growth inhibition induced by two chemotherapeutic agents, etoposide and ifosfamide, using two human small cell lung cancers xenografted into nude mice. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands may therefore act as chemosensitizing agents for the treatment of human neoplasms.", 
    "67": "Significant distress is experienced by patients, families, and caregivers when a symptom or disorder, such as an agitated delirium, becomes an intractable, or a catastrophic event, such as irreversible stridor. When palliative sedation is indicated for these patients, midazolam is usually the preferred drug. In some cases, however, midazolam fails to provide adequate sedation. Two cases are presented to illustrate this phenomenon and explore the possible mechanisms underlying this lack of response. These mechanisms appear to be multifaceted. The heterogeneity of the GABA(A) receptor complex and the alterations that this complex can undergo functionally can explain, to some degree, the diversity of the physiological and pharmacological outcomes. Other factors responsible for the diversity in response may include concomitant medications, age, concurrent disease, overall health status, alcohol use, liver disease, renal disease, smoking and hormonal status. Evidence-based guidelines on alternative treatment options should midazolam fail are required. In the interim, a lower threshold for adding an alternative drug, such as phenobarbital, or substituting midazolam with another drug, such as propofol, should be considered in these circumstances.", 
    "68": "The 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084 was examined in various anxiety tests at doses based on reversal of mCPP-induced hypoactivity (0.1--3 mg/kg ip). In the elevated plus-maze task, SB-242084 exhibited signs of anxiolysis (time spent, distance travelled, and entries into open arms), but this was potentially confounded by its general increase of locomotion; alprazolam selectively affected open-arm parameters. In a Geller--Seifter conflict test, SB-242084 produced a modest, nonsignificant increase in punished responding compared to the significant effect produced by diazepam. None of the treatments significantly affected unpunished responding. In the conditioned emotional response (CER) test, SB-242084 produced an increase in the suppression ratio (SR, smaller than diazepam). Since this 5-HT2C antagonist also increased lever pressing, an additional test was conducted with amphetamine that stimulated lever pressing but, nonetheless, failed to produce any change in SR. In the fear-potentiated startle task, SB-242084 was inactive in comparison to a significant effect of diazepam. The previously described reduction of schedule-induced polydipsia by fluoxetine and 5-HT2C receptor agonist Ro60-0175 was attenuated by SB-242084 pretreatment, however, the latter compound exhibited a potent increase in polydipsia when given alone. The present results demonstrate an anxiolytic potential of SB-242084, as well as an intrinsic response-enhancing property, however, both of these effects are task dependent.", 
    "69": "An ideal anticonvulsant drug would prevent or inhibit excessive pathological neuronal discharge without interfering with physiological neuronal activity and without producing untoward effects. Such an ideal compound is not yet available. However, during the last few years several new anticonvulsants have appeared (e.g. vigabatrine, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, felbamate and oxcarbazepine) which may challenge the older, more established substances (i.e. phenytoin, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate, carbamazepine and ethosuximide). Interestingly, several of the old and new anticonvulsants are beneficial in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions (most notably mood disorders) as well as neuropathic pain. The reason these various drugs are effective in the treatment of such disparate clinical conditions is unknown. The answer may be that the neuronal dysfunctions underlying these conditions are similar in a mechanistic sense, but are manifested in different neurons/locations of the nervous system, or that the drugs possess several mechanisms of action that contribute in different ways to the favourable effect depending on the condition studied. Even though all these drugs inhibit excessive neuronal activity, this acute effect appears to be produced by several mechanisms, which fall into three major categories: (1) blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels; (2) indirect or direct enhancement of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABAergic] neurotransmission; or (3) inhibition of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. Moreover, several of these drugs fall into more than one category, and it is often unclear which category is responsible for a given effect of a drug. It is plausible that some of the beneficial effects observed in the clinic can be explained by the secondary neural depressant mechanisms of action of these substances, whereas other benefits may be due to long-term neuroplastic effects, which may either be common or different across the various conditions treated.", 
    "70": "The case of a 77-year-old woman who was found dead in her bathtub with her head clearly above the water line is presented. The decedent had a medical history of depression, liver disease, spinal stenosis, and diabetes mellitus. An empty medication bottle of triazolam was found in the trashcan. At autopsy, no injury or evidence of drowning was found. Toxicological analysis identified triazolam at a concentration of 0.12 mg/L in the heart blood. Triazolam and alpha-hydroxytriazolam were quantitated in the specimens received. The medical examiner ruled that the cause of death was triazolam intoxication and the manner of death was suicide.", 
    "71": "The aim of this study was to further clarify the relationship between emotional stress and bruxism. In experiment 1, 60 male 9-week-old Wistar rats were divided into four groups: the emotionally stressed (ES), the emotionally non-stressed (NS), the electrically foot-shocked (FSd), and the non-foot-shocked (NSd). ES rats were confined in a communication box for one hour a day to observe the emotional responses of neighbouring FSd rats. On days 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12, the electromyographic activity of the ES and NS rats' left masseter muscles was recorded for one hour, three hours after confinement in the communication box. Brux-like activity appeared in the masseter muscle of the ES group on days 1, 4, 8, and 12, but not in the NS group. In experiment 2, 36 male Wistar rats, 9 weeks old, were divided into three groups: emotionally stressed rats treated with an anti-anxiety drug (DES), emotionally stressed rats treated with saline as a vehicle (VES), and 24 FSd rats. Stress and EMG procedures were the same as those in experiment 1. Brux-like episodes decreased in DES rats from day 1 and significant differences were found on days 4 (P < 0.01), 8 (P < 0.05), and 12 (P < 0.05), when compared with the VES group. These findings suggest that emotional stress induces brux-like activity in the masseter muscle of rats, which was reduced with anti-anxiety drugs.", 
    "72": "Remifentanil is a new, short-acting opioid that is similar pharmacodynamically to currently available opioids but differs in its pharmacokinetics. In the present study, we compared the use of remifentanil with the use of meperidine during intravenous conscious sedation for third molar surgery.", 
    "73": "Forty patients who were scheduled for the removal of impacted third molars were randomly assigned to undergo 1 of 2 intravenous conscious sedation techniques. For both groups, 50:50 nitrous oxide oxygen were administered via nasal hood, and midazolam was titrated to Verril's sign. Twenty patients each then received either remifentanil 0.05 microgram/kg/min or meperidine 50 mg. Both patients and surgeons were blinded to the narcotic that was used. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were determined before sedation and every 5 minutes during surgery. Recovery was measured using serial Trieger tests every 5 minutes after surgery. Patient and surgeon satisfaction of the quality of sedation was measured with a visual analog scale.", 
    "74": "Peak heart rate (91 beats/min for remifentanil vs 107 beats/min for meperidine, P <.01) and peak systolic blood pressure (131 mm Hg for remifentanil vs. 142 mm Hg for meperidine, P <.05) were significantly lower for the remifentanil group. Although there was a trend toward increased surgeon satisfaction with remifentanil (86 of 100 with remifentanil vs. 73 of 100 with meperidine), it was not found to be statistically significant. Likewise, other physiologic parameters were not found to be statistically significant.", 
    "75": "The lower peak heart rate and systolic blood pressure levels indicate that remifentanil may allow for less fluctuation in cardiovascular parameters. This could prove beneficial in patients with cardiovascular compromise.",

After 6 weeks, there was statistically significant improvement on most measures for the overall group of patients, however there were few differences between treatment groups. Isolated treatment differences were observed for the patient self-report of overall sexual function (olanzapine superior to placebo) and the structured interview sexual satisfaction item (mirtazapine inferior to placebo).", 
    "79": "No drug assessed was consistently associated with differences from placebo. The results of the study do not support uncontrolled reports of efficacy for these agents in premenopausal women.",

    "81": "The study was conducted at three adolescent psychiatric departments in two mental health centers in the Tel Aviv area. All patients were Jewish Israelis. Weight and body mass index (BMI) of hospitalized adolescents treated with olanzapine (n = 21), risperidone (n = 21), or haloperidol (n = 8) were prospectively monitored on a weekly basis for the first 12 weeks of treatment. Various clinical risk factors were tested for association with weight gain.", 
    "82": "The olanzapine and risperidone groups experienced significant weight gain between baseline and endpoint (p < .01), whereas the average weight of the haloperidol group did not change. Average weight gain was significantly higher for the olanzapine group (7.2 +/- 6.3 kg, 11.1% +/- 7.8%) than for the risperidone (3.9 +/- 4.8 kg, 6.6% +/- 8.6%) and haloperidol (1.1 +/- 3.3 kg, 1.5% +/- 6.0%) groups. Extreme weight gain (>7%) was recorded in 19 patients (90.5%), 9 patients (42.9%), and 1 (12.5%) patient, respectively Gender (males), low concern about gaining weight (females), low baseline BMI, and paternal BMI were positively correlated with weight gain, whereas previous neuroleptic history, neuroleptic dosage, response to treatment, and illness duration were not.", 
    "83": "Olanzapine and risperidone are associated with extreme weight gain in adolescents, much higher than that reported in adults. This side effect should be taken into consideration before prescribing these medications, especially in patients at high risk.", 
    "84": "Lorazepam has been repeatedly shown to induce memory impairments. The effects of this benzodiazepine on the processes involved in the strategic regulation of memory accuracy have not as yet been explored. An experimental procedure that delineates the role of monitoring and control processes was used. Fifteen lorazepam and 15 placebo subjects were examined using a semantic memory task that combined both a forced- and a free-report option and a no-incentive and an incentive condition. Memory accuracy was lower in the lorazepam than in the placebo group. Lorazepam impaired control sensitivity (the extent to which volunteering of answers is affected by the confidence judgments). While the absolute aspect of monitoring was impaired (calibration scores), both the discriminative aspect (the ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers) and the response criterion setting (the confidence threshold set for volunteering a report) were spared. The pharmacological dissociation between monitoring effectiveness and control sensitivity indicates that these two components involve distinct processes.", 
    "85": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is a putative endogenous ligand capable of binding to the central type benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor located on the GABAA receptor and the peripheral type BZD receptor on the mitochondrial outer membrane. We examined the effects of an intracerebroventricular injection of DBI on the serum levels of the gonadal hormones, testosterone and estradiol, respectively, in male and female mice. DBI (0.3-10 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly reduced the levels of both gonadal hormones in a dose-dependent manner. The decrease in the gonadal hormone levels became evident at 1 hr and lasted for at least 4 hrs after the DBI injection. The effects of DBI (3 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.) in male and female mice were completely attenuated by the coadministration of flumazenil (66 nmol/mouse), a selective antagonist for the central type BZD receptor. These results suggest that DBI acts as an endogenous modulator to regulate the levels of gonadal hormones in vivo, and that the DBI-induced decrease in gonadal hormone levels is mediated by down regulation of the GABAergic system, implicated in gonadotropin-releasing systems and/or the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.", 
    "86": "The study was designed to investigate the effect of ketamine on convulsive behaviour using maximal electroshock (MES) test. An attempt was also made to study the possible receptor mechanisms involved. MES seizures were induced in mice via transauricular electrodes (60 mA, 0.2sec). Seizure severity was assessed by the duration of tonic hindlimb extensor phase and mortality due to convulsions. Intraperitoneal administration of ketamine produced a dose-dependent (5-50 mg/kg) protection against hindlimb extensor phase. The anticonvulsant effect of ketamine was antagonized neither by naloxone (low as well as high doses) nor sulpiride, but was attenuated by haloperidol, a dopamine (D2)/sigma receptor antagonist. Co-administration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic drugs (GABA, muscimol, diazepam and baclofen) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (MK801) with ketamine facilitated the anticonvulsant action of the latter drug. In contrast, flumazenil, a benzodiazepine (BZD)-GABAA receptor antagonist, reversed the facilitatory effect of diazepam on the anti-MES effect of ketamine. Similarly, delta-aminovaleric acid (DAVA), antagonized the facilitatory effect of baclofen on anti-MES action of ketamine. These BZD-GABAergic antagonists, flumazenil or DAVA per se also attenuated the anti-MES effect of ketamine given alone. The results suggest that besides its known antagonistic effect on NMDA channel, other neurotransmitter systems i.e. sigma, GABAA-BZD-chloride channel complex and GABAB receptors may also be involved in the anti-MES action of ketamine.", 
    "87": "Release of prostaglandins in brain after spontaneous and experimentally induced seizures, has been demonstrated. The possible role of prostaglandins in modulation of seizure activity is still inconclusive. In the present study, the effects of aspirin and its interaction with the anticonvulsants (diazepam and sodium valproate) were studied in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal electroshock (MES) induced seizures in mice. Aspirin 50, 100, and 500 mg/kg, i.p. was administered 45 min before the pentylenetetrazole (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and MES (60 mA, 0.2 s duration via car clip electrodes) challenge. In MES seizures significant protection was seen with aspirin 100 mg/kg where as higher dose of aspirin 500 mg/kg was required to elicit maximum protection against PTZ seizures. Sub anticonvulsant dose of sodium valproate 150 mg/kg, i.p. and aspirin 50 mg/kg i.p. showed complete protection in MES seizures and the same dose of sodium valproate offered superior protection in PTZ seizures than either drug used alone. When mice were pretreated with combination of diazepam 0.5 mg/kg and aspirin 50 mg/kg protection was significantly enhanced in PTZ seizures. However, aspirin did not show any significant protection with subanticonvulsant dose of diazepam against MES seizures. The present study suggests that prostaglandins may have anticonvulsant potential and also may have modulatory effect on anticonvulsant effect of conventional antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "88": "The child with burns suffers severe pain at the time of the burn and during subsequent treatment and rehabilitation. Pain has adverse physiological and emotional effects, and research suggests that pain management is an important factor in better outcomes. There is increasing understanding of the private experience of pain, and how children benefit from honest preparation for procedures. Developmentally appropriate and culturally sensitive pain assessment, pain relief, and reevaluation have improved, becoming essential in treatment. Pharmacological treatment is primary, strengthened by new concepts from neurobiology, clinical science, and the introduction of more effective drugs with fewer adverse side effects and less toxicity. Empirical evaluation of various hypnotic, cognitive, behavioral, and sensory treatment methods is advancing. Multidisciplinary assessment helps to integrate psychological and pharmacological pain-relieving interventions to reduce emotional and mental stress, and family stress as well. Optimal care encourages burn teams to integrate pain guidelines into protocols and critical pathways for improved care.", 
    "89": "Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency is an inborn error of fatty acid metabolism. The clinical presentation of this disease in children is either a severe form with onset of symptoms in the first months of life, cardiomyopathy, metabolic acidosis, myopathy and a high mortality, or a less severe form manifesting mainly with hypoglycaemia. Perioperative fasting and (even emotional) stress can trigger metabolic decompensation through the altered metabolism of endogenous fatty acids resulting in hypoglycaemia, acute cardiac and hepatic dysfunction and rhabdomyolysis. We report the perioperative management of a 9-year-old boy suffering from the severe form of this disease who underwent circumcision. Metabolism was kept stable in this child by using a glucose--electrolyte infusion throughout the perioperative period to avoid the biochemical consequences of fasting and a benzodiazepine--opioid technique combined with regional anaesthesia to minimize the stress response. Considering reports about a possible interference of propofol with fatty acid oxidation and to avoid the unnecessary administration of fatty acids, propofol should not be used in these patients.", 
    "90": "PRN psychotropic medications (medications given with the aim of changing the patient's mental state on an 'as needed' basis) are frequently prescribed and administered in mental health facilities. Their administration is largely an autonomous nursing role. However, little research has explored this important area of nursing practice in any detail and therefore the use of this intervention by mental health nurses is not fully understood. A descriptive project was undertaken to explore the factors involved in the administration of PRN psychotropic medications. It utilized a retrospective chart audit, conducted at one regional and one urban setting in Queensland, Australia. The results indicate a lack of clarity surrounding psychotropic PRN medication administration practices, confusion surrounding decision-making processes related to this intervention, and poor documentation practices. The study found a high incidence of PRN psychotropic medication administration when compared to similar studies, and an excessive reliance on the use of typical antipsychotics over benzodiazepines. This practice is not supported by contemporary literature. As a result of our findings, we recommend further studies in areas of related importance, in order to increase our understanding of the complexities surrounding this important nursing intervention, and an investigation into documentation practices in inpatient mental health settings.", 
    "91": "Individual benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) binding of peri-lesional cortex was investigated in symptomatic epilepsies. Eleven patients aged 19-44 years were studied whose diagnosis was established by medical history, clinical, electroencephalographic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Three-dimensional [11C]-flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography and MRI scans were obtained and coregistered. Lesions (five low-grade brain tumours, one AV malformation, one cavernoma, one cystic lesion of unknown aetiology, one traumatic brain injury, one post-operative and one post-haemorrhagic defect) were outlined on individual MRI scans. Adjacent to those lesions, and in homologous contralateral structures, FMZ binding was analysed in four pairs of cortical 9 x 9-mm regions of interest (ROIs) placed on transaxial and coronal slices, respectively, as well as in the lesion volume and its mirror region. Percentage asymmetry ratios were calculated and those at or outside the 90-110% range were operationally defined significant. Peri-lesional FMZ binding asymmetries ranged from 70 to 125%, lesional asymmetries from 38 to 82%. Only one patient showed no significant change, whilst nine exhibited significant reductions of FMZ binding in at least one ROI (3 x 1, 4 x 2, 1 x 3, 1 x 4), and significant increases were observed in two ROIs of another patient. Therefore, peri-lesional disturbances of BZR binding are common but variable in location. Because a close correlation between regional decreases in FMZ binding and spiking activity was recently demonstrated in neocortical epilepsies, abnormal peri-lesional FMZ binding may bear some relation to the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in symptomatic epilepsies.", 
    "92": "Cholesterol provided by low- or high-density lipoprotein is the precursor for biosynthesis of progesterone. Once inside the cell, cholesterol can be used for steroidogenesis or esterified with long-chain fatty acids and stored as cholesterol esters in lipid droplets. When it is needed for steroidogenesis, free cholesterol is transported to the mitochondrion via a mechanism that involves cytoskeletal elements and sterol carrier proteins. Cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme complex converts the cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is then converted to progesterone by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5,delta4 isomerase in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Transport of cholesterol from the cytoplasm to the inner mitochondrial membrane is both the rate-limiting step in progesterone biosynthesis and the step most acutely influenced by second messengers. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are involved in this transport. StAR may bind cholesterol in the cytosol and transport it to the mitochondrial membrane where PBR is involved in transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Phosphorylation of StAR by protein kinase A (PKA) stimulates cholesterol transport, whereas phosphorylation by PKC may inhibit this process. Endozepine, the natural ligand for PBR, also appears to be involved in regulation of the rate of cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane and to play a role in the stimulatory effects of PKA on steroidogenesis. Increased concentrations of endozepine were detected in large luteal cells, and may explain the increased progesterone secretion from this type of cell. Fluorescence energy transfer procedures indicate that StAR associates with PBR in mitochondrial membranes. A model is presented for the proposed interactions of StAR, PBR and endozepine in the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane.", 
    "93": "Nonselective inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA-A chloride ion channel enhance cognitive performance in animals but cannot be used in the treatment of cognitive disorders because of anxiogenic and convulsant side effects. We have identified a novel series of GABA-A alpha5 receptor ligands during our search for alpha5 receptor inverse agonists as potential cognition enhancers. In particular, 6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophen-4(5H)-one (26) has been identified as a functionally selective GABA-A alpha5 inverse agonist.", 
    "94": "Gastrin has a growth-promoting effect on the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach but has been claimed also to affect other parts of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. This report describes the effects of the cholecystokinin, (CCK2) receptor antagonists YM022 and YF476 on various growth parameters in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas of the rat. YM022 and YF476 were given subcutaneously in doses known to produce maximum and sustained CCK2 receptor blockade. The body weight was not affected. However, the oxyntic mucosal weight, thickness and protein and DNA contents were reduced by 15-20% already within 1-2 days and by about 30% after 4-8 weeks of CCK2 receptor blockade. Hence, the response of the oxyntic mucosa to CCK2 receptor blockade was in the form of hypotrophy (reduced protein content) and hypoplasia (reduced DNA content). There were no obvious effects of CCK2 receptor blockade on the intestine or pancreas (nor on liver, kidney or thyroid). The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole was used to induce hypergastrinaemia and was given with or without YM022. Omeprazole treatment for 4 weeks increased the oxyntic mucosal weight and thickness by 15-20%. YM022 prevented these effects. We conclude that while elevated circulating gastrin levels, acting on CCK2 receptors, exert a growth-promoting effect on the oxyntic mucosa (but not elsewhere), normal serum gastrin levels exert a mucosa-preserving effect.", 
    "95": "The treatment of aggressive symptoms in schizophrenic patients is a relevant clinical problem. We systematically review the efficacy of the different atypical neuroleptics on acute or persistent aggressive symptoms also regarding methodological problems. Currently typical neuroleptics are still first choice in treating acute aggressive symptoms, while risperidone and olanzapine could be alternatives. In persistent aggression clozapin shows the best specific results. Typical depot neuroleptics should be considered in cases when medication compliance is a problem.", 
    "96": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the stability of diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) in various conditions of temperature and light exposure as might be found in ambulances. Three lots of Diastat (Xcel Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) in various fill/syringe configurations were evaluated in controlled conditions of a freeze-thaw cycle, hard freeze (-30 degrees C for 72 hours), extreme light exposure (1,000 ft candles for 1 month), and long-term evaluation at either 30 degrees C or 40 degrees C. In the various configurations and tests, diazepam concentration always exceeded 95% of label, with no changes of note in excipients or physicochemical properties. The estimated shelf-life at 30 degrees C exceeds 48 months. Based on the results of the present study, the restocking frequency of Diastat in ambient storage conditions (eg, ambulances), could be up to 48 months in nonfreezing environments, as long as this does not exceed the labeled expiration date on the product.", 
    "97": "The present double blind-placebo controlled study was carried out to assess whether melatonin (3 mg p.o., fast release form) could be useful to reduce benzodiazepine dosage in old patients with minor sleep disturbance. The possible correlation of urinary excretion of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) before starting treatment and outcome of treatment was also examined.", 
    "98": "Forty-five patients (36 females, 70.5 +/- 13.1 years old) regularly taking anxiolytic benzodiazepines in low doses were studied. Overall quality of morning freshness, daily alertness, sleep quality, and sleep onset and offset time were assessed from structured clinical interviews and from logs completed by the patients. Patients were randomized to receive either melatonin or placebo for 6 weeks. On day 14 of treatment, benzodiazepine dose was reduced by half and on day 28, it was halted. No significant modifications of sleep or wakefulness were detected after benzodiazepine withdrawal. As compared to basal, there was a general lack of changes in quality of wakefulness or sleep in patients taking melatonin or placebo. Sleep quality of patients taking melatonin during the first two weeks of treatment was significantly lower than that of placebo. Melatonin advanced sleep onset by 27.9 +/- 11.9 min and decreased significantly the variability of sleep onset time (p= 0.03). The urinary concentration of aMT6s prior to the study did not correlate with any parameter examined.", 
    "99": "The present study does not support melatonin efficacy to reduce the use of benzodiazepines in low doses. This contrasted with the demonstrable effectiveness of melatonin to reduce benzodiazepine consumption in insomniac patients when used in hypnotic amounts.", 
    "100": "Four dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists were compared for their ability to protect against the hyperexcitability produced in mice by withdrawal from chronic ethanol treatment and to protect against seizures due to bicuculline or pentylenetetrazol. Comparison was also made of their effects on locomotor activity, body temperature and motor co-ordination, and with the corresponding effects of the benzodiazepine, diazepam. Nitrendipine, nimodipine, nicardipine (at 50 and 10 mg/kg) and isradipine (at 10 and 4 mg/kg) decreased the withdrawal hyperexcitability, but showed no anticonvulsant action against either bicuculline or pentylenetetrazol. Diazepam (1.5 and 4 mg/kg) both protected against the withdrawal signs and decreased seizure incidence after bicuculline and pentylenetetrazol, although the latter effects were of shorter duration than those on the withdrawal signs. The four dihydropyridines decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, an effect which lasted up to 6 h. Only isradipine and diazepam had any ataxic actions at the doses tested. All the dihydropyridines had hypothermic actions, considerably shorter in duration than effects on withdrawal hyperexcitability, with little evidence of dose dependence, except for nicardipine, which had a larger, dose-related, hypothermic action. Of the four compounds, isradipine was more potent in terms of dose, but not any more selective for effectiveness against the withdrawal signs, than the other three dihydropyridines, and nicardipine was slightly less effective in protecting against the withdrawal signs. The results indicate that the anticonvulsant effects of the dihydropyridines were selective for ethanol withdrawal hyperexcitability, whereas diazepam showed no such selectivity.", 
    "101": "Although it has been shown that calcium is involved in the control of the luminous reaction of many invertebrate phyla, its role in Echinoderms is poorly documented. The aim of this work was to carry out a comparative study of calcium requirement of KCl-induced light emission by arm segments and dissociated luminous cells from three ophiuroid species, Ophiopsila californica, O. aranea and Amphiura filiformis. Results show a gradual inhibition of the luminescence when preparations are incubated in artificial sea water with lowered calcium concentration. The calcium substitutes Ba(2+) and Sr(2+) could act either as blockers or as substitutes, depending on the ophiuroid species; while calcium blockers Co(2+), Ni(2+) and Cd(2+) inhibit light emission in A. filiformis and in O. californica, but not in O. aranea. The nature of putative calcium voltage-gated channel has been studied pharmacologically using 1,4-dihydropyridine, benzodiazepine, phenylalkylamine and trifluoroperazine. From our results, it is proposed that calcium could act via an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel in O. californica and A. filiformis but not in O. aranea. The precise role of calcium in luminescence control still remains unknown; it could act as a second messenger or as a co-factor of the luminous reaction.",

All were treated with high-dose suppressive therapy consisting of pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol infusion, or high-dose phenobarbital, either alone, or in combination, for < or =146 days. The overall mortality was seven of 22. Mortality was related to etiology, age, and EEG findings. No death occurred in the remote symptomatic group, and three of four younger than 3 years died, whereas only four of 18 older than 3 years died. The mortality rate among patients with focal abnormalities on the EEG was lower than that among those with multifocal or generalized abnormalities. None of the children with normal premorbid neurologic status returned to baseline.",

    "106": "Whilst the precise mechanism regulating ocular growth is unknown, it has been shown that various pharmacological agents, including the muscarinic receptor antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, are effective at preventing the development of myopia. A recent study, which demonstrated that muscarinic antagonists reduce the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and DNA in chick sclera in vitro, led to the suggestion that such drugs may act directly on the sclera, possibly through a toxic mechanism. Accepted markers of scleral metabolism and cell viability were used in conjunction with a non-invasive, physiological method of ocular growth regulation to determine whether the selective muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine inhibits the development of myopia via toxicity to the sclera. Chicks were monocularly deprived (MD) of pattern vision and given daily intravitreal injections of either pirenzepine (700 microg) or saline vehicle into the deprived eye over 5 days. Unoccluded animals also received intravitreal injections of either pirenzepine or saline into one eye (n=6, all groups). The contralateral eye of all animals was left untreated for comparison. Optical and ocular biometric measures were collected on the final experimental day. Following in vivo delivery of [(35)S] labelled sulphate, levels of sulphate incorporation into scleral glycosaminoglycans were measured in proteinase K digests following selective precipitation with alcian blue dye. The DNA content was also assessed through luminescence spectrometry after binding to Hoechst 33258 dye. To allow comparison with an accepted non-invasive, physiological method of ocular growth regulation, myopia was prevented in additional groups of MD animals by allowing 3hr of unoccluded vision each day, over 5 days, before levels of sulphate incorporation were measured. Scleral DNA content, a marker of cell viability, was not significantly altered between treated and control eyes in any injected group. Relative levels of sulphate incorporation (% difference between treated and contralateral control eyes) were significantly lower in the cartilaginous sclera of pirenzepine-MD animals, compared to saline-MD controls (+35.9 +/- 10.1% vs +121.2 +/- 28.6%, P<0.05), after 2hr of incorporation. However, after 6hr incorporation, there was no significant difference in sulphate incorporation in the cartilaginous sclera between the two groups (+87.2 +/- 33.1% vs +111.0 +/- 14.4%, P=0.53). No significant change was found in the levels of glycosaminoglycan synthesis in the fibrous sclera of any pirenzepine treated group, when compared to the appropriate saline control. Relative patterns of sulphate incorporation, between treatment and control groups, were essentially identical at both time points examined, regardless of whether myopia was prevented through pirenzepine injection or periods of unoccluded vision. The present study shows that, at a dose of pirenzepine sufficient to prevent experimentally-induced axial myopia, glycosaminoglycan synthesis in the cartilaginous sclera was significantly reduced for a transient period following the injection. These pirenzepine-induced reductions in glycosaminoglycan synthesis were not caused by direct drug toxicity to scleral cells as these changes were reversible and no significant reduction in DNA content was observed in pirenzepine treated eyes. Similar patterns of scleral glycosaminoglycan synthesis changes were found following the provision of brief periods of unoccluded vision further demonstrating that pirenzepine is effective in myopia prevention via a non-toxic mechanism. Consequently, the prevention of myopia development in chicks, with either pirenzepine or brief periods of unoccluded vision, is associated with the transient modulation of scleral glycosaminoglycan synthesis in the cartilaginous sclera.", 
    "107": "A survey of clinical and therapeutic evolution in patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic, risperidone or olanzapine, was carried out at La Colombi\u00e8re Psychiatric Hospital, Montpellier. This prospective observational study was conducted over 6 months. Forty-nine patients were included in the olanzapine treatment group and thirty-five in the risperidone treatment group. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was used for evaluation at day 0, 7, 30, 90 and 180 of treatment. The majority of patients were improved after 30 days of treatment, and clinical improvement was observed in about 60 per cent of patients among those treated at day 180. The main therapeutic benefit occurred in respect of positive psychotic symptoms. Patients were discharged after 30 days of treatment. The atypical antipsychotic was not used with an additional neuroleptic for all patients. Tolerance was good, particularly for olanzapine. On the other hand, according to our results, others studies have to be performed to confirm the impact of the treatment on weight gain, assessment of subjective elements such as sedation, and the direct effect of the atypical antipsychotics on primary negative symptoms.",

The mean incidences of malformed fetuses were 47.7% with MeHg (P < 0.001) and 19.2% with PK11195 co-treatment (P < 0.01 for rescue). Cleft palates were 12.8% and 1.5%, respectively. An estimate of neurocranial circumference revealed a small (5%) but highly significant (P < 0.001) reduction that was rescued in a subset of co-treated fetuses (P < 0.05). RT-PCR analysis of the Day 9 forebrain revealed inhibition of 16S rRNA expression 3.0 hr after 5 mg/kg MeHg exposure (P < 0.001). This effect was rescued with PK11195 (P < 0.001). Preliminary findings revealed a similar response-rescue in cultured embryos exposed to 1 microM Hg(II) when exogenous 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was added. Protoporphyrin-IX (PP9), the penultimate precursor to heme and an endogenous ligand of the Bzrp, increased in a manner that was ALA-dependent and PK11195-sensitive.", 
    "111": "At least some teratological effects of Hg appear linked with late steps in the heme biosynthesis pathway through the Bzrp. PK11195, a ligand for these mitochondrial receptors, significantly lessens the risk of microphthalmia, microcephaly, and cleft palate in Hg-poisoned embryos.", 
    "112": "Retinal ganglion cells are driven by glutamatergic synapses, but they are also very susceptible to glutamate toxicity. Whereas the conventional excitotoxicity model of glutamate-induced cell death requires membrane depolarization, we have found that glutamate toxicity need not be linked with excitation. A large subset of ganglion cells possesses high-affinity kainate receptors that are calcium permeable. At 1-5 microM, kainate produced elevation of internal calcium but did not significantly depolarize ganglion cells. This low concentration of kainate caused ganglion cell death, which could be inhibited by specific kainate receptor antagonists. The toxic effect of kainate may be associated with calcium influx, because toxicity was reduced by polyamines that suppress calcium influx and by an inhibitor of calcium phosphatase. Thus activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors can produce neurotoxicity uncoupled from neuroexcitation.",

Results showed that patients taking olanzapine versus risperidone stayed on therapy longer (P < .0001) and were prescribed anti-Parkinsonian medications less frequently (P < .005). Compared with risperidone, olanzapine treatment resulted in lower direct mental health care costs ($1,827 less, P < .03) and lower direct total health care costs ($1,834 less, P < .05). The results of this study suggest that the initial selection of an antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia is important: Olanzapine offset its acquisition cost by reducing medical service costs and demonstrated better drug treatment patterns than risperidone.",

This report reviews indications and choices for pharmacologic treatment of anxiety, delirium, agitation, and provision of anesthesia in critically ill patients. The choice of pharmacologic agents is made difficult by complex or poorly understood pharmacokinetics, drug actions, and adverse effects in critically ill patients.

Birds were housed in ten mixed-sex groups of eight chicks per cage. At 15 d of age, chicks were taken from a randomly selected cage and blood was immediately sampled (undisturbed controls), or they were taken from the same cage and immersed up to their necks in warm water (partial water immersion, PWI) for 15 min before blood was sampled. After blood sampling, forebrains were dissected for preparation of membranes, and bird sex was determined by gonadal inspection. Serum CS levels were determined by a competitive protein-binding assay. CBR densities were determined by radiolabeled receptor binding assay. There were no sex differences in serum CS levels or benzodiazepine receptor densities in controls. Exposure to PWI significantly increased (P < 0.01) circulating CS levels in both sexes, and this elevation was more pronounced (P < 0.01) in males than in females. Male, but not female, chicks also showed a significant stressor-induced increase (P < 0.01) in CBR densities. These findings showed sexual differences in acute, stressor-induced benzodiazepine and adrenocortical responses that suggest broiler males are more stress-susceptible than females.",

Midazolam (6-26 mum) significantly inhibited thromboxane A2 formation stimulated by collagen in human platelets. Moreover, midazolam (15 and 26 mum) dose-dependently decreased the fluorescence of platelet membranes tagged with diphenylhexatriene. Rapid phosphorylation of a platelet protein of Mr 47,000 (P47), a marker of protein kinase C activation, was triggered by collagen (2 microg/ml). This phosphorylation was markedly inhibited by midazolam (26 microm).",

    "136": "2-Chloroadenosine (0.25-1 mg/kg) significantly raised the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice. This preferential adenosine A(1) receptor agonist (at 0.125 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the protective activity of carbamazepine against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice. 2-Chloroadenosine (1 mg/kg) showed also anticonvulsive efficacy against pentylenetetrazol-evoked seizures, raising the CD(50) value for pentylenetetrazol from 77.2 to 93.7 mg/kg. The drug (at 0.5 mg/kg) significantly enhanced the protective action of clonazepam in this test, decreasing its ED(50) value from 0.033 to 0.011 mg/kg. Moreover, aminophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist (5 mg/kg), and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (8-CPX), a selective A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist (5 mg/kg) reversed the 2-chloroadenosine (0.125 mg/kg)-induced enhancement of the protective activity of carbamazepine and clonazepam. 2-Chloroadenosine administered alone or combined with antiepileptic drugs, caused neither motor nor long-term memory impairment. Finally, the adenosine A(1) agonist did not change the free plasma concentration of antiepileptics, so a pharmacokinetic factor is not probable. Summing up, 2-chloroadenosine potentiated the protective activity of both carbamazepine and clonazepam, which seems to be associated with the enhancement of purinergic transmission mediated through adenosine A(1) receptors.", 
    "137": "We evaluated the effects of 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one (CGP-37157) (50 muM), a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, applied topically onto rat cerebral cortex during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Free fatty acid (FFA) levels in cortical superfusates, withdrawn at 10 min intervals from bilateral cortical windows, were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. During a 20 min period of ischemia in control animals, there were significant increases in all FFAs. Following reperfusion, FFA levels remained significantly elevated. Application of CGP-37157 significantly inhibited effluxes of all FFAs during both ischemia and reperfusion. These data indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange likely prevented the activation of phospholipases that usually occurs following an ischemic insult as evidenced by its attenuation of FFA efflux.", 
    "138": "Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings. Affected patients often present with multiple oral complaints, including burning, dryness and taste alterations. Burning mouth complaints are reported more often in women, especially after menopause. Typically, patients awaken without pain but note increasing symptoms through the day and into the evening. Conditions that have been reported in association with burning mouth syndrome include chronic anxiety or depression, various nutritional deficiencies, type 2 diabetes (formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) and changes in salivary function. However, these conditions have not been consistently linked with the syndrome, and their treatment has had little impact on burning mouth symptoms. Recent studies have pointed to dysfunction of several cranial nerves associated with taste sensation as a possible cause of burning mouth syndrome. Given in low dosages, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be effective in patients with burning mouth syndrome. Topical capsaicin has been used in some patients.", 
    "139": "Typological behavior reactions of WAG/Rij rats were studied from the standpoint of divergent modulatory integration hypothesis. This rat strain has a genetically determined dominant dysfunction of the benzodiazepine system of the thalamic nuclei. This disorder provokes an epileptiform disease such as absence epilepsy. It was suggested that the dysfunction of this system would result in a modification of the modulatory systems, which support the motivation states of escape and avoidance reactions as well as of the modulatory systems, which form the emotional states. Modifications of these states are the background of typological behavioral features of WAG/Rij rats. It was shown that WAG/Rij have the lower threshold of the development of haloperidol catalepsy, higher levels of fear and depression. On the first day of training in a shuttle box, WAG/Rij rats demonstrated better avoidance performance than Wistar rats. On the second and 28th days, the amnestic effect of the epileptiform disease was observed. The amnestic effect was also observed after passive avoidance conditioning. The results are discussed in terms of the modulatory integratin hypothesis.",

Mitochondrial dysfunctions lead to various neurodegenerative disorders and to the so-called \"mitochondrial diseases\". A vast amount of evidence points to the implication of mitochondria in such complex processes as apoptosis and cardioprotection. The purpose of this review is to present a recent state of our knowledge and understanding of the action of various therapeutically applied substances on mitochondria. These include antitumor, immunosuppressant, and antiviral drugs, potassium channel openers, sulfonylureas, and anesthetics. Some of these substances are specifically designed to affect mitochondrial functions. In other cases, drugs with primary targets in other cellular locations may modify mitochondrial functions as side effects. In any case, identification of mitochondria as primary or secondary targets of a drug may help us to better understand the drug's mechanism of action and open new perspectives for its application. As far as possible, the molecular mechanisms of the interference of particular drugs in the mitochondrial metabolism will be described. In some cases, metabolic routes in which the drugs interfere will also be briefly outlined.",

Clinical studies have also demonstrated high comorbidity between bipolar disorder and panic disorder, OCD, social phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychobiological mechanisms that may account for these high comorbidity rates likely involve a complicated interplay among various neurotransmitter systems, particularly norepinephrine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin. The second-messenger system constituent, inositol, may also be involved. Little controlled data are available regarding the treatment of bipolar disorder complicated by an anxiety disorder. However, adequate mood stabilization should be achieved before antidepressants are used to treat residual anxiety symptoms so as to minimize antidepressant-induced mania or cycling. Moreover, preliminary data suggesting that certain antimanic agents may have anxiolytic properties (e.g. valproate and possibly antipsychotics), and that some anxiolytics may not induce mania (e.g. gabapentin and benzodiazepines other than alprazolam) indicate that these agents may be particularly useful for anxious bipolar patients.",

Amongst the failed suicide cases there was a higher proportion of women, whereas a higher percentage of men accounted for \"successful\" suicide cases. When examining auto-intoxication cases it turned out that the medicine most frequently used was meprobamate, besides benzodiazepines. Mortality rate was highest in the glutethimide intoxication cases. Most poisonings with suicidal intentions took place in the 2nd quarter of the year. Most completed suicides were committed on Wednesdays and Thursdays. 81% of the iatrogenic intoxication cases happened to be with digitalis and coumarin overdose. Nearly 50% of the cases turned out to be combined intoxications. 40% of the men took alcoholic drinks during the auto-intoxications. In the case of 135 patients extracorporeal detoxification therapy was applied, which consisted mostly of hemoperfusion.

    "175": "The protein p130 was isolated from rat brain as an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein with a domain organization similar to that of phospholipase C-delta1 but lacking PLC activity. We show that p130 plays an important role in signaling by the type A receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Yeast twohybrid screening identified GABARAP (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein), which is proposed to contribute to the sorting, targeting or clustering of GABA(A) receptors, as a protein that interacts with p130. Furthermore, p130 competitively inhibited the binding of the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor to GABARAP in vitro. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that the modulation of GABA-induced Cl- current by Zn2+ or diazepam, both of which act at GABA(A) receptors containing gamma subunits, is impaired in hippocampal neurons of p130 knockout mice. Moreover, behavioral analysis revealed that motor coordination was impaired and the intraperitoneal injection of diazepam induced markedly reduced sedative and antianxiety effects in the mutant mice. These results indicate that p130 is essential for the function of GABA(A) receptors, especially in response to the agents acting on a gamma2 subunit.",

Research findings indicate that surgical and procedural pain can contribute to pathologic pain states related to nerve injury, tissue inflammation, and prolonged peripheral nociceptive input. Animal research findings support clinical practices that avoid the development of these conditions by effectively interrupting ongoing nociceptive input from the injured site.

    "177": "The authors describe five pediatric cases of excessive pemoline ingestion. Based on their experience compared with previously reported cases in the literature, they describe the clinical presentation and rational treatment recommendations for acute pemoline ingestion. Overall, patients experienced a relatively benign clinical course following pemoline ingestion. Symptoms of pemoline ingestion appear to be primarily an accentuation of the drug's pharmacological effects on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems with sinus tachycardia, hypertension, hyperactivity, choreoathetoid movements, and hallucinations being most commonly observed. These findings are consistent with previously reported cases. Possible rhabdomyolysis manifested by evaluation of serum CPK was also observed in 3 of 4 patients in whom this laboratory parameter was measured and appears to be a common finding in acute pemoline poisoning. After acute ingestion, symptoms occurred within 6 hours, lasting up to 48 hours in all patients. Gastric lavage and/or activated charcoal would be effective decontamination measures, whereas ipecac-induced emesis should be avoided after massive ingestion due to the possibility of seizures. Aggressive use of a benzodiazepine appears a reasonable first choice to treat associated involuntary movements, tremor, hyperactivity, irritability, and agitation. Phenothiazines or butyrophenones may also be used especially for serious life-threatening symptoms, including hypertensive crisis and severe hyperthermia, although these serious complications of stimulant overdose have not been reported after pemoline ingestion. If a patient should experience pemoline-induced hypertensive crisis, individual dose titration of labetalol or sodium nitroprusside would appear reasonable pharmacologic approaches for rapid stabilization of blood pressure.", 
    "178": "School refusal anxiety is a pathopsychological disorder which touches the young child, between 8 and 13 years. Even if the school refusal is studied for a long time, there is not still consensus as for the specific definition of this disorder or on the best way of treating it. Nevertheless, accountable of long-lasting difficulties in school integration, its short and medium term consequences are serious and well known: school desertion, mood disorder and behavioral problems. Speed and quality of the medico-psychological and educational interventions represent a important factor for evolution and prognosis. Although, psychological interventions remain essential, sometimes the interest of an associated psychotropic medication should be discussed. This one can indeed either improve their results or supporting their installations. Despite more than twenty controlled trials in the pediatric population, no definitive psychopharmacological treatment data exist for anxiety disorder in childhood and especially for school refusal disorder. The majority of the studies stress as well the interest of benzodiazepines as tricyclic antidepressants but without being able to specify the possible superiority of a chemical on the other. On the other hand, the side effects of each one are well-documented, in particular for the benzodiazepines (potential abuse, sedation, potential desinhibition, mnemonic disorder), limiting thus their uses in child. In this work, we would like to emphasize the interest of propranolol in the treatment of somatic symptoms usually met in school refusal anxiety. Although beta-blockers have been used in the treatment of neurovegetative symptoms associated with situational anxiety disorders, there is no controlled data and only some open data to guide pediatric use for anxiety disorders in children. Nevertheless, prescribed with low posology and in substitution of benzodiazepine, this medication enabled us in three severe clinical cases to shorter notably the time of school rehabilitation. Well tolerated on the clinical level, with a greater efficiency on the somatic signs related to anxiety than benzodiazepines and with not having their side effects, this therapeutic can constitute a significant support in the psychological treatment of these children. However, these present results require to be confirm by other observations, which will be lead perhaps to a controlled study.", 
    "179": "Several studies have confirmed the existence of genetic factors in schizophrenia. However, the genotype predisposing for the disease is not known yet. Nevertheless, those genetic factors in the families of schizophrenic patients urge us to search for genetic vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. Ocular pursuit disorders, in particular, could be one of those vulnerability markers. Eye movements have been often tested in schizophrenia. Most of the schizophrenic patients have eye-tracking disorders and their biological relatives demonstrate an increased prevalence of eye-tracking impairments. The aim of the study was to research if smooth pursuit eye movements could be a vulnerability marker of schizophrenia. In order to have an indication about this hypothesis, impairments of smooth pursuit eye movements were researched in both schizophrenics and their parents.", 
    "180": "Fifteen DSM IV schizophrenic patients stabilized at the time of the inclusion and not treated with lithium, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or chloral hydrate; 19 parents without history of schizophrenic spectrum disorders (SADSLA and IPDE), and 2 groups of healthy subjects matched in age and sex with probands and with the parents, were included in the study. Parents only were included (fathers or mothers) in order to have an homogeneous population for the genetic risk and age. The eye-tracking paradigm used was a smooth pursuit task. The stimulus was a sinusoidal wave form moving on a horizontal line, with a frequency of 0.4 Hz and an amplitude of 30 degrees. Different parameters were measured: gain (ratio between the eye velocity and the target velocity) and saccades frequencies (catch-up saccades, back-up saccades, anticipatory saccades and square-wave-jerks). For each parameter, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with age as covariable was carried out. For the results reaching the significance of 0.05, the Bonferroni correction was applied (level of significance 0.016). The effect size of the parameter was calculated ((the mean of the subjects minus the mean of the matched controls) divided by standard deviation of the two groups). According to Cohen, 0.20 indicates a small effect size, 0.50 indicates a medium effect size and 0.80 indicates a large effect size.", 
    "181": "Comparison between patients and matched controls: the means of global gain, of gain for the movements to the left and of gain for the movements to the right did not differ significantly between patients and their matched controls. The size effects are 0.31 for the global gain, 0.20 for the movements to the left and 0.41 for the movements to the right. The frequencies of total saccades, catch-up saccades, back-up saccades, anticipatory saccades and square-wave-jerks did not differ significantly between patients and their controls. The size effects for those parameters were 0.09, 0.03, 0.00, 0.39 and 0.63 respectively. Comparison between parents and matched controls: the means of global gain, of gain for the movements to the left and of gain for the movements to the right did not differ significantly between the two groups. The size effects for those parameters were 0.00, 0.05 and 0.17 respectively. The frequency of total saccades did not differ significantly between the groups whereas the size effect was 0.63. The frequency of catch-up saccades was significantly more important in parents than in controls (p = 0.006) and the size effect was 0.80. The other saccadic parameters did not differ significantly between groups, their size effects were 0.24 for the back-up saccades, 0.21 for the anticipatory saccades and 0.00 for the square-wave-jerks. Whereas the gain of the patients had a tendency to be lower than the gain of their controls, no significant difference was observed between patients and their controls. Only a size effect of 0.63 for the frequency of square-wave-jerks was obtained. This large effect size suggests that the difference between patients and controls might be significant in a larger sample. The catch-up saccades frequency between parents and controls was significant. The differences between our study and the previous studies could be due to several factors. The paradigms used were different between the studies and our sample was small (only 15 patients and 19 relatives). Moreover, some patients in the previous studies were treated by lithium, drug well known to modify ocular pursuit and, finally the relatives in the other studies were 10 years older than ours and age is known to alter ocular pursuit. Since an impairment of the smooth pursuit was observed in the relatives of schizophrenic patients but not in the probands, this study does not support the hypothesis that eye-tracking disorders could be considered as a marker of vulnerability of schizophrenia.", 
    "182": "Numerous, but heterogeneous studies have been performed about premenstrual syndrome, with finally a lack of credibility and interest among practitioners. More recently with the diagnosis criteria generalization, psychiatrists were more concerned about this syndrome, because of anxiety and mood symptoms involved in social impairment and need of medical care. In 1983 in the United States, the National Institute of Mental Health conference devoted to this topic proposed the first diagnosis criteria, requiring a prospective and daily assessment of the symptoms. In 1987, the American Psychiatric Association, in the DSM III-R, introduced the Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder diagnosis that became in 1994 in the DSM IV the Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, with the same diagnosis criteria. In the literature, prevalence rates are very heterogeneous according to the diagnosis criteria used and to the populations studied. One of the most relevant criteria is the induced impairment, such as avoidance of social activities, or search for medical care. Lifetime prevalence is thus estimated between 75 and 85% if considering the report of one or several symptoms, between 10 and 15% in case of medical care request, and between 2 and 5% in case of social activities interruption. To distinguish isolated complaints from a disabling disorder, self-questionnaires are the best way of assessment in a so complex and changing disease. Most of the epidemiological studies found a positive correlation between the premenstrual dysphoric symptoms and the lifetime major depressive disorder diagnosis. However, recent prospective studies failed to find an association between premenstrual syndrome and an increased risk of major depression. On the other hand, some studies showed that the premenstrual period is a risk period for associated psychiatric disorders exacerbations, as the obsessive-compulsive disorder, more severe alcohol intakes in case of alcoholism, symptoms increase in schizophrenics, or higher rates of suicide attempts. The most widely studied and frequently blamed etiopathogenic hypothesis is the serotonin dysregulation. Serotonin is particularly involved in expression of irritability and anger, but also in occurrence of depressive symptoms and specific food cravings, precisely found in the premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Among their different effects, estrogens increase the density of serotonin receptors and enhance the sensitivity to serotonin agonists. Moreover, some studies found a significantly different response to d-fenfluramine, a serotonin agonist, in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In psychoanalytical theories the premenstrual syndrome was associated to a \"femininity complex\", to an ambivalent pregnancy desire, and to unconscious conflicts relating to sexual preference. In this context, Karen Horney, who took a great interest in the premenstrual period, was radically opposed to the Freudian theory of feminine sexuality, in particular the negation of the female sex. For Karen Homey, the \"desire of penis\" is more expressive of the woman's spite not to share the sexual, but also political, social and cultural benefits fallen to men. To understand the premenstrual period feelings it is also necessary to take into account the personal history of the woman and the psychosocial factors involved, as the social and cultural beliefs, and the mother-daughter communication. Medical cares are necessary when symptoms constitute a severe and disabling disorder. Among non-psychiatric treatments, progesterone was the most widely prescribed treatment, but relating to recent performed studies, it failed to prove its efficiency in such an indication. In the same way, the efficiency of the contraceptive pill was not demonstrated. The most prescribed psychiatric treatments are serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines. First studies showing serotonin re-uptake inhibitors efficiency in premenstrual dysphoric disorder were performed in the beginning of the nineties, with clomipramine and fluoxetine, and later fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram. Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor), showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient than placebo. Low doses of clomipramine (10 to 50 mg per day) seem to be sufficient and it appears also preferable to prescribe an intermittent treatment because of a possible tolerance effect, susceptible to be warned by phases free of treatment. Alprazolam was the most studied benzodiazepine in this indication. Most studies were positive, using daily posologies of 0.25 to 4 mg during the 6 days preceding the menses, with improvement of irritability, anxiety and depressive mood. The general practitioner frequently carries out psychological support, in particular in case of mild symptoms without consequences. Nevertheless, underestimate a more severe psychological suffering is a risk, firstly because there is no systematic interrelationship between the somatic symptoms intensity and the psychological distress, and secondly because premenstrual period is a special emotionally moment to put in evidence psychological or relational disruption. All kinds of psychotherapy can be relevant, even though the training of relaxation techniques is particularly suitable in such an indication. In conclusion, and in spite of the generalization of the diagnosis criteria in the international psychiatric classifications as the DSM, the premenstrual syndrome remains a complex and polymorphous disorder. The premenstrual syndrome was considered for a long time like a somatic disease, but now the psychiatric symptoms severity justifies most often the medical cares. In order to distinguish some isolated and mild complaints, of a disabling disorder, the standardized prospective auto-assessment is the most relevant method. Finally, intermittent prescription of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors appears to be the most effective treatment, the previously used hormonal treatments not having made proof of their efficiency in such an indication.", 
    "183": "Information and reassurance of parents are essential before considering therapeutic measures following a first febrile seizure. It must be emphasized that, although impressive, febrile convulsions are essentially benign, and that in the majority of cases there will be no recurrence. Apart from that, therapeutic measures are of limited efficacy in order to prevent reocurrence. The correct use of antipyretic treatment during febrile episodes must be specified. Due to its several inconveniences, oral diazepam as an intermittent prophylaxis should be only considered in case of multiple reoccurrences. There is little place for continuous anticonvulsant treatment.",

    "187": "In addition to the higher up listed effects clonidine showed a anxiolytic effect, which is comparable to midazolam. Therefore clonidine is an interesting alternative to benzodiazepines, which are commonly used drugs for premedication."
