Radioreceptor binding studies indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites (4860 +/- 875 sites/cell) and affinities of 0.42 +/- 0.12 nM, 176 +/- 32 nM and 13 microM for N-methylscopolamine, pirenzepine and carbachol, respectively. In cells prelabelled with myo-[3H]inositol carbachol induced a dose-dependent increase in inositol-1-phosphate in the presence of lithium with an ED50 of 10 microM which was antagonized by atropine and pirenzepine (IC50 9 and 700 nM, respectively). Carbachol stimulated amino[14C]pyrine uptake, used as a measure of acid secretion, with an ED50 of 10 microM. The good correlation between these responses suggests a role for inositol phosphates in the muscarinic M2-receptor mediated acid secretion.", 
    "1": "Among 9 benzodiazepines, tested on the proliferation of synchronously dividing flagellate cells, only diazepam and medazepam can induce an accumulation of abnormal mitotic figures after 24 h of treatment. It seems that there is not a direct relation between the activity of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system and their ability to inhibit mitosis.", 
    "2": "Affinity column-purified GABA-benzodiazepine receptor protein from bovine brain was photoaffinity labeled with both [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol. Gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed that the benzodiazepine binding site labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam was primarily associated with a major peptide subunit revealed by protein staining with Mr = 52 kiloDaltons, with minor labeling of a second peptide of Mr = 57 kiloDaltons, corresponding to a second major stained band. Covalent incorporation of [3H]muscimol was limited to the 57 kiloDalton band, with no labeling of the 52 kiloDalton peptide, showing that the GABA binding site is carried by a subunit distinct from that carrying the benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "3": "The autoradiographic distributions of receptors with high affinity for [3H]oxotremorine-M (the M2 receptor) and [3H]pirenzepine (the M1 receptor) were studied in the rat brain. M1 receptors were seen in highest density only in telencephalic structures: cerebral cortex (layers I-II), hippocampus, dentate gyrus, medial and basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens and caudate/putamen. M2 receptors were detected throughout the brain, with highest levels observed in cerebral cortical layers III and V, forebrain cholinergic nuclei, caudate/putamen, various thalamic areas, inferior and superior colliculus, interpeduncular and pontine nuclei, brainstem cholinergic nuclei and cervical spinal cord regions. M2 receptors were found to be good markers for cholinergic cell groups and the majority of cholinergic projection areas, whereas M1 receptors were only found in a large sub-group of telencephalic cholinergic projection areas, and the pattern of distribution of receptors in these areas differed from that of M2 receptors. Scatchard analysis of [3H]oxotremorine-M binding to inferior collicular slices revealed one site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.9 nM and a receptor density (Bmax) of 1.4 pmol/mg protein. Our data support the hypothesis that M1 and M2 receptors are physically distinct sub-types of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.", 
    "4": "The density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine (BZ)-binding sites was studied in platelets of 10 medicated chronic schizophrenics with tardive dyskinesia (TD), 10 medicated chronic schizophrenics without TD, 7 drug-free schizophrenics, and 10 normal controls. The age range of the study population was 36-60 years. Age and sex distribution were similar in all 4 groups. The unmedicated schizophrenics did not differ in their maximal binding capacity from the healthy controls. A significant decrease in the density of peripheral-type BZ-binding sites in platelets was observed in treated schizophrenics both with and without TD in comparison to controls and untreated schizophrenics. The reduction in [3H]PK 11195 binding was more pronounced in TD patients (31.3% of controls) than in patients without TD (21.1% of controls). However, this parameter failed to discriminate statistically between TD and non-TD medicated schizophrenics.", 
    "5": "A 10 day estradiol treatment of rats resulted in a marked reduction (43%) in peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites in the testis and an up-regulation (27%) of these sites in the kidney. No significant alterations in brain central BZ receptors and heart peripheral binding sites were observed. The down-regulation of BZ binding sites in the testis may be related to or accompany estrogen-induced testicular atrophy. The physiological and pharmacological implications of the alterations obtained in the kidney are as yet unclear.", 
    "6": "There has been much interest in the biochemical and biophysical processes that couple extracellular signals to alterations in gene expression. While many early events associated with the treatment of cells with growth factors have been described (for example, ion flux and protein phosphorylation), it has proved difficult to establish biochemical links to gene expression. Recently, the study of such genomic control signals has been facilitated by the demonstration that the c-fos proto-oncogene is rapidly and transiently induced by treatment of several cell types with polypeptide growth factors and other growth modulating substances. In one particular system it has been shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) causes a transient induction of c-fos in the phaeochromocytoma cell line PC12, within 15 min. Furthermore, the magnitude of this induction can be modulated with pharmacological agents such as peripheral-type benzodiazepines (BZDs). Thus, the study of c-fos expression in PC12 cells could yield valuable clues to the coupling mechanisms linking cell surface activation to genomic events. Here we demonstrate that c-fos is induced in PC12 cells either by receptor-ligand interaction or by agents or conditions that effect voltage-dependent calcium channels.", 
    "7": "Rats and mice were treated with lorazepam (1.0 mg/kg) or its vehicle. Six h later seizure threshold to i.v. pentylenetetrazole was determined following treatment with the benzodiazepine-receptor inverse agonist FG 7142, the antagonist Ro 15-1788 or a second dose of lorazepam. Although lorazepam alone was anticonvulsant 6 h after its administration, animals pretreated with lorazepam were more sensitive to the proconvulsant action of FG 7142 and less sensitive to the effects of a second treatment with lorazepam.", 
    "8": "Evidence has accumulated suggesting that the presence of calcium is critical for development of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). However, there is a paucity of information about whether calcium's role in LTP is pre- or postsynaptic. In the present study, we examined the effectiveness of nitrendipine, verapamil, flunarizine and the benzodiazepine diazepam in: blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels; blocking synaptic transmission; and preventing development of LTP. Using the in vitro slice preparation, we obtained intracellular and extracellular recordings from guinea pig hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. At the cellular level, all 4 drugs were ineffective in blocking voltage-dependent calcium spikes (TTX resistant) and the calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization. Verapamil and diazepam appeared to antagonize synaptic transmission, as reflected in smaller population spike amplitudes. Development of long-term potentiation was not affected by the presence of verapamil, flunarizine and diazepam. Nitrendipine appeared to reduce the percentage of slices exhibiting LTP; however, ethanol, the vehicle used to dissolve nitrendipine, was shown in separate experiments to reduce the percentage of slices exhibiting LTP. These results suggest that neither the organic calcium channel blockers--nitrendipine, verapamil, and flunarizine--nor micromolar concentrations of diazepam are potent blockers of extrasynaptic voltage-sensitive calcium channels in hippocampus. They thus cannot be used to demonstrate a specific pre- or postsynaptic calcium role in LTP.", 
    "9": "Cholinergic pathways play an important role in the regulation of GH secretion from the anterior pituitary gland, and in this study we have investigated whether cholinergic muscarinic receptor blockade with pirenzepine displayed any inhibitory action on slow wave sleep-related GH release in normal subjects. Six adult males (ages 24-37 years) were studied in a randomized order and fasted from 1800 h on each study day. All subjects showed episodes of slow wave sleep on each occasion and this was followed by peaks of GH release when placebo alone was administered (range of GH peaks 4-50 mU/l). In contrast, pirenzepine treatment (100 mg p.o. at 2200 and 2400 h) completely abolished nocturnal GH release in each individual without altering the occurrence of slow wave sleep itself. These data demonstrate clearly that cholinergic muscarinic receptor blockade completely abolishes slow wave sleep-related GH release in normal adult subjects. Because of the striking effects it is reasonable to conclude that acetylcholine plays an important stimulatory role in mediating slow wave sleep-related GH release. This finding may have investigational and therapeutic applications in young patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus since GH is implicated in some acute metabolic and chronic microvascular complications of this disease.", 
    "10": "To evaluate the influence of beta-blockers and/or minor tranquillizers on autonomic reactions during brief stress, 48 healthy subjects were randomised into 4 groups: A = 4 mg Pindolol, B = 1.5 mg Cloxazolam, C = Placebo, D = 4 mg Pindolol + 1.5 mg Cloxazolam. Subjects underwent four stress situations: Counting, noise, mental arithmetic and ergometry, each lasting 4 min with rest periods of 8 min in between. Electromyogram, finger pulse amplitude, heart rate, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity were recorded simultaneously on-line. Analysis of variance showed that the two drugs had significant main effects in different systems: Pindolol reduced heart rate, mainly during mental arithmetic and ergometry, Cloxazolam reduced electrodermal activity, mainly during noise. It can be concluded that different structured situations with a varying amount and type of anxiety induce different autonomic reactions; these reactions can be differentially modified by the drugs applied.", 
    "11": "In a series of 74 experiments in a double blind study, 25 healthy test persons were medicated with a single dose of Clomipramin, Desipramin, Imipramin, Diazepam, Carbamazepin, Haloperidol, and a placebo. At the end of one hour, and again at the end of three hours, an EEG was made whose frequency analysis revealed significant changes in about half the test persons. The antidepressives induced an increase in the theta waves, the slow alpha waves, and the slow beta waves, and a decrease in the fast alpha waves. The factors influencing the EEG are discussed.", 
    "12": "Diazepam, a well known tranquilizer, and ethinyl estradiol have frequently been prescribed together in rape cases. These two drugs were reported to possess an opposite action on uterine motility. Phenobarbital, a typical enzyme inducer, has been prescribed together with ethinyl estradiol in some cases as a sedative-hypnotic. The present study was, therefore, designed to investigate the possible interferences of diazepam or phenobarbital sodium on postcoital contraceptive efficacy of ethinyl estradiol (4 micrograms/kg/day) in rats. All tested doses of diazepam (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg/day) or phenobarbital sodium (30 and 60 mg/kg/day) appear to have no effect on the efficacy of ethinyl estradiol when either of them was administered from D3 to D5 or from D1 to D5 of pregnancy. In addition, neither diazepam nor phenobarbital sodium at the highest doses used showed an effect on pregnancy.", 
    "13": "Beta-carbolines and indoloquinolizidines occur in plants, and some of the former compounds also in mammalian tissues. Many beta-carbolines cause tremor or convulsions, and they are among the most potent known endogenous compounds to bind to benzodiazepine, tryptamine and serotonin binding sites. In this study seven indoloquinolizidines which are formal derivatives of 1,2-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carbolines were assayed for their affinity for benzodiazepine, tryptamine and serotonin binding sites in rat brain in vitro. Three of them exhibited significant affinity for tryptamine receptors: Ki values ranged from 0.97 microM upwards. The affinity spectra towards different receptors greatly varied from compound to compound showing selectivity to one or several of the binding sites now studied. These derivatives of beta-carbolines may be useful tools when assessing the physiological functions of the tryptamine and other binding sites.", 
    "14": "The thermic response to acute administration of chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was assessed in rats exposed prenatally to haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), phenobarbital (10 mg/kg), nitrazepam (2 mg/kg), propylene glycol (1 ml/kg) or saline, once daily from days 1-21 or 15-21 of gestation. The response in all animals was tested only once. The administration of chlorpromazine to 8- or 13-week-old male and female rats treated with saline (1-21 d) induced marked hypothermia for a 6-hr period of observation. Male and female rats treated with haloperidol (1-21 d) showed a delayed hyperthermic response to chlorpromazine at 8 weeks of age; the males showed an increase in rectal temperature at 3 hr and the females from 3 to 6 hr. Thirteen-week-old males but not females treated with haloperidol (1-21 d) showed a hyperthermic response to chlorpromazine during the first 2 hr. Eight-week-old male and female rats treated with phenobarbital (1-21 d) showed hypothermia, whereas 13-week-old male rats of another group treated with phenobarbital (1-21 d) showed significant hyperthermia after the administration of the chlorpromazine. The hypothermic response of the rats treated with nitrazepam (1-21 d) to chlorpromazine was similar to that in the vehicle (propylene glycol)-treated controls. The male rats treated with phenobarbital (15-21 d) responded to chlorpromazine with significant hyperthermia from 30 min to 1 hr. There was no alteration in thermic response to chlorpromazine in rats born to mothers treated with one tenth of the dose of phenobarbital, haloperidol or nitrazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "16": "This contribution describes a modern technique of producing general anesthesia in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig. The method of anesthesia selected is dependent on the duration and type of surgery. The drugs used to produce anesthesia should not interfere with the experimental aims, therefore only drugs with well known actions and a standardized anesthesiological procedure should be used. Climazolam, Ketamine and atropine are preferred for induction of anesthesia. After endotracheal intubation, inhalation anesthetic mixed with oxygen and nitrous oxide is used to maintain general anesthesia. Controlled ventilation is necessary to prevent the animals from developing respiratory acidosis. Postoperative analgesia is provided by orally administering acetylsalicylate or morphine-sulfate pentahydrate at 12 hour intervals.", 
    "17": "Drug dependence tests on a new intravenous anesthesia inducer midazolam were performed in comparison with triazolam in male cynomolgus monkeys utilizing the intravenous route of administration. In the animals trained to self-administer sodium pentobarbital (0.6-1 mg/kg/inj) under FR1 and FR10 reinforcement schedules, 0.01 midazolam and 0.001 mg/kg/inj triazolam maintained self-administration in more than 4 out of 5 animals under FR1. Doses of 0.03 and 0.001 mg/kg/inj, respectively, were required under FR10. The intradaily progressive ratio test revealed that midazolam maintained self-administration only weakly (equivalently as or more weakly than triazolam did). Midazolam at 0.003-0.1 and triazolam at 0.0003-0.01 mg/kg/inj initiated self-administration, respectively, in 3 and 1 out of 4 naive animals, but the numbers of self-administration responses were only slightly higher than the vehicle control level. Pentobarbital at 0.1-3 mg/kg initiated self-administration in all of 4 animals with a high level of self-administration. In the single dose suppression test in physically pentobarbital-dependent animals, an ED25 value of midazolam for the suppression of the withdrawal signs was 0.30 mg/kg, i.v., which was almost equivalent to that for the central nervous system depression (0.27 mg/kg, i.v.). This was in clear contrast to the results of triazolam and pentobarbital, of which the ED25 values for the suppression were lower than those for the central nervous system depression. In naive animals, after the chronic administration of midazolam at 0.9, triazolam at 0.09, pentobarbital at 60 mg/kg/day (the doses inducing intermediate sedation) intravenously for 4 weeks, withdrawal signs were found respectively in 0, 1 and 3 out of 4 animals. After the chronic administration of higher doses of the compounds (1.2, 0.12 and 80 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks, the withdrawal signs were found respectively in 1 and 2 out of 3 and 3 out of 4 animals. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.v.) precipitated clear withdrawal signs in none of 3 midazolam animals and 2 out of 3 triazolam animals. From these results, it can be concluded that the drug dependence liability of midazolam is within the range of those of most benzodiazepines.", 
    "18": "Buspirone is an atypical anxiolytic drug that exerts its action at a receptor site other than the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ionophore complex. The present study examined the effect of buspirone on plasma prolactin and corticosterone levels in both control and stressed rats. In unstressed rats, buspirone produced dose-dependent increases in plasma prolactin and corticosterone levels. The minimal doses of buspirone which led to significant elevations in plasma prolactin and corticosterone levels were 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg (IP), respectively. The effect of buspirone on both hormones was maximal 30 minutes after injection. The plasma levels of prolactin and corticosterone were significantly elevated in rats that were stressed using a conditioned fear paradigm. Buspirone produced a dose-dependent attenuation of the stress-induced increase in prolactin secretion. The stress-induced increase in corticosterone secretion was inhibited by the 0.5 mg/kg (IP) dose but not by the 2.0 mg/kg (IP) dose of buspirone, which increased corticosterone secretion both in stressed and unstressed rats. These data suggest that the effect of buspirone on plasma prolactin and corticosterone levels may be mediated by two different mechanisms of action.", 
    "19": "Four rats were trained on concurrent schedules of shock avoidance and timeout from avoidance, where responses on one lever postponed shock and responses on another lever occasionally (VI 45 sec schedule) produced a 2-min timeout during which the avoidance schedule was suspended. These procedures maintained stable rates of responding on both levers, providing a baseline for studying the effects of drugs on behavior under different types of aversive control (shock avoidance and timeout from avoidance). In the first experiment the effects of ethanol (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g/kg) and an opiate antagonist, naltrexone (1 mg/kg) were assessed alone and in combination. Ethanol produced a dose-dependent decrease in avoidance characterized by increased shock rates and decreased response rates. At the same time, however, responding on the timeout lever generally increased relative to avoidance lever rates. All of these effects were largely confined to the early parts of the 2-hr session, when blood-ethanol levels were relatively high. Naltrexone had no effect on performances and did not interact with ethanol. In a second experiment, the effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 8216 were studied alone, and in combination with ethanol. CGS 8216 (5 mg/kg) generally disrupted both avoidance and timeout responding but did not reverse ethanol actions.", 
    "20": "The pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216, a high-affinity ligand for benzodiazepine recognition sites, significantly reduced the consumption of a preferred 0.05% sodium saccharin solution in a 30 min two-bottle test. A highly significant effect was detected at 5.0 mg/kg, IP and at higher doses. The consumption of water and 0.6% saline, in two-bottle tests, or of quinine solution and water, in a forced-choice test, was not reliably affected by CGS 8216. The results point to a sensitive and selective intrinsic effect of CGS 8216 on ingestional responses in the rat.", 
    "21": "Hypnotic effects following administration of three doses of pentobarbital were evaluated in mice selectively-bred for differential hypnotic sensitivity to ethanol. Although the ethanol-sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) line displays greater sedation to a wide variety of CNS depressants (alcohols, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, general anesthetics), when compared to the ethanol-insensitive Short-Sleep (SS) line, the response pattern to pentobarbital remains equivocal. Thus, to clarify the effect of pentobarbital, certain variables (dose, sex, circadian rhythmicity) believed to be important in the expression of sleep time were evaluated. For all doses examined \"sex\" and \"time of day tested\" impacted on sleep time. With these provisos, 40 mg/kg consistently induced shorter sleep time in SS mice. The 60 mg/kg dose either failed to distinguish these two lines, or induced greater sleep times in the SS mice. The 80 mg/kg dose tended to have the same effect as the 60 mg/kg dose, but to a greater degree. Overall, it appears that for each line the dose response curve for pentobarbital is sigmoidal, but that the slope of the curve for the middle range of doses is greater for the SS line. Since pentobarbital has a unique effect on these lines of mice that is dissimilar to those reported for other barbiturates, the implication is that an additional factor, that is unimportant for other barbiturates, is essential for pentobarbital-induced hypnosis. Factors that could be responsible for this effect include differential metabolism of Gabaergic receptor dynamics.", 
    "22": "N-Ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) was found to irreversibly decrease the Bmax of [3H](-)-quinuclidinyl-benzilate [(-)QNB] binding in rat brain following in vivo administration or by incubation of tissue homogenates with EEDQ in vitro. A greater reduction in the Bmax of [3H](-)QNB binding was observed in the hippocampus and cortex than in the brainstem following in vivo or in vitro treatment with EEDQ. Competition of pirenzepine for [3H](-)QNB binding was best described by computer-derived models assuming two binding sites in all brain regions. However, following EEDQ treatment there was a rightward shift in the pirenzepine competition curves for the remaining [3H](-)QNB-binding sites in all brain regions. Computer analysis of the pirenzepine competition curves indicated that this was due to a selective decrease in the number of [3H](-)QNB-binding sites having high affinity for pirenzepine. Although the binding of [3H](-)QNB to the site having lower affinity for pirenzepine was apparently unaltered, the affinity of pirenzepine for this binding site was significantly lowered following both in vivo and in vitro treatment with EEDQ. Thus, EEDQ differentially modifies muscarinic receptor-binding sites having high and low affinity for pirenzepine. The reduction in the Bmax of [3H](-)QNB binding and the rightward shift in the pirenzepine competition curve elicited by EEDQ both in vivo and in vitro could be prevented by coadministration of reversible muscarinic antagonists, thereby demonstrating that EEDQ interacts at the ligand recognition site of muscarinic receptors. These data suggest that the putative muscarinic receptor subtypes discriminated by pirenzepine may represent differences in the accessibility of pirenzepine and EEDQ to a homogeneous population of [3H](-)QNB-binding sites or, alternatively, that these muscarinic receptor-binding sites discriminated by pirenzepine and EEDQ represent structurally distinct molecular entities.", 
    "23": "The properties of the specific binding of the muscarinic receptor ligands [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and N-[3H]methylscopolamine in rat brain were compared. The specific binding of both ligands was affected equally by heat, phospholipase A2 and trypsin. N-[3H]methylscopolamine labeled only a fraction of the total muscarinic receptors recognized by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in different brain areas and in the heart. Evidence is presented that N-[3H]methylscopolamine, in fact, binds to a subpopulation of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites. The distribution of the high-affinity binding sites of N-[3H]methylscopolamine did not show a different tissue dependence as compared to the total receptor population, and did not parallel the distribution of the pirenzepine-sensitive M1 receptor subtype. Similarly, the affinity of both [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and N-[3H]methylscopolamine varied from one tissue to another by a maximum of 2-fold. Although (-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate competed for the specific binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in different tissues according to the law of mass-action, N-methylscopolamine showed an anomalous interaction with two binding sites. The low-affinity binding sites of N-methylscopolamine showed saturability of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding and stereoselectivity. When the binding characteristics of these N-methylscopolamine-inaccessible binding sites of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in the brain were investigated further, it was found that N-methylscopolamine bound exclusively with a single low affinity, whereas pirenzepine still interacted with two receptor populations incorporated in these sites. It is concluded from several lines of evidence that the heterogeneity of binding of N-methylscopolamine to muscarinic receptors does not represent an interaction with the muscarinic M1 and M2 receptor subtypes defined by pirenzepine. Thus, the unique binding profile of pirenzepine to muscarinic receptors cannot be explained merely on the basis of its hydrophilic nature.", 
    "24": "Some, but not all studies have reported that a single dose of benzodiazepine affects growth hormone (GH) and cortisol secretion in healthy volunteers. The majority of studies that found GH elevations after benzodiazepine administration did not use placebo trials. The present placebo-controlled investigation determined plasma GH and cortisol levels after intravenous administration of diazepam (0.15 mg/kg) to 10 healthy volunteers. Neither GH nor cortisol secretion changed significantly after diazepam infusion. The lack of placebo trials and the presence of elevated baseline GH values may have been responsible for peak GH elevations reported in previous studies.", 
    "25": "An unconscious victim of an overdose was intubated with an endotracheal tube to prevent aspiration. The respiratory therapist deflated the cuff of the endotracheal tube to allow for a retrograde oral air leak and then tightly attached the oxygen tube directly to the endotracheal tube. Seconds later there was a loud pop as the oxygen tube blew off the end of the endotracheal tube. The patient sustained both a hemodynamic and a neurologic decompensation as the result of marked pulmonary overinflation, with bilateral pneumothoraces and probable cerebral and coronary artery air emboli. We present the case in the hope that it will help avoid any such future occurrences.", 
    "26": "The effect of chronic alcohol intake on anesthetic responses to alcohol, thiopental, or diazepam was examined in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Alcohol-fed animals were maintained solely on a complete balanced liquid diet containing 6.54% ethanol (w/w) for 21 days; pair-fed control animals received equal amounts of the same diet with alcohol isocalorically replaced by sucrose or dextrin. Nine hours after diets were withdrawn on the twenty-second day, the following drug/dose combinations were administered intraperitoneally to separate groups of alcohol-fed and control rats (10-15 animals in each group): ethanol 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0 g/kg; thiopental 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg; and diazepam 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg. Three different responses were assessed in every animal: 1) loss of righting reflex (induction of anesthesia); 2) response to a painful stimulus (analgesia); and 3) sleeping time (duration of anesthesia). Alcohol-fed rats compared with controls were significantly less tolerant of pain at an acute alcohol dose of 2.4 g/kg, and loss of righting reflex and sleeping time were reduced at 4.0 g/kg. All three anesthetic responses were also attenuated in alcohol-fed rats at a diazepam dose of 20 mg/kg. In contrast, none of the three responses was reduced in alcohol-fed rats at any of the three thiopental doses. Thus, chronic alcohol intake sufficient to produce tolerance to anesthetic doses of alcohol in rats also produced cross-tolerance to diazepam but not to thiopental in equianesthetic doses. These results suggest that blanket recommendations for adjusting intravenous anesthetic dosages in alcoholic humans may be inadequate as guides to anesthetic management.", 
    "27": "The effects of anticonvulsant, anesthetic and convulsant barbiturates and of related depressant drugs were characterized on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in slices of rat hippocampus. The duration of recurrent GABAergic inhibition was increased by all of the drugs tested, including the convulsant barbiturate 5-ethyl-5-[1,3-dimethylbutyl]barbituric acid, anesthetic barbiturates such as pentobarbital and nonbarbiturate anesthetics such as (+)-etomidate. Several barbiturates, including phenobarbital and (+)-mephobarbital facilitated inhibition, but the maximal responses to these agents were significantly less than with pentobarbital. In general, there was a good correspondence between the potencies of these drugs in facilitating inhibition and their previously reported abilities to regulate binding at the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine/barbiturate receptor complex. In addition to facilitating recurrent GABAergic inhibition, at successively higher doses most of these drugs induced direct depression of the population spike response, field excitatory postsynaptic potential and presynaptic fiber spike. 5-Ethyl-5-[1,3-dimethylbutyl]barbituric acid, (+)-mephobarbital and pentobarbital facilitated excitatory synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral/commissural synapses on the CA1 pyramidal neurons at low doses, but caused depression at higher doses. The net effects observed with each drug tested (facilitation/depression of excitatory transmission, enhancement of GABAergic inhibition) correlated well with the behavioral effects of these agents in vivo.", 
    "28": "Ten cases are presented--two in detail--in which clonazepam was used successfully in patients with treatment-resistant panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Seven of 10 patients who had been resistant to standard pharmacological treatments of panic attacks and agoraphobia achieved cessation of their attacks while three had mild to moderate symptom persistence. These data underscore other reports of clonazepam's usefulness in the treatment of panic disorder. Clinical use of clonazepam is discussed.", 
    "29": "Effects of buspirone, 10 and 20 mg, and diazepam, 10 mg, on skilled performance and evoked responses, as well as their interactions with 0.8 g/kg of alcohol were investigated in 24 healthy men. Alcohol, 0.8 g/kg, caused the greatest performance impairment, followed closely by diazepam. Both doses of buspirone had lesser effects. Buspirone had primarily sedative effects which were short lasting, whereas diazepam impaired tracking and body balance in addition to being sedative. Both anxiolytics showed only slight additive interactions with the present dose of alcohol. A strong drug effect and a lesser but significant alcohol and a drug/alcohol interaction effect were seen on evoked potentials. Diazepam effects on evoked potentials were similar to alcohol, whereas buspirone in some instances appeared to reverse the alcohol effect. Pharmacokinetics of buspirone and diazepam were not significantly affected by concomitant administration of alcohol. The psychomotor side effect profile of a single anxiolytic dose of buspirone is preferable to a single 10-mg dose of diazepam.", 
    "30": "Forty-eight patients received either naloxone (10 mg), fentanyl (0.1 mg), diazepam (0.3 mg/kg), or saline solution placebo, and then underwent surgical removal of impacted third molars under local anesthesia. Placebo resulted in significantly elevated levels of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (i beta-END), norepinephrine, and anxiety during surgery. Patients receiving naloxone had significantly greater intraoperative i beta-END and pain as compared with those receiving placebo. The naloxone effect on intraoperative pain was a result of a difference in perceived unpleasantness. Both the fentanyl and diazepam groups had significantly lower intraoperative i beta-END and anxiety levels as compared with the placebo group. Norepinephrine levels increased significantly in response to surgical stress in all groups except the diazepam group. Postoperative circulating levels of i beta-END and norepinephrine and pain increased significantly from the 1 to 3-hour postoperative period for all groups, with the exception of stable norepinephrine levels observed in patients receiving diazepam. Results indicate that opiate antagonists stimulate and agonists suppress the release of i beta-END, possibly by affecting the patient's perceived level of pain and anxiety. In addition, the association of intraoperative hyperalgesia with naloxone predosing suggests that endogenous opioid peptides inhibit the perception of intraoperative pain even in the presence of concurrent local anesthesia.", 
    "31": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) uptake by male and female Schistosoma mansoni was studied in vitro. Initial uptake was determined during the first 2 min of incubation with the indoleamine. There were two types of uptake: a saturable component that is apparent at low concentrations of serotonin, and a passive component that predominates at high concentrations. Female S. mansoni take up more 5-hydroxytryptamine per milligram protein than do the males. Studies on the distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine taken up by the parasites show that a large proportion of the indoleamine is in the tegument. The female tegument had a greater proportion of the 5-hydroxytryptamine taken up than did the male tegument. The evidence indicated that 5-hydroxytryptamine associated with tegument represented the passive uptake while uptake in the main parasite body was both active and passive. Compounds that were shown to inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake include methylclonazepam, metergoline, imipramine, and ouabain. Maximal inhibition by these compounds ranged from 50 to 60%. Inhibition appeared to be confined to the saturable uptake component of the body fraction.", 
    "32": "Lamotrigine, a novel anticonvulsant, has been evaluated in patients with epilepsy using the method of interictal EEG spike counting. In a randomised double-blind trial it was found that oral lamotrigine (240 mg) was more effective than placebo, but less effective than diazepam (20 mg) in suppressing interictal spikes. Further clinical evaluation of lamotrigine is recommended in patients with epilepsy.", 
    "33": "Barbiturates and benzodiazepines may be very effective in controlling seizures, especially status epilepticus. However, their chronic use may be associated with serious sedative-hypnotic effects that interfere with cognitive function and behavior. When utilized, patients must be carefully monitored to be certain that these side effects are not occurring.", 
    "34": "The effect of clonazepam on the restless legs syndrome was studied in a group of 6 patients. Following a drug-free period, 3 patients received clonazepam for 4 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks thereafter and 3 patients received the same medication and for the same length of time but in reverse order. The effectiveness of the medication was evaluated by means of a self-rating system in which patients assigned a score daily to the degree of discomfort experienced in the previous 24 hours. Three patients improved on clonazepam but 2 of these also improved on placebo. Clonazepam was not shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of RLS.", 
    "35": "The influence of selected drugs on compensation from unilateral labyrinthectomy was studied in the cat. The drugs investigated included: a. amphetamine, b. diazepam, c. dimenhydrinate, d. scopolamine, and e. trimethobenzamide. The most beneficial drugs for improving recovery were a stimulant (amphetamine) and a general anti-emetic (trimethobenzamide). It is postulated they had this effect by improving the overall activity level with general exercise being a known positive influence. Conversely the other drugs either had little effect on recovery or hindered it, by presumably suppressing the sensory imbalance in the vestibular system that is essential stimulus to ultimate recovery.", 
    "36": "Cytoprotective activity of Pirenzepine (PZ) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was investigated in the gastric damage induced by taurocholic acid (TA) in the rat. Gastric mucosal potential difference (PD) and gross mucosal erosions were measured. Intravenous PZ (18 mg/kg) and PGE2 (5 micrograms/kg) prevented both the sharp decrease of PD and the gastric lesions caused by intragastric TA (40 mM). When TA administration preceeded drug treatment, both compounds reversed the PD fall but only PZ was able to restore gross mucosal integrity. It is thought that TA causes gastric damage by producing back-diffusion of H+ ions across the mucosal layer. It is speculated that antimuscarinic, such as PZ, might reduce gastric damage either by preventing, at the submucosal level, the spreading of cytolesive process triggered by H+ retro-diffusion and/or by inhibition of acid secretion in the depth of the gastric glands.", 
    "37": "A theoretical study is presented concerning DNA-anthramycin adducts. By explicit energy minimisations using a semi-empirical energy formula and an advanced algorithm the structural properties and the energetics of this system are analysed. The results obtained demonstrate that the formation of a covalently bound adduct in which anthramycin is attached to the N2 site of a guanine within a DNA fragment is accompanied by a considerable change in the nucleic acid conformation as confirmed by recent experimental evidence. With the use of the \"SIR\" methodology for treating DNA flexibility the general features of this change are characterised. The sequence specificity of anthramycin binding is investigated and the important role of sequence dependent nucleic acid flexibility brought to light. This theoretical treatment thus provides new elements for the interpretation of the origins of ligand binding specificities.", 
    "38": "The clinical effects of flunitrazepam (FNZ) as IV sedative agent for spinal anaesthesia was studied. Of 112 elderly patients undergoing hip surgery, 40.2% have required a total dose of 26.6 +/- 2.3 mcg X kg-1. The repeat doses were 9.3 to 13.3 mcg X kg-1. A good state of sedation was obtained in 81% of patients, with a linear relationship between narcosis states and FNZ's doses. In 93% of cases, FNZ was provided peroperative amnesia without post-operative somnolence. No clinically adverse cardiovascular effects were encountered. There was a small, but statistically significant increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension. In summary, FNZ provided useful sedation.", 
    "39": "Seven volunteers received diazepam for a 3-week period, maximum dose rate 25 mg per day, and were tested on a variety of functions before, at two points during, and at two points after the period. Their performance was compared with that of 8 controls and was inferior on a number of measures. There was no indication either of habituation or of potentiation of the effects as the period continued. Equally, the low performance persisted for some time after administration ceased, although performance was on the whole better than during the experimental period. The particular measures showing deterioration suggested that the effects are similar to those of barbiturates as opposed to those of, for example, chlorpromazine.", 
    "40": "Sorption of nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, diazepam, and clomethiazole edisylate (chlormethiazole) to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) i.v. administration sets with and without cellulose propionate burettes and to polybutadiene (PBD) sets with and without methacrylate butadiene styrene (MBS) burettes was studied. All drugs (except chlormethiazole) were diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (NS) in glass bottles or in the burette chambers. Initial samples of each solution were obtained from the bottle or from the burette, and effluent samples were collected at various times up to 240 minutes from the sets without burettes and up to 90 minutes from the sets with burettes. For nitroglycerin, flow rates of 0.5 and 1.0 mL/min were used without the burette. The effect of priming the tubing before adding drug to the burette was studied for diazepam. Triplicate samples were analyzed for nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate by high-performance liquid chromatography and for diazepam and chlormethiazole by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Up to 50% potency of chlormethiazole and nitroglycerin, 15-25% of isosorbide dinitrate, and 13-20% of diazepam was lost to PVC sets without burettes, and an additional 10-15% loss of each drug resulted when PVC sets with burettes were used. Less sorption of nitroglycerin to the PVC sets occurred at the higher flow rate, but flow rate through the PBD sets did not affect sorption. Priming the tubing before adding diazepam to the burette did not affect final drug delivery. No loss to PBD sets was observed for nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, and diazepam; loss of chlormethiazole to PBD was 7-13%. Drug potency in effluent from PBD sets was not affected by presence or absence of a burette.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Treatment of SE has improved considerably during the last decade. Mortality from SE itself should be minimal if effective treatment is delivered rapidly. Currently, the risk of complications from appropriate treatment is less than the risk of injury from additional seizures. Loading with phenytoin, 20 mg per kg, using benzodiazepam if needed, is the current treatment of choice. If seizures persist, phenobarbital 10 to 20 mg per kg should be used. If convulsive SE continues for more than 1 hour, pentobarbital coma is necessary.", 
    "42": "A case of advanced gastric cancer associated with metastatic carcinomatosis of the bone marrow, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was reported. A 71-year-old woman complained of lumbago and general fatigue. At the time of admission, besides anemia, jaundice and a tendency to bleeding, the laboratory data showed, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated FDP and hemolytic anemia with fragmented red cells. The bone marrow was infiltrated by carcinoma, and an upper GI series examination showed Borrmann II type gastric cancer on the greater curvature of the antrum. After remission of both MAHA and DIC by mitomycin C, neothramycin and FOY, the patient successfully underwent subtotal gastrectomy. However, she died of cerebral hemorrhage on the 96th postoperative day.", 
    "43": "The effects of the anticonvulsant drugs valproic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbital and diazepam were examined in pigeons performing under a fixed-consecutive-number schedule with and without an added external discriminative stimulus. Under these schedules, a reinforced response run consisted of responding between eight and 12 times on one response key (work key) and then responding once on a second response key (reinforced key). For one group of pigeons, an external discriminative stimulus signaled completion of the response requirement on the work key, whereas no stimulus change was programmed for the other group. Phenobarbital (5-60 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5-6 mg/kg) produced large decreases in reinforced response runs (accuracy) and rates of responding. The magnitude of these accuracy- and rate-decreasing effects was larger in the group without the external discriminative stimulus. Under both schedules, these drugs produced pronounced increases in the probability of switching to the reinforcement key before completion of the minimal response requirement on the work key. Valproic acid (20-160 mg/kg) and phenytoin (1.25-10 mg/kg) also decreased both accuracy and rates of responding. Although the accuracy-decreasing effects of these drugs were relatively small in magnitude, they were consistently larger in the group without the external discriminative stimulus. These data suggest that the addition of an external discriminative stimulus attenuates the disruptive behavioral effects of anticonvulsant drugs.", 
    "44": "The effect of 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam was assessed in a double-blind add-on trial in 20 patients with chronic complex partial seizures uncontrolled by maximally tolerable daily dosage of standard antiepileptic drug therapy. The number of seizures was lower during the three months of active treatment. At the end of the third month, eight (40%) of the patients had a seizure reduction by more than 75%, including four patients (20%) who had complete control. Tolerance to the antiepileptic effect of clobazam was noted in 56% of the patients, and mild transient sedation occurred in 40% of the patients. Despite these drawbacks, clobazam is an effective add-on drug for individual patients with refractory focal epilepsy.", 
    "45": "Tifluadom dose-dependently induced diuresis in rats after subcutaneous injection and oral application. (+)Tifluadom was at least 100-fold more potent than the (-)enantiomer in inducing diuresis. The diuretic action of tifluadom was dose-relatedly reduced by the opioid receptor antagonists naloxone and MR 2266. Naloxone methobromide did not antagonize the diuretic effect of tifluadom nor did the benzodiazepine receptor blocker Ro 15-1788. These data demonstrate that the diuretic effect of tifluadom is mediated centrally via an agonistic interaction between the drug and opioid receptors.", 
    "46": "Diazepam (DZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) were tested for their ability to antagonize LiCl-established conditioned taste aversions (CTAs) to saccharin in a two-bottle free-choice paradigm. CTAs to saccharin were established in male Sprague-Dawley rats on a chronic fluid-deprivation schedule by the administration of LiCl (3 mEq/kg, IP) following a forced-choice exposure to a novel saccharin solution (0.1%, w/v). Three days later, rats were provided with a two-bottle choice presentation of saccharin and distilled water. Conditioned rats drank distilled water almost exclusively while unconditioned animals preferred saccharin. Pretreatment with DZ (6, 9, 12 mg/kg, IP) and CDP (12 mg/kg, IP) significantly increased the saccharin intake of conditioned rats indicating an attenuation of the manifestation of the CTA. While these results are consistent with the known disinhibitory effects of benzodiazepines, alternative mechanisms involving polydipsia or interactions with the taste characteristics of saccharin could not be excluded. Both hypertonic saline (16%, w/v NaCl) and Barbital Sodium (100 mg/kg) produced polydipsia without attenuating CTAs suggesting that the two-bottle procedure is capable of distinguishing between polydipsic effects and anti-aversion effects for these drugs.", 
    "47": "Autoradiographic studies reveal densities of binding to somatostatin, neurotensin, mu-opiate, and benzodiazepine receptors in substantia nigra specimens from neurologically normal human brains. Binding to nigral angiotensin converting enzyme is also dense, whereas more modest densities of kappa-opiate, dopamine, and serotonin receptors are noted. In nigral specimens taken from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, substantial reductions in somatostatin, neurotensin, mu-opiate and kappa-opiate receptors contrast with more modest reductions in dopamine and benzodiazepine I receptor subtypes. Angiotensin converting enzyme, serotonin, and benzodiazepine II binding are virtually unaltered. These results underscore the likelihood of strong peptidergic influences on normal and pathologically altered human nigrostriatal circuitry.", 
    "48": "Some 3-amino- and 3-hydroxy-8-halosubstituted 6H-indolo[2,3-b] [1,8]naphthyridines were synthesized and tested for their affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor in bovine cortical membranes. All prepared compounds were more active than the corresponding 8-unsubstituted derivatives. Moreover, among these compounds the 8-chloroindolonaphthyridines were clearly the most potent.", 
    "49": "The effect of the irreversible opioid receptor antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), on antinociception produced by mu- and kappa-receptor agonists was studied in the rat. beta-FNA, 20 to 80 mg kg-1, s.c., given 24 h before testing, produced a dose-related antagonism of the effects of morphine in the paw pressure, hotplate and tail-flick tests. Following the 80 mg kg-1 dose, the degree of antagonism of morphine was stable for up to 48 h after dosing, but was reduced by 5 days and had disappeared by 8 days. In the paw pressure test, beta-FNA, 40 mg kg-1, s.c., antagonized the effects of fentanyl, buprenorphine, tifluadom, ethylketocyclazocine and proxorphan; it was without effect against the highly selective kappa-agonist, U-50,488. In light of these results, the possible opioid receptor selectivities of both the agonists and beta-FNA are reassessed.", 
    "50": "The action of agents which bind with the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor has been investigated by use of intracellular recordings from dissociated mouse neurones grown in tissue culture. The agents tested were midazolam (an agonist at the BZ receptor) and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM-an inverse agonist at the BZ receptor). These were applied to the neurone under study by one of the following methods: iontophoresis; pressure application of known concentrations from blunt pipettes; directly in the perfusing medium. On only very few occasions did midazolam or DMCM have a direct effect on the membrane potential (EM) or conductance (GM) of the impaled neurone. For the neurones where direct effects were present, there was no consistent pattern of response. Neither substance affected the threshold for action potential generation. The effect of midazolam and DMCM on responses evoked by iontophoretic application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was also investigated. Three parameters were used to quantify GABA responses: the depolarization (VGABA); the increase in GM (gGABA) measured with constant current pulses; using voltage clamp, the GABA current (IGABA). The GABA response should be quantified by a parameter which is linearly related to the number of GABA-operated channels which are conducting at any instant. VGABA does not fulfil this criterion. gGABA is an appropriate parameter, but is difficult to determine for large responses where the membrane is nearly short circuited. IGABA measured during voltage clamp fulfils this criterion. Midazolam (greater than 10(-6) M) reliably potentiated GABA responses with a parallel shift to the left of the dose-response curve. This is in agreement with biochemical studies where BZs increase the affinity of the GABA receptor for its ligand. The effect of DMCM on GABA responses was more variable. In the majority of cases GABA responses were reduced by DMCM. The threshold dose for this depression was usually around 10(-6) M, but was sometimes as low as 10(-8) M. Dose-response curves of IGABA or gGABA showed the inhibition to be of a non-competitive nature. The maximum inhibition achieved was around 70%. For a given neurone, and at doses which did not necessarily cause a reduction of the response to GABA, DMCM could antagonize the potentiating action of midazolam on GABA responses. A possible interpretation is that more than one BZ site per receptor complex must be occupied by a BZ agonist (or inverse agonist) before the functional changes for the complex as a whole can occur. Desensitization to GABA was increased by midazolam.", 
    "51": "Cyclic AMP has been suggested as a possible intracellular mediator in bone remodeling during tooth movement. Accordingly, an increase in the level of this nucleotide should result in faster tooth movement. Breakdown of cAMP was inhibited by administration of diazepam in eight cats undergoing orthodontic tooth movement; another matched group of eight animals served as controls. Orthodontic appliances consisted of coil springs stretching between the right side maxillary and mandibular canines and third premolars. The data for tooth movement and cAMP concentrations were analyzed by repeated measures factorial analyses of variance. The results indicated that administration of diazepam increased the rate of tooth movement at P less than 0.0005 and, interestingly, although diazepam had no effect on undisturbed tissues, it lowered the cAMP levels in the periodontal tissues of orthodontically moved teeth at P less than 0.01. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the concentration of cAMP did not correlate with bone remodeling in this model and perhaps should not be used as an index of periodontal-tissue response during orthodontic tooth movement.", 
    "52": "Aromatic and heterocyclic esters of 1-methyl-4-piperidinol and 1,4-dimethyl-4-piperidinol and aromatic esters of (dialkylamino)alkanols were prepared and evaluated for antiepileptic activity by the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole seizure threshold (scMet) assays and for minimal central neurotoxicity by the rotorod ataxia test. The most potent compound, namely the 2-phenylbenzoate (57) of 3-(diethylamino)propanol, was slightly more potent than diphenylhydantoin in the MES assay, while the 2-phenylbenzoate (24) of 1-methyl-4-piperidinol and the 2-phenylbenzoate (56) of (diethylamino)ethanol displayed activity comparable to that of diphenylhydantoin. The 2-phenethylbenzoate ester (6) of 1-methyl-4-piperidinol exhibited one-third the activity of diphenylhydantoin. The 2,4,5-trimethylbenzoate 40 and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoate 41 of 1-methyl-4-pieridinol were even less potent, but did display activity in the phenobarbital-methsuximide range. Certain compounds interact with sites associated with the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex, but their potencies as anticonvulsant agents do not correlate with interaction at sites on the channel complex. Certain analogues antagonize binding of a batrachotoxin analogue to sodium channel sites, a property indicative of local anesthetic activity. There are structural similarities between 2-phenylbenzoates 57, 56, and 24 and diphenylhydantoin, and the latter anticonvulsant also antagonizes binding of the batrachotoxin analogue.", 
    "53": "A 1,4-benzodiazepine analogue alprazolam (1) undergoes ring-opening hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form a triazolobenzophenone (2). At a neutral pH, 2 rapidly and quantitatively cyclizes back to 1. This facile reversible reaction was utilized in developing water-soluble prodrugs of 1 in which the \"solubility anchoring\" acyl moieties are formyl, acetyl, succinyl, glycyl, leucyl, and gamma-aminobutyryl groups. These compounds were prepared directly from 2 and corresponding acids through DCC coupling in a 1:1 mixture of H2O and THF. They should be stable in aqueous media at room temperature. Promoieties used should be nontoxic at an intended dose level. In vitro human serum hydrolysis study showed that only glycyl and leucyl amides were able to regenerate 1 within a reasonable period of time. Ex vivo competitive receptor binding assay in mice with [3H]flunitrazepam indicated that leucyl amide prodrug should be able to produce a rapid onset of the intrinsic central nervous system activity of 1 when parenterally administered. For all compounds studied, the final outcome of the biological response appears to be kinetically controlled, rather than by an unfavorable equilibrium, particularly by the first step in which the amide bond is hydrolyzed in vivo.", 
    "54": "The use of [3H]flunitrazepam as a ligand to measure alterations in benzodiazepine receptors in vivo in rats was investigated. Animals were injected with [3H]flunitrazepam i.v., arterial samples of [3H]flunitrazepam were obtained and, later, the animals were sacrificed to assay brain binding. [3H]flunitrazepam enters the brain rapidly and binds to benzodiazepine receptors. About two-thirds of this binding is blocked by predosing the animals with 5 mg/kg of clonazepam. The amount of remaining (nonspecific) binding correlates very well (r = 0.88) with the amount of radioactivity found in plasma at the time of death. A series of rats were lesioned unilaterally with kainic acid in the caudate-putamen several months before the infusion of [3H]flunitrazepam. In vivo autoradiography in lesioned rats showed that benzodiazepine binding in globus pallidus and substantia nigra on the side of the lesion was increased significantly as compared to the intact side. The observed changes in benzodiazepine binding were similar to those observed previously in lesioned rats using in vitro techniques. Thus, benzodiazepine receptor regulation can be imaged quantitatively using in vivo binding techniques.", 
    "55": "We evaluated the effect of the two N-trifluoroethyl benzodiazepines, quazepam and its 2-oxo metabolite SCH 15725, which possess preferential affinity for type I benzodiazepine recognition sites, on the binding of [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) to rat brain membrane preparations. The study also included compounds such as diazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (SCH 17514), which have equal affinity for the type I and type II receptor subtypes. Binding of [3H]GABA was studied in frozen-thawed and repeatedly washed cortical membranes incubated in 20 mM KH2PO4 plus 50 mM KCl, pH 7.4, at 4 degrees C in the absence and presence of quazepam or its metabolites. Addition of 10(-6) M quazepam increased by 30% specific [3H]GABA binding; as revealed by Scatchard plot analysis, the effect was due to an increase in the total number of GABA receptors. The effect of quazepam was concentration dependent, and it was shared by its active metabolite SCH 15725. The potency of quazepam and SCH 15725 in enhancing [3H]GABA binding was similar to that of diazepam, whereas CL 218872 and SCH 17514 were less active. Moreover, the [3H]GABA binding-enhancing effect of quazepam was mediated by an occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors, because it was specifically antagonized by 5 X 10(-6) M Ro15-1788.", 
    "56": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDE) has been shown to antagonize the effects of TRH to stimulate the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and elevate cytoplasmic free calcium in rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells. Herein, we show that CDE inhibits TRH stimulation of PRL secretion and that the effect of CDE to antagonize TRH action is caused by its ability to compete with TRH for binding to receptors on GH3 cells. We also use CDE to explore whether continued receptor occupancy is required for prolonged stimulation of cellular responses. CDE had no effect on basal PRL secretion, but caused a dose-dependent inhibition of TRH-induced PRL secretion. CDE decreased the affinity of TRH binding to intact GH3 cells without affecting the maximum binding capacity. As shown previously, CDE had no effect on phosphoinositide metabolism, which was monitored because it appears to be a mechanism for signal transduction by TRH, and when added simultaneously with TRH, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of TRH-induced phosphoinositide metabolism. When CDE was added to cells 2.5 or 5 min after TRH, CDE rapidly terminated the stimulation by TRH of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, shown as inhibition of the continued formation of inositol phosphates and inositol, and of the decrease in phosphoinositides. Lastly, when cells were stimulated with 50 nM TRH, then exposed to 100 microM CDE, and finally to 1000 nM TRH, inositol phosphate formation was stimulated, then inhibited, and then restimulated. These data demonstrate that CDE acts as a competitive antagonist of TRH action on GH3 cells by competing with TRH for binding to its receptor and that continued stimulation by TRH of phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides is tightly coupled to receptor occupancy.", 
    "57": "Sixty patients were randomly allocated in an open study to receive either midazolam or diazepam (Diazemuls) with fentanyl and etomidate for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia during day-stay gynaecological surgery. The excitatory effects of etomidate were controlled by the benzodiazepine-fentanyl combination in both groups. No significant difference in the quality of recovery (as judged by Trieger test analysis), amnesia, incidence of recall of pain on injection of etomidate or nausea and vomiting could be demonstrated between the groups. There was a high degree (97%) of patient acceptance.", 
    "58": "Binding affinities of adinazolam and its metabolite mono-N-demethyladinazolam, U-42352, to the brain tissue are not altered by the presence of proadifen (SKF-525A) in [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FNZ) binding assays in-vitro. Pretreatment of mice with proadifen significantly blocked the ability of intravenously administered adinazolam to inhibit [3H]FNZ binding in the studies ex-vivo. The binding profile of [3H]FNZ to the brain tissue was not significantly different when animals were treated with U-42352 or proadifen with U-42352. These results suggest that proadifen may block the conversion of adinazolam to its active metabolite U-42352.", 
    "59": "Midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam plasma concentrations have been monitored and pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam estimated during anaesthesia induced and maintained by its repeated injection according to two protocols (3 X 0.3 mg kg-1 at 45 min intervals or an induction dose of 0.3 mg kg-1 with maintenance doses of 0.15 mg kg-1 at 30 min intervals). Minimum plasma concentrations of midazolam measured just before each injection were 258.8 +/- 108.4 ng ml-1 for the first protocol and 353.1 +/- 55.2 ng ml-1 for the second protocol; maximum midazolam concentrations, measured 5 min after the last administration, were 1103.1 +/- 237.9 ng ml-1 and 743.0 +/- 103.2 ng ml-1, respectively, suggesting that a continuous infusion of midazolam after a loading dose should be better than repeated injections at keeping the concentration close to the sedative level of 400 ng ml-1. The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those already published, except for the beta elimination half-life of midazolam (3.24 +/- 0.90 h for protocol 1 and 3.34 +/- 1.47 h for protocol 2) which was slightly longer than that reported for single dose studies. The comparison of plasma determinations, obtained either by gas-liquid chromatography or by a radioreceptor assay technique, clearly showed that 1-hydroxymidazolam, even after repeated midazolam administration, was not present at a concentration sufficient to affect the overall pharmacological activity of the parent drug.", 
    "60": "Lormetazepam, a relatively new benzodiazepine was compared in a randomised, double blind trial with diazepam for its effectiveness as an oral premedicant drug. A scoring system was used to assess sedation, relief of anxiety, nausea, dizziness and cardiovascular effects in two groups of patients having orthopaedic operations. Some statistical indication that lormetazepam has a greater anxiolytic effect than diazepam was found, but in assessing total effect using a known scoring system, no difference was demonstrated between the two drugs.", 
    "61": "Buspirone hydrochloride (HCl)1 is a new anxiolytic with a unique chemical structure. Its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Unlike the benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties, and hence has been termed 'anxioselective'. As evidenced by a few double-blind clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety assessed by standard rating scales similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam. Like diazepam, buspirone is effective in patients with mixed anxiety/depression, although the number of patients studied to date is small. In several studies, a 'lagtime' of 1 to 2 weeks to the onset of anxiolytic effect has been noted; hence motivation of patient compliance may be necessary. Sedation occurs much less often after buspirone than after the benzodiazepines; other side effects are minor and infrequent. In healthy volunteers, buspirone does not impair psychomotor or cognitive function, and appears to have no additive effect with alcohol. Early evidence suggests that buspirone has limited potential for abuse and dependence. Thus, although only wider clinical use for longer periods of time will more clearly define some elements of its pharmacological profile, with its low incidence of sedation buspirone is a useful addition to the treatments available for generalised anxiety. It may well become the preferred therapy in patients in whom daytime alertness is particularly important.", 
    "62": "Twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of 3-methoxy,4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MOPEG) and levels of free and conjugated plasma 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG) were measured in 56 depressed patients to find a possible correlation between these two peripheral indices of cerebral noradrenergic activity. Plasma DOPEG was measured at 9:00 AM on the same day that urine was collected for the measurement of MOPEG. All depressed patients were diagnosed as having affective disorders according to DSM-III. No correlation was found between plasma free or conjugated DOPEG levels and urinary MOPEG output. This lack of correlation was found in the total sample of depressed patients (56), in 45 patients diagnosed as having major depressive episodes, and in 24 depressed patients diagnosed as major depressive with melancholia. The authors discuss the significance of this lack of correlation between two peripheral indices of central noradrenergic metabolism.", 
    "63": "This double-blind cross-over study of 14 severely spastic inpatients with chronic multiple sclerosis reveals that once-daily doses of ketazolam, a new drug, are effective in reducing spasticity in a significant proportion of patients without significant side-effects. Added to the similar findings of an earlier double-blind controlled study of divided doses, the results suggest that this special feature of ketazolam provides a unique flexibility that may be exploited in individual cases.", 
    "64": "The effects of a variety of minor tranquilizers and of benzodiazepine inverse agonists on the stress-induced increase in frontal cortical dopamine metabolism have been studied in the rat. Electric footshock stress increased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the frontal (but not parietal) cortex and in the nucleus accumbens but not in the striatum or ventral tegmental area. Similar stress-induced alterations of frontal cortical DOPAC levels were observed after DSP4-induced noradrenergic denervation or after adrenalectomy. Other types of stress, e.g. conditioned fear (exposure to an environment paired previously with footshock) or swim stress also provoked an elevation of DOPAC levels in the prefrontal cortex. When administered systemically, the anxiolytic agents meprobamate, CL 218,872, CGS 9896, suriclone and the hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs zolpidem and zopiclone all prevented the electric footshock stress-induced augmentation of cortical DOPAC levels whereas the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists progabide, muscimol and depamide or the sedative alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin were ineffective. The preventive effect of diazepam and zolpidem on the stress-induced biochemical response was antagonized by the benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 8216 but not by the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist bicuculline. In nonstressed rats, systemic administration of the anxiogenic benzodiazepine inverse agonists beta-CCM (methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) and beta-CCE (ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), but not of the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 or CGS 8216, caused an increase in frontal cortical DOPAC similar to that provoked by stress and which was antagonized by zolpidem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The effects of zopiclone, CL 218,872 and diazepam were compared in squirrel monkeys trained to respond under a fixed-interval (FI) schedule of food presentation. Dose-response curves were determined for each drug by administering cumulative doses i.v. during timeout periods that preceded sequential components of the FI schedule. Low and intermediate doses of zopiclone (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), CL 218,872 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in the rate of FI responding. The highest doses of diazepam (10.0 mg/kg) and CL 218,872 (30.0 mg/kg), but not of zopiclone (30.0 mg/kg), decreased FI responding markedly. Doses of zopiclone, CL 218,872 and diazepam that were effective in increasing FI responding were similar to the doses reported previously to increase suppressed (punished) responding in squirrel monkeys. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 or CGS 8216 (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg) reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced normally by intermediate doses of zopiclone, CL 218,872 or diazepam, suggesting that the rate-increasing effects of the three agonists reflect similar actions at benzodiazepine recognition sites. In contrast, Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 were less effective or ineffective in attenuating the marked decreases in FI responding produced by the highest doses of CL 218,872 or diazepam, suggesting that the rate-decreasing effects of these agonists are mediated differently from their rate-increasing effects.", 
    "66": "Buspirone was compared to alprazolam and lorazepam in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in a 4-week, double-blind study of 60 patients. All three medications were effective and similar in producing significant reductions in anxiety as assessed by standardized anxiety rating scales and by global evaluations of patients by physicians. There were significant differences in drowsiness, lethargy, and/or fatigue: fewer patients in the buspirone group than in the alprazolam group (16% vs. 60%, respectively; p less than .01) or the lorazepam group (16% vs. 65%, respectively; p less than .0003) experienced these undesirable side effects. This demonstration of similar effectiveness and superior safety would favor buspirone in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.", 
    "67": "In the present study Corne's technique that has been commonly used to quantify the gastric mucus in situ using the dye, Alcian blue, has been improved. Furthermore, the effects of antiulcerogenic agents on the decrease in gastric mucus gel during water-immersion stress were also studied. In order to increase the extraction of dye-recovery, we used 30% dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (docusate sodium, DSS) instead of 0.5 mol/l MgCl2 used in Corne's technique. The control values of the dye-recovery extracted with DSS were about 5 times higher than those with MgCl2. Indomethacin (20 mg/kg s.c.) failed to influence dye-recovery with DSS and MgCl2, while reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.) significantly decreased the dye-recovery in both extractions. Water-immersion stress for 2 h decreased the dye-recovery with DSS but the dye-recovery with MgCl2 decreased only 15 min after water-immersion. These results suggest that extraction with DSS reflects the mucus gel secretion, and that dye-recovery with DSS is more sensitive to alteration of mucus gel than that with MgCl2. Bombesin (10 micrograms/kg), secretin (100 U/kg) and mild irritants increased the dye-recovery with DSS. Cimetidine remarkably reduced the mucus secretion and failed to improve the decrease in mucus during water-immersion stress. Pirenzepine and atropine dose-dependently prevented the decrease in the dye-recovery during water-immersion stress.", 
    "68": "Characterization of muscarinic receptor subtypes on rat pancreatic acinar cells was examined by using specific muscarinic receptor antagonists to study amylase secretion and binding of [N-methyl-3H]scopolamine ([3H]NMS). Rat pancreatic acini were dispersed in HEPES-Ringer buffer and incubated with acetylcholine +/- 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperadine-methiodide (4-DAMP, a specific M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist) or +/- pirenzepine (a specific M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist). 4-DAMP (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) caused a progressive parallel rightward shift in the acetylcholine dose-response curve without a change in maximal amylase release. Only high concentrations of pirenzepine (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) caused a rightward shift in the dose-response curve to acetylcholine. Schild analysis of the data indicated an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 200 pM for 4-DAMP and 183 nM for pirenzepine. The slope of the Schild regression lines was not different from unity, suggesting competitive inhibition. Binding of 50 pM [3H]NMS was specific, rapid, and saturable. [3H]NMS binding was displaced by increasing concentrations of 4-DAMP or pirenzepine with apparent Ki's of 102 pM and 330 nM, respectively, and similar maximal binding levels of 60 fmol/mg prot. We have demonstrated that 4-DAMP has an approximately 1,000-fold greater potency than pirenzepine to inhibit amylase release and binding, indicating that cholinergic-stimulated amylase release from pancreatic acini is mediated by M2 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "69": "In this study the binding to 'central' and 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptors in various brain areas in MR/N and MNR/N rat strains was investigated. The specific ligands [3H]BCCE and [3H]RO 5-4864 were used for binding to 'central' and 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptors, respectively. Neither [3H]BCCE nor [3H]RO 5-4864 binding was changed in MNR/N strain in comparison to MR/N rat strain in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and medulla-pons. Scatchard analysis of [3H]BCCE or [3H]RO 5-4864 binding to cerebellar membranes also revealed no changes in either affinity or density in both types of benzodiazepine receptors. Autoradiographic analysis of brain regions using microdensitometry shows no differences in [3H]flunitrazepam binding between the MR/N and MNR/N strains. Our results, therefore, fail to confirm a previous report showing alterations in benzodiazepine receptors in Maudsley rats.", 
    "70": "Following unilateral damage to the anterior-medial region of the neocortex (AMC) in rats a sensory asymmetry appeared, but recovered within a week. In a separate group of rats with AMC lesions daily 3-week exposure to diazepam (Valium, 5 mg/kg) beginning 12 h after surgery caused recovery to be delayed indefinitely. The efficiency and speed (as opposed to symmetry) of behavior was not impaired. More than 9 weeks after discontinuation of diazepam (12 weeks postsurgery), recovery was still not apparent. Postmortem analysis ruled out lesion size as a contributing factor. In a second experiment undrugged animals with AMC lesions were allowed to recover for at least 3 weeks before being exposed to diazepam. These animals showed only a transient (2-day) reinstatement of asymmetry despite continuous drug treatment. We conclude that important mechanisms serving recovery of function may be vulnerable during a short period soon after brain damage.", 
    "71": "The high-affinity muscarinic antagonist /3H/-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (/3H/-QNB) has been used to label muscarinic receptors in a crude membrane fraction of rat cerebral cortex, colon and heart. The inhibition of /3H/-QNB binding by Atropine, Oxotremorine and Pirenzepine was investigated at three temperatures: 37 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 10 degrees C. The IC50 values and the proportion of high (Rt1) and low (Rt2) affinity binding sites were determined for the three compounds. When the temperature were lowered from 37 degrees C to 10 degrees C, in the agonist and antagonist dissociation constants decreased in all tissues. Changes in temperature did not modify Rt1 or Rt2 values for Oxotremorine and Pirenzepine. The results show marked temperature-dependent modifications of IC50 values for muscarinic receptors of high- and low-affinity sites in rat cerebral cortex, colon or heart.", 
    "72": "In a partially depolarized guinea pig papillary muscle preparation, BAY K8644 stimulated voltage-operated calcium channels, promoting slow action potentials; this effect was dose-dependent over a concentration range of 3 X 10(-7) M to 3 X 10(-6) M. Isoproterenol and histamine also induced slow action potentials by stimulating beta or H2 receptors, respectively. PK 11195, the antagonist of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, inhibited the effect of BAY K8644, but not those of histamine or isoproterenol. Moreover, PK 11195 \"dose-dependently\" antagonized the ability of RO5-4864 to inhibit the slow action potentials elicited by barium chloride. Thus, in the heart, PK 11195, an antagonist of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, can modulate voltage-operated calcium channels when they are activated directly, but not when they are activated by stimulation of neurotransmitter receptors."
