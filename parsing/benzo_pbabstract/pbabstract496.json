    "0": "1. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors on the somatic muscle cells of Ascaris, which mediate muscle cell hyperpolarization and relaxation, have been characterized by use of intracellular recording techniques. 2. These receptors are like mammalian GABAA-receptors in that the response is mediated by an increase conductance to chloride ions. The GABAA-mimetic, muscimol, has a relative potency of 0.40 +/- 0.02 (n = 3) compared to GABA. 3. The stereoselectivity of the GABA receptor on Ascaris is identical to that for the mammalian GABAA-receptor, as determined from the relative potency of three pairs of enantiomers of structural analogues of GABA. 4. The most potent agonist is (S)-(+)-dihydromuscimol which is 7.53 +/- 0.98 (n = 5) times more potent than GABA. 5. The Ascaris GABA receptor is not significantly blocked, at concentrations below 100 microM by the potent, competitive GABAA-receptor antagonist, SR95531. 6. The Ascaris GABA receptor does not recognise agents that are known to block the GABA gated chloride channel in mammalian preparations such as t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS, 10 microM, n = 2) or the insecticide dieldrin (100 microM, n = 3). 7. GABAergic responses in Ascaris are not potentiated by pentobarbitone (100 microM, n = 3) or flurazepam (100 microM, n = 3). 8. The potencies of various GABA-mimetics in the Ascaris preparation have been compared with their potency at displacing GABAA-receptor binding in mammalian brain. Excluding the sulphonic acid derivatives of GABA, the correlation coefficient (r) between the potencies of compounds in the two systems is 0.74 (P less than 0.01). The significance of this correlation is discussed. 9. The pharmacology of the Ascaris GABA receptor is discussed in relation to other invertebrate systems and the mammalian subclassification of GABA receptors.", 
    "1": "Chronic benzodiazepine administration has been reported to decrease gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor function in animals and may alter benzodiazepine binding in neuronal cultures. To assess GABAA receptor function in neuronal cultures exposed to chronic clonazepam, we measured muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake in chick cerebral cortical cultures treated acutely and for 2, 4, and 10 days. Acute clonazepam administration (1 microM) led to an increase in GABA-related chloride uptake at lower doses of muscimol. After chronic clonazepam (1 microM), maximal uptake was markedly decreased at day 10, but maximal uptake was unchanged after 2- and 4-day treatments. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was decreased by approximately 60% after 10 days due to a decrease in receptor number. Decreases in chloride uptake were also observed after 10 days of treatment with 0.1 and 10 microM clonazepam. Concomitant treatment with 0.1 microM Ro15-1788 abrogated the effect of 0.1 microM clonazepam on chloride uptake. Chronic clonazepam treatment (1 microM) did not alter total cellular protein, cellular protein synthesis or degradation or percentage of neuronal cells, as determined morphologically and by [3H]ouabain binding.", 
    "2": "Chronic administration of l-atropine to rats caused a dose-dependent increase (30%) in the density of muscarinic receptors, as measured with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB], in cortex (CTX), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and heart but not the corpus striatum. Serum concentrations of l-atropine reached 80 to 160 nM within 6 hr, whereas densities of binding sites for [3H]QNB did not show a significant increase until after the second day of infusion and receptor densities did not reach new steady state levels until after the fourth day of infusion. The density of binding sites for the M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) was also measured. As noted previously, the density of binding sites for [3H]PZ (defined as M1) was lower than the density of binding sites for [3H]QNB (defined as M1 plus M2). When the densities of binding sites for [3H]QNB and [3H]PZ in CTX plus DH were determined after 14 days of treatment, [3H]QNB binding sites showed a 28% increase, whereas [3H]PZ binding sites did not show any increase. The difference between the densities of binding sites for [3H]QNB and [3H]PZ, an estimate of the density of M2 sites, doubled. The density of binding sites for [3H]QNB appeared to be stable for at least 64 hr after the withdrawal of the drug. The increase in the density of binding sites for [3H]QNB was not reflected in the binding of [3H]oxotremorine-M ([3H]OXO-M), a muscarinic agonist, which was unchanged by l-atropine administration. Because the binding of [3H]OXO-M is sensitive to GTP, this observation suggests that the \"induced\" receptors may not be coupled to a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. In spite of the fact that there was a doubling of the density of M2 sites, no significant differences in dose-response curves for carbachol-induced inhibition of [3H]cAMP accumulation were observed in slices of CTX plus DH from control and l-atropine-treated rats. Similarity, acetylcholine-stimulated accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates in slices of CTX plus DH showed no significant differences between the tissues from control and treated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Urethane-anesthetized rats with perforant pathway stimulating electrodes and recording electrodes placed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were exposed to increasing doses of either the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam or an antagonist (PK-11195, CGS-8216, and RO15-1788). Analysis of the monosynaptic evoked field potentials indicated that none of the four compounds altered the threshold for eliciting the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Reductions in field population spike (PS) amplitudes were seen after exposure to RO15-1788, CGS-8216, and diazepam, but not PK-11195. Using a paired-pulse paradigm, diazepam significantly increased early gamma-aminobutyric acid (GA-BAA)-mediated recurrent inhibition. The antagonist RO15-1788, but not CGS-8216 or PK-11195, also significantly increased early GABAA-mediated inhibition. The increase in GABAA-mediated inhibition after diazepam was reversed by the subsequent administration of the central antagonists RO15-1788 or CGS-8216, but not the peripheral antagonist PK-11195. Pretreatment with CGS-8216 or RO15-1788 prevented diazepam-induced inhibition. These data support the important modulatory role of the central benzodiazepine receptor in early GABAA-mediated inhibition at this synapse. They also suggest that basal granule cell excitability is not importantly modulated by this benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "4": "To investigate the effect of endogenous proteolysis on the molecular weights of the benzodiazepine binding proteins, brains of trout, chicken, and rat were removed immediately after death and stored at room temperature for various periods of time before they were frozen. Photoaffinity labeling of membranes with [3H]flunitrazepam, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, revealed proteolytic fragments of 47K in trout, chicken, and rat. The proteolysis set in rapidly after death. Seemingly in parallel with the degradation observed fluorographically, the affinity for [3H]flunitrazepam increased without systematic changes in receptor density. The degradation pattern was not identical to that of the photolabeled trypsinized benzodiazepine binding proteins. The endogenous proteolytic fragments were deglycosylated in two steps. In conclusion, proteolytic effects must be taken into account when interpreting labeling patterns and binding parameters.", 
    "5": "Although sufentanil in high doses may result in deep coma sufficient to conduct coronary-bypass surgery painlessly in patients, its side effects, e.g., bradycardia and hypotension, may lead to complications in some patients. Since ketamine causes central sympathetic stimulation, we attempted to counteract the vagomimetic effects of sufentanil by ketamine. Anaesthesia was induced in patients, (n = 15), for elective coronary artery-bypass surgery with 0.12 mg.kg-1 midazolam IV, followed by 1 mg.kg-1 ketamine and 0.6 micrograms.kg-1 sufentanil IV eight minutes later. Subsequently, pancuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Three minutes later, the trachea was intubated, and ketamine 1 mg.kg-1.hr-1 IV infusion was started. Incremental doses of 0.6 micrograms.kg-1 sufentanil were given whenever a greater than 15 per cent increase in rate-pressure product was observed. The mean +/- S.E.M. dose of sufentanil before cardiopulmonary bypass was 6.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms.kg and 9.1 +/- 0.9 micrograms.kg for the entire procedure. Although midazolam alone caused reductions in systolic BP, SVR and LVSWI, other haemodynamic variables were not altered. The administration of this anaesthetic technique caused no clinically important adverse haemodynamic changes and/or ST-segment changes and prevented the adverse haemodynamic changes caused by intubation, skin incision, sternotomy and periaortic dissection. Adequate analgesia, complete amnesia and early recovery of wakefulness were observed.", 
    "6": "This paper reports the results of a double-blind comparison of fixed daily doses of 6 mg of alprazolam, 2 mg of alprazolam, 225 mg of imipramine, and placebo for 8 weeks in 81 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Final scores on eight clinical measures were analyzed from all patients who entered the study and from the subset who completed at least 4 weeks of treatment. Eighty-six percent of the high-dose alprazolam patients completed the study. Only 50% of the imipramine patients completed 8 weeks of treatment, apparently because of activation early in treatment and slow onset of therapeutic effects. This study confirmed the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of alprazolam, especially at the higher dose, in panic disorder. It also confirmed the therapeutic effectiveness of imipramine among patients who tolerated the drug. It suggested the usefulness of a flexible, individual approach to dose escalation with imipramine. Methodologically the study underscored the importance of using multiple approaches to the analysis of clinical data from therapeutic trials of psychotropic agents with complex effects that may contribute to patients' premature termination.", 
    "7": "The cardiac and hemodynamic effects of bupivacaine, diazepam and their coadministration were evaluated in six mongrel dogs chronically instrumented for recording of mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular (LV) pressure, and cardiac output (CO, electromagnetic flow probe around the ascending aorta). LVdP/dt was derived from the LV pressure signal, and its positive peak was used as an index of myocardial contractility. Heart rate (HR), RR, PR and QT intervals were measured from ECG. At weekly intervals, each dog received in a random order one of the following treatments: (1) saline as control, (2) diazepam (0.2 mg/kg, intravenous, bolus), (3) bupivacaine (0.4 mg/kg intravenous bolus, followed by 15 micrograms/kg/minute, during 30 minutes), and (4) a combination of diazepam and bupivacaine, as in (2) and (3), respectively. Despite its intrinsic cardiodepressant effects, bupivacaine induced a delayed (30-minute) compensatory increase in HR (+ 11%, p less than 0.05) and LVdP/dt (+ 10%, p less than 0.05). Diazepam decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR; -16%, p less than 0.05) with concomitant increases in HR and CO. After diazepam pretreatment, LVdP/dt did not rise after bupivacaine administration, whereas SVR decreased (-14%, p less than 0.05) and HR increased (+19%, p less than 0.05). The QT-RR relationship remained unchanged regardless of the treatment administered. Thus, diazepam might blunt the compensatory effects of bupivacaine on cardiac function and may decrease the margin of safety of this local anesthetic agent during major neural blockade procedure.", 
    "8": "The present study was designed to elucidate the brain site of the anticonflict action of zopiclone (ZOP), a cyclopyrrolone derivative, using the rat conflict procedure. ZOP at 10 micrograms/microliters, bilaterally injected into the mammillary body (MB), produced a significant increase in the punished responses, with no change in the unpunished responses. There were no significant changes in these responses when ZOP was injected into the central amygdala, frontal cortex or dorsal hippocampus. Attention should be given to the possibility that the MB is the site of the anticonflict action of ZOP.", 
    "9": "A sensitive (2 ng/mL) and specific method for the determination of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 or flumazenil is described. Following a simple extraction, the compound is analyzed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and detection at 245 nm. The method was applied to plasma specimens collected from patients receiving a single dose of this drug.", 
    "10": "Twenty-six healthy male volunteers received a single 10 mg dose of diazepam on two occasions in a crossover bioequivalence study comparing the reference product (Valium) and a generic formulation (NeoCalme). Concentrations of diazepam and its metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, were determined during 264h after each dose. Peak plasma diazepam concentrations were significantly lower for NeoCalme vs Valium (247 vs 394 ng ml-1, p less than 0.001) and reached significantly later after the dose (1.62 vs 0.98 h, p less than 0.001). Total area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) was also significantly lower for NeoCalme (6614 vs 7552 ng ml-1 x h, p less than 0.001), although AUC ratios for NeoCalme divided by Valium satisfied the '75-75' guidelines. Findings for desmethyldiazepam were similar. Thus, diazepam absorption from the generic brand of diazepam is significantly slower than from Valium, which in turn could lead to therapeutic inequivalence.", 
    "11": "Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery, anaesthetized with diazepam, alfentanil and nitrous oxide in oxygen, and paralysed with atracurium were given flumazenil or placebo i.v. in a double-blind randomized study to assess the efficacy of flumazenil. Awake state, heart rate, arterial pressure, rate of ventilation and arterial blood-gas values were measured at 0, 5, 30, 120 and 240 min after administration of flumazenil or placebo. Flumazenil was found to antagonize the sedative effects of diazepam; there was no resedation within the time of observation. There were no intergroup differences in any of the other measured variables. A median dose of diazepam 0.33 mg kg-1 during surgery lasting a median of 98 min was antagonized by a median dose of flumazenil 0.35 mg. No side effects related to flumazenil were observed.", 
    "12": "Healthy male volunteers (n = 48) aged 18-44 years received a single 10-mg oral dose of diazepam. Plasma diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations were measured at multiple points during the next 11 days. The distribution of peak plasma concentration (mean, 406 ng/ml) was not skewed and did not differ significantly from normal (Guassian). However, the distributions of elimination half-life (44.2 h), elimination rate constant (0.0219/h), clearance (26.6 ml/min), and volume of distribution (83 L) all were significantly skewed and deviated significantly fron normal. After logarithmic transformation, the distributions of elimination rate constant, elimination half-life, and volume of distribution were consistent with normal; however, this was not the case for time of peak plasma concentration. Thus, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of oral diazepam are highly variable even in a relatively homogeneous population. Parametric statistical testing procedures and pharmacokinetic forecasting schemes may be improved by more precise delineation of the underlying distributions for pharmacokinetic variables.", 
    "13": "Absence epilepsy with multiple daily seizures and onset at the age of 6 and 1/2 months in a healthy female child with normal development is described. EEG-video recording revealed typical absence seizures (vacant staring and interruption of motor activity) and complex absences (as above, plus raising of the eyeballs, slight beatings of the eyebrows, and forward propulsion of head and shoulders). The absences were accompanied by bilateral symmetrical 3-Hz spike-wave discharges preceded, and at times followed, by bilateral frontoparietal theta activity coinciding with onset and termination of the absence seizures. The seizures regressed with nitrazepam therapy. At age 3-years, the child is seizure-free and shows normal neurologic development.", 
    "14": "Thirteen patients requiring infrarenal aortic clamping were studied during flunitrazepam, fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Each awake patient was submitted to a volume loading test to determine the haemodynamic status and his optimal left pre-load. Anesthetic induction was well tolerated. Nitroglycerin was administered by continuous infusion before aortic clamping and we determined the dose necessary to decrease the systemic vascular resistance by 20 per cent. This dose was very variable and needed to be increased in five of 13 patients at the time of clamping. With nitroglycerin, we noticed no significant alteration of MVO2 at clamping. Volume loading allowed good stability at declamping.", 
    "15": "Basal, preoperative and postoperative perception thresholds and pain tolerance thresholds were studied in 32 patients undergoing minor oral surgery using monopolar stimulation of a vital anterior tooth. Significant differences were found between the perception and pain tolerance thresholds, the basal and preoperative perception and pain tolerance thresholds being higher than the postoperative thresholds. Decreased postoperative pain tolerance thresholds were found in patients with increased anxiety. The effect of premedication on the thresholds was also studied. Premedication with diazepam and pethidine caused an increase in the preoperative perception and pain tolerance thresholds but did not prevent a decrease in the postoperative perception and pain tolerance thresholds. The increase in the preoperative perception and pain tolerance thresholds caused by the premedication was equal in magnitude to the decrease in the thresholds measured immediately after surgery.", 
    "16": "Water intoxication mostly occurs in psychiatric patients. We observed 13 episodes of severe hyponatremia (less than 120 mmol/l) following a period of increased water consumption in 10 psychiatric patients (5 men, 5 women, mean age 48.8 years) treated with neuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines. Other causes of hyponatremia were excluded. The initial clinical signs were associated with severe gastrointestinal and neurological disorders requiring intensive care. In every case a gradual return to normal of natremia was obtained by creating a negative water balance while compensating for the sodium loss. From a study of urine and plasma osmolality ratio (U/P osm) on admission, several physiopathological mechanisms could be envisaged. A U/P osm ratio lower than 1 (6 cases) suggested a water intake exceeding the maximum dilution capacity of the kidneys (20-25 1), or a lesser water intake with little or no osmolal intake, or again an intrarenal disorder of urine dilution. When the U/P osm ratio was higher than 1 (7 cases), reflecting inappropriate secretion of the antidiuretic hormone, the hyponatremia could be explained by the psychosis itself, the treatment taken by the patients, a disorder of thirst regulation and/or a non-osmotic stimulation of vasopressin. This population, therefore, was heterogeneous: the mechanisms which contribute to this pathology are not fully elucidated, and they probably involve several factors.", 
    "17": "Immunocytochemical methods, both light and electron microscopic, were used to identify the cellular and subcellular locations of octadecaneuropeptide-like immunoreactivity (ODN-LI) in rat brains serially sectioned in total. ODN-LI includes a newly discovered family of rat brain neuropeptides that are processing products of a common endogenous neuropeptide precursor, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI). The members of this neuropeptide family have been shown to displace benzodiazepines and beta carbolines from their specific recognition sites located on the allosteric modulatory centers of GABAA receptors. We have previously examined the distribution of DBI-LI in rat brain. The anti-ODN antiserum used in this study does not cross-react with rat DBI, and thus allows a distinct analysis of ODN-LI as opposed to DBI-LI, in rat brain. Neuronal perikarya with ODN-LI were located in many brain nuclei, such as the pontine n., reticular thalamic n., subgeniculate n., supraoptic n. and suprachiasmatic n., and also in brain areas such as cerebral and cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, inferior colliculus, olfactory bulb and subiculum. In addition to perikaryal labelling, a punctate or diffuse immunostaining with ODN antibodies was detected in many brain regions such as cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdaloid area, olfactory tubercle, some of the deep cerebellar nuclei and some circumventricular organs. At the electron microscopic level ODN-LI was identified in neuronal perikarya, processes and terminals. In the axon terminals, ODN-LI appears to be associated with synaptic vesicles. Whenever ODN-LI was detected within neurons, DBI-LI was also found in identical cells. In addition to neurons, DBI-LI was found in glia or glial-like cells, while ODN-LI was not found in these cells. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ODN may be a neuron-specific processing product of DBI and that ODN-like peptides may act as putative endogenous allosteric modulators of various GABAA receptor subtypes.", 
    "18": "Autoradiography revealed very low density of muscarinic receptors in the rat pineal gland. Yet, the magnitude of phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited with 0.1 mM carbachol was similar to that seen with 1 mM norepinephrine. The cholinergic and adrenergic phosphoinositide responses were fully additive. The cholinergic signal was insensitive to pertussis toxin both in vivo and in vitro and persisted in pineals cultured for 5 days. The data expand our previous finding on functional muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the rat pineal gland.", 
    "19": "In rats, the degeneration of the striato-nigral GABAergic pathway caused by the intrastriatal injection of kainic acid induced a marked decrease (65%) of GABA content and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity and a dramatic increase (225%) in the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) to a membrane preparation from the substantia nigra homolateral to the injected striatum. The increase in [35S]TBPS binding in the denervated substantia nigra was exclusively due to an increased density of binding sites (Bmax) with no change in the dissociation constant (kd). The enhancement in [35S]TBPS binding was almost completely reversed by the intraperitoneal administration of diazepam (3 mg/kg) to kainic acid-lesioned rats. Moreover, diazepam produced a significant decrease (30%) in the density of [35S]TBPS binding sites also in the sham-operated side. In contrast the 'in vitro' addition of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 microM) to the membrane preparation from the denervated substantia nigra further increased [35S]TBPS binding. These findings suggest the view that the increase of nigral [35S]TBPS binding is directly related to the inhibition in the function of nigral GABAergic synapses following the loss of the striato-nigral GABAergic pathway. Our results indicate that [35S]TBPS binding to brain structure is a potential tool to reveal alteration in the function of GABAA receptor complex elicited by physiological, pharmacological and pathological conditions.", 
    "20": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone that has a variety of physiologically important functions in the gastrointestinal tract, in which distinct high affinity receptors have been identified. We describe here the purification of the digitonin-solubilized rat pancreatic receptor as an initial step in the determination of its primary structure. Solubilization of total pancreatic membranes using 1% digitonin resulted in a single class of binding sites with a specific content of 4 pmol/mg as measured in a soluble binding assay using the nonpeptidyl CCK antagonist [3H]3S[-]-N-[2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-yl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide [( 3H]364,718). The solubilized receptor was purified using the following chromatographic steps: 1) cation exchange; 2) Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I-agarose; and 3) Sephacryl S-300. The final preparation of the purified receptor had a specific content of 8,055 pmol/mg, which represented a 9,051-fold purification from intact membranes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified receptor preparation under reducing conditions resulted in a predominant polypeptide with an Mr = 85,000-95,000 and minor polypeptides of Mr = 57,000 and 26,000 as determined by radiolabeling and silver staining. Solubilized pancreatic membranes were affinity labeled with the peptidyl CCK agonist 125I-D-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31,6-NO2-Phe33)CCK-26-33] and chromatographed under conditions similar to those described for untreated membranes. Elution of radioactive peaks from each chromatographic column was coincident with [3H]364,718 binding activity and resulted in a labeled polypeptide having the same electrophoretic mobility as receptor derived from freshly labeled membranes and purified from untreated membranes. High performance liquid-gel exclusion chromatography of the crude digitonin-solubilized membrane preparation revealed an estimated molecular size for the [3H]364,718-binding activity of 370,000, which was consistent with the size determined by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of the purified receptor complexed with the labeled nonpeptidyl antagonist. Binding of [3H]364,718 to the purified receptor preparation was comparable to that observed with the crude solubilized pancreatic membrane preparation; and both the homologous ligand 364,718 (Ki = 0.5 nm) and CCK-8 (Ki = 1.4 microM) competed for binding to both preparations in a similar manner.", 
    "21": "Quantitative autoradiographic analysis revealed changes in [3H]flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine agonist) binding in the anterior hypothalamus nucleus, the medial preoptic area and the cortico-medial amygdala nucleus following in vivo estradiol. The administration of 4 mg of progesterone, but not 1 mg, increased the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus and in the oriens-pyramidalis CA1 layer of the hippocampus. Exposure of brain sections in vitro to the potent, naturally occurring progesterone metabolite, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, induced GABA-dependent changes in flunitrazepam binding, similar to the changes induced by progesterone, thus suggesting that different steroid mechanisms are implicated in the control of flunitrazepam binding.", 
    "22": "We used an in vitro radioligand receptor binding assay with rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum membrane preparations to show that 1-[3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenoxy)propyl]-4-phenyl piperazine (BP-554) had much higher affinity for 5-HT1A recognition sites than for 5-HT1-non-A, 5-HT2, benzodiazepine, dopamine D-2 and alpha 2-adrenergic recognition sites. The compound inhibited the activity of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat hippocampal membranes. Intraperitoneal injection of BP-554 to mice decreased the concentration of only 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid of the amines and their metabolites in the brain and decreased the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan in the brain after decarboxylase inhibition by 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine. Furthermore, the administration of BP-554 caused hypothermia and increased serum corticosterone levels in mice. The observed effects of BP-554 were similar to those of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. These results suggest that BP-554 acts as a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist in vivo.", 
    "23": "Significant neurochemical, immunocytochemical, and ligand binding studies support a role for GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the inferior colliculus (IC). The present study attempted to satisfy some of the remaining criteria for establishing transmitter identity by utilizing iontophoretic application onto IC neurons of agents affecting the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The agents examined include GABA, a GABAB agonist (baclofen), a GABAA antagonist (bicuculline), a GABA uptake inhibitor (nipecotic acid), and a benzodiazepine (flurazepam), thought to exert its actions on the GABA receptor complex. Application of GABA results in inhibition of the spontaneous firing and acoustically evoked responses of inferior colliculus neurons. The inhibitory effect of GABA is enhanced by the simultaneous application of nipecotic acid or flurazepam. These agents as well as baclofen produce firing reductions when applied alone in higher doses. The effect of GABA can be blocked by application of bicuculline, and acoustically evoked (binaural) inhibition can also be selectively blocked by low doses of this GABAA antagonist. These data along with previous studies utilizing different techniques fulfill many of the criteria for establishment of GABA as an important inhibitory transmitter in the inferior colliculus.", 
    "24": "The effects of two benzodiazepines, diazepam and clonazepam, were studied on the release of [3H]noradrenaline and of [3H]acetylcholine elicited by preganglionic stimulation of the cat isolated superior cervical ganglion and on the contractile responses evoked by either nerve stimulation or exogenous noradrenaline in the cat isolated nictitating membrane. Both 10 microM diazepam and 10 microM clonazepam reduced by approximately 50% the release of [3H]noradrenaline and of [3H]acetylcholine in the cat ganglion whereas they did not modify the contractile responses in the nictitating membrane. It is concluded that benzodiazepines are also peripheral neuroactive agents and that they exhibit a tissue-selective action within the same animal species.", 
    "25": "Putative M1 (high-affinity pirenzepine) muscarinic receptors in rabbit hippocampal membranes, treated with 0.1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), were selectively labeled with [3H]pirenzepine. A single class of binding sites was labeled with a Kd of 3.4 nM, consistent with the pharmacologically-defined M1 subtype of muscarinic receptors. While full muscarinic agonists bound to high- and low-affinity states of [3H]pirenzepine-labeled M1 sites with a KL/KH ratio of approximately 100, the ratio for partial muscarinic agonists was approximately 10. The high-affinity binding of all agonists tested required divalent cations, and was interconverted to low-affinity binding in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp). Direct labeling of the high-affinity agonist state of M1 receptors was achieved with 5 nM [3H]oxotremorine-M by selectively uncoupling the high-affinity agonist state of M2 (low-affinity pirenzepine) receptors with NEM. The rate of dissociation of [3H]Pxotremorine-M from M1 receptors was accelerated 6-fold by GppNHp. These results provide further evidence which suggests that putative M1 muscarinic receptors activate second messenger systems by coupling to NEM-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.", 
    "26": "Five different muscarinic receptor subtypes can be distinguished by the differences in their amino acid sequence, the coupled signal transduction system, pharmacological binding properties and activation of ionic fluxes. The present study served to characterize the binding profile of muscarinic receptors in human colon carcinoma cells (HT-29) using selective muscarinic antagonists. The affinities of the compounds were compared with their potency to inhibit cholinergically-activated phosphoinositide metabolism. Pirenzepine displaced [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine binding and inhibited inositolphosphate (IP) release with potencies typical of those of non-M1 receptors. The M3 subtype-selective antagonists sila-hexocyclium and hexahydro-sila-difenidol had high affinity to the muscarinic receptors in HT-29 cells (KD = 3.1 nM and 27 nM, respectively) and inhibited IP release at nanomolar concentrations. The M2 receptor antagonists, AF-DX 116 and methoctramine, had low antimuscarinic potencies. Our results demonstrate that HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells contain an apparently pure population of M3 receptors. These cells could serve as a model system for further investigations concerning regulatory and signal transduction mechanisms associated with glandular muscarinic M3 receptors.", 
    "27": "In the fetal and young primate neostriatum, cholinergic and dopaminergic markers show patches of high density surrounded by a lower-density matrix. In the adult, the same markers display the opposite pattern, a lower density in striosomes, surrounded by a higher-density matrix. In order to understand the developmental sequences leading to the adult compartmental organization of the primate neostriatum, a quantitative technique was used to study the ontogeny of pre- and postsynaptic components of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons in baboon caudate nucleus and putamen. The development of specific uptake mechanisms for choline and dopamine and receptors was studied by means of quantitative autoradiography of the specific binding of [3H]-hemicholinium-3 [( 3H]-HC3) and [3H]-mazindol [( 3H]-MAZ) to the choline and dopamine uptake systems, respectively. [3H]-pirenzepine [( 3H]-PIR) was used to label M1 muscarinic receptors and [3H]-spiroperidol [( 3H]-SPI) was used to label striatal dopamine D2 receptors. Serial sections were used for each ligand to determine the precise anatomical relationships between the binding patterns of the different markers. Our aim was to determine whether the adult striosomal distribution of the binding sites studied was due to 1) a selective decrease in patch/striosomal binding density or 2) a selective increase in matrix binding density. Our studies show that a postnatal decrease in the density of [3H]-HC3 sites in the patch/striosomes and an increase in the matrix density of [3H]-MAZ sites are the primary, but not the sole, changes in the compartmental distribution of these sites leading to the adult striosomal organization of the striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation. D2 receptors follow the general developmental pattern of [3H]-MAZ and [3H]-HC3, changing their density of distribution in both compartments during the developmental period examined. In addition, M1 muscarinic receptors already display their adult pattern in the newborn baboon striatum, and therefore represent one of the first neurochemical makers to adopt its mature organization.", 
    "28": "Lorazepam, oxazepam, and methylprednisolone were compared for antiemetic efficacy in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. Three consecutive courses of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy were administered at equal doses so that each patient acted as his own control. Of 100 patients randomized, 85 received at least two of the three agents and were evaluable for analysis. Lorazepam significantly reduced the number of patients with more than ten vomits compared to either oxazepam (P less than 0.05) or methylprednisolone (P less than 0.001). Lorazepam also significantly reduced the number of patients with the most severe degrees of vomiting compared to either oxazepam or methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.005). The duration of vomiting was reduced significantly after the first 48 hours postchemotherapy for those patients receiving lorazepam over those receiving methylprednisolone (P less than 0.05). Lorazepam significantly reduced the number of patients with severe nausea compared to both oxazepam and methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.05), but there were no significant differences in duration of nausea among the groups. The results of linear analogue self-assessment scores indicated a strong patient preference for lorazepam over both oxazepam and methylprednisolone. Drowsiness was significantly more common with both lorazepam and oxazepam compared to methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001). Patients who received lorazepam or oxazepam also experienced significantly more severe drowsiness than those patients receiving methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001). Lack of recall was significantly more common with lorazepam than with oxazepam and methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001) and was more profound when lorazepam was compared with oxazepam (P less than 0.05) and with methylprednisolone (P less than 0.001). Methylprednisolone was administered with minimal side effects. The results of this randomized cross-over study indicate that, in the dosage/schedule used, lorazepam is a significantly superior premedicant than is either oxazepam or methylprednisolone in alleviating the distress of cytotoxic-induced emesis in patients receiving cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.", 
    "29": "Chronic phenobarbital administration for 20 days to mice resulted in significant increases in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in the heart, kidney and cerebellum, but did not affect the density of these sites in the olfactory bulb. No alteration in the affinity (KD) of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites for their ligand [3H]PK 11195 was observed in any of the organs examined. Phenobarbital treatment did not affect the maximal binding capacity or the affinity of the central benzodiazepine receptors for [3H]flunitrazepam in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. A significant reduction in [3H]muscimol binding in the hippocampus was obtained following chronic phenobarbital treatment. Such an alteration was not detected in the cerebral cortex. The KD values remained unaltered in both tissues. The modulatory effect of phenobarbital on peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites could be related to alterations in the functions of these organs or to the neurochemical effects of the drug.", 
    "30": "The interaction between GABAA receptors and benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site subtypes in the spinal cord of the rat was investigated. Computer analysis of displacement curves for [3H]flunitrazepam [( 3H]FNT) binding by 2-oxo-quazepam (2OXOQ) indicated the presence of two subtypes of BZD recognition sites in this region. Type I sites accounted for approximately 25% of the total number of BZD recognition sites, the remainder being Type II sites. A similar proportion of Type I and Type II sites was obtained by Scatchard analysis of the saturation curves for [3H]FNT, [3H]2OXOQ and [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate [( 3H]beta CCE) binding. The in vitro addition of GABA (10(-8)-10(-4) M) to spinal cord membrane preparations produced an increase in the binding of [3H]FNT and [3H]2OXOQ. The maximal enhancement produced by GABA was 50 and 82% above control values for [3H]FNT and [3H]2OXOQ, respectively. In contrast, GABA stimulated both [3H]FNT and [3H]2OXOQ binding in the cerebellum to a similar extent. We also evaluated the effects of different ligands for BZD recognition sites on the binding of [3H]GABA to spinal cord membranes, as compared with brain areas containing a higher proportion ( greater than 30%) of Type I sites. Diazepam, quazepam and the beta-carboline, ZK 93423, enhanced the specific binding of [3H]GABA in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-7)-10(-5) M) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus but not in the spinal cord and cerebellum. These results indicate that there is a regional variation in the interaction between GABA and BZD recognition sites in the central nervous system.", 
    "31": "Midazolam 15 mg orally, was compared with the combination of pentobarbital, promethazine, opial and scopolamine as premedication for ear surgery under local anaesthesia in the first of a series of three double blind clinical trials. Sedation, pain sensation and appreciation by patient and surgeon alike were in favour of the pentobarbital regime. Anxiolysis was the same for both regimes. The number of actions needed to administer the medication was basically lower for midazolam. Comparing in a similar, second study midazolam 15 mg with higher doses of 20 mg and 25 mg, the results were satisfactory with the highest dose. Pain during the administration of the local anaesthesia was felt in 16% of the patients. Adding 10 mg morphine intramuscularly in a third study did not prove to diminish the percentage of patients with pain complaints. It is concluded that 25 mg midazolam taken orally 45 minutes pre-operatively is a satisfactory premedication for ear surgery and less troublesome than the pentobarbital, promethazine, opial, scopolamine we used before. In day-care surgery this short acting premedication in our opinion is quite useful.", 
    "32": "Binding of [3H]Ro5-4864, a specific ligand for \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine receptors, was determined in subcellular fractions of guinea pig lung. Even though the level of binding was predominant in the mitochondrial fraction, nuclear and cytosolic fractions also contained significantly measurable amounts of binding sites. The presence of binding sites in the microsomal fraction and in a fraction intermediate in density between the mitochondria and microsomes depended on which buffer was used to homogenize the tissue. If calcium-containing mannitol buffer was used, binding was negligible in the postmitochondrial organelles. However, in the case of sucrose buffer which did not contain any calcium, the postmitochondrial organelle fractions contained measurable amounts of binding sites. Most probably, these binding sites were of mitochondrial and nuclear origin. Furthermore, binding sites in the mitochondria were associated with the succinic dehydrogenase-enriched mitochondrial inner membrane, but not with the monoamine oxidase- and cholinephosphotransferase-enriched outer mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, several proteolytic enzymes caused a decrease in binding of the ligand to the mitochondrial membrane only under hypotonic conditions and not under isotonic conditions, suggesting that the location of the receptors is inside the mitochondria.", 
    "33": "[3H]Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, binds to two sites in the rat cerebellum, only one of which is sensitive to diazepam. The diazepam-insensitive component, whose identity is unknown, is unique to this brain area. We studied the binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 in cultured cerebellar granule cells to characterize its binding sites in a specified neuronal cell population and to determine the effects of ethanol on the binding. We also compared the properties of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in washed membranes of cultured cells and 14-day-old rat cerebella. [3H]Ro 15-4513 had two binding components in intact granule cells, one sensitive to diazepam, that probably represents binding to the benzodiazepine agonist site, the other sensitive to an antagonist (Ro 15-1788) and two inverse agonists (ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, beta CCE and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, DMCM) of the benzodiazepine receptor (diazepam-insensitive binding). This diazepam-insensitive binding was stimulated by GABA; the maximal increase in binding was about 60% with an EC50 of 0.3 microM. The effect of GABA (10 microM) on the diazepam-insensitive binding was unaffected by 100 microM nipecotic acid but was partially inhibited by 100 microM bicuculline. The stimulation by GABA was also seen at 37 degrees C with washed membranes of 14-day-old rat whole cerebella in the presence of micromolar diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The effects of several 5-HT1A agonists and excitatory amino acid antagonists were compared to the standard benzodiazepines, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in two assays predictive of anxiolytic activity, the social interaction and elevated plus maze procedures. Indicative of anxiolytic effects the 5-HT1A agonists, buspirone, gepirone and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) all significantly increased social interaction time and open arm exploration time in the social interaction and elevated plus maze procedures, respectively. Likewise, anxiolytic activity in these assays were also produced by the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5), 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP-7), 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) and the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801) while NMDA produced anxiogenic effects. Furthermore, the anxiolytic effects of these agents were of equal magnitude to the benzodiazepines. These two classes of compounds were differentiated in the yohimbine-induced seizure assay, with the NMDA antagonists dose dependently antagonizing seizures similar to the benzodiazepines while the 5-HT1A agonists were inactive. These results suggest that the 5-HT1A agonists and the NMDA antagonists may be potential non-classical anxiolytic agents with different mechanisms of action.", 
    "35": "A quantitative autoradiographic analysis of binding to 'central' benzodiazepine ([3H]flunitrazepam) receptors was carried out in 95 brain areas from entorhinal-kindled and handled control rats. Animals were sacrificed either 24 h or 28 days after the last kindled seizure. A significant post-kindling change was observed in only one area, the fascia dentata, which showed an elevation of 31% at 24 h, but not at 28 days. This change, which appeared in both the dorsal and ventral divisions of the hippocampus, was largest in the suprapyramidal layer. These data confirm previous reports of transient post-kindling binding changes in the fascia dentata, and extend them by suggesting that the fascia dentata is the only site in the brain which shows altered benzodiazepine binding after kindling. These transient and circumscribed changes are unlikely to contribute significantly to the 'kindled state', although they may relate to the enhancement of inhibitory effects observed in fascia dentata after kindling.", 
    "36": "Transplanted C3H mouse mammary tumours were given single doses of X irradiation in air or oxygen at 1 atmosphere (atm) with or without anaesthesia of the recipient mice by ketamine and diazepam. The radiation response to single doses of 25 Gy was determined in terms of the time taken to reach 3.5 times the treatment volume. Under all conditions there was more growth delay in tumours irradiated in pure oxygen than in air. In both air and oxygen, the radiation response for anaesthetized animals tended to fall below the level for non-anaesthetized ones when only 10 min had elapsed after the administration of anaesthesia. After 25 min, the response in air was back to the level for the non-anaesthetized animals but the oxygen group now showed significant sensitization compared with the oxygen without anaesthetic group. After 40 min, the air group now showed slight sensitization and the oxygen group still showed significant sensitization by the anaesthetic. These results demonstrate the importance of the time interval between anaesthesia and irradiation of mouse tumours.", 
    "37": "1. The effects of the platelet activating factor (Paf) antagonists alprazolam, BN 52021, kadsurenone, L 652,731 and SRI 63119 have been studied on Paf-induced chemiluminescence (CL) of guinea-pig, C. parvum-activated peritoneal macrophages in vitro. 2. All antagonists produced a shift to the right in the dose-response curve to Paf (0.001-10 mumol l-1). Schild plots for BN 52021, L 652,731, kadsurenone and SRI 63119 were linear, but only for BN 52021 and kadsurenone did the mean slope not differ significantly from unity. Mean pA2 values for BN 52021 and kadsurenone were 6.60 +/- 0.05 and 6.41 +/- 0.14 (mean + s.e.mean) respectively. Calculation of IC50 values for all antagonists (at 0.1 mumol l-1 Paf) gave an order of potency: L 652731 greater than kadsurenone greater than or equal to BN 52021 greater than alprazolam greater than SRI 63119. 3. When individual pA2 values for BN 52021 and kadsurenone were plotted against the maximal CL response to Paf of cell suspensions in the absence of antagonist (reflecting the degree of activation of the macrophages by the C. parvum), it was found that the affinity of both antagonists for macrophage Paf receptors remained relatively constant irrespective of the activation state of the cells. 4. We conclude that activation of guinea-pig peritoneal macrophages does not account for the increased affinity for macrophage Paf receptors previously observed for kadsurenone. Kadsurenone and BN 52021 presumably bind to a site on Paf receptors which is not affected by the activation process, while alprazolam and SRI 63119 are non-specific antagonists. The reason for the difference between the competitive nature of kadsurenone and its structural analogue L 652,731 is unclear.", 
    "38": "1. Under voltage-clamp dissociated adult and foetal rat superior cervical ganglion (s.c.g.) cells exhibited a non-inactivating voltage- and time-dependent component of K+ current termed the M-current (IM). IM was detected and measured from the current decay during hyperpolarizing voltage steps applied from potentials where IM was pre-activated. 2. Neither the resting membrane current nor the amplitude of these current decay relaxations were reduced by omitting Ca from the bathing fluid, showing that the M-current was not a 'Ca-activated' K-current dependent on a primary Ca-influx. Concentrations of (+)-tubocurarine sufficient to block the slow Ca-activated K-current IAHP did not inhibit IM or antagonize the effect of muscarinic agonists on IM, showing that IM was not contaminated by IAHP. Tetraethylammonium (1 mM), which blocks the fast Ca-activated K-current IC, produced a small inhibition of IM. This was not due to contamination of IM by IC since muscarinic agonists did not consistently block IC. 3. The muscarinic agonists muscarine, oxotremorine, McN-A-343 and methacholine reversibly suppressed IM, resulting in an inward (depolarizing) current. The rank order of potency was: oxotremorine greater than or equal to muscarine greater than McN-A-343 greater than methacholine. 4. The suppression of IM by muscarine was similar in cultured cells derived from adult and foetal tissue to that seen in the intact ganglia. 5. IM-suppression by muscarine was inhibited by pirenzepine (Pz) and AF-DX 116 with mean pKB values of 7.53 +/- 0.13 (n = 3) and 6.02 +/- 0.13 (n = 4) respectively. 6. The suppression of IM by muscarinic agonists was not affected by gallamine (10-30 microM). 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide inhibited the response at 300 nM. 7. Pirenzepine inhibited the contractions of the guinea-pig isolated ileum produced by muscarine with a mean pKB of 6.37 +/- 0.03 (n = 8). 8. These results suggest that the receptors mediating suppression of the M-current accord with those designated pharmacologically as M1 and that these receptors reach maturity at a very early stage in the development of the rat s.c.g.", 
    "39": "1. The action of hexamethonium has been studied at a range of muscarinic receptors in vitro by use of both functional and radioligand binding studies. 2. In functional studies, hexamethonium exhibited little or no significant (P less than 0.05) antagonism of contractile responses to carbachol at muscarinic receptors in the guinea-pig ileum, oesophageal muscularis mucosae, urinary bladder and trachea. However, antagonism was observed at muscarinic receptors in the guinea-pig left atria mediating negative inotropic responses and the calculated pKB value was 3.80. Hexamethonium also antagonized contractile responses to carbachol in the canine saphenous vein. The pKB value at these receptors was 3.75. 3. In the presence of 3.2 mM hexamethonium, the pA2 value for methoctramine at atrial muscarinic receptors was reduced by approximately 10 fold (control pA2 value was 7.81 +/- 0.05; pA2 value in hexamethonium was 6.73 +/- 0.04). In contrast at tracheal muscarinic receptors, the pA2 values for methoctramine were unaffected in the presence of 3.2 mM hexamethonium (control pA2 = 5.58 +/- 0.07; pA2 value in hexamethonium was 5.63 +/- 0.12). All values quoted are mean +/- s.e. mean, n = 8. 4. In competition radioligand binding studies, hexamethonium exhibited a higher affinity for cardiac M2 receptors (pKi = 3.68) than for cerebrocortical M1 receptors (pKi = 3.28) or for submaxillary gland M3 receptors (pKi = 2.61). At M2 receptors hexamethonium at concentrations of 0.1-10 mM, increased the half life of the dissociation rate of [3H]-N-methylscopolamine 1.6-4.3 fold. This was observed at M3 receptors only at 10 mM, when the half life was increased 1.7 fold. 5. We conclude that hexamethonium, in addition to its well characterized nicotinic antagonist properties, can act as a weak muscarinic antagonist and differentiates between cardiac M2 receptors and glandular/smooth muscle M3 receptors. However, hexamethonium differentiates less clearly between M1 and M2 receptors. The selectivity between M2 and M3 receptors observed in the present study with hexamethonium is comparable to other M2 selective antagonists such as AF-DX 116 and himbacine. 6. Caution should be exercised with regard to the inclusion of hexamethonium in functionsal studies of M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes at concentrations of 0.1 mm and above.", 
    "40": "The N-demethylation of ethylmorphine was studied in liver microsomes from human fetuses and adult patients as well as from human fetal adrenals and kidneys. Unexpectedly the reaction was catalysed at the same rate in fetal (42.3-1277.4 pmol/mg/min in 11 individuals) and adult microsomes (414-1617.8 pmol/mg/min in two individuals), which also had similar values of the apparent Km (1.50, 1.72 mM respectively) and Vmax (1.33, 1.81 nmol/mg/min respectively) in studies of the enzyme kinetics. There was a close correlation (r = 0.96) between the semiquantitative immunoblotting assessment of cytochrome P-450 HL-p in fetal liver microsomes (with the use of a monoclonal antibody against pregnenolone-16-alpha-carbonitrile induced rat hepatic cytochrome P-450) and the catalytic activity. The fetal adrenal microsomal N-demethylation was only 11-30% of the hepatic activity when compared within three fetuses in which such a comparison was possible. No activity was measurable in the kidneys. Two drugs that are believed to be substrates of the cytochrome P-450 HLp were tested as inhibitors of the ethylmorphine N-demethylation in human fetal and adult liver microsomes and in rat liver microsomes. Midazolam was a potent inhibitor (100% at 0.4 mM) of the reaction in all specimens, whereas cyclosporin A inhibited the reaction clearly only in adult liver microsomes. Endogenous steroids of importance in the fetal circulation were also tested as inhibitors. Progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone inhibited the reaction by 75-80% at a concentration of 0.4 mM, whereas pregnenolone and 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were almost devoid of inhibitory potency. These results are of interest in the discussion about the physiological role of the human fetal cytochrome P-450 HLp which has an unprecedented relative abundance in the liver.", 
    "41": "We investigated in vitro the influence of flunitrazepam concentrations ranged between 10 and 140 ng/ml on immunological parameters by using the rosette-inhibition-test and the lymphocyte-transformation-test. After addition of 30 ng/ml flunitrazepam, which is in accordance with a threshold concentration of 1 mg flunitrazepam after intravenous injection, we saw a significant decrease of the positive cells in the rosette-inhibition-test. In higher concentrations no significant changes could be observed. By the lymphocyte-transformation-test no significant evidence of immunodepression could be demonstrated in concentration usually achieved during anaesthesia or possibly after long term application in intensive care unit, independent of the used mitogenes. Thus, flunitrazepam demonstrates no immunosuppressive effect in concentrations achieved during anaesthesia or in intensive care unit as could be observed by tests of cellular immune competence. However, one has to take into consideration that only parts of the immunesystem could be examined with these tests and in vivo-investigations have to verify these results.", 
    "42": "Electroacupuncture-induced analgesia (EAA), as assessed in terms of tail flick latency in adult male albino rats, was reduced or completely withdrawn by co-treatment of diazepam with electroacupuncture (EA) (10 Hz, 1 volt), although diazepam (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) alone had no analgesic effect. Further, it was found that only the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system of thalamus and pons-medulla regions were involved in EAA. The EA-induced inhibition of GABAergic activity in the thalamus and pons-medulla was disinhibited when diazepam was pre-administered to rats treated with a single EA and reduced the EAA.", 
    "43": "Excitatory synaptic transmission, induced by electrical stimulation of optic nerve fibres on relay neurones, was recorded from in vitro preparations of the optic tectum of the frog. Bath-applied glutamate (the putative excitatory transmitter of the optic nerve) produced transient enhancement of tectal field potentials, followed by a depression, presumably caused by sustained neuronal depolarization. Pentobarbitone potently antagonized the depressant effect of glutamate, producing an approximate 50% reduction in the response of the tectum to glutamate at 25 microM. Midazolam also decreased the effect of glutamate with an IC50 value of 5 nM. Since, in the optic tectum of the frog, neither pentobarbitone nor midazolam enhance responses to bath-applied GABA, it is suggested that this area of the brain is a useful preparation in which to investigate the interaction of barbiturates and benzodiazepines with glutamate receptor mechanisms, without concurrent interactions with GABAergic processes.", 
    "44": "The effects of the potent and selective CCK antagonist, MK-329, on morphine- and environmentally-induced analgesia were examined in male mice. The results show that MK-329 (0.005-0.1 mg/kg) was devoid of intrinsic analgetic activity on the mouse tail-flick assay and, over the dose range 0.01-0.5 mg/kg, was without significant effect upon non-opioid analgesia, induced by defeat experience. However, opposite effects of MK-329 on analgesia induced by morphine and opioid-mediated social conflict analgesia were observed. That is, 0.05-0.01 mg/kg MK-329 (but not smaller doses) enhanced, and modestly prolonged, the duration of analgesia induced by 5 mg/kg morphine. In direct contrast, 0.0001-0.5 mg/kg of the CCK antagonist very potently inhibited opioid-typical analgesia in mice exposed to intense conspecific attack. In the latter studies, a residual short-lasting analgesia in mice, treated with MK-329, was found to be resistant to naloxone (5 mg/kg), indicating its non-opioid nature and confirming the lack of effect of the CCK antagonist on opioid-independent analgesia. It is suggested that the variable effects of MK-329 on morphine-induced and opioid-mediated social conflict analgesia may reflect differential, dose-dependent effects at CCK-B and CCK-A sites respectively, a proposal consistent with the 500-fold potency difference observed between the two models.", 
    "45": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) of porcine cerebral membrane (predominantly M1 subtype) and porcine atrial membrane (M2 subtype) showed the same affinity for the muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinylbenzylate [( 3H]QNB). In contrast, the affinity for pirenzepine (another muscarinic antagonist) of 86% of binding sites in the cerebral membrane (H sites) was 34-fold higher than that in the atrial membrane. After purification of mAChRs by affinity chromatography, this difference was less than 3-fold. This phenomenon was fully reversed by insertion of purified mAChRs into either cerebral or atrial membranes whose native muscarinic binding sites had been alkylated with propylbenzilycholine mustard, indicating that the purified receptors recovered their original affinities for pirenzepine upon interaction with membrane components. To examine the effect of the interaction between receptors and lipid components on the affinities for [3H]QNB and pirenzepine, binding experiments were carried out with mAChRs inserted into various lipid preparations. When purified cerebral and atrial mAChRs were inserted into cholesteryl hemisuccinate, their affinities for [3H]QNB and pirenzepine became close to the membrane values and were 7- and 50- to 60-fold higher than those of receptors inserted into phosphatidylcholine, respectively. When insertion was carried out into either cholesteryl hemisuccinate, phosphatidylcholine, or cholesteryl hemisuccinate/phosphatidylcholine mixtures, (80:20 and 50:50, w/w), the affinity of cerebral H sites for pirenzepine was only 3- to 5-fold higher than that of atrial receptors, but it became 20- and 60-fold higher when the receptors were inserted in a cholesteryl hemisuccinate/phosphatidylcholine mixture (20:80, w/w) and in a cholesteryl hemisuccinate/phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol mixture (4:48:48, w/w), respectively. These results suggest that the affinities of mAChRs for antagonists, in particular the differential affinities of cerebral and atrial mAChRs for pirenzepine, are modulated by the lipid environment.", 
    "46": "The case history of a patient with presumed psychogenic catatonia who responded dramatically to two mg of IM lorazepam is presented. This patient, who had been largely mute and immobile for over a week despite neuroleptic therapy, became freely conversant and mobile within 30 minutes of the administration of lorazepam. This response was repeated the next day after the patient had again become mute and immobile. Catatonia and its diverse etiologies are discussed, with an emphasis on its syndromic nature. The literature on the response of catatonia to the benzodiazepines is reviewed and it is suggested that a trial of benzodiazepines may be helpful in both the evaluation and long term management of patients with catatonia.", 
    "47": "To explore the physiology of cholecystokinin (CCK) in humans, we investigated the effect on gallbladder contraction and gastric emptying of a recently developed CCK receptor antagonist, MK-329. In a double-blind, four-period crossover study eight subjects received single doses of 0.5, 2, or 10 mg MK-329, or placebo, followed by an intravenous infusion of CCK-8 (30 pmol/kg.h). In placebo-treated subjects gallbladder volumes decreased on average to 43% of initial volumes after 2 h of CCK infusion. MK-329 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of CCK-stimulated gallbladder contraction with 10 mg producing complete blockade (P less than 0.01, cf. placebo). Gallbladder contraction and gastric emptying rates after a mixed meal were then measured in a two-period crossover study. Subjects received placebo or 10 mg of MK-329 2 h before eating. Gastric emptying of both solids and liquids was measured simultaneously by gamma scintigraphy. In placebo-treated subjects plasma CCK levels increased postprandially to 2.3 pM, gallbladder volumes decreased 68.4 +/- 3.8% (SE), and the times for 50% emptying of liquids and solids from the stomach were 58 +/- 10 and 128 +/- 8 min, respectively. In MK-329-treated subjects there was a marked elevation in peak CCK levels to 13.8 pM (P less than 0.01, cf. placebo), and gallbladder contraction was completely inhibited. Solid and liquid emptying rates were unaffected. These findings demonstrate that (a) MK-329 is a potent, orally active antagonist of CCK in humans, and (b) CCK is the major regulator of postprandial gallbladder contraction. These data also support the concept of negative feedback regulation of CCK secretion and suggest that mechanisms other than CCK play a dominant role in the regulation of postprandial gastric emptying rates.", 
    "48": "The tissue uptake of extensively plasma-bound compounds is reportedly inconsistent with the conventional free-drug hypothesis limiting transport to unbound moiety in rapid intracapillary equilibrium with bound complex. Instead, protein-mediated/cell surface enhancement of dissociation has been postulated to occur in the microvasculature. This possibility was investigated by studying the passive transport of diazepam across the blood-brain barrier. Microdialysis probes placed within the vena cava and brain cortex were used to directly compare steady-state, interstitial unbound diazepam levels in both Wistar and genetically analbuminemic rats. The absence of albumin in the latter increased the unbound fraction of diazepam by almost fivefold; however, in both groups, the ratio of unbound concentrations in brain and blood at equilibrium was equal to unity. If enhanced dissociation occurred in the microvasculature, then the unbound brain level should have been greater than that in the systemic circulation. It is probable that earlier findings suggestive of protein-mediated transport reflect a nonequilibrium phenomenon. Comparison of the extent of diazepam's in vivo binding in blood by microdialysis to that estimated in vitro using conventional equilibrium dialysis with microcells showed good agreement, thus validating a widely accepted assumption of equivalency of these two values.", 
    "49": "Pulmonary vascular responses to acetylcholine were compared under resting and high tone conditions of the intact-chest rabbit. Under resting tone conditions, intralobar injections of acetylcholine increased lobar arterial pressure in a dose-related manner. The pressor responses to acetylcholine under resting conditions were blocked by meclofenamate, indomethacin, atropine, and pirenzepine. When lobar vascular resistance was raised to a high steady level, low doses of acetylcholine decreased lobar arterial pressure, whereas higher doses elicited a biphasic response with the pressor component predominating at the highest dose studied. Under high tone conditions, only the pressor component of the response was blocked by meclofenamate or indomethacin, whereas pressor and depressor responses were blocked by atropine or the 600-micrograms/kg iv dose of pirenzepine. Pressor responses to acetylcholine under resting and high tone conditions were blocked by pirenzepine (50 micrograms/kg iv), whereas gallamine had no effect on responses to acetylcholine. The 50-micrograms/kg iv dose of pirenzepine had no effect on depressor responses or the depressor component of the response to acetylcholine. The present data support the concept that acetylcholine has significant cyclooxygenase-dependent pressor activity in the rabbit pulmonary vascular bed and suggest that this response is mediated by a muscarinic M1-type receptor. These data also show that, under high tone conditions, a vasodilator response or a vasodilator component of a biphasic response is unmasked. This response is not dependent on the release of cyclooxygenase products and is mediated by a muscarinic receptor that is neither of the M1- nor the M2-type.", 
    "50": "Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a standard two-choice Drug 1-Drug 2 discrimination task utilizing 3.0 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide (CDP, an anxiolytic drug) and 20 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, an anxiogenic drug) as discriminative stimuli under a VR 5-15 schedule of food reinforcement. Saline tests conducted at specific time points after acute high doses of ethanol (3.0 and 4.0 g/kg) indicated a delayed rebound effect, evidenced by a shift to PTZ-appropriate responding. Insofar as such a shift in lever selection indexes a delayed anxiety-like state, this acute 'withdrawal' reaction can be said to induce an affective state similar to that seen with chronic ethanol withdrawal states. Ethanol generalization tests: (1) resulted in a dose- and time-dependent biphasic generalization to CDP, (2) failed to block the PTZ stimulus and (3) failed to block the time- and dose-dependent elicitation of an ethanol-rebound effect. These data suggest that ethanol's anxiolytic effects are tenuous.", 
    "51": "The standard procedure for percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB) involves only the use of local anesthesia. However, at times, a PLB can be frightening and uncomfortable. Such experiences often limit the willingness of patients to undergo subsequent follow-up biopsies. To investigate the ability of midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine preparation, noted for its potency, rapid onset of action, and amnestic qualities, to enhance patient acceptability of a follow-up liver biopsy, a \"sedative dose\" of midazolam (2 mg) or saline was administered immediately prior to and following a percutaneous liver biopsy. The initial dose was used to sedate the subject while not impairing patient cooperation during the biopsy procedure; the second dose was used to induce amnesia for the biopsy procedure. The next morning patient recollection for the preceding biopsy procedure and their willingness to undergo a future PLB were assessed using a questionnaire. Forty-one patients (ages 18-78) were randomized to receive either midazolam (N = 21) or saline/placebo N = 20) treatment. All PLBs were obtained with a Trucut needle. All subjects were given 2-5 cc of 2% xylocaine local anesthetic at the biopsy site. The questionnaire utilized evaluated patient experience of the procedure with respect to their recall, level of anxiety during the procedure, and willingness to undergo a repeat procedure. The data obtained revealed that those receiving midazolam admitted to experiencing less discomfort during the biopsy procedure (P less than 0.04) and had less memory for the procedure (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "This HPLC method for measuring antipyrine, lorazepam, and indocyanine green in 0.5 mL of plasma can be used in studies of liver function in which these \"model\" compounds are used. After a fast, simple, one-step extraction procedure with acetonitrile, an isocratic HPLC system is used, with a single detection wavelength (214 nm) and a single internal standard (1-acetamidopyrene). The mobile phase is a 47/53 (by vol) mixture of acetonitrile and 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 6. The three compounds are separated on an LC-18 reversed-phase column. The low cost of the HPLC method makes feasible the routine clinical measurement of all three compounds.", 
    "53": "The first-pass uptake of verapamil, diazepam, and thiopental in the human lung was determined using multiple-indicator dilution techniques. These three drugs represent lipid-soluble agents that differ in their ionic characteristics at physiological pH. Verapamil, a basic lipophilic amine, underwent significant uptake, with 50% of the drug accumulating in lung tissue during the first pass. With diazepam, a nonbasic lipophilic amine, there was 30% uptake during the first pass through the human lung--significantly less than that observed with verapamil. With thiopental, an acidic lipophilic barbiturate, only 14% of the injected drug accumulated in the lung during the first pass. Taken together, these data are consistent with observations from animal studies, which indicate that extensive pulmonary uptake is greater with basic amine drugs that are moderately to highly lipid-soluble. Also, the relatively high first-pass uptake of verapamil in the human lung suggests a quantitatively significant role of this nonrespiratory function of the lung in the early pharmacokinetics of intravenous verapamil.",

    "55": "This report describes the purification and characterization from rat brain of triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN, DBI 17-50), a major biologically active processing product of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI). Brain TTN was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with polyclonal octadecaneuropeptide, DBI 33-50) antibodies coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B followed by two reverse-phase HPLC steps. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide is: Thr-Gln-Pro-Thr-Asp-Glu-Glu-Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Tyr-Ser-His-Phe-Lys-Gln-Ala-Thr-Val - Gly-Asp-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp-Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys. Synthetic TTN injected intracerebroventricularly into rats induces a proconflict activity (IC50 0.8 nmol/rat) that is prevented by the specific \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist isoquinoline carboxamide, PK 11195, but not by the \"central\" BZ receptor antagonist imidazobenzodiazepine, flumazenil. TTN displaces [3H]Ro 5-4864 from synaptic membranes of olfactory bulb with a Ki of approximately 5 microM. TTN also enhances picrotoxinin inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding. These data suggest that TTN, a natural DBI processing product acting at \"Ro 5-4864 preferring\" BZ binding site subtypes, might function as a putative neuromodulator of specific GABAA receptor-mediated effects.", 
    "56": "A double blind study was carried out on the effect of pirenzepine on bronchial reactivity assessed by metacholine provocation. The study was carried out on 19 patients with bronchial asthma. Bronchial provocation tests was performed according to the method of Ryan et al using the DeVilbis 646 nebuliser coupled to the Rosenthal--French dosimeter. Spirometric parameters were assessed using Vitalograph. The results show a significant protective effect of pirenzepine on bronchial spasm induced by metacholine.", 
    "57": "The authors have compared two different techniques of anaesthesia: the classical anaesthesia with benzodiazepine-analgesic (diazepam and fentanyl) and one of its variant obtained by using flunitrazepam and buprenorphine. The 45 patients submitted to gynaecological surgery were causally divided in two groups in connection with the two different anaesthesiological techniques. The clinical and statistical analysis of the collected data demonstrated the real validity of this anaesthesiological variant: either for premedication by perfect anxiolysis and sedation, or for the maintenance by low incidence on cardiocirculation system and perfect analgesia that extended its effects for many hours after surgical operation.", 
    "58": "Steroids and cytostatic drugs have an undoubtedly damaging action on the gastroduodenal mucosa. The action of pirenzepine was compared with that of the placebo in preventing the gastroduodenal lesions brought on by antiblastic therapy. Sixty patients were separated into two random group under double blind conditions and received 100 mg/die/os of pirenzepine or equivalent placebo for a continuous period of 12 weeks. Antiblastic drugs were administered at the same time. Final endoscopic control and symptomatological findings showed a statistically significant different in favour of the pirenzepine-treated group as early as the 6th week of treatment. No side-effects attributable to pirenzepine were reported.", 
    "59": "In double-blind sequential study, diazepam was compared with the proven antidepressant moclobemide, in patients with atypical depression. Both agents significantly improved depression ratings over eight weeks of treatment. Diazepam was a significantly better antidepressant than moclobemide at four week, although not at eight weeks. All patients ceased diazepam within one year and none reported withdrawal reactions. These data suggest the need to reconsider that benzodiazepines may be antidepressants and to study their possible antidepressant actions.", 
    "60": "This was a multicentre prospectively randomized double-blind parallel comparison of clovoxamine (n = 37) and diazepam (n = 35) in 72 patients suffering from anxiety neurosis, in general practice. Patients were seen weekly. Treatment was for 4 weeks (50 mg clovoxamine b.d. or 5 mg diazepam b.d.) rising according to response to a maximum of 300 mg clovoxamine or 30 mg diazepam daily. Drug was tapered off in week 5 and patients were seen again in week 6 after they had been off drug for at least a week. A treatment period of 4 weeks was selected in line with WHO guidelines for the testing of anxiolytic drugs. Although more patients dropped out due to intolerance on clovoxamine (24%) compared with diazepam (11%), analysis of completed patients showed that clovoxamine was equally effective with significant improvement in both groups at week 4 (p less than .001) compared with baseline Morbid Anxiety Inventory scores and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores. Diazepam patients had a more rapid response which levelled off, whereas those on clovoxamine continued to improve after 2 weeks. At 6 weeks after taper off the improvement on clovoxamine was sustained whereas on diazepam there was evidence of deterioration after stopping the drug. Clovoxamine appears to have potential as an alternative treatment to diazepam for anxiety in general practice.", 
    "61": "A conflict task that does not require food or water deprivation is described. Drugs with known anticonflict action including chlordiazepoxide, methysergide, ethanol, and TRH were active in this test while amphetamine, buspirone, and morphine were not. Because this procedure did not require food or water deprivation, the effect of chronic ethanol administered in a liquid diet on the anticonflict actions of ethanol and chlordiazepoxide could be examined. Seven or 12 days of chronic ethanol treatment resulted in tolerance to the acute anticonflict action of ethanol whereas 3 days of treatment did not. Tolerance was not observed to a dose of ethanol administered 3 hr after a previous ethanol treatment. Following a chronic ethanol liquid diet, cross-tolerance to the anticonflict action of chloridazepoxide was observed. This latter observation is consistent with the view that ethanol influences a neural mechanism associated with benzodiazepine function. The importance of tolerance to the anticonflict action of ethanol is discussed.", 
    "62": "Parenterally administered magnesium is a reliable and effective treatment to prevent and control convulsions associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia. Because of several side effects in the newborn, especially in the premature child, benzodiazepines are not recommended for prolonged medication. Clomethiazole has also been used with good acceptance, but clinical experience is limited. The anticonvulsive property of magnesium is not clearly understood. Beside a well known peripheral action by neuromuscular blockade through very high serum concentrations, a central mechanism is postulated already at lower levels. The two most widely used regimens of magnesium administration are the intravenous/intramuscular (i.v./i.m.) method popularized by Pritchard and the continuous intravenous (i.v.) route recommended by Zuspan. The concentrations of magnesium in the serum achieved with the i.v./i.m. regimen are significantly higher than those produced by the i.v. administration, especially in the first three hours after initiation of the treatment and if a maintenance dose of 1 g/h is chosen. Although therapeutic concentrations of magnesium effective to prevent seizures have been reported between 1.3 and 4.0 mmol/l, repeated convulsions are occasionally seen during i.v. regimen and at concentrations below 2 mmol/l. Because of this observation, a maintenance dose of 2 g/h and in some cases 3 g/h is required during the first hours of treatment. Side effects in mother and newborn are low, if there is no renal impairment and the treatment instructions are strictly followed. Respiration as well as urinary output have to be monitored at periodic intervals and the patellar reflex should be present. Calcium gluconate, 10 ml of a 10% solution, is an effective antidote in case of magnesium intoxication.", 
    "63": "Based on pharmacologic-pharmacokinetic data a critical synopsis of the role of anticonvulsant plasma level determinations in the treatment of epilepsy is given. The analytical methods themselves and the validity of the so called therapeutic range are evaluated in general as well as for the particular antiepileptic drugs. Whereas plasma levels of phenytoin play an important role in therapeutic management they are without major relevance in the therapy with clonazepam and other benzodiazepines. Determinations of anticonvulsant concentrations can be of help in certain circumstances of therapeutic decisions, but uncritical usage as a routine method has to be discouraged. So far, prospective studies were not able to proof a general advantage of this method in the management of epileptic patients.", 
    "64": "Although often used in the medical management of anxiety, insomnia, seizures and muscle spasm, benzodiazepines lead to significant complications after continuous use. These complications include tolerance, addiction, dependence and abuse.

    "65": "These therapeutic approaches to the premedication of children, in our opinion, offer a more rational, probably safer, and at least equally efficacious treatment regimen as the DPT/lytic cocktail. It is understood that controlled, double-blind comparative clinical trials in children are needed of these or other potential premedicant regimens for specific pediatric procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, CT scans, bone marrow aspiration, gastrointestinal endoscopy, pleural taps, etc.) to establish the premedication treatment(s) with the greatest benefit-to-risk ratio. Until these data are available, we must maintain prudence in the selection (design) of premedicant regimens and carefully monitor all children receiving these \"cocktails.\"", 
    "66": "Comparison is made between subjective and objective measurements of opiate withdrawal severity in a group of 24 regular opiate takers undergoing inpatient detoxification. A lack of correlation is found between patients' subjective ratings, objective nurse ratings and physiological parameters of withdrawal severity.

    "67": "In a random trial on 40 patients undergoing extraction of the third lower molar 0.125 mg of triazolam were administered sublingually to 20 patients and placebo (lactulose solution 66.7%) to 20 patients. The sedative and amnesic effect rapidly appeared after triazolam while the anxiolytic effect was less pronounced. The recovery of psychomotor functions measured by standard psychomotor tests occurred rapidly and all patients were discharged after about 120 min from the end of the surgery. The judgment of the surgeon was positive as far as the anxiolytic and relaxing effects of triazolam was concerned. The patients treated with triazolam moreover appreciated the sedation induced by the drug. No cardiocirculatory complication was observed and the patients showed a considerable stability from the circulatory stand point. The results show that triazolam may represent a safe alternative to the use of other anxiolytic and sedative drugs in the minor surgery of the oral cavity.", 
    "68": "The single dose pharmacokinetics of flutoprazepam and its active N-desalkyl metabolite were determined in 8 normal subjects by using newly developed, highly sensitive, GC-MS and HPLC techniques. Following a 2 mg dose of the drug, the concentrations of unchanged flutoprazepam in serum were extremely low (below 5 ng/ml at 2 h) and declined rapidly to undetectable levels within 6-9 h after dosing. At all sampling times, the serum concentration of the N-dealkylated metabolite (N-desalkylflurazepam) was much greater than that of the parent compound. This metabolite appeared in serum rapidly (within 2 h), reached a peak between 2 and 12 h and declined slowly, with an elimination half-life of about 90 h on average. The serum concentration of two additional putative metabolites (3-hydroxy-flutoprazepam and N-desalkyl-3-hydroxy-flutoprazepam) was below the limit of detection (2 ng/ml) in all samples. Mild CNS effects (documented by prolonged choice reaction time) were present at 2 and 4 h but were no longer detectable at 9 h. It is suggested that unchanged flutoprazepam is unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical effects and that the drug exerts its therapeutic activity through conversion to the slowly eliminated N-desalkyl metabolite.", 
    "69": "The onset of behavioral estrus was used as a phase marker of the hamster timing system in SLD 16:8 (dark 20:00-04:00). TZ was injected between 11:00 of cycle day 3 and noon of cycle day 4 when onset of estrus was determined. At no time did injection of TZ cause a phase advance in SLD 16:8. Small delays of estrus resulted from 11:00-16:00 injections but marked delays began with the 17:00 injection. Phenobarbital was injected between noon and 19:30 on cycle day 3. Injections between noon and 16:00 had no effect but all later injections beginning at 17:00 delayed estrus, the 17:30 injection causing the greatest delay. Diazepam also markedly delayed estrus when tested at 17:30. These results with three drugs support results with light pulses that 18:00 in SLD 16:8 marks the same phase of the 24-h hamster timing system as the onset of wheel running does in DD, LL, and WLD. These findings with three GABA potentiators extend to SLD previous evidence based on the onset of wheel running in DD, LL and WLD that GABA may be involved in hamster timekeeping and its responses to light and drugs.", 
    "70": "The possibility that metoclopramide (MCP) stimulates arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion in man through a serotoninergic and/or a cholinergic muscarinic pathway was studied. Twenty normal male subjects were tested with MCP (10 mg in an i.v. bolus) alone or in the presence of the 5HT1 serotoninergic antagonist metergoline (10 mg/day p.o. in five divided doses for 4 days), the 5HT2 receptor blocker ketanserin (10 mg i.v. 5 min before MCP) (n = 10), the M1 and M2 muscarinic antagonist atropine (1.2 mg i.v. just before MCP administration) or the M1 muscarinic receptor blocker pirenzepine (40 mg i.v. 10 min before MCP) (n = 10). AVP doubled in response to MCP. the MCP-induced AVP rise did not change after metergoline, ketanserin or pirenzepine administration, whereas it was abolished by atropine. Additional experiments were performed in order to evaluate the effect of 1.2 mg atropine, given alone, on circulating AVP levels and whether the effect of atropine on the AVP response to MCP depends on the amount of the muscarinic antagonist (dose-response study). For these purposes, atropine was given alone to the same subjects previously tested with MCP plus atropine; furthermore, eight additional male subjects were tested with MCP plus atropine given in doses ranging from 0.8 to 1.4 mg. The results of these additional studies failed to show an effect of atropine alone on AVP secretion and demonstrated a dose-related inhibition of MCP-induced AVP rise by increasing atropine administration from 0.8 mg to 1.2 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The effect of oral administration of buspirone (0.5-1.0 and 2.0 mg/Kg) on GSH levels was studied in rat liver. The modulating activity of buspirone on hepatic content of this tripeptide is clearly opposite to that of DAZ, put into evidence by us in previous works. Thus our observations let us hypothesize a different mechanism of action for buspirone than that for benzodiazepines.", 
    "72": "We report a simple, one-trial, learning paradigm which we have developed for use in young chicks. Chicks were separated from their brood mates and placed in a small isolation chamber. A 'T' corridor, or maze, connected the isolation chamber to the brood space, allowing the chick to escape isolation stress and rejoin the brood. When the chick successfully negotiated the corridor, the latency to perform this task was recorded. On a subsequent trial, any improvement in the speed of performance was reasoned to reflect the chick's memory of the task. Undrugged chicks always showed significant improvement in task latency if they were replaced in the maze 3 hours after a successful escape, suggesting that they had remembered the task. Chicks given midazolam (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg, IP), a benzodiazepine, before the first escape, showed no improvement on their second escape. Improved performance was seen, however, if a second injection of midazolam was given before the second escape, suggesting a state-dependent effect.", 
    "73": "The present study investigates whether clonazepam exerts its antimyoclonic action through a GABA independent mechanism. We have studied the antimyoclonic effect of clonazepam and compared it with that of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a GABA transaminase inhibitor, against myoclonus induced by picrotoxin, a GABA receptor antagonist and allylglycine, a drug which inhibits synthesis and release of GABA. We have also investigated the effect of clonazepam against picrotoxin-induced myoclonus in rats pretreated with either AOAA or submyoclonic dose of allylgylycine. Clonazepam pretreatment inhibited both picrotoxin and allylglycine-induced myoelonus whereas AOAA was effective in inhibiting only picrotoxin-induced myoclonus. The protective effect of clonazepam against picrotoxin-induced myoclonus was potentiated by AOAA pretreatment. Moreover, clonazepam afforded protection against picrotoxin-induced myoclonus in rats pretreated with a submyoclonic GABA reducing dose of allylglycine. These findings indicate that a GABA independent mechanism may also be involved in the antimyoclonic action of clonazepam.", 
    "74": "Comparative evaluation of two isolation methods in fatal chlozepid poisoning was performed using expert material. Isolation by neutral acetone from visceral tissues showed that chlozepid and its metabolites are extracted in amounts 6-13 times greater (in terms of chlozepid) than using A. A. Vasil'eva's method. Quantitative determination was performed by photometry according to the reaction of azo dye formation after hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of the extracts.", 
    "75": "Forty-three patients with duodenal ulcer were treated with almagel and gastrocepin, had four meals a day. Twenty-one patients received the drugs according to the standard schedule before meals. The test group of 22 patients took meals and drugs in turn during 24 hours with the aim of a continuous moderate reduction of acidity and activity of proteolytic enzymes. Statistical analysis of the results showed a shorter duration of the ulcer healing in the test group. This conclusion permits recommending the above novel modification of the standard treatment for use in duodenal ulcer treatment as advantageous.", 
    "76": "The effects of an intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8, 1 microgram.kg-1.h-1) were investigated in conscious fasted dogs chronically fitted with strain-gauge transducers on the antrum, the jejunum, and the colon. Attempts to antagonize the increase of motility appearing at the three levels during CCK infusion were made using different blockers to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Asperlicin (a specific CCK antagonist) blocked the effects of CCK-8 at the three levels, while atropine and somatostatin were only effective in the jejunum and colon. Methyl-levallorphan (a mu-opiate antagonist that poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier) antagonized the CCK-induced colonic stimulation when intracerebroventricularly administered. Serotonin, histamine, substance P, and K-antagonists as well as a benzodiazepine did not modify the CCK-8 induced stimulation. It was concluded that the stimulatory effect of CCK-8 resulted from (a) a direct stimulation of the smooth muscle cells at gastric level, (b) a cholinergic activation of the jejunum and the colon, and (c) the involvement of a mu-opioid central component in the colonic response only.", 
    "77": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, the CNS effects of intravenously administered diazepam and lorazepam were investigated in anxious subjects through the quantitative pharmaco-EEG (QPEEG) method. For up to 4 1/2 hours following administration the effects of each substance on brain function were measured using computer analyzed EEG recordings (CEEG) and a new technique called Dynamic Brain Mapping. The following observations were made: 1. Both active drugs produce statistically significant CNS effects as measured by CEEG changes. These changes were observed earlier with diazepam than with lorazepam. 2. Although both compounds are classified as anxiolytic by the routine computer EEG data base, the detailed brain mapping technology indicated that the CNS effects of diazepam and lorazepam were quantitatively and qualitatively different. 3. Clinical CNS side-effects (sedation) were seen more frequently with lorazepam than with diazepam. This was consistent with the EEG slowing producing properties of lorazepam. The EEG fast activity which is characteristic for all anxiolytics was established more with diazepam than lorazepam.", 
    "78": "Two complimentary assay techniques were used to determine triazolam levels in greyhound urine samples following a single oral dose. The results from the trials were statistically compared. The relative non-specificity of the benzodiazepine antibody used in radioimmunoassay caused a significant difference in teh two sets of results. This was independent of hydrolysis.", 
    "79": "Enantiomers of oxazepam and of 3-O-acyl, 1-N-acyl-3-O-acyl, and 3-O-methyl ether derivatives of oxazepam were resolved on HPLC columns packed with Pirkle's chiral stationary phases [CSP; (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine or (S)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)leucine] bonded either ionically or covalently to spherical particles of gamma-aminopropylsilanized silica, and on a column packed with poly-N-acryloyl-(S)-phenylalanine ethyl ester bonded covalently to silica gel (Chiraspher). Resolution was achieved, with several mobile phases of different solvent compositions and with varying chromatographic resolutions, on all of the chiral stationary phases tested. Resolved enantiomers of oxazepam undergo racemization, whereas enantiomers of 3-O-acyl and 3-O-methyl derivatives are stable. Racemization half-lives of oxazepam enantiomers were determined by monitoring changes in ellipticity as a function of time on a spectropolarimeter immediately (within 30 s) following resolution of enantiomers and were found to substantially vary, depending on the solvents used. Rates of hydrolysis of racemic and enantiomeric 3-O-acyl-oxazepams by esterases in liver microsomes and brain homogenate of rats were determined by a simple and sensitive CSP-HPLC method. The relative rate of hydrolysis was 3R greater than racemate much greater than 3S by rat liver microsomes and 3S greater than racemate much greater than 3R by rat brain homogenate.",

There was a weak association between elevated pretreatment levels of MHPG and a positive treatment response to alprazolam or diazepam. Alprazolam and diazepam may differ in their effects on MHPG.", 
    "81": "The distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) was investigated in the monkey brain by means of quantitative in vitro autoradiography. 3H-QNB, 3H-pirenzepine (PZ) and 3H-AF-DX 116 were used for labelling total mAChR, M1 and M2 receptors, respectively. 3H-PZ and 3H-AF-DX 116 showed specificity to each receptor subtype in the monkey brain. On sections containing the putamen and globus pallidus, the sum of Bmax values of 3H-PZ and 3H-AF-DX 116 binding sites was almost close to that of 3H-QNB binding sites. Autoradiographic distributions of muscarinic subtype receptors in the monkey brain were similar to those reported in the rat brain; that is, M1 receptors were dominant in most areas of the telencephalon, while M2 receptors were richly distributed in the brainstem and cerebellum. However, some nuclei of the brainstem such as the central gray matter, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, nucleus of the oculomotor nerve, pontine nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus, had relatively high ratios of M1 receptors in the monkey brain. In addition, the cortical lamminar distribution of M2 receptors noticed in the rat was not observed in the monkey brain. Knowledge about the localizations of M1 and M2 receptors in various brain regions in the monkey brain will increase our understanding of the functions of the brain cholinergic system in the primate.", 
    "82": "Four juvenile male baboons were trained on a delayed match-to-sample (MTS) discrimination task. Single administration of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mg/kg diazepam (DZ) resulted in a dose-related increase in mean response time (MRT), with a maximum effect at 2.0 mg/kg. Administration of 0.25 mg/kg of DZ had no effect. Response time was increased significantly by 1.0 g/kg of ethanol (EtOH) but was not affected by 0.5 g/kg EtOH. There were no significant effects on the number of correct responses. Combined treatment of 0.5 g/kg of EtOH with 1.0 mg/kg DZ produced the same increase in MRT as the DZ alone. When 1.0 g/kg EtOH was administered with 0.25 mg/kg DZ. MRT decreased which was a significant improvement in performance as compared to the increase in MRT observed with either the EtOH or the DZ alone. Combined doses of 1.0 g/kg EtOH and 0.5 mg/kg DZ produced essentially the same increases in MRT as either dose alone. Similar results were obtained when 1.0 g/kg EtOH and 1.0 mg/kg DZ were combined and the increase in MRT was about the same for DZ alone and more than twice as great for the EtOH alone. Combined administration of the drugs had no significant effects on the number of correct choices. Since the administration of a combination of a low dose of DZ with EtOH appeared to prevent the increases in MRT observed with either drug alone and there were no observable effects on the number of correct response, these effects do not appear to involve cognitive processes but might be related to excitability changes in motor systems.", 
    "83": "The cholinomimetic activities of the antidepressant drug minaprine have been investigated, in vitro and in vivo, in rodents. Minaprine, and its metabolite SR 95070B [3-(2-morpholinoethylamino)-4-methyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl) pyridazine hydrochloride] selectively displaced [3H]-pirenzepine from its cortical and hippocampal binding sites, and only weakly inhibited the binding of [3H]-N-methylscopolamine in either the rat cerebellum, heart and salivary glands, or the guinea-pig ileum. In mice, none of these drugs induced the typical cholinergic side-effects up to lethal doses. Minaprine and SR 95070B antagonized rotations induced by an intrastriatal injection of pirenzepine in mice, after intraperitoneal and/or oral administration. Minaprine also antagonized atropine-induced mydriasis in mice. Both minaprine and SR 95070B potentiated the tremorigenic effect of oxotremorine without inducing tremor when injected alone. Finally, minaprine and SR 95070B, after parenteral and/or oral injection, antagonized the scopolamine-induced deficit in passive avoidance learning, and enhanced short-term retention in the social memory test, in rats. The muscarinic agonists arecoline, oxotremorine and RS 86 [2-ethyl-8-methyl-2,8 diazaspiro-4,5 decan-1,3 dion hydrobromide], as well as the acetylcholine esterase inhibitors physostigmine and tacrine were active in most of these models. These results indicate that minaprine, and its metabolite SR 95070B, have cholinomimetic activities which could be, at least in part, mediated by their selective affinity for M1 muscarinic receptors. Thus minaprine could represent a potential useful drug for the treatment of senile dementias and cognitive impairments occurring in elderly people.", 
    "84": "This is a case report of benzodiazepine abuse and dependence with tolerance to some (psychomotor sedative) but not all (memory) of the BDZ effects. A withdrawal syndrome which included intensification of paranoid personality traits, was observed.", 
    "85": "A patient with chronic tranquilizers abuse which decided according to the media to consume \"natural and soft products\" is described. The implication of such a decision is discussed and a pharmacological approach in such situation is suggested."
