The present study investigated whether a similar phenomenon occurs with benzodiazepines in a different model of anxiety that involves exposing rats to the odor of a predator.", 
    "1": "Testing took place in a rectangular arena containing a cat odor-exuding collar at one end and a small \"hide box\" at the opposite end. Rats were initially familiarized with the odor-free apparatus for 20 min and then placed back in the apparatus 24 and 48 h later in the presence of cat odor.", 
    "2": "Vehicle-treated rats displayed marked avoidance of the cat odor on both first and second exposures, spending most of the session in the hide box and very little time near the odor source. In contrast, rats given a low dose of midazolam (0.375 mg/kg) during first exposure spent considerable time in close proximity to the odor source and much less time in the hide box. Rats given midazolam (0. 375 mg/kg) on their second exposure to cat odor displayed no such anxiolytic effect of the drug. Rats given midazolam (0.375 mg/kg) on both exposures showed a potent anxiolytic effect of the drug on each occasion. This pattern of results was replicated with a higher dose of midazolam (0.75 mg/kg). A further experiment showed that rats previously exposed to cat odor showed high levels of hiding in the test environment 24 h later even when the cat odor was no longer present. This conditioned fear was blocked by midazolam (0.75 mg/kg) suggesting that the ineffectiveness of midazolam on second exposure to cat odor is not due to a failure of the drug to affect conditioned fear.", 
    "3": "The ineffectiveness of midazolam in odor-experienced rats parallels the results obtained with benzodiazepines in the elevated plus maze. Such results may help illuminate the comparative lack of efficacy of benzodiazepines in treating certain types of anxiety disorders in humans.",

The effects of naltrexone and/or chlordiazepoxide on the plus maze and the social interaction tests were also evaluated after previous exposure to the respective apparatus.", 
    "7": "Naltrexone dose dependently increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze in chlordiazepoxide-treated (5 mg/kg i.p.) rats exposed for the first time to the apparatus. Similarly, naltrexone (5 mg/kg i.p.) increased the time spent in active social interaction by chlordiazepoxide-treated rats exposed to an unfamiliar arena. In both experiments, naltrexone had no effect when administered alone. When both the plus maze and the social interaction tests were conducted after previous exposure to the respective apparatus, naltrexone did not modify the behavior of chlordiazepoxide- or saline-treated rats.",

Zolpidem, a GABA(A)-benzodiazepine type 1 receptor-selective ligand, was used in a [3H]flunitrazepam competition study. 3a-Hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) potentiation of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding, and GABA potentiation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding were measured in these same animals.",

Acute activity of cumulative doses of ethanol (0.5-2.0 g/kg) and diazepam (0.1-10 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine agonist, was tested alone and after pretreatment with flumazenil (1.0-10 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine antagonist. Chronic effects of ethanol were tested in three groups of rats that received a liquid diet for 10 days. One group received ethanol alone; one group received ethanol and twice-daily injections of flumazenil (10 mg/kg); and one received a dextrin control diet. Acute withdrawal was tested at 12 hr after removal of the liquid diet. Effects of cumulative doses of diazepam (1.0-10 mg/kg) were tested during withdrawal (12 hr) in the ethanol-alone group.", 
    "15": "Acute doses of ethanol produced a small but significant degree of antinociception, which was fully suppressed by flumazenil. Acute doses of diazepam did not produce antinociception. Chronic exposure to ethanol produced antinociception on days 2 through 8. Tolerance developed by day 10, and hyperalgesia was seen 12 hr after removal of ethanol. Administration of diazepam or ethanol during withdrawal reversed the hyperalgesia induced by ethanol withdrawal. However, flumazenil (10-50 mg/kg) failed to reverse the antihyperalgesic effect of either diazepam or ethanol. No antinociception was seen in either the ethanol/flumazenil or dextrin control groups.",

The biphenolic compounds honokiol (H) and magnolol (M), the main components of the Chinese medicinal plant Magnolia officinalis, interact with GABA(A) receptors in rat brain in vitro. We compared the effects of H and M on [3H]muscimol (MUS) and [3H]flunitrazepam (FNM) binding using EDTA/water dialyzed rat brain membranes in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl plus 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 as well as [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) in 200 mM KBr plus 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. H and M had similar enhancing effects on [3H]MUS as well as on [3H]FNM binding to rat brain membrane preparations, but H was 2.5 to 5.2 times more potent than M. 2. [3H]FNM binding. GABA alone almost doubled [3H]FNM binding with EC50 = 450 nM and 200 nM using forebrain and cerebellar membranes, respectively. In the presence of 5 microM H or M the EC50 values for GABA were decreased to 79 and 89 nM, respectively, using forebrain, and 39 and 78 nM, using cerebellar membranes. H and M potently enhanced the potentiating effect of 200 nM GABA on [3H]FNM binding with EC50 values of 0.61 microM and 1.6 microM using forebrain membranes, with maximal enhancements of 33 and 47%, respectively. Using cerebellar membranes, the corresponding values were 0.25 and 1.1 microM, and 22 and 34%. 3. [3H]MUS binding. H and M increased [3H]MUS binding to whole forebrain membranes about 3-fold with EC50 values of 6.0 and 15 microM. Using cerebellar membranes, H and M increased [3H]MUS binding approximately 68% with EC50 values of 2.3 and 12 microM, respectively. Scatchard analysis revealed that the enhancements of [3H]MUS binding were due primarily to increases in the number of binding sites (Bmax values) with no effect on the high affinity binding constants (Kd values). The enhancing effect of H and M were not additive. 4. [35S]TBPS binding. H and M displaced [35S]TBPS binding from sites on whole rat forebrain membranes with IC50 values of 7.8 and 6.0 microM, respectively. Using cerebellar membranes, the corresponding IC50 values were 5.3 and 4.8 microM. These inhibitory effects were reversed by the potent GABA(A) receptor blocker R5135 (10 nM), suggesting that H and M allosterically increase the affinity of GABA(A) receptors for GABA and MUS by binding to sites in GABA(A) receptor complexes. 5. Two monophenols, the anesthetic propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol, P) and the anti-inflammatory diflunisal (2',4'-difluoro-4-hydroxy-3-biphenyl carboxylic acid, D) also enhanced [3H]MUS binding, decreased the EC50 values for GABA in enhancing [3H]FNM binding and potentiated the enhancing effect of 200 nM GABA on [3H]FNM binding, although enhancements of [3H]MUS binding for these monophenols were smaller than those for H and M, using forebrain and cerebellar membranes. The enhancing effect of P and D on [3H]MUS binding were almost completely additive. 2,2'-biphenol was inactive on [3H]MUS and [3H]FNM binding. These, and other preliminary experiments, suggest that appropriate ortho (C2) and para (C4) substitution increases the GABA-potentiating activity of phenols. 6. The potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission by H and M is probably involved in their previously reported anxiolytic and central depressant effects.", 
    "18": "Liver disease can modify the kinetics of drugs biotransformed by the liver. This review updates recent developments in this field, with particular emphasis on cytochrome P450 (CYP). CYP is a rapidly expanding area in clinical pharmacology. The information currently available on specific isoforms involved in drug metabolism has increased tremendously over the latest years, but knowledge remains incomplete. Studies on the effects of liver disease on specific isoenzymes of CYP have shown that some isoforms are more susceptible than others to liver disease. A detailed knowledge of the particular isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of a drug and the impact of liver disease on that enzyme can provide a rational basis for dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. The capacity of the liver to metabolise drugs depends on hepatic blood flow and liver enzyme activity, both of which can be affected by liver disease. In addition, liver failure can influence the binding of a drug to plasma proteins. These changes can occur alone or in combination; when they coexist their effect on drug kinetics is synergistic, not simply additive. The kinetics of drugs with a low hepatic extraction are sensitive to hepatic failure rather than to liver blood flow changes, but drugs having a significant first-pass effect are sensitive to alterations in hepatic blood flow. The drugs examined in this review are: cardiovascular agents (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium antagonists, ketanserin, antiarrhythmics and hypolipidaemics), diuretics (torasemide), psychoactive and anticonvulsant agents (benzodiazepines, flumazenil, antidepressants and tiagabine), antiemetics (metoclopramide and serotonin antagonists), antiulcers (acid pump inhibitors), anti-infectives and antiretroviral agents (grepafloxacin, ornidazole, pefloxacin, stavudine and zidovudine), immunosuppressants (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), naltrexone, tolcapone and toremifene. According to the available data, the kinetics of many drugs are altered by liver disease to an extent that requires dosage adjustment; the problem is to quantify the required changes. Obviously, this requires the evaluation of the degree of hepatic impairment. At present there is no satisfactory test that gives a quantitative measure of liver function and its impairment. A critical evaluation of these methods is provided. Guidelines providing a rational basis for dosage adjustment are illustrated. Finally, it is important to consider that liver disease not only affects pharmacokinetics but also pharmacodynamics. This review also examines drugs with altered pharmacodynamics.",

    "21": "Generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia account for most cases of anxiety disorder in late life. Late-onset generalized anxiety is usually associated with depressive illness and, in this situation, the primary pharmacologic treatment is antidepressant medication. Most elderly people with agoraphobia do not give a history of panic attacks; exposure therapy is the preferred treatment for agoraphobia without panic.",

    "23": "Antipsychotic dosing for acute mania has not been well studied. Combined treatment with lithium and an antipsychotic is the most common treatment, but additional antimanic efficacy of a lithium-antipsychotic combination beyond that of an antipsychotic alone has not been well demonstrated. Furthermore, the possibility that lithium could affect antipsychotic dose requirement is believed to have never been studied. In this study, 63 acutely psychotic bipolar manic inpatients were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with 1 of 2 haloperidol doses, 25 mg/day or 5 mg/day, for 21 days. In addition to haloperidol, subjects were randomly assigned to receive concomitant treatment with placebo, standard lithium, or lorazepam 4 mg/day. The high haloperidol dose produced greater improvement and more side effects than did the low dose. Lithium added to the low dose produced a markedly greater clinical response than did the low dose alone. Lorazepam did not improve the outcome for the patients receiving low-dose haloperidol. The clinical response produced by high-dose haloperidol was not enhanced by adding either lithium or lorazepam. All treatment effects emerged by the fourth day of treatment and persisted. Used alone, a haloperidol dose of 5 mg/day is too low for most manic patients, but concomitant lithium produces a dose-dependent enhancement of haloperidol response. Lorazepam 4 mg/day was insufficient to produce an advantage when added to low-dose haloperidol.", 
    "24": "Despite decades of relevant basic and clinical research, active debate continues about the appropriate extent and duration of benzodiazepine use in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. The primary basis of the controversy seems to be concern among clinicians, regulators, and the public about the dependence potential and the abuse liability of benzodiazepines. This article reports systematically elicited judgments on these issues by a representative panel of 73 internationally recognized experts in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depressive disorders, a panel which was constituted by a multistage process of peer nomination. The criterion for inclusion at each stage was the nomination by at least two peers as one of the \"professionally most respected physicians of the world with extensive experience and knowledge in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depressive disorders.\" Sixty-six respondents (90%) completed a comprehensive questionnaire covering a wide range of topics relevant to the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines and other medications that might be used for the same purposes. Overall, the expert panel judged that benzodiazepines pose a higher risk of dependence and abuse than most potential substitutes but a lower risk than older sedatives and recognized drugs of abuse. There was little consensus about the relative risk of dependence and abuse among the benzodiazepines. Differences between benzodiazepines with shorter and longer half-lives in inducing withdrawal symptoms are much less clear during tapered than during abrupt discontinuation. There was little agreement about the most important factors contributing to withdrawal symptoms and failure to discontinue benzodiazepines. The pharmacologic properties of the medication may be the most important contributors to withdrawal symptoms. In contrast, the clinical characteristics of the patient may be the most important contributors to failure to discontinue medication. The experts' judgment seems to support the widespread use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of bona fide anxiety disorders, even over long periods. The experts generally viewed dependence and abuse liability as clinical issues amenable to appropriate management, as for other adverse events related to therapy. However, more definitive clinical research on the remaining controversial issues is urgently needed to promote optimal patient care.", 
    "25": "Successful discontinuation of therapeutic drugs requires patients to negotiate two potentially difficult phases. First, they must complete the drug discontinuation procedure itself, which may entail coping with rebound and withdrawal symptoms as well as anxiety due to stopping a treatment on which they depend psychologically. Second, they must maintain drug abstinence over time, despite possible exacerbations or recurrences of the disorder that the drug was treating. For optimal success, interventions aimed at assisting patients to discontinue drug use must address both of those tasks. Patients' ability to discontinue benzodiazepines seems to be strongly influenced by cognitive appraisals of the threat represented by symptoms and of their own competence to cope with it without medication. For problems of that kind, cognitive and behavioral techniques such as those developed for the treatment of panic disorder may be especially well-suited. Currently, the most successful approaches to benzodiazepine discontinuation include the following components: (1) assisting with initial drug discontinuation, educating patients about benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal, and about the kinds of symptoms that can emerge as the drug dose is decreased, combined with a flexible drug taper conducted in supportive collaboration with the patient; and (2) dealing with exacerbations of the illness, and providing disorder-specific cognitive-behavioral treatment as an alternative to the resumption of pharmacotherapy. It seems to be crucial that the drug taper be completed before psychological treatment concludes.", 
    "26": "Benzodiazepines have been shown to have broad-spectrum activity, rapid onset of action, and a wide therapeutic window compared with other anxiolytic medications. Yet the use of benzodiazepines has been limited by concern regarding dependence, withdrawal, and abuse. Agents such as antidepressants, serotonergic anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, and beta-blockers have been used with varying degrees of success to help facilitate the tapering of benzodiazepines. Carbamazepine, imipramine, valproate, and trazodone have been beneficial in the management of benzodiazepine discontinuation, but not in decreasing the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal. A stepwise approach to discontinuing benzodiazepines is offered.", 
    "27": "Benzodiazepines have been used to treat a wide variety of disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, sleep disorders, somatopsychic disorders, and depression. Concerns regarding physiologic dependence, withdrawal, and abuse potential with benzodiazepines prompted the development of strict guidelines for the use of these agents. Studies have shown that the risk of physiologic dependence increases with factors such as the dose of the benzodiazepine used and the duration of treatment. Restrictions involving benzodiazepines have led to the substitution of alternative medicines that may have decreased efficacy and greater safety concerns. There is a need for a more balanced assessment of the benefits and risks associated with benzodiazepine use to ensure that patients who would truly benefit from these agents are not denied appropriate treatment.", 
    "28": "The imidazobenzodiazepines ethyl 8-iodo-5,6 dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate 1 and tert-butyl 8-iodo-5,6 dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate 2 were prepared to study the diazepam-insensitive (DI) benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) subtype. The [123I] analogues were prepared via iododestannylation reactions in radiochemical yields of 70-80% and a specific activity >2,500 Ci/mmol. The tert-butyl analogue [123I]-2 exhibited nanomolar affinity for BZRs in homogenate membranes of rat cerebellum with Kd values for the diazepam-sensitive (DS) and DI receptors of 3.18 +/- 0.58 and 13.55 +/- 2.72 nM, respectively. The Bmax for cerebellar DS and DI receptors were 1,276 +/- 195 and 518 +/- 26 fmol/mg protein, respectively.", 
    "29": "In order to further clarify the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in spinal sensory processing we have studied the effects of baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, and midazolam, a benzodiazepine agonist, on the activation of spinal neurones by peripheral innocuous or noxious stimulation, in normal or monoarthritic rats, as signalled by the induction of the proto-oncogene c-fos. Baclofen (10 mg/kg, i.v.) caused a significant reduction in the number of Fos-positive neurones following noxious stimulation of both normal and monoarthritic animals, which was prevented by the GABA(B) antagonist CGP 35348 (200 mg/kg, i.v.). The latter caused an increase of c-fos expression in normal animals subject to noxious stimulation, suggesting an endogenous tonic activation of GABA(B) receptors. This effect was not observed in monoarthritic animals. Baclofen also reduced the number of Fos-positive neurones in monoarthritic animals subject to innocuous stimulation. Midazolam (5 mg/kg, i.v.) had no effect in normal animals, but caused an increase in c-fos expression induced by noxious stimulation in monoarthritic animals. Flumazenil (1 mg/kg, i.v.), a benzodiazepine antagonist, prevented the effect of midazolam, and if given alone evoked a decrease in Fos-positive neurones. It can be concluded that although GABA(B) receptors modulate sensory input at the spinal level, high doses of systemic baclofen are required to inhibit nociceptive-induced c-fos expression. The paradoxical facilitation of c-fos expression by midazolam in monoarthritic animals, may be due to the reported increase in spinal GABA levels found in those animals.", 
    "30": "Given the prominent role of CYP3A in the metabolism of drugs, it is important to identify whether new chemical entities will affect this enzyme system and produce clinically relevant drug interactions. This study evaluated concomitant administration of intravenous [14C N-methyl] erythromycin (3 microCi) (erythromycin breath test; EBT) and 2 mg oral midazolam as probes of systemic and of systemic plus presystemic CYP3A activity, respectively. Twelve males received the probes in a two-period crossover fashion: one period included the probes on two occasions, 5 days apart; in the second period, 200 mg ketoconazole was given orally 2 hours prior to the probes. The within-subject CV for EBT (%14CO2/h) and midazolam AUC0-last was 4.9% and 16.9%, respectively. Ketoconazole reduced %14CO2/h by 43% and increased midazolam AUC0-last by approximately fivefold. In a nonrandomized third period (N = 5), ketoconazole was given simultaneously with midazolam (no EBT); midazolam AUC0-last was similar whether ketoconazole was given 2 hours prior to or simultaneously with the midazolam. The low midazolam dose was generally well tolerated; mild sedation was occasionally seen. Concurrent administration of the EBT and oral midazolam is a sensitive and reproducible tool to screen new chemical entities for potentially important CYP3A interactions.", 
    "31": "O(6)-Alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase) is an important modulator of alkylating agent-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity, but those factors which influence the expression of this repair protein in human tissues are poorly characterised. In this study, we have determined ATase levels in macroscopically normal and tumour tissues from 76 individuals with benign or malignant colorectal disease. All tissue samples had detectable ATase activity, with values ranging from 35 to 451 fmol/mg protein. ATase activity in normal rectal tissue was significantly higher than that in normal tissue from the sigmoid colon (148 +/- 76 vs. 100 +/- 40 fmol/mg protein, p = 0.01), whereas ATase levels within different regions of the colon (proximal vs. sigmoid colon) were similar. In normal tissue, inter-individual variation in ATase activity was 4-fold in the colon and 6-fold in the rectum, whereas in tumour tissue the corresponding figures were approx. 13.0- and 7-fold, respectively. There was no detectable difference in normal tissue ATase activity between individuals with benign or malignant disease of the colon. Normal and tumour tissue ATase activities were strongly correlated in the sigmoid colon (r = 0.80) and rectum (r = 0.59) but not the caecum (r = -0.03). In a multivariate analysis, ATase activity in normal colon tissue increased with age (p = 0.01) and current smoking (p = 0.06), whereas tumour ATase activity increased only with use of anti-histamines (p = 0.05). In rectal tumour tissue, activity decreased with age (p = 0.05) and use of anti-muscarinic medications (p = 0.01): in normal rectal tissue, no modulating factors were identified.", 
    "32": "Substantial empirical evidence exists suggesting that there are distinct forms of explicit and implicit memory. However, methodological problems have hampered attempts to identify the nature of the information processing underlying these forms of memory. These problems include the contamination of performance on implicit memory tests by explicit memory processes, as well as a host of difficulties inherent in correlational approaches that involve amnesiac subjects. In this paper we attempt to explore whether midazolam, a benzodiazepine used in surgical anesthesia, might be useful for studying implicit memory. Specifically, we attempt to determine whether midazolam produces selective effects on explicit, as opposed to implicit, memory. We focus on midazolam because of prior studies demonstrating that benzodiazepines do not affect implicit memory and because its rapid pharmacokinetics ensure that sedative effects are minimized when testing occurs at relatively short retention intervals. The results of an experiment using free recall, fragment completion and perceptual identification tests suggest that midazolam diminishes memory in implicit and explicit memory tests, although the diminution is proportionally larger in explicit memory. These results constrain the inferences that may be drawn when midazolam is used to explore implicit memory.", 
    "33": "Previous studies have suggested that clozapine is associated with increases in both weight and serum triglyceride (but not cholesterol) levels. Because of the pharmacologic similarities between clozapine and olanzapine, we decided to evaluate if olanzapine use was associated with an increase in triglycerides.",

Both increases were significant at p < .05. Fasting total cholesterol did not increase. The triglyceride increase was even larger when we excluded 8 patients who received various interventions to lower lipid levels (e.g., pravastatin, low-fat diet) during the olanzapine trial. There was a strong association between weight change and triglyceride change (p < .02); after controlling for weight, analysis of covariance showed no independent increase in triglycerides.",

    "37": "Clozapine is the current treatment of choice for drug-induced psychosis (DIP) occurring in Parkinson's disease. However, alternative medications have been sought because of the small but significant risk of agranulocytosis and the need for frequent blood testing. The new \"atypical\" antipsychotic olanzapine (OLZ) has recently been proposed as a safe and effective option for treating psychosis in this setting. To investigate this, we retrospectively evaluated all 12 of our patients treated with OLZ for DIP. Symptoms of psychosis were improved in nine of 12 patients, but nine of 12 patients also experienced worsening of motor functioning while on OLZ. The worsening was considered dramatic in six of these patients. Overall, there was no significant increase in levodopa doses on OLZ. Only one patient remained on OLZ at the time of the analysis. Nine patients were switched to alternative treatment for DIP. We conclude that although OLZ may improve symptoms of psychosis in parkinsonian patients, it can also worsen motor functioning. In some patients, the degree of motor worsening may be intolerable.",

Forty children received epidural analgesia after open-heart surgery. Lidocaine was injected in a dose of 1.5-2 mg/kg every 1.5-2 h. Controls (16 pts) received intravenous fentanyl + diazepam analgesia. Respiratory response and awakening were significantly earlier (p < 0.001) in the epidural group. Cooperation with nurses was much better in this group, too. No side effects were observed in the epidural group. Therefore, thoracic epidural analgesia is a safe and effective method of postoperative analgesia for children subjected to open-heart surgery.", 
    "39": "Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) have been applied in order to explain the structural requirements of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) inhibitory activity of TIBO derivatives on the MT-4 cells. The best QSAR model is satisfactory in both statistical significance and predictive ability. The derived structural descriptors indicate the importance of electronic contributions toward the HIV-1 RT inhibition of this class of compounds. However, it could not reveal any hydrophobic influence because of high collinearity between C2 and log P variables. In order to cope with steric interaction in the correlation, 3D-QSAR was performed using CoMFA. The obtained CoMFA model shows high predictive ability, rcv2 = 0.771, and clearly demonstrates its potential in the steric feature of the molecules through contour maps, explaining a majority (81.8%) of the variance in the data. Consequently, these results can be useful in identifying the structural requirements of TIBO derivatives and helpful for better understanding the HIV-1 RT inhibition. Eventually, they provide a beneficial basis to design new and more potent inhibitors of HIV-1 RT.", 
    "40": "The complex interrelations between the nervous system and the immune system have led to the creation of a new research area denoted neuroimmunology. The effects of stress on the immune response have long been observed in chickens. Since benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the stress reaction, we proposed to assess the importance of these receptors in the activity of chick peritoneal macrophages. We used 420 viable embryonated eggs of the commercial Hubbard broiler line treated through the chorioallantoid membrane on the 11th day of incubation: falsely manipulated (Sham group), with 40% propyleneglycol (PG) in simple Ringer solution (Vehicle group), and treated with diazepam (DZ), 8 mg/kg (DZ group). After hatching, the chicks were housed in metal rearing cages of the \"battery\" type for 5 weeks. At 36 days of age, 24 chicks from each treated group were divided at random into two groups of 12 animals each which were treated with DZ (2 mg/kg) or with 40% PPG in an equal volume once a day by the oral route for 4 days. Peritoneal macrophages were collected and submitted to the spreading an phagocytosis tests. Data were analyzed statistically using the SAS software (p < 0.05). Administration of DZ in ovo did not cause a significant decrease in egg hatchability, birth weight or performance parameters during the 5 weeks of assessment. However, the rate of macrophage spreading and phagocytosis was reduced. When administered at 40 days of age, DZ did not change the spreading rate but reduced the phagocytosis rate. There was no interaction between treatments. These results indicate that benzodiazepine receptors seem to be important for macrophage activity also in birds, as previously observed in rodents and primates. Since benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the response to stress, it is possible that the effects of stress on avian immunity may be mediated in part by these receptors.",

Using survival analysis, retention rates between the placebo-controlled trials (PCTs) and the nonplacebo-controlled trials (NPCTs) were compared. Screening and percentage improvement on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores were compared.",

    "45": "Haloperidol augmented a trend of an increase in the heat shock protein (hsp70) mRNA levels induced by phencyclidine (PCP) in rat medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum, while the atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone decreased it. When administered alone, clozapine, but not haloperidol, decreased hsp70 mRNA levels. Haloperidol and the atypical antipsychotic drugs may thus have differential effects on hsp70 expression in some brain regions of PCP-treated rats.", 
    "46": "The reports of interactions between benzodiazepines (BZPs) and other drugs (e.g., antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiulcer drugs, antiepileptic drugs, macrolide antibiotics) during their combined use are reviewed. In general, metabolism of BZPs is delayed when combined with a number of other drugs but some reports have suggested otherwise. In recent years, the cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) isoenzyme that catalyses the metabolism of BZPs has also been identified. BZPs are mainly catalysed by CYP3A4. When published reports are studied, it appears necessary to be exceptionally careful about interactions mainly between BZPs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cimetidine, antiepileptic drugs, macrolide antibiotics and antimycotics. More information is necessary to identify individuals at greatest risk of drug interactions and adverse events.", 
    "47": "Different normo- and pathophysiological conditions are associated with large variations in plasma and brain concentrations of neuroactive steroids. In an attempt to specify the possible role of these steroids in memory processes, we examined the ability of pregnanolone, a positive modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex, to sustain state dependence in rats. Animals treated with either saline or different doses of pregnanolone were trained to complete a fixed ratio 10 (FR10) schedule of lever presses for milk reward within 120 s, and were tested for the retention of this response 48 h later while treated with the same or a different treatment. The data indicate that saline-to-drug as well as drug-to-saline state changes produced robust failures to recall the response. Furthermore, animals trained with pregnanolone showed transfer of the response when tested with the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide and vice versa. The partial benzodiazepine inverse agonist N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142) antagonized the states produced by both pregnanolone and chlordiazepoxide. State changes constitute a mechanism of action that may operate endogenously; the release of neuroactive steroids in response to various physiological conditions may act to contain but also to constrain memories associated with these events, rendering these memories inaccessible on other occasions. The apparent memory impairment that can so be produced may render the effects of past experience available in a manner that is appropriately selective.", 
    "48": "Studies in slices suggest that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated synaptic currents are not present in CA1 (Cornu ammonis) pyramidal neurons at birth (P0). We have re-examined this issue in the rat intact hippocampal formation (IHF) in vitro. Injections of biocytin or carbocyanine show that the temporo-ammonic, commissural and Schaffer collateral pathways are present at birth in the marginal zone of CA1. Electrical stimulation of these pathways evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the marginal zone of CA1 from embryonic day 19 (E19) to postnatal day 9 (P9). These fEPSPs are mediated by synaptic AMPA receptors as they are reduced or completely blocked by: (i) tetrodotoxin; (ii) high divalent cation concentrations; (iii) the adenosine A1 receptor agonist CPA; (iv) anoxic episodes; (v) the selective AMPA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI-53655) or the mixed AMPA-kainate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX). The amplitude of the fEPSPs is also reduced by D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV) and its duration is increased by bicuculline suggesting the participation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. Finally, AMPA receptor-mediated fEPSPs are also recorded in P0 slices, but they are smaller and more labile than in the IHF. Our results suggest that in embryonic CA1 neurons, glutamate acting on AMPA receptors already provides a substantial part of the excitatory drive and may play an important role in the activity-dependent development of the hippocampus. Furthermore, the IHF may be a convenient preparation to investigate the properties of the developing hippocampus.", 
    "49": "The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the requirement of sufentanil is reduced in elderly patients when the opiate is primarily used to facilitate mechanical ventilation in a medical intensive care unit. A further aim was to study whether elderly patients developed withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing prolonged sufentanil administration. We have studied prospectively two groups of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 96 h; group 1 age < 60 years (n = 316 or 68%) and group 2 age > 70 years (n = 150 or 32%). In all patients sufentanil and midazolam were administered continuously in order to facilitate ventilatory support. After an initial intravenous bolus injection of sufentanil 3.0-8.0 micrograms kg-1, the dosage was adjusted to the patients needs (0.75-1.0 microgram-1 kg-1 h) using a modified Ramsey score by accepting between 3b and 4a as the end point. The amount of sufentanil administered and side effects were recorded at 24-h intervals. Seventy-two hours following the start of sedation with sufentanil/midazolam the dose of sufentanil required for sedation increased significantly (P < 0.05) in both groups when compared with the first 24 h. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in sufentanil requirement at any time during the study. This suggests that tachyphylaxis develops to a similar degree in patients in both age groups. In addition, weaning in the elderly was characterized by a similar degree of withdrawal-like symptoms suggesting that independent of age, there are similar receptor related reactions once the opiate is withdrawn.",

In AD, whereas the CBF was diminished in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortex, the distribution volume of FMZ and delayed activity of IMZ were relatively preserved in these cortices, suggesting that the BZR reduction, reflecting neuronal loss, is less prominent than the CBF suppression. The mini-mental state examination score (MMS) was weakly correlated with the CBF in the parietal cortex but not with BZR. It is speculated that the neuronal density reflected by BZR is less impaired than the neuronal function assessed with blood flow in the association cortex of AD. High correlation was found between the uptake of FMZ and the delayed activity of IMZ. The delayed image of IMZ-SPECT is clinically useful to evaluate the preservation of neuronal density in the affected temoporoparietal association cortex in AD.",

Vagotomy abolished the latter response, suggesting a centrally elicited nervous action of bicuculline mediated by the vagal nerves. This was supported by the absence of an effect of bicuculline administered intra-arterially close to the duodenum. The GABA(A) agonist muscimol had no effect on DBS when administered intravenously (0.01-0.25 mg/kg) or into a lateral brain ventricle (2 microg/kg/h) but counteracted any stimulation by subsequent intravenous bicuculline. The 'peripheral-type' BZ agonist 4'-chlorodiazepam increased DBS when infused close intra-arterially but had no effect when administered intravenously.",

    "59": "Dopamine receptor activation regulates cyclic AMP levels and is critically involved in modulating neurotransmission in the striatum. Others have shown that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor-mediated current is potentiated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activation. We made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from cultured striatal neurons and tested whether D1-type dopamine receptor activation affected AMPA receptor-mediated currents. After a 5-min exposure to the D1 agonist SKF 81297 (1 microM), kainate-evoked current amplitude was enhanced in approximately 75% of cells to 121+/-2.5% of that recorded prior to addition of drug. This response was inhibited by the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 and mimicked by activators of PKA. Moreover, by western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated PKA site Ser845 of GluR1, we observed a marked increase in phosphorylated GluR1 following a 10-min exposure of striatal neurons to 1 microM SKF 81297. Our data demonstrate that activation of D1-type dopamine receptors on striatal neurons promotes phosphorylation of AMPA receptors by PKA as well as potentiation of current amplitude. These results elucidate one mechanism by which dopamine can modulate neurotransmission in the striatum.", 
    "60": "EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport concentrates glutamate across plasma membranes of brain neurons and epithelia. In brain, EAAC1 provides a presynaptic uptake mechanism to terminate the excitatory action of released glutamate and to keep its extracellular concentration below toxic levels. Here we report the effect of well known anxiolytic compounds, benzodiazepines, on glutamate transport in EAAC1-stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in EAAC1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. Functional properties of EAAC1 agreed well with already reported characteristics of the neuronal high-affinity glutamate transporter (Km D-Asp,CHO cells: 2.23+/-0.15 microM; Km D-Asp,oocytes: 17.01+/-3.42 microM). In both expression systems, low drug concentrations (10-100 microM) activated substrate uptake (up to 200% of control), whereas concentrations in the millimolar range inhibited (up to 50%). Furthermore, the activation was more pronounced at low substrate concentrations (1 microM), and the inhibition was attenuated. The activity of other sodium cotransporters such as the sodium/D-glucose cotransporter SGLT1, stably transfected in CHO cells, was not affected by benzodiazepines. In electrophysiological studies, these drugs also failed to change the membrane potential of EAAC1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. These results suggest a direct action on the glutamate transporter itself without modifying the general driving forces. Thus, in vivo low concentrations of benzodiazepines may reduce synaptic glutamate concentrations by increased uptake, providing an additional mechanism to modulate neuronal excitability.", 
    "61": "Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in 60 male or female, anxious or anxiety-free university students, before and after separated or simultaneous intake of alprazolam and exposure to noise. A significant increase of the latencies of the ABRs was found when subjects took alprazolam. This effect is consistent with the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), one of the neurotransmitters at terminals of cochlear efferent fibres A significant increase of the latencies was observed after noise alone. In subjects taking alprazolam when they are exposed to noise, the effect of noise on the ABR latencies is reduced, but not abolished. The effects of alprazolam on the ABR are consistent with the presence of GABA in the medulla and pons. Significant effects of noise upon III-V and I-V intervals suggest that auditory 'fatigue' may involve a retrocochlear component. Differences due to sex appear to be abolished by anxiety.", 
    "62": "1. The authors investigated the effect of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil on freezing behavior induced by conditioned fear stress and used a time-sampling procedure. 2. Rats were individually subjected to 5 min of inescapable electric footshock in a shock chamber. Twenty-four hours after the footshock, the rats were again placed in the shock chamber and observed for 5 min without shocks: this procedure is termed conditioned fear stress. 3. Subcutaneous administration of flumazenil (10 mg/kg) 30 min before conditioned fear stress reduced conditioned freezing, while flumazenil (1-10 mg/kg) 30 min before footshock did not. This indicates that flumazenil reduced the expression of conditioned fear, suggesting an anxiolytic effect of flumazenil. 4. This effect may be attributable to antagonism by flumazenil to endogenous inverse agonist-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors. It is suggested that endogenous inverse agonist-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the expression of conditioned fear stress.", 
    "63": "1. Ionic current responses elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) in follicle-enclosed Xenopus oocytes (follicles) were studied using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. ACh generated a fast chloride current (Fin) and inhibited K+ currents gated by cAMP (IK,cAMP) following receptor activation by adenosine, follicle-stimulating hormone or noradrenaline. These previously described cholinergic responses were confirmed to be of the muscarinic type, and were independently generated among follicles from different frogs. 2. Inhibition of IK,cAMP was about 100 times more sensitive to ACh than Fin activation; the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were 6.6 +/- 0.4 and 784 +/- 4 nM, respectively. 3. Both responses were blocked by several muscarinic receptor antagonists. Using the respective EC50 concentrations of ACh as standard, the antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide blocked the two effects with very different potencies. Fin was blocked with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.4 +/- 0.07 nM, whilst the IC50 for IK,cAMP inhibition was 5.9 +/- 0.2 microM. 4. Oxotremorine, a muscarinic agonist, preferentially stimulated IK, cAMP inhibition (EC50 = 15.8 +/- 1.4 microM), whilst Fin was only weakly activated. In contrast, oxotremorine inhibited Fin generated by ACh with an IC50 of 2.3 +/- 0.7 microM. 5. Fin elicited via purinergic receptor stimulation was not affected by oxotremorine, indicating that the inhibition produced was specific to the muscarinic receptor, and suggesting that muscarinic actions do not exert a strong effect on follicular cell-oocyte coupling. 6. Using reverse transcription-PCR, transcripts of a previously cloned muscarinic receptor from Xenopus (XlmR) were amplified from the RNA of both the isolated follicular cells and the oocyte. The pharmacological and molecular characteristics suggest that XlmR is involved in IK,cAMP inhibition. 7. In conclusion, follicular cells possess two different muscarinic receptors, one resembling the M2 (or M4) subtype and the other the M3 subtype. These receptors are coupled to distinct membrane mechanisms leading to independent regulation of two membrane conductances.", 
    "64": "In this review, both cationic and neutral synthetic ligands that bind in the minor groove of DNA are discussed. Certain bis-distamycins and related lexitropsins show activities against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 at low nanomolar concentrations. DAPI binds strongly to AT-containing polymers and is located in the minor groove of DNA. DAPI intercalates in DNA sequences that do not contain at least three consecutive AT bp. Berenil can also exhibit intercalative, as well as minor groove binding, properties depending on sequence. Furan-containing analogues of berenil play an important role in their activities against Pneumocystis carinii and Cryptosporidium parvuam infections in vivo. Pt(II)-berenil conjugates show a good activity profile against HL60 and U-937 human leukemic cells. Pt-pentamidine shows higher antiproliferative activity against small cell lung, non-small cell lung, and melanoma cancer cell lines compared with many other tumor cell lines. trans-Butenamidine shows good anti-P. carinii activity in rats. Pentamidine is used against P. carinii pneumonia in individuals infected with HIV who are at high risk from this infection. A comparison of the cytotoxic potencies of adozelesin, bizelesin, carzelesin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin indicates that adozelesin is a potent analog of CC-1065. Naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,1-c][l,4]benzodiazepines such as anthramycin have a 2- to 3-bp sequence specificity, but a synthetic PBD dimer spans 6 bp, actively recognizing a central 5'-GATC sequence. The crosslinking efficiency of PBD dimers is much greater than that of other major groove crosslinkers, such as cisplatin, melphalan, etc. Neothramycin is used clinically for the treatment of superficial carcinoma of the bladder.", 
    "65": "Amacrine cells that respond transiently to maintained illumination are thought to mediate transient inhibitory input to ganglion cells. The excitation of these transient amacrine cells is thought to be limited by inhibitory feedback to bipolar cells. We investigated the possibility that desensitizing AMPA and/or kainate (KA) receptors on amacrine cells might also limit the duration of amacrine cell excitation. To determine how these receptors might affect amacrine cell input and output, we made whole-cell recordings from amacrine and ganglion cells in the salamander retinal slice. The specific AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-53655 blocked non-NMDA receptor-mediated amacrine cell excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and kainate puff-elicited currents, indicating that AMPA, and not KA, receptors mediated the responses. Cyclothiazide, an agent that reduces AMPA receptor desensitization, increased the amplitude and duration of amacrine cell EPSCs. To measure the output of transient amacrine cells, we recorded glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from ganglion cells, and found that these were also enhanced by cyclothiazide. Thus, prolongation of amacrine cell AMPA receptor activation enhanced amacrine cell output. Current responses elicited by puffing glycine onto ganglion cell dendrites were not affected by cyclothiazide, indicating that the enhancement of glycinergic IPSCs was not due to a direct effect on glycine receptors. These data suggest that rapid AMPA receptor desensitization and/or deactivation limits glycinergic amacrine cell excitation and the resulting inhibitory synaptic output.",

Ro 15-3505 also improved ambulatory activity and neurological score; however, the improvement was less evident at higher doses. Combination treatment was not superior to single treatment. Survival was increased in treatment-responder rats.",

    "70": "Furosemide increases the basal tert-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding and reverses the inhibition of the binding by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cerebellar GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha6 and beta2/beta3 subunits. These effects are less pronounced in the alcohol-sensitive (ANT) than in the alcohol-insensitive (AT) rat line. The difference between the rat lines in the increase of basal [35S]TBPS binding was removed after a longer preincubation with ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing buffer, but long preincubation did not reduce the GABA content of the incubation fluid or remove the difference in GABA antagonism by furosemide. The GABA sensitivity of the [35S]TBPS binding did not differ between the rat lines. There was no nucleotide sequence difference in the beta2 or beta3 subunits between the rat lines and similar beta2/3 subunit-dependent agonistic actions by methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) in the rat lines were detected. The data suggest that there are still unknown structural alterations in the cerebellar GABA(A) receptors between the AT and ANT rat lines, possibly associated with differential alcohol sensitivity.", 
    "71": "Influences of diazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, on the contractile response to calcium in skinned trabecular fibers of guinea pig heart were examined. Diazepam (100 microM) enhanced the contractile response of the skinned fiber to calcium and shifted the concentration-response curve to the left. The pCa50 values were 6.07+/-0.03 and 6.28+/-0.03 (P<0.05) in the absence and presence of diazepam, respectively. This result suggests that diazepam increases calcium sensitivity of contractile proteins in heart muscles.", 
    "72": "Recent research has demonstrated that the receptor for glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter, may play an important role in the expression of benzodiazepine withdrawal signs. This proposal is based on various observations. For example, antagonists for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors can suppress the behavioral signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal in mice and rats. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor in the cerebrocortical area of diazepam-withdrawn rats is upregulated. Finally, the stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis mediated by mGluR is enhanced in cerebrocortical slices from lorazepam-withdrawn mice. These findings show that the upregulation of signal transduction mediated by glutamate receptors during diazepam withdrawal plays a role in the neuroadaptive response responsible for the expression of diazepam withdrawal signs. Furthermore, ligands for glutamate receptors may be suitable targets for treating benzodiazepine withdrawal signs.", 
    "73": "It has been widely reported that the anxiolytic efficacy of benzodiazepines in the elevated plus-maze test is abolished in subjects (rats or mice) that have been given a single prior undrugged experience of the test apparatus. The present series of experiments was designed to further characterise the key experiential determinants of this intriguing phenomenon in Swiss Webster mice. Using a standard 5 min test duration for both trials, Experiment 1 confirmed the anxiolytic efficacy of chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 5-20 mg/kg) in mice naive to the plus-maze, but a virtual elimination of drug effects in animals that had been pre-exposed to the maze 24 h earlier. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that, while extending the duration of initial exposure to 10 min did not prevent the loss of CDP (10 mg/kg) efficacy in a standard-duration second trial, increasing the duration of both trials reinstated an anxiolytic profile for the compound. Finally, although trial 1 confinement to an open arm did not compromise CDP efficacy when animals were subsequently allowed to freely explore the maze (Experiment 4), closed arm confinement during initial exposure abolished the drug's anxiolytic action upon retest (Experiment 5). In contrast to previous findings in rats, these data suggest that the experientially induced loss of benzodiazepine efficacy in the mouse plus-maze depends rather critically upon prior discovery and exploration of relatively safe areas of the maze (i.e. closed arms). Results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that the absence of an anxiolytic response to benzodiazepines in plus-maze-experienced subjects reflects the acquisition of an open arm phobia during trial 1.",

Both are condensates of one mole each of anthranilic acid, phenylalanine, and glutamine. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, and the two compounds were found to be epimers. The spectroscopic data for the ostensible benzodiazepine anacine reported from Penicillium aurantiogriseum, composed of one mole each of anthranilic acid, leucine, and glutamine, appeared very similar to those of 1. Therefore, a revised quinazoline structure for anacine is proposed.", 
    "75": "The use of psychostimulants as an adjuvant therapy in treatment-resistant depression is not very common nowadays and has been the subject of much criticism. This article gives a brief review of the literature and reports on the findings from a retrospective study carried out in 65 depressed patients treated with psychostimulants (amphetamine and methylphenidate) in addition to conventional antidepressants. Thirty-eight out of 65 patients showed significant improvement, in particular with respect to energy mood, and psychomotor activity. The best response to psychostimulants was seen in inhibited types of depression and in combination with a tricyclic antidepressant. None of the patients developed drug dependency. The incidence of side effects was low, and agitation and restlessness improved with an additional short-term treatment with benzodiazepines. It is concluded that the rapid onset of action (2-3 hours) after administration may help cover the therapeutic latency period of conventional antidepressants and probably potentiates their effect. In view of their potential benefits in treatment-resistant depressive states, psychostimulants should be tried more often.",

The purpose of this study was to quantitate benzodiazepine receptor binding in human subjects using PET and high specific activity [(11)C]Iomazenil. Six healthy human subjects underwent PET imaging following a bolus injection of high specific activity (>100 Ci/mmol) [(11)C]iomazenil. Arterial samples were collected at multiple time points after injection for measurement of unmetabolized total and nonprotein-bound parent compound in plasma. Time activity curves of radioligand concentration in brain and plasma were analyzed using two and three compartment model. Kinetic rate constants of transfer of radioligand between plasma, nonspecifically bound brain tissue, and specifically bound brain tissue compartments were fitted to the model. Values for fitted kinetic rate constants were used in the calculation of measures of benzodiazepine receptor binding, including binding potential (the ratio of receptor density to affinity), and product of BP and the fraction of free nonprotein-bound parent compound (V(3)'). Use of the three compartment model improved the goodness of fit in comparison to the two compartment model. Values for kinetic rate constants and measures of benzodiazepine receptor binding, including BP and V(3)', were similar to results obtained with the SPECT radioligand [(123)I]iomazenil, and a prior report with low specific activity [(11)C]Iomazenil. Kinetic modeling using the three compartment model with PET and high specific activity [(11)C]Iomazenil provides a reliable measure of benzodiazepine receptor binding. Synapse 35:68-77, 2000.

Adult mice were treated with diazepam (1.5 mg/kg/day - group E) or with control solution (group C1) for 7 days; some animals were only handled, receiving no treatment (group C2). Oral onco-BCG was used for peritoneal macrophage activation. Diazepam treatment: 1-decreased macrophage spreading and phagocytosis; 2-decreased the concentrations of H2O2 spontaneously but not phorbol myristate-acetate-induced release.

No differences were detected between data of groups C1 and C2 both for macrophage activity and serum corticosterone levels. The present data were explained on the basis of a synergistically action for diazepam through peripheral type binding sites (PBR) present in both adrenals and macrophages, stimulating adrenal glucocorticoid production and altering the macrophage cytokine network.", 
    "83": "Binding of [3H]Ro5-4864, a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) agonist, to BT-20 human, estrogen- (ER) and progesterone- (PR) receptor negative breast cancer cells was characterized. It was found to be specific, dose-dependent and saturable with a single population of binding sites. Dissociation constant (K(D)) was 8.5 nM, maximal binding capacity (Bmax) 339 fM/10(6) cells. Ro5-4864 (IC50 17.3 nM) and PK 11195 (IC50 12.3 nM) were able to compete with [3H]Ro5-4864 for binding, indicating specificity of interaction with PBR. Diazepam was able to displace [3H]Ro5-4864 from binding only at high concentrations (>1 microM), while ODN did not compete for PBR binding. Thymidine-uptake assay showed a biphasic response of cell proliferation. While low concentrations (100 nM) of Ro5-4864, PK 11195 and diazepam increased cell growth by 10 to 20%, higher concentrations (10-100 microM) significantly inhibited cell proliferation. PK 11195, a potent PBR ligand, was able to attenuate growth of BT-20 cells stimulated by 100 nM Ro5-4864 and to reverse growth reduction caused by 1 and 10 microM Ro5-4864, but not by 50 microM and 100 microM. This indicates that the antimitotic activity of higher concentrations of Ro5-4864 is independent of PBR binding. It is suggested, that PBR are involved in growth regulation of certain human breast cancer cell lines, possibly by supplying proliferating cells with energy, as their endogenous ligand is a polypeptide transporting Acyl-CoA.",

    "91": "This review was conducted to identify the current data on drug interactions with alprazolam, midazolam, and triazolam to guide practitioners in the use of these drugs. The Medline electronic database from 1966 through 1998 was used to identify clinical studies of the pharmacokinetic effect of drugs on these three benzodiazepines. Of a total of 491 literature reports identified, 59 prospective studies met our selection criteria. The pharmacokinetic parameters of AUC, Cmax, t1/2, and tmax were evaluated for changes following an interaction. To allow comparison between studies, changes in the parameters were normalized relative to the control values. Pharmacodynamic effects and measures, when reported in the original studies as statistically significant, were classified as a strong interaction, and when the interaction was present but not statistically significant, they were classified as mild in this review. As a result, clinically significant drug interactions were noted for all three benzodiazepines, although it is clear that statistically significant pharmacokinetic changes do not always translate into clinically significant pharmacodynamic consequences. All three benzodiazepines were susceptible to drug interactions, but oral dosing of midazolam and triazolam resulted in greater alterations in the pharmacokinetic parameters than alprazolam due to their larger presystemic extraction. Ketoconazole and itraconazole were found to be the most potent metabolic inhibitors that prolonged the duration of or intensified the magnitude of the dynamic response produced by the three benzodiazepines. Rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin were noted to be potent metabolic inducers, and their treatments result in loss of benzodiazepine therapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, potent metabolic inhibitors and inducers can either significantly prolong or diminish the dynamic effects of benzodiazepines via their influence on the pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines.",

To elucidate the role of GABAA subunits in human alcohol dependence syndrome, we identified polymorphisms in the GABAAbeta2 and GABAAalpha6 receptor subunit genes on 5q33 and assessed their potential contribution in an association study, together with a NciI RFLP at the GABAAgamma2 receptor subunit gene. One hundred and eight alcohol-dependent subjects and 54 unrelated controls were recruited from Scotland. Two novel genetic markers were identified at the GABAAbeta2 and GABAAalpha6 receptor subunit genes and examined for association with the alcohol dependence syndrome and subgroups of subjects with Korsakoff's psychosis and without Korsakoff's psychosis, together with a NciI RFLP at the GABAAgamma2 receptor subunit gene. The chi2 tests demonstrated associations between all alcohol-dependent subjects (not stratified) and the BanI RFLP at the GABAAbeta2 receptor subunit gene (P = 0.015), and the AlwNI RFLP at the GABAAalpha6 receptor gene (P = 0.013). Significant associations were also found between the alcohol-dependent subjects with Korsakoff's psychosis and the BanI RFLP (P = 0.039) and the AlwNI RFLP (P = 0.003). Haplotype analysis also provided evidence of association when all alcohol-dependent subjects (P = 0.013) and the subjects with Korsakoff's psychosis (P = 0.007) were compared with controls.

We found significantly increased risks of major congenital abnormalities for carbamazepine and valproate monotherapy, with evidence for a significant dose-response relationship for valproate. The risk of major congenital abnormalities was nonsignificantly increased for phenobarbital monotherapy when caffeine comedication was excluded, but a significant increase in risk was found when caffeine was included. Phenytoin monotherapy was not associated with an increased risk of major congenital abnormalities. Regarding polytherapy regimens, increased risks were found for several antiepileptic drug combinations. Clonazepam, in combination with other antiepileptic drugs, showed a significantly increased relative risk. Furthermore, there were significantly increased relative risks for the combination of carbamazepine and valproate and the combination of phenobarbital and caffeine with other antiepileptic drugs.

In all cases, a standard general anesthetic was administered. Thirty minutes before operating room transfer, patients in Group 0.5 mg, Group 2 mg, and Group S received 0.5 mg of midazolam, 2 mg of midazolam, or an equal volume of saline, respectively. Before study-drug administration (baseline), at 15 min thereafter, as well as on arrival in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and at 60 min and 120 min, postoperatively, we administered a digit-symbol substitution test, a mini-mental test, a shape-sorter test, and a patient-generated 100-mm visual analog score (0 = minimal and 100 = maximal) for anxiety, sleepiness, and coordination. A 4-point scale was used to assess the degree of patient sedation at 7, 15, and 30 min after study-drug administration. Using a modified Aldrete scoring system, PACU discharge was determined by the PACU staff. Patient anxiety, sleepiness, and coordination scores at baseline and at 15 min after study-drug administration were similar. When compared with saline, midazolam was associated with a significantly (P < 0.05) higher incidence of \"deep\" sedation. In Group 2 mg, the incidence of a low preoperative Spo2 (<94%) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher when compared with Group S. Emergence, extubation, and orientation times, as well as time to follow commands were unaffected by midazolam premedication. Postoperatively, the digit-symbol substitution test, mini-mental test, and shape-sorter test were similar among the groups.

I(Kr) activates rapidly at positive potentials, exhibits inward rectification caused by C-type inactivation, and is potently blocked by methanesulfon-anilide antiarrhythmic drugs and several other common medications. I(Ks) activates very slowly, does not inactivate and is blocked by some benzodiazepines and a chromanol. HERG encodes subunits that form channels that mediate I(Kr). KVLQT1 and minK encode subunits that coassemble to form channels that mediate I(Ks). Mutations in any of these genes cause long QT syndrome, a disorder of cardiac repolarization that predisposes individuals to lethal arrhythmias.

    "115": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor system triggers intracellular metabolic events and has been associated with cell proliferation. Its endogenous ligand, the diazepam binding inhibitor, contributes to steroidogenesis by promoting cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The present study was undertaken to verify whether this system is altered in tumors sited in the liver. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and diazepam binding inhibitor were studied using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization in 9 human tumors sited in the liver, in liver hyperplasia, cirrhotic nodular regeneration, intestinal adenocarcinoma and in surrounding non-tumoral tissue. Immunocytochemical staining and in situ hybridization demonstrated that peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and diazepam binding inhibitor were more prominently expressed in neoplastic cells than in non-tumoral tissue. They were present in the same cells, suggesting that diazepam binding inhibitor may act in an intracrine manner in these cells. Higher peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and diazepam binding inhibitor expression in tumor cells suggest an implication of this system in the metabolism of neoplastic cells. Furthermore the evaluation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and diazepam binding inhibitor expression might be useful in evaluating malignancy and in diagnostic approaches of tumors in liver tissue.",

However, these effects developed differently across the first medication night, across the 4 medication weeks and after withdrawal: While the 5-10 Hz effect covaried with the blood presence of the drugs as estimated from the known plasma half-lifes, showed habituation and a rebound after withdrawal, the 10-15 Hz power increased across medication days and showed no rebound. Effects in the 0.8-5 Hz band in the first medication night correlated with the decrease of sleep efficiency at later withdrawal for triazolam and zolpidem.",

However, intravenous devazepide partly antagonized pepsigogue action of intracerebroventricular cholecystokinin-8S without affecting its acid hypersecretory effect, whereas after intravenous injection of L-365,260 peptic hypersecretion evoked by intracerebroventricular cholecystokinin-8S was partially prevented and acid response was completely blocked. Similar effects were exerted by intravenous devazepide and L-365,260 against intravenous cholecystokinin-8S. A complete blockade of pepsigogue effects induced by intracerebroventricular or intravenous cholecystokinin-8S was obtained after combined intravenous treatment with devazepide plus L-365,260. Gastric hypersecretory effects of intravenous cholecystokinin-8S were not modified by bilateral vagotomy.",

    "128": "The effects of modulators of GABA-A receptors on neuronal network activity were studied in the neonatal (postnatal days 0-5) rat hippocampus in vitro. Under control conditions, the physiological pattern of activity of the neonatal hippocampal network was characterized by spontaneous network-driven giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs). The GABA-A receptor agonist isoguvacine (1-2 microM) and the allosteric modulator diazepam (2 microM) induced biphasic responses: initially the frequency of GDPs increased 3 to 4 fold followed by blockade of GDPs and desynchronization of the network activity. The GABA-A receptor antagonists bicuculline (10 microM) and picrotoxin (100 microM) blocked GDPs and induced glutamate (AMPA and NMDA)-receptor-mediated interictal- and ictal-like activities in the hippocampal slices and the intact hippocampus. These data suggest that at early postnatal ages GABA can exert a dual - both excitatory and inhibitory - action on the network activity.", 
    "129": "The clock regulating mammalian circadian rhythmicity resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The intergeniculate leaflet, a major component of the subcortical visual system, has been shown to be essential for certain aspects of circadian rhythm regulation. We now report that midbrain visual nuclei afferent to the intergeniculate leaflet are also components of the hamster circadian rhythm system. Loss of connections between the intergeniculate leaflet and visual midbrain or neurotoxic lesions of pretectum or deep superior colliculus (but not of the superficial superior colliculus) blocked phase shifts of the circadian activity rhythm in response to a benzodiazepine injection during the subjective day. Such damage did not disturb phase response to a novel wheel stimulus. The amount of wheel running or open field locomotion were equivalent in lesioned and control groups after benzodiazepine treatment. Electrical stimulation of the deep superior colliculus, without its own effect on circadian rhythm phase, greatly attenuated light-induced phase shifts. Such stimulation was associated with increased FOS protein immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The results show that the circadian rhythm system includes the visual midbrain and distinguishes between mechanisms necessary for phase response to benzodiazepine and those for phase response to locomotion in a novel wheel. The results also refute the idea that benzodiazepine-induced phase shifts are the consequence of induced locomotion. Finally, the data provide the first indication that the visual midbrain can modulate circadian rhythm response to light. A variety of environmental stimuli may gain access to the circadian clock mechanism through subcortical nuclei projecting to the intergeniculate leaflet and, via the final common path of the geniculohypothalamic tract, from the leaflet to the suprachiasmatic nucleus.", 
    "130": "Modulation of GABA(A) receptors by benzodiazepines (BZDs) is believed to involve two distinct steps: a recognition step in which BZDs bind and a conformational transition step in which the affinity of the receptor for GABA changes. Previously, using gamma(2)/alpha(1) chimeric subunits (chi), we demonstrated that although the N-terminal 167 gamma(2) amino acid residues confer high-affinity BZD binding, other gamma(2) domains couple BZD binding to potentiation of the GABA-mediated Cl(-) current (I(GABA)). To determine which gamma(2) regions couple binding to potentiation, we generated chis with longer N-terminal gamma(2) segments for voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes. Chimeras containing greater than the N-terminal 167 gamma(2) residues showed incremental gains in maximal potentiation for diazepam enhancement of I(GABA). Residues in gamma(2)199-236, gamma(2)224-236 (pre-M1), and particularly gamma(2)257-297 (M2 and surrounding loops) are important for BZD potentiation. For several positive BZD modulators tested, the same regions restored potentiation of I(GABA). In contrast, beta-carboline inverse-agonism was unaltered in chimeric receptors, suggesting that structural determinants for positive and negative BZD allosteric modulation are different. Dissection of the gamma(2)257-297 domain revealed that three residues in concert, gamma(2)T281, gamma(2)I282 (M2 channel vestibule), and gamma(2)S291 (M2-M3 loop) are necessary to impart full BZD potentiation to chimeric receptors. Thus, these residues participate in coupling distant BZD-binding events to conformational changes in the GABA(A) receptor. The location of these novel residues provides insight into the mechanisms underlying allosteric coupling for other members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily.", 
    "131": "A 1:1 combination (by weight) of zolazepam and tiletamine is the drug of choice for anesthetizing polar bears (Ursus maritimus), but recovery time is prolonged when additional doses are administered. Recoveries may last 24 hr and may threaten the health of the bears. We compared the anesthetic effects of zolazepam-tiletamine (ZT) with those of medetomidine-ketamine (MK) and medetomidine-zolazepam-tiletamine (MZT) in 93 free-ranging polar bears. The MZT combination was administered in smaller dose and volume, resulted in more rapid, safer, and more predictable induction, provided more reliable anesthesia, and was safely reversed with atipamezole. Frequent occurrence of sudden recoveries during anesthesia with MK limited our use of this combination. MK and MZT sometimes caused apnea and bradycardia initially and hyperthermia at increased ambient temperatures. Hypoxemia occurred transiently with all combinations. When anesthesia with ZT and MK exceeded 1 hr, frequent necessary top-up doses caused irregular physiologic function. ZT is recommended for short duration anesthesia (< or = 1 hr), but MZT is better for anesthesia of longer duration and under circumstances where reversibility is desirable.", 
    "132": "Several current hypotheses consider the process of attribution of importance to stimuli and the integration of actually perceived reality with experience as a cognitive base for the genesis of delusions. We tested these models by a comparison of deluded schizophrenics, healthy controls, and anxious patients on reasoning under uncertainty. Reasoning under uncertainty was examined in currently deluded schizophrenics (n = 29), in 16 of them also in remission, in normal control groups (n = 35), and in anxious patients (n = 31) using a probabilistic inference task. Acutely psychotic schizophrenics were less ready than normal subjects, anxious patients, and schizophrenics, in remission to modify their judgement in probabilistic situation confronted with potentially disconfirmatory data. They were also less prone than anxious patients and schizophrenics in remission to correct their estimate confronted with confirmatory data. The data support the hypothesis of a weaker influence of incoming stimuli on reasoning under uncertainty as a cognitive base of the maintenance of delusions.", 
    "133": "The aims were to examine the kinetics of the oxidative metabolism of flunitrazepam in vitro when flunitrazepam was dissolved in dimethylformamide and acetonitrile, and to determine which cytochrome P450 isoform(s) are involved. The kinetics of the formations of 3'-hydroxyflunitrazepam and desmethyl-flunitrazepam were non-linear and best estimated using the Hill equation. Inhibition of their formation was studied using specific chemical inhibitors, expressed enzyme systems and specific antibodies. Ks, Vmax, Clmax and n (slope factor) for the formation of 3'-hydroxyflunitrazepam and desmethylflunitrazepam had ranges of 165-338 and 179 391 microM, 22-81 and 3-10 nmol x mg protein(-1) x h(-1), 6-17 and 0.9-1.9 microl x mg protein(-1) x h(-1), and 2.3-3.6 and 1.6-2.6 respectively when dimethylformamide was the organic solvent. When acetonitrile was the solvent, Ks, Vmax, Clmax and n (slope factor) for the formation of 3'-hydroxyflunitrazepam and desmethylflunitrazepam had ranges of 173-231 and 74-597 microM, 35-198 and 2.7-48 nmol.mg protein(-1) x h(-1), 1347 and 0.7-6.3 microl.mg protein(-1) x h(-1), and 1.5-3.6 and 1.1-2.7 respectively. CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 mediated the formation of both 3'-hydroxyflunitrazepam and desmethylflunitrazepam. Investigators need carefully to consider the choice of organic solvent to avoid false CYP identification.", 
    "134": "This study examined the nature of the interactions of etifoxine, an anxiolytic and anticonvulsant compound, with the GABA(A) receptor/chloride channel complex. In membrane preparations of Sprague-Dawley rat cerebral cortex, etifoxine competitively inhibited the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphoro-thionate (TBPS), a specific ligand of the GABA(A) receptor chloride channel site. In vivo studies demonstrated an anticonvulsant effect of etifoxine (50 and 75 mg/kg, i.p.) against the clonic convulsions induced by TBPS in CD1 mice. Flumazenil (10 and 40 mg/kg, i.p.), an antagonist of benzodiazepine sites at GABA(A) receptors, had no effect on the action of etifoxine. These findings suggest that etifoxine exerts its effect by interacting with the Cl- channel of GABA(A) receptors and probably by facilitating GABAergic inhibition.", 
    "135": "The effect of GYKI 52466, a selective, non-competitive antagonist of the AMPA glutamate receptor subtype was investigated on the development, expression and propagation of 3-aminopyridine-induced cortical ictal activity, both in the primary and secondary focus. In one group of animals GYKI 52466 was administered intraperitoneally, 20 minutes prior to the local application of the convulsant the surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. Control animals were injected by physiological solution. Different parameters of electrographic ictal discharges were measured under the influence of the antagonist and compared to control values. The results demonstrate that GYKI 52466 exerts anticonvulsive effects on both the induction and the expression of primary and secondary electrical ictal activity, by delaying the onset of the first ictal period, shortening the duration of ictal activity and decreasing the amplitudes of epileptiform discharges. However, the seizure propagation was not influenced significantly. It is suggested that the initiation, maintenance and the propagation of spontaneous seizures may be controlled by separate mechanisms and that changes can occur in one of the procedures without parallel changes in others. The observations of the present study extend those reported previously by others, namely that activation of non-NMDA receptors is significantly involved in the initiation and maintenance of cortical epileptiform activity.", 
    "136": "Our previous studies have shown that central-type benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors (CBR) and neurosteroids capable of modulating GABA(A) receptor function are involved in the decrease of pentobarbital (PB)-induced sleep caused by social isolation stress in mice. In this study, to further clarify the mechanism underlying this decrease, we investigated the possible involvement of peripheral-type BZD receptors (PBR) which play an important role in neurosteroidogenesis in PB sleep in socially isolated mice. Socially isolated mice showed significantly shorter duration of PB-induced sleep than group-housed animals. When injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), FGIN-1-27 (FGIN, 25-100 nmol), a selective PBR agonist, and PK11195 (PK, 14-28 nmol), a PBR antagonist, and pregnenolone (PREG, 15-30 nmol), a neurosteroid precursor, dose-dependently normalized the PB sleep in isolated mice without having an effect on the group-housed animals. In contrast, pregnenolone sulfate (PS, 24 nmol), an endogenous neurosteroidal negative allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor, reduced PB sleep in group-housed but not isolated mice. PS, at the same dose, significantly attenuated the effects of FGIN (100 nmol), PK (28 nmol) and PREG (30 nmol) in isolated mice, while FGIN (100 nmol), PK (28 nmol) and pregnenolone (30 nmol) significantly blocked the effect of PS (24 nmol) in group-housed mice. These results suggest that the PBR-mediated decrease in the genesis of neurosteroid(s) possessing a GABA(A) receptor agonistic profile is also partly involved in the down regulation of the GABA(A) receptor following long-term social isolation and contributes to the decrease of PB-induced sleep in isolation stressed mice.", 
    "137": "A liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric technique was designed for the determination of the anaesthetic benzodiazepine midazolam (MID) and its active metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam (1-OHM), with the aim of conducting pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies. MID and 1-OHM were extracted from alkalinised (pH 9.5) spiked and clinical serum samples using a single step, liquid-liquid extraction procedure with diethyl ether-2-propanol (98:2, v/v). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Nucleosil C18, 5 microm (150x1 mm I.D.) column, using a gradient of acetonitrile in 5 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.0 as the mobile phase, delivered at a flow-rate of 50 microl/min. The compounds were ionised in the ionspray source of an atmospheric pressure mass spectrometer, fragmented by in-source collisions and the pseudomolecular and fragment ions detected in the selected ion monitoring mode. The recovery was between 79 and 87% for MID, between 83 and 87% for 1-OHM and 81.5% for methylclonazepam. The limit of detection was 0.2 microg/l for MID and 0.5 microg/l for 1-OHM, the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.5 microg/l for both. Linearity was verified from these LOQs up to 2000 microg/l and the method was found accurate and precise over this range. It was successfully applied to a preliminary study to establish the concentration versus time curve of MID and 1-OHM in a patient administered midazolam by continuous infusion.", 
    "138": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in the hours or days after the cessation of alcohol drinking in an alcohol dependent patient. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.", 
    "139": "About 75% of women in reproductive age have some premenstrual changes. It is estimated that 2% to 10% of women experience symptoms severe enough to interfere with their professional or social activities and they meet the DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Benzodiazepines and antidepressants have been shown to be effective treatments for PMDD; GnRH agonists are the second choice. New findings support the opinion that intermittent dosing of some antidepressants, e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is equivalent in efficacy to continuous drug treatment. The aim of the present study was to analyze the characteristics of premenstrual symptoms. In addition, the authors wanted to estimate the efficacy of intermittent sertraline dosing in the treatment of women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The study involved women employed in Vrapce Psychiatric Hospital. One hundred and thirty seven of them were examined for the presence of premenstrual symptoms. Seven women with PMDD were included in the treatment with sertraline. Symptoms were monitored with daily reports using the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences (COPE). Six women completed the study. In three of them, sertraline given during the luteal phase produced significant improvements of premenstrual symptoms.", 
    "140": "A review of techniques used to screen biological specimens for the presence of drugs was conducted with particular reference to systematic toxicological analysis. Extraction systems of both the liquid-liquid and solid-phase type show little apparent difference in their relative ability to extract a range of drugs according to their physio-chemical properties, although mixed-phase SPE extraction is a preferred technique for GC-based applications, and liquid-liquid were preferred for HPLC-based applications. No one chromatographic system has been shown to be capable of detecting a full range of common drugs of abuse, and common ethical drugs, hence two or more assays are required for laboratories wishing to cover a reasonably comprehensive range of drugs of toxicological significance. While immunoassays are invariably used to screen for drugs of abuse, chromatographic systems relying on derivatization and capable of extracting both acidic and basic drugs would be capable of screening a limited range of targeted drugs. Drugs most difficult to detect in systematic toxicological analysis include LSD, psilocin, THC and its metabolites, fentanyl and its designer derivatives, some potent opiates, potent benzodiazepines and some potent neuroleptics, many of the newer anti-convulsants, alkaloids colchicine, amantins, aflatoxins, antineoplastics, coumarin-based anti-coagulants, and a number of cardiovascular drugs. The widespread use of LC-MS and LC-MS-MS for specific drug detection and the emergence of capillary electrophoresis linked to MS and MS-MS provide an exciting possibility for the future to increase the range of drugs detected in any one chromatographic screening system.",

    "142": "We report the case of a patient suffering from dysthymia. He underwent successful ECT treatment and was medicated with nefazodone and midazolam. Comparing the EEG and motor seizure duration in the periods with and without midazolam, no significant differences were recorded, but the dosage of thiopental and of succinylcholine had to be increased markedly after midazolam was discontinued (P < 0.05; ANOVA). This case indicates a substantial pharmacodynamic interaction between nefazodone, midazolam, thiopental, and succinylcholine.", 
    "143": "The atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine has been proposed for treatment of dopaminergic psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). We report on a 68-year-old patient who developed a severe akinetic-rigid extrapyramidal syndrome, accompanied by additional paranoid symptoms, following olanzapine treatment of optic hallucinosis in PD. Olanzapine may also induce clinically relevant extrapyramidal side effects in PD patients.", 
    "144": "A mechanism-based model is proposed for the analysis of adaptive changes in the pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines in vivo.", 
    "145": "The pharmacodynamics of midazolam was studied in the kindling model of experimental epilepsy. Concentration-EEG effect data from kindled rats and their controls were fitted to the operational model of agonism. A stepwise procedure was used, allowing changes in the parameters efficacy (tau) and tissue maximum (Em) either separately or in combination. The results were compared to data obtained in vitro in a brain synaptoneurosomal preparation.", 
    "146": "The relationship between midazolam concentration and EEG effect was non-linear. In kindled rats the maximum EEG effect was reduced by 27+/-8.3 microV from the original value of 94+/-4.4 microV. Analysis on the basis of the operational model of agonism showed that this decrease could be explained by a difference in the parameter system maximum (Em) rather than efficacy (tau). In the in vitro receptor binding assay no changes in density, affinity or functionality of the benzodiazepine receptor were observed, consistent with the lack of a change in efficacy (tau).",
