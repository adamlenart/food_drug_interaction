In both species, SC-32855 caused arrest of spermatogenesis and degeneration of the germinal epithelium, however, it had no effect on Sertoli or Leydig cells. There were no meaningful effects on the weights of the testis, epididymis or prostate in either species. Mean serum luteinizing hormone concentrations in dogs, which were 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml prior to dosing, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.5 ng/ml after dosing for the control and treatment groups, respectively, were not significantly changed. Mean serum testosterone concentrations in dogs, which were 1.11 +/- 0.13 and 0.95 +/- 0.10 ng/ml prior to dosing, and 1.05 +/- 0.15 and 1.17 +/- 0.16 ng/ml after dosing for the control and treatment groups, respectively, were also not significantly changed. Further, SC-32855 in vitro did not inhibit the synthesis of testosterone in testicular microsomes isolated from normal rats or dogs. These data indicate that SC-32855 causes testicular damage, which is not secondary to decreased testosterone.", 
    "1": "The olfactory cortex slice preparation from guinea-pig has been used to test compounds which inhibit the cellular uptake of adenosine. The uptake inhibitors dipyridamole (0.1-10 mumol/l), dilazep (1-10 mumol/l) nitrobenzylthioguanosine (1-10 mumol/l), nitrobenzylthioinosine (0.1-5 mumol/l), and hexobendine (1-100 mumol/l) increased the potency of adenosine (0.1-30 mumol/l) by up to 5-fold but did not potentiate cyclohexyladenosine (0.01-10 mumol/l). The benzodiazepine, diazepam (1 mumol/l) slightly increased the potency of adenosine (by 1.7-fold) whereas flurazepam (3 mumol/l) had no effect, suggesting that inhibition of adenosine uptake is probably not the major therapeutic action of these compounds. The uptake inhibitors depressed the amplitude of the monosynaptic epsp when added alone, an effect reversed by adenosine deaminase (1 unit/ml) whereas the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (10 mumol/l) had no effect on adenosine action. These results show that in this preparation (a) adenosine action is attenuated by an uptake mechanism and (b) endogenous adenosine release normally has no apparent effects on synaptic transmission at low stimulus rates. Nitrobenzylthioinosine and nitrobenzylthioguanosine are probably the best uptake blockers.", 
    "2": "This 5-year review of deliberate self-poisoning cases seen in an accident and emergency department revealed that about 700 patients were seen per year. Three-quarters of these needed admission (forming some 15% of all hospital admissions). Of these 65% were referred to the psychiatrist. The remaining quarter were dealt with in the accident and emergency department. Analysis of the data identifies problems where further research is needed. In particular the question is raised as to whether these patients would not be better dealt with in an acute medical unit now that accident departments are turning their attention increasingly to the management of trauma.", 
    "3": "The effects of stimulation of carotid body chemoreceptors on blood pressure, heart rate and ventilation were compared in normal rats and rats with local or generalised tetanus toxicity induced by injection of the toxin. Carotid chemoreceptor stimulation in an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate in both control and tetanus rats. However, while chemoreceptor stimulation resulted in increases in ventilation of 115% and 123% in normal rats and rats with local tetanus respectively, the increase in rats with generalised tetanus was only 29%. The experiments indicate that normal rats and rats with tetanus toxicity exhibit identical pressor and heart rate responses to stimulation of carotid chemoreceptors whereas the ventilatory response is attenuated in the tetanus rats.", 
    "4": "Uremia in humans can cause spontaneous and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus that responds to clonazepam. Uremic myoclonus in humans resembles the reticular reflex form of postanoxic action myoclonus. Previous investigations have established that urea infusions in the cat can produce spontaneous and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. This has been shown, electrophysiologically, to arise in the brainstem medullary reticular formation, and it does not require forebrain structures. Our own studies in the rat have shown that urea infusions also produce spontaneous and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. Electrophysiologically, this resembles human reticular reflex myoclonus. It can be reduced by clonazepam. The myoclonus produced by urea infusions in the rat progresses very rapidly into uncontrollable tonic-clonic convulsions. Although the urea model in the rat mimics some forms of human myoclonus that arise in the brainstem, it is not suitable as a routine animal model for pharmacological investigations.", 
    "5": "In rare cases, rhythmic limb movements may appear in association with palatal myoclonus. There is a similar slow rate, below 4/sec. A review by Rondot and Ben Hamida (33) showed that the limb movements had much in common with postural tremors. Lhermitte and Sigwald (23) observed a peculiar pattern of upper limb oscillations in a patient with palatal myoclonus. It resembles a rare type of slow postural tremor, often called rubral tremor, described by Holmes (19). We found that a large group of alcoholics, showing signs of cerebellar degeneration, exhibit a stereotyped pattern of slow, coarse leg oscillations. There is a stable rhythm, in the 3/sec range, in alternating as well as in nonalternating muscle contractions. Both are in several maintained postures bicrurally synchronous, which is a feature of experimental and clinical myoclonus never observed in classic tremors. A few of these patients have upper limb oscillations, and these are of the kind described by Holmes (19) and Lhermitte and Sigwald (23). The cerebellar degeneration is of the anteromedial type; it is often associated with olivary changes (cerebelloolivary atrophy). Swanson et al. (40) and others included in the spinal category patients with myoclonus restricted to muscles innervated from one or more spinal cord segments and no recognizable neurological abnormality at higher levels. The most convincing cases of purely spinal origin are those in which segmental jerks are caused by a spinal tumor. These repetitive jerks may sometimes show a slow rhythm.", 
    "6": "The acute administration of ethanol, pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide impaired, in a dose-dependent manner, the performance of rats on the moving-belt and two-way shuttle-box avoidance tests. Administration of these drugs for three weeks resulted in tolerance to their motor-impairing effects. Tolerance to ethanol or pentobarbital was characterized by a parallel shift of the dose-response curve to the right. Tolerance to chlordiazepoxide, however, was of greater extent and was accompanied by an apparent flattening of the dose-response curve. Symmetrical cross-tolerance developed between ethanol and pentobarbital. On the other hand, while chlordiazepoxide treatment conferred full cross-tolerance to ethanol and pentobarbital, only partial cross-tolerance to chlordiazepoxide was observed following treatment with ethanol or pentobarbital. These results suggest that at least part of the tolerance to chlordiazepoxide depends on changes in specific benzodiazepine receptors and is independent of the tolerance associated with non-specific changes in the cell membrane.", 
    "7": "The in vitro binding and distribution of drugs to human serum and rat liver cytosol was examined in a three-compartment distribution dialysis system where the free drug concentration could be determined. The effects of high concentrations of volatile anaesthetics and their metabolites on distribution and binding were also investigated. Restrictively eliminated drugs (warfarin, phenytoin, diazepam) distributed more slowly and demonstrated lower cytosol:serum binding ratios (0.09, 0.11 and 0.11, respectively) as compared with the non-restrictively eliminated drugs propranolol and prazosin with distribution ratios of 0.62 and 1.1, respectively. The rapid distribution in favour of liver cytosol may partly explain the high hepatic extraction ratio of non-restrictively eliminated drugs in vivo. Enflurane showed the most significant influence on drug binding as it was the only compound to displace propranolol and prazosin from serum. Furthermore, enflurane displaced phenytoin and diazepam from both serum and cytosol simultaneously, creating marked increases in the free drug concentrations of 60 and 113%, respectively. Halothane was shown to be a weaker agent than enflurane with respect to the ability to displace drugs from serum proteins and liver cytosol. Neither enflurane nor halothane influenced significantly the binding or distribution of warfarin. In contrast, trifluoroacetic acid did not displace any drugs from cytosol, but displaced restrictively eliminated drugs from serum. It is suggested that the ability of enflurane to displace specific drugs from both serum proteins and liver cytosol may be of clinical relevance.", 
    "8": "Thirty-three patients received either 10 ml (group A) or 50 ml (group B) of water with diazepam tablets as premedication while in the supine position. Plasma diazepam concentrations were measured, a delay in the attainment of the peak plasma concentration being taken as an indication of delayed absorption and oesophageal hold-up. There was no difference between the two groups, although in an important minority (16.7% (group A) and 20% (group B], absorption was delayed to beyond 60 min. There was a wide scatter of plasma diazepam concentrations in both groups. Dysphagia during swallowing did not appear to delay absorption.", 
    "9": "The effects of antibiotics and other commonly used medications on the human polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes' (PMNs) nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-reduced (NADPH) oxidase activity have been investigated in vitro. Five antibiotics (penicillin G sodium, cefamandole nafate, metronidazole hydrochloride, clindamycin phosphate, and tobramycin sulfate, and a triple combination of penicillin G sodium-metronidazole hydrochloride-tobramycin sulfate) and two sedatives (morphine sulfate and diazepam) were incubated with normal human PMNs at therapeutic, infratherapeutic, and supratherapeutic drug levels. The superoxide dismutase-inhibitable, NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome C in the PMNs was studied after stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucine-phenylalanine. Tobramycin sulfate and the triple combination of penicillin G sodium-metronidazole hydrochloride-tobramycin sulfate significantly reduced the NADPH oxidase activity at all dosages studied. Clindamycin phosphate, morphine sulfate, and diazepam also showed significant reduction at therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations. Penicillin G sodium, cefamandole nafate, and metronidazole hydrochloride did not cause a decrease in enzyme activity at any levels tested. We conclude that NADPH oxidase activity can be adversely affected by the circulating levels of common antibiotics and sedatives.", 
    "10": "We describe 14 hypersomniac patients whose polysomnographic recordings revealed abnormal EEG patterns consisting of paroxysmal epileptic discharges during stages 2 and 3 of NREM sleep, associated with arousals, fragmentation of sleep, and reduction in sleep efficiency, particularly REM sleep. Three patients who received anticonvulsants showed clinical and polysomnographic documented improvement in sleep patterns. These patients probably had a unique form of nocturnal epilepsy-related sleep disorder, manifested by paroxysmal wakenings from sleep.", 
    "11": "The effects of two different kinds of stress (social and physical) on central adenosine receptors were investigated in mouse whole brain membranes using 1,3-diethyl-8-[3H]phenylxanthine ([3H]DPX) as a ligand. Chronic but not acute social stress induced an increase in the number of adenosine receptors similar to that induced by chronic, nontoxic doses of caffeine. Acute but not chronic social stress also induced an increase in the number of benzodiazepine receptors labeled by [3H]beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester. The group submitted chronically to both stress and caffeine showed an increase in [3H]DPX binding relative to that found with either of these factors alone. The adenosine uptake site, labeled by [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine, was not modified by either stress or caffeine administration.", 
    "12": "Flurazepam (30 mg), triazolam (0.5 mg) and placebo were given in the morning to 6 normal volunteers in a double-blind crossover study. Subjects were evaluated by a large battery of psychophysiological tests before and 1 and 5 hours after drug administration. Triazolam was significantly more sedative than flurazepam and both were significantly different from placebo. Slope-ratio assay analysis of the results from the present study pooled with those from a similar previous study (C. Gorenstein and V. Gentil, Psychopharmacology, 80: 376-379, 1983) indicated that these doses are non-equivalent. We suggest that dose-equivalence studies based on the present method should be carried out early in the development of new hypnotic drugs.", 
    "13": "The effect of pharmacological drugs indicated for specific diseases on the lower esophageal sphincter, was studied in 195 patients. Pentagastrin increased the sphincter tone, secretin when used in peptic ulcer, did not influence the tone. Unlike atropine, a therapeutic course with pirenzepine (gastrozepin) for patients with peptic ulcer did not lower the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. Diazepam significantly decreased indices of the sphincter tone. In the treatment of CHD patients with corinfar, a calcium antagonist, the sphincter tone was on a moderate but statistically significant decrease. Aminophylline in patients with chronic bronchitis made no effect on this index. The ratio of the sphincter tone stimulated with metoclopramide to its basal values was higher in the patients with initially lowered indices as compared to the patients in whom the initial tone was within normal.", 
    "14": "[3H]Flu and [3H]GABA binding has been studied in mice and Rabbit cerebellum (Ce). The Bmax of [3H]Flu binding in Ce membranes is similar in all mice strains examined and Rabbit. However, in Ce homogenate there are significant differences in both kd and Bmax. Subcellular distribution shows higher [3H]Flu binding in the nuclear than in the membranous fraction. However, the [3H]GABA binding is lower in the nuclear than the membranous fraction.", 
    "15": "A double blind study has been carried out on patients scheduled for appendicectomy. They were divided into two groups who were given diazepam as premedication either orally or intramuscularly. The clinical effects were measured with regard to anxiolysis, gastric contents volume and acidity. Orally premedicated patients were not significantly less anxious. No significant differences between both groups concerning gastric contents (volume and pH) were found. Therefore, oral premedication did not increase the risk of inhalation. Taking into account the previous findings in the literature, the pharmacological advantages of the oral route and the lack of complications, a wider use of oral premedication for elective operations in adults is recommended.", 
    "16": "The article investigates the effect of N-aminomethylpiperazine-3,3-diethyl-2,4-pyridinedione (DKMP), a newly-synthesized compound with a clearly manifested anticonvulsant action, on the aggressive behaviour and on the training for active two-way avoidance by using a shuttle-box. The effects of DKMP were compared with the effects of Diazepam on mouse killing behaviour and avoidance training both of isolated aggressive rats and of rats reared in groups. It was found that DKMP (100 mg/kg, subcutaneously) inhibited the aggressiveness in 88 per cent of the aggressive rats, whereas Diazepam (1 mg/kg, i. p.)--in 75 per cent for 4 hours. DKMP manifested a more substantial positive effect on learning (higher number of avoidances) in the aggressive rats, whereas Diazepam had a better effect on the group-reared rats. Both compounds shortened the latencies of the avoidances of aggressive rats, inducing no changes in the grouped rats. The results obtained show that with respect to the effects studied there is similarity in the pharmacological activities of DKMP and Diazepam, indicating only some not very essential quantitative differences.", 
    "17": "A 41-year-old patient with the rigidity syndrome was observed. The disease was expressed in marked rigidity of the long muscles of the back forming a picture of persistent hyperlordosis which led to a considerable disablement of the patient. Another complaint was spasms of the femoral muscles. A four-year follow-up of the patient revealed periodically recurring ataxia, nystagmus, and dysarthria. The patient benefited by relanium (diazepam) administration. On the basis of the literature data and a clinical analysis of this case the authors review clinical, differential-diagnostic, pathogenetic and etiological aspects of the rigidity syndrome.", 
    "18": "Eight cases of [absence status] are reported, occurring in old patients (7 females, 1 male), mean age 75 years, without any known history of epilepsy. The main clinical feature was a fluctuating state of consciousness, during which the EEG showed diffuse spikes and polyspikes with a frontal predominance. These abnormalities disappeared after intravenous benzodiazepine administration, resulting in most cases in a spectacular clinical improvement. Five of our patients had a depressive history and were taking antidepressive or psychotropic drugs. Hyponatremia or hypokalemia probably secondary to diuretic medications, was present in 4 cases. No recurrence occurred with or without long-term anti-epileptic medication.", 
    "19": "Effects of two opioid analgesics on performance and their interactions with diazepam were studied double-blind and cross over in ten healthy students. At two-week intervals the subjects received first a single oral dose of placebo, codeine (100 mg) or pentazocine (75 mg). Then, 1 h 30 min later they were all given diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) orally. Lastly, naloxone (0.4 mg) was injected intravenously at 4 h. In addition to this, the subjects on pentazocine received a second 75 mg dose at 3 h. Codeine and pentazocine alone failed to affect performance in objective tests (body sway, digit symbol substitution, flicker fusion, Maddox wing, nystagmus) recorded at 1 h 30 min. Visual analogue scales showed subjective drug effects: pentazocine made the volunteers talkative, contented, interested and energetic, whilst codeine rendered them mentally slow. 75 mg of pentazocine and 100 mg of codeine produced comparable plasma opiate activity (determined in morphine equivalents) according to radioreceptor bioassay with [3H]-dihydromorphine as a ligand. Impaired performance was clear at the tests done 1.5 and 2.5 h after diazepam. No major interactions were found between opiates and diazepam in objective tests with the exception that nystagmus was stronger after the combined treatment than after diazepam alone. Codeine reduced the absorption of diazepam. Subjectively codeine and pentazocine counteracted the effects of diazepam. The subjects overestimated their performance after opiate + diazepam when compared to diazepam alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Two new techniques for the analysis of the human sleep-wake cycle are presented and illustrated. The first is based on a wrist-worn solid-state activity monitor which can record movement activity for prolonged time periods. The method has been applied to document phase-shifts of the rest-activity cycle after crossing time-zones; to analyze the effect of hypnotic drugs on movements during sleep; and to record the severe disruption of sleep and waking in narcolepsy. The second technique consists of all-night spectral analysis of the sleep EEG. In addition to conventional sleep stage scoring by visual analysis, power density values of the sleep EEG are computed for 4-sec epochs in the range of 0.25-25.0 Hz. The spectra provide a more refined and quantitative description of the sleep process than analysis of the sleep stage distribution. The method revealed within individual sleep stages significant trends through the night as well as specific changes induced by sleep deprivation. Spectral analysis was also applied for determining the effect of benzodiazepine hypnotics on the sleep EEG, and for documenting subtle, residual drug effects in the following drug-free night.", 
    "21": "We studied the Oddi sphincter motility by endoscopic manometry in 10 consecutive patients randomized in a double-blind fashion, after i.v. administration of two anticholinergic compounds (0.5 mg atropine sulfate and 10 mg pirenzepine). Pirenzepine significantly decreased the basal sphincteric pressure, as well as the amplitude and frequency of the phasic contractions. The only significant effect of atropine was the modification of the frequency of the phasic contractions, but only for a short period of time. Our results suggest that muscarinic innervation must be present for a normal sphincter of Oddi motility.", 
    "22": "Oxazepam treatment of primiparous mouse dams on days 12-16 of pregnancy (15 mg/kg p.o. twice daily) produced a transient retardation of postnatal body growth and neurobehavioral development, a reduction of the hyperactivity response to amphetamine in open-field tests on postnatal days 14-16, and a selective impairment of adult active avoidance in four go-no go discrimination tasks. Equally important for understanding the nature of the prenatal benzodiazepine syndrome were several negative results, namely, the absence of changes in homing performance on postnatal day 10, an intact hyperactivity response to scopolamine on postnatal days 21-23, a lack of effects on adult activity, and a normal passive avoidance performance in the go-no go tasks. A modification in monoaminergic regulatory functions may account for the overall profile of prenatal drug effects. Based on the results of this experiment, of a preliminary multidose study (0-50 mg/kg), and of an additional cross-fostering experiment, several methodological issues are addressed. These include the choice of appropriate treatment schedules and of testing procedures adequate for each developmental stage, and the control for various confounding variables such as litter effects, postnatal maternal influences, and developmental history.", 
    "23": "The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]arginine vasopressin, [3H]spiperone, [3H]GABA, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and the peripheral-type benzodiazepine ligand [3H]Ro5-4864 were examined in the rat pituitary before and after pituitary stalk transection. Stalk transection produced dramatic changes in the cellular architecture of the pars nervosa. Glial fibrillary acidic protein, an astrocyte marker reported in pituicytes, increased after stalk transection, whereas neurofilament, a marker for neuronal innervation, was lost. These structural changes demonstrated a successful stalk transection, permitting interpretation of changes in the densities of several [3H]-ligands over the three lobes. [3H]Ro5-4864 binding was markedly increased, suggesting that this site was located on the pituicytes. Conversely [3H]spiperone and [3H]arginine vasopressin binding density over the pars nervosa decreased. In the mutant diabetes insipidus rat (Brattleboro), which lacks pituitary vasopressin, [3H]arginine vasopressin binding was undetectable in the pars nervosa. [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]GABA binding sites were unchanged by the lesion. These results are discussed in terms of the occurrence of functional acceptors on pituicytes and their possible role in neurohydrophyseal secretions.", 
    "24": "The effects of pirenzepine (P), a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, on growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) response to dermorphin (D) were studied in a group of 7 healthy men. D produced clear elevations in GH and PRL levels. P completely blocked the GH-releasing activity of D, whereas it did not alter the PRL-releasing activity. These results indicate that GH-releasing action of D is mediated via the central cholinergic nervous system in man.", 
    "25": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) (EC50 = 5 nM) was considerably more potent than pentagastrin (EC50 = 161 nM) in stimulating acid secretion in the isolated perfused mouse stomach suspended in a medium containing a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The maximum acid response to CCK-8 was not significantly different from that produced by pentagastrin. The nonselective CCK/gastrin antagonist, proglumide, but not the selective CCK antagonist, asperlicin, antagonized the acid response to both pentagastrin and CCK-8. The data suggest that CCK-8 acts as a potent, full agonist on gastrin receptors for acid secretion in the isolated mouse stomach.", 
    "26": "Sixty patients undergoing elective minor gynaecological surgery received oral pre-operative medication with 10 mg diazepam in either conventional tablet form on the morning of operation or as the sustained-release tablet the night before. Subjective and objective assessments of the effectiveness of premedication were made. Patients receiving sustained-release diazepam on the night before surgery experienced fewer periods of wakefulness than those who received placebo. Patients who were given diazepam on the morning of surgery felt more drowsy pre-operatively than those who received sustained-release diazepam the night before.", 
    "27": "Bicyclic phosphorus esters (BCP) originating from the combustion of fire-retardant polyurethane foam containing phosphorus are highly toxic compounds and potent antagonists of GABA-ergic receptors. The clinical symptoms of the poisoning are grand mal seizures. The results of experiments on rats demonstrated that diazepam and phenobarbital reduce acute toxicity of the isopropyl-BCP-derivative and remarkably smooth poisoning symptoms.", 
    "28": "An evaluation of a commercial TLC Kit System (Toxi-Lab) is described. The performance of the system is assessed in the detection of drugs in overdose and in therapy, and is compared with a GC drug screening system. Toxi-Lab performed well in investigating drug overdoses. We found data on metabolite patterns essential for the identification of drugs in urine and for this reason the system performed much better than GC screening in which information on metabolites is limited. In our experience Toxi-Lab screening was not sufficiently sensitive for the detection of commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs taken in therapeutic doses. This system is rapid, versatile and suitable for small laboratories, but is comparatively expensive and some expertise is necessary to interpret results. A major deficiency of the kit is that the identification procedures are designed for the detection of drugs available in the USA and many drugs prescribed in the UK have been omitted.", 
    "29": "Hydrolysis and rearrangement (isomerization by acyl migration) of oxaprozin glucuronide are greatly accelerated by plasma and human serum albumin. Albumin accounts for all the hydrolytic activity in plasma and no esterase is involved. The isomeric esters formed by rearrangement are also good substrates for the hydrolysis reaction. Another reaction between oxaprozin glucuronide and albumin leads to covalent binding of the aglycone. Similar reactions leading to covalent binding have been described for other acyl glucuronides by several investigators. In the case of oxaprozin, there is little or no potential for biological significance of covalent binding because the reaction is almost entirely inhibited by low concentrations of the drug. All three reactions are pH dependent but not to the same extent. They can be considered to be transacylations to the hydroxyl ion (hydrolysis), to a different OH-group of the glucuronic acid moiety (rearrangement) or to a nucleophilic group on the albumin molecule (covalent binding). All three reactions are greatly inhibited by the same compounds suggesting a common reaction site. This site has certain features in common with the indole or benzodiazepine binding site of human serum albumin. A scheme is proposed in which the first step is reversible binding of the acyl glucuronide to this site in analogy to the known reversible binding of reactive esters (such as p-nitrophenyl acetate) to the same site. All three reactions are inhibited by compounds such as naproxen and decanoic acid which are known to also inhibit the acylation of albumin by reactive esters and the reversible binding of benzodiazepines.", 
    "30": "The above results with intracerebral drug injection and electrical brain stimulation in rats indicate that enhancement of GABAergic activity in the dorsal CG or in the MH raises the threshold of electrical stimulation inducing aversive behavior when applied to these brain areas. Conversely, drug-induced reduction of GABA action in the dorsal CG or in the MH leads to aversive-like behavioral changes. Therefore, GABAergic fibers seem to exert tonic inhibition on neuronal groups in the CG and MH integrating aversive behavioral states. Anxiolytics may cause anti-aversive effects by enhancing this GABAergic modulation. As discussed elsewhere, serotonergic and opioid mechanisms are also likely to operate in periventricular brain areas. In conjunction with GABAergic mechanisms, they may be involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety, panic attacks and pain, as well as in the therapeutic action of anxiolytics, anti-panic drugs and centrally-acting analgesics.", 
    "31": "A total of 192 patients suffering from mild to moderate depression, with or without anxiety, accompanied by one or more specific somatic symptoms, was entered into a double-blind, multi-centre trial to compare flupenthixol and diazepam as treatments for psychosomatic syndromes in general practice. Each patient was treated for 4 weeks and assessed after 1, 2 and 4 weeks on the Hamilton Depression Scale, with visual analogue scales of depression and somatic symptoms, by global assessments (psychological and somatic symptoms) and on a side-effects scale. The principal somatic symptoms were tension headache (69 patients), epigastric discomfort (59 patients), chest pain (39 patients) and backache (25 patients). There were 9 drop-outs (2 on flupenthixol and 7 on diazepam), of whom 5 (2 on flupenthixol and 3 on diazepam) who were treated for at least 2 weeks were included in the analysis of results. All patients received 1 tablet a day (0.5 mg flupenthixol or 2.5 mg diazepam) for the first week. Thereafter, all except 5 patients (3 on flupenthixol and 2 on diazepam) had their dose doubled for the remaining 3 weeks of study. Both drugs were effective in producing consistent improvement in all four somatic symptom groups in terms of both depression and somatic symptoms over the 4 weeks of study. There was a trend throughout in favour of flupenthixol as the more therapeutically effective. Flupenthixol was significantly more effective in relieving depressive symptoms and somatic symptoms in all four somatic symptom groups considered together. It was also superior to diazepam as measured by its effect on the depression sub-scales, anxiety, agitated depression, retarded depression and melancholia. Both drugs were well tolerated, although diazepam-treated patients showed a moderate increase in side-effects scores initially, while the scores in patients treated with flupenthixol decreased consistently over all 4 weeks of the trial. It is concluded from this study that flupenthixol has an important place in the management of patients with psychosomatic illness.", 
    "32": "Eighteen newborns (gestational age 28 to 42 weeks and post-natal age 0.5 to 44 days) suffering from convulsions not controlled by phenobarbital were treated with clonazepam 0.1 mg/kg (8 cases) or 0.2 mg/kg (10 cases) administered by slow intravenous infusion. The plasma half-lives in these \"phenobarbital pretreated neonates' were of the same order of magnitude as those reported in adults (20-43 h). Post-natal age did affect clearance, which was 50-70% less than in adults and older children. At the end of the infusion period, plasma clonazepam ranged from 28 to 117 ng/ml in the 0.1 mg/kg group and from 99 to 380 ng/ml in the 0.2 mg/kg group. In the former an immediate therapeutic response was observed in 7 out of 8 cases, and in the latter a significant and somehow delayed effect on convulsion was present only in 6 cases. The data suggest that optimal therapeutic response might already have been achieved with the 0.1 mg/kg dose. Higher doses and toxic concentrations of clonazepam may be detrimental to complete control of seizures and may expose the newborn to an unnecessary risk of adverse events.", 
    "33": "In this paper we describe one hardware and two software automated sleep spindle detection methods, used in our laboratory. With each of the three methods at least 500 polygraphic sleep recordings were analyzed and the results compared with the outcome of the visual analysis. In this way we were able to evaluate the advantages and the disadvantages of each of the three methods and also to discuss the practical application of this method for clinical and scientific purposes, as for example a better quantification of the variation in sleep spindle density under influence of the intake of benzodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "34": "Bumetanide binding to human serum albumin was studied using ultrafiltration. The first stoichiometric binding constant for bumetanide is 6.4 X 10(4) M-1. Bumetanide competes with bilirubin for human serum albumin binding, having a KDispl (displacement constant) of 6.2 X 10(3) M-1 measured by the peroxidase method. This displacement effect is also observed using pooled umbilical cord serum and pooled adult serum employing a dialysis rate method. Bumetanide competes to a lesser degree with diazepam binding to human serum albumin. No competition with diazepam occurs using umbilical cord or adult serum. Pharmacologic concentrations of bumetanide would not significantly affect bilirubin-albumin binding and should not increase the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in newborn infants.",

    "36": "Gallamine inhibited the binding of both (3H)N-Methylscopolamine ((3H)NMS) and (3H)Pirenzepine ((3H)PZ) in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex of rat brain. Competition curves between gallamine and (3H)PZ suggested that gallamine recognized an homogeneous class of receptors (Hill coefficient close to 1) whereas competition curves, using (3H)NMS as tracer, were compatible with two classes of gallamine receptors (Hill coefficient below 0.7). The latter phenomenon could be explained, at least partially, by the inhibitory effect exerted by gallamine on the k off of (3H)NMS. This effect was already observed at a 10 microM gallamine concentration and reached 100% at 1 mM (a gallamine concentration reducing the k off of (3H)PZ by 30% only). The nature of the radioligand rather than the relative abundance of M1 - M2 receptors was probably responsible for this discrepancy. Gallamine inhibited the (3H)NMS dissociation rate from brain M1 and M2 receptors (i.e. receptors with high and intermediate affinity for pirenzepine) with a lower potency than from cardiac M2 receptors (i.e. receptors with low affinity for pirenzepine).", 
    "37": "A modified x-ray method was applied in 41 patients with peptic ulcer of the duodenum to study twice (without gastrozepin intake and after its administration in courses) the rate of evacuation from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of radiographic contrast capsules taken with a trial meal. Administration of gastrozepin in courses significantly decelerated the rate of evacuation of the radiographic contrast capsules from the GIT with an initially accelerated evacuatory function of the GIT and slightly accelerated GIT evacuation with an initially decelerated evacuatory function.", 
    "38": "The inhibitory effects of atropine and pirenzepine (nonselective and M1-selective antagonists, respectively) on the contractile responses of the epididymal half of the rat vas deferens to methacholine included a depression of the maximal response. In the presence of pirenzepine, atropine was a competitive antagonist of the responses to methacholine. However in the presence of atropine, pirenzepine remained a non-competitive inhibitor of the response. It is suggested that low concentrations of methacholine predominantly stimulate M2-receptors and that at high concentrations, methacholine also stimulates M1-receptors.", 
    "39": "The degradation of clonazepam (CZP) in serum during exposure to light can markedly decrease the concentration of the drug. Decay of CZP was studied after exposure to artificial UV light, sunlight, and room light. Serum was extracted with diethylether at pH 9.1. A reversed-phase (RP-8) column was used, with acetonitrile and water as the mobile phase. CZP was detected at 320 nm. The linearity of this high performance liquid chromatographic method is guaranteed to at least 700 nM. The recovery of CZP was 93%, and the day-to-day coefficients of variation were 7.7% (at 75.0 nM) and 6.0% (at 211.4 nM), respectively.", 
    "40": "A convenient and sensitive high performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for determination of clonazepam in serum using a C-18 reverse-phase column, and mobile phase consisting of a 50:35:15 mixture by volume of pH 6.0 phosphate buffer:methanol:acetonitrile. Quantitation was performed at 313 nm with flunitrazepam as the internal standard. Using 1 ml of serum for extraction, the assay is linear for clonazepam concentrations between 10 and 250 ng/ml. The relative recovery averaged 100.3%, and the coefficient of variation for between-day and within-day assays was less than 7%. A simple modification permits analysis of 200 microliter of serum, with little loss of precision and with a detection limit of 20 ng/ml. Only three drugs tested (nitrazepam, methaqualone, and norchlordiazepoxide) interfered with the assay, and none are likely to be used therapeutically with clonazepam. Importantly, carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide do not interfere under the conditions of the assay. The method is equally suitable for the determination of nitrazepam. By adjusting the mobile phase so that volume ratios of phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile are 45:35:20, and using nitrazepam as the internal standard, seven other benzodiazepines (demoxepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide, norchlordiazepoxide, temazepam, diazepam, and nordiazepam) can be resolved at 254 nm.", 
    "41": "Pony stallions were given sexual behavior trials in experimental \"home\" and \"novel\" environments, similar in all major features except location. In the novel environment, erection latency was increased and erection time decreased. Treatment with an anxiolytic benzodiazepine derivative (diazepam) appeared to block these effects.", 
    "42": "Rats moved to novel environments for a 20 minute period showed increased plasma corticosterone levels--the greater the difference between the housing context and the novel environment, the greater the increase in corticosterone. Plasma glucose levels (PGL) also increased with increasing environmental novelty and these PGL changes were moderated by pretreatment with chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg). The increases in corticosterone and PGL were greater in a context previously shown to lead to hyperglycemic conditioning following insulin administration than in a context previously shown to lead to hypoglycemic conditioning. These results imply that the directionality of glycemic conditioning may be related to the initial stressfulness of the conditioning environment.", 
    "43": "We report a case of prolonged coma (7 days) which arose as a complication of the treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures and delirium with intravenous phenobarbital and diazepam. In an attempt to enhance the elimination of diazepam and its active metabolites, as well as phenobarbital, 40 grams activated charcoal was given every 4 hours (6 doses). Coma was completely reversed within 12 hours; serum half life (t1/2) of diazepam was reduced from 195 to 18 hours during charcoal administration. We postulate that higher free (unbound) diazepam concentrations secondary to hypoalbuminemia, occurring as a result of liver disease, may have increased the depth of our patient's coma, but paradoxically, by making more drug available for diffusion across the gastrointestinal membrane barrier, may have enhanced the ability of activated charcoal to adsorb diazepam and, therefore, decrease its t1/2.", 
    "44": "The serum protein binding of sulfisoxazole (sulfafurazole, INN) and diazepam, drugs that bind to the two main binding sites for acidic drugs on albumin, has been studied in young smokers and non-smokers. No differences between the two groups could be detected with regard to the serum protein binding of either drug. Thiocyanate, present in relatively large amounts in the serum of smokers, does not seem to affect the drug-binding properties of serum proteins.", 
    "45": "The effects of triazolam on immediate and delayed recall were evaluated in a double-blind placebo controlled study in 22 normal volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive triazolam or a placebo as a single dose administered at bedtime. Immediate and delayed recall are tested using a modified version of the \"Williams Word Memory Task\" before and at .5, 8, and 14 hours after drug administration. Delayed recall was evaluated at the 14 hour time point for words recalled at the pre drug and 1/2 and 8 hour time points. No significant difference was noted between the triazolam and placebo group with regard to their immediate recall ability at any of the time points. The placebo group demonstrated no decrease in their delayed recall ability during any of the various post drug time points. However, when evaluating delayed recall in the triazolam group, a statistically significant (p less than .05) decrease compared to baseline in their recall ability of words remembered at the .5 and 8 hour time points was noted. This study suggests that triazolam's amnestic effect may extend beyond the duration of its generally accepted hypnotic efficacy. This is consistent with the hypothesis that amnestic potency among the benzodiazepines is related to benzodiazepine receptor binding affinity and lipophilicity.", 
    "46": "Atonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, tonic seizures, and infantile spasms are among the most difficult to control in children. Certain 1,4-benzodiazepines may be effective against these seizure types. Thus, clonazepam has been shown to reduce the frequency of absence, atypical absence, myoclonic, atonic, and complex partial seizures in children. Furthermore, both clonazepam and nitrazepam have been shown to be effective in the treatment of infantile spasms. However, their usefulness is limited by a deleterious effect on neurologic function, particularly on cognition. Controlled studies in animals and in adult patients and volunteers have demonstrated that clobazam has less neurotoxicity than 1,4-benzodiazepines and, in addition, may possess a psychotropic effect. Uncontrolled studies of clobazam in children suggest that this drug may be effective in the treatment of partial seizures, startle-induced seizures, infantile spasms, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We studied the effect of clobazam in children whose seizures were resistant to most other antiepileptic drugs. Mental retardation was present in 80% of the children, and 62.5% had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Tolerance to clobazam developed in approximately one-third of patients, but this was frequently only partial and often responded to an increase in dosage. Of 50 children studied for a minimum of 3 months, seizures were controlled completely in 10 and frequency of seizures was reduced by more than 50% in a further 17. In most cases, parents observed a striking improvement in neurologic function, particularly in alertness, concentration, and balance. Thus, clobazam may be of value in the treatment of those seizures which are most difficult to control in children.", 
    "47": "Preliminary studies of patients who had brain damage, intractable epilepsy, and mental subnormality showed that clobazam in small doses (20 to 30 mg/day) was beneficial, and indicated that a more detailed investigation was worthwhile. In this study, 30 patients were followed up for at least 18 months in a continuing open-ended study. Fit frequency was found to be markedly reduced, few side effects have occurred, and the visual analogue scales and the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire have shown improvement. \"Breakthrough\" has not been a problem at the dose level of 20 to 30 mg/day when given in addition to conventional anticonvulsant regimes, usually carbamazepine, phenytoin, or valproate. In the meanwhile, other psychosocial problems (for example, employment and marital problems) have improved. It therefore seems that clobazam is a useful additional drug in conventional anticonvulsant regimes.", 
    "48": "Sixteen patients with status epilepticus (SE) and 13 patients suffering from startle-induced epilepsy were treated with clobazam (CLB). Status epilepticus was of the absence (six cases), myoclonic-absence (one case) myoclonic (one case), tonic (one case), and single or complex partial (seven cases) type. In all patients, consciousness was sufficiently retained during SE to allow CLB ingestion. Clobazam was administered in a single oral dose (0.5 to 1.70 mg/kg, mean 1.08 mg/kg) under electroencephalographic monitoring. In all patients but one, SE terminated within 15 to 31 min (mean 24.4 min) after CLB administration without significant side effects. Treatment of SE depends on the clinical context and type of SE. We conclude that CLB is a useful drug in the management of some forms of SE. In 13 patients suffering from startle-induced epileptic seizures, CLB was added to the previous ineffective treatment protocol. Of these 13 patients, 15.4% were completely unresponsive, 23.1% experienced drug resistance, and 61.5% achieved a good control (91.5% reduction of the reflex seizures) for a mean of 22.7 months. Drowsiness was observed in four patients, whereas favorable side-effects were observed in four patients.", 
    "49": "The dipeptide gamma-L-glutamyl-taurine (Litoralon) reduced neophobia of rats at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg (i.p.) in a \"one-bottle forced choice paradigm\" for conditioned taste aversion (CTA), but did not significantly affect the rats' \"memory\" of intoxication following chronic treatment at doses of 0.05, 0.50 and 5.00 mg/kg (i.p.). Acute treatment with Litoralon (10-1000 micrograms/kg, i.p.) did not affect CTA checked in a \"two-bottle test\", when administered immediately following the unconditioned stimulus (LiCl injection). In contrast, when given 90 min prior to the retention test, the injection of Litoralon (50.0 micrograms/kg) and gamma-aminobutyryl ethanolamine phosphate (100 and 500 micrograms/kg) resulted in a significantly higher intake of saccharin solution by the rats. This effect is comparable to the action of diazepam tested in the same experimental procedure. The results support our hypothesis about the anti-conflict potencies of these dipeptides, exerted by reducing aversion of phobia and/or the anxiety level of the animals in the experimental situation.", 
    "50": "Picrotoxin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and a high dose of diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the concentration of plasma corticosterone in nonstressed rats. This effect of diazepam was unaffected by picrotoxin and bicuculline (GABA-A receptor blockers), atropine (a muscarinic receptor blocker), apomorphine (a dopamine receptor agonist), haloperidol (a dopamine receptor blocker) and yohimbine (an alpha-2-adrenergic receptor blocker); but was blocked by clonidine (an alpha-2-receptor agonist) and this effect of clonidine was reversed by yohimbine. Diazepam was unable to elevate plasma corticosterone levels in rats pretreated with dexamethasone. Clonidine and the GABA-B receptor agonist, baclofen, failed to affect the picrotoxin-induced rise of plasma corticosterone, but this rise was abolished by a low dose of diazepam (1 mg/kg). The results suggest that the diazepam-induced enhancement of ACTH release, presumably mediated by blockade of alpha-2-adrenergic receptors, is responsible for the observed increase of plasma corticosterone level in rats. On the other hand, the elevation of plasma corticosterone induced by picrotoxin appears to be mediated by GABA-A receptors.", 
    "51": "The cerebrovascular consequences of the gentle restraint commonly used for the measurement of local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) in conscious rats has been tested by using two drugs, propranolol and diazepam. Propranolol induced small LCBF decreases in 7 structures suggesting that the cerebral circulation was partially controlled by the activation of intra or extracerebral aminergic pathways in this protocol. Sedative doses of diazepam reduced LCBF in most of the structures but anxiolytic doses increased it in 4 structures. This effect may be due to a regionally differentiated modification of activity in the brain due to the selective inhibition of limbic structures by diazepam. Since propranolol and diazepam induced only small changes, the LCBF of gently restrained rats appeared to be minimally affected by the stressful situation imposed by the protocol.", 
    "52": "A new type of anxiety state has recently been identified: the panic attack. This condition is qualitatively distinct from other anxiety disturbances and its treatment is different. Sodium lactate seems to play an essential role in the triggering of panic attacks through the intermediary of catabolic, physicochemical mechanisms or by alteration of adrenergic neurotransmission. Anxiety may be autonomised into two sub-groups, based on the effects of psychotropic drugs: phobic and anxiety states. The presence or absence of panic attacks is essential as it has diagnostic and therapeutic implications: M.A.D.I. or tricyclic antidepressors have a specific action on panic attacks but are ineffective on anticipatory, chronic, phobic or other forms of anxiety. Which are improved by benzodiazepines which; themselves, have very little effect on panic attacks.", 
    "53": "The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was conducted in 194 patients. Criteria of the DST estimation included the degree of suppression of 1-HOCS and the post-dexamethasone levels of HOCS. The results of the DST were correlated with the efficacy of the subsequent therapy. The test evidenced pathology in 79% of patients with the preliminary diagnosis of \"endogenous depression\" and in 94.5% of those patients of this group who were later successfully treated with antidepressants. In patients showing some response to anxiolytics the DST was abnormal in 40%. In 37 patients with anxiety depression the DST was combined with the diazepam test. The results permitted reliable differentiation between \"endogenic depression with anxiety\" and \"endogenic anxiety with a depressive mood\" and the prognosis. In cases of reactive depression the DST was abnormal only in 12% of patients. Both criteria of the DST assessment are compared, and the percentage of suppression is considered as preferable.", 
    "54": "The prenatal treatment of diazepam on the developmental pattern of brain ornithine decarboxylase and the general growth of offspring were studied. Diazepam (120 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats from day 14 to day 20 of gestation. The activity of brain ornithine decarboxylase and body weight of the offspring were measured from the late fetal stage to the early postnatal stage. It was found that diazepam inhibited both the prenatal and 4-hour postnatal ornithine decarboxylase activities, though the general maturation pattern of the enzyme in the brain was not much altered. It may indicate that diazepam inhibits early brain development. The enzyme activity fell off as it reached maturation. Prenatal treated neonates of 6-hour or older age group had the normal activities of brain ornithine decarboxylase. The general growth of the treated offspring was substantially retarded. Their body weights were very much lower than the control offspring. The results of the present study is an additional evidence that diazepam and other benzodiazepines should be used with great care in pregnant women.", 
    "55": "The binding of ethacrynic acid to human serum albumin was investigated by means of circular dichroism and equilibrium dialysis measurements, using native human serum albumin and albumin derivatives with chemical modifications impairing specifically drug binding to the indole and benzodiazepine binding site or the azapropazone-warfarin binding area, respectively. The data presented indicate that the high-affinity binding of ethacrynic acid to human serum albumin is mediated by these two important drug binding sites. Accordingly, even at relatively low concentrations ethacrynic acid displaces other drugs from both binding sites.", 
    "56": "Neuropathological and biochemical effects of neonatal exposure to the alkyl metal triethyltin were examined in juvenile male Long Evans rats. Rats were injected intraperitoneally on postnatal day 5 with 6 mg/kg of triethyltin bromide and sampled on day 20. The brains of tin-treated animals weighed significantly less than either saline or starved controls and exhibited a marked caviation of the ventrolateral surfaces. Histologically, neuronal necrosis was noted in the entorhinal and transitional cortex, an observation confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of astrocytes. Hippocampal involvement was further evidenced by a protrusion of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and an abnormal histochemical staining pattern of acetylcholinesterase in this layer. Sections stained by the Timm's method for the deposition of heavy metals showed a marked reduction in the staining of the hippocampal CA4,3,2 sectors and an absence of stained laminae in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Receptor binding assays indicated a selective depression of the benzodiazepine receptor in the hippocampus of tin-treated pups compared to starved controls. Taken in concert, these data indicate that neonatal exposure to triethyltin produces severe neuronal damage in the posterior cortex and a derangement of hippocampal afferent circuitry.", 
    "57": "We have developed an HPLC technique which is precise, rapid and reliable. Sample preparation involves simple alkaline extraction into an organic solvent mixture. Trazodone elutes at 3.2 min in this reverse phase system. There is no requirement for elevated column temperature. The method is linear to 3000 ng/ml. The availability of a technique which is transferrable to the clinical laboratory may help to define the proper role of therapeutic monitoring of trazodone.", 
    "58": "The effects of the benzamide cisapride (C) (8 mg) i.v. have been compared to placebo (P) in a double blind randomised study. The effects on gastric emptying, the absorption and effects of oral diazepam, and BP and pulse were observed. Cisapride increased the rate of gastric emptying of 500 ml liquid containing diazepam 10 mg (t 1/2 C: 7.4 min, P: 14.9 min). The initial rate of absorption of diazepam contained in the drink was increased by C (AUC 0-1 h C: 328 micrograms h l-1, P: 253 micrograms h l-1, but there was no change in overall bioavailability. This change in diazepam kinetics was associated with a significantly greater impairment in reaction time in the first 45 min after drinking but not in self rated sedation. Cisapride produced a significant tachycardia (e.g. after 10 min C: 82 beats/min, P: 69 beats/min) which probably reflects a peripheral vasodilator action. Cisapride may therefore alter the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of concurrently administered drugs.", 
    "59": "The metabolism of acetaminophen and oxazepam in humans is mainly dependent on the microsomal capacity for glucuronide conjugation. The clearance of acetaminophen and the formation of metabolites were evaluated in 7 patients before and during concomitant administration of oxazepam 30 mg. The subjects received a single 500 mg dose of acetaminophen i.v. and concentrations in plasma were measured for 360 minutes and in urine for 24 h in order to estimate the production of metabolites. The single therapeutic dose of oxazepam had no effect on the clearance of acetaminophen or on formation of its metabolites.", 
    "60": "The effects of alprazolam 0.5 mg and lorazepam 2 mg on cognitive and psychomotor skills were assessed in twelve normal volunteer subjects in a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Single and multiple dose effects were monitored using a battery of tests comprising critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT), choice reaction time (CRT), simulated car tracking, and subjective ratings of perceived sedation (LARS) and of sleep behaviour (LSEQ). Compared with placebo baseline scores, treatment with lorazepam 2 mg (both single and multiple doses) resulted in a widespread impairment of CRT, tracking accuracy, and CFFT. Single doses of alprazolam 0.5 mg reduced CFFT with respect to the placebo baseline. Single and multiple dose treatment with both drugs resulted in subjective reports of sedation, a reduction of sleep onset latency, and improved sleep quality. Only lorazepam 2 mg significantly disrupted the integrity of behaviour on waking from sleep. These results suggest important pharmacodynamic differences between the two drugs in the doses used.", 
    "61": "To determine the optimum dosage schedule for intermittent rectal diazepam in suppository form for the prevention of recurrent febrile convulsions, we studied the pharmacokinetics of diazepam administered in repeated rectal doses. The plasma concentration-time data for diazepam on twice repeated rectal dosing with 0.5 mg/kg at 8-hour intervals in six infants showed that therapeutic plasma levels could be attained within 30 minutes and maintained for the first 24 hours. Most of the observed plasma diazepam levels were found to be within +/- one standard deviation of the values calculated from the pharmacokinetic parameters in six other infants with single rectal dosing. Computer-simulated plasma level profile suggested that plasma diazepam levels may reach the toxic range after administration of five or more doses. Twice repeated rectal dosing with 0.5 mg/kg of diazepam in suppository form at 8-hour intervals during the febrile period may be a rational approach for the prevention of recurrent febrile convulsions.", 
    "62": "Alpha male rats from mixed sex colony groups were tested for aggressiveness toward nonaggressive male intruders. Afterward, they were castrated and implanted with testosterone filled Silastic tubes, castrated and implanted with empty tubes, or sham castrated and implanted with empty tubes. There were significant declines in the aggressiveness (lateral attacks, bites, and piloerection but not on-top) of castrated rats without testosterone replacement but not in castrated rats with testosterone replacement. At a second operation, castrated animals had their testosterone capsules removed or had their empty capsules replaced with testosterone filled capsules. When tested for aggression toward nonaggressive intruders, those alpha males which had testosterone removed declined in aggressiveness while those which had it implanted returned to a level of aggressiveness close to that emitted by sham castrated control animals. Subordinate males became dominant when alpha males were castrated and not given testosterone replacement. In a final series of observations, sham castrated males were found to be more aggressive than castrated males when pitted against one another. It is argued that testosterone plays a primary role in intermale social aggression and that the decline in aggressiveness following castration is typically accompanied by a loss of social dominance.", 
    "63": "The neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an under-recognized yet sometimes fatal complication of antipsychotic drug therapy. NMS is comprised of hyperthermia, rigidity, autonomic disturbances, and altered consciousness. Until recently, there was no specific therapy for NMS other than discontinuing the offending neuroleptic and providing symptomatic treatment. However, 4 drugs (dantrolene and the dopamine agonists amantadine, bromocriptine, and carbidopa/levodopa) have clearly emerged to merit consideration in the therapy of NMS. The literature on their use in this disorder, either alone or in combination, is reviewed. The combination of dantrolene (a peripheral muscle relaxant) and post-synaptic dopamine agonists may prove the most effective in this condition.", 
    "64": "Effects of tizanidine were studied with special reference to the effect on motor systems. The drug effectively reduced the intercollicular decerebrate rigidity and gamma-activity indirectly recorded from muscle spindle afferent discharges without showing the direct inhibitory effect on muscle spindles in rats. The drug dose-dependently inhibited the phasic responses of alpha-rigidity in anemic decerebrate rats without showing marked inhibition of the tonic response. Tizanidine effectively depressed the crossed extensor reflex in chicks and depressed mono- and polysynaptic reflex potentials in rats; dorsal root reflex was increased transiently. Tizanidine had no effect on the neuromuscular junction in rats and [3H]diazepam binding in rat brain membrane. It is suggested that the depression by tizanidine of gamma-system and spinal reflexes contribute to muscle relaxation and anti-spastic effects and that mechanisms of action are different from those of other centrally acting muscle relaxants such as mephenesin and benzodiazepines.", 
    "65": "A multi-centre, randomized double-blind parallel study was carried out to compare the efficacy and tolerance of a single daily dose of controlled-release (CR) capsules of diazepam (10 mg and 15 mg) with placebo under conditions close to those of general practice. All patients between 16 and 60 years of age, presenting an anxiety syndrome as a result of neurotic disturbance, for whom benzodiazepine treatment was indicated for at least 3 weeks, were accepted for the study. The results from 231 patients (119 on placebo, 55 on 10 mg and 57 on 15 mg diazepam) were analyzed after 1 and 3 weeks of treatment. Complaints were found to have improved after 1 week and 3 weeks in the controlled-release diazepam groups whereas the corresponding results with placebo were clearly less favourable. After 1 week, and even more strikingly after 3 weeks, evaluation of the general effects of treatment showed better results with diazepam than with placebo. The obviously higher rate of drop-outs on placebo confirmed its less reliable effect. The controlled-release capsules were well tolerated and notably better than placebo. The most frequent side-effect reported on diazepam was fatigue, and this was probably due to a relative overdosage from use of a standardized dose throughout treatment. Other reported side-effects could not definitely be ascribed to the drug. At the end of a week, successful results were achieved in 48.2% of the patients on controlled-release diazepam compared with only 14.3% of those on placebo. After 3 weeks, these figures were 73.2% and 30.3%, respectively.", 
    "66": "The N1 and P2 components of the auditory evoked magnetic field were shown to be modified by the benzodiazepines diazepam and triazolam. Previous studies indicate that the electrical sources of these components are located in the auditory cortex, implying that benzodiazepines have a direct or indirect effect on neuronal activity at this level. The recorded changes were comparable to those previously reported using auditory evoked potential measurements. These results suggest that magnetic recordings may eventually be used as a sensitive, supplementary and location-specific measure of the central action of psychoactive substances.", 
    "67": "The effects of 10 mg diazepam on signal detection theory measures (stimulus sensitivity, response bias) and reaction times were studied in a 1-hour visual signal detection task with high and low signal probability, and on performance in two short-duration tasks: Critical Flicker-Fusion Frequency (CFF) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). 12 healthy volunteers participated in this placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study. Diazepam affected the stimulus sensitivity and the reaction times of hits in the signal detection task. DSST performance was also impaired while CFF did not change after diazepam treatment. No relationship between serum diazepam concentration and change in task performance was found. It is concluded that diazepam affects signal detection performance, independent of signal probability. A short-duration task like the DSST is as sensitive to the effects of diazepam as the (long-duration) signal detection task.", 
    "68": "The sleep-wakefulness (S-W) patterns in 4 genetically epileptic beagles were studied. As compared to normal beagles, there was no change in the percentage time spent in the different stages of S-W. However, epileptic dogs tended towards more and shorter S-W epochs and they had a statistically significant shortening of both REM and deep slow wave sleep (dSWS) latency. The antiepileptics diazepam, phenytoin, flunarizine and phenobarbital did not yield marked effects on S-W patterns, but the REM and dSWS latencies were affected. It is suggested that epileptic beagles may be useful in experimental analysis of epilepsy as well as in drug development.", 
    "69": "The present study was carried out in order to verify whether, in benzodiazepine-medicated healthy volunteers, oxiracetam retained the properties already observed after administration in normal volunteers. In a cross-over study, 12 volunteers, medicated the night before with 5 mg diazepam, were i.v. treated with 1 g oxiracetam or saline. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed before, and 15 and 120 min after, nootropic or saline injection. Computerized examination of the EEG traces showed an increase of the alpha- and a decrease of the delta-relative activities, particularly in the fronto-temporal regions. These preliminary results suggest that oxiracetam might be useful in benzodiazepine-treated patients by improving their cognitive activities without nullifying the sedation of anxiety and neurotic behavior.", 
    "70": "Changes of plasma cortisol, prolactin and thyroxine levels as a result of surgical stress were examined in 11 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. General anaesthesia was induced with the new benzodiazepine derivative midazolam (0.25 +/- 0.04 mg/kg) and maintained by nitrous oxide in oxygen. Plasma cortisol and thyroxine levels slightly decreased at the induction of anaesthesia and the beginning of surgery, while the prolactin level increased. By the end of surgery the cortisol and prolactin concentrations increased significantly, although the thyroxine level had barely changed. The highest hormone values were observed a few hours after the operation, but on the next morning hormone levels approached the normal range. On the basis of these results anaesthesia induction with midazolam can be said to have favourably affected the unwanted degree of hormonal changes related to surgery.", 
    "71": "Chronic implantation of 4 bipolar concentric electrodes into frontal cortex, thalamus, striatum and reticular formation allowed repeated recordings of field potentials from freely moving rats. After radiotransmission the signals were quantitatively evaluated by spectral power analysis. The power in particular frequency bands changed in the presence of drugs in a characteristic manner and allowed us to describe the central action of analgesics in comparison with diazepam and phenobarbital. Analysis of the data showed that the action of diazepam was mainly confined to alpha 1 and beta 2 frequencies whereas tramadol acted predominantly on the theta and alpha range. Buprenorphine and morphine most consistently influenced the alpha 2 frequencies. Whereas buprenorphine and tramadol (2 opiate drugs) showed a striking similarity to the action of morphine in corresponding brain areas the minor tranquilizer diazepam and the anticonvulsive phenobarbital could clearly be separated from them. Flupirtine, a new analgesic not suspected of an opiate-like action profile, did not resemble any of them and thus could be confirmed to have a different mode of action.", 
    "72": "Three muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes may be defined on the basis of functional and binding studies using selective antagonists. The subtypes may be solubilized in a stable form in digitonin. In solution, the subclasses still exhibit different structure-binding relationships but these have been perturbed by solubilization. The binding of the selective antagonist, pirenzepine, to the purified cortical receptor is complex and similar to that found in membranes. The muscarinic receptor subclasses thus appear to be different molecular entities. Possible explanations for the molecular heterogeneity are discussed. It has also been possible to solubilize receptor-GTP binding protein complexes which have higher sedimentation coefficients (13.4 S) than the apparently monomeric receptor (11.6 S)."
