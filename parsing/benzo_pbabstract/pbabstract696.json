The conclusion reached is that use of major tranquilizers may be needed to keep hysterical symptomatology under control while diagnostic investigation is proceeding and, if the diagnostic studies are negative, may be used to help ameliorate symptoms in patients unwilling to see a psychiatrist.", 
    "1": "A group of 20 pregnant women requesting therapeutic abortion received a single transcervical intrauterine instillation of 5 mg prostaglandin F2alpha in 5 ml of saline between 38 and 46 days after the onset of their last menses. Of the 20 women, 13 (65%) had a successful termination of pregnancy, while the other 7 patients did not abort. A total of 7 patients, 2 of whom aborted, had severe adverse reactions, including fever, hemorrhage and hypertension. 3 of the 5 women who did not abort developed septic incomplete abortions. The low incidence of success and high incidence of complications noted in the study indicate that this method should not be utilized to terminate early pregnancy.", 
    "2": "Routine estimation of serum phenytoin levels in patients newly admitted to a Special Centre for Epilepsy showed that 40% of those receiving sulthiame in addition to phenytoin had levels in the toxic range. Four long-stay patients became drug intoxicated when sulthiame treatment was started. Sulthiame appears to inhibit the hepatic hydroxylation of phenytoin.", 
    "3": "Intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and muscle relaxants were first used in Cape Town in 1958 in an attempt to reduce the mortality from tetanus neonatorum, which was then over 90%. Problems of effective ventilation, of tracheostomy, and of infection in the neonate were gradually overcome so that between 1967 and 1972 the mortality in 186 cases was 21%. In a consecutive series of 97 cases the mortality was 10%."
