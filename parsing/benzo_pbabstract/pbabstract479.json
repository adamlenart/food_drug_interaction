    "0": "Characteristic findings in blink reflex are reported in a 55-year-old female with periodic ataxia. The blink reflexes on the side ipsilateral to the stimulation consisted of four components with latencies of 11, 21, 35 and 47 ms, instead of the usual two components seen in normal subjects. On the contralateral side, the last three components were also present. The second component was different from the normal R2 response in that its latency was shorter than normal and it did not habituate by stimulation at a rate of 10 Hz. In addition, it was more affected by diazepam than the third or fourth components. It is considered that R2 may have consisted of three components and that a shorter latency of the second component could be explained by facilitation.", 
    "1": "Two benzodiazepine compounds, midazolam and diazepam, were administered as adjunctive treatment to soman-exposed rhesus monkeys to evaluate their effects on acute soman intoxication. Monkeys were pretreated orally with pyridostigmine, exposed to soman, and treated i.m. with atropine, pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), and with midazolam, diazepam or sterile water (control). All monkeys that received the benzodiazepines recovered sooner and exhibited no convulsions. Neuronal degenerative and necrotic lesions were decreased or eliminated in the entorhinal cortex, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus of those animals that received benzodiazepine therapy. These findings support the continued evaluation of drugs with anticonvulsant activity as standard adjunct therapy for soman intoxication.", 
    "2": "Blood samples were drawn from each of 99 chronic insomniacs twice during washout (days -20 and -6) and six times during the study (mornings after study nights -1, 1, 2, 7, 13, and 14) to examine the relationship between morning-after drug plasma levels, sleep efficiency, next-day mood, and performance. Patients in the four treatment groups received either flurazepam 30 mg, flurazepam 15 mg, midazolam 15 mg, or placebo. Plasma drug concentrations of N-desalkylflurazepam and midazolam were measured by electron-capture gas chromatography. Values of midazolam during the 14-day study were at or near the sensitivity limit of the assay and were not used in the calculations. Levels of N-desalkylflurazepam increased as expected during the 14 days. Mean level for the high-dose flurazepam group was approximately twice that of the low-dose group. The main consistency in the correlations, which were found on days 13 and 14, was that the high-dose desalkylflurazepam concentrations had a negative correlation with two independent measures of sleep latency. However, otherwise there was little or no relationship between N-desalkylflurazepam levels and sleep efficiency or next-day behavior. Issues of tolerance, individual variability in baseline and response, and their contribution to the findings are discussed.", 
    "3": "The 99 chronic insomniacs examined in the present multicenter study were given three cognitive tasks (reading comprehension, addition, and digit symbol substitution test [DSST]) as well as the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in order to evaluate the effects of flurazepam (Dalmane) 15 and 30 mg, midazolam 15 mg, and placebo on cognitive performance and mood. Subjective evaluation of performance was also obtained. A significant person in the patient's life was also asked to evaluate the patient's mood before and during the 14-day treatment interval. After a 20-day washout, next-day performance and mood were evaluated after placebo nights -1 and 0 (baseline) and after treatment nights 1, 2 (early interval), 7 (middle interval), and 13 and 14 (late interval). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on changes from baseline indicated no significant between-groups treatment effects for reading comprehension or any of the mood variables at any interval. Patients on flurazepam 30 mg performed less well compared with other groups even though, after completion of the tasks, this group believed that they performed as well as those on the other regimens. Performances by flurazepam 15 mg, midazolam, and placebo groups were similar. Significant others tended to rate high-dose flurazepam patients more negatively. High-dose flurazepam patients had a significant change on the DSST and addition tasks due to treatment after the first night, and change in performance remained significantly impaired for the DSST task relative to that of the other groups thereafter.", 
    "4": "Four skills performance (psychomotor) tasks, including simple and choice reaction time, divided attention, and vigilance, were given to 99 chronic insomniacs to determine whether the use of midazolam 15 mg, or of flurazepam 15 or 30 mg, compared with placebo would produce next-day impairment throughout a 14-day treatment period. Tests were administered during 2 baseline days and on treatment days 1 and 2 (early interval), 7 (middle interval) and 13 and 14 (late interval). Compared with placebo, performance on all four tasks was impaired by flurazepam 30 mg. The deficits associated with flurazepam 15 mg were roughly half the magnitude of those produced by flurazepam 30 mg, but these changes did not reach statistical significance for single response measures at single time intervals. Midazolam showed no consistent pattern of performance effects; however, for divided attention tracking error, there was a significant decrement. The placebo group showed flat performance curves or improved performance as a result of learning (practice effect).", 
    "5": "This article contains the sleep results of the efficacy study of flurazepam 30 mg and 15 mg, midazolam 15 mg, and placebo in the 99 chronic insomniacs studied as part of this multicenter study. After a 20-day drug washout, all-night sleep was recorded on 2 baseline nights, on the first 2 treatment nights, on treatment night 7, and on the last 2 nights of the study (nights 13 and 14). To reduce the number of comparisons, electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep latency, EEG wake time, EEG sleep efficiency, post-sleep questionnaire (PSQ) sleep latency, and PSQ total sleep were preselected as the major sleep variables. Between-groups comparisons indicated that, when compared with the placebo control, all drugs improved sleep, but differences were statistically significant only for the first 2 nights, i.e., the early interval. Midazolam was more effective than either dose level of flurazepam on treatment night 1. Within-group analyses indicated that all drug groups showed significantly improved sleep from baseline throughout drug administration, but the placebo group did not significantly improve from baseline by either objective or subjective measures at any of the three time intervals. The sleep of patients taking flurazepam 30 mg did not differ significantly from the sleep of those receiving the 15 mg dose for any of the five major sleep variables at any interval. Objective EEG and subjective PSQ sleep variables showed significant positive correlations.",

These data were used to compare the clinical safety and desirability of a benzodiazepine hypnotic with a very short half-life, midazolam 15 mg, with a hypnotic with a longer half-life, flurazepam 15 and 30 mg; both compounds were compared with a placebo control. There were 2 prestudy placebo nights followed by 14 consecutive nights of treatment. Of the 107 patients accepted, 99 completed the study. No marked adverse reactions were found in any area for any group. There was no increase in sleep apneas during the treatment period for any group. Results of this study provide additional evidence of the safety of benzodiazepine hypnotics.", 
    "7": "One hundred seven chronic insomniacs (41 men, 66 women; mean age, 37.9 years) with a history of use of benzodiazepines were recruited for a multicenter study testing the relative efficacy of flurazepam 15 mg or 30 mg, midazolam 15 mg, or placebo during a 14-day treatment period. Average duration of the complaint of insomnia was 13.5 years. Most (74%) of the patients met criteria for a diagnosis of persistent psychophysiological sleep disorder for both initiating and maintaining sleep.", 
    "8": "Thirty noninsomniac healthy adult men were enrolled in a multicenter pilot study to evaluate the sensitivity of psychomotor and cognitive tasks and subjective evaluation of performance and mood after treatment with flurazepam (Dalmane) 45 mg (larger than the recommended prescribing dose of 15-30 mg). This pilot study was also used to standardize testing procedures. The subjects were given either flurazepam or placebo at 72-hour intervals in a double-blind Latin square crossover design. Choice reaction time, but not simple reaction time, was drug sensitive. Divided attention and vigilance tasks were also sensitive to drug effects. Of the two cognitive tasks tested, addition was impaired by drug, but reading comprehension was not. Subjective evaluations of performance and mood states indicate that these are useful measures, but responses on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist were not influenced.", 
    "9": "Methods are described for a five-center study of flurazepam and midazolam, in which 107 patients with histories of benzodiazepine use for chronic insomnia were enrolled. Data were available for 99 of these patients. Staff and patient manuals and a behavior-based computer system were specially designed to measure and delineate clearly the study procedures and parameters. Patients were carefully followed and supported during a 20-day washout period and underwent extensive training on psychomotor performance tasks. They received placebo for 2 nights and were then randomly assigned to one of four study treatments--flurazepam 15 or 30 mg, midazolam 15 mg, or placebo--for 14 consecutive nights. All-night sleep electroencephalographic recordings were obtained on study nights--1 and 0 (placebo) and 1, 2, 7, 13, and 14 (treatment nights). Results of four computer-generated psychomotor performance tasks and three cognitive tasks, plus subjective evaluations of sleep, performance, and mood, were recorded in the morning after each night spent in the sleep laboratory. Blood and urine samples were analyzed for drug concentrations in plasma and for compliance with the protocol. A pilot study, using a high (nonclinical) dose of flurazepam (45 mg), preceded the multi-center study and was designed to evaluate tests in healthy volunteers and to familiarize staff with equipment and tests.", 
    "10": "Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine, a chemically novel nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent which acts at the benzodiazepine omega 1-receptor subtype in the brain. With a rapid onset of action and short elimination half-life, it reduces the latency to and prolongs the duration of sleep in patients with insomnia, yet has no major effects on sleep stages when given in dosages of 5 to 20 mg nightly. Rebound effects on withdrawal of the drug have not been observed. Unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem has no myorelaxant or anticonvulsant effects and its effects on anxiety appear to be minor. While zolpidem aids sedation, and may reduce memory or psychomotor function within the first 2 hours after administration of single oral doses, its use as a surgical premedicant remains to be established. Adverse effects are predominantly CNS and gastrointestinal in nature. Altered pharmacokinetics may lead to an increase in dose-proportionate adverse effects in the elderly and in patients with renal dysfunction. Limited evidence to date suggests that the dependence liability of zolpidem is minimal. Thus, zolpidem is an interesting alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of insomnia, with properties that potentially offer worthwhile advantages in this therapeutic area if they are confirmed with wider clinical experience.", 
    "11": "A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 23 chronic benzodiazepine users showed that overall, buspirone did not appear to be helpful in alleviating benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Buspirone (5 mg t.d.s.) or placebo was administered for four weeks before, during and after diazepam withdrawal. Patients taking buspirone had a markedly higher dropout rate (seven out of 11) than those taking placebo (one out of 12). Mean daily diazepam dosage at entry was significantly higher in the buspirone group, but overall initial diazepam dosage was not related to outcome. Higher subjectively rated anxiety at the start of withdrawal was significantly related to higher dropout rate, irrespective of treatment, and was greater (although not significantly so) in the buspirone group.", 
    "12": "We have studied the effect of i.v. flumazenil 0.01 mg kg-1 on the amnesia and sedation caused by midazolam 2 mg and 5 mg i.v. in volunteers in order to determine the relationship between the actions of the antagonist on these two effects. Midazolam caused dose-dependent central neural depression as assessed by critical flicker fusion frequency, and dose-dependent amnesia for word cards. In subjects given flumazenil 5 min after administration of midazolam, fusion frequency readings and memory were restored to levels comparable to those before midazolam administration. These two effects of flumazenil were similar in time course and extent, suggesting that they share the same mechanism of action. Flumazenil given alone had no effect on memory. The study has demonstrated anterograde amnesia following benzodiazepine administration and antagonism by flumazenil. There was neither retrograde amnesia nor retrograde antagonism of amnesia.", 
    "13": "We determined in 51 healthy patients undergoing body surface surgery the dose requirements for propofol, as part of a total i.v. anaesthesia technique with an alfentanil infusion. After premedication with temazepam, patients received alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 followed by an infusion of 50 micrograms kg-1 h-1. Patients were anaesthetized with a loading dose of propofol followed by a three-stage infusion designed to reach one of five preselected blood concentrations of propofol. The motor response to the initial surgical incision was noted and probit analysis was used to derive the ED50 (2.94 mg kg-1 h-1; 95% confidence limits: 2.35-3.37 mg kg-1 h-1) and ED95 (4.98 mg kg-1 h-1; 95% limits: 4.13-8.8 mg kg-1 h-1) for the final propotol infusion rate under these conditions. Whole blood concentration!of propofol at the time of the incision was related linearly to the inf!sion rate and the EC50 and EC95 (probit analysis) were derived as !.44 (95% confidence limits 0.62-1.87) and 4.05 (95% confidence lim!ts 2.78-30.5) micrograms ml-1, respectively. Post-operative recovery was!rapid, uncomplicated and uneventful. In a subgroup of eight patients,!the addition of clonidine 0.6 mg to the premedication significantly decreased the requirement for propofol (P less than 0.05) during surgery, but resulted in prolonged recovery times.", 
    "14": "Propofol provides smooth and rapid induction of anesthesia in adults and guarantees rapid recovery. The use of propofol in adults is frequently associated with pain on injection, but this can be reduced by: (1) injection into the relatively large veins in the forearm or the antecubital fossa: (2) addition of lignocaine to the propofol; or (3) injection of an opioid (alfentanil) before propofol. Compared with experience in adults, there is very little experience with propofol in pediatric anesthesia. The aim of this random prospective study was to compare the induction characteristics of propofol and thiopentone in pediatric anesthesia. Vigilance and behavior in the postoperative period were also compared. METHOD. A total of 75 healthy children aged 3-12 years who were undergoing elective operations were studied. All the children received premedication with 0.5 mg/kg midazolam with 0.02 mg/kg atropine by the rectal route. The children were divided randomly into 3 groups and received: group A, thiopentone 3-6 mg/kg; group B, propofol 1-3 mg/kg mixed with lignocaine (10/200 mg); group C, propofol 1-3 mg/kg, followed 1 min later by alfentanil 0.01 mg/kg. The induction agent was injected over 30 s, if possible into the vein in the forearm or the antecubital fossa. The immediate reaction on vein puncture and any discomfort during the injection were noted. After intubation the anesthesia was maintained with 1 vol% halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen (2:1). Arterial pressure was measured on arrival in the induction room, immediately after the induction of anesthesia, immediately after intubation and thereafter at 5-min intervals throughout the anesthesia. Heart rate (ECG) and arterial oxygen saturation (saO2) were measured continuously. The existence of any anterograde amnesia was tested (age over 4 years) by means of one of 6 pictures shown to each before operation. The ability to recall the picture shown was recorded 2-5 h postoperatively. The completeness of recovery was assessed at 10-min intervals up to 1 h, and thereafter at 1-h intervals. In the postoperative period a recovery test (postbox test) was performed. The incidence of side effects during the induction of anesthesia and also during recovery and the postoperative period (for 5 h) was recorded. RESULTS. There was no significant difference between the children in the 3 different groups with regard to age, body weight, type of operation, or duration of anesthesia. Among the total of 75 children, 66.7% accepted the vein puncture very well, and 24% well. In some children in each group we observed obstruction of the respiratory tract (group A, 36%; group B, 48%; group C, 64%). Apnea for 20 s was observed only in groups B and C (2 and 3 children respectively). During spontaneous respiration with room air there was a significant decrease of the arterial oxygen saturation about 1 min after induction in all groups. In children ventilated with oxygen by mask, the SaO2 remained nearly constant...", 
    "15": "Different concepts for analgosedation of neurosurgical patients are recommended during postoperative ventilation. In 30 neurosurgical patients (2 groups of 15 patients), we studied a continuous i.v. application of alfentanil (Rapifen) and midazolam (Dormicum) compared to an application of continuously given alfentanil with discontinuously given midazolam. A good analgosedation (i.e. sufficient sedation with good neurological judgement) was more frequently achieved (8/15 patients) by continuous application of both substances (alfentanil 0.023 mg/kg b.w./h, midazolam 0.10 mg/kg b.w./h), compared to discontinuous application of midazolam (4.5/15 patients; alfentanil 0.028 mg/kg b.w./h, midazolam 0.13 mg/kg b.w./h). No differences in extubation times were observed. We conclude from our results that a continuous application of both substances is superior to a discontinuous application of midazolam with continuously given alfentanil. A lower dosage of each substance is necessary to maintain a better state of analgosedation.", 
    "16": "In an open prospective study we investigated the efficacy of the supplementation of analgosedation by clonidine. 40 patients with oesophagus malignancy and definite alcohol abuse were on respiration therapy postoperatively after having been treated with oesophago-gastro anastomoses. With regard to manifestation intensity and development of withdrawal symptoms we found that during basic medication with piritramid-diazepam continuously i.v. administered clonidine can eliminate haemodynamic and psychovegetative symptoms related to alcohol withdrawal. The clonidine group required less analgosedation. The measurement of the urinary catecholamine output showed a normalised endogenous output. As a finding of importance the gastrovolume was reduced, and the haemodynamically firm, stable and less sedated patients of the clonidine group required fewer days of respiration therapy. Hence, the hazard of aspiration pneumonia and insufficienty anastomosis was lower. Risk of bradycardia of high potential danger did not occur with a median daily dosage of 1.09 mg/d clonidine. We consider clonidine to be a potent supplement to analgosedation for the surgical patient who is at high risk of alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "17": "To assess its construct validity and application, Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was administered to 267 inpatient substance abusers. One hundred seventy-two of the patients were alcoholic, 47 abused stimulants, and 48 abused other drugs, primarily benzodiazepines, marijuana, or were polysubstance abusers. Of the sample 33.8% were female. Analyses were conducted to (1) determine whether TPQ scores could be used to classify alcoholics as either Cloninger Type I or Type II; (2) examine the intercorrelations of TPQ scales and identify differences in these patterns due to drug of choice; (3) replicate previously obtained gender differences on the TPQ. The results indicate that (1) TPQ scores did not classify the alcoholics into the expected frequencies for Type I and Type II; (2) the scales were not independent and did not give rise to any differences among drug user groups, but (3) did confirm previously reported gender differences. These results indicate that Cloninger's model and the TPQ must be subjected to careful empirical study prior to their widespread acceptance.", 
    "18": "In adult male Sprague-Dawley rats kept at an ambient temperature of 23-25 degrees C, ethanol was injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 4.0 g/kg to produce a clear-cut impairment of autonomic and motorial functions. Following the injection of ethanol, motor coordination, measured on a rotorod, behavioral sleep, righting reflex and colonic temperature were monitored at predetermined intervals for 5.0-7.0 hr. In the first experiment, either 1.0 mg/kg RO 15-1788 (flumazenil), a benzodiazepine (BZ), receptor antagonist, or 1.0-5.0 mg/kg diazepam, a classical benzodiazepine receptor agonist, were injected intraperitoneally either alone or concurrently with ethanol's administration. In the second study, either RO 15-1788 (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg) or diazepam (1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) was injected at the nadir of the fall of body temperature induced by ethanol. Although RO 15-1788 alone failed to affect the rats' temperature, it did not prevent the characteristic ethanol-induced hypothermia but rather potentiated it in a dose-dependent manner. Further, this BZ receptor antagonist exacerbated motor incoordination and other behavioral effects when given either simultaneously with ethanol or at the nadir in the animals' core temperature. Although diazepam evoked a dose-dependent hypothermia, it did not enhance ethanol-induced hypothermia when both drugs were administered simultaneously. However, diazepam augmented motor incoordination and other effects and served to delay their recovery. When given to the rats at the nadir of ethanol hypothermia, diazepam did not potentiate ethanol's thermolysis but retarded the recovery from hypothermia; it caused also a dose-dependent delay in the recovery of motor coordination and other responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The behavioral consequences of exposure to stressors such as inescapable shock are usually quite transitory if testing is conducted in an environment different from that in which the stressor was administered. Daily running activity is an exception in that it remains depressed for several weeks following experience with inescapable shock. In the present experiments we found the administration of the triazolbenzodiazepine adinazolam able to both reduce this long-term activity reduction produced by inescapable shock when acutely administered before the inescapable shock, and to reverse the effect when chronically administered after the inescapable shock. Classic 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam have been able to prevent such effects when acutely administered before inescapable shock, but cannot reverse these effects when provided after the inescapable shock. Conversely, classic antidepressants such as desipramine have been unable to prevent these behavioral effects when given before inescapable shock in acute form, but can reverse the effects with chronic administration following the inescapable shock. Our observations that adinazolam can both prevent and reverse the effects of inescapable shock are consistent with reports that this agent has both anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in clinical use.", 
    "20": "The mechanism of action of aminophylline in prolonging seizures was tested in amygdala-kindled rats. Aminophylline prolonged the afterdischarge duration of kindled seizures. This seizure-prolonging action of aminophylline was strongly antagonized by the adenosine A1 agonist cyclohexyladenosine and partially antagonized by the benzodiazepine partial agonist RO 15-1788. However, the specific benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 8216 did not affect the seizure-prolonging action of aminophylline. Also, the potent anticonvulsant effect of diazepam on kindled seizures, which was completely antagonized by CGS 8216, was unaffected by aminophylline. Furthermore, a range of benzodiazepine inverse agonists, GABA antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and xanthines did not prolong afterdischarge durations. These results demonstrate that the seizure-prolonging action of aminophylline is due to block of A1 adenosine receptors since it is prevented by adenosine A1 agonists.", 
    "21": "The effect of diazepam, haloperidol, MK-801, and propranolol in antagonizing behavioral symptoms induced by lethal doses of cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine were studied in a rat model. Animals were first pretreated IP with potential antagonists, diazepam (2, 5, and 10 mg/kg), haloperidol (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), propranolol (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), MK-801 (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/kg), and then were challenged IP with cocaine (70 mg/kg) (LD85), d-amphetamine (75 mg/kg) (LD100), and methamphetamine (100 mg/kg) (LD90). Diazepam, at all doses, provided significant protection against cocaine- (p less than or equal to 0.01) and methamphetamine- (p less than or equal to 0.05) induced seizures and produced a dose-dependent effect against amphetamine-induced seizures. MK-801, at all doses, reduced seizures in all groups (p less than or equal to 0.01). Propranolol altered the incidence of methamphetamine-induced seizures. Significant protection against cocaine-induced death was afforded by diazepam (p less than or equal to 0.01) and propranolol (p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant protection against amphetamine-induced death was provided by haloperidol (all doses, p less than or equal to 0.1), MK-801 (all doses, p less than or equal to 0.1), and propranolol (10 and 20 mg/kg, p less than or equal to 0.1). No agent reduced the incidence of methamphetamine- (50 or 100 mg/kg) induced death. The failure of d-amphetamine antagonists to protect against methamphetamine-induced toxicity and death suggest that different mechanisms of toxicity may exist between these drugs.", 
    "22": "[3H]Flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding to cortical neurons from fetal rat brain was investigated in vitro. The use of a synthetic medium specific for neurons made it possible to plot a developmental curve of 3H-FNZ binding in an almost pure neuronal culture. Detectable specific binding was present in vitro at time 0 (that is, the 16th gestational day). A progressive increase of binding, due to an increment in the number of recognition sites, was observed on the subsequent days. The affinity of the specific binding sites to 3H-FNZ was enhanced by the addition of exogenous GABA, whereas the density was not affected.", 
    "23": "Status epilepticus implies a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures with persistent decreased consciousness, lasting at least 30 minutes. Both convulsive and nonconvulsive forms exist, either of which may lead to death or additional neurologic deficit. Therapy involves careful supportive care plus some combination of benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. The outcome depends first on the etiology and second on the rapidity with which seizures are controlled.", 
    "24": "We report the results of a double-blind cross-over study comparing clobazam and placebo in the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy. Fifty-two percent of patients had greater than 50% reduction in their seizure frequency when taking the clobazam. During the placebo phase no patient recorded a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Sex, age, seizure type, intellect did not appear to differentiate clobazam responsive from nonresponsive patients. Only 2/21 patients had behavioral changes on the drug sufficiently severe to require the patient to drop out of the study prematurely. Drug interactions between clobazam and the other anticonvulsant medicines did not occur.", 
    "25": "Clobazam, a novel benzodiazepine, was used as an add-on agent in 47 adult patients with intractable epilepsy and a variety of seizure types. A greater than 75% reduction in seizure frequency was observed in 42% (18) of the patients and a greater than 50% reduction in 65% (29) of the patients which was sustained over a mean follow-up period of 13.3 (+/- 5.6) months. Nine patients had to discontinue the drug due to minor adverse effects or increased seizures. Possible tolerance developed in 6 patients. Plasma levels of the active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam were linearly related to dosage and appeared to correlate with both therapeutic and toxic responses. Clobazam appears to be a safe and effective add-on antiepileptic for a wide variety of seizure types in intractable epilepsy.", 
    "26": "Twenty-four healthy volunteers, aged 21-59 years, received single 30 mg oral doses of the benzodiazepine hypnotic temazepam. Levels of intact temazepam were determined in multiple plasma samples drawn during 48 h after dosage. Intact temazepam, its direct glucuronide conjugate, and the conjugate of its demethylated (oxidized) metabolite oxazepam were measured in two consecutive 24-h urine collections. Mean kinetic variables for temazepam in plasma were: peak plasma level (Cmax), 873 ng ml-1; time of peak, 1.36 h after dosage; volume of distribution, 0.961 kg-1; elimination half-life 9.9 h; clearance, 1.16 ml min-1 kg-1. Volume of distribution increased significantly with body weight (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001), and Cmax decreased with weight (r = -0.58, p less than 0.01). Only 0.2 per cent of the dose was excreted as intact temazepam, and negligible amounts as intact oxazepam. However, 39 per cent of the dose was recovered as temazepam glucuronide, and oxazepam glucuronide accounted for another 4.7 per cent of the dose. The remainder was not accounted for. Thus, a significant fraction of temazepam clearance occurs by direct glucuronide conjugation, with the conjugate temazepam glucuronide excreted in urine. A much smaller fraction undergoes parallel oxidation to form oxazepam, which is subsequently conjugated to oxazepam glucuronide and excreted in urine.", 
    "27": "Three different dosages (0.25, 0.35, and 0.45 mg/kg) of rectally administered midazolam were compared with each other and with placebo for preanesthetic medication in children undergoing dental extractions. Eighty patients between the ages of 2 and 10 years were randomly allocated into four groups in this double-blind study. The results from this trial show that 30 minutes after rectal administration of all doses of midazolam, good anxiolysis, sedation, and cooperation were obtained in most patients. A high prevalence (23%) of disinhibition reactions was observed, particularly in the 0.45 mg/kg group. For this reason, 0.25 or 0.35 mg/kg appears to be the dose of choice when rectal midazolam is used for premedication in children.", 
    "28": "Thirty-seven patients with advanced incurable malignancies who were receiving their first course of cisplatin (greater than or equal to 90 mg/m2 bolus), alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents, were entered in this randomized, double-blind study to determine the antiemetic efficacy of the addition of high-dose dexamethasone to lorazepam plus metoclopramide. All patients received lorazepam (1.5 mg/m2) and metoclopramide (2.0 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) 30 minutes before cisplatin, with the same dose of metoclopramide repeated 1.5, 3.5, 6.5, and 9.5 hours after the 30-minute cisplatin infusion. Patients were randomized to receive dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo by slow bolus injection 30 minutes before cisplatin. All patients were hospitalized for 24 hours and evaluated by observation after cisplatin and a patient questionnaire before discharge. Eighteen patients received metoclopramide and lorazepam without dexamethasone: six (33%) reported no vomiting and four (22%) reported no nausea or vomiting. Nineteen patients also received dexamethasone: 14 (74%) had no vomiting and 13 (68%) reported no nausea or vomiting. These differences were statistically significantly different (P = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively). The side effects attributable to the antiemetic regimen were somnolence (100%), confusion (8%), and diarrhea (46%), and were the same in both arms. Dexamethasone significantly improved the antiemetic efficacy of metoclopramide plus lorazepam without adding toxicity. This three-drug combination gave a high rate of control of acute emesis induced by high-dose cisplatin.",

Eleven patients who required surgical removal of two lower impacted molars (left and right) were studied. The results showed that plasma beta-endorphin, ACTH and cortisol levels were increased significantly during surgery and decreased to baseline levels 30 minutes after completion of the operation in nonsedated patients. When diazepam was premedicated intravenously, elevations of ACTH and cortisol were abolished. Plasma beta-endorphin was still increased but significantly blocked by diazepam pretreatment.", 
    "30": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors were measured in human circulating lymphocytes using 3H-PK 11195 as specific ligand. In a group of outpatients with anxiety disorders a significant decrease of receptor density (-37%) was found compared with age-matched controls. In these patients long-term diazepam treatment restored binding density to normal levels: the effect persisted after drug withdrawal. Acute i.v. diazepam administration did not change receptor density. The observed receptor changes could reflect a down-regulation phenomenon and indicate that lymphocyte function reflect central nervous events.", 
    "31": "GABA is present in the pineal gland of several mammals, where it is synthesized in situ as well as taken up from the circulation. This article reviews available information suggesting a local, physiological role of pineal GABA. Both the pinealocytes and the glial pineal cells have the capacity to take up GABA from the extracellular space. The GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic decarboxylase (GAD) is detectable in the pineal gland; in the bovine pineal GAD exhibits \"neuronal-like\" properties. By employing a specific antibody against GABA, about 15% of pinealocytes gave a positive reaction in bovine pineal glands. After a depolarizing stimulus, GABA was released from bovine and rat pineal glands by both Ca2(+)-dependent and Ca2(+)-independent processes. By employing neuronal and glial GABA uptake inhibitors, most 3H-GABA release in bovine pineal gland could be attributed to a \"neuronal\" (presumably pinealocyte) compartment. Several components of the GABA type A receptor supramolecular complex (i.e., GABA binding sites, central-type benzodiazepine binding sites, Cl- ionophore), as well as a minor population of GABA type B receptor sites, were detected in bovine and human pineal glands. In the rat pineals, GABA is released by norepinephrine (NE) acting through alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Physiological concentrations of GABA, by its effect on type A receptor sites, impaired NE-induced melatonin release; by acting on GABA type B receptors, it decreased NE release. Another presumable presynaptic effect of GABA (i.e., to augment maximal velocity and to decrease affinity of NE uptake) was mediated by type A receptor sites. It is proposed that pre- and postsynaptic activity of GABA in the pineal does not differ from that found for GABA interneurons in local circuits of the brain.", 
    "32": "Ethanol is known to be anxiolytic and this effect may be mediated through GABA transmission acting on the GABAA-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore complex. Recent studies from our laboratory have suggested that GABA transmission and the GABAA-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore complex might be involved in the rewarding action of ethanol in alcohol-preferring rats. We report here immunocytochemical and morphometric studies analyzing the GABAergic terminal density in the nucleus accumbens (NA), corpus striatum, nucleus tractus solitarius, and lateral septum of the selectively bred P (alcohol-preferring) and the NP (alcohol-nonpreferring) lines of rats, as well as of the high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) lines of rats. The NA was included for analysis because this structure has been implicated as an important component of the brain reward system. An increase of GABAergic terminal density was found in the NA of the P rats, when compared with the NP rats. Similarly, there were more GABAergic terminals in the NA of HAD rats than of the LAD rats. No differences between the lines were seen in the other brain regions examined. The results suggest that alcohol preference in P and HAD rats may be related to increased GABA terminals and enhanced GABAergic inhibition within the NA.", 
    "33": "Rats were acutely (45 min) exposed to 100-dB white noise, and benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were studied immediately after exposure by the receptor-binding assay using 3H-flunitrazepam as the ligand. An increase in the concentration of receptors was observed in the cerebral cortex, whereas no significant change in receptor concentration was seen in the hippocampus and cerebellum. No significant effect of noise on receptor binding affinity was detected in the three brain regions studied. Experimental handling also did not significantly affect the benzodiazepine receptor properties. These data confirm previous reports that acute exposure to stressor can cause rapid changes in benzodiazepine receptors in the brain.", 
    "34": "In order to assess changes in enkephalin release and biosynthesis, the levels of the tripeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly (YGG), a characteristic extracellular metabolite of enkephalins, and of the proenkephalin mRNA in mouse striatum were evaluated after a single administration of GABAergic agents. Significant and long-lasting decreases in steady state YGG levels were elicited by muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor agonist, diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, or aminooxyacetic acid, a GABA-transaminase inhibitor. In addition, muscimol offset the elevation of striatal YGG elicited by bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, which entirely drives the released enkephalins into the metabolic pathway operated by enkephalinase (EC 3.4.24.11). Diazepam potentiated the effect of muscimol so that the YGG decrease induced by the combination of these two drugs was maximal after 30 min (-60%) and still significant (-40%) after 6 h, this potentiation being antagonized by pre-treatment with Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. By contrast [Met5]enkephalin steady-state levels were marginally affected by GABAergic agents, being only slightly reduced 6 h after the combination of muscimol and diazepam. After 3 h the same treatment also reduced by about 30% the level of proenkephalin mRNA, this change being maximal after 6 h (-45%) and still present after 24 h. These compared changes in various indexes of enkephalin neuron activity suggest that stimulation of GABAA receptors depresses enkephalin release immediately and for several hours, whereas preproenkephalin gene expression is decreased in a somewhat delayed and longer lasting manner. These patterns of temporal changes in biosynthesis and release of the neuropeptide presumably account for the limited changes in its steady state levels.", 
    "35": "The temporal relationship between the expression of a transmitter and its corresponding receptor may provide important insights into the development of synaptic circuits in the central nervous system. Here we examined the emergence of the inhibitory transmitter GABA, and subunits of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in a well-characterized cerebellar circuit formed by granule cells and the synapses they make with Golgi II neurons in the cerebella of rats ranging in age from birth to 21 days. The presence of GABA was determined immunocytochemically. The presence of the GABAA receptor was demonstrated by localizing the alpha 1 subunit of the receptor using in situ hybridization and immunochemical localization of a 50 kDa benzodiazepine-binding subunit using monoclonal antibodies. Germinal cells of the external granular layer which give rise to granule cells did not express the GABAA receptor at any age. Similarly, receptor labeling could not be detected in granule cells during their postmitotic migratory period. In the internal granular layer, immature postmigratory granule cells are unlabeled. The expression of GABAA receptor subunits was first observed on the fifth postnatal day (P5) and then only in the more mature granule cells which have well elaborated dendrites in contact with presynaptic elements. The number of labeled neurons increased over the subsequent ages examined. Presynaptic elements in association with the dendrites of labeled granule cells had ultrastructural features characteristic of Golgi II cell axon terminals. These elements demonstrate GABA transmitter as early as P3, preceded by 2-3 days receptor labeling in the granular layer. Therefore, granule cells express GABAA receptor subunits only after they have completed migration and their dendrites have become involved in specific synaptic circuits, including innervation by GABAergic afferents.", 
    "36": "Results from [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-dependent 36Cl- uptake indicated that the pyrolysis product of liquid trimethylol propane (TMP) containing organic phosphates interacts with the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complex (GBRC) producing a receptor-mediated reduction in 36Cl- flux. The pyrolysate-ligand interaction was competitive and directly proportional to the trimethylol propane phosphate (TMPP) content of the combustion product. TBPS displacement demonstrated that TMPP had less affinity than did TBPS and picrotoxin, but greater affinity than GABA, racemic dimethylbutyl barbituric acid (DMBB), clonazepam, and phenobarbital for their respective recognition sites. Addition of exogenous GABA was a necessary condition for demonstrating clonazepam-induced ligand displacement, thus being indicative of an allosteric interaction. The same rank order held for altering GABA-dependent 36Cl- uptake with the caveat of inhibitors vs enhancers, and noting that pentobarbital was less potent than DMBB. Concentration-dependent ligand displacement by GBRC agonists and antagonists quantitatively correlated with alterations in GABA-dependent 36Cl- uptake. The median convulsant dose (CD50) of pyrolysate TMPP was higher than that of synthetic TMPP. The presence of combustion by-products altering the dispositional kinetics of the former is felt to be the reason for this difference. Under our experimental conditions, phenobarbital was the most effective antidote for pyrolysate (TMPP) toxicity. The inhalant convulsant, flurothyl, was found not to displace [35S]TBPS binding, not to affect GABA-dependent 36Cl- uptake, and not to respond to the anticonvulsants in a manner consistent with a strict GABAA receptor phenomenon.", 
    "37": "Alkyl-substituted gamma-butyrolactones (GBLs) and gamma-thiobutyrolactones (TBLs) are neuroactive chemicals. beta-Substituted compounds are convulsant, whereas alpha-alkyl substituted GBLs and TBLs are anticonvulsant. The structural similarities between beta-alkyl GBLs and the convulsant picrotoxinin suggested that alkyl substituted GBLs and TBLs act at the picrotoxin receptor. To test this hypothesis we examined the interactions of convulsant and anticonvulsant GBLs and TBLs with the picrotoxin, benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding sites of the GABA receptor complex. All of these convulsants and anticonvulsants studied competitively displaced 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS), a ligand that binds to the picrotoxin receptor. This inhibition of 35S-TBPS binding was not blocked by the GABA antagonist bicuculline methobromide. The convulsant GBLs and TBLs also partially inhibited [3H]muscimol binding to the GABA site and [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site, but they did so at concentrations substantially greater than those that inhibited 35S-TBPS binding. The anticonvulsant GBLs and TBLs had no effect on either [3H]muscimol or [3H]flunitrazepam binding. In contrast to the GBLs and TBLs, pentobarbital inhibited TBPS binding in a manner that was blocked by bicuculline methobromide, and it enhanced both [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding. Both ethosuximide and tetramethylsuccinimide, neuroactive compounds structurally similar to GBLs, competitively displaced 35S-TBPS from the picrotoxin receptor and both compounds were weak inhibitors of [3H] muscimol binding. In addition, ethosuximide also partially diminished [3H]flunitrazepam binding. These data demonstrate that the site of action of alkyl-substituted GBLs and TBLs is different from that of GABA, barbiturates and benzodiazepines. We suggest that the GBLs and TBLs act at the picrotoxin receptor.", 
    "38": "Because of uncertainty concerning the interaction of ethanol with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated events, the present work was designed to investigate the effect of ethanol on GABA transmission in the rat septal area using behavioral and electrophysiological techniques. Microinjection of the GABAA agonist muscimol into the medial septal area (MSA) enhanced, and bicuculline administration antagonized, ethanol-induced impairment of the aerial righting reflex. Microinjection of these drugs into the lateral septum (LSi) did not influence this measure of ethanol-induced sedation. Furthermore, intraseptal injections of muscimol or bicuculline in saline-treated rats had no effect on the aerial righting reflex. These data suggest that the MSA plays a critical modulatory role in the sedative actions of ethanol. To assess the effect of ethanol on muscimol responses in the MSA and LSi at the cellular level, GABA was applied by iontophoresis to rhythmically bursting neurons of the MSA and to cells in the LSi. The magnitude of the resultant inhibition by GABA on these cells was assessed before and after systemic administration of ethanol. Ethanol enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition of MSA neural activity, but did not alter GABA-mediated inhibition of cellular activity in the LSi. In contrast, the inhibition of cellular activity in the MSA, caused by a maximally effective concentration of the benzodiazepine flurazepam, was not altered by ethanol. Other work in the MSA demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the fimbria caused an inhibition of ongoing single unit activity that was reduced by concurrent application of bicuculline. The duration of this electrically elicited inhibition in the MSA was enhanced after ethanol injection and then recovered to base-line levels. In addition, ethanol (1.5 mg/kg) caused an enhancement of the inhibition induced by nipecotic acid, a GABA uptake inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that GABA-mediated neural inhibition is enhanced by ethanol in the MSA but not the LSi, indicating that the actions of ethanol on GABA-induced inhibition can be site specific. It is proposed that the cellular action of ethanol may depend upon a specific molecular composition of the GABA receptor complex which may vary at selected sites in the brain.", 
    "39": "The electrical current thresholds for pain (ECTP) in the skin of the neck and tail were measured in rats with chronically implanted lumbar subarachnoid catheters. The effects of a benzodiazepine antagonist and a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist on the analgesic effects of equivalent doses of midazolam, fentanyl, and ketocyclazocine were studied. These were the minimum doses producing maximal segmental analgesia when given intrathecally (i.e., they all caused a significant and maximum increase in ECTP in the tail, which was similar for all three drugs, but no significant change in the ECTP in the neck). Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) administration caused a parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curve for midazolam spinal analgesia. Segmental analgesia following midazolam was also significantly attenuated (P less than 0.05) when the selective GABA antagonist bicuculline was given intrathecally at the same time as midazolam. The highest dose of bicuculline used (50 pmol) caused no significant attenuation of the segmental analgesic effects of either ketocyclazocine or fentanyl. The authors concluded that the segmental analgesia produced by intrathecal midazolam is mediated by the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex that is involved in other benzodiazepine actions.", 
    "40": "Fluorescein conjugates of the high-affinity benzodiazepine receptor ligands Ro 15-1788 and Ro 7-1986 were synthesized. The binding of these fluorescent ligands (BD 621 and BD 607) to benzodiazepine receptors was characterized by direct fluorescence measurement. Both the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of BD 621 and BD 607 and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) estimated by fluorescence monitoring were consistent with values obtained by using radioligand binding techniques. The binding of BD 621 and BD 607 assessed by fluorescence measurement was reversible, abolished by photoaffinity labeling with Ro 15-4513, and unaffected by a variety of substances that do not bind to benzodiazepine receptors. The potencies of chemically diverse benzodiazepine receptor compounds to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding were highly correlated (r = 0.94, P less than 0.001), with potencies obtained from radioligand binding techniques. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using direct fluorescence measurement techniques to quantitate ligand-receptor interactions.", 
    "41": "The authors found significantly fewer total platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding sites in 13 nonmedicated patients with borderline personality disorder than in 11 patients with borderline personality disorder who were receiving low doses of benzodiazepines and 18 nonpsychiatric control subjects. The two patient groups showed comparable degrees of depression as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. However, nonmedicated borderline patients were considerably more anxious than medicated patients, raising the possibility that lower alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding in borderline personality disorder is related to anxiety.", 
    "42": "Inherited congenital myoclonus (ICM) of Poll Hereford cattle is a neurological disease in which there are severe alterations in spinal cord glycine-mediated neurotransmission. There is a specific and marked decrease, or defect, in glycine receptors and a significant increase in neuronal (synaptosomal) glycine uptake. Here we have examined the characteristics of the cerebral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex, and demonstrate that the malfunction of the spinal cord inhibitory system is accompanied by a change in the major inhibitory system in the cerebral cortex. In synaptic membrane preparations from ICM calves, both high-and low-affinity binding sites for the GABA agonist [3H]muscimol were found (KD = 9.3 +/- 1.5 and 227 +/- 41 nM, respectively), whereas only the high-affinity site was detectable in controls (KD = 14.0 +/- 3.1 nM). The density and affinity of benzodiazepine agonist binding sites labelled by [3H]diazepam were unchanged, but there was an increase in GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding. The affinity for t-[3H]butylbicyclo-o-benzoate, a ligand that binds to the GABA-activated chloride channel, was significantly increased in ICM brain membranes (KD = 148 +/- 14 nM) compared with controls (KD = 245 +/- 33 nM). Muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake was 12% greater in microsacs prepared from ICM calf cerebral cortex, and the uptake was more sensitive to block by the GABA antagonist picrotoxin. The results show that the characteristics of the GABA receptor complex in ICM calf cortex differ from those in cortex from unaffected calves, a difference that is particularly apparent for the low-affinity, physiologically relevant GABA receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The effect of acute and chronic administration of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone on successive negative contrast was investigated in Experiments 1-6. Contrast in consummatory behavior was induced by shifting rats from a 32% to a 4% sucrose solution. Experiments 1-5 showed that buspirone (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 15.0 mg/kg) was ineffective in alleviating contrast or in facilitating recovery from contrast. The 15 mg/kg dose substantially decreased consummatory responding. Experiment 6 showed that the chronic (24 days) administration of buspirone (0.5, 2.0 mg/kg) also did not alleviate contrast. The chronic, but not the acute administration of the 2.0 mg/kg dose decreased consummatory behavior. In Experiment 7 the 5-HT1A agonist gepirone (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) was also found to be ineffective in reducing contrast but, at the higher doses, decreased overall sucrose intake. Experiments 8 and 9 found that the 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin (2.0 and 8.0 mg/kg) and ritanserin (0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg) also did not alleviate contrast. Midazolam (1.0 mg/kg), included as a positive control, eliminated contrast. These data suggest that serotonergic mechanisms are not involved in negative contrast.", 
    "44": "Rat pups exhibit transient \"developmental dyskinesias,\" such as tremor and myoclonus, that are analogous to motor immaturities of the human neonate. Myoclonic jerks in the neonatal rat may reflect a developmental imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, spontaneous myoclonic jerks of naive rat pups (n = 200) were characterized behaviorally and pharmacologically. The frequency of myoclonus was high (154 +/- 14 jerks/30 min) in the first week. The distribution of jerks included limbs (47%) (27% in forelimbs and 20% in hindlimbs), tail (30%), trunk (12%), and head (11%). Myoclonus constituted the predominant neonatal adventitious movement (81%). Myoclonic jerks were variable in intensity, focal and multi-focal more often than generalized, and occurred when nonrespiratory movements were infrequent or absent, suggesting sleep. Myoclonic frequency significantly diminished after the second week; therefore, drug effects were studied in the first 7 days. Systemic injection of the novel noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 blocked neonatal myoclonus in a dose-dependent manner (ID50 = 0.67 mg/kg; r = 0.93). The nonselective excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptor antagonist kynurenic acid was ineffective. The EAA antagonist AP4 (1 and 10 mg/kg) also reduced myoclonic jerks, but other drugs, such as the selective glycine antagonist Iso-THAO (1 and 10 mg/kg), strychnine (0.5 mg/kg), clonazepam, and diazepam (1 mg/kg), were ineffective blockers. The putative agonists quisqualic acid (1-50 mg/kg) and NMDA (1-10 mg/kg) altered myoclonus only at behaviorally toxic doses. These data suggest that EAA receptors participate in developmental myoclonus of the neonatal rat and that development myoclonus may be a useful quantitative model of functional maturity of excitatory/inhibitory synapses. The efficacy of MK-801 also should be evaluated in drug- and lesion-induced myoclonus. Recognition of the high frequency and state dependence of spontaneous myoclonic jerks in neonatal rats may be important to neonatal antiepileptic drug studies.", 
    "45": "A review of the published literature reveals many unanswered questions regarding the effects of sedative-hypnotics on sleep, performance, and mood. The relationship between plasma half-life and hypnotic efficacy is also not clear. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-groups, multicenter study was designed to examine sleep, performance, and mood in patients with insomnia. A large, heterogeneous sample of patients with a history of benzodiazepine use for chronic insomnia was chosen to reflect the adult population for which sedative-hypnotics are often prescribed and to ensure statistical reliability. Although the major focus of the current study was on the effects of two benzodiazepine hypnotics on performance, this study also provided information on the following important issues: (1) effect of dose level; (2) short-versus long-term administration; and (3) significance of plasma half-life as it relates to hypnotic efficacy.", 
    "46": "The substitution of either bromazepam, diazepam, methaqualone, mazindol, nortriptyline or bupropion for pentobarbital, in dependent rats, was assessed using a continuous drug infusion method. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were made dependent on pentobarbital during 12 days of continuous, intraperitoneal, pentobarbital infusion. On Day 13, pentobarbital was replaced with either saline, vehicle, or one of the drugs of interest and rats were infused for 24 h. On Day 14, all rats were infused, for 24 h, with saline. Changes in both body weight and behavioral indices of withdrawal were assessed during Day 13 and 14. It was observed that bromazepam and methaqualone substituted for pentobarbital in a dose-dependent fashion. Diazepam also substituted in pentobarbital dependent rats but, inexplicably, the low dose of diazepam provided better substitution than did the higher dose. On the other hand, neither mazindol or nortriptyline substituted for pentobarbital and there was a tendency for exacerbation of the withdrawal signs. Finally, it was noted that the low dose of bupropion appeared to decrease the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. The data supports the view that the substitution of compounds for pentobarbital, in dependent rats, is limited to those compounds which, presumably, possess similar mechanisms of action in the CNS.", 
    "47": "Lithium carbonate is the drug of choice for the management of bipolar disorder, but 20% to 40% of patients do not exhibit adequate response to this agent. Moreover, adjunctive therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (for depression) and neuroleptics (for mania) is widely prescribed in most lithium clinics. These agents, however, may precipitate or exacerbate the subsequent phase of the illness. More recently, carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug, has shown promise in the management of bipolar illness. Used either alone or in combination with lithium, carbamazepine has been associated with a response rate of approximately 65% in more than 500 patients enrolled in controlled and uncontrolled studies. The drug's antimanic effects have been clearly demonstrated, but its antidepressant effects must undergo further examination. Other anticonvulsants (such as valproate) appear highly effective. The high-potency benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam) and calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil) are also being evaluated in this patient population.", 
    "48": "Intravenously injected midazolam was associated with a greater degree of sedation, as assessed by 24-h retrograde amnesia, than the longer acting benzodiazepine, diazepam. No differences in the frequency of pain on injection or the occurrence of venous sequelae were noted between the two preparations.", 
    "49": "A total of 131 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were sedated with midazolam given as a bolus injection over 5 seconds. The oxygen saturation was continuously measured using a pulse oximeter. Supplemental oxygen was given via nasal cannulae at a rate of 3 litres per minute to 54 patients, while the remaining 77 patients only received oxygen if their oxygen saturation dropped below 85%. Both groups in the present series were compared with 3 previously published series of patients, in whom we had used intravenous midazolam as a slow titrated injection. Despite using on average only two-thirds of the dose of midazolam, following bolus injection the degree of oxygen desaturation during the endoscopic procedure was greater, and the ability of supplemental oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae to prevent hypoxia was less (P less than 0.01), than with a slow titrated injection.", 
    "50": "This study has compared the effects of a cyclopyrrolone, zopiclone, a benzodiazepine, diazepam, and an imidazopyridine, zolpidem, on dopamine (DA) and DOPAC levels, and DA utilization (DOPAC/DA ratio) in rat striatum and prefrontal cortex. The endogenous levels of DA were significantly increased by both zopiclone (2.5, 10 and 40 mg kg-1 p.o.) and diazepam (10 and 40 mg kg-1 p.o.) in the prefrontal cortex, whereas striatal DA content was significantly increased only with the highest dose of diazepam (40 mg kg-1 p.o.). Diazepam (10 and 40 mg kg-1 p.o.) decreased cortical level of DOPAC more markedly than striatal levels, whereas zopiclone (40 mg kg-1 p.o.) only slightly decreased striatal DOPAC levels. Zopiclone and diazepam dose-dependently decreased DA utilization, an effect which was more marked in prefrontal cortex than in striatum. This result was confirmed with zolpidem, another benzodiazepine ligand. Zopiclone was most potent at decreasing DA utilization at the cortical level. The diazepam-induced decreases in DA metabolism and utilization were antagonized by Ro 15-1788, suggesting that the effects seen were mediated by specific benzodiazepine receptors. Thus, our results clearly show that ligands acting on the benzodiazepine receptor GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex can decrease the utilization of dopamine in unstressed rats. The preferential decrease in cortical DA utilization induced by benzodiazepine ligands may be compared to the well-known activation by stress of the mesocortical DAergic system.", 
    "51": "There is a convergence of data from various sources suggesting that there are meaningful differences among the benzodiazepines with respect to their attractiveness as drugs of abuse for drug abusers. Laboratory studies of subjective and reinforcing effects in drug abusers, interviews with drug abusers, clinical judgment of medical professionals, and epidemiological studies all indicate that diazepam, in particular, has a greater abuse liability than many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggest that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. These differences in abuse liability among benzodiazepines are analogous to the widely recognized differences in abuse liability within the barbiturate class that have proved to be important in helping guide clinicians' drug prescribing practices.", 
    "52": "A series of 2-substituted-4,4a,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[h]cinnolin-3(2H)-ones and related compounds were synthesized and tested for their ability to displace [3H]diazepam from rat brain membranes. Among them, compounds bearing 4-methoxyphenyl, 4-chlorophenyl, or 4-methylphenyl group at the position-2 were found to have high affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor. 2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-9-methyl- and 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9-methoxy-4,4a,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[h]cinnolin- 3(2H)-ones (8b-14 and 8b-15, respectively) showed a potent affinity comparable to that of diazepam. These results suggest that a topographical planarity or pseudoplanarity of these molecules is essential for high affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor. The structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "53": "Flupirtine (D-9998, Katadolon, CAS 56995-20-1); CAS 56995-20-1), a novel non-opioid analgesic was investigated for possible benzodiazepine-like activities. In receptor binding studies flupirtine and its metabolite were found to reveal no affinity for specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding up to a concentration of 10 mumol/l. In drug discrimination studies, rats were trained to discriminate the novel analgesic flupirtine (10 mg/kg i.p.) from no drug (NaCl 0.9%) under a two-choice fixed-ratio 5 shock-termination schedule. Flupirtine yielded a dose-response curve with an ED50 of 3.9 mg/kg i.p. In generalization tests with a benzodiazepine-type compound lorazepam (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) did not generalize to the flupirtine training dose. In physical dependence studies using rats, during and after chronic oral administration of flupirtine (2 x 80 mg/kg p.o.) over 45 days no signs of benzodiazepine- and opiate-like physical dependence were observed in rats after withdrawal of the drug. In contrast diazepam (2 x 5 bzw. 2 x 10 mg/kg p.o.) induced typical symptoms of physical dependence. A significant weight loss of the codeine treated animals (2 x 60 mg/kg p.o.) and other typical side effects were also observed after withdrawal of codeine. These results clearly demonstrate that flupirtine has no affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and is free of benzodiazepine or opiate/opioid-like abuse potential.", 
    "54": "In an attempt to establish whether prolonged withdrawal symptoms after stopping intake of benzodiazepines is caused by return of anxiety, hysteria, abnormal illness behaviour or the dependence process itself producing perhaps a prolonged neurotransmitter imbalance, a group of such patients suffering prolonged withdrawal symptoms (PWS) was compared on a range of psychophysiological measures with matched groups of anxious and conversion hysteria patients and normal controls. It was found that the psychophysiological markers of anxiety were not marked in the PWS group; nor were the averaged evoked response abnormalities found to be associated with cases of hysterical conversion in evidence. The PWS group were hard to distinguish from normal controls on the basis of psychophysiological measures and thus it was felt to be unlikely to be an affective disturbance. It was concluded that PWS is likely to be a genuine iatrogenic condition, a complication of long-term benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "55": "In order to investigate whether early malnutrition causes lasting changes in the reactivity to anxiolytic drugs, rat dams during lactation (21 days) and pups after weaning until the 49th day of life were fed on 8% casein diet (M rats), while their well-nourished controls received 25% casein (W rats). From day 50 on all animals ate the same balanced diet. Experiments started on the 91st day. Rats deprived for 22 hours drank water containing either 1.8% or 2.7% sodium chloride for 30 min in a test chamber, total intake being measured. Dose-effect curves for diazepam (0.5-5.0 mg/kg, IP), as well as for the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics ipsapirone (0.5-5.0 mg/kg), ritanserin (0.05-1.0 mg/kg) and isamoltane (2.5-20.0 mg/kg) were determined in M as well as in W rats. Diazepam and ipsapirone dose-dependently released drinking suppressed by either salt concentration in W rats, but caused little or no effect in M rats. Ritanserin and isamoltane were ineffective in both groups. These and previously reported results show that early protein malnutrition markedly reduces anticonflict effects of anxiolytics, indicating long-lasting impairment of neuronal systems underlying emotional behavior.", 
    "56": "The effects of benzodiazepines on a visual pattern matching-to-sample (MTS) task were examined in nine healthy male volunteers. The MTS task employed randomly generated checkerboard-like stimuli presented on a video display. The sample and two comparison stimuli were simultaneously presented. Nonmatching comparison stimuli were randomly generated to be 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, or 50.0 percent different from the sample. Subjects responded on left or right button manipulanda to identify the matching comparison stimulus. The nonmatching stimulus condition was maintained constant for a 60-sec component and the percentage difference of the nonmatching stimuli was systematically varied across multiple components. The effects of triazolam (2.25-9.0 micrograms/kg) and lorazepam (7.5-45 micrograms/kg) were examined in a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Under placebo conditions, response rates and accuracy were a positive function of the nonmatching stimulus discriminability. Triazolam produced dose-related decreases in response rate at nonmatching stimulus conditions greater than or equal to 25%. Only the 9.0 micrograms/kg dose of triazolam decreased accuracy and this occurred across all nonmatching stimulus conditions. Lorazepam effects were qualitatively similar but less robust than those of triazolam.", 
    "57": "In mammalian brain, the activation of GABAA-receptors is associated with the opening of chloride channels, whose function can be allosterically modulated by drugs, in particular by ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor. Agonistic ligands potentiate while inverse agonists reduce the efficiency of GABA. We have cloned cDNAs encoding alpha 1- and beta 1-subunits of the GABAA-receptor from rat brain. When the corresponding RNAs were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. GABA-induced currents were recorded which were inhibited by bicuculline and potentiated by pentobarbital. GABA activated the channel in a weakly cooperative manner. Furthermore, the GABA-response was modulated by benzodiazepine receptor ligands. However, not only various agonists but also the antagonist flumazenil and the inverse agonist DMCM potentiated the GABA-response. Thus, alpha 1- and beta 1-subunits are sufficient to form GABAA-receptors which contain benzodiazepine binding sites, although in a functionally restricted form.", 
    "58": "We examined the ability of selective CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists to induce or modulate the locomotor stimulant effects of dopamine agonists in MPTP-treated squirrel monkeys. Administration of 1-100 micrograms/kg i.p. of either the selective CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (MK-329) or the CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260 alone failed to stimulate a locomotor response in parkinsonian monkeys. In contrast, treatment with L-365,260 caused a 50-60% potentiation of the locomotor stimulatory effects of L-DOPA or (+)-PHNO. No such modulatory effects were observed following pretreatment with devazepide. We suggest that CCK-B receptor antagonists may be useful adjuncts to existing dopamine replacement therapy for improved management of Parkinson's disease.", 
    "59": "In the primary somatosensory cortex of cats, the size of the receptive fields (RFs) of cutaneously responsive neurones is under the control of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated inhibition when the cells are situated in rapidly adapting (RA) background regions. Cells located in slowly adapting (SA) or low-velocity rapidly adapting (LVRA) background regions do not appear to be affected by GABA significantly in the spatial domain, although other response properties such as threshold and firing pattern are under the influence of bicuculline methiodide (BMI) sensitive processes. The GABA receptor is one component of the oligomeric complex that includes the benzodiazepine (Bzd) binding site, the barbiturate recognition site, and the Cl- ionophore. Owing to current debates about the possible existence of endogenous ligands of Bzd receptors, we have examined whether Bzd agonists, in addition to GABA and BMI, have RF-modulating actions on RA S1 neurones and have assessed the effectiveness of the Bzd antagonist, Ro 15-1788, in this experimental paradigm. Ro 15-1788 is an imidazobenzodiazepine that acts as a specific competitive antagonist of Bzds by exerting high-affinity interactions with that Bzd receptor through which anticonvulsant effects of flurazepam (flu) and diazepam are expressed. This has been shown previously in neurochemical, behavioral, neurological, and pharmacological studies. Ro 15-1788 has little or no affinity for nonneuronal binding sites in the CNS. Ro 15-1788 binding does not displace GABA from its own binding site but does compete for all major Bzd ligands that act as pharmacological agonists and inverse agonists of the Bzd receptor through which anticonvulsant and convulsant effects are expressed. Bzd agonists elevated the threshold for somatic activation, depressed spontaneous activity, and decreased RF size. One exception in this regard was midazolam, which sometimes decreased somatic thresholds and increased spontaneous discharges. These latter effects were reversed at higher doses of the agonist. BMI returned RFs to control sizes when the drug was administered concurrently with Bzd agonists, or it caused RFs to assume greater than normal sizes, depending on the strength of current ejecting the antagonist. Ro 15-1788 given alone decreased response thresholds, increased spontaneous firing, and sometimes enlarged RFs. This antagonist also reversed the RF size-decreasing action of flu, diazepam, and midazolam. Quantitative analyses of air-puffer responses evoked from low-threshold, S1 cells revealed that Bzds do not selectively attenuate spatial summation, but that they act preferentially in the surround, or in the peripheral, regions of cutaneous excitatory RFs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "60": "The novel anxiolytic drug buspirone and its analogues, gepirone and ipsapirone, have behavioral effects that differ substantially from those of other anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates. In particular, buspirone does not consistently produce large increases in rates of responding suppressed by punishment in rodents or primates. To study the effects of buspirone and other compounds on suppressed operant responding in rats, two procedures were used. In the first, food-reinforced responding was suppressed during a stimulus associated with response-produced electric shocks (punishment). Chlordiazepoxide produced large increases in rates of punished responding, but neither buspirone nor ipsapirone gave rise to a similar effect. In a second experiment, food-reinforced responding was suppressed during a stimulus that terminated with an unavoidable shock (conditioned emotional response). Chlorodiazepoxide and clorazepate increased suppressed response rates at low doses and decreased nonsuppressed responding at higher doses, giving rise to dose-related increases in suppression ratios. The effects of buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone were similar to those of the benzodiazepines with ipsapirone producing particularly marked increases in responding during the pre-shock stimulus. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not consistently give rise to the same effect. In addition, similar effects were not produced by haloperidol, imipramine, morphine or idazoxan. Haloperidol and morphine decreased nonsuppressed responding without changing rates of suppressed responding or suppression ratios. Imipramine decreased rates of both nonsuppressed and suppressed responding and idazoxan decreased suppression ratios. The conditioned emotional response procedure may be more sensitive for assessing the behavioral effects of buspirone and similar anxiolytic drugs in rats than are punishment procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "The authors compared tracheal intubating conditions using three techniques for rapid-sequence orotracheal intubation. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: priming with vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg priming dose, 4-min priming interval, 0.14-mg/kg intubating dose along with thiopental 4-6 mg iv); timing with vecuronium (0.15-mg/kg intubating dose given before thiopental and timed to weakness of hand grip); and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). Blinded intubators graded intubating conditions 60 s after the induction of anesthesia with thiopental. Intubation scores in the succinylcholine group were significantly better than in the priming group (P = 0.009). Intubation scores of the succinylcholine and the timing groups were not significantly different. Use of the timing principle for rapid-sequence orotracheal intubation is a reliable alternative in cases where succinylcholine is contraindicated.", 
    "62": "Mechanisms of neural (vagal and cholinergic) and hormonal [cholecystokinin (CCK)] control of pancreatic exocrine secretion were studied in basal interdigestive conditions and after stimulation by an intraduodenal meal in rats equipped with a semichronic pancreatic fistula. Bile was recirculated into the duodenum, and a solution of trypsin and electrolytes was continuously infused. Pancreatic secretion was compared in control experiments, after vagotomy, and after venous infusion of cholinergic and CCK antagonists. Basal pancreatic secretion was decreased by atropine, pirenzepine, and hexamethonium and to a lesser extent by vagotomy (protein output decreased more than fluid and HCO3- outputs). The CCK antagonists L364,718 and lorglumide had no effect on basal interdigestive pancreatic secretion. Small doses of atropine (8 and 25 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) did not modify the cumulated pancreatic response to the meal, whereas larger doses (75 and 225 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) increased it by 40-85%, according to the variables. Pirenzepine and hexamethonium did not modify the pancreatic response. Vagotomy had no effect on fluid and HCO3- responses and tended to increase protein response. L364,718 and lorglumide completely inhibited the protein response and decreased the fluid and HCO3- responses by 75 and 40%, respectively. L364,718 also suppressed the increased pancreatic response induced by atropine. This work confirms the prominent role of neural cholinergic mechanisms in the control of basal interdigestive pancreatic secretion in rats. In contrast, the pancreatic protein response to an intraduodenal meal depends on CCK, whereas fluid and HCO3- responses also depend on other hormonal factors. Our results suggest that a muscarinic (probably M3) mechanism can decrease the postprandial CCK release independently of the pancreatic feedback control by trypsin.", 
    "63": "The Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) levels were studied under stress-reaction condition and after diazepam and N6-cyclohexyladenosine injections. The radioimmune method was used to study the DBI levels. It was shown, that DBI level increased during stress-reaction. Diazepam and N6-cyclohexyladenosine injection decreased DBI level in these conditions. On the basis of these data the authors proposed the hypothetic model of interaction between adenosine receptors and GABA-Benzodiazepine-receptor complex.", 
    "64": "Human serum albumin was non-enzymatically glycated in vitro and the glycation rate determined using an affinity chromatography method. The influence of glycation on the binding of the model ligand, dansylsarcosine, at the benzodiazepine binding site was determined with a stopped-flow method. Fluorescence time curves were recorded during the binding process. As the glycation rate increased, the association velocity constant, k2, decreased from 533.3 s-1 (glycated albumin 0.048 of total serum albumin) to 218.1 s-1 (glycated albumin 0.158 of total serum albumin). The affinity constant, KA, showed a corresponding decrease from 7.61 x 10(5) l/mol (fraction of glycated albumin 0.048) to 2.60 x 10(5) l/mol (fraction of glycated albumin 0.158). The dissociation velocity constant, however, increased from 17.3 s-1 (fraction of glycated albumin 0.048) to 19.8 s-1 (fraction of glycated albumin 0.158). The inhibition of binding probably occurs via an allosteric mechanism.", 
    "65": "Several lines of evidence indicate a possible interaction between the major inhibitory and excitatory cortical neurotransmitters, GABA and glutamate. To assess the neurochemical basis for such an interaction, we examined the effects of glutamate and several analogs on GABA-dependent chloride uptake in a mouse cortical synaptoneurosome preparation. L-Glutamate and the specific receptor subtype ligands kainate and quisqualate led to a small but significant enhancement in chloride uptake in the presence, but not the absence, of the GABA analog muscimol (5 microM). Enhancement was seen at excitatory amino acid (EAA) concentrations of 2-10 microM, but not at higher concentrations. D-Glutamate, NMDA, the NMDA-related antagonists APV and MK801, and the kainate/quisqualate antagonist CNQX, had no effect on chloride uptake. However, CNQX (50 microM) but not APV (50 microM) blocked the increase in chloride uptake due to kainate or quisqualate (10 microM). In addition, depolarization of synaptoneurosomes using high potassium (40 mM KC1) or ouabain pretreatment (5 microM) blocked the effects of kainate and quisqualate. Glutamate, kainate, and quisqualate had no effect on binding at the benzodiazepine, TBPS, or GABA sites on the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "66": "Small angle x-ray scattering has been used to investigate the structure of synaptoneurosomal (SNM) membranes from rat cerebral cortex. Electron micrographs of the preparation showed SNM with classical synaptic appositions intact, other vesicles, occasional mitochondria, and some myelin. An immunoassay for myelin basic protein placed the myelin content of normal rat SNM at less than 2% by weight of the total membrane present. X-Ray diffraction patterns showed five diffraction orders with a unit cell repeat for the membrane of 71 to 78 A at higher hydration states. At lower hydration, 11 orders appeared; the unit cell repeat was 130 A, indicating that the unit cell contained two membranes. Electron density profiles for the 130-A unit cell were determined; they clearly showed the two opposed asymmetrical membranes of the SNM vesicles. SNM membrane/buffer partition coefficients (Kp) of imidazobenzodiazepine and 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel drugs were measured; Kp's for DHP drugs were approximately five times higher in rabbit light sarcoplasmic reticulum than in SNM. Ro 15-1788 and the DHP BAY K 8644 bind primarily to the outer monolayer of vesicles of intact SNM membranes. Nonspecific equilibrium binding of Ro 15-1788 occurs mainly in the upper acyl chain of the bilayer in lipid extracts of SNM membrane.", 
    "67": "The effect of McN-A-343 and oxotremorine on acetylcholine (ACh) release and choline (Ch) transport was studied in corticocerebral synaptosomes of the guinea pig. The synaptosomes were preloaded with [3H]Ch after treatment with the irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and then tested for their ability to release isotope-labeled ACh and Ch in the presence and absence of these agents. The kinetics of release were determined at the resting state (basal release) and in the presence of 50 mM K+. Under either condition, McN-A-343 enhanced the release of isotope-labeled ACh, whereas oxotremorine inhibited the K(+)-evoked release but had no effect on the basal release. The enhancing effect of McN-A-343 on basal ACh release was fully blocked by the selective M1 muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine (100 nM). In contrast to its enhancing effect on ACh release, McN-A-343 potently inhibited Ch efflux as well as Ch influx. These effects were not blocked by atropine, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist. Oxotremorine had no effect on Ch transport. Binding studies showed that McN-A-343 was 3.6-fold more potent in displacing radiolabeled quinuclidinyl benzilate from cerebral cortex muscarinic receptors (mostly M1 subtype) than from cerebellar receptors (mostly M2 subtype), whereas oxotremorine was 2.6-fold more potent in the cerebellum. The displacements of radio-labeled pirenzepine and cis-dioxolane confirmed the M1 subtype preference of McN-A-343 and the M2 subtype preference of oxotremorine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "We compared gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated currents and their modulation by benzodiazepines in cultured human cells transfected with complementary desoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) encoding different GABAA receptor subunits. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist which potentiates GABA responses in both neurons and astrocytes was only effective in receptors containing the gamma 2 subunit (alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 and alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2). The beta-carboline methyl-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) decreased GABA-activated currents in receptors composed of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 subunits but increased GABA-activated currents in receptors containing the alpha 5 subunit (alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2). These results strongly suggest that flunitrazepam and DMCM do not act on isosteric sites and that differences in the responsiveness of GABAA receptors to these compounds are based on different subunit compositions of GABAA receptors.", 
    "69": "Raising the assay [K+] from 6 to 18 mM enhances the inositol phospholipid breakdown response to carbachol in rat brain miniprisms. In the frontal cortex, the degree of enhancement by K+ was independent of the carbachol concentration used, whereas in the striatum, a significantly higher degree of enhancement was seen at 1000 than at 50 microM carbachol. The carbachol-stimulated inositol phospholipid breakdown was antagonized by pirenzepine at both [K+] with potencies suggesting involvement of M1-type muscarinic receptors in the frontal cortex and both M1- and M2-type muscarinic receptors in the striatum. It is suggested that the response mediated by the M1-type receptors is enhanced to a greater degree by raised [K+] than that mediated by the M2-type receptors.", 
    "70": "The cloned cDNAs encoding the alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of the bovine brain GABA(A) receptor have been co-transfected, using a dexamethasone-inducible promoter, into cultured hamster ovary cells, with selection to form a stable cell line. The use, alternatively, of a much stronger constitutive promoter led to cell death consequent upon high receptor density. After induction, the cells contained the alpha 1 and beta 1 mRNAs. The expressed receptors showed the high-affinity binding of [3H]muscimol and of the GABA(A) receptor channel blocker, t-butylphosphorothionate (TBPS), and the characteristic enhancement of the former by a pregnanolone. Their GABA-activated current was potentiated by the barbiturate, pentobarbitone, was reversibly blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin, but was not enhanced by benzodiazepines. In mouse spinal cord neurons GABA activates channel openings to at least four conductance states (45, 30, 19 and 12 pS) with the 30 pS state being the most frequently observed (main) state. However, the main state of the alpha 1/beta 1 GABA(A) receptor was the 19 pS state. The enhancement of GABA(A) receptor current by barbiturates wa due to prolongation of mean channel lifetime, whereas the reduction of GABA(A) receptor current by picrotoxin was due to reduction of channel opening frequency and mean channel lifetime. Stable cell lines containing subunit combinations of this receptor should provide a powerful tool for the elucidation of its channel features and control mechanisms.", 
    "71": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and an understanding of the development of receptors for this compound is of considerable interest. In this study, 3 monoclonal antibodies directed against the GABAA/benzodiazepine (GABA/BDZ) receptor were utilized in immunocytochemical experiments to localize receptor sites on neurons in dissociated cultures from fetal rat hypothalamus. Immunoreactivity was restricted to distinct patches on the plasma membrane of neurons. Analogous patches were observed on the surface of type 1 astrocytes, but not on type 2 astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. In membrane extracts from whole brain these antibodies reacted with two proteins (50 and 55 kDa) whereas extracts of cultured astrocytes yielded a single protein of approximately 63 kDa. Thus the identity of the glial protein remains unclear, but this study provides evidence for the presence of shared epitopes of the GABA/BDZ-receptor on both neurons and glia, and suggests that the astrocytic receptors may be important to nervous system function. Moreover it indicates that in vitro GABA/BDZ-receptors may form aggregates which would account for the restricted patterns of GABA sensitivity reported in some electrophysiological studies.", 
    "72": "The present study examined the effect of systemic post-training administration of the acetylcholine muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 on the acquisition of two 8-arm radial maze tasks. On a win-stay visual discrimination task, a light cue signalled the location of food in 4 randomly selected maze arms, and rats were required to visit each of the 4 lit arms twice within a trial. Rats were given one trial per day and injected immediately post-training on day 5. AF-DX 116 (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) significantly improved win-stay acquisition relative to vehicle-injected controls. On a win-shift task, rats were allowed to visit 4 randomly selected maze arms, followed by a delay period. After the delay, rats were returned to the maze for a retention test in which only those 4 arms not visited prior to the delay contained food. On the test (i.e. drug) trial, rats were removed from the maze after the first 4 choices and injected with AF-DX 116 or vehicle. The retention test was given following an 18 h delay. AF-DX 116 (2.0 mg/kg) significantly improved retention relative to vehicle controls. When the injections were given 2 h post-training, no effect on retention was observed in either task. The results demonstrate that post-training injection of the selective M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 improves memory in a time-dependent manner. The findings may have implications for the cholinergic pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "73": "We studied the expression and distribution of the polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) in rat peripheral organs by immunocytochemistry, radioimmunoassay, Northern blot analysis and binding assay. Variable amounts of the DBI peptide and DBI mRNA were found in all the tissues examined (liver, duodenum, testis, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, ovary, lung, skeletal muscle and spleen), with the highest level of expression in liver (220 pmol of DBI/mg protein) and the lowest in spleen (11 pmol of DBI/mg protein). A good correlation between DBI-like immunoreactivity (DBI-LI) and mRNA content was found in all tissues except the heart. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed discrete localization of DBI-LI in cell types with specialized functions: for example, the highest DBI-LI content was found in steroid-producing cells (glomerulosa and fasciculata cells of adrenal cortex, Leydig cells of testis); lower DBI-LI immunostaining was found in epithelial cells specialized for water and electrolyte transport (intestinal mucosa, distal convoluted tubules of kidney). Hepatic cells contained moderate immunoreactivity however the total content of DBI in liver is relatively high and is due to the diffuse presence of DBI in every hepatocyte. Cells with high expression of DBI have been shown to contain a high density of mitochondrial benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites. This observation led us to perform a competitive binding assay between DBI and [3H]PK11195 (a ligand for the mitochondrial BZ binding sites) on mitochondrial membranes of adrenal cortical cells. In this experiment, DBI yielded an apparent competitive inhibition of the binding of PK11195 to the BZ binding sites. Our data support a possible role for DBI as endogenous regulator of intracellular metabolic functions, such as steroidogenesis, via the mitochondrial BZ receptors.", 
    "74": "Animal lines selected for differences in drug sensitivity can be used to help determine the molecular basis of drug action. Long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice differ markedly in their genetic sensitivity to ethanol. To investigate the molecular basis for this difference, mRNA from brains of LS and SS mice was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the ethanol sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)- and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated ion channels was tested. Ethanol facilitated GABA responses in oocytes injected with mRNA from LS mice but antagonized responses in oocytes injected with mRNA from SS animals. Ethanol inhibited NMDA responses equally in the two lines. Thus, genes coding for the GABAA receptor or associated proteins may be critical determinants of individual differences in ethanol sensitivity.", 
    "75": "The interaction of ethanol with GABAB-receptor system and the selectivity of phaclofen for GABA-receptor subtypes were investigated by employing an in vitro model of 36Cl-influx assay in mammalian cultured neurons and also in vivo models of picrotoxin- and NMDA-induced convulsions in rats. Ethanol (20 mM), without having any effect per se, potentiated the effect of GABA on 36Cl-influx, whereas at concentration 50 mM, ethanol activated Cl(-)-channels directly in mice spinal cord cultured neurons. In contrast, (-)baclofen (100 microM) did not modify the effects of GABA or ethanol on 36Cl-influx. Similarly, phaclofen (500 microM), as well as pertussis toxin (140 ng/ml, overnight incubation) did not modify these effects. Interestingly, phaclofen (200 micrograms i.c.v.) reversed the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol, but not that of pentobarbital or diazepam or progabide, against picrotoxin-induced convulsions in rats. However, phaclofen failed to modify the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol against NMDA-induced convulsions. These observations indicate that phaclofen is devoid of GABAA-receptor blockade property, and the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol against picrotoxin may be mediated through the activation of both GABA-receptor subtypes.", 
    "76": "We examined the involvement of GABAergic neuronal systems in benzodiazepine-induced passive avoidance deficit. Chlordiazepoxide impaired the passive avoidance response dose dependently when it was given prior to training. Post-training administration of muscimol improved the performance of chlordiazepoxide-pretreated mice. The effects of muscimol were antagonized completely by the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, scopolamine, but not by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, when the latter was administered immediately after training. It appears from these results that the GABAergic neuronal system plays an important role in the benzodiazepine-induced passive avoidance deficit by interacting with the cholinergic neuronal system.", 
    "77": "In the present paper, findings on the use of ketamine/xylazine, ketamine/midazolam, tiletamine/zolazepam, and medetomidine following intramuscular injection in dogs are reported. The combined use of ketamine/xylazine induced anaesthesia, the duration of which was thirty minutes. Untoward side-effects were not observed. Administration of tiletamine/zolazepam failed to induce a surgical level of anaesthesia. Recovery was prolonged. In this group, five out of the ten dogs showed signs of post-anaesthetic muscle spasms. Neither the combination ketamine/midazolam nor medetomidine induced a surgical level of anaesthesia. Post-anesthetic muscle spasms were a frequently observed side-effect when the combination ketamine/midazolam was administered. The use of medetomidine resulted in a qualitatively satisfactory and prolonged sedation.", 
    "78": "The interactions of tandospirone (formerly called SM-3997) with 5-HT and other neurotransmitter receptor binding sites were determined in brain homogenates. Tandospirone is most potent at the 5-HT1A receptor, displaying a Ki value of 27 +/- 5 nM. The agent is approximately two to three orders of magnitude less potent at 5-HT2, 5-HT1C, alpha 1-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic, and dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (Ki values ranging from 1300 to 41000 nM). Tandospirone is essentially inactive at 5-HT1B receptors; 5-HT uptake sites; beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. This pharmacological profile differs slightly from that of other novel anxiolytics such as buspirone, ipsapirone, and gepirone. Saturation and competition studies using 3H-tandospirone also suggest that the drug interacts with 5-HT1A receptor binding sites in rat cortical membranes (KD = 4.5 +/- 0.8 nM; Bmax = 2.2 +/- 0.6 pmol/g tissue). Based on adenylate cyclase studies which measure 5-HT1A receptor-mediated effects, tandospirone displays approximately 60% of the agonist effect of 8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A agonist. Thus, the primary pharmacological effect of tandospirone appears to be partial agonism at the 5-HT1A receptor, an activity similar to other pyrimidinyl-piperazines which are being developed as novel anxiolytic agents.", 
    "79": "Body fluids from patients with hepatic encephalopathy and from controls with no renal or hepatic disease were assayed for benzodiazepine immunoreactivity and benzodiazepine-receptor-binding activity. The subjects had taken no synthetic benzodiazepines for at least 3 months. Benzodiazepine receptor binding in cerebrospinal fluid was significantly higher in hepatic encephalopathy patients than in controls (210 [SE 50.2] vs 40.7 [7.3] oxazepam equivalents [ng/ml]). The severity of hepatic encephalopathy was directly and significantly correlated with the level of benzodiazepine activity by radioreceptor assay or radioimmunoassay in urine and in plasma. Benzodiazepine activity equivalent to levels of more than 900 ng/ml was found in patients with advanced encephalopathy. Although the chemical identity and source of this substance (or substances) are still unknown, its properties and the estimated levels of activity suggest it may have a role in the pathogenesis of the neural inhibition seen in hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "80": "The effects of several beta-carboline derivatives on sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) were investigated in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex. HACU was measured in synaptosomal preparations from these areas after in vivo administration of the drugs. The convulsant, picrotoxin (6 mg/kg), stimulated HACU in both hippocampal and cortical synaptosomes. The convulsant inverse agonist benzodiazepine, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (5 mg/kg) stimulated hippocampal but not cortical HACU. However, other inverse agonists, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) (20 mg/kg) and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) (20 mg/kg), stimulated HACU in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. The partial inverse agonist, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (FG-7142) (20 mg/kg), inhibited cortical HACU and had no effect on hippocampal HACU. The antagonist beta-carboline, 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline (3-HMC) (20 mg/kg), had no effect on either cortical or hippocampal HACU. None of these drugs displayed any effect on HACU when they were incubated directly in vitro with synaptosomal preparations at concentrations up to 100 microM, suggesting their activity is not directly on the cholinergic nerve terminal. The results suggest that beta-carbolines regulate hippocampal and cortical cholinergic activity as do other GABAergic drugs. However, unlike diazepam, which depresses cholinergic activity in both the hippocampus and the cortex the beta-carbolines differentiate between the hippocampus and cortex in their action.",

Twice daily for 14 days, 7-day-old neonatal rats received an oral gavage of either 2.5 mg/kg or 5.0 mg/kg of the potent and specific CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718 (the 2.5 mg/kg dose of antagonist was shown in the present study to abolish totally the pancreas growth-promoting effects of exogenously administered caerulein (CR) in neonatal rats). Control pups received oral gavages of the L-364,718 vehicle alone. The final body weights, pancreas weights, total pancreatic DNA contents, and total pancreatic protein contents did not differ significantly between the 21-day-old control pups and the 21-day-old pups that were pretreated for 14 days with either the low or the high doses of L-364,718. These findings suggest that endogenous CCK is not required for growth of the neonatal rat pancreas.", 
    "82": "The effects of luminal bile salts on plasma levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) and growth of the pancreas in mice were studied. Nonfasting levels of plasma CCK in control mice were 8.1 +/- 1.5 pM. Feeding mice a 0.5% (wt/wt) sodium taurocholate-supplemented diet for 1 wk significantly lowered nonfasting levels of plasma CCK to 4.1 +/- 0.5 pM and decreased the total contents of pancreatic DNA by 22%, RNA by 25%, and protein by 24%. All of the inhibitory effects of taurocholate on pancreatic growth were completely reversed by the simultaneous administration of CCK-8 (3 micrograms/kg, 3 times daily). In contrast, intraluminal neutralization of endogenous bile salts by feeding a 4% (wt/wt) cholestyramine-supplemented diet for 1 wk significantly elevated nonfasting levels of plasma CCK to 14.7 +/- 1.5 pM and increased the total contents of pancreatic DNA by 34%, RNA by 40%, and protein by 35%. All of the stimulatory actions of cholestyramine on pancreatic growth were completely abolished by the administration of the highly potent and specific CCK-receptor antagonist L364,718 (1 mg/kg, twice daily). These findings, therefore, indicate that bile salts appear to play a physiological role in pancreatic growth by regulation of plasma levels of CCK.", 
    "83": "Various kinds of DNA damage block the 3' to 5' exonuclease action of both E. coli exonuclease III and T4 DNA polymerase. This study shows that a variety of DNA damage likewise inhibits DNA digestion by lambda exonuclease, a 5' to 3' exonuclease. The processive degradation of DNA by the enzyme is blocked if the substrate DNA is treated with ultraviolet irradiation, anthramycin, distamycin, or benzo[a]-pyrene diol epoxide. Furthermore, as with the 3' to 5' exonucleases, the enzyme stops at discrete sites which are different for different DNA damaging agents. On the other hand, digestion of treated DNA by lambda exonuclease is only transiently inhibited at guanine residues alkylated with the acridine mustard ICR-170. The enzyme does not bypass benzo[a]-pyrene diol epoxide or anthramycin lesions even after extensive incubation. While both benzo[a]-pyrene diol epoxide and ICR-170 alkylate the guanine N-7 position, only benzo[a]-pyrene diol epoxide also reacts with the guanine N-2 position in the minor groove of DNA. Anthramycin and distamycin bind exclusively to sites in the minor groove of DNA. Thus lambda exonuclease may be particularly sensitive to obstructions in the minor groove of DNA; alternatively, the enzyme may be blocked by some local helix distortion caused by these adducts, but not by alkylation at guanine N-7 sites.", 
    "84": "The measurement of cortical omega 3 (peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding) site densities provides an accurate index for the detection and quantification of ischaemic brain lesions following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. Here, we have used this marker to assess the neuroprotective activity of potential anti-ischaemic drugs belonging to several chemical classes. In untreated mice, the mean infarcted volume measured 96 h after unilateral coagulation of the middle cerebral artery was 27.9 +/- 4.3 mm3 (17.5% of the hemisphere volume) and omega 3 site densities (measured by incubation with 3H-PK 11195) were increased by 107.3 +/- 4.8% (cortical homogenates) or by 81% (coronal brain sections). The administration of the anti-ischaemic agent SL 82.0715 (10 mg/kg i.p.), 5 min, 6 h and 18 h after the occlusion and then twice daily until sacrifice evoked a decrease of similar magnitude (ca. 60-70%) in the volume of the infarction and in the proliferation of omega 3 sites. The constant tissue sparing effect of SL 82.0715 allowed the examination of the window of therapeutic opportunity. A significant diminution of cortical omega 3 sites was still noted when the first administration was delayed until 3 h post-occlusion. Moreover, the protective effect of SL 82.0715 was enhanced by repeated treatment for the first 36 h but not thereafter. Based on the histological, autoradiographic and homogenate binding results obtained with SL 82.0715, we studied the protective effects of several competitive and non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists. When administered according to the above-described standard protocol, these drugs reduced omega 3 site levels in cortical homogenates from MCAO mice in a dose-dependent manner. The dose preventing by 50% the increase in omega 3 site levels (in mg/kg i.p.) and the maximal inhibition were respectively: MK-801 (0.2, 93%); TCP (1.6, 66%); kynurenate (260, 58%); ifenprodil (7.0, 58%); SL 82.0715 (1.1, 72%); CGS 19755 (46% at 10 mg/kg); dextromethorphan (46% at 30 mg/kg). In contrast, agents acting preferentially upon sigma (sigma) opiate receptors ((+)-3PPP, 1-10 mg/kg i.p. and haloperidol, 0.3-3 mg/kg i.p.) did not provide a significant protection. In general, calcium channel blockers (nimodipine, flunarizine, verapamil, perhexiline, diltiazem) were devoid of a clear neuroprotective potential when administered at non-toxic doses after the coagulation of the middle cerebral artery. Diltiazem (3 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) provided a significant protection when the first administration was performed 10 min prior to the occlusion. Limited protection was observed with adenosine A1 receptor agonists (N6-cyclohexyladenosine and 2-chloro-adenosine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "85": "Previous investigations have indicated that the detection and quantification of omega 3 (peripheral type benzodiazepine) binding site densities that are associated with reactive astroglia and macrophages could be of widespread applicability in the localization and indirect assessment of neural tissue damage in the central nervous system. In the present study, we analyze the usefulness of this approach in a number of experimental models that are characterized by (or putatively involve) neuronal degeneration. One week after the systemic administration of the excitotoxin, kainate, a marked increase in omega 3 site densities (as assessed by [3H]PK 11195 binding) was noted, an increase that was most prominent in known regions of selective vulnerability (hippocampus and septum). However, the kainate-induced omega 3 site proliferation was not a function of the dose administered, a marked interstudy variation was observed, and the binding increase was prevented by the administration of the anticonvulsant, clonazepam. The densities of omega 3 sites were studied, by autoradiography (using [3H]PK 11195 or [3H]PK 14105 as ligands), in 4 groups of Fischer 344 rats aged 3, 12, 22 and 30 months. No age-related changes were noted except in the 30-month-old group in which discrete and focal increases (reflecting tumoral processes) were observed in various brain regions. In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats, omega 3 binding increases were observed concomitant with the development of stroke-related neurological signs. With autoradiography, the omega 3 site increase was localized to focal increases in the boundary zones between major cerebral arteries (and corresponding to regions of ischaemic or haemorrhagic infarction). Focal cerebral ischaemia was studied in rats and mice. Subsequent to middle cerebral artery occlusion in normotensive (Wistar/Kyoto) and spontaneously hypertensive rats, the density of omega 3 sites in the ipsilateral hemisphere was markedly elevated, the increase being greater in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. The increases in omega 3 labelling in these two strains matched the absolute volumes of infarctions, determined previously. Middle cerebral artery occlusion in the mouse also increased hemispheric levels of omega 3 sites; the maximum values were obtained between 4 and 8 days following the induction of focal ischaemia. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using omega 3 sites as a marker of excitotoxic, ischaemic and proliferative damage in the rodent brain. Binding measurement in tissue homogenates is an economic and time-efficient approach, whereas the autoradiographic detection of omega 3 sites allows the localization of brain lesions with a macroscopic or microscopic level of anatomical resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "86": "A review of the prescriptions dispensed by all pharmacists in the County of Arhus during a week in January 1989 resulted in information about 3,212 prescriptions for benzodiazepine hypnotics sedatives by the general practitioners in the county. The majority of prescriptions were for men in the age group 60-69 years and women in the age group 70-79 years. After age standardization, the extent of prescription was found to increase with age to reach extent of 267.1 and 347.9 defined daily dosages (DDD)/1,000 inhabitants/day for men and women, respectively in the age group of 90 years or more. A total of 70.8% of the prescriptions and 81.6% of the prescribed DDD were for preparations with prolonged effects. More of the elderly women than the middle-aged and younger women were prescribed preparations with prolonged effects (p less than 0.01). Prescription of tablets with double doses (2 DDD per tablet) were responsible for 40.4% of the prescribed DDD of hypnotics/sedatives with prolonged effect and 33.0% of the total quantity of medicine calculated in DDD. It is concluded that general practitioners should attempt to reduce the extent of prescription of benzodiazepine hypnotics sedatives and that the registering authorities should investigate the justification of continued registration of preparations with prolonged effects and that ths general public should be informed about how unsuitable employment of sleeping pills can be, except for very brief periods."
