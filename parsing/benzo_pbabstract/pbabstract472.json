    "0": "The effects of dexmedetomidine (DXM), a novel alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on human performance and mood were studied in a double-blind randomized crossover study in 12 healthy student volunteers. Single IM doses of dexmedetomidine, 0.6 microgram/kg (DXM1) and 1.2 micrograms/kg (DXM2), 80 micrograms/kg midazolam (MID) and saline placebo, were given at one-week intervals. Performance was measured objectively and mood was assessed subjectively with visual analogue scales (VAS) at baseline and 40 min, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h after each injection. Blood pressure and heart rate in the sitting position were measured and venous blood was sampled during each testing round. DXM1 did not significantly impair cognitive (digit symbol substitution), coordinative (tracking) or reactive skills, and at 6 h it shortened reaction time and reduced errors in complex tracking. It produced exophoria, increased body sway with the eyes open and impaired subjective performance on VAS. The higher dose dexmedetomidine also caused impaired cognitive, coordinative and reactive skills (although a trend towards improved coordination was found at 6 h), reduced attention, produced exophoria, increased body sway with the eyes open and caused drowsiness, clumsiness, passiveness and mental slowness on the appropriate VAS scales. MID resembled DXM2 in impaired objective and subjective measures of skilled performance, although the objective effects of MID were of speedier onset and shorter duration. In contrast to MID, DXM caused a significant and dose-dependent decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure still detectable 6 h after injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Two cases of intranasal benzodiazepine use are presented. The methods of preparation and administration of the powder and accounts of the pharmacological effects of the drugs used are described. The pattern of development and progress of the habit and its associated features are delineated. Snorting benzodiazepines appears to be more common than is currently appreciated, and the clinical complications and implications of this habit are discussed.", 
    "2": "The possible involvement of GABAergic neuronal systems in benzodiazepine (BZP)-induced impairment of a passive avoidance response was investigated. Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) impaired passive avoidance when administered prior to training. The CDP-induced impairment was antagonized by pretreatment with picrotoxin, but not by pretreatment with bicuculline or post-training administration of picrotoxin. On the contrary, when combined with muscimol, the dose at which CDP impaired the response was lower than the dose at which it did so alone. The synergy of muscimol and CDP was attenuated by pretreatment with flumazenil or bicuculline. From these results, we conclude that GABAergic systems play an important role in the BZP-induced impairment of passive avoidance.", 
    "3": "The amnestic effects of benzodiazepines (BZs) have attracted considerable research interest. This reflects not only the clinical implications of memory failure for people prescribed these drugs but also the potential of BZs as tools in modelling organic memory problems. As well as impairing certain aspects of human memory functions, BZs affect mood states by reducing anxiety and inducing sedation. An unresolved issue is the extent to which the amnestic effects of BZs are separable from their sedative and anxiolytic effects. The present review focuses on this issue, first presenting a conceptual framework for evaluating the interrelationship between the various effects of BZs, and then summarising recent volunteer and patient research relevant to dissociating amnestic from other effects. Clinical implications are discussed in terms of the use of BZs alone or as adjuncts to psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, and attention is drawn to the need for more ecological validity in psychopharmacological research. Theoretical implications are explored in terms of BZs as tools in studying both memory failure and the relationship between mood and cognition.", 
    "4": "1. Fischer male rats were trained to avoid shock in a shuttle box. After this procedure, a small ECG transmitter was incorporated under the skin of thorax. 2. In saline group, when in the shuttle box heart rate significantly increased, and decreased while exposed to the buzzer. 3. When beta-blocker (carteolol, pindolol, propranolol) was injected, heart rate did not increase after the rat was put in the shuttle box, but decreased after exposed to the buzzer. Change in heart rate was not shown when diazepam was injected. 4. These results indicated that diazepam is more effective than beta-blocker in terms of instability of heart rate in conditioned rats.", 
    "5": "Exposure to high doses of organophosphorus nerve agents such as soman, even with carbamate pretreatment, produces a variety of toxic cholinergic signs, including secretions, convulsions and death. Evidence suggests that soman-induced convulsions may be associated with postexposure brain neuropathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacologic mechanism of action of soman-induced convulsions and of anticonvulsant drugs. Various classes of compounds were evaluated for their efficacy in preventing soman-induced convulsions in rats pretreated with the oxime HI-6 to increase survival time, along with various doses of the test compounds (IM) either in the absence or presence of atropine sulfate (16 mg/kg, IM) 30 minutes prior to a soman challenge dose (180 micrograms/kg, SC; equivalent to 1.6 x LD50) that produced 100% convulsions. Without atropine sulfate, only tertiary anticholinergics (scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, biperiden, benactyzine, benztropine, azaprophen and aprophen), caramiphen, carbetapentane and MK-801 were effective anticonvulsants. In the presence of atropine sulfate, the benzodiazepines (diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, loprazolam and alprazolam), mecamylamine, flunarizine, diphenylhydantoin, clonidine, CGS 19755 and Organon 6370 studied were effective. We have examined the possibility that diazepam may exert some of its anticonvulsant effects through cholinergic mechanisms and found that a reduced release of ACh into synapses after diazepam and atropine treatment may account for diazepam's anticonvulsant activity against soman. We also found that at anticonvulsant doses biperiden and trihexyphenidyl each significantly reversed the effects of soman on striatal levels of DOPAC and HVA, the metabolites of dopamine, and have concluded that in addition to actions on muscarinic receptors, the anticonvulsant effects of these anticholinergics in soman poisoning may be partially related to their actions on the striatal dopaminergic system. These findings allow us to postulate that central muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms are primarily involved in eliciting the convulsions following exposure to soman and that subsequent recruitment of other excitatory neurotransmitter systems and loss of inhibitory control may be responsible for sustaining the convulsions and for producing the subsequent brain damage. Future studies to confirm these neuropharmacological mechanisms are proposed.", 
    "6": "The effect of oxaprotiline (OXA) enantiomers--of which (+)-OXA inhibits noradrenaline (NA) uptake, whereas (-)-OXA does not--on the secretion of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone was studied in rats. Both enantiomers dose-dependently and with a similar potency increased the plasma level of ACTH and corticosterone, the effect of (-)-OXA on corticosterone being of a longer duration. The stimulation of ACTH secretion and the inability of (+)- and (-)-OXA to increase the plasma corticosterone concentration in animals pretreated with dexamethasone indicate that secretion of the latter hormone results from the action of the enantiomers at a level superior to the adrenal cortex, i.e. the hypothalamus/pituitary. The corticosterone response to (+)- or (-)-OXA was not modified in rats with a selective lesion of NA nerve endings induced by the neurotoxin DSP-4, nor was it affected by the selective alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, the selective alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine, the mixed alpha 1/alpha 2-antagonist phentolamine, the selective dopamine (D2) receptor antagonist sulpiride and the non-selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor antagonist metergoline. These results indicate that neither the NA system nor D2 and 5-HT receptors are involved in the hormonal response to the OXA enantiomers. Although the (+)- and (-)-OXA-induced stimulation of corticosterone secretion was not antagonized by diazepam, ipsapirone, naloxone, or propranolol, it cannot be excluded that both these enantiomers act as non-specific stressors.", 
    "7": "This is the first reported controlled trial of a partial benzodiazepine agonist, abecarnil, utilized in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It was a sequential dose-finding study comparing 15-30 mg/day, 7.5-15 mg/day, and 3-9 mg/day to placebo for 3 weeks of treatment followed by abrupt discontinuation through placebo substitution. Although the two higher dose groups had high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) sedative adverse effects, the 3-9 mg/day group tolerated the medication well with no dropouts. The 3-9 mg/day group, in comparison to the two higher doses and placebo, demonstrated efficacy in global improvement ratings and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) scores. At Week 3, 61 percent of the abecarnil 3-9 mg/day group was rated as at least 50 percent improved on the HAM-A, compared to 30 percent of the placebo group. With abrupt discontinuation there were mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms and loss of efficacy in the two higher dose groups. However, in the 3-9 mg/day abecarnil group, there were few withdrawal symptoms and almost no loss of efficacy following discontinuation.", 
    "8": "The effects of oral loprazolam (1, 2 mg) on vigilance, attention, immediate memory, short-term memory, learning, long-term non-consolidated and long-term consolidated memory were determined. Twelve healthy young male volunteers were given all the treatments, placebo or loprazolam, on three different occasions, in a double-blind, random latin-square sequence, crossing over every 2 weeks. Volunteers completed a battery of tests at night, 3.5 h after drug administration, and in the morning, 10 h after drug administration, to test recall of some of the material presented at night (long-term memory) and residual effects. Loprazolam did not significantly impair any of the functions tested at night. On the other hand, 2 mg loprazolam caused impairment of long-term memory, both consolidated and not. This reduction of long-term memory does not seem to be related to the impairments of vigilance, attention or learning. The 2 mg dose of loprazolam, which did not modify the mean scores and improved vigilance, attention and learning in some of the subjects, reduced long-term memory. Therefore, although caution in interpreting the results should be used, mainly because it is possible that differences in sensitivity of the tests cannot be overcome and because the relative small number of subjects, our results indicate that loprazolam might induce selective impairment of long-term memory. Since there were no differences between the effects on consolidated and non-consolidated memory, the amnesic effect of loprazolam seems to be due to a decrease in the storage of memory traces. There were no clear generalized residual effects in the morning after administration.", 
    "9": "Benzodiazepine (BZD) anxiolytics, through their activation of the BZD-GABA receptor complex, display robust anxiolytic-like effects following systemic administration in both conditioned and non-conditioned behavioral procedures. The present results show that the GABAA agonists muscimol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg), THIP (2.5-10.0 mg/kg), and isoguvacine (25.0 mg/kg) as well as the GABA transaminase (GABA-T) inhibitor AOAA (aminooxyacetic acid; 5.0-20.0 mg/kg) following intraperitoneal administration exert anxiolytic-like activity of similar magnitude to that of diazepam in two non-conditioned procedures, namely the social interaction and the elevated plus maze tests. We have also extended our original findings that the anti-epileptic drug sodium valproate exerts an anxiolytic-like effect in the Geller conflict paradigm, to show this agent's robust activity in the social interaction and elevated plus maze tests following systemic administration (100-400 mg/kg). These results show that GABAergic agents that facilitate GABA transmission are effective following systemic administration in non-conditioned anxiety procedures and may indicate potential therapeutic efficacy in certain anxiety states.", 
    "10": "In a previous work, we have shown that GABA inhibits the release of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-melanotropin) from hypothalamic neurons through activation of GABAA receptors [Delbende et al. (1989) Brain Res. 497, 86-93]. Since GABA-gated channel activity can be allosterically modulated by a variety of compounds including benzodiazepines, we have investigated the effect of benzodiazepines in the control of alpha-melanotropin release by the rat basal hypothalamus. This study was conducted in vitro using perifused rat hypothalamic slices and the amount of alpha-melanotropin release was monitored with a sensitive and highly specific radioimmunoassay. Infusion of clonazepam (50 microM), a selective agonist for central-type benzodiazepine binding sites, induced an inhibition of KCl (50 mM)-evoked alpha-melanotropin release. The inhibitory effect of clonazepam was rapid and reversible. Administration of Ro 15-1788 (100 microM), a specific antagonist for central-type benzodiazepine receptors or SR 95531, a GABAA receptor antagonist, completely reversed the inhibitory effect of clonazepam. In addition, Ro 15-1788 and SR 95531 both enhanced the amplitude of the response observed during prolonged KCl infusion on alpha-melanotropin neurons, suggesting the existence of a tonic inhibitory effect of endogenous GABA and/or benzodiazepines in the release of alpha-melanotropin by hypothalamic neurons. To investigate further the effect of benzodiazepines in the regulation of alpha-melanotropin neurons, rats were treated in vivo with clonazepam (5 mg/kg) or the non-selective benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam (3 mg/kg). Both compounds caused a significant increase in the content of alpha-melanotropin and beta-endorphin in the rat hypothalamus within 3 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Injection of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist quinolinate, or N-methyl-D-aspartate itself, into the rat brain produces neurodegeneration which can be prevented by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists administered up to 5 h after excitotoxin injection. The present study was designed to investigate aspects of the mechanisms involved in this delayed form of neurodegeneration. Following its injection into the rat striatum, extracellular levels of [3H]quinolinate were monitored using a microdialysis probe located 1 mm from the site of injection. Peak concentrations were observed 10-20 min after injection and [3H]quinolinate levels decayed in a biexponential fashion, the initial component having an apparent t1/2 of 13.7 +/- 5.2 min (n = 3). Estimations of the extracellular concentrations of quinolinate after an injection of 200 nmol indicated a peak level of 13.7 +/- 6.0 mM (n = 3) at 10-20 min which declined to 1.2 +/- 0.13 mM (n = 3) by 2 h and substantial levels were present up to 5 h, the period over which N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists are effective in this model. Administration of dizocilpine at 1, 2, 3 or 5 h after injection of 100, 200 or 400 nmol quinolinate resulted in a similar temporal profile of neuroprotection, as assessed by measuring the activities of choline acetyltransferase and glutamate decarboxylase in striatal homogenates, which was independent of the degree of neurodegeneration produced by the different excitotoxin doses. Overall, these results suggest that the neuronal degeneration caused by quinolinate in vivo is critically dependent upon events occurring after the initial peak of excitoxin levels in the extracellular space.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "The effects of hypnotics on descriptive and functional aspects of electrophysiological sleep parameters are assessed in this report. Because of the arbitrary definition of some of the criteria underlying the conventional sleep stage scoring procedure, computer-aided methods of EEG analysis have become increasingly important for recording and interpreting pharmacological effects on sleep. Of particular interest are the changes of EEG slow-wave activity, since this parameter varies as a function of prior sleep and waking. Several types of interaction between hypnotics and sleep regulation are discussed, some recent pharmacological developments are highlighted, and some common problems in clinical trials are specified.", 
    "13": "As part of a larger project on the effects of benzodiazepine and caffeine on daytime sleepiness, performance and mood, this study examined the relationship among the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, lapses during a tapping task, a Visual Analog Scale, and the Stanford Sleepiness scale. Subjects were 80 male, adult nonsmokers aged 20.3 +/- 2.7 years. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and the Visual Analog Scale were obtained at two-hour intervals beginning at 0700 h and ending at 1700 h. The tapping task (lapses) was administered each day at 0600 h, 1000 h, and 1400 h. A lapse was a 3-s or greater pause between taps. Correlations between the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and subjective (Visual Analog Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale) measures were significant at 0600 h, but became nonsignificant as the day progressed. Correlations between lapses and the two subjective measures were generally nonsignificant. The two objective measures were significantly correlated in the total group but not in all treatment groups. The subjective measures were significantly correlated in the total sample and in each treatment group. This study reaffirms the importance of time of day when measuring sleepiness, and suggests that subjective and objective measures may measure different aspects of sleepiness.", 
    "14": "Many patients with schizophrenia continue to have significant disabling symptoms despite adequate trials of different types and doses of traditional neuroleptics. Clinicians treating these neuroleptic-resistant patients must look to other treatments in the hope of providing some relief. The literature on many of the alternative treatments is too scanty for firm conclusions. We offer criteria for deciding which treatments may warrant consideration. We review the evidence for the eight treatments we found to meet these criteria and discuss clinical points salient to their use in this population. Although not always conclusive, the data do offer clues for treatment guidelines and an approach to choosing among the available treatments is suggested.", 
    "15": "It is well known that benzodiazepines produce dependence in humans and locomotor stimulation in experimental animals. In this study the possible involvement of catecholamines in the diazepam-induced locomotor stimulation in mice were investigated. Diazepam was found to have a biphasic effect; increasing locomotor activity at a low dose (0.25 mg/kg), while decreasing it at higher doses (greater than 0.5 mg/kg). The locomotor stimulating effect of diazepam was effectively blocked by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, as well as with the catecholamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyltryrosine and the dopamine receptor antagonists haloperidol, spiperone and SCH 23390. Taken together, these data indicate that the locomotor stimulating effect observed after low doses of diazepam is due to activation of brain dopaminergic systems involved in locomotor activity. The observations are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that dependence-producing drugs activate specific brain reward systems.", 
    "16": "The aim of the study was to determine the effect of repeated oral administration of ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, on psychomotor performance. The study was of a randomised, double-blind, four-way, cross-over design in 12 healthy subjects, with 1 mg and 8 mg ondansetron, placebo and 2 mg lorazepam evaluated. Each subject received five administrations per treatment period. Ondansetron, 1 mg and 8 mg, and placebo were given as twice daily dosing for 2 1/2 days. Lorazepam was administered as a 2 mg single oral dose which was taken as the fifth administration; placebo was given for the remaining four doses. Within each treatment period, subjects underwent a baseline (pre-dose) assessment of psychomotor performance using four commonly used and validated psychomotor tests, and were then re-assessed after the fifth and final dose over a 7-h, post-dose period. Following dosing with lorazepam, statistically significant changes were seen in five of the six test variables compared with placebo. Ondansetron, at both the 1 mg and the 8 mg doses, did not produce a statistically significant effect on any measure of psychomotor performance compared with placebo.", 
    "17": "The effects of metadoxine (pyrrolidone carboxylate of pyridoxine), a compound with central benzodiazepine-like properties, were evaluated in two groups of chronic alcoholics (inpatients) presenting a mild withdrawal syndrome. According to a double-blind study design 20 patients received metadoxine 900 mg twice daily eluted in 500 ml of saline infusion, while 20 (the control group) were given 500 ml of saline infusion twice daily with equivalent doses of pyridoxine (40 mg/die) every morning over a 10-day period. The results indicate that metadoxine treatment was able to control alcohol abstinence, thus allowing a reduction in the needs for standard benzodiazepine therapy. The central activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid of this compound might play a crucial role in the clinical effects demonstrated.", 
    "18": "Fifty consecutive patients were studied prospectively to assess the effects of a continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam hydrochloride for sedation in patients requiring intensive care. Patient comfort was acceptable in all patients. However, to maintain the same degree of sedation it was necessary to increase the daily dose of midazolam indicating that benzodiazepine tolerance may have been developing. The time taken to awaken following cessation of a midazolam infusion was prolonged in some patients. In those patients with renal failure the mean (+/- SD) value was 44.6 +/- 42.5 h compared to patients without renal failure in whom it was 13.6 +/- 16.4 h (P less than 0.01). Two patients with combined hepatic and renal failure took 124 and 140 h to awaken. Continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam offers good patient comfort but increasing dose requirements in critically ill patients may lead to drug accumulation and delayed awakening. The risks of cumulation may be increased if the drug is given by continuous infusion for prolonged periods without intermittent assessment of the patient's conscious state.",

During 6 consecutive weeks, alternate medication was given. 2. Severity of panic and anxiety attacks was improved only in patients receiving sodium divalproex as a first medication. 3. Protracted benzodiazepine effects may occur in the dichotomous antipanic activity of sodium divalproex.", 
    "20": "1. The behavioural effects of classical anxiolytics such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines have been well characterised. However, recent research has been aimed at the development of novel anxiolytics without problems of sedation, muscle relaxation, amnesia and dependence. 2. A number of novel omega (benzodiazepine) receptor ligands with anxiolytic properties have been described including alpidem, bretazenil, suriclone and abecarnil. Although these compounds share some behavioural effects with older anxiolytic drugs, such as increasing punished drinking, they also show many differences. Their novel profiles may be related to low intrinsic activity or to selectivity for omega receptor subtypes. 3. The possibility that novel anxiolytics may be found among compounds active at serotonin receptors remains a strong hypothesis. Compounds, which, like buspirone, are active at 5HT1A receptors may be anxiolytic as may be antagonists at 5HT2 and 5HT3 receptors. All these compounds have behavioural effects which differ from those of benzodiazepines. 4. In order more effectively to screen for and develop novel anxiolytics it will be necessary to refine behavioural models in the light of feedback from the clinic.", 
    "21": "The use of benzodiazepines for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a safe and effective treatment; however, their potential to produce dependence and impair psychomotor and cognitive functions is a drawback. In this study the efficacy and safety of alpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine, was assessed. Thirty patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for GAD were randomized to either alpidem (225 mg), lorazepam (4.5 mg), or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine differences in HAM-A scores over time. The results showed a trend for alpidem to be more effective. Half of the alpidem group had a decrease of 50 percent or greater in their HAM-A scores with an almost equal effect on psychic and somatic symptoms. The most common side effects with alpidem and lorazepam were lightheadedness, drowsiness, and daytime tiredness. Moreover, treatment with alpidem did not manifest any withdrawal symptoms. Thus nonbenzodiazepine treatments are effective and safe for GAD.",

With this brief introduction, develops a general strategy for the management of panic disorder that entails careful diagnostic assessment, recognition of the risk of complications (i.e. major depression, phobic avoidance, substance abuse), education, supportive psychotherapy and the use of medication in the acute control of symptoms and the long term management of the vulnerability to panic attacks.", 
    "23": "A pharmacoepidemiological survey was carried out in a rural region of France (Brittany) with the help of 54 general practitioners, all of whom belong to a clinical research group. The aim of the survey was 3-fold: to determine the frequency (incidence and prevalence) of anxiolytic and hypnotic drug prescriptions, the sociological characteristics of these drug consumers, and the indications and reasons for prescribing this class of drugs. The population of hypnotic drug and sedative consumers was strikingly dominated by women, 60 years old and over, retired or without a profession. Prescription analysis revealed that these drugs were essentially benzodiazepines whose prevalence and incidence were 17 and 1.76%, respectively. A high frequency of prescription renewals (78%) and an elevated percentage of long-term treatments (more than 9 years) were also noted. Insomnia and dependence are the two main \"risk factors\" for drug treatments lasting more than one year.", 
    "24": "The following results were obtained in an experimental study in the dogs in general pentobarbital anaesthesia: Lidocaine type antiarrhythmics (lidocaine, Xylocaine ASTRA, Ethmozin USSR) administered shortly before artery ligation have a pro-fibrillation effect. This effect is indirectly proportional to the ischaemic focus development. A 3rd-generation beta blocker with intrinsic sympathetic activity (celiprolol, Selectol Chemie-Linz) had the same electrostabilizing effect on the ventricles in the acute phase of ischaemia as a 1st-generation beta blocker (metipranolol, Trimepranol SPOFA). The 3rd-generation blocker, however, stopped short of provoking a drop in the heart rate invariably associated with the 1st-generation beta blocker. The analgesic fentanyl (G. Richter) in combination with benzodiazepine (m,idazolam, Dormicum Hoffmann-La Roche) inducs analgosedation. In this way the dose of the analgetic can be reduced and yet the analgesia and electrostability of the heart remain the same. Due to the lower dose of the analgesic there is a lesser decrease in the heart rate and blood pressure. Analgosedation can be discontinued by administering an antagonist-agonist of benzodiazepines (flumazenil, Anexate Hoffmann-La Roche) or an antagonist of potent analgesics (butorphanol, Beforal SPOFA) without the risk of eliminating, at the same time, the electrostabilizing effect of analgosedation on the ischaemically damaged ventricles of the heart. For the prevention of sudden coronary death due to ventricular fibrillation in the acute phase of local myocardial ischaemia we can, on the basis of our experimental results, recommend analgosedation and the use of beta blockers with intristic sympathetic action. The use of lidocaine antiarrhythmics may lead to a reduction in the electric stability of the heart ventricles the ischaemic focus is developing under a certain \"critical\" blood level of the antiarrhythmics.",

After describing the techniques used in positron emission tomography to characterize a ligand receptor binding and discussing the choice of the label and the limitations and complexities of the in vivo approach, the results obtained in the PET studies of various neurotransmission systems: dopaminergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, serotonin and cholinergic systems are reviewed.", 
    "26": "It has been reported that dipyridamole and some benzodiazepines potentiate the responses to adenosine in peripheral organs and in particular in the guinea pig isolated atria or trachea by inhibition of adenosine uptake and/or metabolism. In this study, we have examined the sensitization of guinea pig isolated trachea to relaxant responses to adenosine produced by dipyridamole, diazepam and 3 compounds chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines but which display selective agonistic activity towards the central (zolpidem and zopiclone) or peripheral (alpidem) type benzodiazpine receptors. In preparations under spontaneous tone and in the absence of adenosine, dipyridamole (10(-5) M) and diazepam (10(-5)-10(-4) M), alpidem (3 x 10(-6) M-10(-5) M) and zopiclone (10(-6)-10(-4) M) induced a relaxation of the airway smooth muscle. In addition, dazepam (10(-4) M) attenuated the phasic response to histamine (10(-5) M). Dipyridamole (10(-5) M) and diazepam (10(-4) M) respectively produced a 56.2 and 32.4-fold potentiation of adenosine relaxant effects. Alpidem (10(-6)-10(-5) M), zolpidem (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and zopiclone (10(-6)-10(-4) M) were without any significant effect on the adenosine concentration-response curves. Moreover, alpidem, zolpidem, and zopiclone did not modify the 2-chloroadenosine dose-response curves nor the diazepam induced sensitization of adenosine-induced relaxation. In conclusion, adenosine sensitization of the guinea pig isolated trachea caused by diazepam might involve a peripheral benzodiazpine receptor subtype coupled to a nucleoside transporter system which is different from those recognized by compounds derived from the imidazopyridine series.", 
    "27": "Two initial studies investigated: i) the effects of withdrawal from ipsapirone [a putative non-benzodiazepine (BZ) anxiolytic] and chlordiazepoxide (CDP); and ii) effects of ipsapirone in animals withdrawn from CDP. Rats were injected b.i.d. for 21 days with saline, ipsapirone or CDP at doses up to 40 mg/kg/injection. Subsequently, controls received the treatment administered previously, other subjects received saline during withdrawal from ipsapirone or CDP. Further subjects received ipsapirone (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg b.i.d.) during CDP withdrawal. Withdrawal indices recorded were body weight and food intake. Withdrawal signs were absent after ipsapirone treatment but present after CDP treatment, when food intake and bodyweight measures fell and then recovered. At the high dose of 30 mg/kg (b.i.d.) ipsapirone potentiated CDP withdrawal signs. Potentiation of withdrawal was not seen in animals treated with ipsapirone at lower doses (3 and 10 mg/kg, b.i.d.). In a subsequent study we found that ipsapirone conditioned a taste aversion, a possible index of drug-induced \"malaise\", at doses as low as 7.5 mg/kg. Therefore a possible explanation for the potentiation of BZ withdrawal in subjects treated with high doses of ipsapirone was that drug-induced \"malaise\" reduced food intake and body weight, rather than ipsapirone causing true potentiation of BZ withdrawal. However, in a further study we showed that the ipsapirone treatment regime which potentiated BZ withdrawal did not significantly reduce food intake or body weight, suggesting that high doses of ipsapirone potentiate BZ withdrawal by a mechanism that does not simply involve \"malaise\".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Flumazenil reversed midazolam-induced sedation on the subjective, psychophysiological and motor indices used. In contrast, there was little evidence of any reversal of amnesic effects, which were assessed using both direct (explicit) and indirect (implicit) measures of memory. Results are discussed in terms of dissociating the sedative and amnesic effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "29": "In order to investigate whether protein malnutrition in early life causes lasting changes in reactivity to anxiolytic drugs, exploration of the elevated plus-maze was used. Rat dams during lactation (21 days) and pups after weaning until day 49 of life were fed on 8% casein diet (M rats), while their well-nourished controls received 25% casein (W rats). From day 50 on all animals ate the same balanced diet. Experiments started on day 70. Under the non-drug condition, M rats tended to explore the open arms of the maze relatively more than W rats. Diazepam (0.5-5 mg/kg, IP) dose-dependently increased the percentage of open/total arm entries without significantly affecting the total number of arm entries in W rats. This selective anxiolytic effect of diazepam was considerably smaller in M rats. Ipsapirone (0.5-5 mg/kg) caused a similar though less pronounced anxiolytic effect in W rats, whereas the drug decreased both the % open/total and total arm entries in M rats. In contrast, ritanserin (0.05-1 mg/kg) significantly increased the % open/total arm entries in M rats only, though not in a dose-dependent way. Isamoltane (2.5-20 mg/kg) was ineffective on both M and W rats. These results indicate that early protein malnutrition causes long-lasting alterations in brain systems regulating emotional behaviour.", 
    "30": "The role of the amygdala in the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines was examined. Performance on a water-licking conflict paradigm was tested in rats with localized damage to the central nucleus of the amygdala (ACE) or with general damage to the entire amygdaloid complex. The effects of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (2.5-20.0 mg/kg) on conflict behavior in these animals was also examined. Electrolytic lesions of either ACE or of the entire amygdaloid complex resulted in a pronounced increase of punished responding, an effect that persisted for at least 12 sessions postoperatively. After shock levels were adjusted in the lesioned groups to match their baseline punished behavior to that of the controls, various doses of chlordiazepoxide were administered. Not only did the lesioned animals show an increase in punished behavior in response to the drug, they were more sensitive than controls to the lower drug doses. A complete model of anxiolytic action may have to include both mechanisms that block anxiogenic regions and those that activate anxiolytic regions.", 
    "31": "In naive mice the selective D2 agonist LY171555 dose-dependently (0.5-5 mg/kg) induces defensive responses toward non-aggressive conspecifics. In order to investigate possible anxiogenic properties of the D2 agonist, its behavioural effects were compared with those produced by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate(beta-CCM) in the elevated plus maze and in social interactions with non-aggressive opponents. When tested in the elevated plus maze, mice injected with LY 171555 (0.005-1 mg/kg) showed no decrease either of the number of entries or of the time spent in the open arms. At 5 mg/kg an actual increase of these two measures was observed. By contrast, beta-CCM (1-3 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased both the number of entries and the time spent in the open arms without altering locomotion. The effects of beta-CCM were antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788 (3 mg/kg) showing a selective involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in their modulation. On the other hand, beta-CCM, (1-3 mg/kg) did not produce significant effects on defensive behaviour of mice interacting with non-aggressive opponents and the defensive responses of mice treated with 1 mg/kg LY 171555 were not prevented by 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide. These results show that DA D2-mediated hyperdefensiveness and anxiety modulated by benzodiazepine receptors are unrelated phenomena and suggest that this behavioural response may represent a model of those forms of fear-related reaction that do not respond to benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "32": "The effects of drugs interacting with the GABAA/benzodiazepine chloride ionophore receptor complex (GABAA/BDZ-RC) on the anticonflict and biochemical effects observed after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; 450 micrograms -14 days) were investigated in the rat using a modified Vogel's drinking conflict test. The GABAergic antagonistic drugs bicuculline, picrotoxin and Ro 15-4513 all counteracted the 5,7-DHT induced anxiolytic-like action in doses that did not alter the behavior per se, whereas flumazenil was ineffective in this respect. Also i.c.v. administration of 5-HT antagonized the 5,7-DHT induced anticonflict effect. Furthermore, 5,7-DHT-lesioned animals appeared more sensitive to the anticonflict effects of diazepam than sham-lesioned controls. The 5,7-DHT treatment produced marked depletions of 5-HT in the limbic system (80-90%) and hippocampus (90-95%), and an increase in the 5-HIAA/5-HT quotient in hippocampus. The effects on the levels of noradrenaline were comparatively small. The doses of bicuculline and picrotoxin antagonizing the 5,7-DHT induced anticonflict effect did not uniformly influence 5-HT levels or 5-HIAA/5-HT quotients. It is suggested that the anxiolytic-like effect observed in 5,7-DHT-lesioned rats in Vogel's drinking conflict test involves enhanced transmission at the GABAA/BDZ-RC.", 
    "33": "A case is reported of a patient who suffered from ischaemic enteritis after having taken an overdose of several drugs. The 42-year-old woman was found out no more than 7 h after she had taken a mixture of benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants and barbiturates (4 mg.l-1 blood level on admission). She had been lying against a bedpost, resulting in compression of her anterior abdominal wall below the umbilicus, involving her right femoral nerve. There was a severe rhabdomyolysis. Despite clinical improvement, the patient being extubated the following day, her abdomen remained painful and swollen. A CT abdominal scan showed a peritoneal effusion and a distended small bowel. Laparatomy revealed severe ischaemia of the terminal 80 cm of ileum, with some gangrenous areas. This was resected, and a right-sided ileostomy performed. Histopathological examination demonstrated a mucosal necrosis without mesenteric arterial thrombosis. A bilateral pleural effusion occurred during postoperative course, requiring drainage. Thereafter, the clinical course was uneventful, with intestinal continuity being re-established three months later. The femoral paralysis receded spontaneously. It is likely that this unusual postural complication of coma may be attributed to a transient compression of mesenteric vessels.", 
    "34": "A case is reported of a 50-year-old man who took a massive overdose of diltiazem (5,400 mg), together with 1,350 mg potassium clorazepate and 390 mg nordazepate, five months after having experienced a myocardial infarction (MI). On admission, systolic blood pressure was 80 mmHg, with an irregular heart rate of 60 b.min-1. There was superficial polypnea (40 c.min-1) with hypoxia (PaO2: 63.5 mmHg). The ECG revealed, besides the MI scar, complete sinus arrest. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were rapidly required. The patient then had gastric lavage, and was given activated charcoal. Treatment with 1.5 mg atropine and 2 g intravenous calcium chloride were unable to amend the cardiac dysrhythmia. A continuous isoproterenol infusion restored a sinus rhythm, but this was not maintained because of the risk of side-effects. Cardiovascular collapse was treated with dobutamine (10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). As the peripheral and pulmonary vascular resistances were greatly diminished (464 dyn.s.cm-5 and 86 dyn.s.cm-5 respectively), alpha and beta mimetics were used: 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 noradrenaline and 15 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 dobutamine. After 7 h of this treatment, spontaneous sinus rhythm returned abruptly. Noradrenaline and dobutamine were replaced thereafter with adrenaline (0.25 microgram.kg-1.min-1), which was stopped 24 h later. There was a marked respiratory and haemodynamic improvement, the patient leaving the intensive care unit on the fourth day and returning home one week after the overdose. The relationships between cellular calcium movements and the adrenergic system are discussed, as well as the possible mechanism of cardiac failure.", 
    "35": "A new method involving the blockade of operant behaviour induced by the withdrawal of a conditioned signal for safety without presentation of a punishment signal has been developed for studying drugs with anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties. For this purpose, rats were trained under two alternating components of a multiple schedule of reinforcement FR8 (food)/FR1 (food) + RR 50% (shocks randomly delivered with 50 +/- 15% of the presses). The nonpunished and punished periods were signalled by one cue light above the right lever (safety signal) or the left lever (punishment signal), respectively. On the test session (safety signal withdrawal), the safety signal was turned off at the end of the first nonpunished period, but the punishment signal was not presented (every press was food rewarded and no shocks were delivered). During this period (4 min), rats exhibited a strong blockade of responding that lessened over time. This suppression seemed not to be caused by intervening events such as novelty, temporal conditioning, schedule of food delivery or ambiguity of the signal presented. The behavioural blockade induced by withdrawal of the safety signal was reduced by benzodiazepines: diazepam (0.5-4 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (4-8 mg/kg), nitrazepam (0.25-2 mg/kg), alprazolam (0.25-1 mg/kg), and partial agonists at benzodiazepine receptors: bretazenil (0.125-8 mg/kg) and ZK 91296 (32-64 mg/kg). Various 5-HT-related drugs also lessened the behavioural blockade:pCPA (3 x 150 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, buspirone (0.25-2 mg/kg), gepirone (0.25-1 mg/kg) but not 8-OH-DPAT. Compounds that may cause anxiety in humans further enhanced the blockade of lever pressing induced by the safety signal withdrawal at doses that did not modify baseline responding: d-amphetamine (0.125-0.5 mg/kg), caffeine (16 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (1 mg/kg). FG 7142 (8 mg/kg) and CGS 8216 (2-8 mg/kg) decreased responding during both components of the session. Therefore, the present paradigm seems sensitive to both \"anxiolytic\" and \"anxiogenic\" effects of drugs under identical procedural conditions.", 
    "36": "In order to characterize the pharmacologic profile of DN-2327, an isoindoline benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor ligand, its interactions with Ro15-1788 and diazepam were analyzed in rodents. The anti-conflict action of DN-2327 in two conflict tests using rats, the punished water-lick conflict (Vogel conflict) and the punished bar-pressing conflict test, was completely attenuated by treatment with Ro15-1788. The anti-convulsive (pentylenetetrazol [PTZ] induced convulsion) effect of DN-2327 was also reduced by Ro15-1788. These results suggest that the anti-conflict and anti-convulsive actions of DN-2327 may be mediated via BZD receptors. On the other hand, DN-2327 only slightly affected the motor coordination in mice and rats, as estimated by the inclined screen test and the climbing test, respectively; however, the compound attenuated the motor incoordination produced by diazepam. Furthermore, the pentobarbital potentiating effect of diazepam was reduced by pretreatment with DN-2327 in mice. In the Vogel conflict test, additive effects were observed upon the conflict test, additive effects were observed upon the concomitant administration of subeffective doses (5 mg/kg, PO) of DN-2327 and diazepam. DN-2327 at 20 mg/kg, PO, did not reduce but slightly potentiated the anti-conflict effect of the maximum effective dose of diazepam. For PTZ-induced convulsions, DN-2327, 0.5 and 20 mg/kg, PO, doses which produced partial and complete anti-convulsive effects, respectively, in rats did not reduce but increased additively the effects of diazepam. DN-2327 at 10 and 20 mg/kg, PO, doses which both produced partial anti-convulsive effects in mice, showed an additive effect with the partial effects of diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "38": "Ro 5-4864, diazepam, clonazepam and PK 11195 inhibit the responses of rat was deferens following electrical stimulation in the rank order Ro 5-4864 greater than PK 11195 = diazepam greater than clonazepam. The adenosine-inhibited electrically-induced response was potentiated by Ro 5-4864 or diazepam, but not by clonazepam or PK 11195. This potentiation is due to an inhibition of the adenosine uptake system.", 
    "39": "Management of benzodiazepine (BZD) tolerance is divided into low- and high-dose withdrawal. Low-dose withdrawal includes patients who have received manufacturer-recommended doses of BZD on a daily basis for longer than 1 month. Gradual tapering of the BZD over 4 weeks on an outpatient basis is suggested. High-dose withdrawal includes patients who have been ingesting doses of BZD greater than the equivalent of diazepam 40 mg/d for longer than 8 months. It is recommended that the patients be tolerance tested with diazepam and, if tolerant, tapered off medication as inpatients at a rate of 10% per day. Triazolobenzodiazepines may be exceptions to these recommendations. Alprazolam should be titrated at a rate of 0.5 mg three times a day regardless of whether the patient is being tapered for low- or high-dose withdrawal.", 
    "40": "Considerable confusion continues to surround basic concepts for abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence. Clinicians may be making decisions about prescribing these medications without clear definitions and distinctions. The terms are not equivalent in meaning and should not be used interchangeably in clinical application. Moreover, they may occur together or independently and are not etiologically related. Abuse is improper use outside the standard norms. Abuse implies a violation component and a control over the use of the drug. Addiction is a preoccupation with the acquisition and compulsive use of and a pattern of relapse to drugs is spite of adverse consequences. Pervasive to the criteria is a loss of control over drug use and a lack of volitional component in the drug use. In spite of problems in definitions, studies have clearly shown that abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence develop commonly in benzodiazepine use.", 
    "41": "The benzodiazepines were developed in the 1950s, some introduced in the 1960s, and many more since then. Pharmacologically, they are sedative/hypnotics akin to alcohol, chloral, the barbiturates, and meprobamate. All have been widely used both within and outside the licit medical context. Usage of benzodiazepines increased dramatically during the 1960s and early 1970s; tranquilizer but not hypnotic usage has since declined. Both abuse and misuse were documented early, but the incidence was deemed low in view of the widespread prescription. Normal-dose physical dependence was first suspected in the early 1970s but it was not until the early 1980s that scientific evidence was adduced to establish its reality and frequency. Further studies have revealed the complex nature of the withdrawal syndrome. A reaction has set in against these drugs, with attempts to limit them to short-term use.", 
    "42": "This article reviews the literature describing the extent of benzodiazepine use and abuse in the elderly and specific problems attendant upon this use, Unrecognized, undocumented use and abuse of psychoactive drugs is frequent in this population and can lead to serious problems with untreated dependence and withdrawal. The elderly appear to be more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines, both because of changed pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with aging and because of altered postreceptor cerebral response. All problems identified with benzodiazepines such as dependence, withdrawal, and cognitive and psychomotor impairment are proportionally greater among the elderly, who can least afford these risks. Review of the literature leads to the conclusion that benzodiazepine prescribing for the elderly should be undertaken with the greatest caution and only with the recognition of all potentially disastrous effects.", 
    "43": "Benzodiazepine use is prevalent. Moreover, benzodiazepine abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence occur commonly with benzodiazepine use. Confusion arises in assessing the nature and magnitude of benzodiazepine use and its consequences. Abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence occur in medical and nonmedical populations, but the studies do not clearly differentiate the benzodiazepine use between these two populations. The nonmedical use in medical populations is underestimated and underdiagnosed. The nonmedical use is also misdiagnosed in nonmedical populations as medical use. Clearer definitions and usage of the terms of abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence would result in accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of the disorders associated with benzodiazepine use, that is, anxiety and depressive disorders, alcoholism, and other drug addictions.", 
    "44": "Benzodiazepines, which are among the safest and most effective drugs, possess all the characteristic of abuseable compounds. Although there appear to be differences in potency among compounds and variations in sensitivity among individuals, benzodiazepines have clear reinforcing properties. Tolerance to the depressant effects of benzodiazepines is rapid, but tolerance to the anxiolytic effects develops slowly and to a limited extent. Although abusers use very high doses, most long-term users persist at daily doses in the low therapeutic range (10-20 mg of diazepam or its equivalent) without dose escalation. Physical dependence is a risk associated with long-term use, even at therapeutic doses. The withdrawal syndrome is mild at low doses. Continued self-administration of low therapeutic doses is maintained to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The advances in the recent understanding of the molecular biology of the benzodiazepine receptor gives hope to the development of new anxiolytic compounds with less dependence liability than the present ones.", 
    "45": "The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome is a complex phenomenon which presents serious difficulties in definition and measurement. It is particularly difficult to set out precise limits on its duration. Many withdrawal symptoms are a result of pharmacodynamic tolerance to benzodiazepines, some mechanisms for which are discussed. Such tolerance develops unevenly in different brain systems and may be slow to reverse. Withdrawal symptoms occurring in the first week after cessation of drug use tend to merge with more persistent symptoms that may last for many months. These prolonged symptoms do not necessarily constitute \"true\" pharmacological withdrawal symptoms, but are nevertheless related to long-term benzodiazepine use. Such symptoms can include anxiety, which may partly result from a learning deficit imposed by the drugs, and a variety of sensory and motor neurological symptoms. The protracted nature of some of these symptoms raises the possibility that benzodiazepines can give rise not only to slowly reversible functional changes in the central nervous system, but may also occasionally cause structural neuronal damage.",

The present experiment examined, using a battery of tests, the effects of in utero exposure to the benzodiazepine inverse agonists DMCM and FG 7142 upon the early development and adult behaviour of Swiss Mice. 2.

Effects on adult social behaviour examined using the resident-intruder paradigm by determining the time spent in broad behavioural categories, showed marginal effects due to chlordiazepoxide and more striking actions due to midazolam treatments.

Fibrogastroscopy is a method of early diagnosis of duodenal ulcer in women. As compared to men, the size and depth of ulcers in women was less. Acid and peptic factor was also less pronounced. The four-week treatment with the use of the diet, antacids, gastrozepine and repair agents brought about ulcer healing in 82% of the women. The single and daily doses of antacids administered to women were 1.5 times less than in men. The use of H2-blockers is indicated in women with a severe course of peptic ulcer. The inclusion of antibacterial agents is indicated if the mucous membrane of the antral part of the stomach demonstrates Campylobacter pylori.",

After administration of flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepines antagonist, respiratory depression was corrected. HPLC with UV detection methods after selective extraction were developed to measure simultaneously prothipendyl and zolpidem without flumazenil interaction. These methods could be applied in drug monitoring and in emergency toxicology.", 
    "50": "In an earlier report from this laboratory, it was demonstrated that the central cholinergic system exerted a modulatory pro-inflammatory effect on carrageenin-induced paw inflammation in rats. In this study, the role of the central muscarinic receptors in cholinergic modulation of peripheral inflammation was investigated by using several M1 and M2 receptor agonists and antagonists. The M1 receptor agonists aceclidine and arecholine and the nonspecific muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine augmented carrageenin oedema, an effect attenuated by the M1 receptor antagonist scopolamine. Physostigmine behaved like a M1 receptor agonist at all dose levels. However, the other M2 receptor agonist, carbachol, produced a dose-dependent dual effect, with lower doses attenuating the oedema and higher doses augmenting the inflammation. While the former action appeared to be due to M2 receptor stimulation, because it was blocked by AF-DX 116--a M2 receptor antagonist, the latter action appeared to be induced by M1 receptor stimulation, because it was inhibited by scopolamine. The pro-inflammatory effect of the M2 receptor antagonists AF-DX 116 and gallamine appeared to be induced by enhanced neuronal release of acetylcholine, because the effects were not evident following pretreatment with hemicholinium, which attenuates synthesis of the amine. Muscarinic receptor binding studies with (3H)-QNB indicated that the corpus striatum has substantially higher population of M1 receptors compared with the cerebellum. In the corpus striatum, (3H)-QNB binding indicated initial up-regulation followed by down-regulation of M1 receptors during peak inflammation, which appeared to persist even after a decrease in the inflammation. In contrast, the M1 receptors in the cerebellum appeared to be down-regulated very transiently during the early phase of the inflammation. While these receptor alterations may be due to the inflammation, it is equally possible that they represent changes induced by the stress of pain and inflammation induced by carrageenin.", 
    "51": "Many drugs have been found to increase or decrease the clearance of theophylline, probably by interaction with one or more of the variants of the cytochrome P450 drug-metabolising system. Theophylline may be particularly susceptible to alteration of its clearance because of the particular form(s) of the P450 system involved, because its metabolism is saturable, and/or because 90% of its elimination is via metabolism. Its clearance has been found to be decreased (typically by around 25%, but often by far more) by erythromycin, troleandomycin (triacetyloleandomycin), roxithromycin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fluoroquinolone T-3262, pipemidic acid, cimetidine, etintidine, propranolol, verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, furosemide (frusemide), at least some anovulent agents, viloxazine, allopurinol, ticlopidine, idrocilamide, thiabendazole, disulfiram, influenza- and BCG-vaccination, interferon, and caffeine (half-life increase). In contrast, theophylline clearance (clearance/bioavailability) was found to be increased by isoprenaline (isoproterenol), terbutaline, some corticosteroids, phenytoin, phenobarbital, activated charcoal, felodipine moricizine, benzodiazepines and sulfinpyrazone - typically by about 25%, but sometimes by as much as 80% or more. For several of these concomitant medications, however, only some of the published studies can substantiate an influence, which may highlight the sensitivity of some interactions to particular experimental and/or clinical conditions, e.g. with terbutaline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, phenobarbital, cimetidine, verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, anovulents, allopurinol and influenza vaccination. Moreover, reports both of inhibition and of induction of theophylline clearance by each of rifampicin and isoniazid have appeared. Nevertheless, under investigation many medications have not been found to perceptibly influence theophylline disposition kinetics, e.g. ephedrine, orciprenaline (metaproterenol), prednisone, prednisolone, temelastine, terfenadine, mequitazine, picumast, repirinast, josamycin, midecamycin, miocamycin, spiramycin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefalexin, cefaclor, ceftibuten, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole), tetracycline, doxycycline, lomefloxacin, fluoroquinolones NY-198 and AM-833, nalidixic acid, lincomycin, metronidazole, certain antacids, ranitidine, roxatidine, pirenzepine, rioprostil, metoclopramide, metoprolol, atenolol, nadolol, medroxyprogesterone, dextropropoxyphene (propoxyphene), piroxicam, ozagrel, mebendazole and ascorbic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "52": "A sample of 171 benzodiazepine (bzd) users was investigated in the pharmacy where the patients filled in their prescriptions. Of the sample, 29.8% were males and 70.2% were females. About 60% of the patients had their current prescription from a general practitioner, the rest from different specialists. 70.8% stated to take bzds on more than 3 days of the week. The mean duration of intake of the entire sample was 4.5 years. The most frequent reasons for bzd intake were sleep disturbance followed by nervousness and somatic diseases. A total of 74.9% of the patients turned out to be well informed about the potential dependence hazards of bzd long term intake, but less than half of them had been informed by the prescribing physician. In a second step it could be demonstrated by means of multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis that certain characteristic parameters differentiate long-term users and persons with signs of potential abuse and dependence from other bzd users.", 
    "53": "Self-injection of 12 sedative-anxiolytics was examined in baboons. Intravenous injections and initiation of a 3-h time-out were dependent upon completion of a fixed-ratio schedule requirement, permitting eight injections per day. Before testing each dose of drug, self-injection performance was established with cocaine. Subsequently, a test dose was substituted for cocaine. At some doses, all five of the benzodiazepines examined (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, triazolam) maintained rates (number of injections per day) of drug self-injection above vehicle control in each of the baboons tested. Maximum rates of benzodiazepine self-injection were generally submaximal. Of the benzodiazepines examined, triazolam maintained the highest rates of self-injection. Among the three barbiturates tested, methohexital generally maintained high rates of self-injection in contrast to hexobarbital and phenobarbital, which only maintained low rates. Of the four non-benzodiazepine non-barbiturate sedatives examined, both chloral hydrate and methyprylon occasionally maintained high rates of self-injection. Although there were differences within and across animals, baclofen maintained intermediate rates of self-injection. The novel anxiolytic buspirone maintained only low rates of self-injection that were not different from vehicle. This study further validates the self-injection methodology for assessing sedative-anxiolytic abuse liability and provides new information about drug elimination rate as a determinant of drug self-administration.",

    "55": "In vivo benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by increasing doses of CL 218,872 has been evaluated in the baboon Papio papio, using (11C) RO 15-1788 as specific radioligand and positron emission tomography as external detection system. Although BZR heterogeneity has been previously demonstrated in the brain of the living baboon using PET, we did not observe in our studies that CL 218,872 interacts preferentially with one of the BZR subtypes. The monophasic pattern of the dose dependent CL 218,872 displacement curve and the corresponding \"in vivo Hill coefficient\" near unity suggest that CL 218,872 binds in cerebral baboon cortex with a similar affinity with BZ1 as well as BZ2 subtypes. The anticonvulsant properties of CL 218,872 against bicuculline and allylglycine-induced seizures were correlated with benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by assessment of electroencephalographic activity during positron emission tomography studies. Our data confirmed in vivo the hypothesis of a partial agonist anticonvulsant activity of CL 218,872. At the same time, the use of a GABA-antagonist (bicuculline) or an inhibitor of the GABA synthesis (allylglycine) suggested the existence of an allosteric interaction between benzodiazepine receptors and GABA receptors.", 
    "56": "Distribution kinetics of flurazepam, medazepam, prazepam, and clobazam were determined in rats. Concentration-time curves of unchanged drugs and non-polar metabolites in plasma, adipose tissue, liver, brain, and muscle after a single iv administration were obtained using GLC/electron capture detector analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for plasma and tissues. Adipose tissue storage was quantified with the adipose storage index (ASI). Including data of benzodiazepines from the literature, a correlation between ASI and log P (over a range 1.6-3.8) was nonexistent and the influence of individual functional groups was not easily discernible. However, benzodiazepines with a pKa (base) within the range 1.6-6.2 were stored in adipose tissue (ASI greater than 1), whereas those with pKa greater than 7 were not (ASI less than 1). Since many other basic lipophilic drugs with pKa greater than 7 are not stored in adipose tissue, and this is likely due to lysosomal trapping in lean tissues, which requires a pKa value above 7, it is suggested that within the series of benzodiazepines, adipose tissue storage is mainly influenced by the basicity of the drugs.", 
    "57": "Stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH), which is seen in the last mice removed from the cage, is a novel animal model sensitive to anxiolytic drugs. SIH is antagonized by CL 218872 (25 and 50 mg/kg, os), by tracazolate (5 and 7.5 mg/kg, ip) and by 2-AP-5 (50 and 100 mg/kg, ip). At higher dose, CL 218872 (100 mg/kg, os) and tracazolate (12.5 mg/kg, ip) lose their activity. PK 9084 (5-40 mg/kg, ip) and CGS 9896 (2-20 mg/kg, both ip and os) were also ineffective in preventing SIH. The anti-hyperthermic effect of CL 218872 (25 mg/kg) and tracazolate (7.5 mg/kg) was blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (15 mg/kg), CGS 9896 (10 mg/kg, os) also reversed the effect of CL 218872 (25 mg/kg) on SIH. Differently from anxiolytics, MK-801 (0.5-1 mg/kg, os), PCP (2.5 mg/kg, ip) and d-amphetamine (10 mg/kg, ip) evoked hyperthermia in the first set of mice and prevented a further stress-induced rise of body temperature in the last set of mice.", 
    "58": "This article will review the literature on the use of a BZ in schizophrenic nonresponders, other acutely psychotic patients, acute mania and catatonia.", 
    "59": "Each animal was chronically implanted with bipolar electrodes in dorsal central gray matter (DCG) and was trained to press a lever to decrease the DCG-stimulation current. Chlordiazepoxide (5-20 mg/kg, PO), diazepam (2-10 mg/kg, PO) and bromazepam (1-5 mg/kg, PO) produced dose-dependent increases in the DCG-stimulation threshold 1-4 h after administration without affecting motor performance. Meprobamate (200 mg/kg, PO) and pentobarbital (10 mg/kg, PO) also slightly increased the stimulation threshold. Their potency was in the order of bromazepam greater than diazepam greater than chlordiazepoxide greater than pentobarbital greater than meprobamate. The increase in the threshold induced by diazepam (10 mg/kg, PO) was inhibited by the GABA antagonists, bicuculline (1 mg/kg, IP) and picrotoxin (0.1 mg/kg, IP). These results suggest that decreased susceptibility to brain stimulation is involved in suppressing effects of anxiolytic drugs on the escape behavior, and also that the antiaversive action of benzodiazepines may be related to a GABAergic mechanism.", 
    "60": "These studies characterise the pharmacology of ropinirole, a selective D-2 agonist. High-affinity human caudate binding revealed a Ki for D2 receptors of 2.9 x 10(-8) M with no affinity for D1 at 10(-4) M in the rat. Ropinirole was weakly active at alpha 2-adrenoceptors and 5-HT2 receptors but inactive at 5-HT1, benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors or alpha 1 and beta-adrenoceptors. In rodents, ropinirole, like apomorphine, caused biphasic spontaneous locomotor activity and contralateral circling in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice with no tolerance to the latter after 14 days treatment. Amphetamine caused ipsilateral responses in the lesioned mice. Ropinirole did not cause marked stereotypies. In marmosets ropinirole (0.05-1.0 mg/kg SC or 0.1 mg/kg PO) reversed all motor and behavioural deficits induced by MPTP. This response started 10-20 minutes after dosing, and exceeded 2 hours. No tolerance was seen following chronic b.i.d. treatment. Similar results were obtained with 1-dopa plus benserazide; however, 1-dopa always caused emesis, whereas beneficial effects were shown with ropinirole in the absence of this side effect. These results support the continued clinical assessment of ropinirole for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.", 
    "61": "Several lines of evidence have established that performance during the initial steps of acquisition on a shuttle-box avoidance task is an anxiety-mediated behavior (i.e., the differences between strains selectivity bred for emotionality; the effects of postnatal handling; the course of the corticosterone response and behavioral measures of fear during acquisition). The present study was carried out to add pharmacological evidence to that view by testing the action of anxiogenic and anxiolytic drugs. Single 40-trial sessions with mild shocks (0.4 mA-0.6 mA) were used. In the first experiments the action of sodium pentobarbital (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg) and three benzodiazepines (diazepam, 2 and 4 mg/kg; alprazolam, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 mg/kg and adinazolam, 1, 2, 4 and 6 mg/kg) were tested. The last two experiments tested a possible proanxiety action of Ro 15-4513 (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg) and FG 7142 (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg), two partial inverse agonists of benzodiazepine receptors, which previous data had suggested to be anxiogenic. The results showed that the measure of acquisition of a two-way active avoidance is a sensitive mean for detecting either anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects of drugs, independently of their effects on locomotor activity, thus suggesting that such test could be a valid model of anxiety in animals.", 
    "62": "In 1989 more than 36.4 million new prescriptions for minor tranquilizers (MTs) were written in the continental United States. These drugs were 81 percent of all tranquilizers prescribed; the majority of the MTs were benzodiazepines, with hydroxyzines, meprobamates and buspirones making up the remaining 19 percent. The predominant diagnosis associated with the total MT group of drugs was \"anxiety states\". This condition was listed as a reason for one in every four new prescriptions for MTs. Per capita new prescriptions averaged 232.3 per 1,000 population, with the highest rate reported in the East South Central area and the lowest in the Pacific states. Psychiatrists accounted for 20 percent of the new prescriptions, just behind internists with 21 percent.", 
    "63": "The effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands on different types of defensive behaviours were examined in intruder male rats confronted with offensive residents. Chronic administration, via a subcutaneous silastic pellet, of a full agonist (diazepam) for 15 days increased self-defensive postures as well as social and non-social behaviour whereas submissive postures and flight were reduced. Acute administration of a partial agonist (ZK 91296) resulted in a similar increase in self-defensive postures and a decrease of submission and non-social elements. Acute administration of a partial inverse agonist (FG 7142) reduced defensive postures and social behaviour whereas submissive postures were increased. These results show that activation of benzodiazepine receptors by full or partial agonists increased self-defensive responses to attacks by a conspecific, while decreasing submissive postures. On the contrary, \"inverse activation\" of these receptors by an inverse agonist increased submissive postures while decreasing self-defensive responses. These data suggest that benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the control of the animal's strategy to respond to an attack of another rat.", 
    "64": "Blockade of glutamatergic transmission in the striatum (using the NMDA-antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid AP-5) was recently shown to induce stereotyped sniffing in rats. Comparable stereotyped behaviour is well known to be elicited by stimulation of dopamine activity, which since long was the basis for experimental models to check for possible antipsychotic activity of new compounds. However, whereas dopamine-induced stereotypies are antagonized only by classical neuroleptics, stereotypies induced by blockade of glutamatergic transmission are antagonized by classical as well as by atypical antipsychotics. Umespirone, a novel psychotropic which has been reported to exhibit behavioural effects predictive for antipsychotic as well as anxiolytic potential was evaluated for antagonistic effects against AP-5-induced behaviour. The profile of umespirone was compared with the profile of a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic buspirone as well as with previously published data of neuroleptics. Umespirone like clozapine specifically antagonized AP-5-induced sniffing, i.e. did not impair spontaneous sniffing but reversed AP-5-induced excessive sniffing. In contrast, buspirone impaired spontaneous and AP-5-induced sniffing to about the same extend. These results are in accordance with the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and again give evidence that umespirone should have antipsychotic potential and a very low liability to exhibit unspecific sedative action.", 
    "65": "In this minireview an overview description of the different pharmacophores that have been proposed for the benzodiazepine receptor is presented. The methodology as well as the experimental information used in the development of each model will be described. Finally, the new experimental discoveries that are likely to affect the models presented are briefly indicated.", 
    "66": "Previous studies have demonstrated that bupivacaine administered directly into the central nervous system (CNS) is capable of producing signs of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity. To investigate the mechanisms by which bupivacaine may act within the CNS to produce cardiovascular toxicity, we studied four groups of halothane-anesthetized rabbits in which infusion of intracerebroventricular (icv) bupivacaine or intravenous (iv) phenylephrine resulted in dysrhythmias and hypertension. In group 1 (n = 5), icv bupivacaine (500 +/- 79 micrograms [mean +/- SEM]) produced dysrhythmias lasting 73 +/- 13 min, whereas icv saline caused no dysrhythmias or hypertension. In group 2 (n = 9), icv bupivacaine-induced hypertension and dysrhythmias were abolished by icv midazolam in 4.4 +/- 0.6 min, and when dysrhythmias and hypertension recurred (22 +/- 0.9 min), hexamethonium (10 mg/kg iv) promptly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension (14 +/- 1 s). In group 3 (n = 10), icv bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by increasing the inspired halothane concentration from 0.8 to 1.6%. In group 4 (n = 6), iv phenylephrine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by icv midazolam. These results suggest that icv bupivacaine produces dysrhythmias and hypertension by increasing autonomic nervous system (ANS) outflow from the brain stem. The finding that peripheral autonomic blockade by hexamethonium rapidly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension supports this mechanism. We speculate that icv bupivacaine produces an increase in autonomic outflow by blockade of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that are known to be the principal tonic inhibitors of the ANS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Neuropsychological deficits including dementia in some alcoholics may potentially result from progressive, submicroscopic loss of synaptic receptors in the absence of morphological lesions. The densities of two types of synaptic receptors were determined in autopsy brain homogenates from several brain regions of not grossly demented alcoholics and non-alcoholic controls. In alcoholics, muscarinic cholinergic receptors were decreased by 40% in frontal cortex, temporal cortex and putamen and by 30% in hippocampus. Benzodiazepine receptors were decreased by 30% in hippocampus and by 25% in frontal cortex but not in temporal cortex or putamen. These changes occurred in histologically normal brains in the absence of Wernicke's encephalopathy, coma, liver cirrhosis and cholinergic or benzodiazepine medications. A computer data base matched for differences in death-autopsy time intervals, age and hypoxia. We conclude that chronic exposure to alcohol results in a loss of synaptic receptors with their synapses. To what extent such receptor losses could result in impairment of cognitive function is currently unknown but will depend on other factors such as the availability of spare receptors and what subtypes of receptors are involved. A rationale may emerge for using in alcoholics the cholinergic treatments currently being developed for the cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "68": "In rats, pre- but not post-training ip administration of either flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist, or of n-butyl-B-carboline-carboxylate (BCCB), an inverse agonist, enhanced retention of inhibitory avoidance learning. Flumazenil blocked the enhancing effect of BCCB, and the inhibitory effect of the BZD agonists clonazepam and diazepam also given pre-training. Post-training administration of these drugs had no effect. The peripheral BZD receptor agonist/chloride channel blocker Ro5-4864 had no effect on the inhibitory avoidance task when given ip prior to training, but it caused enhancement when given immediately post-training either ip or icv. This effect was blocked by PK11195, a competitive antagonist of Ro5-4864. These results suggest that there is an endogenous mechanism mediated by BZD agonists, which is sensitive to inverse agonists and that normally down-regulates the formation of memories through a mechanism involving GABA-A receptors and the corresponding chloride channels. The most likely agonists for the endogenous mechanism suggested are the diazepam-like BZDs found in brain whose origin is possibly alimentary. Levels of these BZDs in the cortex were found to sharply decrease after inhibitory avoidance training or mere exposure to the training apparatus.", 
    "69": "Adult rats were submitted to two different behavioral tasks using the same apparatus: the habituation of exploration of the apparatus considered as a novel environment as measured by the decrease in number of rearings and of ambulation between training and testing, and step-down inhibitory avoidance as measured by the increase in the latency to step down from a start platform onto an electrified grid between the training and the test session. The training-test interval for both tasks was 20 h. The immediate post-training injection of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 nmol) bilaterally into the hippocampus enhanced retention of the two tasks. Application of the same drug, at the same dose to the septum or amygdala had no effect on habituation but enhanced retention of the avoidance task. The data are consistent with previous findings showing that both tasks are accompanied by the release of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity in the three structures and that this release is greater after the avoidance task. The present findings suggest a differential regional involvement of endogenous benzodiazepine-mediated mechanisms in memory modulation, according to the task undertaken.", 
    "70": "1. The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (membrane fraction P2) was studied after 13-day oral treatment of male Wistar rats with the Ca(2+)-antagonists nifedipine (20 mg/kg), verapamil (50 mg/kg), flunarizine (10 mg/kg) and with the calmodulin (CaM)-antagonist trifluoperazine (TFP) (3 mg/kg). 2. The changes in the binding characteristics of the benzodiazepine receptors in the frontal cortex were studied in vitro after the addition of nifedipine (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) and verapamil (10(-6) and 10(-5) M). 3. A significant decrease of the binding capacity (Bmax) of [3H]flunitrazepam was established after in vivo treatment with the three Ca(2+)-antagonists as well as after TFP, the decrease being much more pronounced in the hippocampus. 4. Changes in the affinity values (Kd) of [3H]flunitrazepam binding were found in neither of the groups. 5. No data for a direct interaction of nifedipine and verapamil with the brain benzodiazepine receptors were obtained in in vitro experiments.", 
    "71": "A paradigm for assessing benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity was developed using intravenous midazolam in normal volunteers. After administration of incremental doses of midazolam, alterations in saccadic eye movement parameters and psychological self ratings were assessed. Significant changes included dose-dependent slowing of peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, reduced saccade acceleration/deceleration ratio and saccade accuracy, and increased sedation self-ratings. Changes in saccade variables and sedation ratings were significantly correlated, and also correlated with plasma midazolam concentrations. No significant changes were seen in saccade latency or anxiety self-ratings. Pharmacological specificity of these changes was demonstrated by their reversal with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. This challenge paradigm appears to be a sensitive means of assessing benzodiazepine receptor function in man.", 
    "72": "A study was made of the effect of the single test dose of diazepam (10 mg, i. m.) and continuous drug therapy on the narrow spectral bands of the EEG in the range of 0.4-30.0 Hz. A relationship was demonstrated between the pattern of EEG changes and individual intensity in patients of the clinical manifestations of activation, tranquilization and sedation as well as the total efficacy of continuous therapy, disease standing and previous treatment. The frequencies of alpha-rhythm were found to be more informative for the reflection of the clinico-electrophysiological correlations established.", 
    "73": "Drugs most commonly used in the treatment of alcoholic withdrawal are antianxiety agents, namely benzodiazepines. Some similarities may be found between the mechanism of action of such active principles and that of alcohol at the GABAergic transmission level. In mice with physical dependence, in vivo binding of [3H]-RO 15-1788 to central benzodiazepine receptors increases during the initial period, but then tends to taper down to its basal value in the course of withdrawal. Neurochemical treatment with alpha-adrenergic drugs or with agents than can stimulate serotonergic transmission, as opposed to meprobamate therapy, promotes faster recovery of basal levels. In man, these data may be referred to decreased benzodiazepine consumption in the course of alcohol withdrawal. The results suggest that both noradrenergic and serotonergic treatments may be associated with significantly lower risks for newly induced benzodiazepine dependence.", 
    "74": "The effects of various 5-HT3 receptor antagonists were examined in the social interaction (SI) test following discrete microinjection into either the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) or amygdala of the rat. Following DRN injection, ondansetron, ICS205-930, and MDL72222 (5-500 ng) all failed to modify SI under high light/unfamiliar (HLU) test conditions relative to vehicle pretreated controls. The 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 2-Me 5-HT (100-2500 ng), was similarly ineffective under both HLU and low light/familiar (LLF) conditions, although 5-HT (20-100 ng) increased SI under the HLU paradigm. After amygdaloid injection, ondansetron (10-100 ng), granisetron (1-10 ng), ICS205-930 (10-100 ng), GR 65630 (1-10 ng), and MDL72222 (100-1000 ng) all significantly increased SI under the HLU but not LLF condition. Furthermore, a detailed behavioural analysis revealed that the behaviours underlying this increase were similar to those seen in vehicle pretreated animals tested in the LLF compared to HLU condition. The benzodiazepine, flurazepam (200 ng), increased both SI (HLU condition) and punished responding in a modified water-lick conflict model, after amygdaloid injection. Both ondansetron (10-1000 ng) and ICS205-930 (1-100 ng) were ineffective in the conflict test. Finally, 2-Me 5-HT and 5-HT (100-10,000 ng) reduced SI under the LLF test condition with no concomitant change in locomotor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Two main types of benzodiazepine receptors exist in the human brain, the central receptor type being responsible for the classical actions of the compound. Although interesting findings have been obtained in epilepsy, hepatic encephalopathy and other clinical conditions, a relevant clinical indication for the in vivo imaging of receptor binding has not yet been defined, with the possible exception of the Lennox-Gastant syndrome.", 
    "76": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine Receptors (PBR) in the kidney and Central-type Benzodiazepine Receptors (CBR) in the cerebral cortex were not affected in rats exposed to chronic hyperoxia (85% O2, ATA, 6 days). Nevertheless, cortical CBR showed a significant decrease (29%) after hyperbaric hyperoxia (100% O2, 3.5 ATA, 2 h) in rats at a preconvulsive stage, with no concomitant alteration of kidney PBR. A similar down-regulation of striatal D2 dopamine receptors was noticed (27%)--after hyperbaric hyperoxia--without any modification of cortical PBR. On the contrary, an up regulation of liver PBR was obtained in the same conditions (20%). It is likely that receptors implicated in neurotransmission are particularly down regulated or altered under hyperbaric hyperoxia.", 
    "77": "1. The present study examined the capacity of GABA to modulate flunitrazepam and Ro15-4513 binding to putative GABAA receptors. Binding was measured in distinct brain regions both before and during selected periods of withdrawal from ethanol. 2. Rats were fed a nutritionally complete liquid ethanol (4.5% w/v) diet for 4 days and at various times after the last dose of ethanol (0, 12, 24, & 72 hr), rats were sacrificed and extensively washed brain membrane fractions were prepared. 3. Competitive inhibition of 3H-flunitrazepam binding by either flunitrazepam or Ro15-4513 (10(-10)M to 10(-7)M) was performed in the absence and presence of GABA (10(-5)M). In the presence of GABA, the apparent affinity for flunitrazepam was increased approximately 1.7 fold and the apparent affinity for Ro15-4513 was decreased by 1.7 fold. 4. No alteration in the capacity of GABA to modulate flunitrazepam or Ro15-4513 affinity (e.g. GABA-shift) was observed in cortical membrane preparations either 12 or 72 hr following ethanol cessation. 5. Further, no changes in GABA-modulation of flunitrazepam binding was evident 0, 12, 24, or 72 hr after the last ethanol dose in membranes prepared from cortex, hippocampus or cerebellum. 6. Therefore, results from the present study indicate that the capacity of GABA to modulate receptor affinity for benzodiazepine agonists and inverse-agonists in rat cortex, hippocampus or cerebellum is not altered during withdrawal from chronic ethanol.", 
    "78": "1. Extracellular recordings were made from the Purkinje cell layer of rat cerebellar slices. Compounds were perfused over the slice and bipolar stimulating electrodes placed in the external layer of the slice close to the recording electrode. 2. Stimulus-evoked inhibition of Purkinje layer cell activity was sensitive to bicuculline methiodide and picrotoxin, suggesting it was gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated. The benzodiazepine ligands RU 32007 and Ro 19-0528 reversibly increased the period of inhibition, as did pentobarbital. This benzodiazepine effect was antagonised by Ro 15-1788. 3. Five inverse agonists all reduced the period of stimulated inhibition and this effect was reversed by Ro 15-1788, suggesting the involvement of benzodiazepine receptors. 4. It is concluded that this system provides a convenient physiological and possibly quantitative model for studying the action of benzodiazepine receptor ligands."
