    "0": "In order to elucidate the mechanism of anti-muricide action of psychotropic drugs in the brain, the present study examined influences of these drugs microinjected into the hypothalamus on muricide. Inhibition of muricide by chlorpromazine (CPZ) was found both in the lateral preoptic area (1-POA) and the posterior part of the lateral hypothalamus (p-LH), and that by chlordiazepoxide was seen only the mammillary body. These effects were accompanied by a drowsiness of cortical EEG. Anti-muricide action of tricyclic antidepressants was found in p-LH. The effect was not accompanied by EEG drowsiness. Effects of atropine injected into the hypothalamus on muricide and cortical EEG were similar to those of the antidepressants. Norepinephrine and serotonin did not show selective muricide-suppression. Although either CPZ in 1-POA and p-LH or the antidepressants in p-LH showed cataleptogenic effect, these effects did not appear related to anti-muricide action. The relationship between the anti-muricide action of psychotropic drugs and the physiological functions of the brain was discussed in comparison with these systemic administrations.", 
    "1": "The binding kinetics of [3H]Ro 15-1788, a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to synaptosomal membranes of rat cerebral cortices was studied. [3H]Ro 15-1788 binds with high affinity (dissociation constant, 0.53 nM) to a single class of binding sites (maximal binding capacity, 1.97 pmoles/mg of protein). Equilibrium binding was not affected by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), NaCl, pentobarbital, or pretreatment of the membranes at 37 degrees. Association at 0 degrees was identical whether measured in the absence or presence of GABA or bicuculline methiodide or after preincubation of the membranes at 37 degrees. The association rate under pseudo-first order conditions was curvilinear and consisted of a fast component and a slow component. Dissociation at 0 degrees with 1 X 10(-5)M clonazepam was also curvilinear and could best be fitted by two linear exponential components. The dissociation rate was not altered by GABA, NaCl, pentobarbital, or pretreatment of membranes at 37 degrees. The dissociation rate was similar for 0.1, 1, and 10 nM [3H]Ro 15-1788. The ratio of slow to fast dissociation component for 10 nM [3H]Ro 15-1788 was larger than that for 0.1 and 1 nM [3H]Ro 15-1788. In contrast, the dissociation rate for 20 nM [3H]flunitrazepam ( [3H]FNP) was much greater than that for 2 nM [3H]FNP. Using ligand concentrations occupying the same fraction of receptors, the ratio of slow to fast dissociation components was invariably greater for [3H]Ro 15-1788 than that for [3H]FNP. The rate of dissociation for [3H]Ro 15-1788 was faster under pre-equilibrium conditions than under equilibrium conditions. These results, discussed in terms of the cyclic model of interaction between receptors and benzodiazepines, suggest that [3H]Ro 15-1788 is a powerful ligand in inducing conformational changes in the initial, more labile, binary complex. They also suggest that different conformational states deduced from studies of in vitro binding kinetics may not correspond to the distinct pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines. It is speculated that intrinsic activities of benzodiazepines probably are determined by the step beyond the complex formation and conformational changes suggested to occur by these studies of binding kinetics.", 
    "2": "Suriclone (RP 31,264), like zopiclone (RP 27,267), belongs to the family of cyclopyrrolones and is chemically entirely different from the benzodiazepines (BZDs). However, it possesses a pharmacological profile close to that of the BZDs and proved to be useful in therapeutics as an anxiolytic agent. In the present paper it is shown that suriclone possesses a high affinity for flunitrazepam binding sites and that tritiated suriclone binds specifically with high affinity in rat hippocampus (KD = 0.44 +/- 0.03 nM) and rat cerebellum (KD = 0.53 +/- 0.12 nM). Further, suriclone binding sites are recognized by BZDs or zopiclone, similarly in the two regions. The affinities of four BZD derivatives--nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide--are similar for suriclone and flunitrazepam binding sites. Suriclone binding sites are, like flunitrazepam sites, protected from thermal inactivation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (10 microM), but only flunitrazepam binding is enhanced by GABA. It could be postulated from this that suriclone interacts with a subpopulation of receptors that might be modulated differently from flunitrazepam binding sites. Our results indicate that suriclone could be a new probe for investigating the so-called BZD receptors.", 
    "3": "In a double-blind, cross-over trial, triazolam (0.5 mg) was compared with nitrazepam (5 mg) in patients with disturbed sleep. Each drug was given once, with a 48-h interval, to 40 outpatients. Quality, duration, and latency of sleep, and number of awakenings during the night, showed a significant difference in favour of triazolam. An overall evaluation of sleep also showed triazolam to be superior to nitrazepam. Both drugs seemed to reduce dream activity and to alter the character of the dreams. There was no significant difference in side effects.", 
    "4": "In the 1960s, several studies reported that propranolol and other beta-blocking drugs appeared especially useful in patients with physical symptoms of anxiety. However, subsequent reports produced conflicting findings, and at this time the efficacy of propranolol in anxiety disorders is not clearly established. Propranolol's utility in anxiety states may be entirely restricted to those anxiety patients whose physical symptoms have not adequately responded to benzodiazepine therapy. This places the beta-blockers among the least useful drugs in treating anxiety disorders. A major problem in assessing propranolol's antianxiety properties has been a virtual lack of well-designed studies addressing the issue; the studies reviewed here contained a surprising number of study design problems. Several guidelines regarding study design are included to assist the reader in evaluating studies of antianxiety agents. High dose (e.g., 2,000 mg) propranolol may have a role as an alternative to traditional antipsychotic therapy in neuroleptic-resistant patients. During the last decade a number of studies have demonstrated symptomatic improvement in schizophrenic patients using propranolol alone or combined with neuroleptics. However, four recent double-blind reports have failed to replicate this finding. Future research should focus on possible identification of propranolol-responsive patients and their characteristics. The use of propranolol and other beta-blockers in schizophrenia should remain in the research or medical center setting.", 
    "5": "The anticonvulsive effects of equivalent strengths (ED50) of flunitrazepam and diazepam were compared in 60 Sabra mice injected i.p. with median convulsive (CD50) doses of lidocaine or bupivacaine. Convulsions occurred in 40% of those pretreated with diazepam but were completely prevented in those injected with flunitrazepam. Mortality was much higher in those mice pretreated with diazepam, three having died after the administration of lidocaine and four after bupivacaine. With flunitrazepam pretreatment, there were no deaths after lidocaine and only one after bupivacaine. Flunitrazepam protected these mice against local anesthetic-induced convulsions more effectively than did diazepam.", 
    "6": "We have identified and partially characterised benzodiazepine binding sites in whole brain membranes of male rainbow trout. In terms of Bmax and KD values trout brain receptors are remarkably similar to those in rat and human brain. The Hill coefficient was 0.98, indicating a single binding site. GABA (10(-4) M) was able to significantly elevate binding of [3H]-FNZ through a change in KD rather than Bmax. This effect was prevented by the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide.", 
    "7": "Thirty-three healthy male and female volunteers aged 21 to 87 years received a single 0.5 mg oral dose of triazolam. Plasma triazolam concentrations were measured in multiple samples drawn during 24 h after the dose. Mean triazolam elimination half-life was not significantly different between young and elderly men (3.0 vs 4.6 h), nor between young and elderly women (2.7 vs 3.2 h). However, apparent oral clearance of triazolam was significantly reduced in elderly as compared to young groups of both sexes, leading to higher peak plasma concentrations and increased total area under the curve. Values of half-life and clearance of antipyrine, a low-extraction hepatically oxidized compound, were poorly correlated with those of triazolam (r = 0.34 and 0.44, respectively), suggesting different mechanisms controlling age-related changes in clearance of these two hepatically oxidized drugs.", 
    "8": "The solubility of lorazepam in aqueous i.v. solutions and the potential for lorazepam sorption from i.v. admixtures in flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and tubing were determined. The solubility of triplicate samples containing 15 mg of lorazepam and 20 ml of deionized water, 5% dextrose, lactated Ringer's, or 0.9% sodium chloride injections was determined. The decrease in lorazepam concentration from a 40-micrograms/ml admixture solution in 5% dextrose injection stored in PVC bags was calculated. Duplicate samples of (1) 50 ml in 50-ml PVC bags, (2) 100 ml in 50-ml PVC bags, and (3) 100 ml in 250-ml PVC bags were laid flat to approximate surface areas of 80, 160, and 270 sq cm, respectively, to determine sorptive loss. The continuous flow sorption of lorazepam from duplicate admixtures was tested at three rates through 180- and 350-cm PVC tubing. The solubility of lorazepam in deionized water, 5% dextrose, lactated Ringer's, and 0.9% sodium chloride injections was 0.054, 0.062, 0.055, and 0.027 mg/ml, respectively. Lorazepam solubility was pH dependent. The decrease in lorazepam concentration from the admixture solution stored in PVC bags for up to 121 hours followed biexponential kinetics that account for both the sorptive loss of the drug and the increasing ratio of bag surface area to solution volume. At least 90% of the initial concentration was maintained for five and two hours when the ratio was less than 2.0 and 2.7-2.8 sq cm/ml, respectively. The admixture solution retained a minimum of 95% of initial concentration when 50-ml aliquots were delivered at 600, 200, and 100 ml/hr through both sizes of PVC tubing. Because of its adequate aqueous solubility and slow sorption by PVC delivery components, lorazepam is suited for dilution in i.v. admixtures for treating conditions with intermittent or continuous infusions.", 
    "9": "The hypothesis that the nerve endings of the dopamine projection of the frontal cortex lack autoreceptors for regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase was tested by using the preferential inhibitors of dopamine autoreceptors, molindole and buspirone. In contrast to haloperidol, which elevates dopamine metabolism in the striatum and frontal cortex, both molindone and buspirone elicited little change in dopamine metabolism in the frontal cortex at doses up to 3.0 mg/kg, which cause the same maximal response in the corpus striatum as does haloperidol. Thus, the lack of autoreceptors in the frontal cortex is of pharmacological importance. That preferential inhibition of striatal dopamine autoreceptors may reverse catalepsy by enhancing synthesis and release of dopamine was tested by first inducing catalepsy with different drugs and then administering molindone or buspirone. Only buspirone (1.0 mg/kg) reversed catalepsy. This effect does not require presynaptic dopamine as catalepsy was reversed by buspirone in the dopamine-depleted rat (with 2.0 mg/kg R04-1284) as well as after postsynaptic dopamine receptor blockade by haloperidol of cis-flupenthixol. Thus, the mechanism for the reversal of catalepsy appears to be located efferent from the dopamine neuron. Buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anti-anxiety drug, may prove useful for treatment of extrapyramidal motor disorders of either iatrogenic or idiosyncratic origin.", 
    "10": "The excretion of temazepam and its N-desmethyl metabolite, oxazepam, and their respective O-conjugates was examined following a single intravenous dose of [14C]temazepam to two groups of bile fistula rats, with and without bile replenishment to the animals via duodenal cannulae. During an 8-hr collection period, the two groups produced virtually identical bile volumes, and there were no significant differences between them in the amount of total radioactivity, free temazepam, or the identified metabolites in the bile, as determined by TLC and liquid scintillation counting. Elimination of the radioactive dose was rapid during 0-8 hr, with a half-life of approximately 1 hr. Approximately 85-90% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the bile: less than 1% as free temazepam, 3% as oxazepam, and approximately 10% as their O-conjugates.", 
    "11": "Intracranial dose response relationships for the water-soluble benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and midazolam, were performed by injecting the drugs through cannulae chronically indwelling in the median raphe nucleus of male albino rats. Drugs were administered in doses of 0.0, 0.22, 0.44, 0.88 and 1.75 nmole in 0.5 microliters saline. Both midazolam and flurazepam produced hyperactivity which was most prominent within the first 30 minutes post-injection. Flurazepam, furthermore, proved twice as potent as midazolam. Chlordiazepoxide, in contrast, was without effect at any of the doses tested. This observation supports the view that chlordiazepoxide is a pro-drug which must be metabolized to form an active metabolite. In another experiment, animals received either saline or a sub-effective dose (0.22 nmole) of flurazepam or midazolam into the median raphe nucleus 5 minutes prior to either a subeffective dose of muscimol (0.22 nmole) or saline. Only the combinations of a benzodiazepine plus muscimol produced hyperactivity. These combinations, moreover, produced effects as robust as those of a 4-fold higher dose of muscimol alone (0.88 nmole). Other animals received either saline or bicuculline methiodide (0.88 nmole). Bicuculline did not affect activity level, but completely blocked the hyperkinetic effects of muscimol. These data suggest that the hyperactivity effect of intra-raphe muscimol is due to activation of GABA receptors within the midbrain raphe, rather than at distant sites. In addition, the data suggest that the intra-raphe administration of certain benzodiazepines produces hyperactivity by facilitating GABA transmission.", 
    "12": "Sinclair (S-1) miniature swine were given access to a mixture of ethanol and beer for three years. Control swine were fed an isocaloric diet with corn starch substituted for ethanol. Both groups had free access to tap water. The alcohol group consumed about 4 g ethanol/kg/day (about 50% of their caloric intake) resulting in plasma ethanol concentrations of about 100 mg/dl. Brain membranes were prepared for analysis of neurotransmitter receptor binding, membrane lipid composition and physical properties. Receptor studies demonstrated an increase in the binding of 3H-GABA to cortical and cerebellar membranes from the alcoholic pigs as compared to control. Binding of 3H-ligands to muscarine cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic, dopamine and benzodiazepine receptors was not changed by chronic ethanol ingestion. These results are similar to those obtained in studies of human alcoholics by other investigators. The cholesterol content of myelin and synaptic plasma membranes was not altered by ethanol consumption. The fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, a measure of membrane order, did not detect any differences in the membranes from control or alcohol-treated swine either before or after in vitro exposure to ethanol. These results are different from those reported for rodents after short-term ethanol treatments and emphasize the importance of evaluating different models of experimental alcoholism.", 
    "13": "A method for the removal of an endogenous inhibitor(s) of benzodiazepine receptor binding (extraction in distilled water at 20 degrees) was used to evaluate the possible influence of this inhibitor(s) on the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor in vivo. The results indicate that the presence of an inhibitor(s) in the concentration which exists in the rat brain leads to a 30-fold increase in the Kd value as compared with the results obtained in vitro. The endogenous inhibitor(s) appeared to be a thermostable, proteinase K-resistant substance(s) with Mr between 500 and 10,000 daltons. Repeated washings of the brain tissue with distilled water were accompanied by a decrease in the Bmax for [3H]flunitrazepam. The [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites with Kd = 1.7 nM and Bmax = 61 fmoles/mg of protein were found in the supernatant collected after the second and third washings in distilled water. The presence of diazepam and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 prevented in a dose-dependent manner the decrease in the Bmax value for [3H]flunitrazepam during the tissue washing with distilled water.", 
    "14": "Anxiety dreams and night terrors have been reported as complications of single-dose bedtime administration of both tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics. Five cases are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of diazepam and its close relative clorazepate in controlling this problem. The clinical usefulness and possible mechanisms of action of these agents in treating sleep disorder are discussed.", 
    "15": "The effects of oral contraceptive steroids (OCS) on the disposition and elimination of lorazepam, oxazepam, and chlordiazepoxide were examined. Lorazepam and oxazepam are metabolized via glucuronidation while chlordiazepoxide is metabolized by oxidation in the liver. The disposition and elimination of lorazepam, oxazepam, and chlordiazepoxide was studied in females not taking OCS and females taking OCS (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg; ethinyl estradiol, 50 micrograms) for 6 months or more. The t1/2 (beta) for lorazepam was significantly reduced in women taking OCS (6.0 +/- 3.1 vs. 14.0 +/- 6.2 hr) (p less than 0.005) as compared to controls, and the t1/2 (beta) for oxazepam was reduced in women taking OCS (7.71 +/- 3.23 vs. 12.09 +/- 5.08 hr) as compared to controls, but did not reach statistical significance. The plasma clearance of both lorazepam and oxazepam was significantly increased in women taking OCS [(288.9 +/- 165.9 vs. 77.5 +/- 3.29 ml per min) (p less than 0.01) and (251.2 +/- 106.9 vs. 97.86 +/- 69.4 ml per min) (p less than 0.01), respectively] as compared to controls. The volumes of distribution of lorazepam and oxazepam were significantly increased in women taking OCS (p less than 0.05) while plasma binding of these drugs was similar in both groups. In contrast, the t1/2 (beta) of chlordiazepoxide was significantly prolonged (20.58 +/- 8.08 vs. 11.63 +/- 5.91 hr) (p less than 0.05), and the plasma clearance was significantly reduced (13.41 +/- 4.69 vs. 33.22 +/- 12.37 ml per min) (p less than 0.05) in the OCS group as compared to controls. The volumes of distribution of chlordiazepoxide were similar in both groups, and the plasma binding of chlordiazepoxide tended to be lower in the OCS group but did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that OCS exert a differential effect on the elimination of benzodiazepines, whereby oxidation of chlordiazepoxide is impaired while the glucuronidation of lorazepam and oxazepam is enhanced by OCS.", 
    "16": "The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine anxiolytic-antidepressant, were assessed in 32 healthy men and women aged 21 to 78 years after a single 1.0-mg oral dose. Peak alprazolam levels averaged 20.4 ng/mL and were reached a mean of 1.25 hours after dosage. Mean elimination half-life did not differ significantly between elderly and young women, nor did total metabolic clearance. However, half-life was significantly prolonged, and total clearance significantly reduced, in elderly v young men. Antipyrine oxidizing capacity was also evaluated, and half-life for the two drugs was highly correlated, as were their metabolic clearances. Thus, old age is associated with impaired capacity to oxidize alprazolam, but this effect is far more apparent in men than in women. A test of antipyrine half-life and clearance may help identify slow or rapid metabolizers of alprazolam.", 
    "17": "The effects of several psychoactive drugs on raphe unit activity in freely moving cats was compared with drug-induced effects in chloral hydrate anesthetized cats. The anesthesia greatly potentiated the depressant effects of LSD, phenoxybenzamine, clonidine, methiothepin, clozapine, and chlorimipramine on raphe units, but partially antagonized the depressant effects of diazepam. These results demonstrate that apparently discrepant reports of the affects of these drugs on raphe neurons in anesthetized rats versus freely moving cats are attributable to the use of anesthesia in rat studies. These data underscore the importance of conducting such drug studies in awake, freely moving animals, for which the results would be far more relevant to the issue of human drug use.", 
    "18": "A recent hypothesis suggests that the \"selective anxiolytic\" activity of the triazolopyridazine, CL 218872, is a reflection of this compounds high affinity for a benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor subtype. Subsequent to this proposal, the observation was made that CL 218872 does not effectively discriminate BZD receptor subtypes in vitro at physiological temperatures (37 degrees C). Based upon this observation, a selective effect in vivo related to the high affinity of CL 218872 for a BZD receptor subtype appears unlikely. The present study provides evidence for an alternative hypothesis to explain the unique pharmacological properties of CL 218872. The ability of CL 218872 to antagonize diazepam induced loss of righting reflex and enhance the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam in mice suggests that this triazolopyridazine may act as a partial agonist at the BZD receptor. Compared to the pharmacologically active BZDs, the unique actions of CL 218872 may be related to the lower intrinsic activity of this compound.", 
    "19": "Our purpose was to investigate the action on memory disorders of patients over sixty years of age of a well tolerated sedative neuroleptic, tiapride, and of a short-half-life benzodiazepine, lorazepam. Thirty subjects divided into two groups were entered in a three week trial. The product's effect on both anterograde memory and remote memory was assessed by the simple memory test used. Statistical conclusions show that tiapride is very significantly superior to lorazepam in every studied criterion, with disinhibition and stimulation of vigilance. These hypotheses need to be confirmed.", 
    "20": "A series of measurements of the potency of 26 benzodiazepines (BDZs) to inhibit the binding of [3H]diazepam to rat brain synaptosomal membranes has been undertaken. All compounds studied are NO2 or Cl 7-substituted, a class of BDZs known to have the highest biological activities and binding affinities (expressed as Ki). The results show that: (a) 2'-unsubstituted BDZs display a parabolic dependence of -log Ki values on lipophilic character of the molecule (expressed by means of the chromatographic Rm value); (b) 2'-halogen substituted BDZs show quite high binding affinities (ki values in the range 2-5 nM) giving rise to another class of BDZs whose dependence on the lipophilic character remains to be studied; and (c) BDZs lacking the carbonyl oxygen at position 2 (see Table 1), and having an oxygen at position 4, show low or very low binding affinities (Ki values in the range 600-7000 nM). Moreover for the compounds under examination, statistically significant correlations have been obtained between -log Ki values and psychopharmacological activity data.", 
    "21": "Diazepam (5 mg/kg, ip) and tracazolate (40 mg/kg, ip), a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic, blocked electrically-induced head-turning without producing sedation. Bicuculline and picrotoxin, GABA antagonists, at doses not affecting head-turning (2 mg/kg, ip) antagonized the effects of diazepam and tracazolate on head-turning. However, at the same dose, bicuculline was more effective as an antagonist of diazepam whereas picrotoxin was more effective as an antagonist of tracazolate. These results suggest that benzodiazepine as well as nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics possess GABAmimetic activity. The difference in potency between bicuculline and picrotoxin as antagonists of diazepam and tracazolate may be related to their reported differences as GABA antagonists (e.g., site of receptor interaction).", 
    "22": "The effects of flurazepam and diazepam, benzodiazepine derivatives, on contractions (or contractures) induced by Ca++, K+ or norepinephrine were examined in the isolated canine coronary artery and thoracic aorta. Ca++-Induced contraction was evoked by cumulative addition of CaCl2 to Ca++-depleted K+-depolarizing solution; K+: and norepinephrine-induced contractions were evoked by cumulative addition of KCl and norepinephrine, respectively, to the medium. Flurazepam and diazepam (1 X 10(-5), 3 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M for coronary artery; 3 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M for thoracic aorta) shifted the dose-response curves for KCl downwards in a non-competitive manner, and shifted the dose-response curves for CaCl2 to the right in a competitive manner. Ca++-Induced contracture was inhibited completely by addition of flurazepam or diazepam (1 X 10(-4) M), and the inhibition was reversed dose-dependently by addition of CaCl2. Flurazepam and diazepam (3 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M) shifted the dose-response curves for norepinephrine both rightwards and downwards in the thoracic aorta. These findings suggest that flurazepam and diazepam inhibit Ca++-influx into the cells (Ca++-antagonistic effect), causing relaxation and inhibition of K+-, Ca++-, or norepinephrine-induced contraction (or contracture) of the vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "23": "1 The effect of oral doses of diazepam (5 mg) and oxprenolol (80 mg) on short term memory of normal individuals stratified for 'state' anxiety levels has been investigated. 2 Normal student volunteers were stratified into high and low anxiety groups on the basis of responses to the Spielberger 'A-state' scale. Subjects were then randomly administered active drug or placebo and given a form of running memory test performed under a variety of conditions in which variable rate of item presentation and articulatory suppression were used. 3 Diazepam significantly reduced the errors of recall in the running memory test in the high anxiety group and produced a distinct separation of response from the low anxiety group under the test conditions of slow item presentation with articulatory suppression. Oxprenolol had no effect on the short term memory test in either high or low anxiety groups in any experimental test situation. 4 These results are compared to previous work in which generally a deleterious effect of diazepam on short term memory in normal volunteers has been reported. The implications of these findings are further discussed in relationship to possible models of memory function.", 
    "24": "The effect of other anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbitone and primidone) on serum clonazepam concentrations has been studied. Serum clonazepam concentrations were measured in 47 epileptic patients in whom a dose of clonazepam (3 mg or 6 mg) was added to existing therapy. 44 patients were receiving other anticonvulsants; 3 were not receiving any other medication. Patients on low doses of other anticonvulsants showed high clonazepam concentrations. Patients on multiple therapy with high doses of other anticonvulsants showed excessive side-effects on clonazepam and low serum clonazepam concentrations. We conclude that other anticonvulsants may reduce serum clonazepam concentrations and therefore that clonazepam is best given alone.", 
    "25": "Tofizopam, an anxiolytic 3,4-benzodiazepine, increases the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors for 1,4-benzodiazepines. In this study we investigated whether this increased affinity of the receptors alters the sensitivity of mice to tremor and to convulsions. Convulsions induced by harmane were not affected by tofizopam (50-300 mg/kg), but diazepam (15 mg/kg) increased the ED50 of harmane from 9.9 to 25.1 mg/kg. Tofizopam did not alter the threshold for electroshock-induced convulsions, while a dose of 10 mg/kg diazepam protected mice from convulsions. Low doses of tofizopam (12.5-25 mg/kg) sensitized mice to the tremorogenic effect of harmaline. Diazepam inhibited tremor: the ED50 of harmaline increased by 153% after 50 mg/kg of diazepam. In contrast to 1,4-benzodiazepines, tofizopam has no anticonvulsive effect. It sensitises mice to the tremor induced by harmaline. In combination with diazepam, however, tofizopam enhanced the anticonvulsive and antitremorogenic actions of this 1,4-benzodiazepine by 12-65%. This effect probably results from a tofizopam-induced increase in the occupation of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "26": "We report a patient in whom extreme hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and a residual pancerebellar syndrome occurred while taking a combination of perphenazine and amitriptyline. We postulate that impaired thermoregulation due to psychotropic drugs was responsible for the development of heat stroke and that the cerebellar syndrome resulted directly from the elevated temperature.", 
    "27": "Several new factors have recently been shown to influence the pharmacokinetics of atropine. Age appears to have a clear effect on the elimination of atropine: for example, prolonged elimination has been found in children under 2 years of age and in the elderly. The higher sensitivity of these patients to the effects of atropine can be explained, at least partly, by this phenomenon. Due to the fast placental transfer of atropine, i.v. administration before cesarean section can have strong effects on the newborn. Most important, however, it decreases the barrier pressure of the lower cardioesophageal sphincter (pulmonary aspiration). Thus, routine atropine premedication is contraindicated before cesarean section. On the other hand, children appear to need a routine anticholinergic premedicant. Without it profuse salivary secretion may interfere with anesthesia. The use of atropine in premedication of healthy adult patients is controversial. Because peroral premedication (benzodiazepines) is nowadays increasing in the adult patient, especially in the elderly, routine use of atropine should be avoided.", 
    "28": "Effect of diazepam on sleep in man was investigated in a series of placebo controlled studies and the data on various measures from two groups (young adults and middle age) were retrospectively analysed. Variability of the measures between the two groups with placebo was not different, but the variability of their response to the drug was different, and that of the middle aged group was high. In the young adults there were drug effects, but in the middle aged group no drug effects could be established. The studies suggest that variability of data must be taken into consideration when it is used to indicate the most appropriate dose range. If the variability of response is low the data may indicate the likely effect of the drug on each individual. On the other hand if the variability is high then data obtained from analysis of the group may have limited relevance, and suggest doses which are too high for the majority of the individuals within that group.", 
    "29": "Amygdaloid kindled rats were utilized to determine the effects of the respiratory stimulant, doxapram (7.5-60 mg/kg) on seizures elicited by suprathreshold or threshold electrical stimulation. For comparison, a single dose of pentylenetetrazol (30 mg/kg), phenobarbital (40 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) were also tested in the same paradigm. With suprathreshold stimulation, doxapram did not increase the intensity of seizures. Neither the afterdischarge duration (AD) nor the behavioral rank (BR) were increased with doses high enough to cause systemic signs of toxicity. Similarly, the convulsant pentylenetetrazol did not increase AD or BR after suprathreshold stimulation. The anticonvulsants phenobarbital and diazepam significantly reduced both AD and BR after suprathreshold stimulation. Seizure thresholds tended to be higher after the various doses of doxapram with no consistent effect on elicited AD or BR. Pentylenetetrazol did not change threshold values, but was found to increase AD and BR at threshold. Both phenobarbital and diazepam raised thresholds with a significant decrease in elicited AD and BR. It would appear that the respiratory stimulant doxapram has little proconvulsant activity in this model of epilepsy.", 
    "30": "Studies were performed to elucidate the effects of brotizolam, a newly synthesized thienodiazepine, chemically related to the benzodiazepines, on dopamine turnover in the limbic forebrain and neostriatum. Intraperitoneally administered brotizolam retarded the rate of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-induced depletion of dopamine in the olfactory tubercle (OT), nucleus accumbens (NA) and caudate nucleus (CN). Significant retardation was observed with brotizolam in doses ranging from 0.1-10 mg/kg in the olfactory tubercle, and from 1-10 mg/kg in the nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus. These inhibitory effects of brotizolam were antagonized by bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, in all of the regions examined. Using slices of the olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus, the effects of brotizolam on dopaminergic nerve terminals were examined in vitro. Basal release of dopamine was not affected by brotizolam in concentrations up to 10(-6) M; however, K+-stimulated release of dopamine was significantly reduced by brotizolam at 10(-7) M or above. The reduction of K+-stimulated release of dopamine was antagonized by bicuculline, added in the superfusion medium. These data suggest that brotizolam inhibits the release of dopamine in the limbic forebrain and neostriatal systems probably through mechanisms including a facilitation of GABAergic action on dopaminergic nerve terminals.", 
    "31": "Experiments were performed on nine dogs instrumented with pulmonary artery Swan-Ganz catheters and catheters placed into the distal aorta and posterior caval vein. Electromagnetic flowmeter probes were placed around the portal vein and hepatic artery, and the portal vein was cannulated. A week later, systemic and splanchnic circulatory variables were studied before and after 10 mg/kg of midazolam given intravenously. Three minutes after injection, heart rate increased 26% (P less than 0.006), cardiac index decreased 15% (P less than 0.001), portal flow increased 19% (P greater than 0.05), and hepatic arterial flow decreased slightly (P less than 0.002). Later, portal blood flow decreased 17% below baseline values (P less than 0.006). The biphasic response of portal blood flow to midazolam is probably related to redistribution of blood within the splanchnic system (blood mobilization from spleen and intestine). It is suggested that because maintenance of cardiac output during midazolam anesthesia depends on compensatory mechanisms, failure to increase cardiac output with compensatory increases in heart rate, contractility, and blood volume mobilization from the splanchnic circulation could result in decreased cardiac output.", 
    "32": "The effects of intravenous suxamethonium chloride (1 mg/kg) on intra-ocular pressure (IOP) were studied following pretreatment with diazepam 0.05 mg/kg, tubocurarine 0.05 mg/kg, and in a control group, at induction of anaesthesia. In all three groups, a significant increase in IOP was seen during the induction sequence. In a further study, the effects of intravenous suxamethonium chloride (1 mg/kg) on IOP were studied following a period of stable general anaesthesia and pretreatment with diazepam 0.05 mg/kg. A significant rise in IOP was again seen following the administration of suxamethonium. The authors conclude that neither of the techniques described herein will reliably and predictably prevent the rise in IOP seen following the use of suxamethonium.", 
    "33": "Insomnia--the chronic inability to obtain the amount and quality of sleep needed for effective daytime function--is a common subjective complaint. Several major causes exist, and many strategems can be used in management. When drugs are indicated, the benzodiazepines are the first choice. Flurazepam, a long-acting compound, has recently been complemented by temazepam, a shorter-acting hypnotic. The pharmacokinetics, actions, and clinical uses of temazepam are reviewed. It is concluded that temazepam is preferable where daytime alertness must be unimpaired, with flurazepam reserved for patients who need daytime sedation.", 
    "34": "A patient who developed phlebitis from the intravenous administration of diazepam is described. This episode resolved in two days after treatment with moist heat packs. Three days after complete resolution, the phlebitis recurred approximately eight hours after a single oral dose of diazepam. This recurrence of phlebitis resolved slowly over seven days, with warm soaking and aspirin therapy. Oral diazepam may have exacerbated the initial phlebitis by interfering with a subclinical healing process.", 
    "35": "Letters in correspondence columns or brief reports in medical journals are an essential part of an early warning system, and they are invaluable in alerting clinicians and clinical pharmacists to associations between drugs and their reactions. A survey of the literature during the first half of 1982 has identified a number of these early reports; some are purely anecdotal, others may be coincidental, but all serve to warn the practitioner of potential hazard. Brief information on the following reports of drug-drug interactions is given in this article with the intention of giving these reports wider publicity and, possibly, encouraging further observation and research to establish or disprove their validity in a larger and wider range of patients or volunteer subjects. The following interactions are reviewed: amiodarone-quinidine, lidocaine-prenylamine, erythromycin-carbamazepine, azapropazone-phenytoin, chlordiazepoxide-levodopa, gentamicin-furosemide, ethanol-aspirin, acetaminophen-coumarin anticoagulant, and cimetidine-lidocaine.", 
    "36": "A patient had seizures triggered by spontaneous blinking associated with the act of beginning to speak. Diffuse paroxysmal discharges in the EEG appeared when the patient was blinking in darkness or in bright light. Closing the eyes voluntarily, on command, or as a reflex reaction produced this response very infrequently. During intermittent photic stimulation the epileptic discharges were accompanied by myoclonic jerks. The act of beginning to speak was linked with spontaneous blinking and EEG changes and was accompanied consistently by seizures. These were characterized by a peculiar stuttering and an absencelike impairment of consciousness. Seizures have been controlled well using clonazepam and valproic acid.", 
    "37": "Squirrel monkeys responded under a two-component fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation with both nonpunishment and punishment components. In both components of the multiple schedule, every 30th key-pressing response resulted in food presentation. In the punishment component, the first response in each 30-response fixed ratio also produced either an i.v. injection of nicotine (10-30 micrograms/kg) or an electric shock (1-5 mA). Response-produced nicotine injections or electric shocks functioned similarly to suppress responding by over 70% in the punishment component. Presession treatment with chlordiazepoxide (5.6-10 mg/kg i.m.) markedly increased responding that had been suppressed by either nicotine injection or electric shock. In contrast, presession treatment with the nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine (0.1-0.3 mg/kg i.m.) increased responding that had been suppressed by nicotine injection but did not increase responding that had been suppressed by electric shock. Thus, chlordiazepoxide appeared to have general rate-increasing effects on suppressed responding, regardless of the nature of the event suppressing responding, whereas mecamylamine appeared to selectively antagonize the suppressant effects of nicotine. Doses of chloridazepoxide and mecamylamine that increased suppressed responding in punishment components either had little effect on or slightly increased responding in nonpunishment components. These results show that under suitable environmental conditions response-produced i.v. injection of nicotine can function effectively as a punisher.", 
    "38": "The variety of drug induced patterns of pathological eye movements is reviewed with emphasis on hydantoins, barbiturates, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines, amitriptyline and alcohol. These different substances may be analogous or distinct in their site of action within the labyrinths, brain stem and cerebellum. Ocular oscillations are described in correlation to drug uptake or serum levels such as positional, downbeat, gaze evoked, periodic alternating nystagmus as well as saccadic pursuit, slowing down of saccades, alteration of VOR gain or suppression by fixation, internuclear and complete ophthalmoplegia. Most of the ocular motor disturbances are possibly due to a pharmacologically induced transient dysfunction of the vestibulo-cerebellar flocculus loop.", 
    "39": "Recovery time, the effect of sedation or amnesia on postoperative pain, and patients' opinions of the sedation were studied. Forty operations were performed on 20 patients. Each patient had four impacted third molars removed in two sessions, one in which a new emulsion form of diazepam (Diazemuls) was used, and one in which no sedation was used. The recovery from sedation was found to be very individual and not related to the dose administered, as assessed by a simple, easy-to-use method. There was no difference in postoperative pain between the sedated and unsedated groups, and we found no correlation between postoperative pain and amnesia. Eighty-five per cent of the patients preferred sedation during surgery, even though none of them had a preoperative indication for sedation.", 
    "40": "The hypothesis was tested that sedation and stereotyped behaviour, developing in rats after the administration of the steroid derivative with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonistic properties, R 5135, are of an epileptiform nature. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were recorded and behaviour was observed over not less than 5-7 hr after subconvulsive doses of R 5135. Doses of 2-4 mg/kg of the compound produced quasi-rhythmic spikes resembling experimental focal epileptic discharges in all rats. This epileptiform activity was accompanied by behavioural sedation and somnolence, followed by a build-up of stereotyped behaviour and sporadic episodes of epileptiform motor activity, developing 1-2 hr after injection. The secondary components (SNW) of the visual evoked potentials were suppressed by R 5135 and the primary potential (N1) facilitated, virtually reducing the visual evoked potential to the form of an evoked spike. Pretreatment with the anticonvulsant GABAergic drugs gamma-acetylenic GABA (GAG) (100 mg/kg), sodium valproate (VPA) (400 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg) suppressed the motor components of seizure activity, producing severe ataxia, but not the electrographic manifestation of seizure activity. Neither gamma-acetylenic GABA nor valproate significantly altered the latency to onset of spiking, although all three drugs did significantly reduce the frequency of discharges. Diazepam was the only anticonvulsant tested which completely suppressed spike activity in 3 of 5 rats. Moreover, R 5135 was found to antagonize diazepam, but not valproate induced suppression of secondary components of the visual evoked potential, suggesting that diazepam and R 5135 may compete for the same receptor.", 
    "41": "EEG monitoring was performed on a group of ten children, aged 3 days to 13 years, during admission to the Paediatric Clinic at the University of Bologna for seizures. Diazepam was injected by rectal route as an anticonvulsant, using a dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg in the first nine children, whereas an intravenous bolus was administered to the last child. The main aim of this study was to document the time taken for the drug to reach the brain and to modify the electrical activity. We observed significant EEG changes between 1 and 9.30 min and, in particular, the appearance of fast activity over one or both hemispheres after rectal diazepam. The EEG results confirm the clinical efficacy of rectal diazepam.", 
    "42": "Homozygous tottering mice (tg, autosomal recessive) exhibit frequent spontaneous \"absence\" seizures accompanied by bilaterally synchronous spike-and-wave or polyspike electrocorticographic discharges. In adult tottering mice, the antiepileptic effects of a single dose of ethosuximide, diazepam, phenobarbital, or phenytoin were assessed using continuous electrocorticographic recording to monitor seizure incidence. The dose chosen for each drug was selected to correspond to an effective antiepileptic dose in standard murine models. Ethosuximide, 150 mg/kg, diazepam, 1.4 mg/kg, and phenobarbital, 25 mg/kg were effective against absence seizures. In contrast, phenytoin at 5, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg produced no significant reduction in the incidence of absence seizures. These results suggest that absence seizures in the tottering mutant may represent a relatively specific pharmacological model for the identification of drugs effective for clinical absence epilepsy, and emphasize the potential value of this new model for the study of fundamental mechanisms of absence of epilepsy and the actions of antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "43": "A characterization of the benzodiazepine receptor in vivo was carried out utilizing the up-and-down method for a quantitative determination of the maximal seizure threshold to diazepam. Wistar-Imamichi male rats of 21 days of age were used. The drug concentration in the brain at the steady-state was measured with radiolabeled diazepam. A kinetic analysis for the dose-response relation obtained gave 2.2 microM and 1.6 for the Kd and n, respectively, in the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The results suggested the existence of a hitherto undiscovered endogenous ligand(s) suppressing the binding of benzodiazepine to the receptor, as compared with those in the in vitro binding-assay reported by other investigators. A chronic pretreatment with diazepam once a day for 13 days (0.2 and 2 mg/kg, s.c.) produced receptor tolerance, but did not affect the amount of the seizure threshold unless the drug was acutely administered 10 min before the electric shock. These results supported the argument that two distinct entities exist for both GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites which are closely related to each other in their functioning.", 
    "44": "Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP), an amino acid modifying reagent, causes complete inactivation of particulate and deoxycholate-solubilized benzodiazepine-receptors from calf cerebral cortex. No heterogeneity was observed in DEP-sensitivity of the receptors. Protection from DEP-induced inactivation was provided by the centrally active benzodiazepines, diazepam and nitrazepam, but not by the peripherally active Ro5-4864, suggesting that DEP modifies a residue which is essential for the central actions of benzodiazepines. GABA did not protect against inactivation or influence the protection afforded by diazepam, indicating that the DEP-modifiable residue is independent of GABA binding sites, or that GABA binding sites are also sensitive to DEP. DEP-induced inactivation of benzodiazepine-receptors proceeds much faster at pH 10.1 than at pH 8.1 or 6.0, indicating the modification of a high pKa side group, possibly the phenol of a tyrosyl residue. This postulation is in accord with our previous findings with the modifying reagents tetranitromethane and N-acetylimidazole.", 
    "45": "Two effects of flurazepam have been studied on electrophysiological responses to muscimol in a slice preparation of rat cuneate nucleus. Flurazepam potentiated the responses to muscimol and also reduced the antagonism of these responses by picrotoxin. Repeated series of experiments over a 3 year period showed significant variations in the potentiation of muscimol by flurazepam which were negatively correlated with the apparent reduction in picrotoxin potency. A more reproducible reduction in picrotoxin potency by flurazepam was obtained when the data were re-calculated to take account of the possibility that picrotoxin might antagonize the potentiating effect of flurazepam as well as the direct response to muscimol. The simplest explanation of this relationship is that flurazepam and picrotoxin mutually antagonize each others effects on the GABA system. The underlying cause of the variation in flurazepam effect remains unknown.", 
    "46": "Previous studies have shown that [3H]flunitrazepam forms irreversible cross-links with brain tissue when exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. Comparison of the amount of [3H]flunitrazepam irreversibly incorporated and the number of benzodiazepine binding sites blocked after photolabeling has indicated that several binding sites are inactivated for each molecule of [3H]flunitrazepam incorporated. To learn the cause of this discrepancy, binding to the benzodiazepine binding sites has been examined using several radiolabeled benzodiazepine antagonists. Binding of a beta-carboline ester, CGS-8216, and Ro 15-1788 was not altered by photolabeling; however, displacement studies revealed that photolabeling converted a homogeneous set of benzodiazepine binding sites into two subsets: one of high affinity (unaltered sites) and one of low affinity. The low affinity sites could be detected by displacement studies of antagonist binding by benzodiazepines, and conversion to a low affinity form accounts for the discrepancy observed after photolabeling using [3H]flunitrazepam as ligand.", 
    "47": "Long-term normal-dose benzodiazepine treatment in seven patients was associated with reduced urinary excretion of MOPEG (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylglycol). Following the discontinuation of the drugs a characteristic withdrawal reaction occurred, with an increase towards normal values of the MOPEG excretion levels and changes in the excretion of 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid). No significant changes in the 24-hr urinary excretion of free cortisol or HMMA (3-methoxy-hydroxy-mandelic acid) were detected.", 
    "48": "Twenty-seven consecutive patients were treated with 3 mg oral lorazepam and 2.5 mg intravenous haloperidol in an effort to improve patient tolerance of cytotoxic chemotherapy and decrease nausea and vomiting. Antiemetic efficacy and side-effects were assessed using a patient questionnaire. Vomiting either did not occur, or was considered to be of only moderate intensity in 22 patients (81%) and usually ceased within 24 hours of commencing chemotherapy. Similarly, nausea was either absent or of only moderate severity, lasting less than 48 hours in the majority of patients. Eight of 11 patients who had received similar previous cytotoxic treatment with antiemetic agents but not lorazepam considered that lorazepam and haloperidol had considerably improved their tolerance of chemotherapy. The side-effects of haloperidol and lorazepam were mild and well tolerated.", 
    "49": "Severely anxious hospitalized patients were treated with rapidly increasing doses of two benzodiazepine compounds to test the feasibility of rapid pharmacotherapy of the condition. Twenty-one subjects completing the study all obtained substantial relief from symptoms; in only three subjects were symptoms completely eliminated. No serious side effects were encountered.", 
    "50": "Differences between the pharmacological effects of bromazepam given by oral and rectal administration were investigated in mice and rats. 1) Bromazepam dose-dependently prolonged the sleeping time induced by thiopental-Na, ethanol and ether by both administration routes. 2) The analgesic action of bromazepam was recognized by the hot-plate method and the algolytic test. In the hot-plate test, analgesic actions of morphine and pentazocine were potentiated by bromazepam in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg by both routes. 3) The muscle relaxant effect of bromazepam administered rectally was more potent than that administered orally in the inclined screen test and the rotarod test. This effect of bromazepam by rectal administration was approximately 2 times as potent as that by oral administration. 4) Bromazepam inhibited the convulsion induced by maximum electric shock, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin. In pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion, the inhibitory effect of bromazepam administered rectally was 2 times as potent as that administered orally. In the other convulsion test, no significant differences between oral and rectal administration could be recognized. 5) Hyperemotionality and muricide (mouse-killing behaviour) of rats with bilateral olfactory bulb ablations (OB rat) were reduced by oral and rectal administrations of bromazepam in a dose-dependent manner. The effects by rectal administration were more potent than that by oral administration. Bromazepam was approximately 20 times as potent as diazepam administered by the same route. Fighting behaviour in mice subjected to footshock was suppressed by rectal administration of bromazepam, and this effect was as same as that by oral administration. 6) The rate of lever pressing response in the lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation test in the Skinner box was markedly increased by rectal administration of 0.2 mg/kg bromazepam. 7) Methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity of mice was significantly suppressed only by bromazepam administered rectally in a dose of 5 mg/kg. 8) The falling effect of bromazepam on body temperature in normal rats was the same in both administration routes and was dose-dependent. From these data, significant differences of the pharmacological effects between oral and rectal administration of bromazepam were recognized in the duration of action and, in part, potencies; and therefore, rectal administration of bromazepam may be a useful dosage form for clinical use.", 
    "51": "Five healthy male volunteers received single oral doses of 10 mg diazepam, 20 mg temazepam and placebo, in a double-blind, randomised fashion. Smooth pursuit eye movement velocity and serum benzodiazepine concentration were measured before and after at 0.5,1,1.5,2,3,4,6,9 and 12 h after administration of the treatments. Significant decrease in smooth pursuit eye movement velocity as compared to placebo was observed between 0.5-2 h after temazepam, and between 1-2 h after diazepam. Smooth pursuit eye movement velocity was log-linearly correlated with serum temazepam and diazepam concentration. The results demonstrate the relationship between serum benzodiazepine concentration and its effect on an objective measure of oculomotor performance.", 
    "52": "Forty-three outpatients with \"midwinter insomnia\" (an early type insomnia commonly seen north of the Polar Circle when the sun stays below the horizon) were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups, receiving either 15 mg midazolam, 1 mg flunitrazepam, or placebo, for 5 nights, double blind, after 3 nights without drug. In all three groups, this was followed by 5 nights on placebo (single blind). Several subjective sleep variables were recorded every morning, some variables also at noon. Placebo had practically no effect on any sleep variable, whereas both active drugs markedly improved sleep with regard to the following variables: sleep latency, number of awakenings, total duration of sleep, quality of sleep, total evaluation of sleep, and feelings of drowsiness in the morning and at noon. In the withdrawal period, patients who had received active drug showed a deterioration of sleep on most variables, but not beyond the baseline level. A true \"rebound insomnia\" could thus not be demonstrated. There was no significant difference in any of the variables between midazolam and flunitrazepam treatment. Side effects were reported by very few patients. Midazolam seems to be as effective as flunitrazepam in this type of insomnia, in spite of its much shorter biological half-life.", 
    "53": "Single dose pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of intravenous and intramuscular lorazepam were investigated in 6 younger healthy human volunteers of either sex. The plasma concentration profile after intravenously administered lorazepam could in all cases be fitted by NONLIN to a biexponential function of time with a mean terminal (biological) half-life of 14.10 hrs +/- 2.94 S.D. (range 9.68 - 18.42 hrs). The mean half-life of the initial alpha-phase of distribution was 0.31 hrs +/- 0.11 S.D. The mean apparent volume of distribution derived from AUC, Vd-area (=Vd beta), was 1.24 1 kg-1 +/- 0.17 S.D. Mean plasma clearance of the drug was 62.17 ml kg-1 hr-1 +/- 8.85 S.D. The apparent central volume of distribution characterizing the open two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was 0.59 1 kg-1 +/- 0.19 S.D. After intramuscular administration to the same subjects the plasma concentration time lapse could be described by either tri- or bi-exponential kinetics, which are representative of open two- and one-compartment models with absorption phases, respectively. Mean biological half-life was 14.01 hrs +/- 2.31 S.D. and Vd-area 1.24 l kg-1 +/- 0.14 S.D., both values in full agreement with the findings based on intravenous administration. Half-life of the absorption phase varied from 0.08 to 1.76 hrs. Mean systemic availability of the drug was 88.8% +/- 8.3 S.D. The inattention effect of lorazepam was assessed by exposing the subjects during the intravenous pharmacokinetic experiments to a binaural stimulation test, which revealed various degrees of acute reduced attention in only three of the subjects.", 
    "54": "In addition to anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, benzodiazepines (BDZ) produce sedation, ataxia, and muscular relaxation. In general, it was difficult to separate these properties within this chemical class during the search for clinically useful anxiolytics; and when BDZ's were used to characterize 3H-BDZ binding sites they indicated only a single homogenous class of receptors. A new chemical series was discovered, triazolopyridazines (TPZ, prototype CL 218,872), which showed anticonflict activity in rats and monkeys without sedation or ataxia and inhibited 3H-BDZ binding in brain membranes with kinetic characteristics suggesting the presence of multiple BDZ receptors. High affinity and low affinity sites for the TPZ were demonstrated, the former designated at Type 1 and the latter as Type 2. Anatomical and in vivo studies have supported different distributions of each receptor in brain. Lately, the physical separation of discrete proteins which bind 3H-BDZ has been reported. The multiple receptors and the variety of endogenous substances which have been proposed as modulators and ligands of the receptors might explain variability as well as selectivity in pharmacological properties in these drugs.", 
    "55": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) were assessed in a holeboard by the reductions in head-dipping, rearing and locomotor activity; the correlations among all these measures were significant. Test-retest correlations were significant for all but the time spent head-dipping. On the basis of their behavioral responses to chlordiazepoxide six \"strong\" and six \"weak\" responders were identified and used for an in vitro electrophysiological study. There were no differences between the two groups in the extent to which flurazepam potentiated muscimol, but picrotoxin showed a greater antagonism of muscimol in slices from \"strong\" responders and flurazepam showed a greater reduction of picrotoxin potency. There was a significant correlation between the in vitro picrotoxin shift and the chlordiazepoxide-induced reduction in locomotor activity. The correlations between behavioral responses to chlordiazepoxide and the plasma benzodiazepine concentrations were low and only one (for locomotor activity) reached significance.", 
    "56": "A retrospective analysis of five studies using benzodiazepines and one using a benzodiazepine-like drug, zopiclone, and involving 61 subjects in toto was carried out. All used a placebo control and all acute studies incorporated pre-treatment values as well. Eight variables which have previously been shown to be sensitive to benzodiazepine action and which covered a range of physiological, psychological and subjective measures were chosen. Within-subject correlations between drug minus placebo values for these variables were computed to examine relationships between the measures while the subjects were taking benzodiazepines. It was found that closely related measures within system were significantly correlated but other correlations were sparse. However under limited conditions, i.e., several doses of one drug in the same subjects as in the zopiclone study, a consistent pattern of effects was shown across measures, resulting in half of the possible correlations showing statistical significance. A similar pattern was shown in patients after 2-4 weeks treatment with benzodiazepines.", 
    "57": "The effects of three quinoline derivatives, PK 8165 07.5 mg/kg). PK 9084 (7.5 mg/kg) and CGS 8216 (1 and 10 mg/kg), alone and in combination with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg), were investigated in the social interaction test of anxiety. PK 8165 had no effect on social interaction but both PK 8165 and PK 9084 in combination with chlordiazepoxide produced sedation. PK 9084 exhibited a partial anxiolytic profile reflected by a drug x light interaction in the familiar test conditions. CGS 8216 (1 mg/kg) showed no significant effects on social interaction, but did counteract the sedative effect of chlordiazepoxide. The 10 mg/kg dose of CGS 8216 reduced social interaction between pairs of animals in familiar test conditions which is indicative of an anxiogenic effect. These intrinsic anxiogenic properties of CGS 8216 demonstrate that it cannot be considered an inert benzodiazepine antagonist.", 
    "58": "1--The longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus strip preparation of the guinea-pig ileum was used to study the binding of [3H]-diazepam and the effect of benzodiazepines on its contraction. 2--Scatchard analysis of binding indicated a single class of binding sites with KD = 43 nM and Bmax = 229 fmol/mg pr\u00f3tein. Binding was of peripheral type based on the much greater binding affinity of Ro5-4864 as compared to clonazepam. Binding of [3H]-diazepam reached equilibrium at 10 min and dissociated rapidly (T1/2 = 1.3 min). The KD derived from the rate constants agreed with that from the Scatchard analysis. 3--Benzodiazepines produced a dose-dependent decrease in the electrically induced contractions of the longitudinal muscle strip, but their potencies in this effect did not correlate with their binding affinities. 4--Diazepam antagonized the contractions of the longitudinal muscle strip induced by K+, Ca2+, histamine and carbachol. The inhibition of Ca2+-induced contractions was reversed by increasing the concentration of Ca2+ in the medium.", 
    "59": "In a 4-week double-blind study of 53 psychoneurotic outpatients, alprazolam and lorazepam appeared to be equally safe and effective in relieving anxiety symptoms. The only statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups were in autonomic symptoms at week 1 and in dizziness at week 4. In both cases, the scores favored patients taking alprazolam. Drowsiness and lightheadedness were the most frequent side effects.", 
    "60": "The literature on cimetidine drug interactions has been thoroughly reviewed. Several different mechanisms have been proposed for cimetidine-related drug interactions. These mechanisms include: (1) impaired hepatic drug metabolism due to inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, (2) reduced hepatic blood flow, resulting in decreased clearance of drugs that are highly extracted by the liver, (3) increased potential for myelosuppression when administered concurrently with other drugs capable of causing myelosuppression, and (4) altered bioavailability of acid-labile drugs. Cimetidine binds reversibly to the hepatic cytochrome P-450 and P-448 systems, resulting in decreased metabolism of drugs that undergo Phase I reactions (e.g., dealkylation and hydroxylation). In contrast, glucuronidation pathways are unaffected. The rapid onset and reversal of cimetidine's inhibition of hepatic metabolism indicates an effect on hepatic enzyme systems. Cimetidine also has been reported to decrease hepatic blood flow. Drugs that are highly extracted by the liver, such as propranolol, lidocaine, and morphine, may be postulated to have a decreased hepatic clearance. Cimetidine, through its effect on gastric pH, may increase the absorption of acid-labile drugs or may decrease the absorption of drugs. There have been reports of increased potential for myelosuppression when cimetidine is administered concurrently with drugs capable of causing bone marrow suppression. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in cimetidine drug interactions allows the clinician to prevent and predict these interactions.", 
    "61": "Thyroid hormones and their derivatives were found to inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding stereospecifically and in a monophasic manner. Among the compounds tested, D-thyroxine was the most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.5 microM). The naturally occurring L-thyroxine was about 40-fold less potent (IC50 = 20 microM). The structure-activity relationships seem to imply that the thyronine base has the principal role in the inhibition of benzodiazepine receptor binding. The type of inhibition was examined with the most potent inhibitor, D-thyroxine, by Scatchard analysis. The apparent dissociation constant (KD) of the [3H]flunitrazepam binding increased and the receptor density (Bmax) decreased as a function of D-thyroxine concentration; this is characteristic of mixed-type inhibition.", 
    "62": "The lever-pressing of rats was reinforced with food according to a variable-interval 1-min schedule. In one group, occasional illumination of cue lights for 30-sec periods was followed by a brief electric shock; responding was suppressed during these periods. Naloxone (0.01-10 mg/kg) did not change the degree to which responding was suppressed during the pre-shock stimulus. Diprenorphine (0.1-10 mg/kg) slightly attenuated suppression, and diazepam (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) increased responding during the stimulus to normal levels. These results confirm that opiate antagonists do not always enhance the effects of shock on behavior. In a second group, occasional illumination of the cue lights for 20-sec periods was followed by delivery of free food pellets. Responding was also suppressed during the pre-food stimulus. Neither naloxone nor diprenorphine had any effect on response rate during this stimulus. In contrast to the results of earlier studies using benzodiazepines, diazepam (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) produced a marked attenuation of response suppression during the pre-food stimulus.", 
    "63": "Ro 5-4864, a selective ligand for the benzodiazepine micromolar and peripheral receptors, had a significant dose-related (5-20 mg/kg) anxiogenic action in the social interaction test of anxiety. This anxiogenic effect was reversed by phenytoin (10 mg/kg), a ligand for the micromolar receptors, but unaffected by the isoquinoline PK 11195 (10 mg/kg), a ligand for the peripheral receptors.", 
    "64": "Irreversible attachment of flunitrazepam to brain membranes occurs on exposure to UV light, resulting in a loss of the number of binding sites detected by saturation binding of [3H]flunitrazepam, but not of [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE). Changes in the affinity of ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor produced by photoaffinity labelling, as indicated by the relative IC50 values for the displacement of [3H]beta CCE in photoaffinity labelled versus control membranes, appear to be related to their chemical structure rather than to their pharmacological profile.", 
    "65": "Satiated rats could be trained to give stable rates of responding for rewarding stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus delivered on differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) schedule requiring 2 to 8 sec interresponse intervals for reinforcement (DRL-2 to 8). The performance on a DRL-8 schedule was tested 30 min after the oral administration of benzodiazepines. Diazepam (5 and 10 mg/kg) and meprobamate (200 mg/kg) caused significant increases in response rates during the first 5 min of a session, but not thereafter. Bromazepam (1 and 5 mg/kg) also caused a significant increase in the rates during the first and second 5 min. On the other hand, chlorpromazine (20 mg/kg) caused no effect in the first 5 min but decrease in second and third 5 min. These results indicate that DRL schedules with a brain stimulation reward provided a useful tool for evaluation of antianxiety drugs. The advantage of the brain stimulation reward over food reward is that the possible effects of the drugs on hunger motivation need not be considered.", 
    "66": "Uptake of [3H]adenosine into rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes was studied. Hexobendine (10(-5) M) and the benzodiazepine agonists diazepam (10(-5) M) and flurazepam (10(-4) M) significantly inhibited this uptake, but only if the compounds were pre-incubated for 10 min in the case of the benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepine antagonists Ro15-1788 (10(-5) M) and CGS 8216 (10(-5) M) failed to reverse the action of benzodiazepine agonists or hexobendine on [3H]adenosine uptake. The results add weight to the view that inhibition of adenosine uptake processes by benzodiazepines do not contribute to their behavioural effects.", 
    "67": "The potency and site of action of Ro5-3663 as a GABA antagonist were investigated in the rat cuneate slice in vitro. A Schild plot for Ro5-3663 was clearly non-linear but enabled a pA2 value of 3.97 to be calculated. Combination studies using the 'classical' GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin indicated that Ro5-3663 acted at a separate site from bicuculline, but may share a common site with picrotoxin.", 
    "68": "The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline, which blocks several of the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines, induces a dose-dependent increase in sleep latency in the rat. Furthermore, at a low dose that by itself does not affect sleep, 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline blocks sleep induction by a large dose of flurazepam. The benzodiazepine receptor may play a role in both the physiological regulation and pharmacological induction of sleep.", 
    "69": "The site-specific binding of the potent nucleoside transport inhibitor, [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine ([3H]NBMPR), to guinea pig cardiac membranes was rapid, reversible and saturable. [3H]NBMPR bound with high affinity to a single class of sites at which the KD was 0.23 +/- 0.07 nM and which had a Bmax of 1700 +/- 290 fmol/mg protein. Several recognized nucleoside transport inhibitors and benzodiazepines inhibited the binding of [3H]NBMPR with an order of potency similar to that observed for the inhibition of the binding of [3H]NBMPR to human erythrocytes and guinea pig synaptosomes.", 
    "70": "[3H]Muscimol was irreversibly incorporated into rat cerebellar membranes upon irradiation with ultraviolet light. GABA agonists and antagonists inhibited this incorporation. The reversible muscimol-binding decreased after photoaffinity-labeling of the membranes with muscimol. These results indicated that this irreversible incorporation is to the GABA receptor. Photolabeled GABA receptor protein showed its Mr of 50000 +/- 1000 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This molecular size is identical to that of the benzodiazepine receptor which was photolabeled with 3H-flunitrazepam.", 
    "71": "CGS 7525A, a new tetracyclic compound, was evaluated for alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonism in receptor binding assays and in behavioral and electrophysiological tests. 3H-Clonidine, but not 3H-prazosin, binding was potently inhibited in vitro by CGS 7525A. In vivo, CGS 7525A attenuated the suppressant action of clonidine on phenylquinone-induced writhing and on locus coeruleus neuronal firing rate. Mianserin was nearly equipotent with CGS 7525A in the 3H-clonidine binding assay, but considerably less potent in the measures of alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonism in vivo. Both CGS 7525A and mianserin displaced 3H-spiroperidol binding from frontal cortex 5-HT2 binding sites. Although yohimbine resembled CGS 7525A in most respects, its activity at 5-HT2 binding sites was relatively low, CGS 7525A was not associated with any appreciable blockade of norepinephrine or serotonin uptake in vitro. Thus, CGS 7525A appears to be a promising new pharmacological tool for investigating the behavioral function of brain alpha 2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "72": "Rats were given a flurazepam solution as their only water source for 4 weeks. The drug concentration was adjusted so the rats would consume 100-150 mg/kg daily. This treatment is known to cause a reduction in the number of specific benzodiazepine binding sites (receptor down-regulation) and tolerance to the locomotor impairment caused by the injection of a large test dose of flurazepam. Both the tolerance and the receptor down-regulation disappear within 24 hours after the end of chronic treatment. After 4 weeks of flurazepam treatment, rats were tested for locomotor impairment and loss of the righting response caused by pentobarbital, ethanol or diazepam. There was a small tolerance to pentobarbital. This lasted at least 4 days, but had disappeared by 7 days. Rats also had a small tolerance to ethanol, which disappeared between 24 and 48 hours after the end of chronic flurazepam treatment. In contrast, there was a large tolerance to diazepam, but this was gone by 24 hours after the end of chronic treatment. It appears that two types of tolerance develop during benzodiazepine treatment: (1) tolerance specific for benzodiazepines possibly mediated by receptor down-regulation, and (2) nonspecific tolerance, possibly analogous to that which develops during chronic barbiturate treatment.", 
    "73": "A parasagittal slice of the frog spinal cord was kept in vitro for electrophysiological recordings from dorsal and ventral roots. Low concentrations of caffeine (50 microM) which had relatively small effects on baseline electrical activity, increased the depolarizing action of GABA on dorsal root fibres by 50%. A similar result was also obtained when GABA motoneuronal responses were tested. On dorsal roots the potentiation of GABA responses by caffeine was reflected by a significant decrease in GABA ED50 value without change in the maximal response amplitude; this enhancing action of caffeine was not blocked by bicuculline (5 microM) but was abolished by flurazepam (5 microM) or by Ca2+ antagonists (Mn2+ and Cd2+). Blockade of interneuronal activity by procaine left the potentiating action of caffeine unchanged. High doses of caffeine (up to 1 mM) produced a seemingly non-competitive antagonism of GABA responses. We suggest that caffeine can modulate GABA responses through two different mechanisms: a potentiation of GABA effects (seen with low doses of caffeine) probably due to Ca2+ mobilization and an antagonism of GABA responses (typically seen with large doses of caffeine) perhaps caused by block of GABA receptor-activated channels. This novel caffeine-GABA interaction may be useful to interpret some of the effects of caffeine on mammalian behaviour.", 
    "74": "Following chronic exposure of C57/BL6 mice to ethanol the binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 and [3H]propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate to benzodiazepine binding sites in the brain was studied. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites were measured using the probe [3H]Ro5-4864. Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in a significant increase in [3H]Ro5-4864 binding due to a 43% increase in receptor density. The affinity of [3H]Ro5-4864 for the receptor was not significantly affected. The binding of [3H]propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate to central-type benzodiazepine receptors was not affected by chronic ethanol treatment."
