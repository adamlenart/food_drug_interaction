    "0": "The human and rat genes for a fifth muscarinic receptor have been cloned and expressed in mammalian cells. The 532 amino acid human protein has 89% sequence identity to the 531 amino acid rat protein and is most closely related to the m3 receptor. Both proteins are encoded by single exons. The receptor has intermediate affinity for pirenzepine and low affinity for AF-DX 116, and it increases metabolism of phosphatidylinositol when stimulated with carbachol. Expression of mRNA has yet to be observed in brain or selected peripheral tissues, suggesting that either it is substantially less abundant than m1-m4 or its distribution is quite different.", 
    "1": "1. The effects of acute and 8-day administration of diazepam (DZP) on the acute toxicity of bupivacaine in the mouse were studied. 2. Protection of bupivacaine-induced acute toxicity by DZP appears to be dose-dependent after treatment for 8 days but not after acute treatment.", 
    "2": "Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine used for anesthetic induction. Its effects on the cerebral circulation are still controversial. We evaluated the effects of midazolam on the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral vascular resistance (CVR), and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in dogs (n = 6) using the cerebral venous outflow method. CVR was calculated as the quotient of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CBF, CMRO2 was obtained from the measurements of CBF and arterio-venous O2 difference (A-V dO2). Midazolam was administered in sequential i.v. doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg by bolus injection with an interval of 20 min. This agent significantly reduced the MAP, CBF and CMRO2, but did not affect the CVR. The maximal decreases in MAP, CBF, and CMRO2 from the control levels averaged 14.8%, 12.2%, and 9.3%, respectively, by 0.5 mg/kg; 18.9% 18.6% and 12.1% by 1.0 mg/kg; and 23.6%, 18.7% and 16.1% by 2.0 mg/kg. Although the increments in doses further depressed that MAP, CBF and CMRO2, the dose-dependent effects were slight. Only the values of reduction in CMRO2 were significantly different between the doses of 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg. Therefore, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg produced nearly the maximal effects. The results indicate that midazolam causes a mild reduction (10-25%) in arterial pressure, brain perfusion and cerebral oxygenation. Cerebral vascular resistance is not significantly changed.", 
    "3": "In the present study we set out to explain the complex atropine dose-response curves in man in relation to M-cholinoceptor subtype occupancy. In healthy volunteers the effects of atropine on heart rate and salivary flow were quantified. M-cholinoceptor subtype occupancy by antagonist present in plasma samples was detected in an in vitro radioreceptor assay. Atropine effects were studied without and after propranolol (240 mg oral dose) and without and after pirenzepine (1.1 mg i.v.) to differentiate beta-adrenoceptor and M-cholinoceptor subtype mediated effects. 1. In receptor binding studies, M-cholinoceptors in bovine cerebral cortex membranes were labelled with 3H-pirenzepine (pKd = 8.05), M-cholinoceptors in rat salivary gland membranes with 3H-N-methylscopolamine (pKd = 9.02). Atropine competed for binding of these ligands with a small (2.1-fold) preferential selectivity via the cerebral in comparison to the glandular receptors (pKi = 9.18 versus 8.86). Pirenzepine showed a marked selectivity (40-fold) in this respect with pKi-values of 8.05 (M1: cerebral cortex) and 6.45 (M2: salivary glands). 2. At heart rate and at salivary flow, bivalent dose-response curves of atropine were observed with opposite effect vectors. The typical antagonist effects at M-cholinoceptors (i.e. an increase of heart rate and an inhibition of salivary flow) were observed at doses greater than 1 microgram/kg, whereas \"paradoxical\" cholinomimetic effects of atropine became apparent at lower doses. From a superposition of two isotherms with opposite effect vectors ED50-values were calculated, which were in the range of half-maximal M-cholinoceptor occupancy in the in vitro radioreceptor assay of plasma samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Modulation of the effect of carbachol by epithelium on tracheal smooth muscle of guinea-pig was studied by using coaxial bioassay system. The contractile response of the bioassay organ (epithelium-free tracheal smooth muscle of guinea-pig) to carbachol was well maintained along the observation period of 30 min. When the same bioassay organ was taken into epithelium-intact tracheal tube of guinea-pig, a significant relaxation followed the carbachol-induced initial contraction within 30 min which was abolished by the removal of epithelial cell layer. Epithelium-dependent relaxation with carbachol is not due to stimulation of M1-muscarinic receptors. The results indicate that airway epithelium has a role in the termination of carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction.", 
    "5": "The effects of oral administration of two doses of ethanol (0.75 and 1.5 g/kg) and a single dose of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) on electrophysiological responses to an event related potential (ERP) paradigm were investigated in the squirrel monkey Saimiri Sciureus. A passive auditory \"oddball plus novel\" tone sequence was utilized to elicit N1, P2, N2, and P3-like components which resembled waveforms obtained from human subjects under the same conditions. Ethanol at both doses was found to produce a significant decrease in the amplitude of the N1 component. The higher ethanol dose also produced a significant decrease in the amplitude of the P3-like component. Ethanol at both doses was observed to produce significant increases in the variability of the amplitude of these components as measured from trial to trial. Diazepam, like ethanol, also induced a significant decrease in the N1 component of the ERP but did not affect the later waves. These results suggest that ERPs can reliably assess the electrophysiological actions of ethanol in monkeys.", 
    "6": "Two animal tests of anxiety (the elevated plus-maze and the social interaction test) were used to investigate the effects of several antipanic agents. In the elevated plus-maze, the triazolobenzodiazepines adinazolam (2 and 5 mg/kg) and alprazolam (1 mg/kg), tested after 5 days of pretreatment, demonstrated significant anxiolytic effects, while phenelzine (9 mg/kg), after 21 days of pretreatment, demonstrated nonsignificant anxiolytic effects. In the social interaction test, the triazolobenzodiazepines generally did not produce an anxiolytic profile, and phenelzine even revealed significant anxiogenic activity. The antipanic agents therefore distinguish between the two tests of anxiety. The lack of a strong anxiolytic profile with these agents in both tests lends support to the distinction between generalized anxiety and panic disorder.", 
    "7": "To study the role played by opiate mechanisms in the tolerance to the anorectic effects of amphetamines, the influence of chronic treatment with d,1-amphetamine (AMPH) on the effects of the selective kappa opiate agonist U50488H (U50), of morphine (MORPH) and of diazepam (DZP) on food and water intake was evaluated in rats. Since diuresis is selectively enhanced by kappa agonists, its sensitivity to chronic AMPH was also evaluated. On the first day of AMPH treatment the feeding response to U50 was depressed. On day 9, when tolerance to the anorectic effects of AMPH had developed, this response was enhanced and prolonged. U50-mediated diuresis was not increased in the AMPH group. AMPH however produced diuresis by itself and this effect may be responsible for the increased water intake that developed during chronic treatment. The administration of MORPH (on day 17), but not of DZP (on day 13), produced a similar pattern of response. Interruption of AMPH treatment brought about a slow normalization of response to U50, that appeared to be completed after 17 days. An increase in feeding response to U50 was also obtained after 14 days of cathinone administration, confirming the amphetamine-like properties of this drug. In order to evaluate the possibility that preventing sensitization of opiate mechanisms could also prevent tolerance to anorectic effects of AMPH, we chronically administered MORPH in combination with AMPH, obtaining a further reduction of feeding and an apparent slowing in tolerance development. However, such a reduction was also obtained acutely, although MORPH alone produced feeding stimulation. We suggest that opiates may both activate and inhibit feeding and that AMPH inhibits the activatory branch and works synergically with the inhibitory branch. The prolonged inhibition of the activatory branch causes its compensatory hypertrophy resulting in hypersensitivity to exogenous opiates.", 
    "8": "The effects of RO 15-4513, RO 15-3505 and FG 7142 on the anxiolytic properties of ethanol in mice were investigated using the plus-maze test of anxiety. Before being tested on the plus-maze, the mice were tested in a holeboard apparatus. All three inverse agonists attenuated the reduction in exploration caused by ethanol in the holeboard test. In the plus-maze, only RO 15-4513 and FG 7142, which possess anxiogenic properties when administered alone, attenuated ethanol's anxiolytic effect. RO 15-3505, which alone had no effect on anxiety, failed to significantly reduce ethanol's anxiolytic effect. Neither RO 15-4513 nor FG 7142 reduced the increase in the total number of arm entries caused by ethanol. These data indicate that the interaction between ethanol and benzodiazepine receptor ligands depends both on the intrinsic properties of the ligands and the behavior under investigation.", 
    "9": "The metabolism of thyroxine (T4) by cultures of embryonic-rat brain cells grown in a chemically defined medium was studied. Cells in these cultures were predominantly neurons, characterized by the developmental increase of the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the high-affinity (0.67 nM) benzodiazepine neuronal receptors. The cultures also contained astrocytes, characterized by immunological studies using an anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and by the increase in glutamine synthetase (GS). Incubation of the cells, in situ, with 125I-labelled 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) showed the presence of a single class of high-affinity nuclear receptors for T3 with a maximal binding capacity of 270-470 fmol T3/mg DNA and a Kd of 63 +/- 13 pM. Cells incubated in situ with 50 pM [125I]T4 actively metabolized the hormone. The major metabolite, 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) (159 +/- 43 fmol/4 h/mg DNA), was almost completely released into the medium. T3 was a minor metabolite (77 +/- 3 fmol/4 h/mg DNA), 75% of which accumulated in the cells. Of this T3, 35% was bound to the nuclear receptors after 4 h of incubation. In vitro assays showed that the 5'-deiodinase activity increased during culture and the 5-deiodinase decreased slightly. Cytosine-arabinoside (ARAc) treatment of the cultures reduced the DNA content per culture dish, corresponding to a fall in the number of GFAp-positive cells (astrocytes) and to a decrease in GS. A small increase in the number of benzodiazepine sites was observed. ARAc treatment markedly reduced the T3 production (14.5 +/- 0.7 fmol/4 h/mg DNA) and did not change the rT3 production. We suggest that T4 is metabolized to T3 in astrocytes, taken up by neurons and binds to their nuclear receptors.", 
    "10": "Twenty-one children undergoing surgery received a caudal block using 1 ml kg-1 of a mixture of 50% lignocaine (1%) and 50% bupivacaine (0.25%). They were randomized into two groups, one of which received diazepam 10 mg rectally as premedication. Diazepam administration resulted in significantly higher Cmax and AUC values for bupivacaine but did not influence the plasma concentrations of lignocaine.", 
    "11": "The pharmacokinetics of lorazepam premedication were studied in 16 patients using two different formulations (intravenous and FDDF oral administrations). Arterial blood samples were taken at intervals for up to 600 min after administration of 4 mg of each formulation, and plasma lorazepam concentrations were determined by gas-chromatography with electron capture detection. Concentration-time data for individual subjects were analysed by model-independent methods. The derived pharmacokinetic parameters indicated a rapid distribution (median T1/2 lambda 1 i.v. = 15.2 min, median T1/2 lambda 1 oral = 31.6 min) into a steady-state volume of distribution approximating total body water, with a long elimination half-life and a low clearance. Vdss and clearance were similar with both treatments. The absorption of FDDF lorazepam was rapid in half of the patients and provided a high plasma concentration of lorazepam (Cmax = 61.8 ng ml-1) in a short time interval (Tmax = 58 min), but there were considerable inter-individual differences. This variability in absorption might explain why premedication with FDDF lorazepam is sometimes less effective than expected.", 
    "12": "Seven cases of convulsive seizure occurring after abrupt withdrawal of Lorazepam in non epileptic patients are reported. Five ot of them had an important cerebral damage occurred in perinatal period. All patients, before withdrawal, had been taking Lorazepam, 5-15 mg/day, for at least six months. It is stressed that in similar cases there is no need to start an anticonvulsive therapy because usually there is not a spontaneous recurrence of convulsive seizures. It is suggested that withdrawal of long term treatments with high doses of benzodiazepines be accomplished carefully and very slowly especially in patients with a previous cerebral damage.", 
    "13": "In chronic experiments on female rabbits it was shown that GABA-receptor agonist phenibut given in small doses exerts the stimulating effect, while GABA and phenibut administered in large doses suppress the uterine contractile activity, acting probably as modulators of presynaptic release of neuromediators. Diazepam displays the regulatory effect on the uterine contractions via the postsynaptic receptor mechanisms. The data suggest the involvement of the GABAergic mechanisms in the uterine contractile function.", 
    "14": "A comparative study of antimonoamine oxidase activity of psychotropic agents of different classes was made. Phenothiazine, butyrophenone and atypical neuroleptics were found to suppress deamination of 2-phenylethylamine in the brain. Tranquilizers of benzodiazepine structure appeared to be inactive with respect to monoamine oxidase (MAO) of the brain. Anticonvulsants (except difenin) weakly inhibit serotonin deamination and, on the contrary, difenin stimulates serotonin- and 2-phenylethylamine deamination. Antidepressants--MAO inhibitors--more actively reduce the rate of serotonin deamination, and tricyclic antidepressant desimipramine is similar to aminazine by its effect on MAO. Phenamine is a potent MAO inhibitor. The effect of cocaine is significantly less pronounced.", 
    "15": "Studies with the atypical muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine provide convincing evidence for the classification of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) into two subtypes, M1 and M2. The present study examines the heterogeneity of the M2 subtype employing the newly developed competitive muscarinic antagonist, AFDX-116. Comparison of the binding affinities of pirenzepine, atropine, and AFDX-116 to mAChRs in microsomes from the rabbit cerebral cortex, heart, and iris smooth muscle shows that iris mAChRs, which are pharmacologically of the M2 subtype, can be distinguished from M2 cardiac receptors based on their affinity for AFDX-116. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the M2 receptor subtype consists of a heterogeneous population of receptors.", 
    "16": "Midazolam, a water soluble bensodiasepine, has proven to induce a sleep pattern and amnesic effect that makes it preferable for use as a premedication for outpatient surgery. Used in addition to the regular anesthesia, Midazolam obviates the ineffectiveness of the analgesic drug. Since 1970, neuroleptic analgesia has been used as a method of outpatient anesthesia. Unfortunately, neuroleptic analgesia has provided inadequate coverage of pain relief causing pain and discomfort to patients. When a sedation and anxiolytic premedication are used, the patient acceptance increases. In a study in Ramathibodi hospital, Bangkok, Thailand effectiveness of midazolam as a premedication drug in laparoscopic interval sterilization, 150 women capable of reproduction and who were schelduled for the operation were studied. All of the women received 15mg midazolam orally either 60 or 90 minutes before the operation. The women were divided into 3 groups of 50 classified by the type of analgesic administered (tramadol or pethidine). Heart and respiratory rates and blood pressure were measured prior to, during, and after the operation. No difference in the rate of amnesia was found among the 3 groups, and a rate of 36% of amnesia was found in the study. Those results were lower than earlier reports, possibly due to circumstances at the hospital such as lack of coordination between administration of the medication and timing of the surgery.", 
    "17": "The case of a six-year-old male who died in a hospital while receiving several anticonvulsant drugs is described. Phenytoin, desmethyldiazepam, clobazam (an experimental 1,5 benzodiazepine), and desmethylclobazam were quantitated in serum, liver, and brain tissue by high performance liquid chromatography. Ethosuximide was quantitated by gas chromatography. To our knowledge, this is one of few reports describing tissue concentrations of ethosuximide collected at autopsy and the first report of clobazam/desmethylclobazam tissue distribution in man.", 
    "18": "Anterograde amnesia is often considered to be a beneficial effect of intravenous conscious sedation. The recently introduced benzodiazepine, midazolam, has associated with its administration a significant anterograde amnesic period. In the case presented here, a healthy young female presented for third molar extraction under midazolam conscious sedation and local anesthesia. After uncomplicated removal of the teeth and clinically adequate recovery from sedation, it was noted that the patient had swallowed the postsurgical gauze packs. Efforts at recovery of the gauze packs were futile. Follow-up discussion with the patient revealed a complete lack of recall of all events occurring for up to an hour or more after the administration of intravenous midazolam. The need for written and oral postoperative instructions to both the patient and his/her escort is emphasized.", 
    "19": "Sublingual lorazepam (2 to 3 mg) was compared with intramuscular diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) and placebo for sedation during oral surgery under local anesthesia. Sixty patients were randomly allocated into three groups in this double-blind, parallel study. The results from this trial show that sublingually administered lorazepam provided good sedation and anxiolysis. More side-effects, such as giddiness, dizziness, and ptosis, as well as profound and prolonged psychomotor impairment, were, however, found in the lorazepam group than in those patients who had received intramuscular diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) or placebo.", 
    "20": "Three placebo-controlled double-blind and crossover trials were carried out to analyze the effects of oral yohimbine (YOH) 0.8 mg/kg on mood and performance in 16 healthy students. Subjective assessments (visual analogue scales, side-effects on questionnaire) and objective measurements (digit symbols, flicker fusion, tapping, heterophoria) were done at baseline, and post treatment. YOH shifted the healthy subjects' mood towards feeling panicked, elevated systolic blood pressure and plasma prolactin concentrations, reduced digit symbol substitution, and induced drowsiness and passiveness. Caffeine (CAF) 10 mg/kg raised plasma cortisol and rendered the subjects slightly panicked. Muzziness, clumsiness, tremor, chills and nausea were common after both YOH and CAF. Diazepam (DZ) 0.3 mg/kg given at 60 min antagonized some effects of CAF but failed to antagonize YOH. Clonidine (CLO) 100 micrograms counteracted YOH effects on blood pressure but less the subjective and hormonal effects. CLO 200 micrograms partly antagonized the pressor, sedative but not the hormonal responses of YOH. DZ counteracted YOH effects on plasma cortisol on panic but not on other subjective measures or plasma prolactin. Since CLO did not abolish YOH-induced prolactin increase, it is suggested that these effects of YOH are mediated not only via adrenergic alpha 2-receptors; other mechanisms made important contributions.", 
    "21": "A 10-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who received intravenous lorazepam for atypical absence status seizures is reported. Tonic seizures occurred immediately and appeared to represent a paradoxical seizure exacerbation. We also review other patients with paradoxical seizure exacerbation by benzodiazepines.", 
    "22": "Twenty-five out of 41 (61%) patients with drug-resistant complex partial seizures showed an initial dramatic response to clobazam. Sixteen of these responders developed tolerance to the effects of clobazam so that only 9 (22%) maintained a dramatic response for 1 year. Factors which appeared important in predicting a dramatic response to treatment were a known aetiology for the epilepsy, the occurrence of complex partial seizures alone (i.e., without secondary generalisation) and the absence of mental retardation.", 
    "23": "1. Morphine uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UDP-GT) was studied in human liver microsomes. The (-)- and (+)-morphine enantiomers were used as substrates and inhibitors, such as oxazepam and various opioid congeners were employed to characterize the different glucuronidation pathways. The kinetics of the oxazepam inhibition were studied in the rat liver. 2. The overall glucuronidation of (+)-morphine was higher than that of (-)-morphine. The morphine congeners tested, potently inhibited the formation of (-)-morphine-3-glucuronide ((-)-M3G), except for normorphine and codeine. The formation of (+)-morphine-6-glucuronide [+)-M6G) was potently inhibited by only dextromethorphan and (+)-naloxone. All drugs except normorphine inhibited the formation of (+)-M3G by 18-50%. 3. The metabolism of (-)-morphine to (-)-M3G was more sensitive to oxazepam inhibition than the formation of (+)-M3G from (+)-morphine in the rat liver. 4. The glucuronidation of natural morphine is subject to in vitro interaction with oxazepam and several opiate drugs. Our study supports the theory of more than one type of UDP-GT being involved in morphine glucuronidation.", 
    "24": "In a randomized, prospective, double-blind trial we investigated the efficacy and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788 in 57 patients undergoing general surgery. Anesthesia was induced and maintained by a combination of Flunitrazepam-Fentanyl-Pancuronium. Inhalation anesthetics were excluded from the study. After reversal of any residual relaxant effect we titrated RO 15-1788 or placebo by repeated i.v. administration of 0.1 mg (= 1.0 ml) up to a maximum dosage of 1.0 mg or to a definite arousal reaction. Before as well as 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection of the trial substance we evaluated efficacy (sedation, comprehension and collaboration, orientation in time and space), presence of anterograde amnesia, side-effects, hemodynamics, and subjective patient assessment by a point scale. RO 15-1788 significantly improved the level of consciousness (P less than 0.005) at a dosage of 0.59 +/- 0.29 mg at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after administration as well as orientation in time and space (P less than 0.005) after 30 min. There was significantly less anterograde amnesia (P less than 0.005) after 15, 30, and 60 min. Symptoms of a benzodiazepine rebound effect after 120 min indicate a short half-life time of RO 15-1788. We did not observe any hemodynamic side effects. Local tolerance was good. Side effects in terms of nausea (1 case), vomiting (4), euphoria or dysphoria (2), benign cardiac arrhythmias (1) or a state of excitation (1) occurred several times after RO 15-1788 as well as after placebo (nausea 2, vomiting 6, muscular tremor 1). Our results indicate the efficacy and safety of RO 15-1788.", 
    "25": "Forty patients, scheduled for elective surgery in a thoracic and vascular surgical unit, were anaesthetized by a total intravenous anaesthesia technique using midazolam and fentanyl. Subsequent reversal of anaesthesia by the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was evaluated in a double-blind trial. The patients were observed in the recovery room postoperatively until the next morning, and their recovery was repeatedly evaluated during the first 240 min after anaesthesia. Six patients in the placebo group required an oral airway or an endotracheal tube during the first hours of recovery, whereas none who received flumazenil did. The respiratory rate was significantly higher after flumazenil than placebo during the first 4 h postoperatively (Anova, P less than 0.01). Blood pressure and heart rate were not different between the two groups. The degree of sedation, orientation in time and space and the ability to cooperate were significantly superior after flumazenil than placebo (Anova, P less than 0.01). Some degree of resedation was observed in both groups, affecting 95% of the patients who received flumazenil against 30% after placebo (Mann-Whitney, P less than 0.05). No adverse reactions attributable to the use of flumazenil were encountered.", 
    "26": "The effect of anaesthesia on the hyperglycaemic and adrenocortical response induced by surgery was studied in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. The study group was anaesthetized with midazolam and alfentanil using a totally intravenous anaesthetic technique. A reference group received anaesthesia with thiopentone, alfentanil and nitrous oxide. Midazolam 0.42 mg.kg-1 was given as a loading infusion followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.125 mg.kg-1.h-1. Alfentanil was given as a bolus dose of 0.075 mg.kg-1 in both groups, followed by a loading infusion of 0.3 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 15 min and a maintenance infusion of 0.065 mg.kg-1.h-1. Increments of alfentanil were given whenever heart rate or systolic blood pressure exceeded pre-induction values by more than 10%. During anaesthesia mean arterial pressure and heart rate were similar in both groups and there was no difference in alfentanil requirement. An immediate increase in blood glucose concentrations was seen following incision, but maximum concentrations were measured in the early postoperative period. Serum cortisol concentrations decreased after induction of anaesthesia. During surgery they returned to pre-induction values, and in the postoperative period they increased to about twice the pre-induction values. It is concluded that midazolam/alfentanil anaesthesia is as effective as anaesthesia induced by thiopentone, alfentanil and nitrous oxide in suppressing the stress-response to surgery until the postoperative period. No signs of prolonged adrenocortical depression were observed.", 
    "27": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated Cl- influx was studied in rat brain \"microsacs.\" Midazolam caused a shift to the left of the GABA log dose-response curve. Pentobarbital produced a similar shift plus an increase in maximum response. Diazepam, flurazepam and desalkylflurazepam also enhanced GABA-gated Cl- flux. Their effects were blocked by Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist. Acute diazepam pretreatment caused a shift to the left of the GABA dose-response curve but had no effect on the ability of benzodiazepines or pentobarbital to increase GABA-gated Cl- influx. In rats made tolerant by 4 weeks of flurazepam treatment, there was no decrease in the ability of GABA to mediate Cl- flux. GABA was more potent in microsacs from nonwithdrawn rats. In rats withdrawn for 12 but not 48 hr, the maximum GABA response was increased. The ability of benzodiazepines and of pentobarbital to enhance GABA-gated Cl- influx was reduced, showing tolerance. However, 2 days after withdrawal from chronic treatment, this was no longer statistically significant. The results show that benzodiazepine tolerance involves reduced functional coupling between the benzodiazepine recognition site and the GABA recognition site-Cl- channel. Furthermore, reduced effectiveness of GABAA agonists in benzodiazepine-tolerant animals might result from alterations in neuronal activity that occur subsequently to activation of the GABA receptor-gated anion channel.", 
    "28": "Contrary to the belief that the RBC is not metabolically active towards pharmacologically active endogenous and exogenous substances, it is evident that the RBC contains moderate cytochrome P-450-like activity, in addition to the ability to catalyse various other transformations of a range of drugs. The list of drugs for which there is evidence of metabolism by RBC (Table 1) contains examples from several drug classes. However some major classes of drugs which are principally cleared in vivo by metabolism are missing (for example, benzodiazepines). Moreover, there is as yet no evidence for the RBC having the capacity for the more important drug conjugation reactions (glucuronidation, sulphation) although there is evidence of other conjugation reactions (methylation, acetylation, glutathione conjugation). It is conceivable that the RBC could be used as a convenient tissue to add to other metabolism screening procedures used in drug development. Already use has been made of the RBC in identifying fast and slow acetylators. Others have used RBC to identify a possible sex-based difference in drug metabolism. Hopefully, this review has stimulated interest in the ability of the RBC to metabolize drugs and this interest will result in further discoveries.", 
    "29": "Zopiclone 7.5 mg and triazolam 0.50 mg have been compared in a double-blind randomized cross-over sleep laboratory study. After a 6-day placebo, 12 healthy male volunteers aged 20-35 years received 2 active treatment sequences of 6 days separated by a 8-day placebo period and followed by a withdrawal period with placebo for 8 days. 22 polygraphic sleep recordings have been performed. The duration of nocturnal awakenings decreases at the beginning of treatment. Sleep onset latency is significantly decreased as well as the number of awakenings during sleep at the end of treatment. Both drugs improve the sleep efficiency index. Zopiclone increases total sleep time at the beginning and at the end of treatment. Triazolam increases this parameter at the end of the study only. Zopiclone, unlike triazolam increases the duration of deep NREM sleep-stages 3 and 4--at the beginning of treatment. No significant changes in sleep parameters were seen with zopiclone nor triazolam at the end of treatment. In sleep questionnaires, sleep onset latency is shorter under zopiclone than under triazolam and daytime drowsiness is less frequent with zopiclone.", 
    "30": "A simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the direct detection of a broad spectrum of drugs of abuse in hemolyzed whole blood by the enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) is described. A methanolic extract of 1 mL of whole blood is directly analyzed with EMIT urine assays. The proposed method is very sensitive and can detect drug concentrations in low therapeutic to subtherapeutic concentration ranges for all ten assays used. The EMIT urine assays used in this study included those for opiates, amphetamines, methadone, barbiturates, phencyclidine (PCP), methaqualone, propoxyphene, cocaine metabolite, benzodiazepine metabolite, and cannabinoids. This method should be most useful for screening forensic cases by EMIT when no urine is available, such as in impaired driving cases.", 
    "31": "Alprazolam (Xanax) is a relatively new triazolobenzodiazepine which is anxiolytic in man and is also prescribed in the treatment of panic attacks. The objective of this study was to optimize the reactivity of the EMIT tox serum benzodiazepine assay for toxicologic screening of alprazolam. The standard EMIT procedure was extensively modified so that therapeutic concentrations of alprazolam could be detected. Modifications for Methods A and B included a single dilution of specimens, increasing incubation temperature to 37 degrees C, dilution of Reagents A and B, and increasing specimen volume to 100 microL. Method B also included supplementing Reagent A with additional glucose-6-phosphate and beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Using serum standards, the modified EMIT assays have detection limits of approximately 25 ng/mL (Method A) and 20 ng/mL (Method B). The patient specimens analyzed were considered positive by Method B and 24/28 positive by Method A. All 28 patient specimens tested by Method B were confirmed positive by gas chromatography/electron capture detection. The day-to-day precision of both methods was less than 2% CV with diluted EMIT calibrators (N = 6). In conclusion, the modified EMIT assay can be used to screen for alprazolam in serum at therapeutic concentrations.", 
    "32": "Sedation by a combination of an opioid drug such as pentazocine with a benzodiazepine is commonly used for minor surgical and investigative procedures. Nalbuphine is a newer drug which, like pentazocine, is an opioid agonist-antagonist. Its actions are similar, but it has theoretical advantages in its profile of cardiovascular side effects. Nalbuphine or pentazocine in combination with diazepam were compared as components of a sedative technique for invasive radiology. The doses used were in the ratio of 2.5:1--ie nalbuphine 0.2 mg kg-1 and pentazocine 0.5 mg kg-1. Both regimens gave satisfactory results, and no difference could be detected between them in terms of sedation, analgesic efficacy, cardiovascular or respiratory changes, or recovery. Nalbuphine provides a safe and effective alternative to pentazocine in this situation. The study confirmed the need for caution because of the respiratory depressant effects of both drugs.", 
    "33": "Several strikingly different classes of compound bind at the benzodiazepine receptor and exhibit an anxiolytic profile. The conformational preferences of these compounds were ascertained by a variety of techniques. Their electrostatic features were also studied. The combined information has been utilised in the development of a receptor model for the binding site.", 
    "34": "The graph theoretical indices of several compounds with reported benzodiazepine receptor binding affinities were calculated. Our results demonstrate a structural similarity among diazepam, triazolam, and the beta-carboline nucleus and a structural dissimilarity to the purines and nicotinamide. This result correlates with their respective binding affinities. Using the graph theoretical indices as structural descriptors of the benzodiazepines and the significant ligands of the beta-carbolines, a search for peptide sequences as potential ligands was explored. Single amino acids through pentapeptides with all possible amino acid substitutions and chemical modifications were calculated. The peptides generated were subjected to graph theoretical analysis, and their indices were compared to those of the benzodiazepines. Comparisons resulted in seven dipeptides and six tripeptides that are topologically similar to the benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines. The dipeptides are histidine- or tryptophan-containing compounds with pyroglutamine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine residues in the second position. The tripeptides have two aromatic amino acid residues and a pyroglutamine or glycyl terminal residue. These structures are promising candidates because (1) they are structurally (topologically) similar to the benzodiazepines, represented by diazepam and triazolam, and to the beta-carbolines; and (2) they are sequences that may reasonably form a part of a larger peptide or that may be formed metabolically by proteolysis.", 
    "35": "Two 1,4 benzodiazepines bind preferentially to the central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in the brain, clonazepam and Ro 5-4864, respectively. They were administered to rats to determine if the relation between known anxiolytic action and efficacy in augmenting NaCl solution ingestion in rehydrating rats would remain the case for these prototypic agents. Clonazepam (0.062-32.0 mg/kg, PO) was highly potent and efficacious and increased 1.5% NaCl solution intake in a dose-related fashion. Water intake could also be increased, but to a relatively minor degree. Ro 5-4864 (4-8 mg/kg, IP) did not affect 1.5% NaCl solution ingestion, nor did this dose range suppress the augmenting effect of clonazepam (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, PO) on the solution intake. Since clonazepam does, and Ro 5-4864 does not, possess punishment-attenuation properties in other tests, drug augmentation of NaCl solution ingestion by rehydrating rats continues to correlate well with known anxiolytic action.", 
    "36": "Nine cardiac patients treated with digitalis participated in a 3-week study with the aim to investigate whether digoxin (beta-acetyldigoxin) interacts with the new 1,4-benzodiazepine metaclazepam. Comparison of the plasma digoxin levels under placebo and metaclazepam treatment showed no statistically significant differences, i.e. no interactions between digoxin and metaclazepam were found.", 
    "37": "In a double-blind placebo controlled study, 14 male healthy volunteers were examined the morning after they had received an evening dose of 20 mg temazepam (Planum) with regard to functional capacity, cardial, cardiovascular and respiratory regulation as well as neuromuscular excitability and metabolic changes. After being exposed to the bicycle ergometer load, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, glucose and lactate concentration were determined; furthermore the neuromuscular excitability of the musculus vastus medialis, musculus rectus femoris and musculus quadrizeps femoris was estimated. Despite unimportant capacity reductions (p greater than 0.05) concerning the maximum capacity (2.2%) as well as the maximum oxygen uptake (4.3%) under treatment with temazepam, there could not be proved any significant changes regarding cardiopulmonary and metabolic functions. On eastern and western flights, top athletes showed a very fast adaptation to the day-night rhythm without hang-over.", 
    "38": "The effects of diazepam, I-propranolol and isamoltane (CGP 361 A) (I-isopropylamino-3[2-(I-pyrrolyl)-phenoxy]-2-propranol), a drug with beta-receptor blocking and anxiolytic-like properties, on behavioral responses in rats encountering either a novel object or a drinking bottle in an unfamiliar open-field (\"neophobic\" behavior) were evaluated. Diazepam (1-5 mg/kg p.o.) and isamoltane (0.5-1.0 mg/kg p.o.) showed a similar pattern of effects in both test paradigms used. They counteracted the fear-induced suppression of behavioral responses in the presence of novelty: they shortened the approach latencies, increased the exploration-oriented activities and reduced grooming. Propranolol, however, in comparison with isamoltane (1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg i.p.) at equivalent doses, failed to significantly change any of the parameters measured in either of the two test situations. The results therefore indicate that neophobic behavioral responses discriminate between central anxiolytic and peripheral beta-blocking actions of drugs and further validate neophobic behavior as an animal model of anxiety.", 
    "39": "The anxiolytic effect of seduxen was revealed in rats in experimentally modelled anxiety states formed by aversive actions of various biological importance. Phenibut and baclofen were found to display no anxiolytic properties on the anxiety model during a conflict situation. The revealed differences of the anxiolytic effect of derivatives of benzodiazepine and GABA indicate diverse spectra of their psychotropic activity.", 
    "40": "Inkazan and pyrazidol given to mice in certain doses were found to reduce the sedative action of diazepam without decreasing its anxiolytic effect but at the same time enhancing the anticonvulsive one. Imipramine diminishes the hypolocomotor action of diazepam and also its anxiolytic effect and exerts no influence on the anticonvulsive effect. All studied antidepressants diminish the hypnotic action on nitrazepam in mice but only inkazan and pyrazidol decrease the sedative-hypnotic effect of nitrazepam in rats. In connection with the lack of the influence on the anxiolytic effect, inkazan and pyrazidol may be used to decrease the sedative side effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "41": "The efficacy of the benzodiazepine-antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) was evaluated in 26 patients with coma due to benzodiazepine self poisoning, alone or in combination with alcohol or other psychoactive drugs. 77% of the patients responded to the administration of a mean dose of 1.73 mg (range 0.2 to 8 mg) with immediate awakening or an improvement of at least 2 coma grades. In the patients without response (n = 3) or with minor improvement (n = 3) other psychoactive drugs turned out to be predominantly responsible for their comatose state. Adverse effects of flumazenil treatment such as altered blood pressure or increased heart rate were observed, but were generally mild. An acute benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome was seen in 2 cases. In conclusion, flumazenil proved to be effective in the treatment of severe benzodiazepine intoxication. Beyond that, in cases of mixed overdosage or initially unknown diagnosis the antidote assisted in the clarification of the clinical condition.", 
    "42": "This is a report of a consensus conference on the management of the benzodiazepine-dependent patient. While the focus is on patients who are already dependent, it is better to avoid dependence in therapeutic use by careful patient selection, low dose and short term administration. The management of dependence can normally be undertaken in general practice unless there are complicating factors, e.g. concomitant severe medical, psychiatric or social problems. Inpatient management is also preferable for those abusing drugs in the sociorecreational area. Withdrawal should be achieved by gradual dosage reduction over a period of several weeks. Support from the practitioner, family and friends is important to achieve good results. Since postwithdrawal problems occur, good clinician support is necessary over at least the next year. Despite the risk of dependence, it is stressed that benzodiazepines are valuable therapeutic agents for several psychiatric and physical disorders.", 
    "43": "The new hypnotic, 5-[(2-aminoacetamido)methyl]-1-[p-chloro-2-(o- chlorobenzoyl)phenyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride dihydrate (450191-S), is a ring-opened derivative of 1,4-benzodiazepine that is activated by spontaneous cyclization via a labile desglycylated metabolite (191DG). Pharmacokinetic comparison between 450191-S and its primary active metabolite, 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine-2-carboxamide (M-1), in rats revealed that higher levels of active metabolites were produced after 450191-S administration. To find the causes for this, in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed with the focus on hepatic uptake. Study of the absorption and distribution of radioactivity after intraduodenal administration of [14C]450191-S and [14C]M-1 revealed that most of the radioactivity was in the liver, with absorption of M-1 being rapid regardless of the dose and the absorption of 450191-S being slower at higher doses. Comparison of the portal and systemic metabolite levels showed the hepatic first-pass extraction after M-1 administration to be more effective than that after 450191-S administration. This was attributed to the labile intermediate, 191DG, which reduced the first-pass extraction in the liver. This reduction was confirmed by pharmacokinetic analysis after portal injection of 191DG in vivo and by incubation with liver slices in vitro. Thus, the presence of 191DG improved the bioavailability of active metabolites after 450191-S administration.", 
    "44": "The interindividual variability of diazepam metabolism was studied using human livers. The formation of N-desmethyldiazepam (NDZ) and 3-hydroxydiazepam (temazepam, TMZ), was monitored by gas chromatography. In 10 livers, Km values for NDZ and TMZ formation varied independently from each other, each by a factor of 4, from 100 to 400 microM. This variability is consistent with the presence of at least two different cytochrome P-450 species controlling formation of these metabolites. In the same livers, Vmax for NDZ and TMZ production varied 6-fold and 15-fold, respectively.", 
    "45": "Serum protein binding of the basic enantiomers of disopyramide were studied in several animal species. (S)-(+)-Disopyramide was more highly bound than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer to serum protein in the man, gorilla, and pig. The reverse was true in cow serum, and in serum and albumin from sheep. Enantioselective differences in binding were due to differences in association constants. No enantioselective differences in binding were observed in serum protein from horse and goat, or in albumin from cow and pig. Disopyramide was highly bound to two sites on horse albumin. The association constant characterizing the binding of disopyramide to the first (major) site on horse albumin was 1.3 x 10(7) M-1. At predialysis concentrations of 10(-7) M, tris-(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate displaced disopyramide from sites on horse albumin and from sites on serum protein from the horse, man, gorilla, cow, and pig. At predialysis concentrations of 10(-5) M, warfarin and diazepam had no effect on disopyramide binding in these animal species. It is concluded that the enantioselective binding of disopyramide is species dependent, the site that is responsible for the moderate to high binding of disopyramide enantiomers is probably located on alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and the sites that bind disopyramide in the horse are located on albumin and may be unique.", 
    "46": "We studied a group of 23 manic patients to ascertain the prognostic significance of mixed affective features. Eight patients (34.8%) presented with a mixed manic state. This mixed state correlated with a longer hospitalization and significantly worse disposition outcome. In the light of previous conceptual models the authors speculate about the meaning of DSM-III defined mixed bipolar disorder.", 
    "47": "The role of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy was investigated by recording the electrophysiological responses of single cerebellar Purkinje neurons from rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy due to galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Both the GABAmimetic muscimol and the benzodiazepine receptor agonist flunitrazepam were 3-4 times more potent in depressing the spontaneous activity of Purkinje neurons from rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy than from control animals. Furthermore, qualitatively different responses of Purkinje neurons to benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (Ro 15-1788 and Ro 14-7437) were found in controls and rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy. These compounds markedly excited Purkinje neurons from rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy, but had either no effect (Ro 14-7437) or partially suppressed (Ro 15-1788) the spontaneous activity of neurons from control animals. In addition, incubation of Purkinje neurons from rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy with subthreshold concentrations of Ro 14-7437 reduced their sensitivity to muscimol, whereas treatment of control neurons with Ro 14-7437 had no effect on their sensitivity to muscimol. Finally, Purkinje neurons from hepatic encephalopathy and control rabbits displayed no difference in sensitivity to the depressant actions of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. These findings demonstrate a differential responsiveness of Purkinje neurons from an animal model of hepatic encephalopathy to ligands that interact with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Furthermore, the observations made in this experimental model are consistent with the involvement of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in mediating hepatic encephalopathy, and provide a potential explanation for the reported efficacy of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists in ameliorating this syndrome.", 
    "48": "Effect of acute administration of a benzodiazepine-inverse agonist, FG-7142, on forced swimming-induced depression was investigated in mice. A single injection of FG-7142 (40 mg/kg) showed a delayed increase in behavioral despair, the peak effect being observed on the 5th and 6th day of FG-7142 administration. beta-Adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline significantly potentiated FG-7142-induced behavioral despair. FG-7142-induced depression was sensitive to reversal by chronic treatment with propranolol or desipramine. These observations suggest that the inverse agonist FG-7142 upregulates beta-adrenoceptor population leading to behavioral despair in mice.", 
    "49": "We hypothesize that chronic alcohol abuse results in a loss of neurons and their associated synaptic receptors. This encephalopathy may be a precursor of brain atrophy and end-stage dementia. Autopsies were performed on normal brains of 27 alcoholics (mean age 62.5) and 30 nonalcoholic matched controls (mean age 64.4) free of other brain and liver diseases. None had recently received benzodiazepine medications. Gross brain atrophy was slight and equal in both groups. Benzodiazepine receptor densities and affinities in homogenates of frontal cortex were determined using [3H]flunitrazepam. Bmax specific binding was reduced by 20% in alcoholics compared with nonalcoholic controls of comparable age and with similar death-autopsy time intervals. The affinity was slightly less in the alcoholics. Wet tissue brain protein concentrations and their yields of 50,000-g pellet proteins were similar. Aging, death-autopsy time intervals, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diseases usually associated with hypoxia) had no significant effect on brain proteins, receptor densities, or affinities. We conclude that chronic alcoholism is associated with a loss of benzodiazepine receptor densities. Alcohol abuse may affect the results of post-mortem neurochemical investigations of other diseases.", 
    "50": "In order to study the neuronal basis of the pharmacological interactions between benzodiazepine receptor ligands and cortical cholinergic turnover, we examined the regional distribution of specific benzodiazepine binding sites using in vitro autoradiography. In the basal forebrain, the substantia innominata contained a high density of [3H]lormetazepam (LMZ) binding sites (Bmax = 277 fmol/mg tissue; Kd = 0.55 nM). The label could be displaced by diazepam (IC50 = 100 nM), the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist beta-carboline ZK 93426 (45 nM) and the partial inverse agonist beta-carboline FG 7142 (540 nM). It is hypothesized that the amnesic effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists are exerted through benzodiazepine receptors which are situated on cholinergic neurons in the substantia innominata and are involved in a tonic inhibition of cortical acetylcholine release. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93426 may exert its nootropic effects via benzodiazepine receptors in the substantia innominata and, consequently, by disinhibiting cortical acetylcholine release.", 
    "51": "The kynurenines, endogenous tryptophan metabolites with convulsant properties, have been postulated to play a role in the genesis of seizure disorders. We have previously reported that concentrations of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) higher than 0.2 mM are present in the brains of neonatal rats perinatally deprived of vitamin B-6. At a 1 mM concentration 3-HK significantly decreased the affinity of 3H-flunitrazepam for benzodiazepine receptor sites in rat brain membrane preparations. Furthermore, lower concentrations (Ki = 250 microM) of 3-HK antagonized the enhancing effect of GABA on 3H-flunitrazepam binding. These results suggest that 3-HK may have a modulatory effect on the GABA/benzodiazepine/barbiturate receptor complex.", 
    "52": "Daily treatment of mice with diazepam leads to the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effect of the benzodiazepine, while daily treatment with the proconvulsant benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG 7142 produces sensitization to its effects in that seizures develop (chemical kindling). In the present study, the effects of GABA receptor stimulation were studied 2 days after termination of 13 days treatment with diazepam, 20 mg/kg i.p./day, and FG 7142, 40 mg/kg i.p./day. For GABA receptor stimulation, the GABA agonist progabide was chosen because among several GABA receptor stimulants tested it was the only compound that induced increases in seizure threshold in non-toxic doses. Using the threshold for maximal (tonic extension) electroconvulsions as a measure for anticonvulsant efficacy, the anticonvulsant effect of progabide (100 mg/kg i.p.) was unchanged after chronic treatment with diazepam but was lost in FG 7142 kindled animals. Conversely, the hypothermic effect of progabide was reduced after treatment with diazepam but not with FG 7142. Baseline seizure threshold was unchanged 2 days after chronic administration of diazepam but increased in the FG 7142 pretreated mice. The data indicate that tolerance to benzodiazepines and kindling by FG 7142 are associated with different changes in GABA receptor function.", 
    "53": "There is general agreement now that elevation of intracellular calcium ion concentration [( Ca2+]i) mediates the physiological actions of a number of hormones, neurotransmitters and other pharmacological agents. In smooth muscle one way by which these agents elevate [Ca2+]i and induce contraction involves formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Our initial observation that the muscarinic-stimulated breakdown of PIP2 into IP3 and DG in the iris smooth muscle is a primary event that could couple activated receptors to contraction is now supported by the following: 1. In the iris sphincter contractions by carbachol (CCh) indicated close correlations, using different concentrations of CCh, atropine- and pirenzepine antagonists, time course, temperature and Ca2+, between the stimulated hydrolysis of PIP2, myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and muscle contraction. Further, studies on the relationships between receptor occupancy of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in this tissue, measured by [3H]QNB binding, and the CCh-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis, MLC phosphorylation and contraction revealed that all of these responses are coupled to the M2 receptor subtype. 2. NaF, which activates G proteins by promoting the dissociation of their subunits, produced a concentration-dependent activation of phospholipase C, measured as IP3 accumulation, and contraction in the iris sphincter muscle. 3. In permeabilized smooth muscle fibers, IP3 has been shown to release Ca2+ from the SR and induce contraction. 4. In the iris sphincter, as well as in other smooth muscles, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, which mimics the action of DG, induced MLC phosphorylation and contraction in a dose- and time-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "The postnatal development of the binding of [3H]muscimol to both high-affinity and low-affinity GABA receptors and of the activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase has been studied in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, striatum and hypothalamus of the rat, after prenatal exposure to diazepam. The dams were injected subcutaneously with single daily doses of 1 mg diazepam/kg from day 7-20 of gestation. The developmental profiles of the binding of [3H]muscimol to high-affinity GABA receptors were very similar in both control and diazepam-treated offspring. Prenatal administration of drug revealed no significant alteration in the binding of [3H]muscimol. The results in controls supported the concept of a sequential development of this population of GABA receptors in relation to the different maturation of structures in the brain. For the study of low-affinity GABA receptors, the dams were treated in the same way and, additionally, 1 mg diazepam/kg/day was injected subcutaneously in the offspring from postnatal day 5-10. At postnatal days 21 and 90, no qualitative or quantitative differences in the binding of [3H]muscimol to low-affinity GABA receptors in control and diazepam-exposed groups of animals were observed. The developmental profiles of the activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase were qualitatively very similar in the four areas of the brain studied. Prenatal exposure to diazepam revealed a transient elevation of the activity of the enzyme up to 33% in the frontal cortex, the cerebellum and the hypothalamus in the first postnatal week. The possible functional significance of these alterations is discussed.", 
    "55": "The affinity and the density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBzS) in tissues from the genital organs of female rats were studied during the oestrous cycle. When comparing PBzS density on the day of oestrus to PBzS density on the day of pro-oestrus, a significant increase was observed in the ovary (1.9-fold), oviduct (2.4-fold) and uterus (1.7-fold), but not in the kidney. Serum oestradiol also increased to a maximum on the day of pro-oestrus. The ovarian and uterine PBzS density and serum concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone were measured every 8 h between the days of dioestrus and pro-oestrus. Ovarian and uterine PBzS density increased to a maximal value at 01:00 and 09:00 h, respectively, on the day of pro-oestrus. However, a significant increase in PBzS density occurred in the ovary (P less than 0.02) and uterus (P less than 0.001) at 09:00 h on the day of pro-oestrus as compared to 09:00 h on the day of dioestrus. These changes were associated with an increase in serum oestradiol and progesterone concentrations. The affinity of PBzS in all tissues examined remained unaltered during the oestrous cycle. This study demonstrates that changes associated with the oestrous cycle occur in the density of PBzS in various genital organs.", 
    "56": "The conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used to determine a role for serotonin in the nucleus accumbens in the mediation of the rewarding properties of D-amphetamine morphine and diazepam. The effect of these drugs on CPP was examined in controls and in animals with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the nucleus accumbans. The results from control animals confirmed that D-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.), morphine (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) produced place preference for a distinctive environment that had previously been paired with injections of the drug. In animals with 80% reduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine content of the nucleus accumbens, D-amphetamine CPP was unchanged and morphine CPP was attenuated compared with controls. Diazepam CPP was not apparent in animals with the lesion. In separate experiments, characteristic behavioural effects of the drugs under study were examined in control and in animals with lesion. The results showed a tendency for increased amphetamine hyperlocomotion, enhanced morphine activity and analgesia and decreased diazepam anti-anxiety effect in animals with lesions. Thus, the 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the nucleus accumbens differently influenced the CPP induced by the drugs studied and, with the exception of diazepam, the various behavioural effects elicited by each drug. The findings suggest that serotonin-containing neurones of the nucleus accumbens are a component of the neural circuitry that mediates the rewarding properties of morphine, probably of diazepam, but not of D-amphetamine.", 
    "57": "Tolerance occurs to a number of the pharmacodynamic effects of benzodiazepines. To assess pharmacokinetic and neurochemical aspects of tolerance, lorazepam (LRZ) was administered chronically to mice via implantable osmotic pumps and rotarod ataxia, plasma and brain LRZ concentrations, benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo and in vitro, chloride channel binding and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake were examined in various brain regions over a 14-day period. Behavioral tolerance, indicated by diminished rotarod ataxia, developed at all doses examined (1, 2, 4 and 10 mg/kg/day), with little change occurring before day 4. The greatest decrease in rotarod ataxia occurred between days 4 and 7. Plasma and brain LRZ concentrations were proportional to dose and were constant over time at each dose, indicating that tolerance was not pharmacokinetic. Benzodiazepine receptor binding as determined by the specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788 decreased in cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus primarily between days 4 and 7, with an approximately 50% decrement in each region by day 7. Receptor binding and rotarod ataxia in cortex were highly correlated at each dose. Apparent affinity in vivo at the receptor was unchanged in cortex, indicating that altered ligand uptake was due to decreased receptor number. Similar results were observed in membrane preparations. There was a small, nonsignificant decrease in chloride channel binding at day 7 compared to day 1. Muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake into cortical synaptoneurosomes was decreased at day 7 compared to day 1. Thus, downregulation of benzodiazepine receptor binding and of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor function is closely associated with behavioral tolerance to benzodiazepines.", 
    "58": "Effects of acute and subacute administration of bicuculline on [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam, and t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to various brain regions were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. Acute administration of bicuculline affected neither the KD nor the Bmax of the three receptor sites. In rats treated subacutely with bicuculline (2 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 10 days), [3H]muscimol binding was increased in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, striatum, and substantia nigra. Scatchard analysis revealed that subacute treatment of rats with bicuculline resulted in a significantly lower KD of high-affinity sites in the striatum and in a significantly lower KD of high- and low-affinity sites in the frontal cortex. In the cerebellum, two binding sites were apparent in controls and acutely treated animals; however, only the high-affinity site was defined in subacutely treated animals, with an increase in the Bmax value. Triton X-100 treatment of frontal cortical membranes eliminated the difference in [3H]muscimol binding between control and subacute bicuculline treatments. On the other hand, [3H]muscimol binding was significantly increased in the cerebellum from bicuculline-treated animals even after Triton X-100 treatment. The apparent Ki of bicuculline for the GABAA receptor was also decreased in the frontal cortex and the striatum following the treatment. However, subacute administration of bicuculline affected neither the KD nor the Bmax of [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]TBPS binding in the frontal cortex and the cerebellum. These results suggest that GABAA receptors are up-regulated after subacute administration of bicuculline, with no change in benzodiazepine and picrotoxin binding sites.", 
    "59": "A \"withdrawal\" or \"rebound\" syndrome may follow the abrupt discontinuation of chronic treatment with benzodiazepines. To assess the neurochemical basis of this syndrome, mice were treated with lorazepam, 2 mg/kg/day for 7 days, a course which produces tolerance and downregulation of receptor binding and function. Behavioral studies indicated that open-field activity in lorazepam-treated mice was similar to controls at 1 day postlorazepam. Activity was increased at 4 days postlorazepam, and had returned to control levels by day 7. Benzodiazepine receptor binding as measured by specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788 in several brain regions returned to control levels by day 2 postbrazepam but had increased above controls at day 4 postlorazepam. Binding returned to control levels by day 7. Similar results were observed using [3H]flunitrazepam in membrane preparations. A similar time course was also observed for the maximum binding of the chloride channel ligand t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate during this period. The IC50 value for muscimol inhibition of t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding was decreased at day 4, suggesting increased coupling between gamma-aminobutyric acid and the chloride channel. Muscimol-stimulated [36Cl-] up-take in cortical synaptoneurosomes was increased at day 4 postlorazepam. These results indicate that the benzodiazepine discontinuation syndrome is associated with upregulation of receptor binding and function at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex.", 
    "60": "Behavioral and neurochemical effects of several drugs that increase punished responding were studied in pigeons. Key pecking was established under a schedule of reinforcement in which periods of food-maintained responding alternated with periods in which behavior also was suppressed by the presentation of electric shock. Buspirone (0.1-10.0 mg/kg), gepirone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.1-3.0 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (3.0-30.0 mg/kg) and to a lesser extent clozapine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) all produced increases in punished responding at doses having little effect on or decreasing the rate of unpunished responding. Neurochemical analyses on samples of cerebrospinal fluid after administration of several doses of each compound were performed for the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the noradrenergic metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG) and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Gepirone, 8-OH-DPAT and the novel anxiolytic buspirone produced decreases in 5-HIAA at doses that increased punished responding in the behavioral studies. Buspirone increased levels of HVA and DOPAC, whereas its structural analog gepirone and the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT had little effect on or decreased levels of these metabolites. Chlordiazepoxide, a prototypic benzodiazepine anxiolytic, produced only modest decreases in each of the metabolites studied. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, produced increases in each of the metabolites studied, although only the 5-HIAA effect occurred at doses that were not behaviorally disruptive. Haloperidol (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) produced only decreases in punished and unpunished responding, whereas eliciting increases in the appearance of MHPG, DOPAC and HVA; levels of 5-HIAA were relatively unaffected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Spontaneous EEG spikes (SPKs) were recorded from the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus in normal rats during behavioral states not accompanied by rhythmical slow activity (RSA) such as awake immobility and slow wave sleep. In the present study we examined the effects of various systemically administered drugs on hippocampal SPK activity. Three general anesthetics (ether, urethane and pentobarbital) all reduced SPK activity. At anesthetic doses both ether and pentobarbital completely abolished SPKs. This SPK abolition during anesthesia seemed qualitatively different from RSA-related SPK suppression in undrugged animals in that unlike the latter case RSA generation was not the cause of SPK abolition in the former case. Atropine (50-100 mg/kg, i.p.) did not change greatly SPK activity or its behavioral correlation. Diazepam (5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased amplitude and decreased frequency of hippocampal fast EEG activity, and reduced SPK activity. These effects may be based on the known action of diazepam to enhance GABA-mediated postsynaptic inhibition. At subepileptic doses (1-6 mg/kg, i.p.) the GABA antagonist bicuculline enhanced dramatically SPK-related activities. Particularly, SPK-concurrent population burst discharges in the pyramidal cell layer were greatly increased in amplitude and complexity after bicuculline. These results suggest that the SPK generation mechanism in the hippocampus is sensitive to the level of GABA-mediated inhibition.", 
    "62": "The effects of muscarinic stimulation on cyclic AMP accumulation and on basal and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-induced phosphoinositide turnover have been studied in rat pituitary GH3 tumour cells. Carbachol produced a dose-dependent atropine-sensitive inhibition of basal cyclic AMP accumulation. It had no effect on basal or TRH-stimulated production of inositol phosphates. The majority of the muscarinic receptors had a low affinity (Ki 0.22 microM) for pirenzepine and can be classified as M2 type, inhibiting adenylate cyclase but having no links with phosphoinositide metabolism.", 
    "63": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) have been shown to modulate voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in a number of neuronal and nonneuronal cell types and to competitively antagonize TRH binding to receptors on cells of the nervous system and anterior pituitary gland. Because interaction of TRH with its receptor is known to cause enhanced influx of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive channels in rat pituitary GH3 cells, it was determined whether BZs and TRH were interacting with the same binding site on these cells. The potencies of three BZs, Ro5-4864, diazepam (DZP), and chlordiazepoxide (CDE), were compared as modulators of Ca2+ channels and as inhibitors of TRH binding in GH3 cells. Modulation of Ca2+ channel activity was measured as the inhibition by BZs of K+ depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx using intracellularly trapped quin 2 or 45Ca2+ uptake. The three BZs caused dose-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ influx with an order of potency of Ro 5-4864 greater than DZP greater than CDE. In contrast, the order of potency of the three BZs to inhibit [3H]TRH binding was CDE greater than DZP much greater than Ro 5-4864. The concentrations of BZs needed to inhibit Ca2+ influx and TRH binding were in the micromolar range. These data show that BZs can modulate Ca2+ channel activity in endocrine cells and that these sites are distinct from those that modulate TRH binding on pituitary cells.", 
    "64": "Affinity column-purified GABA-benzodiazepine receptor proteins from human, cow, and rat brain were photoaffinity labeled with both [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol and examined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Using high receptor protein concentrations (1 microM), the benzodiazepine ligand [3H]flunitrazepam was incorporated covalently primarily into the expected 52 kiloDalton major subunit but also significantly into a second 57 kiloDalton peptide. Likewise the GABA ligand [3H]muscimol photolabeled primarily the 57 kiloDalton peptide but also to some extent the 52 kiloDalton peptide. This cross-labeling suggests strongly that both major subunits carry binding sites for both GABA and benzodiazepine.", 
    "65": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor binding was measured in sections of human, monkey and rat spinal cord using autoradiographical techniques. In each species, high levels of specific 125I-Bolton-Hunter CCK binding were detected in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn (the substantia gelatinosa). In monkey and human but not rat spinal cord, 125I-CCK binding was dose-dependently inhibited by low concentrations of the selective CCK-A antagonist L-364,718. Binding of [3H]L-364,718, which was saturable (Bmax = 29.0 +/- 0.95 pmol/g wet wt.) and of high affinity (pKd) = 9.92 +/- 0.16) was also detected in sections of monkey spinal cord and had a similar localization to that of specific 125I-CCK binding. These data indicate that in striking contrast to CCK receptors in rat spinal cord, those in the primate cord are of the CCK-A receptor subclass.", 
    "66": "The developmental aspects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex in mouse cultured spinal cord neurons was investigated in vitro. We examined benzodiazepine binding, GABA enhancement of benzodiazepine binding and GABA activation of chloride channels to intact cultured neurons during the development (days 1-14). Specific benzodiazepine binding increased with time from day 3 (Bmax = 546 fmol/mg protein) to day 14 (Bmax = 1746 fmol/mg protein). There was no significant difference in the affinity (Kd) of [3H]flunitrazepam for its receptor sites from day 3 to 14. Specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the intact cells was also increased in the presence of GABA during all stages of development. The EC50 value of the GABA concentration (14-16 microM) required to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding did not change from day 3 to 14. GABA receptor-activated chloride channels, studied by 36Cl-influx was also observed at all ages in culture, and indicated an early development (as early as day 3) of these GABA-gated channels. These studies indicate that GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex develop early in cultured spinal cord neurons, and these neurons provide an ideal system to study GABAergic events.", 
    "67": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a naturally occurring phospholipid that serves as a critical mediator in diverse biological and pathophysiological processes. In this study of the interactions of PAF with neuronal cells, it was found that PAF increased the intracellular levels of free calcium ions in cells of the clones NG108-15 and PC12. The increase was dependent on extracellular calcium and was inhibited by the antagonistic PAF analog CV-3988 and by the calcium-influx blockers prenylamine and diltiazem. A functional consequence of this interaction was revealed by measuring a PAF-elicited, Ca2+-dependent secretion of adenosine triphosphate from PC12 cells. Exposure of NG108-15 cells for 3 to 4 days to low concentrations of PAF induced neuronal differentiation; higher concentrations were neurotoxic. Thus, by influencing Ca2+ fluxes, PAF may play a physiological role in neuronal development and a pathophysiological role in the degeneration that occurs when neurons are exposed to circulatory factors as a result of trauma, stroke, or spinal cord injury.", 
    "68": "The binding of hexahydrosiladifenidol, procyclidine, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine) and AF-DX 116 to muscarinic receptors in the heart, ileum, urinary bladder, parotid gland and cerebral cortex from guinea pig was studied in competition experiments with (-)-[3H]QNB. The affinity of AF-DX 116 was higher in the heart than in the cortex and it was extremely low in the parotid gland. The affinities of hexahydrosiladefinidol, procyclidine and 4-DAMP were higher in the cortex and parotid gland than in the heart, bladder and ileum. Hexahydrosiladifenidol and 4-DAMP recognized two classes of muscarinic binding sites in the cortex. However, in contrast to functional data, binding results showed that 4-DAMP hexahydrosiladifenidol and procyclidine did not distinguish between the sites in the smooth muscles and those in the heart. Nevertheless, the present data support the view that the putative M2-receptors are heterogeneous, since the four drugs examined were found to distinguish between the muscarinic binding sites in the parotid gland and those in smooth muscles and heart.", 
    "69": "In two separate research centres the ability of RO 15-4513 to protect rats against the lethal effects of ethanol (7.5 and 15 g/kg) was investigated. In neither study did RO 15-4513 offer protection against ethanol-induced lethality or the loss of righting reflex caused by these doses of ethanol. These data fail to replicate the results of an earlier report and suggest that RO 15-4513 is unlikely to be clinically useful treating acute severe ethanol toxicity.", 
    "70": "The effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists were examined on seizure thresholds determined by intravenous infusions of convulsants in rodents. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor antagonists were proconvulsant; dose dependently reducing the threshold for pentylenetetrazol- or bicuculline-induced tonic seizures. Strychnine-induced tonic seizures were unaffected. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine, BHT-933 and UK 14,304 did not modify pentylenetetazol-induced seizures at low or moderate doses but at high doses clonidine and BHT-933 were proconvulsant. The facilitatory effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists on pentylenetetrazol-induced tonic seizures was blocked by clonidine or UK 14,304. The proconvulsant action of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists was contrasted with that of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, a benzodiazepine receptor contragonist, which markedly reduced the threshold for seizure initiation rather than the tonic seizure threshold. The selective facilitatory action of alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade on tonic seizures suggests that a noradrenergic mechanism is involved in the control of seizure propagation rather than seizure initiation.", 
    "71": "Acute benzodiazepine administration has been reported to antagonize the effect of cholecystokinin both in the periphery and in the central nervous system. A two-week treatment with either diazepam (5 mg/kg per day) or flurazepam (15 mg/kg per day) markedly reduced the excitatory effect of microiontophoretically applied sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide-(26-33) on rat CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons but not that of acetylcholine. In view of the sustained anxiolytic activity of benzodiazepines that contrasts with their transient sedative effect, the present results suggest that the reduction of neuronal responsiveness to cholecystokinin by these drugs might be related to their anxiolytic property.", 
    "72": "The effect of a benzodiazepine, flurazepam, on the spontaneous activity of neurons in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra was studied in chloral hydrate anesthetized rats. Flurazepam produced a dose-related suppression of neuronal activity. In rats that were chronically treated with flurazepam, tolerance to flurazepam was present after 7 and 28 days, but not after only 3 days of treatment. Tolerance persisted at least 2, but not 7 days after 4 weeks of chronic treatment.", 
    "73": "Bath-application of nicotine (800 microM) to mouse hippocampal slices resulted in an increase in the amplitude of the population spike and the appearance of multiple population spikes in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Similar effects were observed after perfusion of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide (2 microM) and the glutamate decarboxylase inhibitor L-C-allylglycine (4 mM). These apparently excitatory effects of nicotine (800 microM) could be reversed by bath-application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 400 microM), as well as by the GABA uptake inhibitor nipecotic acid (5 mM) and the benzodiazepine flurazepam (4 microM). Nicotine did not alter binding of [3H]GABA or [3H]flunitrazepam to whole brain plasma membranes. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the electrophysiological effects of nicotine on CA1 pyramidal cell excitability is mediated by disruption of GABAergic transmission.", 
    "74": "Following an intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (1 g/kg), spontaneous saccades performed by pigmented rats showed a backward post-saccadic drift which was still present 45 min after the administration. When 5 mg/kg of Ro 15-4513 were injected, 15 min after ethanol, there was an immediate remarkable reduction in post-saccadic drift amplitude, with a full recovery in about 30 min after Ro 15-4513 administration. This drug is thus able to reverse the effect of ethanol and to restore effectively a mechanism of motor integration.", 
    "75": "The extent to which diazepam, diazepam-N4-oxide and N4-desoxychlordiazepoxide irreversibly bind to plasma protein upon UV irradiation was determined. Comparison with the results for chlordiazepoxide leads to the conclusion that the N4-oxide function is essential for the occurrence of irreversible binding in vitro. Investigation of the photopharmacology of diazepam in the rat gave results similar to those for N4-desoxychlordiazepoxide: in contrast with what already had been found for chlordiazepoxide no difference was observed between the pharmacology of diazepam in UV-A irradiated rats and those kept in the dark. Both in vitro and in vivo data expand the hypothesis to other 7-chloro-1,4-benzodiazepines, according to which the presence of an N4-oxide group is a prerequisite for the occurrence of phototoxicity and that an oxaziridine is the toxic intermediate.", 
    "76": "Stimulation of leucine uptake by addition of concanavalin A, mediated by increase of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]), in lymphocytes (Mitsumoto, Y., Sato, K. and Mohri, T. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 968, 353-358) was abolished by N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7) and chlorpromazine, which inhibited membrane hyperpolarization induced by the mitogen. Quinine (0.5-1 mM) completely inhibited the concanavalin A-induced hyperpolarization and extensively inhibited the induced stimulation of leucine uptake. Based on these results, we suggest that the stimulation of leucine uptake by concanavalin A is largely due to activation of the Ca2+-dependent K+ channel which reinforces negative potential of the plasma membrane and is regulated by calmodulin.", 
    "77": "Three pairings of rats (two derived from divergent, selective breeding and one from divergent environmental conditions) were compared with regard to behavioral and hormonal parameters. Striking differences were observed: results obtained in our own laboratory as well as those found in a review of the literature pointed to higher emotionality (e.g., increased defecation and corticosterone secretion, etc.) in Roman low-avoidance, Wistar-Kyoto and group-housed rats, as compared to their respective counterparts, Roman high-avoidance, spontaneously hypertensive, and individually housed Wistar rats. Concomitant receptor binding studies reviewed here (3H-diazepam- and 3H-imipramine-binding sites) have revealed, however, less consistent intrapair differences.", 
    "78": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-operated chloride channel complex was evaluated in mice selected for differential sensitivity to the ataxic effects of diazepam (diazepam-sensitive (DS) and diazepam-resistant (DR) lines). The ataxic effects of several drugs purported to produce some of their actions through the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex were examined using the rotarod test. The duration of impairment produced by diazepam, ethanol, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazol[5,4-C]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) and phenobarbital was greater in the diazepam-sensitive than in the diazepam-resistant mice. In contrast, pentobarbital produced an equivalent duration of ataxia in the two lines. Muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- influx and the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) and [3H]flunitrazepam were measured using isolated brain membrane vesicles (microsacs). Depolarization-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was measured in whole brain synaptosomes. Muscimol was a more potent stimulator of 36Cl- flux in the DS compared to the DR mice, although no difference between the lines was found in muscimol-stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Flunitrazepam augmented the muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in the DS but not in the DR mice. However, no differences between the lines of mice were found in either density or affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites. Similarly, no differences in either the density or affinity of [35S]TBPS binding sites was found. Ethanol (10-45 mM) potentiated the muscimol-stimulation of 36Cl- in DS, with no effect in DR mice. However, ethanol inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding was equivalent in the two lines of mice. Pentobarbital produced an equal potentiation of the muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- flux in the two lines, but phenobarbital potentiated the muscimol-induced 36Cl- influx slightly more in DS mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
