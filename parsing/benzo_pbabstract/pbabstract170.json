Several reports have indicated that a -2548A/G single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the leptin gene is associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. We hypothesized that there is a similar relationship between the -2548A/G SNP and olanzapine-induced weight gain. A total of 74 Korean schizophrenic patients were examined. Their weight was measured before starting olanzapine and after long-term treatment lasting for at least 3 months. The weight gain was significantly higher for patients with the AG genotype than for those with the AA genotype (p=0.029). Analysis of covariance also showed the difference of weight gain was still significant when adjusted for sex and treatment duration (p=0.046). This finding supports the presence of a relationship between the -2548A/G SNP of the leptin gene and weight gain in Korean schizophrenic patients receiving olanzapine treatment.", 
    "1": "In vivo plasma pharmacokinetics of midazolam hydrochloride (5 mg/kg i.v.) were determined in commercially raised broiler chickens, turkeys, ring-necked pheasants and bobwhite quail. Pharmacokinetic profiles of midazolam were similar for all four species, especially with regard to the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve. Estimates of the half-life of elimination of midazolam were 0.42, 1.45, 1.90, and 9.71 h for turkeys, chickens, bobwhite quail, and pheasant, respectively. This was similar to the major metabolite (1-hydroxymidazolam). Elimination half-lives for 1-hydroxymidazolam were 1.35, 1.86, 1.97, and 13.97 h for turkey, chicken, bobwhite quail and pheasant, respectively. Elimination half-lives for 4-hydroxymidazolam were 0.76, 1.23, 2.85, and 13.82 h for chicken, turkey, pheasant, and bobwhite quail, respectively. In addition to traditional pharmacokinetic approaches to parameter estimation, a bootstrapping technique was employed to attempt to achieve more realistic approximations of the concentrations at later time-points.", 
    "2": "In this study we examined activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A, 2C, 2D and 3A using hepatic microsomes from five male and five female cats. CYP1A, 2C, 2D and 3A activities were referred by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD), tolbutamide hydroxylation (TBH), bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (BLH) and midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylation respectively. The anti-rat CYP1A2 and CYP3A2 serum significantly inhibited EROD and midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylation, suggesting that EROD and midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylation were catalysed by CYP1A and 3A in cats respectively. Quinidine inhibited BLH in cats microsomes at quite low concentrations, suggesting that BLH was catalysed by CYP2D in cats. Tolbutamide hydroxylation activities were negligible in hepatic microsomes from both male and female cats, suggesting CYP2C activities of cats are extremely low. This suggests that CYP2C substrates should be carefully administered to cats. Although there is no sexual difference in CYP1A activities, there are differences in CYP2D and 3A activities of cats. CYP2D activities were higher (3-fold), but CYP3A activities were lower (one-fifth) in female cats. These results might suggest that CYP2D and 3A substrates should be prescribed for male and female cats using different dosage regimen.", 
    "3": "Alterations in muscarinic M1 receptor protein and mRNA expression have been revealed in post-mortem brains of schizophrenia patients. Most patients had been treated with antipsychotics, so medication effects cannot be excluded as a possible explanation for these results. With in situ hybridization, this study investigated M1 receptor mRNA expression in rats treated with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg/day) and the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine (1.5 mg/kg/day) and aripiprazole (2.25 mg/kg/day) for 1 or 12 weeks. Compared with the control group, haloperidol significantly increased (approximately 13-21%, P < 0.05) M1 mRNA expression in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus after both 1 and 12 weeks of treatment, and it also increased (approximately 17%, P < 0.01) M1 mRNA expression in the substantia nigra compacta after 1 week of treatment. Olanzapine significantly increased (14-22%, P < 0.05) M1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, and CA3) and substantia nigra compacta after 12 weeks of treatment, but not after 1 week. Aripiprazole significantly increased (17%, P < 0.01) M1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus (CA1) after both 1 and 12 week treatments and increased (12%, P < 0.05) M1 mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens after 1 week of treatment. Despite their different affinities for muscarinic M1 receptors, all three antipsychotic medications induced a similar trend of change in M1 mRNA expression in selected brain regions. These data suggest that the decreased M1 receptor protein and mRNA expression observed in schizophrenia patients is unlikely to be a consequence of drug treatments and implicates muscarinic M1 receptors in the pharmacotherapy of the disease.", 
    "4": "Low hepatic cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) activities might play an important role for inducing osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) by corticosteroids. However, the relationship between hepatic CYP3A activity and steroid-induced ONFH is unknown. We have examined the relationship between hepatic CYP3A activity and the inducibility of ONFH in a rabbit model. Sixty rabbits were divided into three groups. Hepatic CYP3A inducer (phenobarbital, group P; n = 15), inhibitor (itraconazole, group I; n = 15), or saline (group C, n = 30) was administrated for 3 weeks before intramuscular methylprednisolone. In groups P and I, hepatic CYP3A levels were measured by midazolam clearance before treatment (baseline) and before methylprednisolone injection. All animals were sacrificed 3 weeks after methylprednisolone injection and both femurs were harvested and examined histologically for osteonecrosis. Midazolam clearance was significantly increased and decreased, compared with baseline in groups P and I respectively (p < 0.0005, p < 0.002). The incidence of osteonecrosis in group P (33%) was significantly lower than in group I (100%) and group C (83%; p < 0.001 for both). The percentage necrotic area to whole bone marrow area on cross sections in group P (8.2 +/- 5.9%) was significantly lower than in group I (69.8 +/- 20.8%) and group C (51.5 +/- 30.7%; p < 0.005 for both). Hepatic CYP3A activity inversely correlated with the incidence of osteonecrosis and extent of the necrotic area caused by the same dose of corticosteroids, suggesting possible prevention of the steroid-induced osteonecrosis by reducing steroid dose in poor corticosteroid metabolizers.",

In two case reports it is told about patients with both diagnosis. Due to this they were treated with an atypical neurolepticum (Olanzapine) to reach three targets: Therapy of the depression, pain i.e. atypical facial neuralgia and mood stabilizing.

    "6": "Information is lacking on whether the CYP3A5 genotype affects the disposition and effects of midazolam during the long-term intensive care sedation of patients. This study was undertaken to estimate whether the CYP3A5 genotype can explain a relevant portion of pharmacokinetic interindividual variability.", 
    "7": "We determined the CYP3A5 genotype in 71 Caucasian patients who underwent long-term sedation during intensive care treatment. We then assessed the relation between the genotype and both the plasma concentrations of midazolam and 1'-OH-midazolam in 645 plasma samples and the simultaneously estimated Ramsay sedation score, both of which were recorded during routine midazolam drug monitoring.", 
    "8": "Eight patients had the CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype and 63 patients the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype. The concentration-dose ratio [C/D; plasma concentration of midazolam (ng/ml) divided by the rate of infusion (mg/h); expressed as the mean (95% confidence interval)] was 87.4 (70.8, 108.9) for the *3/*3 patients and 79.0 (48.9, 129.0) for *1/*3 patients. The corresponding data for infusion rate (IR; in mg/h), Ramsay score (RS) and the ratio 1'-OH-midazolam concentration/midazolam concentration (ROH) for *3/*3 and *1/*3 patients were IR 7.4 (6.2, 8.6) vs. 11.4 (4.9, 17.9), RS 5.4 (5.2, 5.6) vs. 5.3 (4.2, 6.0) and ROH 0.11 (0.09, 0.13) vs. 0.17 (0.11, 0.26), respectively.", 
    "9": "The CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype did not lead to an apparently lower midazolam concentration/dose ratio or Ramsay score values. As the present sedation procedure during intensive care therapy may be described as a physician closed-loop titration towards Ramsay scores of 4 +/- 1, our data do not indicate that prior determination of the genotype will result in better care or economic savings.", 
    "10": "The changes in antioxidant-oxidant balance play important roles in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric conditions. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a psychiatric condition with recurrent mood disturbances. This study evaluates the effects of treatment with lithium, alone or in combination with antipsychotic olanzapine, on oxidant-antioxidant status and atherogenic character in patients with BD. The blood samples from 15 patients were tested before the treatment (pre-treatment phase) and at the ends of two consecutive treatment periods: period I, treatment with lithium and an antipsychotic drug, olanzapine (first 6 months) and period II, treatment with only lithium (6 months following period I). We measured serum atherogenic lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol), plasma lipid peroxides (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances), antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) in neutrophils and lymphocytes, and total antioxidant status in plasma. Compared with pre-treatment phase, the lipid parameters were increased with each treatment; especially, LDL-cholesterol was significantly increased only with lithium treatment. These findings alert to be cautious about use of lithium in patients with atherogenic conditions. Moreover, plasma lipid peroxides were decreased significantly after the combination therapy and further decreased with lithium treatment. Antioxidant enzyme activities in lymphocytes were decreased after both types of treatment. Importantly, plasma total antioxidant status was increased only with lithium treatment. Thus, treatment with lithium alone decreases already up-set oxidant status in BD. In conclusion, the combination therapy with olanzapine is better in terms of atherogenic profile, while lithium alone produces better antioxidant status in patients with BD.", 
    "11": "Phasic (synaptic) and tonic (extrasynaptic) inhibition represent the two most fundamental forms of GABA(A) receptor-mediated transmission. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) generated by GABA(A) receptors are typically extremely rapid synaptic events that do not last beyond a few milliseconds. Although unusually slow GABA(A) IPSCs, lasting for tens of milliseconds, have been observed in recordings of spontaneous events, their origin and mechanisms are not known. We show that neocortical GABA(A,slow) IPSCs originate from a specialized interneuron called neurogliaform cells. Compared with classical GABA(A,fast) IPSCs evoked by basket cells, single spikes in neurogliaform cells evoke extraordinarily prolonged GABA(A) responses that display tight regulation by transporters, low peak GABA concentration, unusual benzodiazepine modulation, and spillover. These results reveal a form of GABA(A) receptor mediated communication by a dedicated cell type that produces slow ionotropic responses with properties intermediate between phasic and tonic inhibition.", 
    "12": "We review the types and causes of convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) in infants and young children in Japan, and discuss the current recommendations for the use of intravenous (IV) drugs in managing this condition, and report on our clinical experiences. There are prolonged or continuous CSE and clustered or intermittent CSE, and treatments are different between them. In Japan, fosphenytoin and IV preparation of lorazepam and phenobarbital are not available. Recently, midazolam and lidocaine (LDC) have been widely used, although neither of these drugs have official approval for the management of CSE. Febrile seizures and epilepsies are common causes of CSE in infants and young children in Japan, followed by benign infantile convulsions (BIC), convulsions with gastroenteritis (CwG), and acute encephalitis with refractory CSE and intractable epilepsy (AECSEE), which are familiar disorders in Japan. BIC and CwG frequently present with clustered CSE and do not respond to IV diazepam, but have an excellent response with oral carbamazepine or IV LDC. CSE in AECSEE requires control with barbiturate coma. The Research Committee on Clinical Evidence of Medical Treatment for Status Epilepticus in Childhood has developed a proposed guideline for the treatment of CSE in childhood in Japan by an evidence-based approach and consensus conference. Initial management of seizures should be attempted mainly with IV diazepam, the second-line treatment involves IV midazolam followed by IV phenytoin if seizures persist, and the third-line treatment requires barbiturate coma. However, our experience of 247 episodes of CSE in 77 patients, predominantly with chronic epilepsy, required different second-line treatments for prolonged CSE compared with clustered CSE: the former were treated with IV midazolam or pentobarbital, and the latter were given IV phenytoin or LDC. We propose modifications to the guideline for CSE that the second-line treatment is divided by prolonged CSE and clustered CSE, and that the procedures for brain protection and systemic management are added.", 
    "13": "Theophylline-associated seizures (TAS) are considered a neurologic emergency, as they can sometimes be intractable and difficult to stop with standard treatments such as intravenous administration of diazepam. As a consequence, a proportion of patients who experience status epilepticus while receiving theophylline will require endotracheal intubation. The optimal first-line therapy for TAS has not yet been fully investigated. We compared 54 cases of TAS with 779 cases of non-TAS, that had presented at a single institution between 1991 and 2002. Among the 54 cases of TAS, 36 experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with the remainder experiencing partial seizures. TAS occurred mainly in children under 3 years of age, and serum theophylline levels were within the therapeutic range in 78% of the cases. The duration of TAS tended to be longer than for non-TAS, and intravenous administration of diazepam was less effective in controlling TAS (45%), compared with non-TAS (68%). Many cases required repeated injections of diazepam, and 15 cases (27%) eventually required endotracheal intubation. Reports concerning the therapy for TAS were also reviewed. Theophylline is known to antagonize the effects of benzodiazepines, and this may explain why drugs such as diazepam are relatively ineffective in treating TAS. In TAS, the prompt use of barbiturates is recommended when diazepam is not effective, to avoid potential brain injury secondary to status epilepticus.", 
    "14": "Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) in childhood is a medical emergency and its aetiology and outcome mean that it should be studied separately from adult CSE. The incidence in developed countries is between 17 and 23/100,000 with a higher incidence in younger children. Febrile CSE is the commonest single group with a good prognosis in sharp distinction to CSE related to central nervous system infections which have a high mortality. The aim of treatment is to intervene at 5 min and studies indicate that intravenous (i.v.) lorazepam may be a better first-line treatment than rectal diazepam and i.v. phenytoin a better second-line treatment than rectal paraldehyde. An epidemiological study strongly supports the development of prehospital treatment with buccal midazolam becoming a widely used but unlicensed option in the community. More than two doses of benzodiazepines increase the rate of respiratory depression without obvious benefit. The 1 year recurrence rate is 17% and the hospital mortality is about 3%.", 
    "15": "Status epilepticus (SE) describes an enduring epileptic state during which seizures are unremitting and tend to be self-perpetuating. We describe the clinical phases of generalized convulsive SE, impending SE, established SE, and subtle SE. We discuss the physiological and biochemical cascades which characterize self-sustaining SE (SSSE) in animal models. At the transition from single seizures to SSSE, GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors move from the synaptic membrane to the cytoplasm, where they are functionally inactive. This reduces the number of GABAA receptors available for binding GABA or GABAergic drugs, and may in part explain the development of time-dependent pharmacoresistance to benzodiazepines and the tendency of seizures to become self-sustaining. At the same time, 'spare' subunits of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptors move from subsynaptic sites to the synaptic membrane, causing further hyperexcitability and possibly explaining the preserved sensitivity to NMDA blockers late in the course of SE. Maladaptive changes in neuropeptide expression occur on a slower time course, with depletion of the inhibitory peptides dynorphin, galanin, somatostatin and neuropeptide Y, and with an increased expression of the proconvulsant tachykinins, substance P and neurokinin B. Finally, SE-induced neuronal injury and epileptogenesis are briefly discussed.", 
    "16": "The benzodiazepine Ro 11-3128 (methyl-clonazepam) presents several similarities with praziquantel with regard to its anti-schistosomal mode of action, since both drugs cause spastic paralysis, calcium influx and tegumental disruption in the parasites. In order to know whether the two compounds share the same binding sites in the schistosomes, we performed in vivo and in vitro competition experiments. We took advantage of the fact that Ro 11-3128 is active against immature Schistosoma mansoni (whereas praziquantel is inactive), and praziquantel is active against S. japonicum (which is insensitive to Ro 11-3128). An excess of praziquantel did not inhibit the activity of Ro 11-3128 against immature S. mansoni and an excess of Ro 11-3128 did not inhibit the activity of praziquantel against S. japonicum, suggesting that the schistosome binding sites of the two drugs are different. On the other hand, cytochalasin D, an agent known to perturb--among other things--calcium channel function, was capable of inhibiting the schistosomicidal activity of both praziquantel and Ro 11-3128, thus adding another element of similarity between the two anti-schistosomal agents. A similar, albeit partial, inhibition of the schistosomicidal activity of the two drugs was exerted by some of the classical calcium channel blockers. Taken together, these results suggest that praziquantel and Ro 11-3128, although binding to different schistosome receptor sites, may use the same basic anti-schistosomal effector mechanisms.", 
    "17": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, complex and heterogeneous mental disorder, with pathological features of disrupted neuronal excitability and plasticity within limbic structures of the brain. These pathological features manifest behaviorally as positive symptoms (including hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder), negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal, apathy and emotional blunting) and other psychopathological symptoms (such as psychomotor retardation, lack of insight, poor attention and impulse control). Altered glutamate neurotransmission has for decades been linked to schizophrenia, but all commonly prescribed antipsychotics act on dopamine receptors. LY404039 is a selective agonist for metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptors and has shown antipsychotic potential in animal studies. With data from rodents, we provide new evidence that mGlu2/3 receptor agonists work by a distinct mechanism different from that of olanzapine. To clinically test this mechanism, an oral prodrug of LY404039 (LY2140023) was evaluated in schizophrenic patients with olanzapine as an active control in a randomized, three-armed, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Treatment with LY2140023, like treatment with olanzapine, was safe and well-tolerated; treated patients showed statistically significant improvements in both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to placebo (P < 0.001 at week 4). Notably, patients treated with LY2140023 did not differ from placebo-treated patients with respect to prolactin elevation, extrapyramidal symptoms or weight gain. These data suggest that mGlu2/3 receptor agonists have antipsychotic properties and may provide a new alternative for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

Data collected included sociodemographic, clinical, social, and therapeutic information and the Severity of Psychiatric Illness (SPI) score.", 
    "20": "Borderline personality disorder was the diagnosis in 1,032 of the visits (9%) to the emergency department, which corresponded to 540 individuals. Of these visits, 11% required hospitalization. Multivariate statistical logistic regression analysis showed that the decision to hospitalize was associated with risk of suicide, danger to others, severity of symptoms, difficulty with self-care, and noncompliance with treatment. The decision to prescribe benzodiazepines was related to male sex, anxiety as the reason for seeking care, little difficulty with self-care, few medical or drug problems, and housing instability. Factors related to the prescription of antipsychotics were male sex, risk of endangering others, and psychosis as the reason for the visit. Factors associated with the prescription of antidepressants were depression as the reason for seeking help and little premorbid dysfunction.", 
    "21": "Patients with borderline personality disorder had greater clinical severity, but the percentage of hospitalizations was lower than for patients without the disorder. Although a psychiatric emergency service is not the ideal setting to initiate pharmacotherapy, in practice, psychiatrists often prescribe medications in this setting.

In these studies, bispectral index values of sedated children were recorded in a blinded fashion, and sedation depth was scored using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS). Bispectral index was evaluated across UMSS scores for several age groups and during use of each sedative agent (with/without opioids).", 
    "24": "There was a moderate inverse correlation between bispectral index and UMSS for all age groups. There were significant differences in bispectral index across UMSS and between each sedation level except UMSS 3 to 4 in all the age groups and UMSS 0 to 1 in infants. The mean bispectral index and the cutoff values on the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for mild, moderate, and deep sedation were significantly lower in infants < or = 6 months compared with older children at each sedation level. Bispectral index was reasonably sensitive and specific in differentiating mild (UMSS 0-1) from deeper (UMSS 3-4) levels of sedation but poorly differentiated between moderate and deep levels of sedation in all age groups. There was a moderate correlation between bispectral index and UMSS during the use of chloral hydrate, pentobarbital, propofol, and midazolam but poor correlation during ketamine or opioid use. Bispectral index values were significantly lower during deep sedation with propofol and pentobarbital compared with midazolam and chloral hydrate.",

    "26": "One prerequisite for therapeutic effects of psychiatric drugs is the ability to pass the blood brain barrier. Hence, it is important to know the concentration of antipsychotic drugs in brain tissue. In general, determinations of lipophilic compounds from lipophilic matricies such as the brain are a challenge. Here we have adapted a plasma assay for antipsychotics for the target organ the brain. Using modified sample preparation and chromatographic strategies, the analytes were extracted from rat brain homogenate and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The method used a Waters Atlantis dC-18 (30 mm x 2.1 mm i.d., 3 microm) column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/5 mM ammonium formate (pH 6.1 adjusted with formic acid) and gradient elution. All analytes were detected in positive ion mode using multiple-reaction monitoring. The method was validated and the linearity, lower limit of quantitation, precision, accuracy, recoveries, specificity and stability were determined. This method was then successfully used to quantify the rat brain tissue concentration of the analytes after chronic treatment with these antipsychotic drugs.",

Twenty minutes later, physiological saline, ATI (200 microg/kg), FLU (0.1 mg/kg), 4AP (0.5 mg/kg), ATI-FLU, FLU-4AP, ATI-4AP or ATI-FLU-4AP was administered intravenously. FLU, 4AP alone, or FLU-4AP did not effectively antagonise the anaesthesia, hypothermia, bradycardia, and bradypnoea induced by MED-MID-KET. ATI alone was effective. ATI-FLU, ATI-4AP and ATI-FLU-4AP combinations produced an immediate and effective recovery from anaesthesia. The combination of ATI-FLU-4AP was the most effective in antagonising the anaesthetic effects, but was associated with tachycardia, tachypnoea, excitement, and muscle tremors. Combinations with ATI are more effective for antagonising anaesthesia, but ATI-FLU-4AP is not suitable.",

    "36": "Withdrawal from 1-week oral administration of the benzodiazepine, flurazepam (FZP) is associated with increased alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor (AMPAR) miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) but reduction of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR)-evoked (e)EPSCs in hippocampal CA1 neurons. A positive correlation was observed between increased AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitude and anxiety-like behavior in 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats. These effects were disrupted by systemic AMPAR antagonist administration (GYKI-52466, 0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) at withdrawal onset, strengthening the hypothesis that CA1 neuron AMPAR-mediated hyperexcitability is a central component of a functional anatomic circuit associated with the expression of withdrawal anxiety. Abolition of AMPAR current upregulation in 2-day FZP withdrawn rats by GYKI-52466 injection also reversed the reduction in NMDAR-mediated eEPSC amplitude in CA1 neurons from the same rats, suggesting that downregulation of NMDAR function may serve a protective, negative-feedback role to prevent AMPAR-mediated neuronal overexcitation. NMDAR antagonist administration (MK-801, 0.25 mg/kg intraperitoneally) had no effect on modifying increased glutamatergic strength or on withdrawal anxiety, whereas injection of an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist, nimodipine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) averted AMPAR current enhancement and anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that these manifestations may be initiated by a voltage-gated calcium channel-dependent signal transduction pathway. An evidence-based model of likely cellular mechanisms in the hippocampus contributing to benzodiazepine withdrawal anxiety was proposed implicating regulation of multiple CA1 neuron ion channels.",

Diazepam and imipramine were used as reference drugs. SB-258585 at a dose of 1 microg (but not 0.3 and 3 microg) showed an anticonflict effect that was weaker than that of diazepam (40 microg). SB-258585 at a dose of 3 microg (but not 1 and 10 microg) produced a marked anti-immobility effect comparable with that of imipramine (0.1 microg). The anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity of SB-258585 seemed to be specific, as that compound--when given by the same route in doses effective in each model--did not affect the shock threshold, nonpunished water consumption, or exploratory activity of rats. The results obtained indicate that the hippocampus is one of the neuroanatomical sites involved in the anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-258585.", 
    "38": "We compared the changes in weight (kg) and body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)) in 52 hospitalized adolescents between baseline and after 12 weeks of monotherapy with either (i) olanzapine (OLZ) orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) (N=16; 16.6 mg/day+/-4.4 [SD]), or (ii) OLZ standard oral tablets (SOT) (N=10; 18.0 mg/day+/-4.2), or (iii) risperidone (N=26; 2.8 mg/day+/-1.2). Significantly greater increases in mean weight and BMI were observed in the patients treated with OLZ SOT (8.9+/-5.1 [SD] kg; 1.9+/-0.6 kg/m(2), respectively) than in those with ODT (3.0+/-2.1 kg; 1.1+/-0.8 kg/m(2)). Similarly, OLZ ODT treatment was associated with significantly greater increases in weight and BMI than risperidone (1.0+/-1.8 kg; 0.4+/-0.7 kg/m(2)). These findings suggest that adolescents gain less weight with OLZ ODT than OLZ SOT, possibly because the former formulation shortens the time of interaction with digestive serotonin receptors mediating satiety.", 
    "39": "gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays important roles in the central nervous system, acting as a neurotransmitter on both ionotropic ligand-gated Cl(-)-channels, and metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These two types of receptors called GABA(A) (and C) and GABA(B) are the targets of major therapeutic drugs such as the anxiolytic benzodiazepines, and antispastic drug baclofen (lioresal(R)), respectively. Although the multiplicity of GABA(A) receptors offer a number of possibilities to discover new and more selective drugs, the molecular characterization of the GABA(B) receptor revealed a unique, though complex, heterodimeric GPCR. High throughput screening strategies carried out in pharmaceutical industries, helped identifying new compounds positively modulating the activity of the GABA(B) receptor. These molecules, almost devoid of apparent activity when applied alone, greatly enhance both the potency and efficacy of GABA(B) agonists. As such, in contrast to baclofen that constantly activates the receptor everywhere in the brain, these positive allosteric modulators induce a large increase in GABA(B)-mediated responses only WHERE and WHEN physiologically needed. Such compounds are then well adapted to help GABA to activate its GABA(B) receptors, like benzodiazepines favor GABA(A) receptor activation. In this review, the way of action of these molecules will be presented in light of our actual knowledge of the activation mechanism of the GABA(B) receptor. We will then show that, as expected, these molecules have more pronounced in vivo responses and less side effects than pure agonists, offering new potential therapeutic applications for this new class of GABA(B) ligands.", 
    "40": "Sedation is often necessary to optimize care for critically ill children requiring mechanical ventilation. If too light or too deep, however, sedation can cause significant adverse reactions, making it important to assess the degree of sedation and maintain its optimal level. We evaluated the efficacy of the COMFORT scale in assessing optimal sedation in critically ill children requiring mechanical ventilation. We compared 12 month data in 21 patients (intervention group), for whom we used the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) sedation protocol of Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) and the COMFORT scale to maintain optimal sedation, with the data in 20 patients (control group) assessed before using the sedation protocol and the COMPORT scale. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant decreases in the total usage of sedatives and analgesics, the duration of mechanical ventilation (11.0 days vs. 12.5 days) and PICU stay (15.0 days vs. 19.5 days), and the development of withdrawal symptoms (1 case vs. 7 cases). The total duration of sedation (8.0 days vs. 11.5 days) also tended to decrease. These findings suggest that application of protocol-based sedation with the COMPORT scale may benefit children requiring mechanical ventilation.",

Outcome measures included, besides symptoms and side effects rating scales, the subjective scale to investigate cognition in schizophrenia (SSTICS), a computer-assisted cognitive test battery (COGLAB), the sickness impact profile (SIP), the global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale, and the drug attitude inventory (DAI).", 
    "44": "Both olanzapine and quetiapine were equally effective in improving symptom severity and decreasing the neurological side effects. Quetiapine was significantly better tolerated (p=0.002), improved self-rated cognitive dysfunction (p=0.002) and subjects' performance on selected neurocognitive tasks (p=0.01). Olanzapine use was associated with greater symptom stability, fewer drop outs (p=0.01) and frequent metabolic aberrations (p=0.001). The accrued benefits of drug therapy, however, were not reflected as significant gains in daily functioning and quality of life.", 
    "45": "Quetiapine is noted to have specific cognition enhancing properties in schizophrenia that warrants further exploration. The observed clinical and cognitive benefits associated with quetiapine may likely be attributable to its loose binding to, and fast dissociation from the dopamine receptors.

    "46": "Glutamate plays an important role in the psychotomimetic effects of both channel blocking N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and hallucinogenic drugs which activate 5-hydroxytryptamine2A (5-HT2A) receptors. Previous work suggested that activation of non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors mediates the effects of 5-HT-induced excitatory post-synaptic potentials/currents (EPSPs/EPSCs) when recording from layer V pyramidal cells in the rat medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC). However, those effects are mediated by either alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) or kainate receptors of the iGluk5 subtype. To test whether activation of AMPA receptors is sufficient to mediate 5-HT-induced EPSCs, a 2,3-benzodiazepine that selectively blocks AMPA receptors was assessed. This selective AMPA receptor antagonist potently suppressed 5-HT-induced EPSCs. Since phenethylamine hallucinogens induce head shakes by activating 5-HT2A receptors in the mPFC and this action is modulated by glutamate, we also examined whether selective blockade of AMPA receptors would suppress DOI-induced head shakes. As predicted, we found that selective blockade of AMPA receptors suppressed DOI-induced head shakes. Given evidence that activation of AMPA receptors is an important downstream effect for both channel blocking NMDA receptor antagonists and phenethylamine hallucinogens, we also tested multiple doses of DOI with a sub-anesthetic dose of MK-801. Synergistic action between these two classes of psychotomimetic drugs was demonstrated by MK-801 enhancing DOI-induced head shakes and locomotor activity. These findings expand the dependence of both channel blocking NMDA receptor antagonists and phenethylamine hallucinogens on enhancing extracellular glutamate.",

In comparison, subjects with anxiety disorders showed a greater increase in cortisol secretion in the stressful situation, with lowered recuperation capacity. This effect was dose-dependent as a function of anxiety co-morbidity. Persons reporting lifetime major trauma with intrusions exhibited lowered continuous basal cortisol associated with efficient recuperation capacity. Independently of psychopathology, women appeared more reactive to stressful environmental conditions.",

A common pattern of up-regulated diurnal cortisol secretion was observed in anxious subjects with lifetime and current anxiety disorder irrespective of sub-type (generalized anxiety, phobias) suggesting a stable trait and a common \"core\" across disorders. Elderly persons who had experienced trauma with subsequent intrusions showed a distinct pattern with down-regulated activity.", 
    "52": "With the purpose of demonstrating the use of positron emission tomography (PET) and radiolabelled glia markers to indicate regional cerebral damage, we measured with PET in four young multiplex sclerosis (MS) patients in two consecutive measurements the global and regional brain uptake as well as regional distribution and binding potential (BP) of [(11)C]vinpocetine and [(11)C]PK11195. Both ligands showed increased uptake and BP in the regions of local brain damage. However, regional BP values for [(11)C]vinpocetine were markedly higher than those for [(11)C]PK11195. This feature of the former radioligand may be related to its high brain uptake and marked affinity to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding sites (PBBS), characteristic for glia cells. As local brain traumas entail reactive glia accumulation in and around the site of the damage, the present findings may indicate that [(11)C]vinpocetine marks the place or boundaries of local brain damage by binding to the PBBS present in glia cells, which, in turn, accumulate in the region of the damage. The present findings (i) confirm earlier observations with [(11)C]PK11195 as a potential glia marker in PET studies and (ii) support the working hypothesis that [(11)C]vinpocetine is a potentially useful PET marker of regional and global brain damage resulting in glia accumulation locally or globally in the human brain. The comparative analysis of the two ligands indicate that [(11)C]vinpocetine shows a number of characteristics favourable in comparison with [(11)C]PK11195.", 
    "53": "Schizophrenic patients who are treated with antipsychotics, especially second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, manifest an increase in cholesterol and triglycerides as well as other changes associated with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms in several genes that regulate lipid metabolism can influence the levels of these lipids and response to drug treatment. We have investigated in an exploratory study whether polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC3), apolipoprotein A-V gene (ApoA5) and lipoprotein lipase genes influence differential lipid response to treatment with three second generation antipsychotics-olanzapine, clozapine and risperidone-or treatment with a first generation antipsychotic. A total of 189 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were being treated with a single antipsychotic were studied in a cross-sectional study design in which fasting serum cholesterol and triglycerides and selected single-nucleotide polymorphosms (SNPs) in the three lipid metabolism genes were assessed. The treatment with antipsychotic monotherapy makes drug haplotype ascertainment less complex. Our analyses showed several nominally significant drug x gene and drug x haplotype interactions. The rarer C allele or the ApoA5_1131 (T/C) SNP was associated with higher cholesterol levels in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics and lower cholesterol levels in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine. The rarer C allele of the ApoA5_SW19 (G/C) SNP was associated with higher cholesterol in risperidone-treated patients. An ApoA5 CG haplotype was associated with decreased cholesterol in olanzapine- or clozapine-treated patients and higher cholesterol in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics. The presence of the rarer T allele of the ApoC3_1100 (C/T) SNP or the presence of the ApoC3 TG haplotype was associated with decreased triglyceride levels in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine and a nonsignificant trend for increased triglycerides in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics. The presence of the ApoC3 CC haplotype was associated with increased triglycerides in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine. The overall magnitude of the effects was not large. These results provide a potential initial step toward a pharmacogenetic approach to selection of antipsychotic treatment which may help minimize the side effect of increases in serum lipids.",

Paradoxically, patients pretreated with lorazepam even needed more propofol in the early phase of sedation (275+/-39 vs 159+/-37 microg/kg in minutes 5-10, P<.05) and the total amount of ketamine administered was higher in this group as well (15.8+/-1.4 vs 11.3+/-1.2 microg/kg/min, P<.05).

Oral fluid was obtained using a simple device that collects approximately 0.4 mL of oral fluid and dilutes it with 0.8 mL of preservative. The oral fluid sample preparation involves a solid-phase extraction on a Varian Bond Elut cartridge. Quantitation was performed by LC-MS-MS using nordiazepam-d(5) as the internal standard. The extraction efficiency exceeded 83% for all compounds except for 7-aminoclonazepam, which had a recovery of 55%. The limits of quantitation ranged from 0.1 ng/mL to 1.0 ng/mL in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. This method was used to confirm 41 patients that screened positive using the OraSure Technologies Benzodiazepine Intercept MICRO-PLATE Enzyme Immunoassay kit.

Analytes were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring with the deuterated analogues as internal standards, using an atmospheric pressure ionization-electrospray interface. The method was validated by examining specificity, precision, accuracy, linearity, recovery, reproducibility, and detection limits. The limits of detection ranged from 9 pg/mL to 2.29 ng/mL in urine depending on the analyte. The SPE procedure was automated on a RapidTrace workstation to increase analytical throughput, and the results obtained via automated SPE were compared to those obtained by manual SPE to examine carryover effect, precision, accuracy, recovery, and reproducibility.

The objective of this study was to compare product performance in the laboratory and performance in the hands of consumers in the field. Product performance in the laboratory adhered to the protocol defined by the manufacturer. Product performance in the hands of consumers in field settings allowed browsing participants to pipette an aliquot of their own drinks into randomly coded vials containing authentic drugs, or pure water, so as to yield the same concentrations of GHB or ketamine specified in the manufacturer-defined protocol, or blanks. Consumers were to proceed according to the directions printed on the product, and to record their results on a card with a code corresponding with the vial to which they had added an aliquot of their beverage. Diagnostic performance was calculated using two-way analysis. In the laboratory, Drink Safe Technology Version 1.2 reliably detected GHB and ketamine at concentrations specified by the manufacturer's protocol. The reactive color change denoting a positive test for GHB was rapid, but a positive test for ketamine required substantially more time to resolve. Nonetheless, test accuracy following the manufacturer's protocol in the laboratory was 100%. In the field, based on 101 paired-test results recorded by consumers, the test efficiency was 65.1%, sensitivity 50%, and specificity 91.6%. The product performed much better in the laboratory than it did in the hand of consumers in the field. There seems to be considerable potential for consumers to misinterpret a test result.

Agonists of the cholecystokinin receptor B such as the cholecystokinin-4 peptide and pentagastrin increase stress hormones regardless of the occurrence of a panic attack and, thus, seem to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis directly. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil does not increase stress hormones, but this agent does not reliably induce panic attacks.

Four single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in 50 Koreans by direct DNA sequencing. In an additional genotyping using 248 subjects, CYP3A4(*)18 was confirmed as the most frequent coding variant in Koreans at 1.7%, and its frequency was similar to that of Asians, suggesting that CYP3A4(*)18 would be the highest coding variant in Asians. The recombinant CYP3A4.18 protein prepared in baculovirus expression system showed 67.4% lower Vmax and 1.8-fold higher K(m) for midazolam 1'-hydroxylation compared with the wild type. The mean values of Cmax and area under the concentration curve (AUC) in the CYP3A4(*)1/(*)18 and CYP3A5(*)1/(*)3 subjects (n = 8) were 63% and 32% higher than in CYP3A4(*)1/(*)1 and CYP3A5(*)1/(*)3 carriers (n = 8), respectively.

    "85": "Predicting drug-drug interactions requires an assessment of the drug concentration available to the enzyme active site, both in vivo, and within an in vitro incubation. These predictions are confounded when the inhibitor accumulates within the liver, either as a result of active transport processes or intracellular binding (including lysosomal trapping). In theory, hepatocytes should provide a more accurate estimation of inhibitory potency compared with microsomes for those compounds that undergo hepatic accumulation. However, they are not routinely used for Ki determination and there is limited comparative information available. Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare Ki values determined in rat microsomes and freshly isolated hepatocytes using six cytochrome P450 inhibitors (miconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, quinine, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine) with a range of uptake properties (cell-to-medium concentration ratios 4.2-6000). Inhibition studies were performed using four probe substrates for CYP2C, CYP2D, and CYP3A enzymes (tolbutamide and phenytoin, dextromethorphan and midazolam, respectively). Comparison of unbound Ki values (range 0.05-30 microM) showed good agreement between microsomes and hepatocytes for inhibition of 18 pathways of metabolism. In addition to this, there was no relationship between the cell-to-medium concentration ratios (covering over 3 orders of magnitude) and the microsomal to hepatocyte Ki ratio of these inhibitors. These data suggest that the hepatic accumulation of these inhibitors results from intracellular binding rather than the involvement of uptake transporters and indicate that microsomes and hepatocytes appear to be equivalent for determining the inhibitory potency of the six inhibitors investigated in the present study.",

For the mentioned purpose, imidazopyridine and imidazopyrimidine compounds 5-20 were synthesized, and their affinity for PBR was determined. Although some intrinsically fluorescent imidazopyrimidine compounds 12-20 possess good binding affinity, they cannot be used for visualizing PBR due to their unfavorable fluorescence characteristics. Among the imidazopyridine-7-nitrofurazan conjugates 5-11, compound 10 was the most active, and it was found to stain live Ra2 microglial cells effectively. An in vivo biodistribution study carried out on compound 10 showed that this imidazopyridine derivative, injected in the carotid artery, is able to penetrate to liver parenchyma, whereas fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled dextran (FITC-dextran), used as a control dye, hardly penetrated from blood vessels to tissues. On the other hand, as for the distribution to brain, the patterns of staining with 10 and FITC-dextran are similar, indicating that both of them hardly penetrate into the brain because of the existence of the blood-brain barrier. The obtained results indicate that compound 10 represents a new useful fluorescent probe for visualization of activated microglia and PBR.",

The primary cause of death was suicide (84.5%), followed by accidents (7%) and homicide (1%). In the remaining 7.5%, cause of death was undetermined. In the suicides, there was evidence of psychotropic medicines in 57% of the observations, with a much higher proportion of benzodiazepines and antidepressants in women than in men. Quantitative toxicologic analysis showed overdosing on medication in 16 suicide victims, with toxic levels in 11 of these. Systematic qualitative and quantitative toxicologic analysis made a significant contribution to the diagnosis of suicide by revealing either an unknown psychiatric treatment or a toxic level.", 
    "93": "Glucose-induced insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells relies largely on glucose metabolism and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Inhibiting the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (mNCE) using 7-Chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one (CGP-37157) has been suggested to enhance ATP synthesis and insulin secretion from rat islets by promoting mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation. In this study we examined the effects of CGP-37157 on human and mouse islet cells. Surprisingly, we found that insulin secretion from perifused islets was reduced by CGP-37157. Cytosolic Ca(2+) measurements revealed that CGP-37157 dose-dependently blocked glucose- and KCl-stimulated Ca(2+) signals in both human and mouse beta-cells. Conversely, CGP-37157 induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization, NAD(P)H rises, and triggered diazoxide- and nifedipine-sensitive cytosolic Ca(2+) transients in a subset of quiescent cells bathed in sub-stimulatory glucose, which is in accord with metabolic activation by the compound. Hence, while blocking mNCE with CGP-37157 may augment metabolism of human and mouse beta-cells, the propagation of metabolic signals is hampered by simultaneous inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx, and ultimately insulin secretion. Efforts to use CGP-37157 or design related compounds for therapeutic purposes should take these competing effects into account.", 
    "94": "Four different oral lorazepam tablets (Tavor tablets as reference preparation and three generic tablet formulations, A, B and C) were investigated after administration to 12 rabbits to evaluate their bioequivalence. A single 2 mg/kg dose was administered orally as powder and lorazepam plasma concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC method. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax), of 207 ng/ml (reference), 198 ng/ml (A), 166 ng/ml (B) and 169 ng/ml (C) were achieved. Lorazepam appeared in the plasma at 0.66 h (Tmax) for all formulations, probably because the disintegration step was bypassed due to the pulverization of the administered doses. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-infinity)) were determined. The obtained AUC(0-t) values were 556.57 ng h/ml (reference), 554.70 ng h/ml (A), 493.08 ng h/ml (B), and 487.88 ng h/ml (C). ANOVA results (P > or = 0.05) and 90% confidence intervals for the mean ratio (T/R) of AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), and Cmax were within the EMEA acceptance range. Pharmacokinetic and statistical results of this study show that the four tested drug products (Tavor, A, B, C) are to be considered bioequivalent and interchangeable in medical practice.", 
    "95": "Opisthotonus is a relatively rare, but challenging neurological symptom of spasticity or dystonia that most often results from a dramatic event such as near-drowning. The classic treatment option for opisthotonus is the oral administration of medication such as benzodiazepines and baclofen. However, results with these medications are usually not very beneficial. Numerous studies however have shown that intrathecal treatment with baclofen (ITB) is an efficient and safe treatment for generalized therapy-resistant spasticity, even in children. In this retrospective study, we describe 11 children (mean age 9 years) with pronounced opisthotonus and quadriplegia caused by different types of acquired lesions who were treated with intrathecal baclofen. Results show that in addition to an expected decrease in muscle tonus, there was also a clear improvement in patient comfort and nursing. A remarkable weight gain was observed in most patients, even when calorie intake did not change. This increase in weight might be due to a reduction in energy expenditure as a result of the decrease in spasticity. Intrathecal treatment with baclofen should be considered in every child with opisthotonus.",

Gallbladder epithelial cells (GBEC) cultured under standard conditions exhibited no beta-Gal activity. beta-Gal expression was prominent in 50% of cells cultured under experimental conditions. Similar morphological changes were observed in GBEC from green fluorescent protein transgenic mice cultured under experimental conditions. These cells showed higher levels of mRNA for genes expressed in hepatocytes, but not in GBEC, including aldolase B, albumin, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, and glutamine synthetase, and they synthesized bile acids. Additional functional evidence of a hepatocyte-like phenotype included LDL uptake and enhanced benzodiazepine metabolism. Connexin-32 expression was evident in murine hepatocytes and in cells cultured under experimental conditions, but not in cells cultured under standard conditions. Notch 1, 2, and 3 and Notch ligand Jagged 1 mRNAs were downregulated in these cells compared with cells cultured under standard conditions.

    "113": "Alcohol dependence is a chronic, relapsing biobehavioral disease mediated by various parts of the brain, including reward systems, memory circuits, and the prefrontal cortex. It is characterized by loss of the ability to drink alcohol in moderation and continued drinking despite negative consequences. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is a common but not universal diagnostic feature of alcohol dependence. Benzodiazepine detoxification of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome prevents the development of withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens, and makes patients more comfortable, which promotes engagement in treatment. Symptom-triggered dosing, based on a withdrawal rating scale such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised, is optimal for minimizing the total benzodiazepine dosage. Use of a long-acting benzodiazepine (eg, chlordiazepoxide) is preferred in uncomplicated patients. Thiamine should be administered routinely before the administration of intravenous fluids to prevent the development of Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In combination with psychosocial treatment, disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate can reduce the frequency of relapse. Naltrexone may be more effective for reduction of loss of control with the first drink and cue-related craving, and acamprosate may be more effective for stabilizing the physiology of post-acute withdrawal. Disulfiram, an aversive deterrent, can be useful if administration can be monitored and tied to meaningful contingencies or when used prophylactically for situations anticipated to carry high risk of relapse. Psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression, is common and is best addressed concurrently, although definitive diagnosis may have to await a period of prolonged sobriety. Prescription of addictive substances, including benzodiazepines beyond the period of acute detoxification, should be avoided, and if necessary should be closely monitored (eg, by frequent visits with small prescriptions, clinic-administered disulfiram, and/or urine or breath alcohol screenings). Abstinence from alcohol is recommended for persons with alcohol dependence. Psychosocial treatment and participation in Alcoholics Anonymous can help patients achieve and maintain abstinence.",

Recent guideline revisions have classified chemotherapeutic agents into four categories of emesis risk without the use of preventive agents: high (> 90%), moderate (30%--90%), low (10%-30%), and minimal (< 10%). Currently available antiemetic agents, including corticosteroids, 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)3 receptor antagonists, and neurokinin (NK)-1 antagonists are used alone or in combination depending on the level of emetogenic potential as prophylaxis against the development of CINVduring the acute period (up to 24 hours after chemotherapy) and the delayed period (up to 5 days after treatment). Newer agents, including the second-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist palonosetron (Aloxi) and the NK-1 antagonist aprepitant (Emend), offer additional clinical benefit in highly and moderately emetogenic therapy. However, delayed nausea and vomiting continue to occur frequently in many patients and have an impact on quality of life.

Patients who have taken an older enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug for years may have a markedly induced hepatic enzyme system that may alter drug metabolism. Overdose or toxicity may occur in older adults who may metabolize and clear antiepileptic drugs more slowly than younger patients.

Using the standardized hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique we compared whole body insulin sensitivity of 29 healthy male volunteers after oral intake of either olanzapine 10 mg/day (n = 14) or ziprasidone 80 mg/day (n = 15) for 10 days. A significant decrease (p<0.001) in whole body insulin sensitivity from 5.7 ml/h/kg ( = mean, SM = 0.4 ml/h/kg) at baseline to 4.7 ml/h/kg ( = mean, SM = 0.3 ml/h/kg) after oral intake of olanzapine (10 mg/day) for 10 days was observed. The ziprasidone (80 mg/day) group did not show any significant difference (5.2+/-0.3 ml/h/kg baseline vs 5.1+/-0.3 ml/h/kg) after 10 days of oral intake. Our main finding demonstrates that oral administration of olanzapine but not ziprasidone leads to a decrease in whole body insulin sensitivity in response to a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic challenge.

Seven minutes after intravenous administration of 10 mg diazepam under continuous EEG recording, a suppression of the epileptiform discharges over the right occipital was seen, while the headache subsided 3 min later. After precise questioning about the circumstances that possibly could have led to these events, it appeared that she had played for hours with a play station on the new color TV and she had visited an exhibition of Matisse and Bonnard with bright colors and contrast-rich text. Standardized extensive intermittent photic stimulation (IPS), 2 days after the status migrainosus, evoked besides asymmetrical right-sided driving, green spots in her left visual field, while in the EEG sharp waves were recorded over the right parietotemporal region. After further IPS with 20 Hz (eye closure), she started complaining of a light pulsating headache right occipitally and in the EEG right parietotemporal sharp-waves were seen.

    "148": "AMPA receptors are fast ligand-gated members of glutamate receptors in neuronal and many types of non-neuronal cells. The heterotetramer complexes are assembled from four subunits (GluR1-4) in region-, development- and function-selective patterns. Each subunit contains three extracellular domains (a large amino terminal domain, an agonist-binding domain and a transducer domain), and three transmembrane segments with a loop (pore forming domain), as well as the intracellular carboxy terminal tail (traffic and conductance regulatory domain). The binding of the agonist (excitatory amino acids and their derivatives) initiates conformational realignments, which transmit to the transducer domain and membrane spanning segments to gate the channel permeable to Na+, K+ and more or less to Ca2+. Several 2,3-benzodiazepines act as non-competitive antagonists of the AMPA receptor (termed also negative allosteric modulators), which are thought to bind to the transducer domains and inhibit channel gating. Analysing their effects in vitro, it has been possible to recognize a structure-activity relationship, and to describe the critical parts of the molecules involved in their action at AMPA receptors. Blockade of AMPA receptors can protect the brain from apoptotic and necrotic cell death by preventing neuronal excitotoxicity during pathophysiological activation of glutamatergic neurons. Animal experiments provided evidence for the potential usefulness of non-competitive AMPA antagonists in the treatment of human ischemic and neurodegenerative disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, periventricular leukomalacia and motoneuron disease. 2,3-benzodiazepine AMPA antagonists can protect against seizures, decrease levodopa-induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson's disease demonstrating their utility for the treatment of a variety of CNS disorders.",

    "150": "After 3 years of sustained remission with medication in a naturalistic setting, 168 patients were continued on, whereas 37 successfully discontinued from medication. Continued and discontinued groups were followed for an additional 4 to 8 years and compared for differences in treatment outcome using chi(2) and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Times to relapse were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, and risk factors for relapse were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.", 
    "151": "The discontinued group was healthier at baseline but had a significantly worse outcome compared with the continued group. Panic-free survival probabilities for the continued group at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 0.87, 0.81, 0.71, and 0.64, respectively, and were significantly higher than respective probabilities of 0.53, 0.35, 0.29, and 0.15 for the discontinued group. Median survival time in the continued group was significantly longer, at 5.67 years, than in the discontinued group, at 1.17 years. Cognitive behavioral therapy significantly reduced hazard in the discontinued but not in the continued group. Residual symptoms in either group at time of assignment predicted poorer outcome.", 
    "152": "Our small study suggests that relapse of panic disorder in routine clinical practice occurs even after long-standing remission on maintenance medication, and that relapse risk appears to be markedly higher after medication discontinuation.

The second mean 21-HAM-D score was lower than the first (11.8+/-8.4 versus 17.4+/-6.2, p<0.0005). Benzodiazepine (BDZ) abuse was lower although not significantly (p=0.06) during the month preceding the second analysis (32/63, 50.8%) than the month preceding the first one (40/63, 63.5%). Psychotropic medication usage was higher at the second assessment than at the first one (50/63, 79.4% versus 27/63, 42.9%, p<0.0005). 21-HAM-D score reduced significantly over time among 13 \"no psychotropic medication\" patients (13.5+/-6.3 versus 6.8+/-6.8, p=0.005) and in 27 who started medication following the first assessment (19.3+/-3.8 versus 11.0+/-8.4, p<0.0005), but not in those who were already taking any medication before the first assessment (17.7+/-7.0 versus 15.0+/-8.0, p=n.s). 21-HAM-D score reduced in all BDZ groups but scores were still highest in the 32 patients who continued BDZ abuse (19.4+/-5.6 versus 15.2+/-7.7) followed by 14 who stopped it (16.8+/-6.4 versus 9.6+/-9.1) and were lowest in 17 patients who never abused BDZ (14.2+/-5.2 versus 7.2+/-6.4) (repeated measured, time and group effect, each p<0.0005). Predictors for being depressed at follow-up were pre-existing depression only. Stopping BDZ abuse and starting psychotropic treatment was associated with a reduction of depressive symptoms among MMT patients.", 
    "154": "The advent of automated locomotor activity methodologies has been extremely useful in removing the subjectivity and bias out of measuring this parameter in rodents. However, many of these behavioural studies are still conducted in novel environments, rather than in ones that the animals are familiar with, such as their home cage. The purpose of the present series of experiments was to develop an automated home cage tracking (HCT) profile using EthoVision software and assessing the acute effects of stimulant (amphetamine and methamphetamine, 0-5 mg/kg, sc) and sedative (diazepam, 0-20 mg/kg, sc and chlordiazepoxide, 0-50 mg/kg sc) drugs in this apparatus. Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and the home cage locomotor activity was recorded for 11-60 min following administration (n=4 per group). For amphetamine and methamphetamine, a dose-dependent increase in home cage activity was evident for both drugs, with a plateau, followed by reduction at higher doses. Methamphetamine was more potent, whereas amphetamine produced greater maximal responses. Both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide dose-dependently reduced locomotor activity, with diazepam exhibiting a greater potency and having stronger sedative effects than chlordiazepoxide. Three doses of each drug were selected at the 31-40 min time period following administration, and compared to open field responses. Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and amphetamine did not produce significant changes in the open field, whilst methamphetamine produced a significant increase in the 2.5 mg/kg group. In conclusion, these studies have successfully developed a sensitive HCT methodology that has been validated using drugs with stimulant and sedative properties in the same test conditions, with relatively small numbers of animals required to produce statistically significant results. It has proven superior to the open field investigations in allowing dose-response effects to be observed over a relatively short observation period (i.e. 10 min) for both stimulants and sedatives. In addition, the HCT system can determine differences in potency and efficacy between drugs of a similar chemical class.",

    "156": "We examined efficacy in randomised trials of bipolar disorder where the presenting episode was either depression, or manic/mixed, comparing atypical antipsychotic with placebo or active comparator, examined withdrawals for any cause, or due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, and combined all phases for adverse event analysis. Studies were found through systematic search (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), and data combined for analysis where there was clinical homogeneity, with a special reference to trial duration.", 
    "157": "In five trials (2,206 patients) participants presented with a depressive episode, and in 25 trials (6,174 patients) the presenting episode was manic or mixed. In 8-week studies presenting with depression, quetiapine and olanzapine produced significantly better rates of response and symptomatic remission than placebo, with NNTs of 5-6, but more adverse event withdrawals (NNH 12). With mania or mixed presentation atypical antipsychotics produced significantly better rates of response and symptomatic remission than placebo, with NNTs of about 5 up to six weeks, and 4 at 6-12 weeks, but more adverse event withdrawals (NNH of about 22) in studies of 6-12 weeks. In comparisons with established treatments, atypical antipsychotics had similar efficacy, but significantly fewer adverse event withdrawals (NNT to prevent one withdrawal about 10). In maintenance trials atypical antipsychotics had significantly fewer relapses to depression or mania than placebo or active comparator. In placebo-controlled trials, atypical antipsychotics were associated with higher rates of weight gain of >or=7% (mainly olanzapine trials), somnolence, and extrapyramidal symptoms. In active controlled trials, atypical antipsychotics were associated with lower rates of extrapyramidal symptoms, but higher rates of weight gain and somnolence.", 
    "158": "Atypical antipsychotics are effective in treating both phases of bipolar disorder compared with placebo, and as effective as established drug therapies. Atypical antipsychotics produce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms, but weight gain is more common (with olanzapine).

    "159": "In situ conversion of bacteriochlorophyll-a, present in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Rb. sphaeroides) gave bacteriopurpurin-18 in modest yield, which in a sequence of reactions was converted into two series of bacteriochlorins: bacteriopurpurinimide and bacteriopurpurin p6 with and without a fused imide ring system, respectively. To determine the effect of overall lipophilicity in photosensitizing efficacy, these bacteriochlorins were independently reacted with HBr gas and subsequently treated with various alkyl alcohols to afford the corresponding alkyl ether derivatives as diastereomeric mixtures (the R- and S-isomers were obtained in almost equal ratios). Between the two series of bacteriochlorins, the bacteriopurpurinimides containing a fused imide ring system were found to be more effective in vivo (C3H mice bearing RIF tumors). To investigate the effect of the presence of the chiral center at position 3 of the most effective purpurinimide 9 [3(1'-heptyloxy)ethyl-3-deacetyl-bacteriopurpurin-18-N-hexylimide propyl ester], the acetyl group was replaced with a hydroxymethyl substituent and converted into 3(1'-decyloxy)methyl-3-deacetyl-purpurin-18-N-hexylimide methyl ester 26 with a similar lipophilicity. Interestingly, compared to 26, the bacteriopurpurinimide 9 was found to be more effective, suggesting that the chiral center at position 3 certainly plays an important role in photosensitizing activity. Among a series of alkyl ether analogues, between the PDT efficacy and the lipophilicity (log P and log D) calculated by computational methods (PALLAS program), a parabolic relationship was observed to some extent. However, it was limited to a particular series, e.g., compounds with similar log P values between bacteriopurpurinimides and bacteriochlorin e6 did not produce similar in vivo efficacy. As expected, within a series, a linear relationship was observed between the log P values and the HPLC retention times of the photosensitizers. Some of the mitochondrial localized photosensitizers showed a significant peripheral benzodiazepine binding (PBR) affinity. However, limited correlation between PBR binding affinity and in vivo PDT efficacy was observed. Compared to the naturally occurring bacteriochlorophyll-a, the bacteriopurpurinimides with fused imide ring system showed higher in vitro/in vivo stability. In contrast to methyl pyropheophorbide-a, the ester functionalities in bacteriopurpurinimide did not convert into the corresponding carboxylic acid by the enzyme esterases.", 
    "160": "The neurosedative and antioxidative properties of some major compounds isolated from a citral chemotype of Lippia alba were investigated. Binding assays were performed on two CNS inhibitory targets: benzodiazepine and GABA(A) receptors. The most active compound was luteolin-7-diglucuronide, with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 101 and 40 microm, respectively. Fifteen compounds isolated from Lippia alba were tested for their radical scavenging capacities against DPPH. Four of the major compounds (verbascoside, calceolarioside E, luteolin-7-diglucuronide and theveside) were also tested for their antioxidant activity against superoxide radical-anion in cell-free (hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase) and cellular (PMA-stimulated neutrophil granulocytes) systems.", 
    "161": "Many adults with epilepsy have breakthrough seizures despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), requiring them to have a rescue medication as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. We evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of rectal diazepam in the treatment of breakthrough seizures in adult patients with epilepsy. We identified 50 such patients who had used diazepam rectal gel for clusters of seizures defined as acute repetitive seizures, prolonged seizures, or both, in the previous 18 months. Information on diagnoses, dose, frequency of use, reasons for use, safety, and efficacy was collected. Diazepam rectal gel was effective in stopping seizures in 45 patients (90%). Somnolence was reported in most patients, but no other adverse events were reported. Diazepam rectal gel demonstrates efficacy and tolerability as a seizure rescue medication for adult patients with a variety of seizure types, and may help improve quality of life.", 
    "162": "Neurosteroids (NS) are recognized as important modulators of functioning of the nervous system. Lindane, an organochlorine pesticide has been shown to adversely affect memory and induce oxidative stress on both acute and chronic exposure. The present study was designed to explore the modulation of effects of lindane over cognitive function by progesterone (PROG), pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S) and 4'-chlorodiazepam (4CD). Cognitive function was assessed using step-down latency (SDL) on a passive avoidance apparatus and transfer latency (TL) on a plus maze. Oxidative stress was assessed by examining brain malondialdehyde (MDA) and non-protein thiol (NP-SH) levels. A significant reduction in SDL was found for the lindane treated group at weeks 6 and 7 as compared to control (p<0.001). One-week treatment by PREG-S or 4CD antagonized the effect of lindane on SDL. PROG failed to modulate the effect of lindane on SDL. Lindane caused a significant prolongation of TL as compared to control (p<0.001) from second week onwards. One-week administration of PROG, PREG-S or 4CD was unable to reverse this prolongation of TL. Lindane produced a statistically significant increase in the brain MDA levels (p<0.001) and significant decrease in the brain NP-SH levels (p<0.001). Treatment with PREG-S and 4CD attenuated the effect of lindane on MDA (p<0.001) and NP-SH levels. PROG failed to influence oxidative stress induced by lindane. Results of the present study thus show that some NS have potential in reversing cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by toxicants like lindane in the brain.",

The differences in scores occurred predominantly in younger patients. The mean propofol requirement was 192 mg in Group A and 131 mg in Group B; the mean difference was 61 mg (95%CI 40-82 mg). Patients reported equivalent levels of satisfaction with both sedation regimens. On multivariate analysis, \"cocktail\" use ( P = 0.013) and increasing age ( P = 0.027) significantly improved patient tolerance during ERCP.

    "167": "Although sleep problems are thought to be prevalent among patients who undergo dialysis, there is only limited information on the determinants of sleep quality and the change in sleep quality during the first year of dialysis treatment. This report uses data from a national cohort study of incident hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients to identify the correlates of sleep quality and to determine the extent to which sleep quality is related to patients' health-related quality of life and survival. This report includes 909 incident dialysis patients who responded to questions about sleep quality. Three quarters of incident dialysis patients reported impaired sleep, and 14% had a decline in sleep quality in the first year of treatment. Poor sleep quality was significantly related to black race, higher serum phosphate, current smoking, benzodiazepine prescription, and complaints of severe restless legs. Poor baseline sleep quality was associated with lower SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores, vitality scores, and bodily pain scores (all P < 0.001). Younger age, current smoking, and benzodiazepine prescription were associated with decreases in sleep quality at 1 yr. There was no association between baseline sleep quality and survival; however, a decline in sleep quality during the first year on dialysis was associated with shorter survival (hazard ratio 1.44; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.83; P = 0.003). Future work should examine the link between sleep quality and daytime functioning in the kidney failure population and the extent to which improving sleep quality will improve dialysis patient outcomes.", 
    "168": "Progressive ratio (PR) schedules of intravenous drug self-administration are useful for establishing the relationships between reinforcing effectiveness and pharmacological actions of abused drugs. The authors compared the reinforcing effects of 2 short-duration benzodiazepine-type drugs differing in their receptor selectivity: zolpidem (selective for gamma aminobutyric acid Type A [GABA(A)] receptors containing alpha1 subunits) and midazolam (nonselective). Reinforcing effectiveness was evaluated using a PR schedule of intravenous drug injection in rhesus monkeys in which the response requirement increased across the experimental session and the initial response requirement (IRR) was varied. Analyses based on consumer demand and labor supply models of behavioral economics revealed that the relative reinforcing effectiveness of zolpidem was greater than that of midazolam. For consumer demand analyses, the degree of difference between zolpidem and midazolam depended on whether price was calculated on the basis of different IRRs or different doses of drug. According to labor supply analysis, the reinforcing effects of midazolam were influenced by the economic concept referred to as a price effect to a greater degree than those of zolpidem. These findings suggest that a compound with selectivity for GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1 subunits has greater reinforcing effectiveness than a nonselective compound with similar pharmacokinetics, albeit under a limited range of conditions (high response costs). Differences in price effects may play a key role in determining the relative reinforcing effectiveness of selective versus nonselective benzodiazepine agonists.", 
    "169": "Due to its channel-like properties, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been renamed the translocator protein (TSPO). In eukaryotes, the TSPO is primarily located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. In prokaryotes, it is found in the cell membrane. A broad spectrum of functions has been attributed to the TSPO, including various host defense responses, developmental processes, and mitochondrial functions. In the present review, we focus on the role of TSPO in immunological responses, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis, to determine whether these functions may be governed by a common denominator including TSPO. At physiological concentrations (nM range), the TSPO specific ligands, PK 11195 and Ro5-4864, appear to be anti-apoptotic. Knockdown of TSPO by genetic manipulation, resulting a reduction by more than 50% in [(3)H]PK 11195 binding, was reported to show anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a potential pro-apoptotic function of TSPO. However, a reduction of more than 70% of TSPO abundance was found to cause cell death, possibly due to impairment of other essential cell functions. The pro-apoptotic function of TSPO may involve the modulation of the channel formed by the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) [i.e., the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)]. The frequently reported pro-apoptotic effects of PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 may be due to sites with low-affinity binding for these specific TSPO ligands, and not directly related to VDAC and ANT. Also at concentrations in the nM range, PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 appear to stimulate steroidogenesis. For this function TSPO by itself appears to suffice i.e. no involvement of VDAC and ANT. TSPO appears to operate as a translocator/channel to transfer cholesterol into mitochondria where it is converted to pregnenolone, a precursor of further steroidogenesis. Apoptosis and steroids play important roles in various aspects of the host defense response. Thus, our review suggests that the involvement of TSPO and its ligands in such seemingly disparate biological functions as immunological responses, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis may have a common denominator in the multi-dimensional role of TSPO in the host-defense response to disease and injury.",

Hops drying and preparation of extracts were performed according to standard pharmacological procedures for preparing total alcoholic extracts of medicinal plants, i.e. in a ratio of one part dry herbs to two parts of 70% alcohol, with evaporation to dryness so that the extracts no longer contained any alcohol. The mice received four doses intraperitoneally (i.p.) of 0.5% aqueous solutions of the above-mentioned extracts, which were dissolved in warm physiological solution to make up a 0.5% aqueous solution, 24, 16, 4 and 0.5 hours before pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) or diazepam (3 mg/kg) administration. The hypnotic action of pentobarbital and the effect of diazepam on the coordination of movements (rotating rod method) were measured. It was found that hops extracts influenced the action of the investigated drugs, and that the extracts of the Magnum and Aroma genotypes suppressed the hypnotic action of pentobarbital and diazepam. Tert-butanolic extracts also suppressed the action of these two drugs but to a lesser extent, whereas wild hops extracts did not exert any significant effects compared to controls.",

These risk factors included dementia (odds ratio [OR], 6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-13.8), receipt of benzodiazepines before ICU admission (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6-7.0), elevated creatinine level (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.0), and low arterial pH (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9). The C statistic was 0.78.", 
    "198": "Delirium is frequent among older ICU patients. Admission characteristics can be important markers for delirium in these patients. Knowledge of these admission risk factors can prompt early correction of metabolic abnormalities and may subsequently reduce delirium duration."
