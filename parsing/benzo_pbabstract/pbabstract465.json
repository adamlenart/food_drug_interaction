    "0": "A randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed with three different acute oral dosages of CM 40907 (3-(4-hydroxypiperidyl)-6-(2'-chlorophenyl)-pyridazine) (600, 900 and 1200 mg), a newly developed anticonvulsant drug, vs acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 1000 mg) and placebo in 12 male healthy volunteers to check analgesic potency. Objective algesimetry was done by Laser Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (LSEP). Subjective pain intensities were measured by retrospective visual analog scale ratings (VAS). Effects on objective vigilance were checked by Auditory Evoked Potentials (AEP). For both types of evoked potentials there was a simultaneous control of alterations in vigilance by means of the adaptive pursuit tracking task (APTT). A vigilance-controlled EEG (V-EEG) and a resting (R-EEG), visual analog scales (VAS) on sedation, excitation and anxiety as well as vital parameters (blood pressure and heart rate under supine and upright conditions) and adverse event scales were included in this trial as well. CM 40907 showed distinct analgesic effects on objective and subjective algesimetric parameters, which for the highest dosage (1200 mg) were superior in (\"central\") P2-amplitude suppression of LSEPs to those of ASA in (\"peripheral\") N1-amplitudes suppression and ongoing for more than 6 h. Subjective sedation was decreased, however, AEP-findings indicated a decreased vigilance after CM 40907. Some EEG-patterns, specifically related with CM 40907--although being ambiguous in classification terms--resembled features of benzodiazepines. Blood pressure and heart rate were raised in a clinically irrelevant manner.", 
    "1": "The protective effects of simultaneous and continuous administration of physostigmine and trihexyphenidyl against soman-induced toxicity were studied in guinea pigs. Not only did trihexyphenidyl reduce physostigmine-induced toxicity when it was administered continuously to the animals along with physostigmine, the combination afforded greater protection from soman lethality than did either agent administered alone. The combination pretreatment also gave better protection against soman-induced body weight loss and decreased water consumption and attenuated the down-regulation of cholinergic receptors which occurred when physostigmine alone was used. The onsets of other soman-induced toxicity signs were delayed significantly by the combination pretreatment regimen. These results suggest that simultaneous administration of the combination of physostigmine and trihexyphenidyl may be more useful than physostigmine alone as prophylaxis against soman poisoning.", 
    "2": "1. Convulsive thresholds were measured with intravenous pentylenetetrazol in mice during the recovery phase after intravenous anaesthetic doses of propofol (10 and 20 mg kg-1), thiopentone (30 mg kg-1), methohexitone (10 mg kg-1), and etomidate 3 mg kg-1). 2. The convulsive threshold rose after each agent, indicating an anticonvulsant action for all the drugs tested; this declined to control values with initial half times of: 1.56 min (propofol 10 mg kg-1); 1.03 min (propofol 20 mg kg-1): 1.02 min (methohexitone); 3.35 min (etomidate); 13.7 min (thiopentone). 3. At no time during the recovery phase of any agent did the convulsive threshold fall below control values, which might indicate an epileptogenic effect of the drug. 4. The threshold was depressed below control values by intravenous administration of Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, thus indicating the ability of this pentylenetetrazol test to demonstrate a proconvulsant effect. 5. We conclude that the abnormal movements or convulsions associated with recovery from anaesthesia with short-acting intravenous anaesthetics may not be the result of an intrinsic proconvulsant action of the drugs.", 
    "3": "Rapid withdrawal of short to intermediate half-life benzodiazepines may be hazardous, particularly in the elderly. The use of carbamazepine to facilitate withdrawal has been reported in younger patients. We describe four elderly patients (average age, 72.5 years) who had each experienced at least one unsuccessful attempt at alprazolam withdrawal and who were subsequently successfully withdrawn via the use of carbamazepine over a period ranging from 2 to 6 days. These geriatric patients experienced no major withdrawal symptoms, but mild symptoms were common. There was no correlation between dose or duration of alprazolam use and extent of withdrawal symptoms. We recommend use of this treatment regimen in a hospital setting only, where close monitoring can occur.", 
    "4": "The relevance of EEG effect parameters as a measure of pharmacological effect intensity of benzodiazepines was evaluated. The concentration-EEG effect relationships of four benzodiazepine agonists, flunitrazepam, midazolam, oxazepam and clobazam, were quantified in individual rats and correlated with receptor affinity and anticonvulsant effect intensity of these compounds. Male Wistar-derived rats received a single i.v. dose of flunitrazepam (2.5 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg), oxazepam (10 mg/kg) and clobazam (20 mg/kg). Arterial blood samples were drawn frequently and EEG was monitored continuously until it had returned to preadministration levels. The concentrations of the benzodiazepines were determined by chromatographic means. Plasma protein binding was determined at 37 degrees C by ultrafiltration. The amplitudes in the 11.5 to 30 Hz frequency range, determined by aperiodic analysis, was used as EEG effect measure. Concentration-EEG effect relationships were derived by a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling procedure and characterized by the sigmoidal Emax model. The EC50 based on free drug concentrations (EC50,U, mean +/- S.E.) calculated for flunitrazepam (4.2 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) and midazolam (3.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) were similar and significantly less than the values for oxazepam (49 +/- 4 ng/ml) and clobazam (277 +/- 34 ng/ml) and illustrates the importance of using parameters referenced to unbound drug for comparative purposes. The maximal responses (Emax) for midazolam, oxazepam and clobazam were significantly less than for flunitrazepam suggesting that these three drugs may be regarded as partial agonists when compared to flunitrazepam. Receptor affinity was determined based on displacement of [3H] flumazenil in a washed brain homogenate at 37 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Usefulness of alprazolam for control of chemotherapy-induced emesis including 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of cisplatin for advanced lung cancer was evaluated by a randomized crossover design. Of 22 cases evaluated, 8 in the alprazolam group and 1 in the untreated group were free from nausea and vomiting (p less than 0.01). The mean frequency of vomiting in the alprazolam group was 1.18 times, which is significantly smaller than 2.25 times in the untreated group (p less than 0.05). The mean duration of vomiting and nausea was significantly shorter in the alprazolam group (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05). It is thus concluded that concomitant therapy with the minor tranquilizer alprazolam is useful in treating cisplatin-induced acute or delayed emesis in which psychological and psychiatric factors are involved.", 
    "6": "The irreversible protein-modifying reagent N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) was used to investigate binding site characteristics on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex. In vitro, preincubation with EEDQ led to a concentration-dependent decrease in receptor number for benzodiazepine, t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), and GABA binding sites in cerebral cortex. The effect was maximal at the highest concentration of EEDQ used (10(-4) M) and was greatest for the benzodiazepine site. Pretreatment of membranes with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, 1 or 10 microM, or the agonist lorazepam, 10 microM, largely prevented the effects of EEDQ. Scatchard analysis indicated no effect of EEDQ, 10(-4) M, on apparent affinity, but a decrease in receptor density for each site. Administration of EEDQ to mice, 12.5 mg/kg i.p., led to a substantial (55-65%) decrease in number of benzodiazepine binding sites in cortex after 4 h. Slightly smaller changes were observed for TBPS and GABA binding. No changes were observed in apparent affinity at any site. Prior administration of Ro 15-1788, 5 mg/kg, prevented the effect of EEDQ on benzodiazepine binding. Density of benzodiazepine binding sites gradually recovered over time, and receptor density returned to control values by 96 h after EEDQ injection. Number of binding sites in cortex for TBPS and GABA also increased over time after EEDQ. Benzodiazepine sites in cerebellum were decreased proportionally to cortex after EEDQ, and increased over a similar time course. Function of the GABAA receptor in chloride uptake in cortex was markedly reduced (65%) by EEDQ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Aseptic meningitis after lumbar puncture and spinal anesthesia is a rare but serious complication, whose acute onset and clinical symptoms mimic septic meningitis. A 33 year old woman presented this complication 5 h after an uneventful cesarean section under subarachnoid blockade. Though lumbar puncture revealed pleocytosis with negative Gram stains and cultures, she was treated with antibiotics and made a full recovery. The clinical picture, differential diagnosis and value of early lumbar puncture are discussed. The successful use of midazolam to treat psychomotor agitation in this patient is also reported.", 
    "8": "Benzodiazepines have so many uses in cancer patients that the physician may target more than one advantage as he considers choice of drug and dose. Nausea, pain, and anxiety may be treated simultaneously. Since these patients are often taking a number of medications, the simplest regimen has the most benefit. These drugs treat reactive anxiety, insomnia, claustrophobia, and panic disorder. As they treat anticipatory anxiety and phobia, they mitigate anticipatory nausea and a component of post-treatment nausea. With chemotherapy itself, they cause sedation, suppress recall of treatment, limit vomiting, and are seen as desirable by patients. They suppress the restlessness associated with metoclopramide and other dopamine-antagonist antiemetics. The analgesic effects are best seen in conditions of high anxiety, muscle spasm, and deafferentation syndromes. The advantages of sedative and antipsychotic effects may be exploited to suppress the psychiatric complications of high-dose corticosteroids.", 
    "9": "The solubilities of five poorly water-soluble drugs, diazepam, griseofulvin, progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, and testosterone, were studied in the presence of nicotinamide. All solubilities were found to increase in a nonlinear fashion as a function of nicotinamide concentration. The K1:1 and K1:2 stability constants were as follows: for diazepam, K1:1 = 5.23 M-1 and K1:2 = 8.6 M-2; for griseofulvin, K1:1 = 5.54 M-1 and K1:2 = 8.82 M-2; for progesterone, K1:1 = 5.48 M-1 and K1:2 = 42.47 M-2; for 17 beta-estradiol, K1:1 = 5.38 M-1 and K1:2 = 36.9 M-2; and for testosterone, K1:1 = 5.07 M-1 and K1:2 = 27.47 M-2. Two aliphatic analogues of nicotinamide (nipecotamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide) were studied as ligands with diazepam and griseofulvin and were found to increase the solubilities of both drugs in a linear fashion. The aromatic analogue, N,N-diethylnicotinamide, showed a nonlinear solubilization relationship similar to that seen with nicotinamide. In addition, three other aromatic analogues (isonicotinamide, 1-methylnicotinamide iodide, and N-methylnicotinamide) were studied. These ligands were not soluble enough in water to be studied over the wide range of concentrations used for nicotinamide and N,N-diethylnicotinamide; however, in the concentration range studied, these ligands solubilized diazepam and griseofulvin to a degree similar to that observed with comparable concentrations of nicotinamide. These results suggest that the aromaticity (Pi-system) of the pyridine ring is an important factor in complexation because the aromatic amide ligands were found to enhance the aqueous solubilities of the test drugs to a greater extent than the aliphatic amide ligands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "We evaluated the efficacy of a computer-assisted continuous infusion device (CACI) using a two-drug infusion of midazolam and sufentanil as an anesthetic technique during pediatric cardiac surgery. Seventeen pediatric patients were anesthetized with CACI using age-appropriate pharmacokinetic models for administering sufentanil and midazolam. Predicted CACI plasma concentrations were correlated with assayed plasma drug concentrations at eight predefined intervals. The accuracy was assessed using median absolute prediction error. We found that plasma levels predicted by CACI provided a reasonable approximation of measured plasma concentrations for both drugs. The median absolute prediction error for sufentanil during cardiopulmonary bypass was compared with measurements made off of cardiopulmonary bypass (both pre and post cardiopulmonary bypass) and were 49% and 32%, respectively, and for midazolam 44% and 32%, respectively. We conclude that (a) current kinetic models provide a reasonable estimate of plasma drug concentrations, and (b) the ease of administration and targeted plasma level provided by the CACI system is an alternative to inhalation anesthesia using calibrated vaporizers.", 
    "11": "Long-term behavioral effects of a low dose of diazepam (1 mg/kg body weight) or chlorpromazine (2.5 mg/kg) administered 2-3 times during the last week of pregnancy i.m. were studied in Wistar rats and compared with sequelae of analogously applied saline as well as with normal ontogeny in controls. Inhibitory learning-and-memory ontogeny was assessed by 3 types of passive avoidance (PA) at 3 different life periods: neonatal, 2 months, 4 months. Also were investigated: development of righting, air righting, hanging on a thin horizontal bar, eye-lid opening, somatic development and mortality. Prenatal application of diazepam had adverse effects in all parameters except of eye-lid opening. The reflex and motor development was retarded, and so was body weight. The high mortality in the diazepam treated progeny was due to increased death rate in males. In all PA paradigms investigated no memory was established in rats given diazepam prenatally. Chlorpromazine exhibited a lesser effect. I.m. saline had doubtless a character of prenatal-stress. The impact of diazepam was therefore the result of its proper action and only of a partial, if any, after-effect of prenatal stressful manipulation of the dam.", 
    "12": "1. McNeil A 343 (10 microM-30 microM) enhanced the fractional stimulation-induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity from mouse isolated atria which had been incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline. The enhancing effect of McNeil A 343 was not altered by hexamethonium (300 microM) suggesting that it was not due to an action at nicotinic receptors. It is also unlikely that McNeil A 343 enhanced the S-I outflow of radioactivity in mouse atria by blocking neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline since the effect persisted in the presence of cocaine (30 microM). 2. The facilitatory effect of McNeil A 343 on the S-I outflow of radioactivity was attenuated by atropine (0.3 microM), pirenzepine (0.2 microM or 1.0 microM), dicyclomine (1.0 microM) and methoctramine (1.0 microM) and was thus due to activation of muscarinic receptors. 3. In contrast to the effect of McNeil A 343, another muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol (3.0 microM) significantly decreased the S-I outflow of radioactivity. The receptors through which McNeil A 343 acts to enhance the S-I outflow of radioactivity appear to be distinct from inhibitory prejunctional muscarinic receptors. The relatively M 1-selective antagonist, pirenzepine (0.2 microM), attenuated the facilitatory effect of McNeil A 343 whereas a higher concentration (1.0 microM) was required to block the inhibitory effect of carbachol. Conversely, the relatively M2-selective antagonist, methoctramine (0.1 microM), blocked the inhibitory effect of carbachol but a higher concentration of methoctramine (1.0 microM) was required to block the facilitatory effects of McNeil A 343. These results tentatively ascribe facilitatory muscarinic receptors as belonging to the Ml subtype and inhibitory muscarinic receptors as belonging to the M2 subtype. 4. The non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, enhanced the S-I outflow of radioactivity, suggesting that there was tonic activation of inhibitory prejunctional muscarinic receptors by endogenous acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves. However, pirenzepine (0.03 pM-LO microM) did not decrease the S-I outflow of radioactivity, suggesting that under the conditions of the present study, facilitatory muscarinic receptors are not tonically activated by endogenous acetylcholine.", 
    "13": "In the lateral septal area of spontaneously hypertensive rats, but not in Wistar-Kyoto rats, the selective M1 antagonist, pirenzepine, and the depletion of acetylcholine storage, by hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), decreased blood pressure. The selective M1 agonist McNeil-A-343, produced a pressor response only after treatment of the lateral septal area with HC-3 in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Carbachol, at doses that mainly affect M2 muscarinic receptors, caused no cardiovascular changes in either strain, pointing to the main intervention of the M1 subtype of muscarinic receptor in the hypertensive condition. In addition, increases in the density of binding sites for [3H]QNB and in Vmax of sodium-dependent, HC-3-inhibitable, high affinity uptake of choline were demonstrated, without significant changes of the activity of choline acetyltransferase in the lateral septal area of spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results suggest that a hyperactivity of the cholinergic system of this area could play a role in the development and/or maintenance of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "14": "1. The effect of temperature reduction on the interaction of carbachol (CCh) and McN-A-343 (McN) with muscarinic receptors in the guinea-pig taenia caeci was investigated. 2. McN, a partial agonist, acted on the smooth muscle to produce contraction. The response was unaffected by tetrodotoxin and the pKB for inhibition by pirenzepine was 6.8, indicating that ganglionic M1 receptors were not involved in the response. 3. Reduction in temperature from 37 degrees C to 18 degrees C for 3 h led to a marked reduction in the contractile response to McN (2-200 microM) but no reduction in the response to CCh (0.1-3 microM). 4. The reduction in temperature was not accompanied by any change in the affinity of McN or CCh for muscarine receptors in binding experiments with [3H]-QNB. 5. The KA value for CCh determined after irreversible receptor inactivation with propylbenzilylcholine mustard followed by ca 60-min wash-out was 7.6 microM, a value similar to that obtained in binding experiments. 6. The EC50 for McN in producing contraction at 37 degrees C (2.1 microM) was similar to the KA value for the partial agonist obtained in experiments with the irreversible antagonist phenoxybenzamine (2.5 microM). It was also similar to the KB value determined at 18 degrees C (3.4 microM) when McN could be used as an antagonist of contractions to CCh. 7. At 18 degrees C, phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis by CCh was reduced to 23% of that at 37 degrees C. 8. It is concluded that reduction of muscarinic receptor activation of the PI pathway by cholinomimetics with lowering of the temperature could account for the findings with McN on contractility.", 
    "15": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) has become rare since the widespread use of the measles vaccine. In this patient with a 5 month history of seizures and progressive dementia due to SSPE, the atypical electroencephalographic pattern was characterized by generalized spike-and-wave discharges, maximal on the right, associated with clinical seizures. After diazepam (intravenously), more typical periodic complexes appeared.", 
    "16": "Benzodiazepines (BZD) have been described to interact with specific peripheral-type receptors on phagocytes. The present study demonstrates that pico- to nanomolar concentrations of BZD compounds enhance the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) by human monocytes, as determined by specific immunoreactive and biological assays for these cytokines. BZD remained ineffective in the absence of LPS. The activity of BZD was restricted to peripheral (Ro 5-4864) and mixed (diazepam, Valium) type ligands, while anxiogenic (beta-carbolines) or anxiolytic (clonazepam) central type ligands had no effect. Interestingly, peptide fragments of the endogenous anxiogenic ligand diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), such as octadecaneuropeptide (ODN-DBI) and the octaneuropeptide corresponding to its COOH-terminal sequence, very efficiently modulated the LPS-induced production of both monokines. Similar results were obtained directly within whole blood samples. These results indicate that widely prescribed pharmacological compounds and endogenous anxiety modulators affect molecular mediators of human host defense mechanisms and inflammatory reactions.", 
    "17": "The acoustic startle reflex was modified by presenting gaps (0-30 ms) in a continuous noise (70 dB) before the startle eliciting stimulus. The effects of midazolam (0.4-1.8 mg/kg, IP), DMCM (0.1-0.4 mg/kg, IP), buspirone (5-20 mg/kg, PO), 8-OH-DPAT (0.5-8 mg/kg, IP), and clonidine (0.009-0.08 mg/kg, IP) on startle amplitudes (reflecting sensorimotor reactivity) on the one hand, and on gap inhibition of the startle reflex (a measure of temporal acuity) on the other hand, were investigated. The results showed that midazolam and clonidine attenuated sensorimotor reactivity dose-dependently. DMCM had no systematic effect on sensorimotor reactivity. Buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT increased sensorimotor reactivity dose dependently. Furthermore, midazolam and clonidine did not affect the neuronal systems underlying inhibition of the startle reflex. In contrast, DMCM and buspirone increased inhibition dose-dependently, and 8-OH-DPAT first increased and then decreased inhibition of the startle reflex. The possibility that drug-induced behavior affected the startle reflex was discussed.", 
    "18": "Both abuse and new uses for benzodiazepines are reviewed. The pharmacology of benzodiazepines is summarized and statistics regarding their general use are given. The question of benzodiazepine abuse is reviewed in some detail and the question of rebound, recurrence of symptoms and physiological withdrawal is differentiated. Benzodiazepines are regarded as a very safe class of drugs and the abuse potential is felt to be negligible provided that they are prescribed for appropriate conditions and monitored carefully. The dangers of alternatives to benzodiazepines such as alcohol or barbiturates is emphasized. New uses for benzodiazepines are reviewed including the use of benzodiazepines in panic disorder, as well as an adjunct in the therapy of mania and some psychotic states. Rational prescribing of benzodiazepines is encouraged and the attitude that these are dangerous and addictive drugs is discouraged and put into perspective.", 
    "19": "Using a double-blind procedure, 68 patients with putative benzodiazepine dependence were randomly allocated to one of three groups given lorazepam (n = 22), diazepam (n = 23) or bromazepam (n = 23) in doses equivalent to those of the patients' original benzodiazepine. After four weeks the dosage was reduced in 25% quantities until no further benzodiazepines were taken. A total of 23 patients dropped out during the study, ten on lorazepam (one of whom committed suicide), seven on diazepam and six on bromazepam. There were few differences in withdrawal symptoms between the three groups but, despite the higher dropout rate, these symptoms were somewhat less marked in the lorazepam group. Withdrawal symptoms were greater in patients who had taken a benzodiazepine for greater than 5 years and were most marked in those with personality disorders, predominantly dependent ones.", 
    "20": "Twenty-one patients completed an intensive in-patient and out-patient group-based programme, to achieve withdrawal from long-term benzodiazepine dependence. By 6-month follow-up (post-withdrawal), eight patients (38%) had achieved a 'good' outcome. Generally, patients demonstrated moderate levels of psychiatric morbidity and depression in the pre-withdrawal phase; a diagnosis of a depressive disorder being associated with either an 'intermediate' or 'poor' outcome in comparison to patients receiving a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, who showed a predominantly 'good' outcome. Two patients committed suicide some time after withdrawal. Additionally, older patients fared less well than their younger counterparts. We conclude that maintenance benzodiazepine prescription, rather than withdrawal, may be the preferred treatment for some dependent patients. Furthermore, more data are required regarding the association, and causality, between depression and benzodiazepine withdrawal in long-term users.", 
    "21": "The enforced interval of copulation (EIC) consists of the artificial prolongation of the interintromission interval, induces a reduction in the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation, and is accompanied by an anxiety like behavioral repertoire. The administration of the benzodiazepine anxiolytics diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam, and flunitrazepam produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the EIC effect with a concomitant increase in mounting. These actions were blocked by the central benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. The anxiogenic agent beta-carboline Zk 39106 had no effect. Treatment with pentobarbital also produced a blockade of the reduction in the number of intromissions during EIC, whereas muscimol and bicuculline lacked this effect. The serotonergic anxiolytic buspirone reversed the facilitatory action induced by EIC; however, two putative serotonergic antianxiety agents, 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone, did not modify or potentiate it, respectively. Finally, the nonanxiolytic serotonergic compounds 5-hydroxytryptophan and TFMPP drastically increased the number of mounts but did not antagonize the reduction of intromissions produced by EIC. These results suggest that an increase in the anxiety levels may be responsible for the excitatory action of EIC on sexual behavior.", 
    "22": "One hundred and sixty-nine depressive psychiatric inpatients were treated with routine therapeutic doses of mianserin. Altogether 256 serum mianserin samples were measured gas-chromatographically in 3 age groups: 17 samples in patients under 35 years, 116 samples in patients between 35 and 65 years, and 123 samples in patients over 65 years. No differences in dose-corrected (calculated as mg/kg dose basis) mean serum mianserin concentrations were found between the age classes. Neither the interindividual variation nor the number of high serum mianserin concentrations was larger among elderly subjects than in the other age groups. Concurrent neuroleptic treatment significantly increased serum mianserin levels in the oldest patient group but not in the 2 others. The results suggest that mianserin dose should not be generally reduced with advancing age.", 
    "23": "The present study was undertaken to examine how muscarinic antagonists modify the release of catecholamines evoked by splanchnic nerve stimulation (SNS) from the dog adrenal gland in vivo, in an attempt to elucidate whether muscarinic receptors play a functional role in catecholamine release. Output of epinephrine and norepinephrine was determined from adrenal venous blood by using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. SNS (1 and 3 Hz) produced increases in catecholamine output in a frequency-dependent manner. Intravenous administration of pirenzepine (10-100 micrograms/kg), a selective M1 receptor antagonist, or AF-DX 116 (30-300 micrograms/kg) and gallamine (0.3-3 mg/kg), selective M2 receptor antagonists, did not modify the SNS-induced increases in catecholamine output. C6 (hexamethonium) inhibited the SNS-induced increases in catecholamine output partially in a dose of 1 mg/kg and remarkably in a dose of 10 mg/kg. The combination of C6 (1 mg/kg) with pirenzepine (10 micrograms/kg), AF-DX 116 (30 micrograms/kg) or gallamine (0.3 mg/kg) inhibited the SNS-induced increases in catecholamine output more potently than C6 did by itself. The inhibition by C6 alone was about 50%, but that by each combination reached to about 80%. These results suggest that M2 receptors as well as M1 receptors play a facilitatory role in catecholamine release from the adrenal gland in response to SNS when the nicotinic receptor-mediated mechanism is partially inhibited.", 
    "24": "In a double-blind, prospective study, 2 mg of intramuscular lorazepam and 5 mg of intramuscular haloperidol were equally effective in controlling aggression, agitation, and assaultive behavior. Although lorazepam and haloperidol produced an equivalent mean decrease in aggression, significantly more subjects who received lorazepam had a greater decrease in aggression ratings than haloperidol recipients; this effect was independent of sedation. Lorazepam produced significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms. These data support the current clinical practice of using lorazepam (alone, or in combination with a neuroleptic) for control of acute aggressive and assaultive behavior.", 
    "25": "The ability to reliably produce sedation in swine is hampered by the paucity of agents available. This project examined the use of a new water soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, as a sedative in swine. Echocardiographic studies were performed on thirty 23 to 30 kg Yorkshire swine before and 20 minutes after each animal received a single intramuscular dose of 100 micrograms/kg midazolam. Heart rate and respiratory rate decreased significantly compared to nonsedated values (93 +/- 7 versus 117 +/- 2 bpm and 10 +/- 1 versus 20 +/- 1 breaths/min, respectively [p less than 0.05]). However, there was no effect on left ventricular fractional shortening (29.9 greater than 0.05 versus 29.5 +/- 0.05% [p greater than 0.05]). An additional five pigs were instrumented for a dose response study in order to collect hemodynamic data and blood gas values at baseline, and 15 min after the intravenous administration of incremental doses of midazolam (100 to 1,000 micrograms/kg). Despite a significant decrease in heart rate and respiratory rate, cardiac output, blood gases, and pH remained within normal ranges at all dosage levels. Both routes of administration produced sedation for 20 min in all animals. Midazolam is an effective swine sedative that is associated with stable cardiac function.", 
    "26": "Flumazenil is a specific antagonist of the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBZR). Labelled with 11C, this compound is the reference radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) study of the CBZR in humans and primates. The time-course of [11C]-flumazenil radioactivity and its main acid metabolite [11C] Ro 15-3890 were reconstructed from the time-course of total radioactivity in plasma after administration with high or low SRA in primates and humans, applying an extraction procedure validated by TLC. The measured pharmacokinetics of [11C]-flumazenil (T1/2 beta = 45.1 +/- 12.3 min, T1/2 alpha = 1.5 +/- 1.5 min; K = 0.14 +/- 0.14 min-1; Vd area = 44.0 +/- 17.0 l; Clp = 40.0 +/- 8.5 l/h) exhibited a very rapid distribution phase followed by fast elimination, with a large volume of distribution; these results were confirmed by HPLC determinations and agree with previously published data on unlabelled flumazenil. Pharmacokinetics of [11C] Ro 15-3890 acid metabolite show that high drug concentrations in the blood are promptly achieved (kf = 0.13 +/- 0.004 min-1), with a very rapid elimination half-life (T1/2m = 4.47 +/- 1.31 min) comparable to that of [11C]-flumazenil. The percentage metabolization of parent compound to the acid [11C] Ro 15-3890 was constant from the 15th minute and was significantly higher in man compared to the monkey. This percentage was increased by prior eating. The other putative metabolites, i.e. labelled [11C] Ro 15-4965 and unlabelled Ro 15-5528, were never observed at detectable concentrations with TLC and HPLC in rabbit, baboon and human blood samples. This pharmacokinetic study of plasma flumazenil may be useful to implement a dynamic method of CBZR quantification using PET and for analysis of pharmacokinetics in brain tissue.",

The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil had no effect on these behaviors, while the inverse agonist FG 7142 inhibited sexual behavior without affecting motor functions. The GABA antagonist bicuculline was ineffective in all behavioral paradigms, while picrotoxin inhibited all behaviours. Picrotoxin blocked the motor effects of low doses of the benzodiazepines, but not those of higher doses. Neither did this drug block the effects of benzodiazepines on sexual behavior. Bicuculline was unable to block the effects of benzodiazepines on all behaviors. FG 7142, in a low dose, inhibited the effects of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide on ambulatory activity, but not their effects on motor execution or sexual behavior. The effects of the benzodiazepines and picrotoxin on sexual behavior could be a consequence of the motor impairment produced by these drugs, since the doses required to affect these two behaviors were similar. However, the fact that picrotoxin could block the motor deficiencies induced by the benzodiazepines without restoring sexual behavior suggests that these behavioral actions of the drugs can be differentiated. While some evidence was obtained suggesting a role of GABA in the motor effects of benzodiazepines, no evidence could be found for a role of GABA in their effects on sexual behavior.", 
    "28": "Ro 15-4513, a partial benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, counteracts many of the effects of ethanol, however, its effects on ethanol discrimination in operant paradigms remains unclear. The present study examined the effects of Ro 15-4513 on ethanol discrimination by female C57BL/6 mice in a food-reinforced behavior-operant paradigm. Under the time and dosing conditions used in previous reports, Ro 15-4513 did not alter ethanol discrimination whether given prior to or after ethanol exposure. The drug did, however, attenuate ethanol discrimination for brief periods (less than 8 min) when injected after ethanol and at doses and postinjection times which also disrupted responding. The present study confirmed that Ro 15-4513 attenuated ethanol discrimination, but not to the extent as previously reported. The results indicate that postinjection time is a very critical factor in whether Ro 15-4513 attenuates ethanol discrimination.", 
    "29": "A set of 6 molecules, active at the benzodiazepine GABAA site are matched pairwise with one member of the set in turn. Matchings are performed by simulated annealing using null correspondences to reject poorly matched atom positions. Cluster analysis is employed to identify molecular similarities after an optimal molecular superimposition has been discovered. A statistic for the compactness of clustered atom positions is suggested. The introduction of null correspondences causes the clusters of matched atoms to become more compact.", 
    "30": "Adult male and female rats were exposed to either inescapable shock or no treatment. In vitro [3H]Ro 5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) binding (1 nM) to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PRB) in both CNS and peripheral tissues indicated no gender differences in olfactory bulb, heart, lung or adrenal gland but a significant effect was observed in renal tissue. Female rats showed an attenuated stress-induced reduction (23%) in PBR in comparison to males (55%). This difference was shown to be an alteration of Bmax and not kD by Scatchard analysis. These data are the first demonstration of a sexual dimorphism in environmentally-induced alterations in PBR.", 
    "31": "The affinity of buspirone and its main metabolite 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (PmP) for serotonin1 (5-HT1) and benzodiazepine receptors was first evaluated by computerized receptor autoradiography. The results confirmed that buspirone is a selective 5-HT1A ligand, since it inhibited the binding of [3H]5-HT with lower IC50 values (about 100 nM) in regions of the brain of the rat where this receptor subtype is predominant (such as hippocampal areas). Larger IC50 values than 3 microM were found in areas of the brain richer in 5-HT1 receptors, other than the 5-HT1A subtype (e.g. striatum, substantia nigra and the ventricles). The PmP was not selective, inhibiting the binding of [3H]5-HT with similar affinity (about 4-10 microM) in all the regions of the brain examined. Neither buspirone nor PmP, up to 100 microM, were active on benzodiazepine receptors. The autoradiographic technique was therefore used to evaluate the effects of acute (10 mg/kg, p.o., 1 hr before killing) and chronic (10 mg/kg, i.p., twice a day for 21 days, 24 hr washout) treatment with buspirone in male rats. Acute treatment reduced the binding of [3H]5-HT in all the regions of the brain studied, including those with low levels of 5-HT1A receptors, indicating the occupancy of 5-HT1 receptors by either buspirone or its metabolite. The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was decreased (16%) only in the substantia nigra.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "In an attempt to assess the involvement of the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptors (pBDZR) in hepatic encephalopathy (HE), we examined the binding of the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative 3H-PK 11,195 to lymphocyte membranes from a group of patients with liver cirrhosis with or without clinical signs of HE and normal controls. Lymphocyte 3H-PK 11,195 binding is saturable, with high affinity and presents the pharmacological specificity corresponding to pBDZR. A significant 40% decrease in the number of 3H-PK 11,195 binding sites, without a concomitant change in the apparent affinity, is observed in the group with HE as compared to the controls, but not in that with liver diseases without HE. The decrease in binding capacity correlates significantly with the clinical grading of HE, but not with age, sex, aetiology of cirrhosis or presence of surgical shunt. In contrast to the reduction of pBDZR, 3H-N-methylscopolamine binding to lymphocyte muscarinic receptors is not affected in HE. These findings are consistent with a role for pBDZR in HE and may stimulate studies of endogenous modulators and pharmacological agents for these receptors in the disease.", 
    "33": "The effect on interictal electroencephalographic epileptic activity of intravenous flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), a benzodiazepine antagonist and potential antiepileptic drug, was studied in 10 patients. Comparison was made with intravenous diazepam (10 mg) and placebo using a single-blind, single-dose, cross-over design. A dose of 3 mg flumazenil was well tolerated and produced a significantly greater reduction in the number of epileptic transients during the first 40 minutes after injection than did placebo (p less than 0.05). This effect was similar to that of diazepam in magnitude and duration. When flumazenil (3 mg) was administered immediately after intravenous diazepam (10 mg), the reduction in interictal epileptic activity was not significantly different from that produced by diazepam alone. The results suggest that either flumazenil has intrinsic antiepileptic activity and in this respect acts as a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, or that it is antagonising an endogenous proconvulsant ligand in these patients.", 
    "34": "The effects of AT II alone and in combinations with the anticonvulsants diazepam, clonazepam and di-n-propylacetate (depakine) on PTZ-kindling in mice were studied. PTZ-kindling was provoked by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of PTZ (40 mg/kg) every other day in male albino mice until clonic seizures appeared. AT II in doses 0.1 and 1 microgram/mouse intracerebronventricularly (i.c.v.) decreased the intensity of seizures in PTZ-kindled mice. Diazepam (0.25 and 1 mg/kg i.p.), clonazepam (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) and depakine (75 mg/kg) inhibited PTZ-kindled seizures. Combinations of ineffective doses of AT II (0.05 microgram/mouse) and ineffective doses of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) or clonazepam (0.01 mg/kg) or depakine (50 mg/kg) significantly decreased the intensity of seizures in PTZ-kindled mice. The seizure-decreasing effect of diazepam, clonazepam and depakine on PTZ-kindling in mice, which was potentiated by AT II, suggests interactions of AT II receptors with GABA and benzodiazepine receptors or with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex, probably effectuated through alsoteric mechanisms. A more efficient coupling of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex with AT II receptors might also be the reason for the decrease of the intensity of seizures in PTZ-kindled mice.", 
    "35": "The presence of benzodiazepine-like molecules was detected radioimmunologically in the plasma and milk of 12 women and in the plasma of 9 men. All subjects were non-users of benzodiazepines. The concentration of these biological materials expressed as diazepam equivalents per mL amounted to 2.54 +/- 0.74 ng in male plasma; to 2.20 +/- 0.35 ng in female plasma and to 1.91 +/- 0.54 ng in milk. Further investigation of the active compounds in milk permitted the unequivocal identification of diazepam, both free and bound to a presumably protein carrier and, at least, three more benzodiazepine-like molecules. Their origin either from dietary sources or as a result of endogenous biosynthesis is still unclear.", 
    "36": "An increase of proto-oncogene c-fos expression in cerebral cortex of rats treated with subconvulsant doses of the pesticide organochlorine lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) has been detected using Northern blots. Immunohistochemical studies show that Fos protein was already increased in neuronal nuclei 3 h after treatment. The administration of the benzodiazepine diazepam prior to lindane totally blocked the activation of this proto-oncogene expression. Parallel to this increased expression of c-fos an activation of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene and enzyme was also observed. High levels of ODC mRNA and increased enzyme activity in cortex were found in rats following lindane treatment. These changes were attenuated by prior treatment of animals with diazepam. The co-induction of c-fos and ODC suggests a potential link between the ODC/polyamine system and the short-acting proto-oncogenes in stimulus-transcription coupling events.", 
    "37": "The antiulcer activity of BAY P 14551 a thiazolylaminobenzimidazole derivative, was evaluated in different experimental ulcer models and its antiulcer activity was compared to that of different reference drugs. The overall activity of the compound was equal to or more potent than that of reference antiulcer drugs, such as pirenzepine, cimetidine and carbenoxolone, but it was not as potent as rioprostil. The ED50 values (expressed as mumol/kg p.o.) were 68 (confidence limits: 51-91) for indomethacin-induced ulcers, 21 (confidence limits: 13-31) for stress-induced ulcers and 1260 mumol/kg p.o. (confidence limits: 412-3800) for ulcers induced by absolute ethanol. The compound had no activity against cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers and lost its cytoprotective activity in adrenalectomised rats. Since inhibition of gastric acid secretion was seen, if at all, only with the higher doses, the gastro-protective action of BAY P 1455 seemed not to be due to an antisecretory effect, but more likely to a gastroprotective action as hypothesised for prostaglandins.", 
    "38": "The anticonvulsant actions of the adenosine receptor agonists, 1-phenylisopropyladenosine, 2-chloroadenosine and cyclohexyl-adenosine, against DMCM (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate)-induced seizures in mice were studied with an infusion technique. 2-Chloroadenosine and cyclohexyladenosine were active at 1 mg/kg whereas 1-phenyl-isopropyladenosine was active at 0.03 mg/kg given i.p. At 10 mg/kg, 1-phenylisopropyladenosine was only weakly active against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures and not active against bicuculline-induced seizures. The selective effect of 1-phenylisopropyladenosine against DMCM-induced seizures suggests that adenosine receptor agonists may allosterically counteract the negative modulating effect of DMCM on GABA coupling to the chloride channel. This indicates that adenosine receptors may have a physiological function within the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the brain.", 
    "39": "The in vivo central effects of a range of full and partial muscarinic receptor agonists have been investigated on hippocampal theta rhythm and blood pressure. In the isoflurane-anaesthetised rat, pretreated with N-methylscopolamine, i.v. administration of arecoline, oxotremorine, arecaidine propargyl ester, aceclidine and pilocarpine produced dose-dependent increases in the frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm and blood pressure, with an order of potency of arecoline = oxotremorine = arecaidine propargyl ester greater than aceclidine greater than or equal to pilocarpine. To increase theta wave frequency, pilocarpine showed a low maximum response and possessed antagonist activity against arecoline, indicating that pilocarpine was acting as a partial agonist. AF102B failed to alter blood pressure or theta rhythm. Intraventricular injections of scopolamine and the M1 receptor-selective antagonist, pirenzepine, produced dose-dependent antagonism of the enhanced theta wave frequency and hypertensive response produced by arecoline. The differences in antagonist potency for the two responses was less than 6-fold, which indicated that both the increase in hippocampal theta wave activity and increase in blood pressure may have been mediated through muscarinic receptors of the M1 subtype. Further studies using a wider range of antagonists will be required to confirm this conclusion.", 
    "40": "We investigated the effect of selective muscarinic antagonists on atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) release induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of carbachol in the rat. The muscarinic antagonists were given by i.c.v. injection 1 min before carbachol, 1 micrograms/rat. 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), a rather selective M1 and M3 receptor antagonist, was the most potent inhibitor of carbachol-induced ANF release, its ID50 being 0.18 nmol/rat. Pirenzepine, a selective M1 antagonist, also potently inhibited the effect of carbachol, its ID50 being 2.74 nmol/rat. The M3-selective antagonist, p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-diphenidol, was much weaker than pirenzepine, with an ID50 of 57.52 nmol/rat. The selective M2 receptor antagonist, methoctramine, on the other hand, was a very weak inhibitor of carbachol-induced ANF release. The rank order of potency as well as the - log ID50 of the antagonists tested were consistent with their pA2 values for muscarinic M1 receptors, suggesting that this receptor subtype may mediate the central effect of cholinergic mechanisms in the control of ANF release.", 
    "41": "We investigated the involvement of the GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal systems and benzodiazepine (BZP) receptors in ethanol-induced amnesia using a passive avoidance task. Pretraining administration of ethanol impaired the passive avoidance response. The BZP agonist chlordiazepoxide potentiated the amnesia, while the GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin failed to affect it. The acetylcholine esterase inhibitor physostigmine partially attenuated the ethanol-induced amnesia. These results suggest that ethanol-induced amnesia is related to BZP receptors and a dysfunction of the cholinergic neuronal system.", 
    "42": "Primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells are shown to possess a high density (283 +/- 48 fmol/mg of protein) of muscarinic receptor sites, defined using N-[3H]methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS), with a KD of 0.18 +/- 0.01 nM measured after culture in vitro for 7 days. Displacement of specific [3H]NMS binding demonstrated a muscarinic receptor with low affinity for pirenzepine (Ki: 240 nM); further investigation using antagonists, AF-DX 116 and 4-DAMP to discriminate between M2 and M3 receptors respectively, revealed low M2 affinity (Ki: 600 nM) and high M3 affinity (Ki: 2.4 nM), indicative of the M3 receptor subtype. The robust muscarinic receptor stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation, previously observed in these cells, was confirmed. Inhibition of this response followed a similar profile to the binding data, exhibiting weak inhibitory effects for pirenzepine (Ki: 710 nM) and AF-DX 116 (Ki: 5000 nM), but a potent action for 4-DAMP (Ki: 2.4 nM). The opposite profile seen for AF-DX 116 and 4-DAMP is indicative of a M3 receptor subtype expressed on these cells and linked to phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Further studies demonstrated that M3 receptor stimulation caused a rapid, transient increase in the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, suggesting that potential Ca(2+)-homeostatic and neuromodulatory effects may be mediated by this response.", 
    "43": "Post-training i.p. (2.0 or 5.0 mg/kg), i.c.v. (2.5 micrograms/rat), or intra-amygdala (1.6-40 ng/amygdala) administration of Ro 5-4864 causes memory facilitation of step-down inhibitory avoidance in rats. The effect is expressed as an increased latency to step down in a retention test carried out 24 h after training. Ro 5-4864 is a blocker of the Cl(-)-channel associated with GABAA receptors, at a site sensitive to the antagonist, PK11195, and different from that sensitive to picrotoxin. PK11195, given i.c.v. (2.5 micrograms/rat) or into the amygdala (8 ng/amygdala), antagonized the effect of Ro 5-4864. Intra-amygdala picrotoxin administration (80 ng/amygdala) also caused retrograde memory facilitation, but its effect was not antagonized by PK11195. At a higher dose (40 ng/amygdala), PK11195 had an amnestic effect of its own, which suggests that it might be acting against an endogenous ligand of receptor to Ro 5-4864 in the Cl(-)-channel. These findings support the hypothesis that there is a GABAA mechanism in the amygdala normally involved in the modulation of the post-training memory processing of aversive learnings.", 
    "44": "A method was developed to determine the affinities of antimuscarinic drugs at M1 receptors. [3H](+/-)-Telenzepine served as radioligand in crude preparations of calf superior cervical ganglia and showed high affinity for a single receptor population, consisting of M1 receptors (KD = 1.12 nM). Kinetic experiments showed monophasic association (k1 = 0.017 min-1 nM-1) and dissociation (k-1 = 0.017 min-1) kinetics, the half-life of dissociation being 41 min at 37 degrees C. The kinetic KD value amounted to 1.00 nM. M1 affinities for pirenzepine, methoctramine, hexahydro-sila-difenidol and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol determined in competition experiments were similar to those found in functional studies with M1 receptors in rabbit isolated vas deferens. The binding assay was used to determine the affinities of the (R) and (S) enantiomers of tertiary (trihexyphenidyl, hexahydro-difenidol, hexbutinol, p-fluoro-hexbutinol) and quaternary muscarinic antagonists (trihexyphenidyl methiodide, hexbutinol methiodide). Comparison of results obtained with the rabbit vas deferens suggested that the ionic environment may influence the affinities.", 
    "45": "A single bedtime dose of the benzodiazepine hypnotics, flunitrazepam (2 mg), triazolam (0.5 mg) or flurazepam (30 mg), was administered to young, healthy subjects. Abortive first rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) episodes, characterized by a low level of EEG slow-wave activity (spectral power density in the 0.75-4.5 Hz band) without rapid eye movements and/or muscle atonia, were more frequent in the drug night than in the placebo night or in the drug-free night following upon the drug night. The benzodiazepine hypnotics depressed slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep (NREMS) in the drug night and the subsequent drug-free night. However, the typical declining trend of slow-wave activity over the first three NREMS-REMS cycles, and the cyclic ultradian pattern of slow-wave activity were little affected by the hypnotics. The results indicate that benzodiazepine hypnotics depress the generation of slow EEG waves without disrupting the homeostatic and ultradian processes of sleep regulation.", 
    "46": "During the period 1.1.1979-31.12.1988, a total of 2.023 admissions (involving 1.511 patients) occurred on account of deliberate self-poisoning in the Intensive Care Unit of the Anaesthetic Department of Odense Hospital. No significant alterations were observed in the female/male ratio or in the average age, during this period. Duration of hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit showed a decrease. The frequencies of cases of poisoning with barbiturates showed a decrease while poisonings with acetaminophen, alcohol and chemical-technical agents showed increasing frequencies. Poisoning with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, polycyclic antidepressive drugs, dextropropoxyphen or acetylsalicylic acid occurred with unaltered frequency. Treatment consisted mainly of endotracheal intubation, artificial ventilation, circulatory therapy, forced alkaline diuresis, haemodialysis and antibiotic therapy. The frequency of forced alkaline diuresis decreased during the period while circulatory therapy, haemodialysis, antibiotic therapy and treatment with antidotes were employed increasingly frequently. The acute lethality was 1.6%. It is concluded that treatment was mainly symptomatic and concentrated on ensuring respiratory and circulatory functions and that the acute lethality is unchanged and will probably not be lowered further. The \"Scandinavian method\" is thus still the cornerstone in the treatment of poisoning and is responsible for the continued low acute lethality.", 
    "47": "Intracellular recordings were made from neurons of rat lateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and striatum in vitro. Synaptic potentials mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid and by excitatory amino acids were isolated pharmacologically by using receptor antagonists, and their amplitudes were used as a measure of transmitter release. Muscarine and acetylcholine inhibited the release of both gamma-aminobutyric acid and excitatory amino acids, but measurements of the dissociation equilibrium constants for the antagonists pirenzepine, 11-(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one, methoctramine, and hexahydrosiladifenidol indicated clearly that different muscarinic receptors were involved (M1 and probably M3, respectively). The differential localization of distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes on terminals releasing the major inhibitory and excitatory transmitters of the brain could be exploited therapeutically in some movement disorders and Alzheimer disease.", 
    "48": "The imidazodiazepine compound [3H]Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors of the central type, binds with high affinity (order of 10(-8) M) to a single population of benzodiazepine binding sites in the mammalian central nervous system. A quantitative autoradiographic study was carried out to determine the effects of one eye removal on [3H]Ro 15-4513 specific binding to rat brain sections in the superficial gray layer or stratum griseum superficiale (SGS) of the superior colliculus. Retinal afferent degeneration due to right eye removal, performed 3 and 7 days before sacrifice, led to a significant and symmetrical increase in the [3H]Ro 15-4513 specific binding in both right and left SGS by enhancing the binding affinity of the radioligand. This transient phenomenon disappeared when a longer survival period of 45 days was allowed to elapse. Conversely, unilateral lesion of the primary visual areas had no apparent effects on the specific binding of the radioligand. The absence of any loss of binding sites after either type of lesion suggests that the benzodiazepine receptors are probably not situated on the optic nerve axon terminals, nor on the cortical axon terminals originating from primary visual areas. In the SGS, as in other rat brain structures, benzodiazepine receptors of the central type are functionally coupled with GABAA receptors and form 'GABAA receptors/benzodiazepine receptors/chloride channel' complexes. The involvement of the local GABAergic system in the postlesion plasticity of benzodiazepine receptors was studied by testing the effects of exogenously applied GABA on [3H]Ro 15-4513 specific binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The possible involvement of lymphokines in the glial reaction/proliferation that follows brain injury has been investigated by measuring the density of omega 3 (peripheral type benzodiazepine) binding sites associated to glial cells and macrophages after local injection of lymphokines in the rat cerebral cortex and striatum. omega 3 Site densities were measured either by quantitative autoradiography in brain sections or by conventional binding in membrane using [3H]PK 14105 or [3H]PK 11195 as ligands. Intracortical or intrastriatal infusion of interleukin-1 (10 and 20 units) caused a marked increase in the density of omega 3 sites (+83% and +80%, respectively, when compared to saline-infused animals) around the injection site at 7 days postinjection. There was a good spatial correspondence between the autoradiographic distribution of omega 3 sites and the distribution of reactive astrocytes (as assessed by GFAP immunostaining) or acid phosphatase rich cells (phagocytes). Significant increases in omega 3 site densities were also observed in striatal homogenates 1 week after local administration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The maximal increase (+80%) was observed after the administration of 3 units, higher and lower doses resulting in smaller increases. Intrastriatal injection of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin known to stimulate interleukin-1 and TNF-alpha production by microglial cells in culture, also resulted in significant increases in omega 3 site densities in striatal homogenates (maximal increase, +170% 1 week after the injection of 200 ng).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "A case of \"adult respiratory distress syndrome\" after amitriptyline overdosage is reported. Amitriptyline is rapidly absorbed from the intestinal tract and the drug is concentrated in the tissues, particularly the brain, heart and lungs. It is suggested that in large quantities it may inhibit surfactant production and thus cause the clinical picture described. The ventilatory treatments are discussed. It seems that inversed ratio ventilation (IRV) has something to offer, avoiding the use of high oxygen fractions in inspired air and high peak airway pressures. Our patient improved with IRV.", 
    "51": "Triazolam can shift the phase of circadian rhythms in hamsters recorded in constant light or dark. This effect is apparently mediated by physical activity stimulated by the drug. We examined whether triazolam can shift the phase of circadian rhythms in a diurnal primate, the squirrel monkey, that is sedated by triazolam. Single injections of triazolam at 0.15-0.20 mg/kg induced phase advances or delays of monkey activity rhythms recorded in constant light. The phase-response curve is similar to that obtained for hamsters. Behavioral activation is evidently not necessary for a phase-shifting action of triazolam in this primate. A companion study in which triazolam was administered to squirrel monkeys in the dark in a light-dark cycle reentrainment paradigm failed to find evidence for a phase shifting action of triazolam. Shifts induced by triazolam in monkeys recorded in constant light may thus reflect changes in light exposure as a consequence of sedation or altered retinal processing of light.", 
    "52": "Serum concentrations of psychotropic drugs were measured in 363 drivers injured in road accidents and admitted to the emergency department of Angers regional university hospital. The figures obtained were correlated to the presumed responsibility of each driver in the accident. Benzodiazepines and phenobarbitone were found in the serum of 39 drivers, and responsibility was significantly increased in this group. The role played by these medicines in road accidents has often been alluded to in the literature, but the value of these previous studies was limited by the lack of quantitative assays. Measuring serum concentrations has permitted a more accurate analysis of the relationship between responsibility for road accident and consumption of psychotropic drugs, including barbiturates. This has prompted the authors to organize a regional information campaign intended for the general public and doctors and aimed at drawing attention to the higher risk of accident among road users taking these drugs.", 
    "53": "In this study we extended our observations on the role of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in mediating the cholinergic induction of REM sleep. Cats were chronically implanted with sleep recording electrodes and microinjections of Ringer's or muscarinic antagonists followed by the relatively specific M2 muscarinic agonist, cis-methyl-dioxolane (cisdioxo), were made into the medial pontine reticular formation (mPRF). The microinjection of Ringer's followed by cisdioxo significantly increased REM sleep percentage. Atropine, a mixed muscarinic receptor antagonist, administered before cisdioxo blocked the REM sleep increase while pirenzepine, a selective M1 muscarinic antagonist, did not block the cisdioxo-induced increase in REM sleep. Gallamine, a nicotinic and a putative M2 antagonist, tended to inhibit the cisdioxo-induced increase in REM sleep. These results support the hypothesis that the cholinergic stimulation-induced REM sleep in the medial pontine reticular formation is mediated by a non-M1 muscarinic receptor subtype.", 
    "54": "For studies on the excretion of drugs into milk a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was developed to quantitate diazepam and nordazepam in the milk and plasma of humans and rabbits in the presence of their major metabolites, oxazepam and temazepam. Flurazepam was used as an internal standard. The assay involves extractions with diethyl ether and an additional acid clean-up step. Chromatographic separation was achieved by a LiChrospher 60 RP-select B (5 microns) column and KH2PO4- acetonitrile (69:31, v/v) adjusted to pH 2.80 as a mobile phase. The same extraction and chromatographic conditions were suited to both types of samples, milk and plasma. The limits of determination using ultraviolet detection at 241 nm was for diazepam 20 ng/ml and for nordazepam 15 ng/ml. The absolute recoveries of diazepam, nordazepam and flurazepam in human milk were 84, 86 and 92% and in human plasma 97, 89 and 94%, respectively. The within- and between-day accuracy and precision for diazepam and nordazepam in milk and plasma at all concentrations tested (20-1500 ng/ml) were better than 8%. The high fat content which occurs in rabbit milk presented no limitation for the extraction of lipophilic diazepam: the method was successfully used to monitor milk and plasma concentrations of diazepam and nordazepam in lactating New Zealand White rabbits during 26-h infusions of diazepam (1.4 mg/h).", 
    "55": "We have investigated the DNA binding properties of the anthramycin analogues 4, 5, and 6 using fluorescence spectroscopy. A considerable fluorescence enhancement occurs when pyrrolo [1,4] benzodiazepines (P[1,4]Bs) are covalently attached to duplex DNA, which was used to show that neither the presence of RNA, single-stranded DNA, or protein had any effect on the degree of fluorescence enhancement resulting from the incubation of 5 and 6 with DNA. The enhancement was found to be dependent on the presence of the imine functionality in each of the compounds. A wavelength of 320 nm was used to excite the chromophore and its emission wavelength maximum was 420 nm. Additionally, we have discovered that the P[1,4]B ring system exhibits exceptionally favorable fluorescence polarization anisotropy (FPA) decay characteristics. For these more detailed fluorescence measurements, we used the structurally simpler analogue 4,. The time resolved maximum FPA for 4 in glycerol at 25 degrees C is 0.28. This result indicates that the P[1,4]B family of antibiotics could serve as sensitive probes of DNA dynamics in the 0.1 to 35 ns time scale.",

(1989) Science 245, 1389-1392; Malherbe, P., Sigel, E., Baur, R., Perssohn, E., Richards, J. G., and Mohler, H. (1990) J. Neurosci. 10, 2330-2337). However, in brain tissue, only alpha- and beta-subunit proteins have so far been detected. To identify the size and distribution of the gamma 2-subunit protein in brain tissue, polyclonal antibodies were prepared against two synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 1-15 and 336-350 of the cDNA-derived rat gamma 2-subunit sequence. On Western blots, both anti-gamma 2-subunit antisera selectively labeled a 43-kDa protein. gamma 2-Subunit immunoreactivity was detected immunohistochemically in various brain regions, e.g. in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, islands of Calleja, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. Immunoprecipitation with both antisera identified the gamma 2-subunit immunoreactivity in 40 and 50% of the native GABAA receptors purified from bovine and rat brains, respectively. Monoclonal antibody bd24 selectively recognizes the alpha 1-subunit, whereas bd17 recognizes both the beta 2- and beta 3-subunits (Ewert, M., Shivers, B. D., L\u00fcddens, H., Mohler, H., and Seeburg, P. H. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 2043-2048). Since either of these monoclonal antibodies (bd17 and bd24) precipitated approximately 90% of the GABAA receptors, the gamma 2-subunit is frequently associated with the alpha 1-subunit and the beta 2- and/or beta 3-subunit in vivo.", 
    "57": "A case of psychogenic polydipsia is presented. A 40 year old female was brought to the emergency room after a sudden seizure at home. The patient had spontaneous eye opening, was making incomprehensible sounds and had abnormal and agitated flexion of the limbs. Severe cerebral edema was seen on the computed tomogram. The patient was found to have hypotonic polyuria and hyponatremia. Two months previously, the patient had stopped taking bromazepam (a benzodiazepine) and on the advice of a neighbour had taken plenty of water to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The diagnosis and therapy are discussed.", 
    "58": "Midazolam is a widely used drug which has anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, muscle relaxing, anticonvulsant action and strong anterograde amnesic effect. But misuse of large doses were reported. We determined the minimum effective dose of midazolam using nitrous oxide (75%) and pentazocine. Induction of anesthesia needed only 0.03-0.04 mg.kg-1 of midazolam. There were no patients who were awake during operation. Anterograde amnesic effect of midazolam was significantly correlated with age. Older patients should be given midazolam slowly and carefully. Dose of midazolam should be reevaluated for wider application of midazolam.", 
    "59": "Diazepam is known to produce anterograde amnesia in both humans and animals. The present investigation sought to determine if this impairment is a direct result of diazepam's interference with mnemonic processes or a result of deficits in performance or retrieval. Diazepam (3 mg/kg) was administered prior to training in the Morris water maze either before or after the rats had acquired the location of a submerged escape platform. Diazepam was found to impair acquisition but not retrieval of spatial information and this impairment was not due to the sedative, hypothermic or state-dependent learning effects of diazepam. These results replicate previous findings in the Morris water maze and provide new evidence that this deficit is primarily mnemonic in nature.", 
    "60": "The effects of acute and chronic administration of buspirone and midazolam were examined in White Carneau pigeons (N = 5) responding under a fixed-ratio 30 (FR 30) schedule of food presentation. Each drug was studied in all pigeons. For three pigeons, buspirone was studied before midazolam, while the order was reversed for the other two subjects. For each drug, a dose-response curve was determined before (prechronic) and two weeks after (postchronic) discontinuation of chronic administration. Prior to chronic drug administration, buspirone (0.3-5.6 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) decreased response rates in all subjects, in a dose-dependent manner. Midazolam was more potent than buspirone; midazolam's ED50 (95% C.I.) was 0.53 (0.41-0.69) mg/kg compared to 2.55 (1.48-4.41) mg/kg for buspirone. For each subject, the lowest dose that decreased responding by at least 50% was administered daily, immediately before the session, for up to 6 weeks. At the lowest daily dose of buspirone, complete recovery of baseline rates was observed in 3 pigeons. However, when the buspirone dose was increased, responding remained below control rates in all but one pigeon. During chronic midazolam administration, tolerance developed to the rate-decreasing effects of midazolam in 4 subjects. When saline was substituted for buspirone or midazolam, suppressed responding returned to predrug rates in all subjects. When the dose-response curves were redetermined, the postchronic ED50 for buspirone was 3.79 (2.10-6.82) mg/kg, which was not significantly different from the prechronic ED50, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to buspirone's rate-decreasing effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Most criteria for establishing GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nucleus of inferior colliculus (ICc) have been satisfied, but the role of GABA in acoustic coding in ICc is not established. The present study examined this issue by evaluating the effects of iontophoretic application of agents that alter activity at GABA receptors on potential forms of acoustically-evoked inhibition in ICc neurons. Application of the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, selectively blocked the firing reduction at high intensities observed during non-monotonic rate-intensity functions in ICc neurons. Binaural inhibition was selectively blocked by bicuculline and increased by nipecotic acid. Application of GABA, nipecotic acid (GABA uptake inhibitor) and a benzodiazepine (flurazepam), which enhances the action of GABA, increased the duration and intensity of ipsilateral inhibition and response pause, while bicuculline blocked these acoustically-evoked inhibitory events. Offset inhibition was increased by nipecotic acid application and reduced by bicuculline with the appearance of an offset peak. The present data support an important role for GABA as a neurotransmitter, mediating, in part, non-monotonicity, binaural inhibition, response pause and offset inhibition in ICc neurons. Alterations of these GABA-mediated inhibitory phenomena may occur in auditory dysfunctions observed with aging and audiogenic seizures.", 
    "62": "The effects of enoxacin, a new quinolone antibacterial agent, and its combination with 4-biphenylacetate (BPA), an active metabolite of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent fenbufen, were examined on population spikes induced by electrical stimulation of the stratum radiatum in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer in rat hippocampal slices. Enoxacin (10(-4) M) and bicuculline (10(-6) M) increased the amplitude of the population spikes and anew elicited the second spikes (latency: 10 msec.), while BPA (10(-5) M) decreased the amplitude of the population spikes. However, the combination of enoxacin (10(-6), 10(-5) M) with BPA (10(-5) M) elicited the second spikes or epileptiform bursts with an increase of the population spike amplitude. The dose-response relationships showed that the effect of enoxacin was 100 times potentiated in the presence of BPA (10(-5) M). The second spikes induced by enoxacin (10(-4) M) were suppressed by muscimol (10(-6) M) and baclofen (10(-6) M), but not by clorazepate (5 x 10(-5) M) and pentobarbital (5 x 10(-5) M). The second spikes induced by bicuculline (10(-6) M) were suppressed by these four drugs. The second spikes by the combination of enoxacin (10(-6) M) with BPA (10(-5) M) were suppressed by muscimol (5 x 10(-6) M), but not by clorazepate (5 x 10(-5) M). These results suggest that the combination of enoxacin with BPA exerts a drug interaction to elicit the second spikes or epileptiform bursts with its mode of action different from that of bicuculline.", 
    "63": "Within the framework of a coordinated collaborative study for evaluating assays for aneuploidy, nine known or suspected spindle poisons were tested in mitotic segregation assays with Aspergillus nidulans. Experiments with A. nidulans diploid strain P1 revealed a statistically significant increase of whole chromosome segregants (non-disjunctional diploids and haploids) after treatments with chloral hydrate (CH), thiabendazole (TB), thimerosal (TM) econazole (EZ) and hydroquinone (HQ). The latter two chemicals also increased the frequency of mitotic cross-overs. Colchicine (COL), diazepam (DZ), cadmium chloride (CD) and pyrimethamine (PY) were ineffective. Further experiments with CH, TB, TM and EZ in the haploid strain 35 demonstrated that CH, TB and TM induced hyperploid types, thus indicating a primary effect on chromosome segregation in A. nidulans. However, since EZ did not induce putative hyperploids in strain 35 and trisomics in diploid 31, it is suggested that EZ affects chromosome segregation by an indirect mechanism, possibly related to induced structural chromosome damage, as previously shown for HQ.", 
    "64": "To evaluate the psychopharmacological effects and potential abuse liability of the novel analgesic flupirtine maleate the subjective and behavioral effects of orally administered flupirtine, lorazepam and placebo were studied in polydrug abusers. Effects were measured before and for 6 h after drug administration under double-blind conditions. At therapeutic doses flupirtine was not differentiated from placebo. Lorazepam and higher doses of flupirtine produced increases in subject-rated liking, ARCI MBG scale scores, and sedative-like effects including impaired psychomotor performance. Flupirtine, but not lorazepam, increased ratings on measures indicating dysphoric effects. The results indicate that flupirtine has some sedative-like effects but that its abuse potential is probably modest.",

The method involves a 3-step solvent extraction, clean-up on a silica gel column and gas chromatography using a nitrogen phosphorus detector and a capillary column. Estazolam was used as an internal standard. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 1 ng/g-1 microgram/g and the lower limit of detection was 0.5 ng/g. A forensic study was performed on the toxicological effects of triazolam using putrefied tissues.", 
    "66": "An innovative diazepam injectable emulsion, recently characterized, was submitted to short- and long-term stability studies. The initial pH of the diazepam emulsion decreased progressively with time. However, this pH decrease can be controlled by adjusting the initial pH of the emulsion. At initial adjusted pH of 7.4 or 8.0, the pH decrease of the emulsions was markedly diminished as confirmed by pH follow-up over 10 months storage. All the emulsions prepared using less than 25% oily phase remained stable at the various storage temperatures over a 10 month period. However, emulsion stability was highly dependent on the non-ionic emulsifier concentration, while both low and high phospholipid concentrations reduced emulsion stability. Furthermore, the diazepam remained intact in the emulsion, as confirmed by HPLC when stored at 4 degrees and 25 degrees C over a 16-month storage period. The optimal emulsion formulation was stable to conventional steam sterilization cycles. Exposure of the emulsion to mechanical stress conditions did not affect the integrity of the emulsion, indicating that the dosage form developed remained practically stable.", 
    "67": "Thirty years ago chlordiazepoxide was used in psychiatry for the first time. Benzodiazepines, a therapeutic class with a large spectrum of activities, are now used regularly by 5 to 15% of adults. In France 15% of prescriptions include at least 1 benzodiazepine and 5 compounds of this class appear among the 30 most frequently prescribed of state reimbursed medications. In a developing country like Tunisia sales of psychotropic drugs increased by 84% between 1984 and 1987, benzodiazepines representing half of the prescriptions. Criticisms were voiced as early as in the years 1970. Ralph Nader himself led a campaign against those drugs used in suicidal attempts, provoking car accidents and industrial injuries, memory deficits and dependence. Later, several side effects were pin-pointed: amnesia, which has been used with criminal intent in a few dramatic cases; in fact it should be differentiated from the cognitive troubles resulting from anxiety itself; tolerance: for instance in drug addicts using high doses; it concerns only some effects of the drug; dependence: which remains rare when contrasted with the large consumption of benzodiazepines; withdrawal reaction should be differentiated from teh relapse of anxiety once the drug has been discontinued. In the public opinion one is supposed to bear any pain--and never complain--when it is psychic and not somatic. Benzodiazepines that alleviate psychic pain were considered with spite and then grudge, to use the terminology of erotomania. Actually, benzodiazepine treatment should be a part of a larger therapeutic program taking into account the characteristics of each individual patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "It has been suggested that anxiety and depression are correlated dimensions of behaviour. Consequently, this study investigated the behaviour of the Flinders Sensitive Line, an animal model of depression with cholinergic supersensitivity, in the elevated (+)-maze test of anxiety. The results indicate that anxiety responses (% open/total arm entries) do not differ between the Flinders Sensitive and Flinders Resistant (control) lines of rat (FSL vs. FRL, respectively). Treatment with 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam significantly increased % open/total scores to a similar degree in both lines, further suggesting that the lines do not differ in anxiety. It is concluded that the FSL rat is an animal model of depression without evidence for inherent alteration in anxiety-related behaviour.", 
    "69": "Chronic treatment with alprazolam reversed the effect of acute stress on the concentration of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (IR-BE) in the anterior pituitary (AP) and increased the amount of beta-endorphin (BE) relative to beta-lipotropin (B-LPH). In chronically stressed animals, administration of alprazolam did not alter the effect of a single stressful episode on the concentration of IR-BE in the AP, the NIL or the plasma, however, the amount of BE relative to B-LPH was increased in the AP and the plasma. Administration of alprazolam resulted in a significant decrease in the perception of pain. A low dose of alprazolam produced the most consistent decrease in nociception over time. The present findings suggest that alprazolam may modify the effects of acute and chronic stress on BE release from the pituitary. Moreover, alprazolam appears to have an antinociceptive effect in addition to its affect as an anxiolytic.", 
    "70": "We examined the effect of prenatal stress exposure on sensitivity to diazepam. The stress exposure consisted of handling pregnant rats 5 minutes daily from the 14th to 21st day of gestation. Male offspring were tested at 60 days of age in a modified open-field apparatus 30 minutes after injection with diazepam (0, 1, 5 mg/kg). The 5 mg/kg dose of diazepam depressed the frequency and duration of crossover, rearing, headpoke and corner activities. Rearing was not affected by the 1 mg/kg dose of diazepam. Defecation was increased by the 1 mg/kg dose, but was decreased by 5 mg/kg of diazepam. Prenatal stress exposure altered responsiveness to diazepam on only crossover activity and on defecation. Prenatally stressed animals exhibited an increase in crossover at the low dose of diazepam, while control offspring were insensitive to this dose level. Also, there were more boli in prenatally stressed rats treated with 1 mg/kg diazepam, while the 5 mg/kg dose of the drug decreased the number of boli. The other measures showed a trend in the same direction but the differences were not statistically significant. Thus our results indicate that prenatal stress has very specific effects on the sensitivity of adult offspring to diazepam.",

The pharmacotherapy is presented according to different clinical phases of the alcoholic process. The acute intoxicated patient receives supportive treatment, to be clinically observed to prevent severe respiratory depression, aspiration of vomitus, and severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepine therapy is the mainstay in treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Disulfiram is the only chemical used in the United States to deter the alcoholic patient from further alcohol drinking. Although there is not a specific agent for alcoholism per se during the sobriety state, the alcoholic patients' concurrent underlying psychiatric conditions (such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression) should be treated properly and adequately.",

    "73": "This paper critically examines the pharmacological provocation and treatment of panic disorder. An analysis of research findings on how panic attacks are induced indicates that there are psychological and non specific factors that may mediate biochemical etiological models, and these individual differences need to be investigated further. This has important implications for the psychopharmacological management of panic. A review of studies on treating panic disorder with imipramine and alprazolam emphasizes the importance of several non specific factors that include the role of self-directed in vivo exposure and changes in dysphoria and self-efficacy (subjective beliefs regarding personal competency) in predicting outcome. It is recommended that any treatment of panic-related disorders include self-directed, in vivo exposure.", 
    "74": "In a randomized double-blind, cross-over trial of 34 patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy (20-100 mg/m2), the antiemetic effect of high-dose metoclopramide (HDM) (10 mg/kg iv. loading dose + 7 hours continuous infusion) + lorazepam (L) (2.5 mg x 4 po) was compared with low-dose metoclopramide (LDM) (70 mg) + L (2.5 mg x 2 po) + dehydrobenzperidol (5 mg x 2 im). Among the 29 patients who completed the cross-over, HDM significantly reduced the number of vomiting episodes (p = 0.002) and the degree of nausea (p = 0.004). Seventeen patients preferred the HDM and 4 the LDM regimen (p = 0.01). Sedation was seen in all but 1 patient, and was graded as severe in 6 patients receiving the HDM and in 2 patients receiving the LDM regimen. No extrapyramidal adverse reactions were seen. We conclude that high-dose metoclopramide + lorazepam is a safe antiemetic regimen and significantly superior to low-dose metoclopramide + lorazepam + dehydrobenzperidol. Owing to the severe sedation which occurs in some patients, the dose of lorazepam should be individually adjusted.", 
    "75": "Cholinergic replacement therapies have yielded little or no clinical improvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the number of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors remains unchanged in the cerebral cortex, the involvement of other neurotransmitter systems may account for this limited efficacy. Alternatively, there may be a defective coupling of the muscarinic receptor with its nucleotide-binding protein in AD, which would severely limit the ability of cholinergic agonists to activate intracortical second messengers. To address this possibility, we assessed the ability of the putative M1 muscarinic receptor to form high-affinity agonist-receptor complexes with guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins in postmortem frontal cortex. Agonist affinity states of the M1 muscarinic receptor were measured by carbachol/[3H]-pirenzepine competition. M1 muscarinic receptors exhibited both high (KH) and low (KL) affinities for the agonist carbachol. High-affinity agonist binding to M1 receptors in postmortem frontal cortex samples from subjects with AD was reduced, demonstrated by an increase in the KH value. Low-affinity agonist binding (KL value) was unchanged in AD and was not significantly different from the KL value for the uncoupled receptor determined in the presence of guanine nucleotides. The increase in the KH value resulted in a 70% decrease in the average KL/KH ratio for AD as compared to control samples. Choline acetyltransferase activities correlated significantly with the KL/KH ratios (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that the KL/KH ratio for muscarinic agonists may serve as a neurochemical marker of disease severity. The reduced ability of the M1 receptor subtype to form a high-affinity agonist state in AD may account for the failure of cholinergic replacement therapies to improve specific features of memory and cognition.", 
    "76": "The thiamylal- and halothane-sparing effect of diazepam was studied in two experiments using 32 conditioned dogs. Twenty-four dogs received 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 ml/kg diazepam or 0.9% saline (placebo) prior to the administration of thiamylal sodium i.v. Eight dogs received 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg diazepam i.v. or placebo prior to or during halothane anesthesia. All three doses of diazepam significantly decreased the amount of thiamylal required to allow orotracheal intubation. The 0.2 mg/kg i.v. dose of diazepam produced the most significant effects. Premedication of dogs with diazepam did not reduce the concentration of halothane required to maintain anesthesia. The administration of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg diazepam i.v. during halothane anesthesia decreased the concentration of halothane required to maintain anesthesia. These studies demonstrate that diazepam reduces the amount of thiamylal required for orotracheal intubation, and when given intra-operatively reduces the concentration of halothane required to maintain anesthesia.", 
    "77": "'Prescription-event monitoring' (PEM) is one of two national systems of post-marketing surveillance in operation in Britain. It identified 22,065 patients who had received NHS prescriptions for alprazolam, and data available on 10,895 of these were analysed. The main reasons for treatment with alprazolam were anxiety and depression. The patients provided 3360 patient-years of treatment and 7540 patient-years of follow-up. No serious events clearly associated with treatment were recorded. The main events reported during treatment, albeit infrequently, were drowsiness and depression, although depression is more likely to be due to the disorder being treated than to the drug. Some of the other alleged unwanted effects of alprazolam in published reports were not encountered. Since PEM is unable to determine the dependence potential of alprazolam, further evaluation of this problem is called for.", 
    "78": "Numerous reports have concluded that propofol is suitable for maintenance of anesthesia by continuous infusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of propofol and fentanyl for coronary bypass surgery in patients with good left ventricular function. The effects of this anesthetic combination on quality of anesthesia, hemodynamic status, and endocrine and metabolic responses were assessed. Postoperative recovery and side effects were also noted. The effects were compared with those of a standard method using etomidate, midazolam, and fentanyl. METHODS. Twenty patients who presented for aortocoronary bypass surgery (NYHA class II-III) were randomly allocated to one of two groups: propofol-fentanyl (group A) or etomidate-midazolam-fentanyl (group B). In each patient the dosage of the drugs was adjusted to obtain the optimum responses during induction and maintenance. RESULTS. Propofol in combination with fentanyl diminished mean arterial pressure (-28.7%) and heart rate (-17.3%) when used for induction in patients with ischemic heart disease, even in low doses and with slow administration. In 5 of the 10 patients it was impossible to prevent a critical fall in coronary perfusion without active intervention. However, during maintenance anesthesia, stable circulatory parameters were obtained with both drug regimens. Clinical signs thought to reflect myocardial ischemia were not observed. In both groups reductions in basal and stimulated catecholamine secretion were demonstrated. Similarly, perioperative cortisol secretion was reduced with both techniques. Despite all the complicated metabolic inhibitory effects seen, preoperative hormonal levels were restored within 1 h of the end of anesthesia. The magnitude and duration of the metabolic changes were found to be related to the duration of surgery. There was no evidence of non-homogeneous tissue perfusion as assessed by increases in lactate concentration, cardiac ischemia, or liver dysfunction in any of the patients. There were no postoperative complications in either group, but the return of consciousness, adequate spontaneous ventilation, and psychomotor activity was more rapid in the propofol patients. CONCLUSION. In summary, it can be concluded that a propofol infusion technique positively enhances the recovery period after cardiac surgery and provides good control during anesthesia. However, the use of propofolfentanyl for induction of anesthesia in patients with limited coronary perfusion is not recommended because of its hypotensive effect.", 
    "79": "To study the prevalence of problem drinking among patients undergoing methadone treatment programmes, 170 patients were assessed using the self-administered alcohol screening test (mSAAST). Fifty-three (31.9%) patients scored 7 or more on the mSAAST, indicating actual or potential drinking problems. There was a slight tendency for these to be male. Patients who abused alcohol also tended to use benzodiazepines irrespective of sex. The results of the study seem to indicate that the prevalence of dual alcohol and opiate use is high amongst patients attending drug dependency units. Furthermore comprehensive research is required in order to plan effective treatment for these dual addicted patients.", 
    "80": "Alcohol and drug dependence among the elderly is common and yet frequently underdiagnosed. The practice of self-administration of prescribed medications, particularly sedative/hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medications is prevalent, with untoward consequences in the geriatric population. Dementia, depression, and anxiety syndromes are some of the consequences of alcohol and drug dependence, and may mimic other causes of these disorders. The clinician's index of suspicion must be high enough to make the proper diagnosis of these alcohol- and drug-induced syndromes. Unnecessary evaluations, improper diagnosis, and ineffective and costly treatments may be avoided if alcohol and drug dependence is identified and treated. Effective treatment for alcohol and drug dependence does exist for the elderly and may be instituted in a cost-effective manner.", 
    "81": "Patients who meet DSM-III-R criteria for a diagnosis of panic disorder often show a complex mixture of psychopathological symptoms, including panic attacks (spontaneous and situational), anxiety (anticipatory and generalized), phobias (fear and avoidance), depression/dysphoria, and social and occupational disability. Various theories about the pathogenesis of these symptoms have been advanced that focus on a given symptom (e.g., panic, phobia) being primary in these disorders, with concurrent symptoms seen as epiphenomena or as secondary and reactive to a core symptom. This study, conducted on a large sample of panic disorder patients (N = 1,168), examines the temporal sequential pattern of symptom improvement in these patients, and explores how these relationships relate to various pathogenic theories. Our multiple analyses, when considered together, tend not to support any pathogenic theory that views a given symptom as being central to the overall disorder; our findings have obvious implications for theoreticians and clinicians interested in the study and treatment of panic and anxiety disorders.", 
    "82": "The effectiveness of midazolam and a mixture of morphine-perphenazine premedication to produce sedation and their effects on preoperative oxygen saturation (SaO2) were examined. Eighty-five patients whose SaO2 measured with a pulse oximeter was greater than 90% and who were not receiving narcotic sedatives or oxygen were randomized to three groups. Each patient had his SaO2 recorded before premedication with placebo (saline), midazolam 0.08 mg.kg-1 or morphine 0.15 mg.kg-1 with perphenazine 2.5-5.0 mg im. From 30-90 min later, prior to anaesthesia SaO2 was repeated, and a sedation score was obtained by a blinded observer using a seven point scale. Median sedation scores were greater for midazolam (4) than for morphine-perphenazine (2) and placebo (1) (P less than 0.0001). As well, there was a decrease in the SaO2 in the morphine-perphenazine group (1.7 +/- 2.7%, P less than 0.001) but not in the midazolam and placebo groups (0.1 +/- 2.3%, -0.8 +/- 2.1%). In conclusion midazolam produced greater sedation than morphine-perphenazine and placebo without effect on SaO2 whereas morphine-perphenazine showed a decrease in SaO2 preoperatively.", 
    "83": "The reactions to oral ethanol (0.75 ml/kg), IV low-dose diazepam (0.12 mg/kg) and IV high-dose diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) were evaluated over four test sessions in the same 48 healthy young men. The data demonstrated similar subjective feelings after the low-dose diazepam and ethanol, but significantly greater effect after high-dose diazepam. Despite the similarities on subjective feelings, the low-dose diazepam challenge resulted in significantly more impairment than did ethanol on measures of memory, body sway and the evaluation of the passage of time. The similarities in subjective aspects of intoxication for ethanol and low-dose diazepam have potential implications for increasing our understanding of possible enhanced vulnerabilities for abuse of benzodiazepines among alcohol-abusing patients. The trend for similarities in subjective intoxication but greater impairment in motor and cognitive performance after low-dose diazepam compared to ethanol might indicate that subjects might be less aware of their actual levels of performance difficulties after the benzodiazepine. It is hoped that these data will help clinicians understand more about the quality of intoxication with benzodiazepines and the types of impairments likely to be observed.", 
    "84": "Clonidine is known to reduce anaesthetic requirements and improve haemodynamic stability when given as premedication. This study, of 46 ASA I-II patients undergoing thyroid surgery, was designed to assess if clonidine interferes with recovery from anaesthesia. Patients were allocated randomly to three groups to receive, 2 h before surgery, flunitrazepam 1 mg, clonidine 150 micrograms, or both drugs. Anaesthesia comprised thiopentone, alfentanil, isoflurane and 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Recovery from anaesthesia was assessed using a clinical score, electro-oculographic measurements and reaction times to auditory stimuli. Psychomotor tests were performed the day before surgery and 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after arrival of the patient in the recovery room. Psychomotor performance was decreased significantly after operation in the three groups (P less than 0.05) and returned to baseline at 240 min. There was no significant difference between the three groups. This study indicates that clonidine 150 micrograms orally before surgery does not delay recovery from anaesthesia.", 
    "85": "A prospective study of routine premedication management was carried out at a large teaching hospital. Many patients received their premedication at times inappropriate for it to be effective. Several patients receiving regular medication had this suddenly stopped pre-operatively. Prolonged fasting occurred in both elective and emergency groups of patients. Benzodiazepines and opioids were prescribed most frequently and drying agents were used widely. Antacids, H2-blockers and agents to promote gastric emptying were used very little despite the potential of aspiration in many groups of patients. This audit of activity has revealed several areas of practice that can either be improved immediately or warrant detailed investigation."
