    "1": "A blood sample was obtained from patients who had been taken to The Alfred Emergency & Trauma Centre (Prahran, Vic., Australia) following a motor vehicle collision. This was performed at the same time and under the same law as compulsory blood screening in Victoria (Section 56 of the Road Safety Act). Four hundred and thirty-six specimens were analysed. Blood stored in vacutainer tubes containing preservative were screened for drugs using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gas chromatography-mass spectometry analysis. Medically administered drugs were excluded from the results.", 
    "2": "Four hundred and thirty-six specimens were analysed. Metabolites of cannabis were the most commonly found drug (46.7%), the active form of cannabis (Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol) was found in 33 specimens (7.6%). The next most prevalent drugs were benzodiazepines (15.6%), opiates (11%), amphetamines (4.1%) and methadone (3%). Cocaine was detected in 1.4% of cases. Of the motor vehicle collisions 66% involved males and females of 15-44 years old and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol was almost exclusively found in this age group. In motor vehicle collisions involving older drivers there was an increasing use of benzodiazepines. In women >65 years old 30% were positive for benzodiazepines.", 
    "3": "Drug usage found in this group of injured drivers was disturbingly high. The introduction of further initiatives to decrease the prevalence of drug use in motor vehicle drivers is required.",

    "8": "Blood samples for determination of alprazolam pharmacokinetics were collected by venipuncture up to 72 hours after dosing. A validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection method was used to quantify the alprazolam plasma concentration. The overall extent of alprazolam absorption from the ODT formulation, as measured by area under the concentration-time curve, was unaffected during fed conditions. However, the rate of alprazolam absorption was slower after administration during fed relative to fasted conditions. The mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) decreased approximately 25%, and time to Cmax (Tmax) was delayed approximately 1.5 hours when food was administered before dosing.", 
    "9": "Coadministration of food was shown to have no effect on extent of absorption of immediate-release alprazolam ODT 1.0 mg when compared with drug administration in the fasted condition; however, the rate of drug absorption was decreased. The clinical significance of the difference in rate of alprazolam absorption is unknown but thought to be minimal.",

    "11": "Sports and military environments have many common features - intense physical activity, rigorous physical environment (heat, cold, high or low pressure, hypoxia, acceleration...), specific psychosocial atmosphere, team spirit. If combined with jet lag syndrome, these specific conditions can favor altered physical and mental performance. There is always the temptation to use drugs as a simple way to reduce the penalizing effects. The available compounds known to affect sleep and wakefulness include hypnotics, benzodiazepines and non benzodiazepines such as temazepam, zolopidem, and zopiclone, stimulants such as amphetamine and amphetamine-like agents, adrafinil, modafinil, caffeine and chronobiotics substances such as melatonin and, more recently, slow release caffeine. In the sports area, all of these substances except caffeine are on the list of forbidden products, although special authorizations linked to known disease conditions are allowed. In the military setting, the environment may be similar, but the context of use is very different. In the context of a rescue mission, the current practice in the French military organization is to place modafinil pills in the ejection seat of fight planes and in rescue boats. A second context is the use of anti-sleep agents under orders; the debate continues on this and the appropriate recommendations in this context. Self-medication is a third condition, in which case no rules have been defined.", 
    "12": "This paper is a review of the use of drugs in sleep and wakefulness disorders. Insomnia is more often a symptom than an autonomic disorder. Good knowledge of the clinical facts is required before prescribing hypnotics. Sedative drugs are potentially hypnotics; yet, melatonin is not sedative and may be considered to resynchronise of sleep phases. Stimulant drugs are prescribed in attention disorders; methylphenidate is the more frequently used. Narcolepsy, which is characterized by daytime sleepiness and irresistible episodes of sleep, is treated by an alpha1 noradrenergic stimulant modafinil which has no amphetaminic properties.", 
    "13": "Insomnia is a subjective complaint relating to approximately 30% of the adult population in France, described by the patient as a difficulty of initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Its prevalence increases with age and sex: women are more affected than men (24% vs 14%). Insomnia is either occasional (20%), or chronic (10%). Chronic insomnia has an important impact on patients' everyday life e.g. fatigue, perturbed diurnal waking state, impaired quality-of-life... which results in lower work productivity and drowsiness as well as relational difficulties, absenteeism. About 80% of patients consult their general practitioner first. The aim of a hypnotic agent is to obtain sleep as physiological as possible. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines-like agents (zopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon) are the most widely used hypnotics. However, their indications must be limited to occasional insomnia with a limited duration: less than four weeks. There is no advantage with using a combination of hypnotic agents, a practice which should be prohibited. Adverse effects can be serious, e.g. diurnal somnolence associated with risks of road accidents and, in the elderly, the risk of falls. After chronic use, hypnotics can be addictive, as their effects wear off in three to four weeks. After withdrawal, insomnia rebound is frequent. Use of hypnotics in association with alcohol is a well-known drug-addiction behavior. According to the French health insurance fund, 9% of the general population use hypnotics and about half of them regularly. Insurance refunds for hypnotics and sedatives reach more than 110 million euros annually. The efficiency of hypnotics wears off, quickly for benzodiazepines (three - four weeks), or less quickly for zopiclone and zolpidem (a few months). Insomnia is a major public health issue, each year 10% of the incident cases of insomnia treated by hypnotics joint the group of subjects with chronic insomnia. This failure to treat insomnia properly can be explained, at least in part, by several insufficiencies: physicians and pharmacists training, medical profession awareness, research, public information on the rules of good sleep (public health campaigns, booklets, role of physicians and the pharmacists).",

In contrast, TSPO expression was not different in intermediate versus high-grade tumors or in lymph node-positive versus -negative patients.", 
    "17": "The differences in TSPO expression between colon and rectum carcinoma may imply that these tumors are of different biological behavior.", 
    "18": "Stress can be viewed as a cause of adverse circumstance that induces a wide range of biochemical and behavioral changes. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to the genesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric problems. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of alprazolam in acute immobilization-induced various behavioral and biochemical alteration in mice. Mice were immobilized for a period of 6 h. Alprazolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 min before subjecting the animals to acute stress and several behavioral (mirror chamber, actophotometer, tail flick test) and biochemical tests (malondialdehyde level, glutathione, catalase, nitrite and protein) were performed. Acute immobilization stress for a period of 6 h caused severe anxiety, analgesia and decreased locomotor activity in mice. Biochemical analyses revealed an increase in malondialdehyde, nitrite level and depleted glutathione and catalase activity in stressed brain. Pretreatment with alprazolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reversed immobilization stress-induced anxiety, analgesia and impaired locomotor activity. Biochemically, alprazolam pretreatment decreased malondialdehyde, nitrite activity and restored reduced glutathione level and catalase activity. These results suggest that alprazolam has a neuroprotective effect and can be used in the treatment and management of stress and related disorders.",

A total of 203 papers were found using the reported searches, of which four presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are summarised in table 1.

    "20": "Olanzapine is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic drug (AAPD). Major side effects of olanzapine are weight gain and development of diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. The possible causes of metabolic adverse effects are known as poor satiety and increased food intake due to blockade of receptors such as 5-HT(2C) in CNS. In this study, we examine the effect of olanzapine on peripheral adipogenesis using cultured 3T3-L1 cell model. Olanzapine increased triacylglyceride (TG) accumulation during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation to mature adipocyte phenotype. TG accumulation was accompanied by overexpression of fatty acid synthase and adiponectin that are the downstream genes of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), one of the key transcription factors in lipid homeostasis. We further consisted that mostly SREBP-1 and at a lesser extent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), but not CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-alpha), were overexpressed and activated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to olanzapine. Furthermore, we showed that olanzapine enhanced the activity of SRE-1-containing LDLR promoter in transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes and HepG2 cells. Taken together, olanzapine may cause body weight gain not only through influencing CNS receptors, but also affecting the peripheral adipogenesis regulated by SREBP-1.",

The primary efficacy measure was response (improvement), defined as a decrease of 30% or more in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score from baseline and a Clinical Global Impression Scale improvement rating of \"1\" (very much improved) or \"2\" (much improved).", 
    "23": "Significantly more clozapine-treated adolescents met response criteria (66%) compared with olanzapine-treated subjects (33%). Clozapine was superior to olanzapine in terms of reduction of the psychosis cluster scores and negative symptoms from baseline to end point. However, both treatments were associated with significant weight-gain and related metabolic abnormalities.", 
    "24": "This double-blind randomized comparison of two second-generation antipsychotic drugs for treatment-refractory adolescents with schizophrenia supports clozapine as the agent of choice.

    "25": "The cloning of abiotic stress-inducible genes from the moss Physcomitrella patens led to the identification of the gene PpTSPO1, encoding a protein homologous to the mammalian mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and the bacterial tryptophane-rich sensory protein. This class of proteins is involved in the transport of intermediates of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Like the mammalian homologue, the PpTSPO1 protein is localized to mitochondria. The generation of PpTSPO1-targeted moss knock-out lines revealed an essential function of the gene in abiotic stress adaptation. Under stress conditions, the PpTSPO1 null mutants show elevated H(2)O(2) levels, enhanced lipid peroxidation and cell death, indicating an important role of PpTSPO1 in redox homeostasis. We hypothesize that PpTSPO1 acts to direct porphyrin precursors to the mitochondria for heme formation, and is involved in the removal of photoreactive tetrapyrrole intermediates.", 
    "26": "The beta amyloid (Abeta) cascade has been at the forefront of the hypothesis used to describe the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is generally accepted that drugs that can regulate the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway may have a therapeutic potential. Previous studies have shown that protein kinase C (PKC) hypofunction has an important role in AD pathophysiology. Therefore, the effects of a new PKC activator, alpha-APP modulator [(2S,5S)-(E,E)-8-(5-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,4-pentadienoylamino)benzolactam (TPPB)], on APP processing were investigated. Using PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y(APP695) cells, it was found that TPPB promoted the secretion of sAPPalpha without affecting full-length expression of APP. The increase in sAPPalpha by TPPB was blocked by inhibitors of PKC, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and tyrosine kinase, suggesting the involvement of these signal transduction pathways. TPPB increased alpha-secretase activity [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)10 and 17], as shown by direct fluorescence activity detection and Western blot analysis. TPPB-induced sAPPalpha release was blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-2, furin inhibitor CMK and by the protein-trafficking inhibitor brefeldin. The results also showed that TPPB decreased beta-secretase activity, Abeta40 release and beta site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression, but did not significantly affect neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression. Our data indicate that TPPB could direct APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway by increasing alpha-secretase activity, and suggest its therapeutic potential in AD.", 
    "27": "In vitro studies were conducted to elucidate the metabolic profiles of and the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of (R)- and (S)-tofisopam (1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-ethyl-7,8-dimethoxy-4-methyl-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine). Large differences were observed between the two enantiomers. The major metabolite in incubations of 500 ng/ml (approximately 1.3 microM) (R)-tofisopam in human liver microsomes corresponded to demethylation of the methoxy group at the 4-position of the phenyl ring (M3). Incubating (R)-tofisopam with recombinant cytochrome P450 (P450) or with human liver microsomes and isoform-selective P450 chemical inhibitors indicated that M3 was primarily catalyzed by CYP2C9. Similar incubations with S-tofisopam indicated that the primary metabolite was due to demethylation of the methoxy group at the 7-position of the benzodiazepine ring (M1), and this reaction was catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4. The primary metabolites of both enantiomers were further demethylated to form a common didemethylated metabolite (M5) where the methoxy groups at positions 4 and 7 are demethylated. Analysis of plasma and urine samples from human clinical trials confirmed the in vitro observations. Subjects orally treated with 200 mg b.i.d. (R)-tofisopam had a 2-h M1/M3 plasma ratio of 1:29 and a ratio of 1:123 in urine, whereas patients orally administered (S)-tofisopam at 150 mg/kg t.i.d. had opposite M1 to M3 ratios of 8:1 in plasma and 6:1 in urine.",

Based on familial data, the patient was determined to be a member of a previously described family with benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME). The myoclonic status did not respond to benzodiazepines, but resolved after discontinuing the gabapentin. As for other idiopathic generalized epilepsies, gabapentin may precipitate myoclonic status in a benign syndrome, such as BAFME, as is reported herein for the first time. A correct diagnosis and prompt discontinuation of the drug may reverse a potentially severe, life-threatening condition.", 
    "29": "We clinically and clinicopathologically investigated the immobilizing and sedative effects of a medetomidine-midazolam (MM) combination in Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) and its antagonism with atipamezole. MM (medetomidine, 60 microg/kg; midazolam, 0.3 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly to each monkey (n = 11). All animals were laterally recumbent within 13 +/-6 min after administration of MM. This combination induced deep sedation accompanied by analgesia, muscle relaxation, and markedly depressed arousal reactions to external stimuli. After administration of atipamezole (240 microg/kg intramuscularly), the animals recovered rapidly and smoothly to their normal postures within 10 +/-2 min. In this study, the hematologic and serum biochemical parameters of Japanese monkeys given MM did not differ significantly from those of Japanese monkeys under general anesthesia via ketamine. Salivary a-amylase activities (stress indexes) ranged from 4 to 99 kU/l in Japanese monkeys, similar to levels measured in humans. An important advantage of MM was that its effects were reversible with atipamezole. We have confirmed that MM is valuable as a chemical restraint agent in Japanese monkeys for various experimental procedures.",

Both families of drugs were used as so-called hypnotics and sedatives, and later as minor tranquillizers. In addition these drugs were extensively used as self-medication. The careers show a cyclical temporal course and generally encompass three phases: first, an expanding use of the drugs, accompanied by high expectations; then, rising criticism and disappointment; and finally contracting use and limited application. These phases need not have been sequential: they often overlapped. The cycle sometimes ended by the disappearance of the drug from mental health care, only to be replaced by new drugs with a profile of promise and hope. These cycles, which we term Seige cycles, are generally typical for the careers of psychotropic drugs. The analytical concept of the Seige cycle facilitates a comparative perspective on the commonalities as well as the differences between the various drug careers under consideration.",

A review contains discussion about the basic elements of a concept of drug-facilitated sexual assault. There is also available information in regard to pharmacology of common data rape drugs, i.e. flunitrazepam, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and ketamine.

    "49": "Hyperekplexia (OMIM 149400) is an uncommon neurologic disorder characterized by exaggerated response to sensitive stimuli. It may be sporadic or familial. The disease is usually caused by mutations in the inhibitory glycine receptor alpha1-subunit. The authors report a male patient who is affected by the major form of familial hyperekplexia. He is currently 5 years old and is being successfully treated with clonazepam. Prenatal diagnosis was made owing to prior identification of point mutation K276E in his affected mother. Early diagnosis avoided complex and prolonged differential diagnostic procedures and allowed for early and effective intervention on severe neonatal symptoms: hypertonia, episodes of cyanosis, apneic spells, and massive myoclonic jerks. During his first year of life, the patient was treated with cycles of phenobarbital and diazepam and achieved partial clinical response. Subsequent therapy with low-dose clonazepam was highly effective in reducing myoclonic jerks and exaggerated startle reaction, and unlike previously used drugs, it was decisive in reducing hypertonia.", 
    "50": "Opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) is a key event in ischemia-reperfusion injury and several ligands of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein possibly associated with PTP, have been demonstrated as potent cardioprotective agents. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which the specific PBR ligand 4'-chlorodiazepam (CDZ) protected the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion. In either global or regional models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in rats, CDZ reduced infarct size in a dose-dependent manner (e.g., 11 +/- 1% of the area at risk at 10 mg/kg versus 31 +/- 3% in control; p < 0.05) and to a similar extent as ischemic or diazoxide-induced preconditioning. CDZ (10 mg/kg) reduced apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining), restored mitochondrial recovery, improved oxidative phosphorylation parameters, and reduced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization with inhibition of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor releases. CDZ increased the resistance of mitochondria to Ca2+-induced PTP opening. All these cardioprotective effects of CDZ were associated with an improved stabilization of the association of Bcl-2 with the mitochondrial membrane and inhibition of the association of a cytosolic fragment of Bax, occurring during ischemia-reperfusion, with the outer mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the PTP opener atractyloside (20 microM) and the Bcl-2 inhibitor ethyl-2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (HA14-1) (20 microM) abrogated CDZ-induced reduction of infarct size. These results demonstrate that PBR occupancy by CDZ renders the heart more resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury by limiting mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. This is due to a reorganization of the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family proteins at the level of mitochondrial membranes.", 
    "51": "Drugged drivers pose a serious threat to other people in traffic as well as to themselves. Reliable oral fluid screening devices for on-site screening of drugged drivers would be both a useful and convenient means for traffic control. In this study we evaluated the appropriateness of Drugwipe 5 and Drugwipe Benzodiazepines oral fluid on-site tests for roadside drug screening. Drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs were screened with the Drugwipe tests. Oral fluid and whole blood samples were collected from the drivers and tested for amphetamine-type stimulant drugs, cannabis, opiates, cocaine and benzodiazepines by immunological methods, GC and GC-MS. The performance evaluations of the tests were made by comparing the results of the Drugwipe tests with laboratory GC-MS confirmation results of oral fluid or whole blood. In addition to the performance evaluations of the Drugwipe tests based on laboratory results, a questionnaire on the practical aspects of the tests was written for the police officers who performed the tests. The aim of the questionnaire was to obtain user comments on the practicality of the tests as well as the advantages and weak points of the tests. The results of the performance evaluations were: for oral fluid (sensitivity; specificity; accuracy) amphetamines (95.5%; 92.9%; 95.3%), cannabis (52.2%; 91.2%; 85.1%), cocaine (50.0%; 99.3%; 98.6%), opiates (100%; 95.8%; 95.9%), benzodiazepines (74.4%; 84.2%; 79.2%) and for whole blood accordingly, amphetamines (97.7%; 86.7%; 95.9%), cannabis (68.3%; 87.9%; 84.9%), cocaine (50.0%; 98.5%; 97.7%), opiates (87.5%; 96.9%; 96.6%) and benzodiazepines (66.7%; 87.0%; 74.4%).

    "63": "To measure the long-term changes in weight and plasma lipids after switching antipsychotic treatment to ziprasidone, three 52-week, open-label extension studies of ziprasidone in outpatients (N=185) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder successfully completing one of three, 6-week switch studies were carried out. Pre-switch treatment consisted of risperidone (n=43), olanzapine (n=71), or conventional antipsychotic agents (n=71). The maximum length of exposure to ziprasidone was 58 weeks. Nonfasting total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were obtained at baseline and at weeks 6, 19, 32, 45, and 58. Weight was measured at baseline and during each follow-up visit; height was recorded at baseline for the purpose of body mass index (BMI) calculation. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale which were obtained at baseline and major follow-up points. Clinically significant sustained improvements in weight, BMI, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were observed among patients switched to ziprasidone from risperidone or olanzapine. Switching from conventional antipsychotics was not associated with significant changes in weight and lipid parameters. Mean reductions in weight from baseline to study endpoint were 9.8 kg (p<0.001) and 6.9 kg (p<0.005) for patients previously treated with olanzapine and risperidone, respectively. These findings demonstrate that switching from risperidone or olanzapine to ziprasidone is associated with sustained, clinically significant improvements in weight and plasma lipids.",

    "68": "Galanin's influence on monoaminergic neurotransmission, together with its discrete CNS distribution in corticolimbic brain areas, points to a potential role for this neuropeptide in mediating anxiety- and depression-like responses. To evaluate this hypothesis, the non-selective galanin receptor agonist, galnon, was tested in multiple preclinical models of anxiolytic- and antidepressive-like activity. Acute administration of galnon (0.03-1mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased punished crossings in the four plate test, with magnitude similar to the effects of the endogenous ligand, galanin (0.1-1.0 microg, i.c.v.). Moreover, the effects of galnon and galanin were blocked by central administration of the non-selective galanin receptor antagonist, M35 (10 microg, i.c.v.). Interestingly, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (1mg/kg, i.p.), reversed galnon's effect in the four plate test, implicating GABAergic neurotransmission as a potential mechanism underlying this anxiolytic-like response. In the elevated zero maze, galnon (0.3-3.0mg/kg, i.p.) and galanin (0.03-0.3 microg, i.c.v.) increased the time spent in the open arms, while in the stress-induced hyperthermia model, galnon (0.3-30 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated stress-induced changes in body temperature. Consistent with these anxiolytic-like effects, in vivo microdialysis showed that acute galnon (3mg/kg, i.p.) treatment preferentially elevated levels of GABA in the rat amygdala, a brain area linked to fear and anxiety behaviors. In contrast to the effects in anxiety models, neither galnon (1-5.6 mg/kg, i.p.) nor galanin (0.3-3.0 microg, i.c.v.) demonstrated antidepressant-like effects in the mouse tail suspension test. Galnon (1-10mg/kg, i.p.) also failed to reduce immobility time in the rat forced swim test. In vitro, galnon and galanin showed affinity for human galanin receptors expressed in Bowes melanoma cells (K(i)=5.5 microM and 0.2 nM, respectively). Galanin displayed high affinity and functional potency for membranes expressing rat GALR1 receptors (K(i)=0.85 nM; EC(50)=0.6 nM), while galnon (10 microM) failed to displace radiolabeled galanin or inhibit cAMP production in the same GALR1 cell line. Galnon (10 microM) showed affinity for NPY1, NK2, M5, and somatostatin receptors but no affinity for galanin receptors expressed in rat hippocampal membranes. Taken together, the present series of studies demonstrate novel effects of galnon in various preclinical models of anxiety and highlight the galaninergic system as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders. Moreover, these data indicate rodent GALR1 receptors do not mediate galnon's in vivo activity.",

    "96": "Transgenic R6/2 mice carrying the Huntington's disease (HD) mutation show disrupted circadian rhythms that worsen as the disease progresses. By 15 weeks of age, their abnormal circadian behavior mirrors that seen in HD patients and is accompanied by dysregulated clock gene expression in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). We found, however, that the electrophysiological output of the SCN assayed in vitro was normal. Furthermore, the endogenous rhythm of circadian gene expression, monitored in vitro by luciferase imaging of organotypical SCN slices removed from mice with disintegrated behavioral rhythms, was also normal. We concluded that abnormal behavioral and molecular circadian rhythms observed in R6/2 mice in vivo arise from dysfunction of brain circuitry afferent to the SCN, rather than from a primary deficiency within the pacemaker itself. Because circadian sleep disruption is deleterious to cognitive function, and cognitive decline is pronounced in R6/2 mice, we tested whether circadian and cognitive disturbances could be reversed by using a sedative drug to impose a daily cycle of sleep in R6/2 mice. Daily treatment with Alprazolam reversed the dysregulated expression of Per2 and also Prok2, an output factor of the SCN that controls behavioral rhythms. It also markedly improved cognitive performance of R6/2 mice in a two-choice visual discrimination task. Together, our data show for the first time that treatments aimed at restoring circadian rhythms may not only slow the cognitive decline that is such a devastating feature of HD but may also improve other circadian gene-regulated functions that are impaired in this disease.", 
    "97": "Axonal growth cones are responsible for the correct guidance of developing axons and the establishment of functional neural networks. They are highly motile because of fast and continuous rearrangements of their actin-rich cytoskeleton. Here we have used live imaging of axonal growth cones of hippocampal neurons in culture and quantified their motility with a temporal resolution of 2 s. Using novel methods of analysis of growth cone dynamics, we show that transient activation of kainate receptors by bath-applied kainate induced a fast and reversible growth cone stalling. This effect depends on electrical activity and can be mimicked by the transient discharge of action potentials elicited in the neuron by intracellular current injections at the somatic level through a patch pipette. Growth cone stalling induced by electrical stimulation is mediated by calcium entry from the extracellular medium as well as by calcium release from intracellular stores that define spatially restricted microdomains directly affecting cytoskeletal dynamics. We propose that growth cone motility is dynamically controlled by transient bursts of spontaneous electrical activity, which constitutes a prominent feature of developing neural networks in vivo.", 
    "98": "Atypical antipsychotics will continue to be prescribed for the behavioral symptoms of dementia in the absence of more effective, better tolerated, and safer alternatives. The evidence base, although incomplete, suggests that modest treatment effect sizes are offset by risk of considerable adverse effects. How might this information be best applied to clinical practice? Non-pharmacologic strategies should be implemented in routine clinical practice. Placebo-controlled clinical trials of individual antipsychotic agents have historically reported high placebo response rates; CATIE-AD reported that the sum total of the risk/benefit equation of atypical antipsychotic therapy was no greater than that achieved by placebo. CATIE-AD was designed to study the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic treatment in community dwelling patients with AD. It is uncertain whether the results can be generalized to the populations of dementia patients residing in nursing homes with more severe cognitive and behavioral impairment. There is some suggestion that nursing home patients with dementia complicated by severe behavioral symptoms, particularly agitation and aggression without accompanying psychosis, might achieve greater benefit from atypical antipsychotic treatment than patients with milder behavioral symptoms. The finding that dementia patients without psychosis may respond more robustly to antipsychotic treatment seems counterintuitive, but may support the hypothesis that the neurobiology of the \"psychosis of AD\" differs from the psychosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disease. Adverse effects associated with antipsychotic therapy should be aggressively monitored throughout therapy. Treatment-emergent sedation was associated with all of the atypical antipsychotics in CATIE-AD and is probably an important mediator of mortality risk in patients with dementia. Sedation exacerbates pre-existing cognitive impairment and increases the risk of complications such as aspiration pneumonia, so concomitant use of benzodiazepines should be discouraged or limited to short periods with careful observation.' Once initiated, the effectiveness and tolerability of antipsychotic therapy should be evaluated routinely. In Alzheimer's disease, the severity and frequency of behavioral symptoms often decreases as illness progresses. In a stable patient, it is prudent to attempt to taper and discontinue the antipsychotic after 2-8 months of therapy. Better understanding of the potential adverse effects of antipsychotic therapy has increased interest in the effects of the dementia-specific medications on behavioral symptoms. Reductions in neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported from trials of individual cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine monotherapy, and memantine combined with donepezil in AD patients. Studies of small numbers of patients in open trials of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and one double-blind placebo controlled trial (rivastigmine) have reported varying degrees of improvement of behavioral symptoms and psychosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and agitation/aggression are cited as the symptom categories most likely to show significant improvement. Since few of these studies were prospectively designed to study behavioral symptoms, results must be interpreted cautiously. Treatment of behavioral symptoms in AD and other dementias is challenging. The limitations of current approaches drive the search for effective, well tolerated therapies.", 
    "99": "The role of the mitochondrial Na/Ca-exchanger (mNCX) in hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and pretreated with cardioplegia (CPG) was studied from a mechano-calorimetric approach. No-flow ischemia (ISCH) and reperfusion (REP) were developed in isolated rat hearts pretreated with 10 micromol/L clonazepam (CLZP), an inhibitor of the mNCX, and (or) a high K+ - low Ca2+ solution (CPG). Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), pressure development during beats (P), and the steady heat release (Ht) were continuously measured and muscle contents of ATP and PCr were analyzed at the end of REP. During REP, Ht increased more than P, reducing muscle economy (P/Ht) and the ATP content. CPG induced an increase in P recovery during REP (to 90% +/- 10% of preISCH) with respect to nonpretreated hearts (control, C, to 64% +/- 10%, p < 0.05). In contrast, CLZP reduced P recovery of CPG-hearts (50% +/- 6.4%, p < 0.05) and increased LVEDP in C hearts. To evaluate effects on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function, ischemic hearts were reperfused with 10 mmol/L caffeine -36 mmol/L Na (C - caff - low Na). It increased LVEDP, which afterwards slowly relaxed, whereas Ht increased (by about 6.5 mW/g). CLZP sped up the relaxation with higher DeltaHt, C - caff - low Na produced higher contracture and lower Ht in perfused than in ischemic hearts. Values of DeltaHt were compared with reported fluxes of Ca2+-transporters, suggesting that mitochondria may be in part responsible for the DeltaHt during C - caff - low Na REP. Results suggest that ISCH-REP reduced the SR store for the recovery of contractility, but induced Ca2+ movement from the mitochondria to the SR stores. Also, mitochondria and SR are able to remove cytosolic Ca2+ during overloads (as under caffeine), through the mNCX and the uniporter. CPG increases Ca2+ cycling from mitochondria to the SR, which contributes to the higher recovery of P. In contrast, CLZP produces a deleterious effect on ISCH-REP associated with higher heat release and reduced resynthesis of high energy phosphates, which suggests the induction of mitochondrial Ca cycling and uncoupling.", 
    "100": "Although most patients treated for first-episode schizophrenia will experience considerable improvement with initial antipsychotic therapy, a subgroup experiences significant ongoing positive symptoms. Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia, but its role in the treatment of first-episode patients remains unclear. A standardized treatment algorithm was implemented in our First Episode Psychosis Program, with patients receiving 2 trials with 2 second-generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone at low, medium, and high doses), followed by a trial of clozapine as early as 25 weeks into the start of their treatment. Patients progress along the algorithm according to their response as defined by clinical rating scales. To date, 123 patients with first-episode schizophrenia have been treated according to the algorithm. Of these, 93 (76%) responded to the first trial of an antipsychotic. Only 7 (23%) of the remaining 30 patients responded to a second antipsychotic trial; 13 of the remaining 23 individuals agreed to a trial of clozapine. We compared the clozapine-treated group with a group of 9 patients who refused clozapine and chose to continue the same antipsychotic treatment as before. Subjects who received clozapine experienced a mean Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale change of 19 points (from 53.5 to 34.5) and a change in the Clinical Global Inventory severity rating from 5.4 to 3.5 (from severely ill to mildly ill); those who refused clozapine had a 2-point increase in mean Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (from 53 to 55) and a 0.6-point increase in the mean Clinical Global Inventory severity rating from 5.4 to 6 (remaining markedly to severely ill). In clinical practice, there is a hesitancy to switch individuals to clozapine given its side effect profile and position as treatment of \"last resort.\" The present findings suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients whose psychosis does not remit with other second-generation antipsychotics during the first months of treatment.",

Weight gain was the only common (> or =10%) adverse event that occurred more frequently, although not significantly differently, in the olanzapine group (27.7%) than the chlorpromazine group (12.5%), whereas postural hypotension was the only common adverse event whose occurrence was significantly different between the groups (olanzapine, 0.0%; chlorpromazine, 10.0%; P = 0.010). Both the incidence of > or =7% weight gain from baseline (olanzapine, 26.3%; chlorpromazine, 24.3%) and baseline-to-end point changes in weight (mean +/- SD, kg: olanzapine, 3.41 +/- 3.14; chlorpromazine, 2.81 +/- 2.65) were not significantly different between the treatment groups. Baseline-to- end point changes in nonfasting glucose differed significantly between the groups (mean +/- SD, mmol/L: olanzapine, 0.09 +/- 1.11; chlorpromazine, 0.72 +/- 2.04; P = 0.042). This analysis suggests that, compared with chlorpromazine, olanzapine may be more efficacious and have a more favorable tolerability profile in treating patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "102": "One of the main functions of the translocator protein (18 kDa) or TSPO, previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is the regulation of cholesterol import into mitochondria for steroid biosynthesis. In this paper we show that TSPO ligands induce changes in the distribution of intracellular cholesterol in astrocytes and fibroblasts. NBD-cholesterol, a fluorescent analog of cholesterol, was rapidly removed from membranes and accumulated into lipid droplets. This change was followed by a block of cholesterol esterification, but not by modification of intracellular cholesterol synthesis. NBD-cholesterol droplets were in part released in the medium, and increased cholesterol efflux was observed in [(3)H]cholesterol-prelabeled cells. TSPO ligands also induced a prominent shrinkage and depolarization of mitochondria and depletion of acidic vesicles with cytoplasmic acidification. Consistent with NBD-cholesterol changes, MTT assay showed enhanced accumulation of formazan into lipid droplets and inhibition of formazan exocytosis after treatment with TSPO ligands. The effects of specific TSPO ligands PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 were reproduced by diazepam, which binds with high affinity both TSPO and central benzodiazepine receptors, but not by clonazepam, which binds exclusively to GABA receptor, and other amphiphilic substances such as DIDS and propranolol. All these effects and the parallel immunocytochemical detection of TSPO in potentially steroidogenic cells (astrocytes) and non-steroidogenic cells (fibroblasts) suggest that TSPO is involved in the regulation and trafficking of intracellular cholesterol by means of mechanisms not necessarily related to steroid biosynthesis.", 
    "103": "Alprazolam is widely used as a short-acting antidepressant and anxiolytic agent and its effect appears at very low doses while ethanol is used as a social drug worldwide. Sometimes, toxic interactions occur following combined administration of these two drugs. In this study we have investigated the interaction between ethanol and high-dose alprazolam using human liver microsomes in vitro. The interaction effects between ethanol and alprazolam were examined by a mixed-function oxidation reaction using a human liver microsomal preparation. Alprazolam and its two main metabolites (alpha-hydroxyalprazolam: alpha-OH alprazolam, 4-hydroxyalprazolam: 4-OH alprazolam) were measured by HPLC/UV. The production of 4-OH alprazolam, one main metabolite of alprazolam, was weakly inhibited by higher dose of ethanol, but not alpha-OH alprazolam. These results using a human liver microsomal preparation show that the production of 4-OH alprazolam is weakly inhibited by ethanol but not alpha-OH alprazolam. Toxic levels may be reached by simultaneous administration of ethanol and high-dose alprazolam.", 
    "104": "Previous studies of benztropine analogues have found them to inhibit dopamine uptake like cocaine, but with less effectiveness than cocaine in producing behavioral effects related to drug abuse. Studies have assessed whether nonselective muscarinic antagonists decrease the effects of cocaine because many of the benztropine analogues are also muscarinic antagonists. As previous studies were conducted with nonselective muscarinic antagonists and the benztropine analogues show preferential affinity for the M(1) muscarinic receptor subtype, the present study examined interactions of cocaine and the preferential M(1) antagonists, telenzepine (TZP) and trihexyphenidyl (TXP) on subjective effects in rats trained to discriminate cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline injections. Cocaine dose-dependently increased the percentage of responses on the cocaine-appropriate lever, with full substitution at the training dose. In contrast neither TZP nor TXP produced more than 25% cocaine-appropriate responding at any dose. Both M(1) antagonists produced significant leftward shifts in the cocaine dose-effect curve, TZP at 3.0 and TXP at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg. The present results indicate that preferential antagonist actions at muscarinic M(1) receptors enhance rather than attenuate the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine, and thus those actions unlikely contribute to the reduced cocaine-like effects of BZT analogues.",

Eighty-three percent of the sample had at least one drug claim during the year. Prescribed drugs came from 125 different therapeutic classes. The seven most frequently prescribed classes of psychoactive drugs were antidepressants, stimulants, tranquilizers/antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, hypotensive agents, anxiolytic/sedative/hypnotics, and benzodiazepines. The data on other relevant diagnoses indicate that children and youth are frequently treated with medication under an autism-spectrum diagnosis, even though the target symptoms may be commonly associated with other mental disorders. Age data indicate that about 70% of children with autism-spectrum disorders age 8 yr and up receive some form of psychoactive medication in a given year.",

    "110": "The primary products of one-electron oxidation of clozapine and olanzapine, very effective atypical antipsychotic drugs, have been spectroscopically characterized. The oxidation process has been studied under glassy matrix conditions and by a pulse radiolysis technique in aqueous solution. The rate constants for the oxidation of clozapine with dibromide radical anion ( k = 2 x 10 (9) M (-1) s (-1)) and azide radical ( k = 2.3 x 10 (9) M (-1) s (-1)) in aqueous solution were measured. The computational DFT results support the identification of the transient species. The mechanistic aspects of reactivity of radical cations, radicals, and nitrenium cations have been investigated. A disproportionation reaction ( k > or = 1 x 10 (8) M (-1) s (-1)) was proposed as a link between the products of one-electron oxidation and formation of the nitrenium cations of clozapine and olanzapine, products likely responsible for the pathogenesis of adverse drug reactions. The rate constants for the reactions of nitrenium cation of clozapine with glutathione ( k = 3.4 x 10 (4) M (-1) s (-1)) and cysteine ( k = 9.8 x 10 (4) M (-1) s (-1)) were determined.",

    "112": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether platelet serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) binding sites and inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) concentrations before treatment can identify olanzapine-responsive patients. The study included 21 never medicated, first-episode schizophrenia patients (antipsychotic-na\u00efve) and 21 patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia who had not received depot antipsychotic treatment in the previous 6 months or oral antipsychotic or antidepressant treatment in the previous 2 months (antipsychotic-free). In the antipsychotic-na\u00efve group, olanzapine responders had a significantly lower number of 5-HT2A receptors and lower IP3 concentrations at baseline than non-responders. The combination of baseline 5-HT2A and IP3 values significantly predicted an improvement in negative symptomatology after 6 weeks of treatment with olanzapine. In the antipsychotic-free group, responders had significantly higher positive and lower negative symptomatology at baseline, together with a reduced number of 5-HT2A receptors. However, basal 5-HT2A receptors or IP3 concentrations did not significantly predict positive, negative or general clinical response. The reported results suggest that platelet 5-HT2A binding might be a trait marker that could help to identify those patients likely to show greater improvement in negative symptomatology after olanzapine treatment.", 
    "113": "Neurocognitive impairment is a core feature in the pathology of schizophrenia and considered to be relatively persistent towards psychopharmacological interventions. There are hints that atypical antipsychotics can influence neurocognitive dysfunctions more favorable than conventional compounds. But little is known about differences in efficacy on neurocognitive dysfunctions linked to the variety of receptor profiles of different atypical antipsychotics. This study compared the effects of the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine and olanzapine on cognitive function in patients with an acute episode of schizophrenia. Patients were randomized to receive quetiapine or olanzapine for 8 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline, week 4 and week 8. Efficacy was assessed weekly using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI). Tolerability was assessed each week using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale (UKU). In total, 52 patients were enrolled in the study. Data from the 33 patients who completed cognitive assessments at two or more time points out of three (baseline, Week 4 and Week 8) are analyzed here. Both quetiapine and olanzapine improved global cognitive index z-scores, however, this was more marked with quetiapine. Between-group comparisons showed significantly greater improvements in reaction quality/attention with quetiapine than olanzapine. Quetiapine and olanzapine produced significant improvements from baseline to week 8 in PANSS total and subscale scores. Both treatments were well tolerated, especially no EPS occurred during 8 weeks of treatment. Both quetiapine and olanzapine improved cognition; however, the improvement in cognitive index scores was more marked in patients receiving quetiapine. Furthermore, quetiapine produced a significantly greater improvement in reaction quality/attention than olanzapine.",

    "116": "The ileum contracted in response to soy extract in a concentration-dependent manner. This response was unaffected by the nerve blocker tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) but was completely inhibited by atropine (10(-9) M), indicating an action via muscarinic receptors on the muscle. In the presence of the M(3) muscarinic antagonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide and to a lesser extent in the presence of the M(2) muscarinic antagonist 11-([2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one, the response was decreased. When acetylcholine (ACh) esterase inhibitors were added to the medium before the addition of soy extract, the response to the extract was potentiated. Preincubation of the extract with exogenous ACh esterase reduced its activity. The response to choline, ACh, and phosphorylcholine was also tested, and none of these substances accurately replicated the response to soy extract. However, some qualitative similarities were observed between the effect of choline and ACh to that of the extract.", 
    "117": "These results indicate the presence of an ACh-like substance in soy. Due to the abundance and importance of muscarinic receptors, the presence of a cholinergic substance in soy could have numerous implications.

    "118": "The effects on latent inhibition (LI; a delay in conditioning when a CS has been pre-exposed without consequences) of repeated restraint stress and the anxiolytic drug diazepam were examined in C57BL/6 mice to know whether previous aversive events or anxiolysis are factors determining the expression of LI. The LI model was optimized for this strain particularly sensitive to stress (using both the CER and the conditioned freezing procedures) and characterized with typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine and olanzapine) antipsychotic drugs administered either during the conditioning or the pre-exposure phases. An acute challenge with amphetamine, a dopamine releaser, was done to verify the enhancement of hyperactivity in C57BL/6 mice after the restraint stress sensitization. At all doses tested, diazepam decreased latent inhibition when administered during the pre-exposure phase (similarly to atypical antipsychotic drugs). Repeated restraint stress enhanced LI by blocking the CS-induced freezing in pre-exposed mice. In contrast, pre-treatment with diazepam before pre-exposure allowed the expression of CS-induced freezing in stressed mice pre-exposed to the tone. It is suggested that stress and anxiolytic drugs can have opposite effects on attention or perseveration processes during learning of conflicting contingency responses.",

Validation studies were conducted with chlorpromazine, amphetamine, diazepam or clonidine given orally to rats or mice, in order to assess if this methodology could clearly differentiate the profile of effects produced by these compounds. The analysis of data from 80 control rats allowed for the assessment of the normal behaviour in order to characterise the inter-individual, daytime-related variability and the habituation of animals to the procedure.", 
    "121": "The reference compounds induced their typical and expected transient effects on neurobehaviour, observed both in the home cage and open-arena, and on body temperature. In particular, amphetamine induced a stimulation of the nervous system activities and marked hyperthermia. Chlorpromazine, diazepam and clonidine induced depressive, anxiolytic or sedative effects associated with hypothermia. The analysis of data collected in control animals allowed for the identification of 6 signs which scored differently from the assigned normality at the first handling occasion due to the characteristic fear reactions to the unknown, and 9 signs at 8 h post-dose due to the animal's habituation to experimental conditions and handling.",

Aim of this study was to investigate plasma lipids, lipoproteins and some hormones levels during olanzapine treatment in patients with psychosis. The study population comprised twenty nine patients (29) diagnosed with psychosis and eleven patients (11) with endogenous depression. Plasma cholesterol, triglicerides, phospholipids, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and hormones - prolactin, cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and estradiol were measured by auto-analyzer and by classic photometric methods. All measurements were performed before and during one-year treatment with olanzapine and antidepressant. Treatment of the schizophrenic patients with olanzapine caused a great metabolic impact that is primarily expressed in body mass, cholesterol increase and statistically significant rise of BMI, respectively. Body mass increase could be explained by the fact that olanzapine blocked not only dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, alpha-adrenergic but histaminergic receptors as well.",

The sartorius muscle showed obvious enlargement of the nucleus, small and degenerated myofibrils, small, few and disorganized mitochondria, decrease of glycogen granules increase of fat vacuoles and destruction and dilation of SR, large interfibrillar spaces. Moreover, sartorius muscle revealed increase and vacuolation of connective tissue between the muscle fibers. Connective tissue contained dilated and congested blood capillaries, macrophages and many fibroblasts. In addition, disorganized myoneural junctions were noticed. Empty and dilated axons were noticed at the myoneural junction.",

    "126": "The objective of this article is to illustrate both the potential and the limitations of molecular imaging in stroke research. By molecular imaging we mean the visual representation of biological processes at the cellular and molecular level. The use of molecular imaging for stroke diagnosis is still at a very preliminary stage and many of these procedures have only been tested in animals. In rats, stroke therapy using stem cells can be monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase (LUC) imaging. The migration of macrophages, which take up intravenously administered iron-based contrast agents and then migrate to the area of infarction, can already be observed in stroke patients. With MRI, the new agent Gd-DTPA-sLexA that binds to E- and P-selectin can specifically visualize selectin-mediated early endothelial activation after transient focal ischemia \"in vivo\". Decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene expression can be imaged in vivo by scintigraphy 24 hours after cerebral ischemia using a peptide nucleic acid antisense conjugate labeled with 111In and that hybridizes to the rat GFAP mRNA. Technetium-99m hydrazine nicotinamide-labeled HYNIC-annexin V SPECT can not only detect sites of neuronal injury in stroke patients but also can monitor the effects of neuroprotective therapy with a monoclonal antibody raised against FasLigand (FasL) in rats. Finally, information about cell metabolism in the infarct region can be gained using certain intracellular tracers [e.g. 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)]. Imaging benzodiazepine receptors with 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) can distinguish between irreversibly damaged and viable penumbra tissue early after stroke.",

The standard for treating solid tumor cancer is surgical resection. However, it has been suggested that surgical resection may, in fact, promote metastasis. One of the body's natural defenses to combat metastasis is the activity of natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells serve as a vital mediator of detection during the early innate immune response and destruction of aberrant cells. It has been demonstrated that benzodiazepines may ameliorate surgery-induced suppression of NK cell activity. We examined the effect of a 14-day course of valerian, a herbal anxiolytic, on NK cell activity in Sprague-Dawley rats.",

    "131": "Complex changes in GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy during the chronic period include a decrease in the delta subunit and increases in the alpha4 and gamma2 subunits in the dentate gyrus. We used postembedding immunogold labeling to determine whether the subcellular locations of these subunits were also altered in pilocarpine-treated epileptic mice, and related functional changes were identified electrophysiologically. The ultrastructural studies confirmed a decrease in delta subunit labeling at perisynaptic locations in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus where these subunits are critical for tonic inhibition. Unexpectedly, tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells was maintained in the epileptic mice, suggesting compensation by other GABA(A)Rs. An insensitivity of the tonic current to the neurosteroid tetrahydrodeoxy-corticosterone was consistent with decreased expression of the delta subunit. In the pilocarpine-treated mice, alpha4 subunit labeling remained at perisynaptic locations, but increased gamma2 subunit labeling was also found at many perisynaptic locations on granule cell dendrites, consistent with a shift of the gamma2 subunit from synaptic to perisynaptic locations and potential partnership of the alpha4 and gamma2 subunits in the epileptic animals. The decreased gamma2 labeling near the center of synaptic contacts was paralleled by a corresponding decrease in the dendritic phasic inhibition of granule cells in the pilocarpine-treated mice. These GABA(A)R subunit changes appear to impair both tonic and phasic inhibition, particularly at granule cell dendrites, and could reduce the adaptive responses of the GABA system in temporal lobe epilepsy.", 
    "132": "Benzodiazepines are widely used drugs. They exert sedative/hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects and act through a specific high affinity binding site on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor. Ligands of the benzodiazepine-binding site are classified into three groups depending on their mode of action: positive and negative allosteric modulators and antagonists. To rationally design ligands of the benzodiazepine site in different isoforms of the GABA(A) receptor, we need to understand the relative positioning and overlap of modulators of different allosteric properties. To solve these questions, we used a proximity-accelerated irreversible chemical coupling reaction. GABA(A) receptor residues thought to reside in the benzodiazepine-binding site were individually mutated to cysteine and combined with a cysteine-reactive benzodiazepine site ligand. Direct apposition of reaction partners is expected to lead to a covalent reaction. We describe here such a reaction of predominantly alpha(1)H101C and also three other mutants (alpha(1)G157C, alpha(1)V202C, and alpha(1)V211C) with an Imid-NCS derivative in which a reactive isothiocyanate group (-NCS) replaces the azide group (-N(3)) in the partial negative allosteric modulator Ro15-4513. Our results show four contact points of imidazobenzodiazepines with the receptor, alpha(1)H101C being shared by classical benzodiazepines. Taken together with previous data, a similar orientation of these ligands within the benzodiazepine-binding pocket may be proposed.",

The global problem of identifying drugged drivers has also led to an increase in oral fluid testing at the roadside. The main requirements for the implementation of roadside drug testing are a rapid sample collection time, collection of a known sample volume and recovery of drugs from the collection device. We report here the development of the Cozart DDS oral fluid collector, an oral fluid collector that combines rapid and adequate sample collection with satisfactory drug recovery. Oral fluid was collected from drug users (n=134) and drug-free individuals (n=137), using the Cozart DDS oral fluid collector. The mean time for the completion of collection (full coloration of the sample presence indicator) was 34 s for drug-free individuals and 44 s for drug users. The average volume collected was 0.34 mL (n=271). No chemical stimulant (to induce salivation) was used to achieve the collection times observed in either the drug-free or the drug-taking sample populations. Drugs were extracted from the collector using the Cozart DDS buffer and drug recovery was determined by Cozart enzyme immunoassays. The recovery studies showed that for amphetamine, Delta(9)THC, cocaine, methadone, methamphetamine, morphine and temazepam over 90% of the drug in the sample was eluted from the collector. The Cozart DDS oral fluid collector provides a reliable mechanism for the collection of oral fluid at the roadside that achieves the rapid collection times required.",

    "148": "High dose diazepam was associated with time-dependent increases in the intensity of subjective drug effects (strength of drug effect, sedation) and decreases in psychological performance (reaction time, DSST) for both methadone and buprenorphine patients. These effects were generally independent of the opioid dose administered. High dose opioid administration (150% normal dose) was associated with reductions in overall SpO2 levels and performance (reaction time, DSST) in the methadone patients, but had virtually no impact on pharmacodynamic responses in the buprenorphine group.",

    "150": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is located mainly in the outer mitochondrial membrane and many functions are associated directly or indirectly with the PBR. We have studied the influence of different durations of warm ischemia (WI) on renal function, tissue damage and PBR expression in a Large Whitepig model. After a midline incision, the renal pedicle was clamped for 10 (WI10), 30 (WI30), 45 (WI45), 60 (WI60) or 90 min (WI90), and blood and renal tissue samples were collected between 1 day and 2 weeks after reperfusion for assessment of renal function. Metabolite excretion associated with renal ischemia reperfusion injury such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) was quantified in blood by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. PBR mRNA and protein expression were determined in renal tissue. TMAO levels rose progressively and significantly with increasing duration of WI. PBR mRNA expression was upregulated between 3 h and 1 day after reperfusion in WI30, WI45 and WI60. Its upregulation was noted 3 days after reperfusion in WI90. At day 14, PBR transcript expression was not different from basal level in any group. PBR protein followed the same pattern. These findings suggest a new role for PBR which could be a major target in the regeneration process during ischemia reperfusion.", 
    "151": "ECO-4601 is a structurally novel farnesylated dibenzodiazepinone discovered through DECIPHER technology, Thallion's proprietary drug discovery platform. The compound was shown to have a broad cytotoxic activity in the low micromolar range when tested in the NCI 60 cell line panel. In the work presented here, ECO-4601 was further evaluated against brain tumor cell lines. Preliminary mechanistic studies as well as in vivo antitumor evaluation were performed.", 
    "152": "Since ECO-4601 has a benzodiazepinone moiety, we first investigated if it binds the central and/or peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. ECO-4601 was tested in radioligand binding assays on benzodiazepine receptors obtained from rat hearts. The ability of ECO-4601 to inhibit the growth of CNS cancers was evaluated on a panel of mouse, rat and human glioma cell lines using a standard MTT assay. Antitumor efficacy studies were performed on gliomas (rat and human), human breast and human prostate mouse tumor xenografts. Antitumor activity and pharmacokinetic analysis of ECO-4601 was evaluated following intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), and intraperitoneal (i.p.) bolus administrations.", 
    "153": "ECO-4601 was shown to bind the peripheral but not the central benzodiazepine receptor and inhibited the growth of CNS tumor cell lines. Bolus s.c. and i.p. administration gave rise to low but sustained drug exposure, and resulted in moderate to significant antitumor activity at doses that were well tolerated. In a rat glioma (C6) xenograft model, ECO-4601 produced up to 70% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) while in a human glioma (U-87MG) xenograft, TGI was 34%. Antitumor activity was highly significant in both human hormone-independent breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC-3) xenografts, resulting in TGI of 72 and 100%, respectively. On the other hand, i.v. dosing was followed by rapid elimination of the drug and was ineffective.", 
    "154": "Antitumor efficacy of ECO-4601 appears to be associated with the exposure parameter AUC and/or sustained drug levels rather than C (max). These in vivo data constitute a rationale for clinical studies testing prolonged continuous administration of ECO-4601.",

    "157": "This was a double-blind, crossover design study of acute oral doses of lorazepam (2 mg) and placebo, using young healthy volunteers. We focused on response delay of three separable phases of deductive reasoning and matched working memory tasks (that involved only maintenance of information) the premise processing phase, the premise integration phase, and the validation phase, in which reasoners decide whether a conclusion logically follows from the premises (reasoning task) or is identical to one of the premises (maintenance task). Type of relations in the premises was also manipulated. We employed material that was difficult to envisage visually and visuospatially (\"subiconic\") and material easy to envisage visually or visuospatially.", 
    "158": "Lorazepam slowed response as memory load increased, irrespective of type of relations. It also specifically slowed validation in reasoning problems with visual relations, an effect that disappeared after subtraction of maintenance scores, and increased validation time in problems with subiconic relations, which remained after this subtraction.",

The decedents were mostly male (92%), with a variety of occupations including laborers (76.9%), traders (15.4%), and student (7.7%). The causes of death were mainly traffic injuries (33%), gunshot wounds (26%) and others (stab wound, poisoning, asphyxia etc 41%). The manner of death was accidents in 40% and homicides in 28%.",

Homicide by gunshot wounds was the most common cause of death at 69.2%, followed by hanging (15.4%), electrocution (7.7%), and poisoning (7.7%). The concentration of methamphetamine in urine was between 501-61,147 ng/ml, which cannot be correlated with intoxication. There were no deaths from overdose. Three Benzodiazepine, one toluene, and one meperidine cases were also found in cases of methamphetamine abuse. Alcohol was found mostly in the persons with unnatural deaths (53.6%) from traffic accidents.",

    "164": "Seizures constitute the most common neurological symptom in the neonatal period. Treatment usually involves the administration of intravenous benzodiazepines followed by either phenobarbital or phenytoin. For nonresponsive cases, continuous intravenous drip of either midazolam or lidocaine has been suggested for seizure control. Some reports suggest that seizures themselves may have a deleterious effect on long-term neurological outcome. Therefore, there is a need to find treatment regimens with better efficacy to provide maximum seizure control. The authors compared the effectiveness of lidocaine and midazolam in the treatment of intractable seizures in newborn infants born at or after 36 weeks of gestation who suffered from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and who had their cerebral activity monitored. Thirty infants were included in the study: 22 received lidocaine, and 8 received midazolam. Seventeen (77%) infants had a good or partial response to lidocaine, and 4 (50%) had a partial response to midazolam. Of 20 infants diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy grade 2, 18 (90%) responded to second-line treatment (14 [93%] of 15 to lidocaine and 4 [80%] of 5 to midazolam). Among 10 infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy grade 3, only 3 (30%) responded to second-line treatment (all 3 to lidocaine, none to midazolam). The findings suggest that lidocaine may be more effective than midazolam in reducing or controlling refractory neonatal seizures. The lower response rate to midazolam was more evident in infants with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (grade 3).",

    "167": "Considerable progress is being made with a number of innovative techniques. Oral midazolam for children and patient-controlled propofol show very promising results. More research is needed before propofol can be recommended for use without anaesthetic staff. The recently published systematic review of sedation in children outlines gaps in the literature and contains recommendations for future work.", 
    "168": "Most patients require sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy. Moderate sedation for these procedures has traditionally been provided by the endoscopist with benzodiazepine and/or a narcotic. As endoscopy has increased in numbers and complexity, however, more effective sedation and analgesia is frequently required. Controversy has ensued over safe and efficient sedation practice. This review seeks to delineate what has been learned about this topic in the recent literature.", 
    "169": "There has been an increase both in the number of endoscopic procedures performed and in the use of propofol for endoscopic sedation. Studies have focused on several basic issues: alternatives to anesthesiologist-supervised propofol, other sedation regimens, and complications related to sedation.", 
    "170": "Alternatives to anesthesiologist-supervised propofol include nurse-administered propofol sedation supervised by the endoscopist, and patient controlled sedation. While other sedative regimens continue to be examined, the use of propofol for gastrointestinal endoscopy will continue to increase. Structured nurse-administered propofol programs appear to be safe, but the occurrence of severe respiratory depression and the ability to rescue remain concerns. Further study into appropriate sedation training, patient selection, ability to rescue, complications and value of anesthesiologist-directed sedation is necessary.", 
    "171": "Procedural sedation and monitored anesthesia care have become increasingly common in locations outside of the operating room. The different types of procedures are presented along with pertinent safety issues with the use of different drug combinations.",

Monitored anesthesia care was given to 0.4% of patients outside of the operating room. Events associated with monitored anesthesia care have been related to age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, and obesity. Without the use of capnography, significant delays in the detection of apnea were demonstrable. Respiratory compromise with propofol for sedation appears less than that described for sedation using opiates and benzodiazepines.", 
    "173": "The number and types of procedures done outside of the operating room are steadily increasing. Sedation for these is often provided by nonanesthesiologists. A quality assurance system dedicated to track events associated with procedural sedation and anesthesia done outside of the operating room is instrumental for the maintenance of exemplary quality of sedation and safety of our patients.",

For 14 of the 17 quality indicators, there was no significant difference in performance between visits with vs without EHR use. Categories of these indicators included medical management of common diseases, recommended antibiotic prescribing, preventive counseling, screening tests, and avoiding potentially inappropriate medication prescribing in elderly patients. For 2 quality indicators, visits to medical practices using EHRs had significantly better performance: avoiding benzodiazepine use for patients with depression (91% vs 84%; P = .01) and avoiding routine urinalysis during general medical examinations (94% vs 91%; P = .003). For 1 quality indicator, visits to practices using EHRs had significantly worse quality: statin prescribing to patients with hypercholesterolemia (33% vs 47%; P = .01).",

    "178": "This study was designed to study the in vitro metabolism of indiplon, a novel hypnotic agent, and to assess its potential to cause drug interactions. In incubations with pooled human liver microsomes, indiplon was converted to two major, pharmacologically inactive metabolites, N-desmethyl-indiplon and N-desacetyl-indiplon. The N-deacetylation reaction did not require NADPH, and appeared to be catalyzed by organophosphate-sensitive microsomal carboxylesterases. The N-demethylation of indiplon was catalyzed by CYP3A4/5 based on the following observations: (1) the sample-to-sample variation in N-demethylation of indiplon ([S] = 100 microM) in a bank of human liver microsomes was strongly correlated with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase (CYP3A4/5) activity (r(2) = 0.98), but not with any other CYP enzyme; (2) recombinant CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 had the ability to catalyze this reaction; (3) the N-demethylation of indiplon was inhibited by CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (ketoconazole and troleandomycin), but not by a CYP1A2 inhibitor (furafylline). In pooled human liver microsomes, indiplon exhibited a weak capacity to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 and carboxylesterase (p-nitrophenylacetate hydrolysis) activities (IC50 >/= 20 microM). Clinical data available on indiplon support the conclusions of this paper that the in vitro metabolism of indiplon is catalyzed by multiple enzymes, and indiplon is a weak inhibitor of human CYP enzymes.",

Sleep onset latency, as measured by polysomnography, was significantly decreased for benzodiazepines (BDZ), (weighted mean difference: -10.0 minutes; 95% CI: -16.6, -3.4), non-benzodiazepines (non-BDZ) (-12.8 minutes; 95% CI: -16.9, -8.8) and antidepressants (ADP) (-7.0 minutes; 95% CI: -10.7, -3.3). Sleep onset latency assessed by sleep diaries was also improved (BDZ: -19.6 minutes; 95% CI: -23.9, -15.3; non-BDZ: -17.0 minutes; 95% CI: -20.0, -14.0; ADP: -12.2 minutes; 95% CI: -22.3, -2.2). Indirect comparisons between drug categories suggest BDZ and non-BDZ have a similar effect. All drug groups had a statistically significant higher risk of harm compared to placebo (BDZ: risk difference [RD]: 0.15; non-BDZ RD: 0.07; and ADP RD: 0.09), although the most commonly reported adverse events were minor. Indirect comparisons suggest that non-BDZ are safer than BDZ.",

Morphine (M, 10 mg) was administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Arterial blood and CSF samples (from a spinal catheter) were drawn simultaneously at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min after administration. Morphine and metabolites [morphine-3-glucuronide (M-3-G), morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G), and normorphine (NM)] were determined by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.", 
    "187": "Thirty-eight patients were included: 13 men and 25 women, 20 in the IV, 18 in the IM group. Serum concentrations of M after 10 min were consistently higher after IM than IV, concentrations of M-3-G and M-6-G after IM surpassed those of IV after 45 min. NM was not found. None of the metabolites was found in CSF. CSF morphine concentrations and CSF/serum concentration ratios were consistently higher after IV compared to IM. The mean AUC(CSF)/AUC(serum) (0-120 min) concentration ratios were 0.18 and 0.09 after IV and IM, respectively.", 
    "188": "The uptake of morphine to the CSF was consistently higher after IV administration than after IM already after 10 min. The higher CSF concentration may be caused by an initially higher morphine blood/CSF gradient following IV morphine injection. The pharmacokinetic findings are compatible with a more rapid and extensive initial effect of IV morphine compared with IM.",

Of these, 535 were benzodiazepine users, yielding a frequency of use of 30.2% [95% confidence intervals (CI) 28.0, 32.4]. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, lower level of education, diagnosis of affective illness, longer length of illness and higher service use were significantly associated with benzodiazepine exposure. An increase in dosages over time to maintain the drug's effectiveness was not evident from the analysis of the relationship between daily dose and length of therapy. A total of 17.3% (93/535) of patients exposed to benzodiazepines discontinued treatment. Cox regression analysis revealed that age and length of illness were negatively associated with the probability of discontinuing therapy, while the concomitant use of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers was positively associated with discontinuing therapy.", 
    "192": "The finding that in the great majority of psychiatric patients, low doses of benzodiazepines are routinely prescribed on a long-term basis suggests that, in this specific setting of care, treatment recommendations stating that use should be short term may not be applicable."
