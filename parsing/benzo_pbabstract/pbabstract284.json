    "0": "Benzodiazepines are among the most prescribed and consumed medication groups in the world. Although benzodiazepines are used in the treatment of several psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders, and are generally safe and well-tolerated, the potential for misuse and abuse is considerable. This makes the study and regulation of benzodiazepine prescription and consumption an item of concern in public health around the world. Most developed countries have consistent data of benzodiazepine sales and consumption; however, data from developing countries is scarce, making health policies on the use of benzodiazepines a much tougher issue in these countries. This article aims to review the epidemiology of benzodiazepine use in Brazil, as well as to analyze how legislation, physician misinformation and economic factors might contribute to making benzodiazepine abuse a problem in the country.", 
    "1": "(1) In chronic insomnia, cognitive-behaviour treatments appear to be as effective as benzodiazepines.", 
    "2": "(1) Loss of efficacy can occur after a few weeks of treatment with zolpidem and zopiclone. This is not a reason to increase the dose. (2) Zolpidem and zopiclone carry a risk of dependence and of potentially severe disorders (e.g. seizures) during withdrawal. (3) The risk-benefit ratio of benzodiazepines and related drugs (zopiclone and zolpidem) remains more favourable than that of other drugs used in insomnia. However, first-line treatment of sleep disorders should not necessarily be drug-based.", 
    "3": "(1) Olanzapine, a neuroleptic, has obtained European marketing authorisation for the treatment of schizophrenia. (2) The clinical file is satisfactory, but in the absence of relevant trials it has not yet been demonstrated that olanzapine has a specific activity on the positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. (3) The global efficacy of olanzapine was not significantly different from that of haloperidol in two of the three comparative trials published to date. (4) The only relevant comparative trial fails to demonstrate the superiority of olanzapine over risperidone. (5) Olanzapine has fewer adverse neurological effects than haloperidol, but there is no evidence that it differs from other recent neuroleptics in this respect. (6) Olanzapine can have anticholinergic adverse effects and frequently causes weight gain. (7) Active pharmacovigilance is required, as subclinical cases of elevated transaminase levels, increased blood pressure and QT prolongation were observed in clinical trials (2,500 patients treated).", 
    "4": "(1) Three years after high-dose buprenorphine preparations were first marketed in France, we examine their use as replacement therapy for heroin addiction. (2) Various surveys of community pharmacists have shown that the prescribing and dispensing conditions are feasible in the routine ambulatory setting. However, teamwork between physicians and pharmacists is rarely optimal, and fractionated dispensing is under-used. This could lead to abuse by a minority of patients. (3) During ambulatory management, at a mean dose of 8 mg/day sublingually, long-term buprenorphine therapy seems to yield a reduction in drug consumption by most patients, and can help with social reintegration. (4) The risks of buprenorphine treatment are mainly linked to abuse (massive doses, intravenous injection). Fatalities have occurred after high doses of buprenorphine combined with benzodiazepines, especially when taken intravenously. (5) The limited data on buprenorphine intake during pregnancy are reassuring.", 
    "5": "This study evaluated the effect of oral ranitidine (75 mg and 150 mg) on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam (0.25 mg) and its major metabolite, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, in both young and older people. Metabolite data were used to distinguish the mechanism of this interaction.", 
    "6": "This was a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study. Eighteen young (19-60 years) and 12 older (61-78 years) men and women were randomly assigned to receive evening doses of triazolam 0.25 mg (1) alone, (2) on the third day of dosing ranitidine 75 mg twice daily for 4 days, and (3) on the third day of dosing ranitidine 150 mg twice daily for 4 days.", 
    "7": "In the young group, mean triazolam area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] was 10% and 28% higher after treatment with 75 mg and 150 mg ranitidine, respectively. In the older group, mean triazolam AUC(0-infinity) was 31% and 28% higher after treatment with 75 mg and 150 mg ranitidine, respectively. There was no change in the alpha-hydroxytriazolam/triazolam AUC(0-infinity) ratio in either age group, indicating that neither formation nor elimination of alpha-hydroxytriazolam was affected by ranitidine. There were no changes in the half-life of triazolam or alpha-hydroxytriazolam.", 
    "8": "Ranitidine increases oral absorption of triazolam in both young and older people. This effect is likely caused by elevation of gastrointestinal pH, allowing for greater absorption of acid-labile triazolam. The difference in this effect between age groups at the lower 75-mg dose of ranitidine suggests that older people may be more sensitive to the antisecretory effect of ranitidine.", 
    "9": "The stability and compatibility of ceftazidime have been examined in the context of its potential use in concentrated solutions for continuous infusion in patients suffering from severe nosocomial pneumonia and receiving other intravenous medications by the same route. Ceftazidime stability in 4 to 12% solutions was found satisfactory (<10% degradation) for 24 h if kept at a temperature of 25 degrees C (77 degrees F) maximum. Studies mimicking the simultaneous administration of ceftazidime and other drugs as done in clinics showed physical incompatibilities with vancomycin, nicardipine, midazolam, and propofol and a chemical incompatibility with N-acetylcystein. Concentrated solutions (50 mg/ml) of erythromycin or clarithromycin caused the appearance of a precipitate, whereas gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, isepamicin, fluconazole, ketamine, sufentanil, valproic acid, furosemide, uradipil, and a standard amino acid solution were physically and chemically compatible.", 
    "10": "The effects of an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of a non-selective full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, midazolam, and a neuroactive steroid, allopregnanolone, on picrotoxin-induced seizures and striatal dopamine metabolism, were studied in mice. It was found that acute i.c.v. injections of midazolam (ED50=38.25 nmol) and allopregnanolone (ED50=26.34 nmol) blocked picrotoxin-induced seizures to a similar extent. After repeated administration at the ED(85) doses (midazolam-56.6 nmol, allopregnanolone-94.2 nmol; once or twice daily for 5 days) tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant activity of midazolam (ED50=94.14 nmol) and allopregnanolone (ED50=186.70 nmol). Acute i.c.v. injections of midazolam and allopregnanolone (at the ED50 doses established in the model of picrotoxin seizures: 38.25 and 26.34 nmol, respectively), significantly decreased the concentration of dopamine metabolites: 3-methoxytyramine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, as well as the dopamine turnover rate (homovanilic acid/dopamine ratio; by about 20%), in the mouse striatum. These findings together with the recently published data on the potentiation by midazolam and allopregnanolone of ethanol-induced sleep [Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 67 (2000) 345] indicate a very similar central effect profile of benzodiazepines and neurosteroids. Moreover, similar efficacy of allopregnanolone and midazolam at the GABA(A) receptors has been found. Overall, the results of the present study, along with the possibility of neurosteroid conversion in the brain into other steroid hormones (testosterone, estradiol, aldosterone), add to the accumulating evidence suggesting a less favorable pharmacological profile for this class of drugs than was previously thought.", 
    "11": "Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and midazolam are determined by high-perfromance, thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Results are compared with those obtained by liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC). Analytical conditions for all the methods are also described. Validation parameters for linearity, precision, detection, and quantitative limits are informed. Correlation study of HPTLC with LC and GC gave a correlation factor between 0.98 and 0.99. The obtained results showed that HPTLC, LC, and GC techniques are comparable for determination of such benzodiazepins in the requested working range to be analyzed in raw materials.", 
    "12": "The conformational of selected 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine derivatives with high sedative-hypnotic activity was analysed and the model bioactive conformations were suggested. Subsequently, the pharmacophores of analysed compounds were designed. It was suggested that the pharmacophore of bioactive derivatives should be composed of 11 features that characterise the binding model of pyrimidinylpiperazine ligands to the binding site at the hypothetic receptor. This 11 feature pharmacophore was compared to three other pharmacophores designed for the selected anxiolytics (benzodiazepines and buspirone analogues) and the sedative-hypnotic agents (benzodiazepines and barbiturates). Several substantial differences between the pharmacophores were found: the number of pharmacophoric features and their distribution in 3-D space were unique for selected groups of compounds that exhibit sedative-hypnotic or anxiolytic activity.", 
    "13": "Conventional neuroleptics ameliorate symptoms in children with autistic disorder; however, they are known to cause dyskinesias. Atypical neuroleptics, including olanzapine, may have less risk for dyskinesia, but their efficacy in autistic disorder is not established. This study was designed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of open-label olanzapine as a treatment for children with autistic disorder by using haloperidol as a standard comparator treatment.", 
    "14": "In a parallel groups design, 12 children with DSM-IV autistic disorder (mean age 7.8+/-2.1 years) were randomized to 6 weeks of open treatment with olanzapine or haloperidol. Mean final dosages were 7.9+/-2.5 mg/day for olanzapine and 1.4+/-0.7 mg/day for haloperidol. Outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) and the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS).", 
    "15": "Both groups had symptom reduction. Five of six in the olanzapine group and three of six in the haloperidol group were rated as responders according to the CGI Improvement item. Subjects showed improvement on the CPRS Autism Factor (F1,9 = 24.4, p = .0008). Side effects included drowsiness and weight gain.", 
    "16": "The findings suggest that olanzapine is a promising treatment for children with autistic disorder. Further placebo-controlled and long-term studies of olanzapine in autistic disorder are required.", 
    "17": "Behavioral emergencies are a common and serious problem for consumers, their communities, and the healthcare settings on which they rely to contain, assess, and ultimately help the individual in a behavioral crisis. Partly because of the inherent dangers of this situation, there is little research to guide provider responses to this challenge. Key constructs such as agitation have not been adequately operationalized so that the criteria defining a behavioral emergency are vague. The significant progress that has been made for some disease states with better treatments and higher consumer acceptance has not penetrated this area of practice. A significant number of deaths of patients in restraint has focused government and regulators on these issues, but a consensus about key elements in the management of behavioral emergencies has not yet been articulated by the provider community. The authors assembled a panel of 50 experts to define the following elements: the threshold for emergency interventions, the scope of assessment for varying levels of urgency and cooperation, guiding principles in selecting interventions, and appropriate physical and medication strategies at different levels of diagnostic confidence and for a variety of etiologies and complicating conditions.", 
    "18": "In order to identify issues in this area on which there is consensus, a written survey with 808 decision points was developed. The survey was mailed to a panel of 52 experts, 50 of whom completed it. A modified version of the RAND Corporation 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions was used to score options. Consensus on each option was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by chi-square \"goodness-of-fit\" test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/alternate choice, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guideline tables were constructed describing the preferred strategies in key clinical situations.", 
    "19": "The expert panel reached consensus on 83% of the options. The relative appropriateness of emergency interventions was ascertained for a continuum of behaviors. When asked about the frequency with which emergency interventions (parenteral medication, restraints, seclusion) were required in their services, 47% of the experts reported that such interventions were necessary for 1%-5% of patients seen in their services and 32% for 6%-20%. In general, the consensus of this panel lends support to many elements of recent Health Care Financing Administration regulations, including the timing of clinician assessment and reassessment and the intensity of nursing care. However, the panel did not endorse the concept of \"chemical restraint,\" instead favoring the idea that medications are treatments for target behaviors in behavioral emergencies even when the causes of these behaviors are not well understood. Control of aggressive behavior emerged as the highest priority during the emergency; however, preserving the physician-patient relationship was rated a close second and became the top priority in the long term. Oral medications, particularly concentrates, were clearly preferred if it is possible to use them. Benzodiazepines alone were top rated in 6 of 12 situations. High-potency conventional antipsychotics used alone never received higher ratings than benzodiazepines used alone. A combination of a benzodiazepine and an antipsychotic was preferred for patients with suspected schizophrenia, mania, or psychotic depression. There was equal support for high-potency conventional or atypical antipsychotics (particularly liquids) in oral combinations with benzodiazepines. Droperidol emerged in fourth place in some situations requiring an injection.", 
    "20": "To evaluate many of the treatment options in this survey, the experts had to extrapolate beyond controlled data in comparing modalities with each other or in combination. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide some direction for addressing common clinical dilemmas in the management of psychiatric emergencies and can be used to inform clinicians in acute care settings regarding the relative merits of various strategies.", 
    "21": "Clobazam is a newer 1,5-benzodiazepine used for the treatment of epilepsy. It is better tolerated and less sedating than other benzodiazepines. It has yet to gain wide use for epilepsy in the Middle East. Our objective is to report our experience with clobazam for the treatment of childhood epilepsy.", 
    "22": "A cohort of children with intractable epilepsy, defined as recurrent seizures after at least 3 anti-epileptic medication trials, were included prospectively. Clobazam was added to a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Follow-up by two pediatric neurologists was performed. Therapeutic response was recorded as complete (no seizures), good (>50% seizure reduction), fair (<50% seizure reduction), or none.", 
    "23": "Thirty one children (21 males-10 females), aged 2 months-15 years (mean 4.6 years) were followed for 3-12 months. Most children (68%) had daily seizures and were on multiple anti-epileptic drugs (mean 2.3, +/- SD 1). Fourteen (45%) children had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. After the introduction of clobazam, 11 (35.5%) became completely seizure free and 14 (45%) had >50% seizure reduction. Side effects were reported in 7 (22.5%) in the form of excessive sedation, vomiting, irritability, behavioral change, and ataxia. In 4 children these side effects resolved either spontaneously or with dose reduction.", 
    "24": "Clobazam is a well tolerated, safe, and very effective antiepileptic drug. It has a broad spectrum of antiepileptic activity, minimal side effects, and is relatively inexpensive. Wider use of this drug is recommended in children with intractable epilepsy.",

The peripheral blood concentrations of cis(Z)-clopenthixol and trans(E)-clopenthixol were 278 and 177 ng/mL, respectively. The level of the active cis(Z)-isomer is within the toxic range. Other associated drugs' concentrations were within their therapeutic ranges. Postmortem redistribution of the drug and instability of the drug due to trans-isomerization were discussed.", 
    "26": "Among the different 1,4-benzodiazepine urinary metabolites, those of bromazepam possess distinctive chemical features that may be used in their selective isolation and detection. The detection of bromazepam metabolites in urine was carried out using EMIT d.a.u., thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The positive EMIT d.a.u. benzodiazepine assay for bromazepam was found to be due to the 3-hydroxybromazepam (3HOB) metabolite. The detection by TLC and GC-MS was carried out after enzyme or acid hydrolysis of the glucuronide conjugates. Both the 2-amino-3-hydroxy5-bromobenzoylpyridine (AHBBP) metabolite and the acid hydrolysis product of 3-HOB, 2-amino-5-bromobenzoylpyridine (ABBP), were selectively detected by TLC. The bromazepam metabolites in urine could be both isolated and detected selectively by GC-MS in the presence of the metabolites of other 1,4-benzodiazepines that were sometimes used in combination with bromazepam. Both 3-HOB and AHBBP were detected by GC-MS only after trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatization and not as the free compounds or the acetyl derivatives. Only ABBP was detected in three forms: ABBP, the TMS derivative, and the acetyl derivative. Evidence has been obtained from the enzyme hydrolysis and the TLC studies for the formation of the glucuronide conjugate of AHBBP at the 3-OH group rather than at the 2-NH2 group. All the results have been validated using reference 3-HOB and AHBBP.", 
    "27": "An automated method for simultaneous routine quantification of the antipsychotic drugs clozapine, olanzapine and their demethylated metabolites is described. The method included adsorption on a cyanopropyl (CPS) coated clean-up column (10 microm; 10 x 2.0 mm I.D.), washing off interfering serum constituents to waste, and separation on C18 ODS Hypersil reversed phase material (5 microm; 250 x 4.6 mm I.D.) using acetonitrile-water-tetramethylethylenediamine (37:62.6:0.4, v/v/v) adjusted to pH 6.5 with concentrated acetic acid. UV-detection was performed at 254 nm. The limit of quantification was 10-20 ng/ml. Relative day to day standard variations ranged between 4.5 and 13.5%. The method is suitable for routine monitoring of olanzapine and clozapine including their demethylated metabolites.", 
    "28": "Olanzapine is a commonly used atypical antipsychotic medication for which therapeutic drug monitoring has been proposed as clinically useful. A sensitive method was developed for the determination of olanzapine concentrations in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography with low-wavelength ultraviolet absorption detection (214 nm). A single-step liquid-liquid extraction procedure using heptane-iso-amyl alcohol (97.5:2.5 v/v) was employed to recover olanzapine and the internal standard (a 2-ethylated olanzapine derivative) from the biological matrices which were adjusted to pH 10 with 1 M carbonate buffer. Detector response was linear from 1-5000 ng (r2>0.98). The limit of detection of the assay (signal:noise=3:1) and the lower limit of quantitation were 0.75 ng and 1 ng/ml of olanzapine, respectively. Interday variation for olanzapine 50 ng/ml in plasma and urine was 5.2% and 7.1% (n=5), respectively, and 9.5 and 12.3% at 1 ng/ml (n=5). Intraday variation for olanzapine 50 ng/ml in plasma and urine was 8.1% and 9.6% (n=15), respectively, and 14.2 and 17.1% at 1 ng/ml (n=15). The recoveries of olanzapine (50 ng/ml) and the internal standard were 83 +/- 6 and 92 +/- 6% in plasma, respectively, and 79 +/- 7 and 89 +/- 7% in urine, respectively. Accuracy was 96% and 93% at 50 and 1 ng/ml, respectively. The applicability of the assay was demonstrated by determining plasma concentrations of olanzapine in a healthy male volunteer for 48 h following a single oral dose of 5 mg olanzapine. This method is suitable for studying olanzapine disposition in single or multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies.",

Pretreatment with flumazenil (0.3-1.0 mg/kg) antagonized the anticonflict and response rate-decreasing effects of all three agonists. Pretreatment with beta-CCt (3-10 mg/kg) antagonized the anticonflict and rate-decreasing effects of midazolam, as well as the rate-decreasing effects of zolpidem and zaleplon. However, beta-CCt did not antagonize the anticonflict effects of zolpidem and zaleplon; instead, these effects of zolpidem and zaleplon were apparently enhanced in the presence of beta-CCt. Under the schedule of stimulus shock-termination, both flumazenil and beta-CCt antagonized zolpidem and zaleplon; however, the effects of beta-CCt were less consistent than the effects of flumazenil.",

    "39": "1. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that diazepam behaves as a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) inhibitor. It has been reported that PDE-4 inhibitors activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis in the rat. In the present study we have examined whether activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is involved in the effect of diazepam on basal HPA axis activity. 2. Acute systemic administration of diazepam (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) was found to increase the basal HPA axis activity, increasing the plasma concentrations of corticotrophin (ACTH) and corticosterone 30 min post injection. Diazepam also elevated cyclic AMP content of the hypothalamus. 3. Pretreatment of the animals with dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1) s.c.) for 3 days completely abolished the effect of diazepam on HPA axis activity. 4. The antagonists of central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, flumazenil (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and PK 11195 (5 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not affect the diazepam induced increase of HPA axis activity nor did they have an effect per se. 5. The increase in ACTH and corticosterone levels was significantly reduced by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor, H-89, given either subcutaneously (5 mg kg(-1) s.c.) or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.; 28 microg in 10 microl). 6. The results indicate that diazepam can stimulate basal HPA axis activity in the rat by a cyclic AMP-dependent PKA mediated pathway.",

    "46": "After ethical approval, 30 surgical intensive care patients were investigated in an open, controlled design. Patients with initial cardiocirculatory stability received 0.33-1.0 mg/kg BW/h (S)-ketamine together with 1-3 mg/kg BW/h propofol (SK/P-group), whereas patients with impaired cardiocirculatory stability received 0.33-1.0 mg/kg BW/h (S)-ketamine and 0.033-0.1 mg/kg BW/h midazolam (SK/M-group). Analgosedation was titrated until tolerance of respirator treatment was achieved and the patient was asleep, but able to respond to simple commands. At least 12 h after beginning of analgosedation, a simple neurological examination (\"diagnostic window\") was undertaken.", 
    "47": "In both groups, biometric data and diseases were altogether comparable, and tolerance of respirator treatment was excellent. About 16 h after start of analgosedation, 13 of 14 patients (93%) in the SK/P-group were immediately cooperative. In 2 of 16 patients of the SK/M-group, self extubation occurred, and 9 of 14 remaining patients (64%) were immediately cooperative (p = 0.065). Assessment of control and quality of analgosedation indicated slight advantages in SK/P-patients. SEF90 showed predominant beta-activity in both collectives, which increased in the course of time. Adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH and cortisol were measured at 7 time points. All endocrine stress parameters were consistently above normal range, but decreased during the observation period (p < 0.05). In the SK/M-group, ADH was significantly and noradrenaline initially higher than in controls. Systolic arterial pressure was comparable, whereas heart rate was significantly lower in the SK/P-group (p = 0.001). No relevant changes of endocrine or haemodynamic parameters were observed at neurological examination.", 
    "48": "In surgical intensive care patients, analgosedation with SK/P showed some advantages over SK/M with respect to control and quality. The endocrine stress response was reduced by both regimens in course of time. Altogether higher levels of ADH and noradrenaline during SK/M-analgosedation let expect higher cardiocirculatory stability and possible reduction of catecholamine demand. Due to ketamine-typical beta-activity, a reliable assessment of sedation by the pEEG is not possible.", 
    "49": "Noxious stimuli facilitate oxytocin release from the pituitary. Oxytocin cells receive excitatory synaptic inputs from the noradrenergic neurones located in the medulla oblongata. Oxytocin release after noxious stimuli is blocked by noradrenaline depletion in the brain. Here, we examined effects of noxious stimuli upon noradrenaline release within the supraoptic nucleus. Electric footshocks or mustard oil application to the foot pad facilitated noradrenaline release in the nucleus. Noradrenaline release after noxious stimuli was impaired by microinjections with a GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, or an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, into the A1 noradrenergic cell regions. From these and reported data, we conclude that the medullary A1 noradrenergic neurones contribute, at least in part, to oxytocin release from the pituitary after noxious stimuli.", 
    "50": "The success of the M(1)-selective muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine in preventing myopia development in animal models implicates a role for the M(1) receptor. However, the relatively high dose of pirenzepine required may indicate that the drug acts through another receptor subtype. This study examined whether the M(4)-selective antagonist, himbacine, could also prevent myopia. Daily intravitreal injections of himbacine inhibited the inducement of myopia in chick eyes in a dose- dependent manner. Doses < or = 200 microg caused no significant inhibition of induced myopia compared to controls (-13.7 +/- 2.3 vs -16.2 +/- 0.9D, ANOVA p = 0.37), whilst a dose of 800 microg almost completely inhibited the induced myopia (-2.4 +/- 2.0, p < 0.01). Findings demonstrate himbacine is effective at preventing the development of myopia in chick and implicates a role for the M4 receptor.", 
    "51": "Habituation of the behavioral response to a repetitive stimulus is a well-established observation in perceptual studies and is considered a basic form of nonassociative learning. There is also a long history of physiological studies suggesting that central nervous system habituation is mediated by inhibition. At higher levels of the sensory pathways, such inhibition is mainly contributed by GABAa receptor mechanisms. Concepts of modification of synaptic efficacy that apply to excitatory amino acid synaptic transmission do not have direct parallels with these inhibitory synapses: quantal release of GABA rapidly saturates available receptors at a synapse, placing an upper limit on responsiveness to increased transmitter release. However, pharmacological modulation of GABAa-receptor efficacy with exogenous agents (e.g., benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines) is known to occur through allosteric mechanisms that modulate the effectiveness (positive and negative) of GABA at this receptor. The most potent endogenous modulators are 5alpha-reduced steroids. Production of these steroids was attenuated in adult rats with systemic injection of Finasteride, a competitive substrate for 5alpha-reductase. This treatment was sufficient to block habituation of the evoked midbrain response to repetitive presentation of an acoustic click. This result confirms that simple habituation is due to an increase in active inhibition, the increase being mediated by steroid modulation of the GABAa-receptor. Finasteride treatment also brought about a 23% increase in the evoked response to a click stimulus, suggesting that 5alpha-reduced steroids normally contribute to tonic inhibition in the rat inferior colliculus.", 
    "52": "Neurons in the central amygdala express two distinct types of ionotropic GABA receptor. One is the classical GABA(A) receptor that is blocked by low concentrations of bicuculline and positively modulated by benzodiazepines. The other is a novel type of ionotropic GABA receptor that is less sensitive to bicuculline but blocked by the GABA(C) receptor antagonist (1,2,5,6-tetrohydropyridine-4-yl) methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) and by benzodiazepines. In this study, we examine the distribution of these two receptor types. Recordings of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) showed a wide variation in amplitude. Most events had amplitudes of < 50 pA, but a small minority had amplitudes >100 pA. Large-amplitude events also had rise times faster than small-amplitude events. Large-amplitude events were fully blocked by 10 microM bicuculline but unaffected by TPMPA. Small amplitude events were partially blocked by both bicuculline and TPMPA. Focal application of hypertonic sucrose to the soma evoked large-amplitude mIPSCs, whereas focal dendritic application of sucrose evoked small-amplitude mIPSCs. Thus inhibitory synapses on the dendrites of neurons in the central amygdala express both types of GABA receptor, but somatic synapses expressed purely GABA(A) receptors. Minimal stimulation revealed that inhibitory inputs arising from the laterally located intercalated cells innervate dendritic synapses, whereas inhibitory inputs of medial origin innervated somatic inhibitory synapses. These results show that different types of ionotropic GABA receptors are targeted to spatially and functionally distinct synapses. Thus benzodiazepines will have different modulatory effects on different inhibitory pathways in the central amygdala.", 
    "53": "Selective modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(4) subunits may provide new treatments for epilepsy and premenstrual syndrome. Using mouse L(-tk) cells, we stably expressed the native GABA(A) receptor subunit combinations alpha(3)beta(3)gamma(2,) alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2), and, for the first time, alpha(4)beta(3)delta and characterized their properties using a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay of GABA-evoked depolarizations. GABA evoked concentration-dependent decreases in fluorescence resonance energy transfer that were blocked by GABA(A) receptor antagonists and, for alpha(3)beta(3)gamma(2) and alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors, modulated by benzodiazepines with the expected subtype specificity. When combined with alpha(4) and beta(3), delta subunits, compared with gamma(2), conferred greater sensitivity to the agonists GABA, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP), and muscimol and greater maximal efficacy to THIP. alpha(4)beta(3)delta responses were markedly modulated by steroids and anesthetics. Alphaxalone, pentobarbital, and pregnanolone were all 3-7-fold more efficacious at alpha(4)beta(3)delta compared with alpha(4)beta(3)gamma(2.) The fluorescence technique used in this study has proven valuable for extensive characterization of a novel GABA(A) receptor. For GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(4) subunits, our experiments reveal that inclusion of delta instead of gamma(2) subunits can increase the affinity and in some cases the efficacy of agonists and can increase the efficacy of allosteric modulators. Pregnanolone was a particularly efficacious modulator of alpha(4)beta(3)delta receptors, consistent with a central role for this subunit combination in premenstrual syndrome.", 
    "54": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that is diagnosed primarily by the presence of generalized pain along with tenderness on palpation of certain body regions. Unfortunately, the pharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia remains problematic. Two patients are described who highlight the use of the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine for the control of symptoms related to fibromyalgia. Prior to the use of olanzapine, both patients had received a multitude of treatments, none of which greatly improved their ability to function in daily activities. With olanzapine, both patients reported a significant decrease in pain and marked improvement in daily functioning. In one case, the pain returned during a period of time when olanzapine was discontinued, an effect that was reversed when olanzapine was reintroduced. The paucity of serious side effects (i.e., extrapyramidal signs) with the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine strongly favors further exploration and use of this drug for the treatment of fibromyalgia symptoms.", 
    "55": "There is increasing evidence for a direct interaction of the enteric nervous and immune system. Receptors for neuropeptides such as VIP, somatostatin, and substance P have been characterised in human immuno-haematopoietic cells but little is known about the functional significance and expression of receptors for cholecystokinin (CCK) on cells of the immune system. There are only few studies that describe the expression of CCK receptors on human leukaemia-derived cell lines but the receptor structure and function in normal leukocytes have not been clearly established. We therefore sought to determine CCK receptor expression, structure, and function in nontransformed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Full-length cDNA clones encoding the human CCK-A and CCK-B/gastrin receptor are expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers without haematopoietic malignancy. In addition to wild-type CCK-B/gastrin receptor cDNAs, we isolated a splice variant with an in frame insertion of 69 amino acids within its putative third intracellular receptor loop. Dideoxy sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA of this splice variant comprises exons 1-4 but retains intron 4 (207 bp) in the absence of mutations within the splice donor sites. Transient expression of this splice variant in COS-7 cells reveals wild-type affinity for CCK-8, Gastrin-17, and antagonist L-365,260. Affinity for glycine-extended gastrin-17 was not increased when compared to the wild-type CCK-B/gastrin receptor. In vitro, gastrin decreased 3H-thymidine labelling in phytohaemagglutinin-pretreated mononuclear cells at a half-maximally effective concentration of 1.5 nM. We also isolated a cDNA encoding another splice variant of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor with a 158 bp deletion of the entire exon 4 sequence. We conclude that wild-type transcripts of both CCK receptor subtypes and splice variants of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor are expressed in nontransformed human mononuclear cells and that gastrin exhibits antiproliferative effects.",

    "57": "Many persons who have developmental disabilities and challenging behaviors are treated with multiple medications combined with nonpharmacological approaches. However, the comparative effects from pharmacotherapy frequently are not assessed empirically, do not include corollary behavioral measures, and are not evaluated in the long term. The present single-case study incorporated behavioral assessment methodology in an \"open label\" evaluation of anticonvulsant (clonazepam), beta-blocking (propanolol), and antidepressant (sertraline and clomipramine) medications on severe aggression in a child with autism. Clinically significant reductions in aggressive behavior were attained with the administration of clomipramine and the reductive effects from the medication persisted for 1.7 years. In addition, clomipramine was associated with the elimination of crisis intervention procedures that had been required to manage the child's aggression. These findings add to the clinical literature describing effective treatment of serious behavior disorders in persons with developmental disabilities using antidepressant medication.",

    "61": "Markers of identified neuronal populations have previously suggested selective degeneration of projection neurons in Huntington's disease (HD) striatum. Interpretations are, however, limited by effects of compensatory regulation and atrophy. Studies of the vesicular monoamine transporter type-2 (VMAT2) and of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in experimental animals indicate that they are robust markers of presynaptic integrity and are not subject to regulation. We measured dopamine and acetylcholine vesicular transporters to characterize the selectivity of degeneration in HD striatum. Brains were obtained at autopsy from four HD patients and five controls. Autoradiography was used to quantify radioligand binding to VMAT2, VAChT, the dopamine plasmalemmal transporter (DAT), benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites, and D2-type dopamine receptors. The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was determined as an additional marker of cholinergic neurons. Autoradiograms were analyzed by video-assisted densitometry and assessment of atrophy was made from regional structural areas in the coronal projection. Striatal VMAT2, DAT, and VAChT concentrations were unchanged or increased, while D2 and BZ binding and ChAT activity were decreased in HD. After atrophy correction, all striatal binding sites were decreased. However, the decrease in ChAT activity was 3-fold greater than that of VAChT binding. In addition to degeneration of striatal projection neurons, there are losses of extrinsic nigrostriatal projections and of striatal cholinergic interneurons in HD on the basis of vesicular transporter measures. There is also markedly reduced expression of ChAT by surviving cholinergic striatal interneurons.", 
    "62": "Similar to the effects produced by the atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) clozapine and olanzapine, Y-931 [8-fluoro-12-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-6H-[1]benzothieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine maleate, a purported atypical APD] effectively facilitated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced, but not (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-evoked, responses in pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Similar to olanzapine and clozapine, the concentration-response curve of Y-931 in these experiments was biphasic. At present, the mechanisms behind the biphasic modulatory actions of Y-931 and olanzapine on NMDA-induced currents in the mPFC are not clear. In addition to augmenting NMDA responses, Y-931 prevented the phencyclidine (PCP)-induced block of the NMDA responses and increased the amplitudes and durations of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by electrical stimulation of the forceps minor. Overall, our findings suggest that APDs, particularly the atypical ones, share a common property in that they facilitate NMDA receptor-mediated transmission in the mPFC and perhaps other functionally related limbic structures as well, which could be the cellular basis for their ability to alleviate some schizophrenic negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions.", 
    "63": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects and interference of different anaesthetic techniques in rabbits undergoing liver total vascular exclusion using a porto-intracaval shunt. Twenty New Zealand rabbits were divided in three groups: group A receiving diazepam as premedication, ketamine + atropine for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia and undergoing a porto-intracaval shunt operation; group B receiving midazolam as premedication, ketamine + fentanyl + atropine for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia and undergoing a porto-intracaval shunt operation; group C receiving the same drugs as group B but undergoing a simple portal and caval clamping. The following parameters were studied: efficacy of premedication, vital parameters before and after clamping and insertion of the shunt, mean time to clamp and insert the shunt, mean survival time after clamping (group C) or activation of the shunt (groups A and B). Midazolam was significantly better for premedication; there was no statistically significant difference between groups A and B for the vital parameters, for the time necessary to clamp and insert the shunt, for the intraoperative course, and for the mean survival time. The absence of a statistically significant difference between groups could be due to the low number of animals used in the study. There is actually evidence that a correct anaesthesiologic protocol, especially referring to analgesia and fluid management, improves the outcome of operated animals. Surely further studies, possibly conducted on a larger number of animals, are required to evaluate better the results observed and to consider applying these data and this experience to humans.",

All potentially inappropriate prescriptions were verified by a consensus panel consisting of a family physician, a geriatric medicine specialist and a geriatric pharmacist. Follow-up letters to the prescribing physicians were developed that briefly described the concerns with the potentially inappropriate prescriptions and suggested safer alternatives. These letters were sent to the prescribing physicians, accompanied by a brief survey. Patient charts in which a potentially inappropriate prescription had been noted were reviewed for prescription changes two months after the prescribing physicians had received the follow-up letters.",

The most common types of potentially inappropriate prescriptions were anticholinergic drugs to manage antipsychotic side effects (17 cases), tricyclic antidepressants with active metabolites (16 cases), and long-acting benzodiazepines (14 cases). The total number of prescription medications (P<0.001), a history of mental illness (P=0.002) and a high minimum data set (MDS) score for depression (P=0.002) were all highly associated with potentially inappropriate prescribing. Variables that were not correlated with increased rates of potentially inappropriate prescribing included age, sex, code status, a diagnosis of dementia (as documented explicitly in the chart), high MDS scores for delirium or cognitive impairment, the date of the prescribing physician's graduation and the total Charlson comorbidity index score. Potentially inappropriate prescriptions were significantly less common in patients seen by a geriatric medicine specialist (P<0.001). In response to the follow-up letter suggesting safer alternatives, 37.9% of potentially inappropriate prescriptions were changed by the prescribing physician.

We sought to assess international differences in the prescription of sedative and analgesic drugs in western European ICUs by means of a short, self-administered questionnaire. Six hundred and forty-seven intensive care physicians from 16 western European countries replied to the questionnaire. Midazolam was used as a sedative often or always by 63% of respondents and propofol by 35%. There were considerable international variations, with midazolam being preferred over propofol in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Austria. For analgesia, the drugs most commonly used were morphine (33%), fentanyl (33%) and sufentanil (24%). Morphine was preferred over fentanyl and sufentanil in Norway, UK and Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Spain and Portugal. Fentanyl was preferred in France, Germany and Italy. Sufentanil was preferred in Belgium and Luxemburg and in Austria. Multivariate analysis showed that the combination of midazolam with fentanyl was most often used in France; propofol with morphine in Sweden, the UK and Ireland, and Switzerland; midazolam with morphine in Norway; and propofol with sufentanil in Belgium and Luxemburg, Germany and Italy. The use of a sedation scale varied from 72% in the UK and Ireland to 18% in Austria. When used, the most common sedation scale was the Ramsay scale. This study demonstrates substantial international differences in sedative and analgesic practices in western European ICUs.",

Here we report on the in vitro culture of porcine hepatocytes in polystyrene tissue-culture flasks without exogenous matrices showing adequate attachment and viability. Cell proliferation was evidenced by uptake of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, with peaks at Days 2 (19.7 +/- 8.5%), 15 (20.8 +/- 3.3%), and 35 (21.4 +/- 0.3%). Detoxification capacity was assessed by determination of monoethylglycinexylidide, a product of lidocaine metabolism (highest value 156.5 +/- 10.1 ng/ml at Day 4), and by diazepam clearance (maximum clearance 66.2% at Day 6). Diazepam metabolite levels were highest at Day 4 both for temazepam and oxazepam (6.5 +/- 0.1 and 0.10 +/- 0.01, respectively). These results suggest that the need for an exogenous matrix to achieve sustained proliferative activity and differentiated hepatocyte function should not necessarily be considered a sine qua non condition.",

Buspirone (0.5 mg/kg/day p.o.) and diazepam (0.6 mg/kg/day p.o.) did not affect the glucose levels in rabbits even after one month of treatment.

    "71": "1. The novel anti-tumour agent 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is extensively metabolized by glucuronidation and 6-methylhydroxylation, resulting in DMXAA acyl glucuronide (DMXAA-G) and 6-hydroxymethyl-5-methylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (6-OH-MXAA). 2. The major human urinary metabolite of DMXAA was isolated and purified by a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method. The isolated metabolite was hydrolysed to free DMXAA by strong base, and by beta-glucuronidase. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and spectral data indicated the presence of a molecular ion [M + 1]+ at m/z 459, which was consistent with the molecular weight of protonated DMXAA-G. 3. The glucuronide was unstable in buffer at physiological pH, plasma and blood with species variability in half-life. Hydrolysis and intramolecular migration were major degradation pathways. 4. In vitro and in vivo formation of DMXAA-protein adducts was observed. The formation of DMXAA-protein adducts in cancer patients receiving DMXAA was significantly correlated with plasma DMXAA-G concentration and maximum plasma DMXAA concentration. 5. At least five metabolites of DMXAA were observed in patient urine, with up to 60% of the total dose excreted as DMXAA-G, 5.5% as 6-OH-MXAA and 4.5% as the glucuronide of 6-OH-MXAA. 6. These data suggest that the major metabolite in patients' urine is DMXAA beta-1-glucuronide, which may undergo hydrolysis, molecular rearrangement and covalent binding to plasma protein. The reactive properties of DMXAA-G may have important implications for the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity of DMXAA.",

The effects of several CYP3A substrates (alpha-naphthoflavone (alphaNF), terfenadine, midazolam, erythromycin) on nifedipine oxidation and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation activities were investigated in hepatic and intestinal microsomes from mouse and human. 2. alphaNF (10 microM) and terfenadine (100 microM) inhibited nifedipine oxidation activities (at substrate concentration of 100 microM) in mouse hepatic microsomes to approximately 50%, but not in mouse intestinal microsomes. alphaNF (30 microM) stimulated nifedipine oxidation activities in mouse and human intestinal microsomes and in human hepatic microsomes to approximately 1.3-1.8-fold. Inhibitory potencies (50% inhibition concentration, IC50) of midazolam and erythromycin for nifedipine oxidations were calculated to be approximately 90 microM in human intestinal microsomes. In contrast, testosterone (100 microM) stimulated the nifedipine oxidation activities approximately 1.5-fold in hepatic and intestinal microsomes from mouse and human. 3. alphaNF showed different effects on the kinetic parameters including the Hill coefficients of nifedipine oxidation and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation catalysed by hepatic and intestinal microsomes from mouse and human. Cooperativity in nifedipine oxidation was increased by the addition of alphaNF to pooled human hepatic microsomes, but little effects of alphaNF could be observed in individual human intestinal microsomes. 4. These results suggest that CYP3A enzymes in liver and intestine might have different characteristics and that observations from hepatic microsomes should not be directly applicable to intestine metabolism in some cases.

It was found recently that in rabbit liver microsomes MDEA was biotransformed to n-3-hydroxybutyl-MDEA (3OH-MDEA). 2. In liver microsomes isolated from the untreated rabbit, the formation of 3OH-MDEA obeyed Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics with Km = 6.39 +/- 1.07 microM and Vmax = 0.56 +/- 0.21 nmolmin(-1) mg(-1) protein. 3. Furthermore, (1) among chemicals usually used as inhibitors of cytochrome P450, only midazolam (MDZ), cyclosporin A and ketoconazole inhibited the MDEA hydroxylase activity significantly (>60% inhibition), (2) MDZ, a substrate of CYP3A, inhibited the 30OH-MDEA formation competitively (Ki = 10 +/- 5 microM), (3) the formation rates of 3OH-MDEA correlated positively with those of 1'OH-MDZ (r = 0.81; n = 6), and (4) MDEA hydroxylase activity of microsomes isolated from rabbit rifampicin-induced cultured hepatocytes was 4-fold more active than the control. 4. Since CYP3A6 is mainly induced by rifampicin in rabbit-cultured hepatocytes, the data suggest that this isoform is involved in the biotransformation of MDEA to 3OH-MDEA. 5. Since alpha-naphthoflavone, cimetidine and quinidine also partially inhibited the MDEA hydroxylase activity, it is possible that other CYPs, such as 1A, 2C and 2D, may also be active in the metabolism of amiodarone.",

The prevalence of disturbed sleep in Parkinson's Disease (PD) was found to vary according to an objective rating, from 60 to 98%. The factors predicting the quality of life in PD patients are: depression, sleep disturbances and dependence. The present article proposes the insertion of the following items as a chapter in a revised UPDRS based on updated knowledge in sleep arousal disturbances in PD. V. SLEEP-AROUSAL DISTURBANCES: Sleep disturbances 43. Light fragment sleep (LFS) 44. Sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) 45. Restless legs-periodic leg movements during sleep (RLS-PLM) 46. REM behavioral disorders (RBD) 47. Sleep-related hallucinations (SRH) 48. Sleep-related psychotic behavior (SRPB) Arousal disturbances 49. Sleep attacks (SA) 50. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Approaching the treatment of disturbed sleep in LPD means postponement of the institutionalization of the LPD patient, allowing the spouse or the caregiver a quiet nights sleep. This approach consists of three steps, each one of major importance. (1) Correct diagnosis based on detailed anamnesis of the patient, of the spouse or of the caregiver; a one week recording on a symptom diary (log) by the patient or the caregiver; excluding co morbidities. Then choosing the most appropriate sleep test, if necessary: polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), multiple wake latency test (MWLT), actigraphy or video-PSG. This first step allows the diagnosis of one of the above mentioned sleep-arousal disturbances. (2) The non-specific therapeutic approach consists of: (a) checking the sleep effect on motor performance: beneficial, worse or neutral. (b) Dopaminergic adjustment is necessary due to the progression of the nigrostriatal degeneration and the increased sensitivity of the terminals which alter the normal modulator mechanisms of motor centers in LPD patients. Among the many neurotransmitters of the nigro-striatal pathway one can distinguish two with a major influence on REM and non-REM sleep. REM sleep corresponds to an increased cholinergic receptor activity and a decreased dopaminergic activity. This is the reason why REM sleep deprivation by suppressing cholinergic receptor activity ameliorates LPD motor symptoms. L-Dopa and its agonists by suppressing cholinergic receptors suppress REM sleep. L-Dopa has also an arousal effect on Non-REM sleep, repeatedly awakening the patient and enhancing the fragmentation due to the involuntary movements. (c) Socio-physical assistance. (3) The specific therapy consists of: LFS-Sinemet CR, Tolcapone, Intranasal Desmopressin, Domperidon, Cisapride and neurosurgery; SRBD-CPAP, UPPP, nasal interventions, losing weight; RLS-PLM-Benzodiazepine (Clonazepam), Opioid, Apomorphine infusion; RBD-Clonazepam and dopaminergic agonists; SRH-Clozapine, Risperidone; SRPD-Nortriptyline, Clozapine, Olanzepine; SA-adjustment; EDS-arousing drugs. Each therapeutic approach must be tailored to the individual LPD patient.", 
    "81": "Parkinsonism and dystonia may coexist in a number of neurodegenerative, genetic, toxic, and metabolic disorders and as a result of structural lesions in the basal ganglia. Parkinson's disease (PD) and the 'Parkinson-plus' syndromes (PPS) account for the majority of patients with the parkinsonism-dystonia combination. Dystonia, particularly when it involves the foot, may be the presenting sign of PD or PPS and these disorders should be suspected when adults present with isolated foot dystonia. Young age, female gender, and long disease duration are risk factors for PD-related dystonia, but dystonia in patients with PD is usually related to levodopa therapy. The mechanism of dystonia in PD is not well understood and the management is often challenging because levodopa and other dopaminergic agents may either improve or worsen dystonia. Other therapeutic strategies include oral medications (baclofen, anticholinergics and benzodiazepines), local injections of botulinum toxin, intrathecal baclofen, and surgical lesions or high frequency stimulation of the thalamus, globus pallidus, or subthalamus.", 
    "82": "Certain antidepressant drugs exert an anxiolytic action in both humans and rodents. The effects of long-term treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine, two antidepressant drugs with different mechanisms of action, on the response of cortical cholinergic neurons to foot-shock stress or to the anxiogenic drug FG 7142 were investigated in freely moving rats. Chronic treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine reduced the increase in cortical acetylcholine output induced by foot-shock stress by approximately 50%. The same treatment also reduced the sensitivity of cortical cholinergic neurons to the stimulatory effect of acute administration of FG 7142. In contrast, the administration of a single dose of either antidepressant 40 min before foot shock or FG 7142 injection failed to increase the threshold of excitability of cortical cholinergic neurons. These results demonstrate that long-term treatment with either imipramine or mirtazapine reduces the sensitivity of cortical cholinergic neurons to stress or to an anxiogenic drug with an efficacy similar to that of acute administration of benzodiazepines. The neurochemical mechanism responsible for regulation of cholinergic neuron sensitivity might contribute to the modulation of cognitive function associated with emotional and affective disorders.",

In in vitro functional studies, SB-243213 acted as an inverse agonist at the human 5-HT2C receptor with a pK(b) of 9.8. In in vivo studies, SB-243213 was a potent inhibitor of central 5-HT2C receptor-mediated function in rats, blocking meta-chlorophenylpiperazine-induced hypolocomotion with an ID50 of 1.1 mg/kg p.o. and a long duration of action (>8 h). In rats, SB-243213 exhibited anxiolytic-like activity in both the social interaction and Geller-Seifter conflict tests. Importantly, unlike diazepam, chronic administration of SB-243213 did not result in the development of either tolerance to the anxiolytic-like effects or withdrawal anxiogenesis. Furthermore, in rodents, SB-243213 did not affect seizure threshold, did not increase body weight or induce catalepsy, but attenuated the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. SB-243213 did not affect amphetamine-, MK-801- or phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity. In conclusion, SB-243213 may possess an improved anxiolytic profile compared to benzodiazepines. SB-243213 also modulates dopaminergic transmission, lacks pro-psychotic properties and may have utility in the treatment of schizophrenia and motor disorders.",

The ED(50) values of GYKI 52466 for suppression of the tonic and clonic phases of sound-induced seizures were 3.6 and 4.3 mg/kg, respectively. The corresponding data for GYKI 53405 were 1.1 and 3.1 mg/kg, while ED(50) values of GYKI 53655 were 1.3 and 2.0 mg/kg, respectively. The inhibition of seizure evoked by maximal electroshock was also found to be remarkable: the ED(50) values of GYKI 52466 and its two analogues were 6.9, 2.6, and 2.2 mg/kg, respectively. All compounds prolonged the survival times in MgCl2 induced global cerebral ischaemia test in a dose-dependent fashion, with PD(50) (dose of 50% prolongation) values of 24.1, 8.3, and 8.2 mg/kg intraperitoneal, respectively. In audiogenic seizure model the duration of anticonvulsant action of 10 mg/kg GYKI 52466 and 5 mg/kg GYKI 53405, GYKI 53655 were examined, too. The effect of GYKI 52466 decreased to 50% after 2 h, while the analogues showed more than 80% seizure suppression 3 h after treatment. After 6 h the effect of GYKI 53655 decreased to zero, while the effect of GYKI 52466, remained on the 50% level.", 
    "85": "This work was aimed at evaluating the effects of gamma irradiation on the stability of microspheres made of a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) and loaded with 15% w/w of clonazepam (CLO). The influence of CLO on PLGA radiolysis mechanisms and the identification of possible irradiation markers were also investigated. Microspheres were prepared by means of a spray-drying method. gamma Irradiation was carried out either under vacuum or in air, at a dose of 25 kGy, by using a 60Co source. The stability of CLO loaded microspheres was evaluated over a 6-month period on the basis of drug content and dissolution profile. Radiolysis mechanisms were investigated by using electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. The microspheres irradiated under vacuum were stable over the considered period of time. After irradiation in air, CLO release rate increased by approximately 10%, and did not change further in the following period of storage. The EPR analysis showed some radicals arising from both the polymeric matrix and the active ingredient. Polymer/CLO spin transfer reactions suggest that CLO had a radio-stabilising effect on the polymeric matrix. In the loaded microspheres, the intensity in time of the CLO radical signal is sufficient for its possible use as irradiation marker.", 
    "86": "Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated that withdrawal from the neuroactive steroid 3alpha,5alpha-THP (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) after 3-week exposure to its parent compound, progesterone (P), increases anxiety and produces benzodiazepine (BDZ) insensitivity in female rats. These events were linked to upregulation of the alpha4 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) in the hippocampus [Brain Res. 507 (1998) 91; Nature 392 (1998) 926; J. Neurosci. 18 (1998) 5275]. The present study investigates the role of shorter term hormone treatment on alpha4 subunit levels as well as relevant behavioral and pharmacological end-points related to GABAR function. After 2-3 days of P exposure, two- to threefold increases in alpha4 protein levels were observed, which declined to control values after 5-6 days of hormone exposure. This effect was due to the GABA-modulatory metabolite of P, 3alpha,5alpha-THP. alpha4 upregulation was inversely correlated with BDZ potentiation of GABA-gated current, assessed using whole cell patch clamp techniques on acutely isolated hippocampal pyramidal cells. A near total BDZ insensitivity was observed by 2-3 days of hormone exposure in association with the maximal increase in alpha4 levels. Up-regulation of the alpha4 GABAR subunit was also reflected by an increase in anxiety in the elevated plus maze. A significant decrease in open arm entries was observed after 72-h exposure to P, an effect which recovered by 6 days of P treatment. As demonstrated in vitro, alpha4 upregulation also resulted in a relative insensitivity to the anxiolytic actions of BDZ. These results suggest that short-term exposure to 3alpha,5alpha-THP produces changes in GABAR subunit composition similar to those that occur after chronic exposure and withdrawal from the steroid.", 
    "87": "This retrospective study includes 139 infants (74 girls and 65 boys) treated for status epilepticus at two University hospitals in Tunisia between 1990 and 1997. Their mean age was 11 months. The majority of seizures were generalized (74%) and lasted between 30 minutes and 1 hour (70%). The cause of status epilepticus was classified as acute symptomatic in 56, febrile in 57, remote symptomatic in nine, progressive neurologic in 10 and idiopathic in seven. Overall mortality was 15.8% and neurological sequelae were identified in 36% of the cases during the mean follow-up time of 3.5 years. The incidence of significant sequelae was a function of aetiology (especially acute symptomatic causes) and age (under 1 year of age). We conclude that the most frequent causes of infantile status epilepticus in Tunisia were fever and acute symptomatic causes. Status epilepticus among infants is an important public health problem, with significant associated mortality and morbidity. Management of status epilepticus can be improved by more rapid access to appropriate medical care.", 
    "88": "A sensitive method using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been developed for simultaneous determination of triazolam and its hydroxy metabolites in hair. After the addition of deuterium-labeled 1-hydroxymethyltriazolam as an internal standard, the analytes in hair shaft and hair root samples were extracted with a basic medium, CH(2)Cl(2):MeOH:28% NH(4)OH (20:80:2) at room temperature overnight. The chromatographic separation of the analytes was achieved using a semimicro HPLC column (3-microm particle size; 100 x 2.0-mm i.d.) by gradient elution with acetonitrile in water containing 1% acetic acid as eluent. The mass spectrometer was operated in selected-ion monitoring mode at quasi-molecular ions [M+H](+) of triazolam and its metabolites. The method has been applied to determine the incorporation of triazolam and its metabolites into the hair shafts and hair roots of Dark Agouti rats administered 3 or 6 mg/kg triazolam intraperitoneally twice a day for 5 days. Triazolam, 1-hydroxymethyltriazolam, and 4-hydroxytriazolam were incorporated into the hair shafts and the hair roots. The concentration of 4-hydroxytriazolam was the highest of all compounds detected. An unknown substance considered to be 1,4-dihydroxytriazolam also appeared in the hair samples. The structural elucidation was performed with online HPLC-MS after acetylation of the substance with acetic anhydride and pyridine. The time course studies of triazolam and the metabolites in both rat hair roots and plasma were carried out after single intraperitoneal administration of triazolam. The concentrations of triazolam and the metabolites in the hair roots reflected those in the plasma. The proposed method using selected-reaction monitoring was applied to the determination of triazolam and the metabolites in human hairs of a triazolam addict. Triazolam, 1-hydroxymethyltriazolam, and 4-hydroxytriazolam were identified in the black hair shafts, whereas only triazolam was detected in the hair roots and the white hair shafts. This is the first report on the detection of triazolam and its metabolites in human hairs.",

A group of schizophrenic patients served as a control group (N = 50). Baseline measures, including age, gender, number of hospitalizations in the 2 years prior to olanzapine treatment, concomitant medications, the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and the Global Assessment of Functioning-Equivalent (GAF-EQ) and Kennedy Axis V psychological impairment, violence, social skills, and activities of daily living subscale scores, were obtained. Follow-up information was obtained from the patients at least 6 months after initiation of olanzapine or by chart review and discussion with the treating psychiatrist. Patients with a diagnosis of psychotic mood disorders were compared with patients with the non-affective psychotic disorder (schizophrenia) on a variety of outcome measures.",

Mean follow-up was 15 months; 50 (49%) of the 102 patients remained on olanzapine treatment at follow-up (32 psychotic mood disorder, 18 schizophrenic). The primary reason for discontinuation in both groups was lack of response. Both the psychotic mood disorder and schizophrenic groups had comparable outcomes on the CGI and GAF-EQ. Improvement on the Kennedy Axis V psychological impairment and social skills subscales was seen only in the psychotic mood disorders group (p < .01); both groups showed significant (p < .02) improvement in the violence subscale. Sustained mood-stabilizing effect was evident in only 7/27 (26%) of the psychotic mood disorders patients continuing on add-on olanzapine treatment at follow-up.", 
    "92": "Lack of response was the primary reason for discontinuation of add-on olanzapine in both groups. Mood symptoms predicted a better response to add-on olanzapine in patients with psychotic mood disorders on selective outcome measures.

    "93": "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a common and serious psychiatric illness. Psychopathological symptoms often are heterogenous and difficult to influence. Psychotherapy stands in the core of treatment efforts. However, during the treatment of these patients often situations occur that make the use of drug treatment necessary. Symptoms such as depression, impulsivity, or dissociation can be difficult to deal with in this population. There appears to be no treatment of choice for the disorder as a whole. Reviews so far have organized the literature by groups of pharmacological agents. In this review we give an overview over psychopathological symptoms in BPD, i.e. depression, affective dysregulation, aggression, impulsivity, dissociation, self-injuries, suicidality, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, obsessions and compulsions, and sleep disturbance. Effectivity of different drugs in influencing these symptoms is presented and significances of findings are used to assess the relevance of these findings. We conclude that certain symptoms such as depression or impulsivity can be successfully treated. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors play a decisive role in pharmacological treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. Finally, recommendations for effective drug treatment of BPD symptoms are presented. Comorbid depression should be treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. These substances could also be shown to be effective in the treatment of impulsive and aggressive behavior. Intermittent psychotic symptoms are a target for atypical neuroleptics. Benzodiazepines are no longer viewed to be useful in the treatment of BPD.",

The first group was induced with midazolam (0.15-0.20 mg/kg) while the second was induced with propofol (2-2.5 mg/kg) intravenously. In all other respects except for the surgery that patients had the same treatment. The mean induction time was 55.25 + 26.66 and 69.75 + 24.72 for propofol and midazolam groups respectively. In the midazolam group apnoea occurred in 10% of patients compared to 80% of patients in the propofol group. Local reaction (phlebitis) was absent in the midazolam compared with 20% incident rate observed in the midazolam group. Propofol lowered blood pressure more than midazolam after three minutes of induction at a statistically significant level (P < 0.05). Recovery was significantly more rapid following propofol (P < 0.05).",

Although the term orthostatic tremor was first used by Heilman in 1984, Pazzaglia et al had previously described some cases in 1970. Despite the fact that the pathophysiology of this entity is not fully known, the presence of a central oscillator is generally accepted as being responsible. A high frecuency tremor, between 13 and 18 Hz, constitutes an almost patognomonic finding, and treatment with clonazepam usually improves the symptoms.",

    "100": "A 52-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with burning mouth symptoms. The patient was previously maintained on alprazolam therapy for anxiety, but was switched to clonazepam because of increased anxiety and panic. Clonazepam significantly relieved her symptoms, but after four weeks of therapy, she reported a constant, mild, oral burning sensation. An oral examination was negative for mucosal abnormalities, and laboratory tests were unremarkable. The clonazepam dose was reduced, and the symptoms decreased, but remained intolerable. Clonazepam was discontinued, and the burning mouth symptoms completely resolved. Since no other medications relieved the anxiety and panic symptoms, the patient requested clonazepam to be reinitiated, but she again developed intolerable burning mouth symptoms. As clonazepam was discontinued, the symptoms resolved.", 
    "101": "The clinical presentation of BMS includes burning and painful sensations of the mouth in the absence of mucosal abnormalities. Candidiasis, anemia, menopause, diabetes mellitus, medications, anxiety, and depression are some causes of this syndrome. Paradoxically, clonazepam has been studied for the treatment of BMS and has demonstrated mild to moderate improvement. In this patient, underlying causes of BMS were eliminated when possible. The association between clonazepam and BMS was highly probable according to the Naranjo probability scale.",

    "103": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate among 5 mg/kg pentobarbital, 10mg/kg pentobarbital, and saline, under either fixed-interval (FI) or fixed-ratio (FR) reinforcement schedules. When baseline responding stabilized, a higher percentage of responses occurred on the key that produced the reinforcer under the FR schedule than under the FI schedule. After low doses of pentobarbital, responding shifted from the saline key to the 5 mg/kg pentobarbital key; at higher doses of pentobarbital responding shifted to the 10mg/kg pentobarbital key under both schedules. After low doses of ethanol and chlordiazepoxide, responding shifted from the saline key to the 5 mg/kg pentobarbital key, but after high doses of these drugs, responding continued to occur on the 5 mg/kg pentobarbital key under both reinforcement schedules. A 5 mg/kg dose of pentobarbital increased responding on the 10 mg/kg pentobarbital key when it was combined with pentobarbital, ethanol or chlordiazepoxide. Phencyclidine and D-amphetamine produced responding largely on the saline key under both reinforcement schedules. Under the FR schedule, pentobarbital dose-response curves were usually quantal, whereas under the FI schedule the pentobarbital dose-response curves usually were graded.", 
    "104": "Although selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in the chronic treatment of several anxiety disorders, increased anxiety has been observed in some patients at the beginning of treatment with these compounds. Similar increases in anxiety-related behaviors have been observed in animal studies following a single injection with SSRIs. The mechanism underlying this effect is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a variety of psychoactive compounds on the anxiogenic-like activity of fluoxetine. The drugs used included the benzodiazepine diazepam, the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist buspirone, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists pindolol and WAY-100635, the non-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonists methiothepin, mianserin and ritanserin, the non-selective dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist haloperidol, the D1 antagonist SCH23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride, the D2/3 agonist quinelorane, the cholecystokininB (CCK(B)) receptor antagonist LY 288513, and the corticotropin-releasing factor1 (CRF1) receptor antagonist CP-154,526. Experiments were performed in the free-exploration test. This model is based on the strong neophobic reactions exhibited by BALB/c mice when confronted simultaneously with a familiar and a novel environment. When administered alone, diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg), buspirone (1 mg/kg) and mianserin (0.3 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects as they significantly increased exploratory activity of the novel compartment. In contrast, fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) almost completely suppressed exploration of the novel area. Diazepam reversed the anxiogenic-like as well as the locomotor impairment induced by fluoxetine, while quinelorane blocked only the anxiogenic action of fluoxetine. None of the other compounds was able to counteract this effect. Taken together, these results suggest that dopaminergic mechanisms may underlie, at least in part, the behavioral effects of fluoxetine in the free-exploration test, whereas 5-HT1A 5-HT2, CCK(B) and CRF1 receptors may not be involved primarily in these effects.", 
    "105": "The effects of 7-bromo-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (phenazepam, PNZ), a 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative, and its physiological metabolites on GABA-activated whole-cell currents were studied in enzymatically isolated rat Purkinje neurones. PNZ, its hydroxylated metabolite (HPNZ) and a reference benzodiazepine, diazepam, potently enhanced (up to 200% of control) peak amplitude of currents activated by 10 microM GABA with EC50s of 6.1 +/- 0.8, 10.3 +/- 1.4 and 13.5 +/- 1.9 nM respectively. Both PNZ and HPNZ caused a parallel leftwards shift of the concentration/effect relationship for GABA. Another metabolite, 6-bromo-(2-chlorophenyl) quinazoline-2-one (QNZ), augmented responses to 10 microM GABA with a maximal efficacy similar to that of the 1,4benzodiazepines tested, although its EC50 was 2.4 +/- 0.2 microM. A further metabolite, 5-bromo-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-aminobenzophenone (ABPH), had only minimal effects on the responses elicited by 10 microM GABA. Incubation with QNZ and ABPH had biphasic effects on the concentration/effect relationship for GABA. These compounds enhanced peak amplitudes of currents activated by low concentrations of GABA, but inhibited responses to saturating concentrations of the agonist. This effect could, in part, be explained by the acceleration of the desensitisation process by those substances. It is concluded that both PNZ and HPNZ can be referred to as full positive modulators of GABAA receptors and that they are primarily responsible for GABAergic effects of therapeutic doses of PNZ.", 
    "106": "Treatment strategies for discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine usage can be divided into minimal interventions and gradual discontinuation programs. Minimal interventions invite patients to quit their long-term benzodiazepine usage on their own by making them aware of the adverse effects. This type of intervention is successful in about one fifth of patients. Gradual discontinuation programs are more extensive interventions in order to help those patients who are unable to discontinue benzodiazepine use on their own. These programs are successful in two-thirds of the patients and can be combined with additional pharmacological or psychological treatment. Once the withdrawal symptoms have diminished, most patients have an improved psychological functioning compared to when they were using benzodiazepines. Furthermore, no increase in medical consumption has been found.",

Long-term use may lead to dependency and is associated with an increased risk of accidents/falls and cognitive function impairment. Therefore national and international guidelines advocate a conservative prescription policy, especially with respect to long-term prescription. It appears that these guidelines are not followed in practice. A standard sized general practice in the Netherlands contains, on average, 75 long-term benzodiazepine users. There appear to be both patient and GP related factors which influence the maintenance of this long-term use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "108": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the duration of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) on subsequent cognitive function in rats. SE was induced by pilocarpine (320 mg/kg i.p.) and was terminated by injection of 1 mg/kg diazepam at 30, 60 and 90 min in 3 groups of 10 rats each. Cognitive function was tested by a passive avoidance task and was assessed at the baseline and on days 1, 7, 14 and 21 (post SE). It was found that cognitive function was disrupted on days 7, 14 and 21 post SE in rats who had SE for 60 and 90 min, whereas it was not affected in rats that had 30 min of SE. Hence, the duration of SE may affect future cognitive performance and mandates emergency treatment.",

Regional NMDA subtype glutamate, muscarinic acetylcholine and GABA(A) receptor binding in various brain regions was analysed by quantitative in vitro autoradiography and short-lived positron emission tomography tracers [11C]cyano-dizocilpine, 4-N-[11C]methylpiperidylbenzilate (4-N-[11C]MPB), and [11C]flumazenil, respectively. The binding potential (BP, Bmax/KD) was calculated. The data with [11C]cyano-dizocilpine showed a significant decrease in BP bilaterally for the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus at both time points, in comparison with that of the sham-operated controls. At 12 h the decrease was significantly more prominent for the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus than for the contralateral side. The BP of 4-N-[11C]MPB was significantly decreased after 2 h for the trauma-side hippocampus, and after 12 h it had decreased for the trauma-site cortex and the bilateral hippocampus. The [11C]flumazenil exhibited a significant decrease in BP for the trauma-site cortex and the underlying hippocampus by 2 h after the traumatic brain injury. After 12 h a significantly decreased BP was observed only for the trauma-site cortex. The finding of a decreased BP demonstrates the involvement of these receptor systems in the development of cellular dysfunction, which is widespread and not limited to the site of lateral FPI.", 
    "110": "Involuntary movements may be a symptom in most infants who present with neurologic syndrome of infantile cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. In this report, two infants with cobalamin deficiency are presented. These patients also developed a striking movement disorder that appeared a few days after treatment with intramuscular cobalamin. The movement disorder was characterized by severe involuntary movements, which were a combination of tremor and myoclonus particularly involving tongue, face, pharynx, and legs. The neurologic symptoms improved within a few days after the administration of clonazepam. In each patient the mother was also cobalamin deficient and the infant was solely breast-fed. The cause of involuntary movements that can appear rarely after treatment in infantile cobalamin deficiency is not known. Besides initial neurologic presenting symptoms of cobalamin deficiency, the occurrence of involuntary movements after treatment should also receive attention. This movement disorder may disappear spontaneously, or an additional treatment may be an alternative approach if the symptoms are severe.", 
    "111": "Activity-guided fractionation of methanol-chloroform (1:1) extract of Ferula gummosa was carried out to investigate the isolation of the active component(s) responsible for the alleviation of morphine withdrawal syndrome induced by naloxone. Dependence was induced using subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine daily for three days. On day 4, morphine was injected 0.5 h before the interaperitoneal (i.p.) injections of fractions or diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) as positive control. Naloxone was injected (5 mg/kg, s.c.) 2 h after the final dose of morphine. The number of episodes of jumping during 30 min after the injection of naloxone was considered as the intensity of the withdrawal syndrome. The methanol-chloroform (1:1) extract of the aerial parts of plant was prepared and partitioned between water and chloroform. The active chloroform layer was concentrated and partitioned between methanol-water (9:1) and n-hexane. Activity was observed in the hydroalcoholic layer. This layer was concentrated and partitioned further between methanol-water (3:2) and chloroform. The chloroform layer showed a dose-dependent and significant activity. For all fractions the activity was observed at 470 mg/kg. Further purification on silica gel column chromatography gave a pure compound, which was 10 times as effective as the crude extract. The results of this study indicated that the plant extract contained component(s) that could be useful for the alleviation of morphine withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "112": "As an approach to understanding the role of the alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, ribozymes were designed to reduce expression of this subunit protein by hydrolysis of alpha1 subunit message and antisense inactivation. The ribozyme cleavage sites were selected through homology comparison of all known murine GABA(A) receptor subunits at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence level. Two ribozymes were designed and synthesized: one against the extracellular domain and the other against the cytoplasmic domain. These ribozymes were cloned in a mammalian expression plasmid, pZeoSV2 (+). Cleavage of both extracellular and cytoplasmic domain transcripts by the respective ribozymes was observed when each ribozyme was tested against in vitro transcribed mRNA. The stable cell line, 122, expressing recombinant human GABA(A) alpha1, beta2 and gamma2S subunits of receptor was stably transfected with the cytoplasmic domain ribozyme (cy) alone and with both the cytoplasmic (cy) and extracellular domain (ex) ribozyme expression plasmids. Northern analysis showed a 55-60% reduction of alpha1 mRNA in clones of cells transfected with either the single ribozyme (Cy) or with both ribozymes (EC). The alpha1 protein level was reduced 75% in a stable Cy clone and more than 90% in a stable EC clone when compared with alpha1 expression in 122 cells and the vector transfected (Zeo) cells. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that the GABA(A) receptor properties were very similar in 122 cells and in stable clones in which the subunit protein expression had been greatly reduced. No significant difference was detected in the potentiation of the receptor response by either bretazenil or zolpidem. These data demonstrate the efficacy of the ribozyme approach in dramatically reducing GABA(A) subunit protein levels in transfected cells and identify those elements that will be important to the application of similar ribozymes to knock-down transmitter receptor subunit proteins under inducible promoters in transgenic mice.", 
    "113": "The effects of long-term exposure to, and subsequent withdrawal of, diazepam or imidazenil (full and partial agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor, respectively) on the abundance of GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs and peptides were investigated in rat cerebellar granule cells in culture. Exposure of cells to 10 microM diazepam for 5 days significantly reduced the amounts of alpha(1) and gamma(2) subunit mRNAs, and had no effect on the amount of alpha(4) mRNA. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in the levels of alpha(1) and gamma(2) protein and by a reduction in the efficacy of diazepam with regard to potentiation of GABA-evoked Cl- current. Similar long-term treatment with 10 microM imidazenil significantly reduced the abundance of only the gamma(2)S subunit mRNA and had no effect on GABA(A) receptor function. Withdrawal of diazepam or imidazenil induced a marked increase in the amount of alpha(4) mRNA; withdrawal of imidazenil also reduced the amounts of alpha(1) and gamma(2) mRNAs. In addition, withdrawal of diazepam or imidazenil was associated with a reduced ability of diazepam to potentiate GABA action. These data give new insights into the different molecular events related to GABA(A) receptor gene expression and function produced by chronic treatment and withdrawal of benzodiazepines with full or partial agonist properties.",

This coupling reaction can be used to prepare enantiopure N-aryl beta-amino acids. An efficient synthetic route to SB214857, a potent GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, is developed using this method.", 
    "115": "Foetal and neonatal brain is under the influence of environmental factors from maternal and extra-maternal origin. Based on the available data, these environmental factors can be classified into three arbitrary groups: (i) factors and maternal status with a demonstrated deleterious effect on the foetal brain (i.e. ethanol, cocaine, some drugs including anticonvulsants, some viral infections, maternal diabetes, untreated maternal phenylketonuria); (ii) factors highly suspected to interfere with foetal brain development (i.e. lead and other heavy metals, some drugs like benzodiazepines, nicotine); (iii) factors which have been shown to be safe for the developing brain in the available studies (i.e. low to moderate doses of caffeine, methadone). However, most of these studies do not address the potential risk of environmental factors on minimal to moderate cognitive and behavioural disturbances. Finally, the impact of the neonatal environment on brain development in very pre-term infants is probably underestimated.", 
    "116": "Arecoline. a drug obtained from the Areca Catechu L., induced a dose-dependent antinociception (0.3-1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) which was prevented by the muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine (0.1 microg per mouse i.c.v.) and S-(-)-ET-126 (0.01 microg per mouse i.c.v.). A dose-dependent inhibition of the antinociception induced by arecoline was observed after inactivation of the M1 gene by an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (aODN). This effect was detected 24 h after the last i.c.v. injection of aODN. These results indicate that arecoline antinociception is mediated by the activation of central M1 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "117": "The limited availability of human hepatocytes results in the use of animal cells in most bioartificial liver support devices. In the present work, clinically relevant liver specific metabolic activities were compared in rat, pig and human hepatocytes cultured on liver-derived biomatrix to optimize the expression of differentiated functions. Pig hepatocytes showed higher rates of diazepam metabolism (2.549+/-0.821 microg/h/million cells vs. 0.474+/-0.079 microg/h/million cells rats, p<0.005, and vs. 0.704+/-0.171 microg/h/million cells in man, p<0.005) and of bilirubin conjugation (21.60116+/-8.433237 micromoles/l/24 h vs. 6.786809+/-2.983758 in man, p<0.001 and vs. 9.956538+/-1.781016 micromoles/l/24 h in rats, p<0.005). Urea synthesis was similar in pig and in human hepatocytes (150+/-46.3 vs. 144.8+/-21.46 nmoles/h/million cells) and it was lower in rats (84.38+/-35.2; p<0.001 vs. man, p<0.02 vs. pig). High liver specific metabolic activities in cultured pig hepatocytes further support their use as a substitue for human cells in bioartificial liver devices.", 
    "118": "An C-flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) study in a patient with pallido-pyramidal disease revealed a marked decrease in benzodiazepine-receptor density in the precentral gyrus cortex and the mesial frontal cortex. We suggest that, in addition to dysfunction of basal ganglia-dependent systems, degeneration of the supplementary motor area could also be involved in the patient's bradykinesia.", 
    "119": "Olanzapine is considered a safe drug. However, somnolence appears in up to 39% of the patients treated with 15 mg./day of this drug. The authors describe an elderly patient with chronic lung disease who developed CO2 narcosis and respiratory failure after treatment with olanzapine. The sedative effect of this drug was probably the cause of this life-threatening complication. The authors suggest that elderly patients with chronic lung disease who are treated with olanzapine should be carefully observed, especially during the first weeks of treatment.", 
    "120": "Behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) affect caregiver burden and transition from home to hospital or long-term care. The authors examined change in BPSD for dementia patients (from hospital admission to discharge) who were prescribed haloperidol (n= 289), olanzapine (n=209), or risperidone (n=500). Olanzapine was associated with significantly greater overall improvement in BPSD (based on the Psychogeriatric Dependency Rating Scale total score) than risperidone or haloperidol. Olanzapine was significantly superior on measures of active-, verbal-, and passive-aggression and delusions/hallucinations to risperidone or haloperidol, and, on manipulative behavior and noisiness, to risperidone. Results support the effectiveness of olanzapine in improving several BPSD in hospitalized dementia patients.", 
    "121": "In this report we describe the outcome of eight outpatients with panic disorder and agoraphobia who discontinued their treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in the context of a structured, group program of cognitive-behavior therapy. All patients successfully discontinued their SSRI medication while demonstrating clinical improvement. These results were maintained at 3-month follow-up. This case series suggests that manualized CBT for discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment for panic disorder may be successfully applied to SSRI discontinuation as well.", 
    "122": "Abuse liability of diazepam was examined among experienced drug users. The subjects, randomly divided into two groups, each having eight subjects, received diazepam, 15 mg intravenously (gr. 1) and 30 mg orally (gr. 2). Subjective states, drug liking, sedation and euphoria were assessed at pre-drug, 15 min, 120 min and 240 min post-drug administration. In addition, brief assessment to evaluate euphoria and sedation was carried out at 5 min and 45 min for subjects in gr. 1, and at 45 min and 150 min for those in gr. 2. Plasma diazepam level was also estimated. Results indicate those subjects in gr. 1 reported quicker and higher euphoria, drug liking, subjective effects and higher plasma level. The study suggests that route of administration of a compound which has faster onset of action is associated with more liability of abuse.", 
    "123": "Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) catalyze the prenylation of proteins with a carboxy-terminal tetrapeptide sequence called a CaaX box, where C refers to cysteine, \"a\" refers to an aliphatic residue, and X typically refers to methionine, serine, or glutamine (FTase), or to leucine (GGTase-I). Marsters and co-workers [(1994) Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2, 949--957] developed inhibitors of FTase with cysteine and methionine attached to an inner hydrophobic benzodiazepine scaffold. We found that the most potent of these compounds (BZA-2B) resulted in the time-dependent inhibition of FTase. The K(i) of BZA-2B for FTase, which is the dissociation constant of the initial complex, was 79 +/- 13 nM, and the K(i)*, which is the overall dissociation of inhibitor for all enzyme forms, was 0.91 +/- 0.12 nM. The first-order rate constant for the conversion of the initial complex to the final complex was 1.4 +/- 0.2 min(-1), and that for the reverse process was 0.016 +/- 0.002 min(-1). The latter rate constant corresponds to a half-life of the final complex of 45 min. Our experiments favor the notion that the inhibitor binds to the FTase--farnesyl diphosphate complex which then undergoes an isomerization to form a tighter FTase*--farnesyl diphosphate--BZA2-B complex. Diazepam, a compound with a benzodiazepine nucleus but lacking amino acid extensions, was a weak (K(i) = 870 microM) but not time-dependent inhibitor of FTase. Cys-Val-Phe-Met and Cys-4-aminobenzoyl-Met were instantaneous and not time-dependent inhibitors of FTase. Furthermore, BZA-4B, with a leucine specificity determinant, was a classical competitive inhibitor of GGTase-I and not a time-dependent inhibitor.", 
    "124": "Determinants of individual differences in sleep-wake cycles and vigilance are being recognized as major factors of influence in both physical and mental health. Alterations of an accustomed circadian sleep-wake rhythm are commonly seen in the early stages of the majority of psychiatric disorders and, by themselves, predispose to significant morbidity even in the absence of an underlying illness. While it is well known that disruptions of sleep respond favourably to benzodiazepines, agents which have been prescribed for insomnia since their industrial synthesis in the early 1960s, little attention has been paid to putative central nervous system effects of naturally occurring benzodiazepines. These molecules were found in various nutritive plants and have been quantified in human brain and peripheral blood of drug-naive individuals at trace amounts. There is agreement that elevated concentrations of naturally occurring benzodiazepines participate in the complex pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition asssociated with progressive impairment of consciousness and, ultimately, coma. In the present study, we address the relationship between naturally occurring benzodiazepines and time-of-day effects on the behavior of healthy subjects.", 
    "125": "Two views of catatonia influence clinical practice. In the classical European view, adopted by DSM classifications, the signs of catatonia indicate a form of schizophrenia. In the syndromal view, the signs of catatonia are motor signs that are readily identified in many psychiatric disorders. Catatonia is a parallel behavior phenomenon to delusions (in thought) and delirium (in cognition). The syndromic view includes the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It encourages a different treatment algorithm, the use of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy, to replace the customary use of antipsychotic drugs alone. The benefits of such treatment warrant the recommended change in concept and classification.", 
    "126": "Anxiety disorders often accompany somatic correlates of anxiety such as abdominal trouble and diarrhoea. Nevertheless, misuse of antidiarrhoeals has been described only once. We report on a 34-year-old woman who abused loperamide for over 10 years, taking up to 16 mg per day. Loperamide is an opioid that stimulates opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby inhibiting intestinal secretion and propulsive peristalsis, probably without affecting the central nervous system. As our patient's digestive trouble was a consequence of her states of anxiety, diazepam application helped against her diarrhoea as well. This second strategy of self-medication gained particular importance for her, when even high doses of loperamide stopped having an effect. So she developed a benzodiazepine dependence. As soon as she began treatment as an inpatient, her feelings of anxiety became less and the diarrhoea disappeared.", 
    "127": "Therapeutic drug monitoring data of the new atypical neuroleptic drug olanzapine were used to study interactions with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine and sertraline. The distribution of the ratio of concentration/daily dose (C/D; ng/mL per mg/d) of olanzapine was compared in three groups: patients treated with olanzapine (n = 134), patients treated with olanzapine plus fluvoxamine (n = 10) concomitantly, and patients treated with olanzapine plus sertraline (n = 21) concomitantly. No significant difference was seen between the olanzapine and the olanzapine plus sertraline groups. Patients receiving fluvoxamine in addition to olanzapine had C/D ratios that were in the mean 2.3-fold higher than patients receiving olanzapine without additional fluvoxamine. This indicated that fluvoxamine inhibits the metabolism of olanzapine, probably because of inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, whereas sertraline is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of olanzapine. Combination therapy of olanzapine and fluvoxamine should be used cautiously, and therapeutic drug monitoring should be instituted to avoid olanzapine-induced adverse effects or intoxications.", 
    "128": "To introduce a protocol for dissociative sedation using ketamine for children requiring painful procedures within the emergency department.", 
    "129": "A medical literature search was performed along with a review of existing ketamine-use protocols in emergency departments from Australia and the United States. Our hospital anaesthetic department and our emergency department nursing staff were closely involved in protocol design. A series of nursing education sessions were held prior to the drug being used within the emergency department. Twenty-eight children aged 1.5-12 years were administered ketamine sedation prior to undergoing a painful procedure. Ketamine was administered either i.m. (dose 3-4 mg/kg) or i.v. (dose 1.00-2.75 mg/kg) depending on physician preference. Midazolam (dose 0.02 mg/kg) and atropine (dose 0.02 mg/kg) were given as adjuncts in the majority of cases.", 
    "130": "Onset of sedation was rapid (range 1-7 min) for both routes and provided excellent procedural conditions. Discharge time averaged 103 min (range 67-180 min) from time of drug administration. Side-effects included vomiting, rash, diplopia, salivation and one case of a distressing emergence reaction. On telephone follow up 1-3 days after the sedation, no delayed adverse events were reported.", 
    "131": "Ketamine is a safe and effective sedative agent for use in children requiring immobilization to enable performance of a painful procedure. It is important to involve both anaesthetic staff and emergency department nursing staff in sedation protocol development to ensure a smooth introduction. We present a protocol for ketamine use in children undergoing painful procedures within the emergency department.", 
    "132": "To determine the safety and efficacy of midazolam premedication to minimize the subjective adverse effects of adenosine.", 
    "133": "Double-blind prospective randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to an urban emergency department. Included were a convenience sample of patients who would have received adenosine by the existing department protocol. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, benzodiazepine allergy, regular benzodiazepine medication, alcoholism, altered mental state (precluding informed consent), and age less than 18 or greater than 65 years. Subjects received either 1.5 mg of intravenous midazolam or normal saline placebo 5 min prior to the administration of adenosine. Side-effect recall was judged by a questionnaire at 1 h and 24 h postadenosine administration.", 
    "134": "A total of 34 patients were recruited into the trial, 16 in the placebo group and 18 in the midazolam group. The groups were well matched for demographics, treatment and outcome. There was a significant reduction in the midazolam group for complaint scores of palpitations (P = 0.04) and chest pain (P = 0.02) and a trend to reduction in complaint scores for most other parameters. There were no adverse outcomes in any of the patients studied.", 
    "135": "Co-administration of midazolam can safely reduce the recall of the unpleasant adverse effects of adenosine. Its use may be most appropriate in patients who are particularly anxious or have had previous adverse experiences with adenosine.", 
    "136": "The role of olanzapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia is still unresolved. This article presents an open-label, prospective, 14-week trial with olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder selected for unambiguous resistance to either clozapine or risperidone and to typical antipsychotics. Forty-three inpatients (mean age, 41.6 years; mean duration of illness, 21.7 years) were enrolled and treated after cross-titration from their previous antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine 10 to 40 mg daily without any concomitant antipsychotic medication. Patients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions Scale, and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. The change with olanzapine treatment was associated with a PANSS total score improvement of 3.7 (SD = 15.6; not significant). There was a significant improvement for the PANSS cognitive and depression/anxiety factors, whereas the PANSS excitement factor worsened. The improvement rate was superior in patients receiving olanzapine doses higher than 20 mg. A total of 16.7% of patients reached response criteria set forth by a previous study. There was a significant decrease in extrapyramidal side effects (t = 2.04; p < 0.05) and statistically significant, yet modest, weight gain. These results indicate that olanzapine is only modestly effective in these severely treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia. However, a trial with olanzapine can be recommended in these patients before moving to augmentation strategies, given the lack of proven alternatives and the observation that 16.7% of patients reached the response criteria.", 
    "137": "Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is widely used in the treatment of psychoses associated with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and other psychiatric disorders. Polypharmacology is a necessary condition for the optimal treatment of many patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical illness. One concern raised by the widespread use of multiple concurrent pharmacotherapies is the potential for drug-drug interactions to adversely affect patient outcome. Accordingly, the biomedical literature was reviewed for reports of drug interactions involving risperidone, and the clinical significance of each report was evaluated. Additionally, the potential for risperidone to participate in drug interactions was evaluated by considering the drug's pharmacokinetic properties. Controlled studies and case reports indicate that risperidone has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter risperidone plasma concentrations, but the clinical significance of such interactions seems to be minimal. Adherence to a few guidelines for the design of dosage regimens should limit the effect of drug-drug interactions on patient status and contribute to optimal pharmacotherapy with risperidone.", 
    "138": "There are no rapid-acting intramuscular formulations of atypical antipsychotics available for quickly calming an agitated patient with bipolar disorder. In this study, 201 agitated patients with bipolar mania were randomly assigned to receive one to three injections of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (10 mg, first two injections; 5 mg, third injection), the benzodiazepine lorazepam (2 mg, first two injections; 1 mg, third injection), or placebo (placebo, first two injections; olanzapine, 10 mg, third injection) within a 24-hour period. Agitation was measured at baseline, every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, and at 24 hours after the first injection using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component subscale and two additional agitation scales. At 2 hours after the first injection, patients treated with olanzapine showed a significantly greater reduction in scores on all agitation scales compared with patients treated with either placebo or lorazepam. At 24 hours after the first injection, olanzapine remained statistically superior to placebo in reducing agitation in patients with acute mania, whereas patients treated with lorazepam were not significantly different from those treated with placebo or olanzapine. Furthermore, no significant differences among the three treatment groups were observed in safety measures, including treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, the incidence of acute dystonia, or QTc interval changes. These findings suggest that intramuscular olanzapine is a safe and effective treatment for reducing acute agitation in patients with bipolar mania."
